<text>The Sydney Kings are an Australian men&#x27;s professional basketball team competing in the National Basketball League (NBL). The team is based in Sydney, New South Wales, and play their home games at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney Olympic Park. The Kings were formed from a merger between the West Sydney Westars and the Sydney Supersonics in October 1987. The Kings have won five NBL championships in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2022 and 2023. They were the first team to win three consecutive championships in the NBL and currently sit third behind Melbourne United (six) and the Perth Wildcats (ten) for championships won.

== History ==
=== 1988–2002: First 15 years ===
The Kings were formed from a merger between the West Sydney Westars and the Sydney Supersonics in October 1987. The team adopted the purple-and-gold colours traditionally linked with the most winning team in the NBA during the 1980s, the Los Angeles Lakers.

Before the merger, no Sydney-based teams had ever made the final four in NBL competition. That changed in 1989, when the Kings finished fifth with a 15–9 record and advanced to the semi-finals with a 2–1 win over the Melbourne Tigers. After splitting their first two games in the semi-finals, the Kings were humiliated by the Canberra Cannons 142–82 in the series-deciding third game.

Sydney made the playoffs in 1990, losing in the first round to the Brisbane Bullets. In 1992, led by imports Dwayne McClain (who was named to the All-NBL First Team) and Ken McClary (ranked 5th in the league in rebounds), the Kings finished second on the ladder. This time they advanced to the semi-finals and were beaten by the Tigers, who would eventually lose to the South East Melbourne Magic in the championship series.

Over the next few years the Kings, despite the rich pockets of private owner Mike Wrublewski, earned a reputation for being chronic under-achievers. The team featured high-profile players like Leon Trimmingham, Mario Donaldson, Dean Uthoff and Phil Smyth during the mid-90s but they failed to make the playoffs in 1993 or 1995, and were eliminated in the first round in 1994 and 1996. The team soon received the nickname of &#x27;The Violet Crumbles&#x27;, a popular chocolate bar sold in a purple wrapper; the joke being that the team was wrapped in purple and shattered under pressure. &#x27;The Cardiac Kids&#x27; was another tag, for the team&#x27;s frequency in getting involved in close, thrilling games.

After their 1996 elimination, the Kings would not make the NBL playoffs again until 2001, when they made it to the first round before being eliminated by the Townsville Crocodiles. Australian Olympic team guard Shane Heal was recruited to lead the team, and he finished second in the league in scoring average, behind Olympic teammate Andrew Gaze. Heal finished third in scoring average in the 2001–02 season, but the Kings again failed to make the playoffs.

=== 2003–2008: First championship era ===

For the 2002–03 season, Heal was joined by talented imports Chris Williams and Kavossy Franklin. The team also welcomed the NBL&#x27;s all-time leader in coaching victories, Brian Goorjian. The Kings finished on top of the ladder with a 22–8 record, and swept the Perth Wildcats 2–0 in the grand final series to claim their first-ever championship.

With Goorjian able to implement his defensive tactics which were so successful with the Spectres, Magic and Titans in Melbourne, there seemed to be no stopping the Kings, who were able to recruit quality imports like 2002–03 league MVP Chris Williams. In addition, many Victorian groomed players who had previously played for Goorijan such as Jason Smith and Bradley Sheridan followed him north to Sydney.

Heal retired after the 2002–03 season, and C. J. Bruton was recruited to take his place, Jason Smith was signed after returning to the NBL after playing in Europe but unfortunately was injured 13 games into the season and was replaced by import Chris Carrawell. The Kings started the 2003–04 season with 10 successive wins, and would eventually win their second championship after their best-of-five grand final series with crosstown rivals West Sydney Razorbacks went down to the deciding fifth game. Kings player Matt Nielsen would win the regular season and finals MVP in 2003–04 before leaving to play overseas.

The Kings again performed strongly in the 2004–05 season despite a disastrous early game against Townsville which saw C. J. Bruton out for weeks with an elbow injury, and a season-ending ACL tear for rookie of the year candidate Luke Kendall. The Kings managed without their starting backcourt until Bruton came back and they signed import big man Rolan Roberts. Arguably stronger than before the Kings finished on top of the ladder and crushed the Wollongong Hawks in three straight games to become the first team in Australian league history to win three consecutive championships. Jason Smith was named the NBL Finals Most Valuable Player.

In the 2005–06 season, the Kings again finished atop the ladder and made it to the grand final. Import centre Rolan Roberts suffered a torn pectoral muscle imitating a Vince Carter dunk during the All Star dunk competition and was replaced by Sedric Webber. In the finals they were swept 3–0 by the Chris Anstey led Melbourne Tigers. The club was then purchased in 2006 for $2 million by the chairman of fuel technology company Firepower International, Tim Johnston. Johnston later sold a part share in 2007 to 31-year-old Dorry Kordahi, CEO and owner of DKM.

The 2006–07 season would see the Kings continue their success into the post-season despite losing star guard C. J. Bruton in the previous off-season to the Brisbane Bullets. The Kings faced off against the Bruton led Bullets in the semi-finals losing 2–0 while captain and key player Jason Smith attempted to play through a broken hand.

A finals rematch was on the table for the Kings in the 2007–08 season facing off against the Melbourne Tigers once again. The series this time would go to the deciding 5th game, which among rumours of a potential collapse for the club and uncertainty around playing contracts and future, saw the Kings lose 3–2 to the Tigers at home.

=== 2008–2010: Club demise ===
On 24 March 2008, coach Brian Goorjian quit the club after a mutual agreement, and on 12 June 2008, the NBL terminated the Sydney team&#x27;s licence as Firepower collapsed and the Kings were unable to pay player salaries.

=== 2010–2012: Kings relaunch ===
Under a revised management structure and ownership, the Sydney Kings relaunched for the 2010–11 NBL season, returning to the league after a two-year absence. However, despite big-named additions such as Julian Khazzouh, Ben Madgen and Luke Martin, the Kings in their first season back finished in last place on the ladder with an 8–20 record.

Due to the 2011 NBA Lockout, Australia&#x27;s highest profile basketballer, former Milwaukee Bucks centre Andrew Bogut, was looking to play in the NBL during the 2011–12 season. He was linked with the Adelaide 36ers, the Gold Coast Blaze and the Kings, whom Bogut had supported when growing up in Australia. Sydney was favored to secure his services and Bogut ultimately chose to make his NBL debut with the Kings. However, the insurance to cover his remaining US$39 million contract with the Bucks could not be resolved, leaving the Kings and the NBL without the services of Australia&#x27;s highest profile player. It was expected that Bogut&#x27;s signing would see an increase in Kings membership and league attendances. Despite not being able to play, Bogut later expressed interest in joining the Kings&#x27; coaching staff during the lockout to help the club. This ultimately did not happen either.

The Kings fared better in 2011–12, finishing the season in seventh spot with an 11–17 record.

=== 2012–2018: Continued struggles ===
The Kings continued to struggle over the ensuing six years, qualifying just once (2012–13) for the playoffs in their eight seasons since returning to the league, and finishing with a losing record in the regular season in each of their eight seasons. In November 2015, the club played their 800th game in franchise history. Australian basketball icon Andrew Gaze was named head coach of the team on a three-year deal starting with the 2016–17 season. The team recruited big names Kevin Lisch, Brad Newley and Aleks Marić plus imports Greg Whittington and Michael Bryson for the 2016–17 season; however after starting the season with five wins in their opening six games, the Kings won just eight of their remaining 22 games and missed the playoffs.

Before the 2017–18 season, the team recruited imports Perry Ellis and Travis Leslie plus small forward Todd Blanchfield; however fared no better, losing 16 of their first 21 games as Lisch suffered a calf injury that would force him to miss most of the regular season. Late in the campaign the club brought in 2016–17 NBL MVP Jerome Randle and big man Jeremy Tyler. Randle led the team to six wins in their final seven games and was named to the All-NBL Second Team, but the Kings missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.

=== 2018–2021: Return to the finals ===
The 2018–19 season was the Kings&#x27; 30th anniversary season in the NBL. On 24 April 2018, the Kings announced the signing of Australian basketball icon, Andrew Bogut. In that same offseason, the Kings became the first beneficiary of the NBL&#x27;s new Next Stars program, which offers a professional option immediately out of secondary school to Americans (who are currently barred from the NBA draft until one year after graduation), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball. Under the program, the team signed American Brian Bowen. After a 18–10 record across the 2018–19 season, the club recorded their first finals appearance since 2013 however lost 2–0 to Melbourne United in the semi-finals. Andrew Bogut would receive MVP honours becoming the 3rd King to receive the award and the first in 15 years.

After Andrew Gaze left the club under a mutual agreement, Will Weaver was signed as the new head coach. In Weaver&#x27;s first season with the club, the Kings were minor champions for the first time in over a decade and made it through to the grand final series, however after three games the Kings indicated they did not wish to proceed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and forfeited the series to the Perth Wildcats.

=== 2021–present: Second championship era ===
In the 2021–22 season, the Kings won 13 straight games, equalling the second-longest winning streak in franchise history set between the end of the 2003 season and the beginning of 2004. Jaylen Adams received MVP honours becoming the 4th King to receive the award. Sydney would go on to sweep both the Illawarra Hawks and Tasmania Jack Jumpers en route to the franchise&#x27;s 4th NBL championship. Xavier Cooks received the 2021–22 Finals Most Valuable Player award.

The 2022–23 season saw the Kings retain a large portion of their local talent but enlist a new import trio from the likes of Derrick Walton, Justin Simon and Tim Soares. The Kings would continue their dominant performance from the previous season leading to a 19–9 record and the minor premiership, with captain Xavier Cooks taking the honours of MVP, the 5th in Kings history and 3rd in the last 5 years. The finals would prove to be a more arduous journey than the 2022 finals having to face the 3rd seeded Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals after the Taipans lost their first seeding game, who the Kings would go on to defeat 2–1. The New Zealand Breakers would face the Kings in the Grand Final series with both franchises competing for their 5th championship. The Kings defeated the Breakers 3–2 in the best of 5 series after a comeback game 5 win at home to lift the franchise to back-to-back titles. Derrick Walton was named 2022–23 Finals Most Valuable Player.

== Home arena ==
The Sydney Kings&#x27; first home venue was the State Sports Centre located at Homebush Bay. After playing at the 5,006-seat venue in 1988 and 1989, the Kings then moved into Sydney&#x27;s largest indoor venue, the 12,500-seat Sydney Entertainment Centre in 1990. The SEC, known for Kings games as &quot;The Kingdome&quot;, would be the Kings&#x27; home until the team moved back to Homebush Bay in 1999 and into the new, 18,200-capacity Sydney Superdome which had been built as the main basketball and gymnastics venue for the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney.

Despite attracting an NBL-record 17,143 crowd for their opening-round game in the 1999–2000 season against the Canberra Cannons (played as a double header with the West Sydney Razorbacks playing the Brisbane Bullets), the Kings&#x27; time at the Superdome only lasted three years. After the club went into voluntary administration following the 2001–02 season and was then purchased by a new investment group, the franchise decided to move back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, citing falling attendances and the high cost of playing their games at the NBA-size venue. It was also speculated at the time that the core of the Kings fan base came from the eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney and that fans were not enthused about having to travel to Homebush Bay for games.

The Kings moved back to the Entertainment Centre in 2002, where they remained until 2015, though they were forced to move one game in the 2012–13 NBL season to the State Sports Centre due to a pre-booked event taking priority at the Entertainment Centre. At its closing in 2015, the SEC had a basketball capacity of 10,517 (with curtains blocking off seats behind the basket to reduce capacity) giving the Kings the second-largest capacity venue in the NBL behind the 14,846-seat Perth Arena, though as the SEC was opened in 1983 it also gave the Kings the league&#x27;s oldest venue.

The Kings moved back to Homebush Bay midway through the 2015–16 season due to the SEC being demolished to make way for an apartment complex and convention centre. On 13 March 2016, the Kings came under new management and were subsequently moved back to the Superdome (Qudos Bank Arena) for the 2016–17 season. During the regular season, the Kings curtained off the upper deck of the Qudos Bank Arena (depending on ticket demand), leaving capacity at approximately 9,000. In the final home game of the 2016–17 season, the Kings drew 11,005 fans to their game against Melbourne United—at the time, the second-largest home crowd in franchise history.

In the 2019–20 season alone, six of the top ten home crowds in franchise history attended games at Qudos Bank Arena.

The Kings averaged 10,012 fans per home game in the 2019–20 NBL season—the largest per-game average at home in franchise history and became the first Sydney Kings team to ever average more than 10,000 fans per home game. The total home fan attendance for the season was 140,168—the largest in franchise history and nearly 20,000 fans more than the previous record set in 1994.

Attendance Records

The Sydney Kings have set attendance records for the league on five occasions while playing at the Superdome, the largest capacity arena in the NBL.

In the 1999–2000 season, the Kings hosted a double header at the Superdome with the West Sydney Razorbacks playing the Brisbane Bullets and the Kings playing the Canberra Cannons. This double header set a league record of 17,143 fans in attendance.

In a game against the Illawarra Hawks on 17 November 2019, the Kings set the all-time NBL single-game attendance record with 17,514 the Superdome. A major drawcard for the game was future NBA star and social media icon LaMelo Ball playing for the Hawks.

In game 3 of the 2022 NBL Grand Final series against the Tasmania Jack Jumpers at Qudos Bank Arena, the team attracted a crowd of 16,149—then the biggest playoff crowd in NBL history and the third-largest crowd overall in NBL history.

In the Grand Final Series of the 2022–23 season against the New Zealand Breakers the Sydney Kings set the new single-game attendance record and playoff game attendance record twice. With the Kings having home-court advantage, games 1, 3 and 5 were played at the Superdome. On Friday 10 March 2023, a new record of 18,049 attended game 3 of the series.

Just five days later with the series at tied 2 wins each, the Kings prevailed in game 5 to win the championship in front of another record attendance of 18,124.

<doc id="1082946" wikidata="Q3097928" url="?curid=1082946" title="Hydrodynamical helicity">
<text>In fluid dynamics, helicity is, under appropriate conditions, an invariant of the Euler equations of fluid flow, having a topological interpretation as a measure of linkage and/or knottedness of vortex lines in the flow. This was first proved by Jean-Jacques Moreau in 1961 and Moffatt derived it in 1969 without the knowledge of Moreau&#x27;s paper. This helicity invariant is an extension of Woltjer&#x27;s theorem for magnetic helicity.

Let formula_1 be the velocity field and formula_2 the corresponding vorticity field. Under the following three conditions, the vortex lines are transported with (or &#x27;frozen in&#x27;) the flow: (i) the fluid is inviscid; (ii) either the flow is incompressible (formula_3), or it is compressible with a barotropic relation formula_4 between pressure and density ; and (iii) any body forces acting on the fluid are conservative. Under these conditions, any closed surface whose normal vectors are orthogonal to the vorticity (that is, formula_5) is, like vorticity, transported with the flow.

Let be the volume inside such a surface. Then the helicity in , denoted , is defined by the volume integral

:formula_6

For a localised vorticity distribution in an unbounded fluid, can be taken to be the whole space, and is then the total helicity of the flow. is invariant precisely because the vortex lines are frozen in the flow and their linkage and/or knottedness is therefore conserved, as recognized by Lord Kelvin (1868). Helicity is a pseudo-scalar quantity: it changes sign under change from a right-handed to a left-handed frame of reference; it can be considered as a measure of the handedness (or chirality) of the flow. Helicity is one of the four known integral invariants of the Euler equations; the other three are energy, momentum and angular momentum.

For two linked unknotted vortex tubes having circulations formula_7 and formula_8, and no internal twist, the helicity is given by formula_9, where is the Gauss linking number of the two tubes, and the plus or minus is chosen according as the linkage is right- or left-handed.
For a single knotted vortex tube with circulation formula_10, then, as shown by Moffatt &amp; Ricca (1992), the helicity is given by formula_11, where formula_12 and formula_13 are the writhe and twist of the tube; the sum formula_14 is known to be invariant under continuous deformation of the tube.

The invariance of helicity provides an essential cornerstone of the subject topological fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, which is concerned with global properties of flows and their topological characteristics.

==Meteorology==
In meteorology, helicity corresponds to the transfer of vorticity from the environment to an air parcel in convective motion. Here the definition of helicity is simplified to only use the horizontal component of wind and vorticity, and to only integrate in the vertical direction, replacing the volume integral with a one-dimensional definite integral or line integral:

:formula_15

where
* is the altitude,
* is the horizontal velocity,
* is the horizontal vorticity.

According to this formula, if the horizontal wind does not change direction with altitude, will be zero as formula_16 and formula_17 are perpendicular, making their scalar product nil. is then positive if the wind veers (turns clockwise) with altitude and negative if it backs (turns counterclockwise). This helicity used in meteorology has energy units per units of mass [m/s] and thus is interpreted as a measure of energy transfer by the wind shear with altitude, including directional.

This notion is used to predict the possibility of tornadic development in a thundercloud. In this case, the vertical integration will be limited below cloud tops (generally 3 km or 10,000 feet) and the horizontal wind will be calculated to wind relative to the storm in subtracting its motion:

::formula_18
where is the cloud motion relative to the ground.

Critical values of SRH (Storm Relative Helicity) for tornadic development, as researched in North America, are:

* SRH = 150-299 ... supercells possible with weak tornadoes according to Fujita scale
* SRH = 300-499 ... very favourable to supercells development and strong tornadoes
* SRH &gt; 450 ... violent tornadoes
* When calculated only below 1 km (4,000 feet), the cut-off value is 100.

Helicity in itself is not the only component of severe thunderstorms, and these values are to be taken with caution. That is why the Energy Helicity Index (EHI) has been created. It is the result of SRH multiplied by the CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) and then divided by a threshold CAPE:

:formula_19

This incorporates not only the helicity but the energy of the air parcel and thus tries to eliminate weak potential for thunderstorms even in strong SRH regions. The critical values of EHI:

* EHI = 1 ... possible tornadoes
* EHI = 1-2 ... moderate to strong tornadoes
* EHI &gt; 2 ... strong tornadoes

<doc id="1082961" wikidata="Q217374" url="?curid=1082961" title="Ligue 2">
<text>Ligue 2 (, League 2), also known as Ligue 2 [[Balkrishna Industries|BKT]] due to sponsorship reasons, is a French professional football league. The league serves as the second division of French football and is one of two divisions making up the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), the other being Ligue 1, the country&#x27;s top football division. Contested by 18 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with both Ligue 1 and the third division Championnat National. Seasons run from August to May, with teams playing 34 games each, totalling 306 games in the season. Most games are played on Fridays and Mondays, with a few games played during weekday and weekend evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before Christmas for two weeks before returning in the second week of January.

Ligue 2 was founded a year after the creation of the first division in 1933 under the name &quot;Division 2&quot; and has served as the second division of French football ever since. The name lasted until 2002 before switching to its current name. Since the league is a part of the LFP, it allows clubs who are on the brink of professionalism to become so.

== History ==
The second division of French football was established in 1933, one year after the creation of the all-professional first division. The inaugural season of the competition consisted of the six clubs who were relegated following the 1932–33 National season, as well as many of the clubs who opposed the creation of the first division the previous season. Clubs such as Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, and Amiens SC all played in the second division&#x27;s debut season despite having prior grievances with the subjective criteria needed to become professional and play in the first division. The first year of the second division consisted of twenty-three clubs and were divided into two groups (&quot;Nord&quot; and &quot;Sud&quot;). Fourteen of the clubs were inserted into the &quot;Nord&quot; section, while the remaining nine were placed in &quot;Sud&quot;. Following the season, the winner of each group faced each other to determine which club would earn promotion. On 20 May 1934, the winner of the &quot;Nord&quot; group, Red Star Saint-Ouen, faced Olympique Alès, the winner of the &quot;Sud&quot; group. Red Star were crowned the league&#x27;s inaugural champions following a 3–2 victory. Despite losing, Alès was also promoted to the first division and they were followed by Strasbourg and Mulhouse, who each won a pool championship, after the first division agreed to expand its teams to 16.

Due to several clubs merging, folding, or losing their professional status, the federation turned the second division into a 16-team league and adopted the single-table method for the 1934–35 season. Due to the unpredictable nature of French football clubs, the following season, the league increased to 19 clubs and, two years later, increased its allotment to 25 teams with the clubs being divided into four groups. Because of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel. Following the end of the war, the second division developed stability. Due to the increase in amateur clubs, the league intertwined professional and amateur clubs and allowed the latter to become professional if they met certain benchmarks. In 2002, the league changed its name from &quot;Division 2&quot; to &quot;Ligue 2&quot;.

In November 2014, the presidents of Caen and Nîmes were amongst several arrested on suspicion of match fixing. The arrests followed a 1–1 draw between Caen and Nîmes in May 2014, a result very beneficial for each club.

==Competition format==
There are 18 clubs in Ligue 2. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion and automatically promoted to Ligue 1. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship or for relegation, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The second-place finisher are also promoted automatically to the first division. The fourth and fifth-place finishers play a one leg fixture at the fourth-place finisher&#x27;s stadium, the winner of this fixture faces the third-place finisher at the third-place finisher&#x27;s stadium, the winner of this fixture plays the 16th-placed team in Ligue 1 for the right to play in Ligue 1 the following season. The three lowest placed teams are relegated to the Championnat National and the top three teams from National are promoted in their place. While a decision was originally made that during the 2015–16 season only the best two teams would be promoted to Ligue 1, and the last two teams would be relegated to the National, that decision was later overturned by an appeal to the Conseil d&#x27;État and the French Football Federation.

In December 2021, the majority of LFP member clubs, including Championnat National club leaders, voted to contract Ligue 2 from 20 to 18 clubs for the 2024–25 season. This happened one year after Ligue 1 itself dropped from 20 to 18 teams for the 2023–24 season. The plan was for Ligue 2 to relegate four clubs to, and promote two from, National at the end of 2023–24.

<text>Gregory William Hands (born 14 November 1965) is a British politician who served as Minister for London and Minister of State for Trade Policy from November 2023 to July 2024. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelsea and Fulham, previously Hammersmith and Fulham, from 2005 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as its Chairman from February to November 2023. Hands has served as Minister of State for Trade Policy under four prime ministers, holding the office on four occasions, ranging from 2016 to 2024, and also served as Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth from 2021 to 2022.

Hands was the MP for Chelsea and Fulham from 2010 to 2024; the constituency was created that year by the splitting of the former constituencies of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham. Prior to these boundary changes, he served as the MP for the Hammersmith and Fulham constituency from 2005.

Hands served in Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2015 until 2016. He voted for the UK to remain in the European Union during the 2016 Brexit referendum. Following the referendum vote and Cameron&#x27;s consequent resignation, Hands was demoted by the new prime minister Theresa May to a junior ministerial position at the Department for International Trade. Following the snap 2017 general election, Hands retained his position as Minister of State for Trade and Investment but also undertook the Minister for London role, replacing Gavin Barwell who lost his seat. Hands resigned in 2018, citing his opposition to the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport, but returned to the position as Minister of State for Trade Policy in February 2020 under Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

In September 2021, Hands was appointed Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth. Following Johnson&#x27;s resignation on 6 September 2022, Hands left that position and briefly returned to the backbenches before being appointed to his former role as Minister of State for Trade Policy by Prime Minister Liz Truss on 9 October 2022. Following Truss&#x27;s resignation, he was retained as Trade Minister by new prime minister Rishi Sunak. Following the dismissal of Nadhim Zahawi in January 2023, Hands was promoted to Chairman of the Conservative Party by Sunak on 7 February 2023, but was sacked from this role on 13 November 2023. The same day, he was appointed to the role of Minister of State for Trade Policy. He was appointed Minister for London for a second time a day later.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, he was unseated by Ben Coleman from the Labour Party.

==Early life and career==
Gregory Hands was born on 14 November 1965 to British parents in New York City. He lived in the United States until he was seven years old and his family moved back to the UK. He was educated at state schools in England, and completed his secondary education at Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School, Amersham in 1984.

During his gap year Hands worked in a swimming pool in Berlin where he gained the nickname “Tapper;” he became interested in the Eastern Bloc, visiting Prague and other Eastern European cities on future holidays.

He went on to attend Robinson College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first in Modern History in 1989. He joined the Conservative Party as a student, served as the chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association, and was on the executive committee of the Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union.

Hands spent eight years after university in banking. He worked on trading floors in derivatives at the City of London and New York City until 1997.

==Political career==
Hands was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in 1998. He became the leader of the Conservative group in 1999, remaining in that capacity until 2003.

===In opposition===
At the 2005 general election, Hands was elected to Parliament as MP for Hammersmith and Fulham, winning with 45.4% of the vote and a majority of 5,029.

In his maiden speech on 26 May 2005, Hands referred to the fact that the BBC was the largest employer in his constituency and that Hammersmith Broadway was the busiest road interchange in Europe.

Hands quickly became interested in the subject of MPs expenses, causing the whips to attempt to dissuade him.

In 2007, Hands was selected to be the Conservative candidate for the new Chelsea and Fulham parliamentary constituency. His previous seat of Hammersmith and Fulham was abolished for the 2010 general election, with Hammersmith having its own seat (being fought by Shaun Bailey for the Conservatives), and Fulham joining Chelsea in a new seat. In January 2009, Hands was appointed to the Conservative front bench team as a shadow Treasury minister. He also became the Parliamentary chairman of Conservative Friends of Poland.

===In government===
====Cameron–Clegg coalition====
At the 2010 general election, Hands was elected as MP for the newly created constituency of Chelsea and Fulham, winning with 60.5% of the vote and a majority of 16,722. After the election, Hands served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, having shadowed the Treasury in opposition.

On 14 October 2011, Hands was appointed as an assistant government whip in the House of Commons as a consequence of the mini-reshuffle following the resignation of Liam Fox as Secretary of State for Defence.

In 2013, Hands voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in England and Wales.

Hands was appointed Government Deputy Chief Whip and Treasurer of the Household in October 2013. In March 2014, he was sworn as a Privy Counsellor, entitling him to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

====Majority Cameron government====
At the 2015 general election, Hands was re-elected as MP as Chelsea and Fulham with an increased vote share of 62.9% and a decreased majority of 16,022. Following the election, Hands was promoted by David Cameron to the Cabinet in the position of Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

Hands campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum. In the lead-up to the referendum, Hands led the Chelsea and Fulham Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. During the campaign, Hands issued warnings of the consequences for the UK should it leave the European Union, saying that the country would face &quot;profound consequences&quot; including &quot;fewer jobs, higher prices in our shops and less money for our public services like the NHS&quot;. A strong advocate of international trade, he described the European Union&#x27;s Single Market as being the &quot;most complete commitment to free trade that exists&quot;.

====May government====
In the 2016 reshuffle following the EU referendum and Theresa May&#x27;s appointment as prime minister, he was made Minister of State for Trade Policy at the newly formed Department for International Trade.

Following the referendum, Hands argued that the UK should leave the European Union with a deal. To justify his changed position regarding the UK outside of the European Union, Hands argued that in &quot;the long term&quot; the UK could &quot;independently conclude better contracts with third countries&quot;. Hands voted against the Withdrawal Agreement in the first Meaningful Vote, but voted in favour of it in the second and third meaningful votes, stating that the deal had been improved.

At the snap 2017 general election, Hands was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 52.6% and a decreased majority of 8,188.

Following the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 71 people, Hands called for the Notting Hill Carnival to be moved. He said, &quot;We have to ask ourselves if it is appropriate to stage a Carnival in the near proximity of a major national disaster.&quot; The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, dismissed Hands&#x27; proposal.

On 21 June 2018, Hands resigned his ministerial post to vote against a third runway at Heathrow Airport.

Following the third defeat of the Brexit withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons in March 2019, Hands co-chaired the Prosperity UK Alternative Arrangements Commission. This body looked at alternatives to the Irish backstop.

Alongside former neighbouring MPs Justine Greening and Zac Goldsmith, Hands has been critical of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham&#x27;s April 2019 decision to close Hammersmith Bridge to motor vehicles, and has called for the bridge to be promptly repaired and re-opened.

During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, Hands was one of the first MPs to declare their support for Jeremy Hunt. During the campaign, Hands wrote to Boris Johnson requesting that he review the Government&#x27;s decision to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Hunt ultimately lost the contest to Johnson in the final round.

====Johnson government====
Hands was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 49.9% and an increased majority of 11,241.

Hands was appointed Minister of State for Trade Policy in the second Johnson ministry during the 2020 cabinet reshuffle.

In May 2020, Parliament&#x27;s Standards and Privileges Committee censured Hands for misusing public funds relating to stationery and pre-paid House of Commons envelopes. In November 2021, Hands followed his party three line whip to vote to overhaul the Standards and Privileges Committee.

==== Truss government ====
Hands was appointed Minister of State for Trade Policy on 9 October 2022.

==== Sunak government ====
Following the firing of Nadhim Zahawi in January 2023, Hands was appointed as his replacement as Chairman of the Conservative Party in a subsequent cabinet reshuffle. As chairman, Hands was responsible for party administration and the organisation of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. In the November 2023 British cabinet reshuffle, Hands was replaced as Conservative Party chairman, and Hands returned to the role of Minister of State for Trade Policy. Returning to his previous brief, he joked, &quot;I even kept my business cards from last time.&quot; Hands was made Minister of London as well.

==Personal life==
Hands has dual American/British nationality. He lives in Fulham with his German wife Irina, and their son and daughter. Hands says that he speaks five European languages, including German and Czech.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, his father, Edward, died with COVID-19 in a UK care home.

Hands supports Plymouth Argyle and has appeared as a guest at supporters&#x27; association events.

<text>Permanent crop means that the land continues to produce year after year, without the farmer needing to replant fields after each harvest.

Traditionally, &quot;arable land&quot; included any land suitable for the growing of crops, even if it was actually being used for the production of permanent crops such as grapes or peaches. Modern agricultureparticularly organizations such as the CIA and FAOprefer the term of art to describe such cultivable land that is not being used for annually-harvested crops such as staple grains. In such usage, permanent cropland is a form of agricultural land that includes grasslands and shrublands used to grow grape vines or coffee; orchards used to grow fruit or olives; and forested plantations used to grow nuts or rubber. It does not include, however, tree farms intended to be used for wood or timber.

<text>Air fresheners are products designed to reduce unwanted odors in indoor spaces, to introduce pleasant fragrances, or both. They typically emit fragrance to mask odors but may use other methods of action such as absorbing, bonding to, or chemically altering compounds in the air that produce smells, killing organisms that produce smells, or disrupting the sense of smell to reduce perception of unpleasant smells.

There are many different types of air fresheners that deliver their active ingredients in different ways, including sprays, candles, reed diffusers, scented beads, gels, passive and active evaporating diffusers, atomizers, automatically timed metered aerosol dispensers, electric fan air fresheners, and plug-ins. Air fresheners are used in domestic and commercial settings and in both small and large spaces. Some air fresheners are produced for specific spaces and odors, such as car fresheners and urinal deodorizer blocks. Some air fresheners contain ingredients that provoke allergy and asthma symptoms or are toxic. Air freshening also involves the use of organic and everyday household items.

==History==
Fragrances have been used to mask odors since antiquity. A variety of methods and compounds have been used over the past two millennia for their abilities to create pleasant aromas or eliminate unpleasant odors in indoor spaces. These were often linked with spiritual or religious practices (e.g. the use of incense), or with concepts of health and hygiene. Consumer products for air freshening began to emerge in the late 1800s which coincided with the arrival of the first synthetically produced fragrances. However, air freshening consumer products first gained wider popularity in the 1940s.
In 1939, Air Wick launched in the United States, initially producing liquid air fresheners in a variety of fragrances, which worked by evaporation with the help of a wick. The products claimed to kill odors, not just mask them, by using chlorophyll. As early as 1953, scientists were questioning whether chlorophyll, at the time popular as a body deodorizer or for use on wounds, really acted as a space deodorizer. From 1947 to 1951, the company sold 7 million dollars&#x27; worth of these and other types of
air fresheners.

The first fan-operated air freshener product was invented in 1946 and released by the company Surco under the brand &quot;Air-Scent&quot; in 1948.

In the United States, commercial aerosol sprays were introduced in 1948, based on what had been a military technology for dispensing insecticides. The product delivered a fine mist of aroma compounds that would remain suspended in the air for an extended period of time. 

In the 1950s, many companies began to add chemicals that counteract odors to their fragrance formulas. These chemicals, intended to neutralize or destroy odors, included unsaturated esters, pre-polymers, and long-chain aldehydes.

In the 1980s, the air freshener market shifted back away from aerosols due to concerns over the destruction of the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which were used as a propellant. Many other air freshener delivery methods have become popular since, including under the seat wafer air fresheners, scented candles, reed diffusers, potpourri, and heat release products.

==Basic principles==
Air fresheners introduce fragrance into the air of interior spaces either as droplets which transition to vapor, or as the molecules of fragrance ingredients directly evaporating from a source. Fragrance diffuses into the air to mask other odors or to introduce a specific odor.

===Mechanisms of odor control===
Mechanisms for the control of indoor airborne odors can be grouped into various different classes:
* Masking: a pleasant odor may be used to overwhelm unwanted odors.
* Adsorption: adsorbents like zeolite, activated charcoal, or silica gel may be used to capture odor-producing compounds.
* Oxidation: ozone can oxidize and eliminate organic sources of odors from the air.
* Disinfection: odors caused by microorganisms can be removed by inactivating them using air sanitizers.

===Delivery: continuous vs. instant action===

Delivery of the above air freshener mechanisms falls into two broad categories: continuous action and instant action. 

Continuous action products include scented candles and devices which use a candle flame or some other heat source to heat and vaporize a fragrance formulation, incense burners, wall plug-ins which either use piezoelectric technology to aerosolize fragrance or heat to vaporize it, fragrance impregnated gels which release fragrance as the gel evaporates sometimes with the help of an electric fan, wick and reed diffusers which release fragrance by evaporation from fragrance-soaked wicks or wooden reeds; and fragrance impregnated materials like floor wax, paper, plastics, wood which release fragrance by off gassing; and lastly nebulization systems which convert liquid fragrances into a vapor in a cold process without the use of heat.

Instant action systems are mainly aerosol or atomizer sprays. The aerosol spray uses a propellant and fragrance packaged under pressure in a sealed metal container with a valve which is opened by pressing down a button which contains a spray nozzle – the actuator. When the container&#x27;s valve is opened by pressing the actuator, fragrance is forced through the spray nozzle located inside the actuator to create a mist of droplets containing fragrance. These droplets are 30 to 50 micrometres in diameter. A recently developed alternative, the &quot;bag-on-valve&quot; aerosol, places the air freshener inside a bag in the can. The can is filled with pressurised air which squeezes the bag and pushes out the product when the actuator is pressed. An atomizer operates in a similar fashion except that the actuator is a pump which when pressed a few times creates the pressure to aspirate the fragrance from the container through a tube into the actuator and spray nozzle. Because the container is not constantly under pressure it may be made of glass or plastic as well as metal. The mist created contains droplets 50 to 150 micrometres in diameter.

== Ingredients ==
In addition to the fragrances, adsorbents, oxidizers, surfactants, and disinfectants listed above, air fresheners can also contain aerosol propellants, preservatives, and solvents.

===Fragrances===
Air fresheners use both synthesized and organically occurring fragrances. Common fragrances used include lyral and citronellal. Preparations often include terpenes such as limonene. 

===Aerosol propellants===
A propellant is usually a liquid gas substance used to physically propel the product out of an aerosol spray. The substance chosen needs to be a gas that turns to liquid when pressurized with a relatively low amount of pressure, safe for domestic use. The propellant is a liquid when under pressure in the can, but maintains the pressure in the can (and thereby its spraying ability) by turning partially back to a gas to fill any empty space. Less common compressed gas propellants work similarly but maintain pressure by filling the empty space without liquefying. The propellant in a true aerosol is mixed with the air freshener, so it must also not react with the product. Sometimes, multiple propellants are combined.

CFCs were once popular propellants but are no longer widely used because of their damaging effects on the ozone layer and resulting bans. Current propellants used in air freshener sprays include:
* hydrocarbon aerosol propellant (HAP) blends: mixtures including propane, n-butane and isobutane
* dimethyl ether
* hydrofluorocarbon propellants (HFCs) such as 1,1-difluoroethane
* hydrofluoroolefin propellants (HFOs) such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene HFOs have recently become more widely used due to their low vapor pressure, low global warming potential (GWP), and nonflammability.

Note that while bag-on-valve systems may use compressed air, nitrogen or carbon dioxide or other substances to squeeze the air freshener from the bag, these are not strictly ingredients because they are not mixed with the air freshener, and remain in the can.

===Preservatives===
Preservatives prevent the decomposition of the product or the growth of microorganisms in it. These can include:
* parabens such as methylparaben and propylparaben
* isothiazolinones such as methylisothiazoline and benzisothiazolinone
* formaldehyde releasers such as DMDM hydantoin

===Solvents, emulsifiers and surfactants===
These are substances that help other ingredients mix together, either by dissolving or emulsifying.

Solvents used in air fresheners include ethanol, mineral oil, or glycol ethers such as 2-butoxyethanol and trideceth-4.

==Toxicity and hazards==
There have been various concerns about air fresheners having adverse health effects, due to factors including harmful ingredients, secondary substances formed by the chemical interactions of ingredients with other substances, allergy-provoking ingredients, misuse, and accidental injury.

===Harmful ingredients and secondary substances===
Many air fresheners employ carcinogens, volatile organic compounds and known toxins such as phthalate esters in their formulas. A Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) study of 13 common household air fresheners found that most of the surveyed products contain chemicals that can aggravate asthma and affect reproductive development. The NRDC called for more rigorous supervision of the manufacturers and their products, which are widely assumed to be safe:

The study assessed scented sprays, gels, and plug-in air fresheners. Independent lab testing confirmed the presence of phthalates, or hormone-disrupting chemicals that may pose a particular health risk to babies and young children, in 12 of the 14 products—including those marked &#x27;all natural.&#x27; None of the products had these chemicals listed on their labels.

On September 19, 2007, along with the Sierra Club, Alliance for Healthy Homes, and the National Center for Healthy Housing, the NRDC filed a petition with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to report the findings.

Research at the University of Colorado at Boulder revealed the carcinogenic nature of paradichlorobenzene (PCDB) and naphthalene, present in some types of air fresheners. The pesticide substances were mainly used in mothballs but also in room sprays and toilet rim blocks.

The University of Bristol&#x27;s Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found that exposure to volatile organic compounds through frequent use of air fresheners and other aerosols in the home was found to correlate with increased earaches and diarrhea in infants, and with increased depression and headaches in their mothers.

In 2008, Anne C. Steinemann of the University of Washington published a study of top-selling air fresheners and laundry products. She found that all products tested gave off chemicals regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws, including carcinogens with no safe exposure level, but none of these chemicals were listed on any of the product labels or material safety data sheets. Chemicals included acetone, the active ingredient in paint thinner and nail-polish remover; chloromethane, a neurotoxicant and respiratory toxicant; and acetaldehyde and 1,4-dioxane, both carcinogens. A plug-in air freshener contained more than 20 different volatile organic compounds, with more than one-third classified as toxic or hazardous under federal laws. Even air fresheners called &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;green,&quot; or with &quot;essential oils&quot; emitted hazardous chemicals, including carcinogens.

A report issued in 2005 by the Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC) found that many air freshener products emit allergens and toxic air pollutants including benzene, formaldehyde, terpenes, styrene, phthalate esters, and toluene.

In the United States, since 2020 air fresheners (as well as cleaning solutions and products used to clean cars) have been required to list any of their ingredients which are on California&#x27;s list of 2,300 harmful chemicals, based on a California law passed in 2017. A California study in 2006 found that the prominent products of the reaction of terpenes found in air fresheners with ozone included formaldehyde, hydroxyl radical, and secondary ultrafine particles. It is not clear if manufacturers will need to list such chemicals which are not ingredients, but form during deployment and are thus able to affect human health.

===Allergens and irrtants===
In 2009, Stanley M. Caress of the University of West Georgia and Anne C. Steinemann of the University of Washington published results from two national epidemiological studies of health effects from exposure to air fresheners. They found that nearly 20 percent of the general population and 34 percent of asthmatics report headaches, breathing difficulties, or other health problems when exposed to air fresheners or deodorizers.

===Misuse and accidental injury===
Air freshener aerosols with certain propellants are susceptible to misuse as an inhalant. Air fresheners have also been used to cause aerosol burn. In rare cases aerosol burns are reported to have been caused by air freshener canisters exploding.

==Alternatives to fragranced air fresheners==
Removing the source of an unpleasant odor will decrease the chance that people will smell it. Ventilation is also important to maintaining indoor air quality and can aid in eliminating unpleasant odors. Simple cleaners such as white vinegar and baking soda, as well as natural adsorbents like activated charcoal and zeolite, are effective at removing odors. Other solutions are adapted to different types of odor. Some house plants may also aid in the removal of toxic substances from the air in building interiors.

<text>Here &amp; Now are an English psychedelic/space rock band formed in early 1974. They have close connections with the band Gong and in 1977/1978 worked with Gong&#x27;s Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth under the name Planet Gong.

==History==

The first version of the group was co-founded in London by drummer/vocalist Keith Dobson, guitarist/keyboardist José Gross, bassist Franco and others in March 1974. By 1975 the line-up featured Dobson/Kif Kif Le Batteur (drums/vocals), Steffe Sharpstrings (guitar), Paul &#x27;Twink&#x27; Noble (synths) and Keith Tha Missile (bass).

In 1977, Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth recruited the band to tour with them under the name Planet Gong, and this combination released a live album &quot;Live Floating Anarchy 1977&quot; and a single &quot;Opium for the People&quot;. The musicians who played on &quot;Live Floating Anarchy 1977&quot; were:
* Steffe Sharpstrings (Stephan Lewry) - guitar
* Keith Tha Missile Bass (Keith Bailey) - bass
* Kif Kif Le Batteur (Keith Dobson) - drums/vocals
* Gavin Da Blitz (Gavin Allardyce) - synths
* Suze Da Blooz (Susan Allport) &amp; Ano Wombat (Ano Graver) - dancing/vocals
* Gilli Smyth - vocals
* Dingbat Alien (Daevid Allen) - guitar/vocals

Kif Kif, Suze and Ano left the band by January 1979; Graver to join Alternative TV, Allport sang with The Androids of Mu, while Dobson fronted the cult 1980s post-punk bands The 012 and World Domination Enterprises. He was replaced initially by Rob Bougie. Here &amp; Now continued into the 1980s around the nucleus of Keith and Gavin, with (following Steffe&#x27;s departure) Dean Gaisburgh-Watkyn on guitar and Paul Rose on drums. Gavin left the band in the early 1990s but, following a &#x27;Planet Gong&#x27; reunion tour, Steffe subsequently rejoined and brought in drummer Steve Cassidy (until 2007). 

Steffe left Here &amp; Now again in 2009. He has continued to work with Steve Cassidy on various fusion projects and contributed to Joie Hinton projects. He is now concentrating on solo work and his long-time involvement in Visitation Arena with Cher Newsam.

Here &amp; Now continues to tour as a loose collective under the leadership of Keith Tha Bass. As of 2024, a new studio album is partially recorded. The current line-up is:
Keith The Bass - Bass/Vocals
Mark Robson - Keyboards/Vocals
Tom Ashurst - Guitar/Vocals
Steve Cassidy - Drums

<text>Alan Tower Waterman (June 4, 1892 – November 30, 1967) was an American physicist.

==Biography==
Born in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, he grew up in Northampton, Massachusetts. His father was a professor of physics at Smith College. Alan also became a physicist, doing his undergraduate and doctoral work at Princeton University from which he obtained his Ph.D. in 1916.

He joined the faculty of the University of Cincinnati, and married Vassar graduate Mary Mallon. (sister of H. Neil Mallon) there in August 1917. He later became a professor at Yale University, and moved to North Haven, Connecticut in 1929. During World War II, he took leave of absence from Yale to become director of field operations for the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the family moved to Cambridge, MA. He continued his government work and became deputy chief of the Office of Naval Research. In 1950, he was appointed by President Truman as first director of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Waterman was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1960. He served as director until 1963, when he retired and was subsequently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Alan and Mary had six children: Alan Jr, an atmospheric physicist who taught at Stanford University, Neil, Barbara, Anne, and Guy, writer, climber, and conservationist. A daughter Mary died in childhood.

Possessed of a gentle nature, Alan Waterman was known for his calm and reasoned point of view. He believed in public service. Besides his scientific talents, he was an accomplished musician, revealing his sense of humor by walking the corridors of the National Science Foundation playing his bagpipes. He had a fine voice and singing together was a family ritual. An avid outdoorsman, Dr. Waterman canoed the rivers and lakes of northern Maine during extensive summer trips in the 1930s and 1940s. He was accompanied by his sons and colleagues, in particular Karl Compton, then president of MIT. Dr. Waterman was known to say that becoming a licensed Maine Guide meant possibly more to him than his NSF appointment.

In 1961, he was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. Honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.

The crater Waterman on the Moon is named after him, as is Mount Waterman in the Hughes Range of Antarctica. Since 1975, the National Science Foundation has annually issued the Alan T. Waterman Award (named in Waterman&#x27;s honor) to a promising young researcher.

Waterman died on November 30, 1967.

== Tributes ==
A month later after his death, President Lyndon B. Johnson made a statement to commemorate him.

Leland John Haworth also paid his respects in his statement:

<text>William Augustus Bird (1888–1963) was an American journalist, now remembered for his Three Mountains Press, a small press he ran while in Paris in the 1920s for the Consolidated Press Association. Taken over by Nancy Cunard in 1928, it became the Hours Press, and continued its association with many of the most important modernists; Ezra Pound had a position as editor for Three Mountains from 1923.

Bill Bird, as he was usually known, was born in Buffalo, New York. He was educated at Trinity College, Hartford. With David Lawrence he founded Consolidated Press Association in 1920; it lasted until 1933.

He started Three Mountains Press in 1922, producing books himself by a slow process of hand printing (the mountains appeared on the colophon). An early work was his own &quot;A Practical Guide to French Wines&quot; (1922). It was based at 29, quai d&#x27;Anjou, where he later provided office accommodation to Ford Madox Ford for the &quot;Transatlantic Review&quot;. It was through Ernest Hemingway that Bird contacted Pound.

In the period to 1925 the Press published works including Pound&#x27;s &quot;A Draft of XVI Cantos&quot;, Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;in our time&quot;, William Carlos Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;, and &quot;Distinguished Air&quot; by Robert McAlmon. On the business side there was a close involvement with McAlmon&#x27;s Contact Editions. Bird&#x27;s interest then dropped, and he sold the printing press, Caslon type and goodwill to Nancy Cunard, supervising the move to her Normandy farmhouse.

His career as journalist outlasted the CPA: he next worked for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, remaining in Paris until 1940. He moved at that point to Spain.

After World War II he was in Tangier, where he edited the &quot;Tangier Gazette&quot; English-language newspaper until it was closed in 1960.

<text>Nigel Francis Quashie ( ; born 20 July 1978) is a Scottish footballer who played more than 300 games as a midfielder in the Football League. He also spent four seasons playing in Iceland. He represented his native England at under-21 and &#x27;B&#x27; international level before switching allegiance to Scotland, the country of his grandfather. Between 2004 and 2006, he played at full international level on 14 occasions, and became the first non-white player to score for the Scotland senior team.

==Personal life==
Quashie was born in the London Borough of Southwark to a Ghanaian father and an English mother. He and his former wife, Joanna, had a son, who died shortly after birth, and a daughter. He and his partner, Kerry Clarke, have a son, Brayden Clarke, who as of 2024 is a youth footballer for Arsenal and for Wales, for which he qualifies through his mother&#x27;s parentage.

==Club career==

===Queens Park Rangers===
He began his career in London as a trainee with Queens Park Rangers in August 1995, making his League debut in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 30 December. He was used sparingly for the remainder of that campaign, making eleven appearances as QPR were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 1995–96 season. He made a further 14 appearances in the 1996–97 season before breaking into the first eleven on a regular basis in the 1997–98 season when he made 35 league and cup appearances.

===Nottingham Forest===
Quashie joined Nottingham Forest for £2.5 million at the start of the 1998–99 FA Premier League season but made only 16 league appearances as Forest finished bottom of the table. He settled into the team in the 1999–2000 season, making 34 appearances, but the death of his son had a major impact on his ability to perform, and he was transfer-listed by manager David Platt at the end of a season in which Forest finished well short of the promotion places. By July, he reportedly had attracted interest from several clubs, including West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City with Portsmouth understood to have made an offer.

===Portsmouth===
Quashie joined Portsmouth in August 2000 for a fee worth up to £600,000, signing a three-year contract. He quickly established himself in the first team, making 37 league and cup appearances in the 2001–02 season as Portsmouth finished in the lower half of the First Division. He made a further 44 appearances in the 2002–03 season and was club vice-captain when Portsmouth won the First Division championship and were promoted to the Premier League. No sooner had Quashie returned from several weeks out with a knee injury in December 2003 than he twisted his other knee leading him to miss a further seven weeks of the 2003–04 season. He remained a first-choice player, making 25 appearances (21 starts) in all competition as Portsmouth claimed 13th place in the Premier League. Although a regular starter in first half of the 2004–05 season as well as captain, he had not been offered a new deal despite being out of contract at the end of the season and joined former Portsmouth manager, Harry Redknapp, at Southampton during the January 2005 transfer window.

===Southampton===
Quashie joined Southampton for a fee of £2.1 million in January 2005, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s a big move for me and I am happy to be linking up with Harry Redknapp again. I am certain we will stay upI would not have come here if I had any doubts about that, but we need to get a few results quickly.&quot; The chairman of Southampton, Rupert Lowe, said, &quot;Harry really wanted Nigelhe thinks he is a strong character who will add to the dressing room. We are delighted to make him our third signing since Harry arrived.&quot; A training ground injury prevented Quashie from making his debut against Liverpool on 22 January 2005 and he did not appear until the match against Everton on 6 February.

After the transfer of Jason Dodd, he became the club&#x27;s captain but he was unable to prevent the Saints being relegated at the end of the 2004–05 season. Despite relegation, Quashie said that he had no regrets over the move to Southampton as he had been unhappy with the way he had been treated at Portsmouth. However, following Redknapp&#x27;s departure and his replacement with George Burley, Quashie was allowed to leave Southampton in the January 2006 transfer window.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Quashie joined West Bromwich Albion in January 2006 for £1.2 million, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Manager Bryan Robson, &quot;I always liked Nigel when he played for QPR, Portsmouth and Southampton. He is intelligent, has good stamina and is a very good passer of the ball. He has got the experience now of relegation fights and playing in the Premiership. I just feel he will improve our squad.&quot; He made his debut for Albion in a 2–0 Premier League win over Blackburn Rovers on 4 February 2006. He was charged with misconduct by the Football Association after being sent off against Middlesbrough three weeks later for alleged use of foul and abusive language towards the referee&#x27;s assistants as he left the pitch and was given a one-game ban in addition to a four-game ban for the sending off, his second of the season, and a £5,000 fine after admitting misconduct. His only goal for the club came in a 3–1 defeat against Arsenal in April 2006. When Albion were relegated at the end of the season, Quashie achieved the rare distinction of two successive relegations from the Premiership. He was allowed to leave in the January 2007 transfer window as he expressed a wish to return to the Premier League and manager Tony Mowbray wanted to raise some revenue to bring in new players.

===West Ham United===
Quashie became Alan Curbishley&#x27;s second signing of the transfer window when he joined West Ham United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an initial fee of £1.5 million, rising to £1.75 million when West Ham avoided relegation from the 2006–07 Premier League. Curbishley explained that he had signed Quashie &quot;because he is an experienced player who will add competition to our central midfield positions ... The competition for places is a factor that will be important to us as we fight to move up the table&quot;. Quashie made his debut against Fulham a few days later and went on to make eight appearances, none of them on the winning side, as West Ham battled against relegation.

A persistent foot injury meant that Quashie did not play a single competitive match during the 2007–08 season. He made his comeback in a pre-season friendly against Queens Park Rangers in August 2008. The signing of Swiss international Valon Behrami in the summer of 2008 and the emergence of academy graduates Jack Collison and Junior Stanislas meant that competition for midfield places was much stiffer, and Quashie spent much of the next 18 months out on loan.

====Birmingham City====
Quashie trained with Birmingham City of the Championship for several weeks to regain fitness before signing on loan, initially for a month, on 22 October 2008. He went straight into the squad for that day&#x27;s match against Crystal Palace and made his debut as a second-half substitute. Despite missing the last game of his initial loan spell through suspension, having been sent off in the match against Charlton Athletic, the loan was extended for a further month, and again for a third and final month, until 17 January 2009. Quashie returned to West Ham on 19 January, having played 11 times for Birmingham.

====Wolverhampton Wanderers====
Quashie joined Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2009 on loan until the end of the season. He made three appearances for the team and was praised by manager Mick McCarthy for his leadership before quickly dropping out of contention as the club won promotion to the Premier League as champions.

====Milton Keynes Dons====
In November 2009, Quashie joined League One club Milton Keynes Dons on loan until 3 January 2010. He made a losing start to his MK Dons career, coming on in the first half for Luke Howell in the 4–3 home defeat to Carlisle United on 24 November. Quashie scored his first goal for MK Dons on 12 December in a 2–1 away win against Leyton Orient, and finished his loan spell with two goals from eight games.

===Return to Queens Park Rangers===
On 22 January 2010, Quashie was released by West Ham to return to his first professional club, Queens Park Rangers, on a free transfer. He said &quot;It&#x27;s great to be back home, and I am delighted to be at a club that I love to pieces&quot;. He made his second QPR debut in the 5–0 defeat at one of his former clubs, Nottingham Forest, and played just four times before being released at the end of the season.

===Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur===
On 13 April 2012, Quashie joined 1. deild karla club Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur on a two-year contract as both a player and as assistant manager to Andri Marteinsson. He is also a coach in the ÍR academy. Quashie made his league debut for ÍR on 12 May 2012 and scored the team&#x27;s second goal in the 3–2 win against KA. Following the dismissal of Andri Marteinsson on 21 August with ÍR at the bottom of the division, Quashie was appointed to take charge of the team until the end of the season.

===BÍ/Bolungarvík===
In January 2013, Quashie signed a three-year contract with 1. deild karla club BÍ/Bolungarvík. He also served as assistant coach in all three seasons. He retired from playing football following the 2015 season.

==International career==

===England===
Quashie played once for the England under-18 team in a European championship qualifier against Latvia in November 1995. He was a member of several England under-21 squads during the 1996–97 season before making his debut at that level on 30 May 1997 in the starting eleven for a European championship qualifier against Poland in Chorzów. The game ended as a 1–1 draw, and Quashie played in one more qualifier as England went on to top their group, but still faced a play-off against the other worst-ranked group winner, Greece. Quashie started the away leg, which England lost 2–0, but did not take the field in the home leg, which England won 4–2 on the night but lost on the away goals rule. He was selected for the England B team to face Chile in February 1998, a 2–1 defeat, but was injured after half an hour. His fourth and last under-21 appearance came a few weeks later in a friendly away to Switzerland.

===Scotland===
FIFA eligibility rules changed in 2004 to permit players to change their international allegiance. Quashie expressed interest in representing Scotland. He qualified because his maternal grandfather was born in Glasgowa fact Quashie had to prove.

Quashie&#x27;s Scotland debut was a 1–0 friendly win away against Estonia on 27 May 2004. He was only the second black player to represent Scotland (after Andrew Watson in 1881) and the third non-white man (after Paul Wilson in 1975). Quashie scored on his second appearance three days later, side footing home in the 34th minute to put his team 4-0 ahead v Trinidad and Tobago at Easter Road, Edinburgh. In doing so he became the first non-white player to score for the Scotland Men&#x27;s National team. The Scots won 4-1. According to Scotland manager Berti Vogts, &quot;Nigel is a fantastic player and a real leader on the pitch. He feels so Scottish and that&#x27;s great.&quot; In total Quashie made 14 appearances for Scotland between 2004 and 2006, scoring once.

<doc id="1083009" wikidata="Q233216" url="?curid=1083009" title="Emily VanCamp">
<text>Emily Irene VanCamp (; born May 12, 1986) is a Canadian actress. She gained acclaim and international recognition for portraying the lead role of Emily Thorne on the ABC series &quot;Revenge&quot; (2011–2015). She also starred on the Fox medical drama series &quot;The Resident&quot; (2018–2021).

She has appeared in various films including &quot;Black Irish&quot; (2007), &quot;Carriers&quot; (2009), &quot;Norman&quot; (2010), &quot;The Girl in the Book&quot; (2015), and &quot;Boundaries&quot; (2016), as well as various television shows including &quot;Everwood&quot; (2002–2006), &quot;Glory Days&quot; (2002), and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2007–2010). She portrays Sharon Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), first appearing in the film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
VanCamp was born on May 12, 1986, in Port Perry, Ontario. Her father, Robert VanCamp, is an animal nutritionist, and her first job was working for him, delivering food to clients in and around her hometown. VanCamp started to dance at age three. At age 11, she wanted to become a professional dancer and convinced her parents to let her attend a summer training program in Montreal. When she was 12, she was accepted to the École supérieure de ballet du Québec, the training program of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and moved in with a French-Canadian family.

==Career==
===1998–2002: Career beginnings===
In 1998, VanCamp became interested in acting after visiting her sister Katie on the set of the film &quot;Ladies Room&quot;. She started taking acting classes on Saturday afternoons, found an agent, and worked on a few commercials. She then was cast in the second part of a special three-part episode of the Canadian children&#x27;s horror anthology television series &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; called &quot;The Silver Sight&quot;, in which she played opposite a 17-year-old Elisha Cuthbert. VanCamp&#x27;s character was present in one scene and did not speak any dialogue.

VanCamp followed this with a role as a teenage Jackie Bouvier in the Emmy-nominated CBS TV movie &quot;Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis&quot; and a guest spot on the YTV sitcom &quot;Radio Active&quot;. The following year saw the release of her first theatrical film, the lesbian-themed drama &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot;, in which she played a supporting role as Jessica Paré&#x27;s sister, and another television guest spot in an episode of the short-lived medical horror series &quot;All Souls&quot;, where she played a hit-and-run victim with spinal trauma. VanCamp also had roles in the miniseries &quot;Dice&quot;, directed by Rachel Talalay, and in the TV film &quot;Redeemer&quot;, directed by Graeme Clifford, which aired in early 2002.

===2003–2010: Breakthrough and television work===
VanCamp&#x27;s breakthrough came at age 15 when she was cast as Sam Dolan, a series regular role, in the WB mid-season show &quot;Glory Days&quot; (known in Europe as &quot;Demontown&quot;), the third TV series from &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; creator Kevin Williamson. The horror mystery received mildly positive reviews, but was a ratings disappointment and was cancelled after nine episodes. VanCamp&#x27;s performance as the lead character&#x27;s younger sister caught the eye of former &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; writer Greg Berlanti. Her performance reminded him of Katie Holmes, and he &quot;desperately wanted to work with her&quot;. He cast her in his forthcoming first show, &quot;Everwood&quot;, also for the WB. VanCamp played Amy, Dr. Abbott&#x27;s daughter, who immediately forms a friendship with Dr. Brown&#x27;s son Ephram, played by Gregory Smith. A significant portion of the show was devoted to the relationships between the two families, and in particular to Amy and Ephram. She gained a certain amount of recognition for the role, in which her character was confronted with drugs, depression, and an alienation from her family, receiving four Teen Choice Awards nominations and one Young Artist Awards nomination during the course of the show&#x27;s run.

While on breaks from &quot;Everwood&quot;, VanCamp starred in a few film projects, including the thrillers &quot;No Good Deed&quot; and &quot;A Different Loyalty&quot;, as well as &quot;Rings&quot;, a horror short film that bridges the events between &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Ring Two&quot;, and ties directly into her appearance in the opening scene of the second film.

VanCamp filmed the post-apocalyptic horror film &quot;Carriers&quot; in the summer of 2006, which was not released until 2009. Early 2007 had the broadcast of a season-eight &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode, in which her drug-addict character Charlotte Truex cannot recall her actions on the night her mother was murdered, and the premiere of the independent drama &quot;Black Irish&quot;, where her character Kathleen McKay, the sister of lead actor Michael Angarano&#x27;s character Cole, has to deal with teenage pregnancy.

VanCamp&#x27;s next big role came at age 20 when &quot;Everwood&quot; creator Greg Berlanti cast her as a regular midway into the first season of the ABC drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, which he was showrunning, offering her the part directly. The Jon Robin Baitz–created series chronicles the lives of the Walkers, a wealthy family who owns a food company. After their patriarch dies, it is revealed he has a secret child from a long-standing affair. Initially, it was believed that Rebecca Harper, played by VanCamp, is the secret child, but this was proven otherwise later in the series.

VanCamp remained a regular on &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; during the show&#x27;s first four seasons and returned as a guest for a few episodes in the fifth and final season to wrap up her character&#x27;s storyline. While working on the show, she found the time to star in the independent drama &quot;Norman&quot; in mid-2008, which earned her awards from the San Diego Film Festival and the Breckenridge Festival of Film, her only wins to date. The film has her playing the girlfriend of main character Norman Long, played by Dan Byrd, who pretends he is dying of cancer. VanCamp also starred in the two-part TV film &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, the latest adaptation of Lew Wallace&#x27;s 1880 novel, in which she played Ben-Hur&#x27;s wife Esther.

===2011–present: &quot;Revenge&quot; and other projects===
VanCamp starred in &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; film &quot;Beyond the Blackboard&quot;, based on the true story of Stacey Bess, whom VanCamp plays. The film aired on CBS on April 24, 2011. She was then cast as Amanda Clarke / Emily Thorne in the ABC drama &quot;Revenge&quot;, which was given a series order in May 2011. As the first TV show VanCamp truly headlined, &quot;Revenge&quot; gave her a significant amount of recognition, including multiple Teen Choice Awards nominations.

VanCamp co-starred in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; as Sharon Carter, a potential loyal friend of Chris Evans&#x27; titular hero and the great-niece of Peggy Carter, played by Hayley Atwell. The film was shot from April through June 2013 and was released on April 4, 2014. VanCamp reprised her role in the 2016 sequel &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, the 2021 Disney+ series &quot;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&quot;, and the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;

VanCamp starred in the independent drama &quot;The Girl in the Book&quot;, which started filming in mid-June 2013 in New York City. Based on a true story, the film centers on VanCamp&#x27;s character Alice, a 28-year-old assistant book editor and aspiring writer. To fund its post-production, the film&#x27;s producers launched a crowdfunding Kickstarter campaign on June 17, 2013, which successfully surpassed its $65,000 goal on July 1.

In 2016, she starred in the French-Canadian independent drama &quot;Boundaries&quot;, also known as &quot;Pays&quot; in French, which was her first bilingual role where she spoke in fluent French.

In March 2017, VanCamp was cast as nurse practitioner Nic Nevin, the female lead in the Fox medical drama &quot;The Resident&quot;, whose character has a complicated romantic history and relationship with the main character Conrad Hawkins, played by Matt Czuchry. In May 2017, Fox ordered the pilot to series. In 2021, VanCamp left &quot;The Resident&quot; after four seasons, although she did return for the fifth-season finale.

==Personal life==
VanCamp has three sisters. She speaks French fluently and &quot;feels at home&quot; when she hears the language. She is also an accomplished dancer who studied and trained in ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and tap as a child, which she credits with helping her through her fight scenes on &quot;Revenge&quot;. She believes that if she had not gone into acting, she would have probably either continued dancing or done something related to cooking.

VanCamp began dating English actor and &quot;Revenge&quot; co-star Josh Bowman in late 2011. On May 11, 2017, the couple announced they were engaged, and married on December 15, 2018, in the Bahamas. In 2021, VanCamp announced the birth of their first child, a daughter, on her Instagram account. In 2024, VanCamp gave birth to her second daughter. VanCamp is also an equal pay supporter, and is involved in charitable efforts to help endangered tigers.

<doc id="1083014" wikidata="Q33596" url="?curid=1083014" title="Motility">
<text>Motility is the ability of an organism to move independently using metabolic energy. This biological concept encompasses movement at various levels, from whole organisms to cells and subcellular components. 

Motility is observed in animals, microorganisms, and even some plant structures, playing crucial roles in activities such as foraging, reproduction, and cellular functions. It is genetically determined but can be influenced by environmental factors. 

In multicellular organisms, motility is facilitated by systems like the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, while at the cellular level, it involves mechanisms such as amoeboid movement and flagellar propulsion. These cellular movements can be directed by external stimuli, a phenomenon known as taxis. Examples include chemotaxis (movement along chemical gradients) and phototaxis (movement in response to light).

Motility also includes physiological processes like gastrointestinal movements and peristalsis. Understanding motility is important in biology, medicine, and ecology, as it impacts processes ranging from bacterial behavior to ecosystem dynamics.

==Definitions==

Motility, the ability of an organism to move independently, using metabolic energy, can be contrasted with sessility, the state of organisms that do not possess a means of self-locomotion and are normally immobile. 
Motility differs from mobility, the ability of an object to be moved.

The term vagility means a lifeform that can be moved but only passively; sessile organisms including plants and fungi often have vagile parts such as fruits, seeds, or spores which may be dispersed by other agents such as wind, water, or other organisms.

Motility is genetically determined, but may be affected by environmental factors such as toxins. The nervous system and musculoskeletal system provide the majority of mammalian motility.

In addition to animal locomotion, most animals are motile, though some are vagile, described as having passive locomotion. Many bacteria and other microorganisms, including even some viruses, and multicellular organisms are motile; some mechanisms of fluid flow in multicellular organs and tissue are also considered instances of motility, as with gastrointestinal motility. Motile marine animals are commonly called free-swimming, and motile non-parasitic organisms are called free-living.

Motility includes an organism&#x27;s ability to move food through its digestive tract. There are two types of intestinal motility – peristalsis and segmentation. This motility is brought about by the contraction of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract which mix the luminal contents with various secretions (segmentation) and move contents through the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus (peristalsis).

==Cellular level ==

At the cellular level, different modes of movement exist:

* amoeboid movement, a crawling-like movement, which also makes swimming possible
* filopodia, enabling movement of the axonal growth cone
* flagellar motility, a swimming-like motion (observed for example in spermatozoa, propelled by the regular beat of their flagellum, or the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacterium, which swims by rotating a helical prokaryotic flagellum)
* gliding motility
* swarming motility
* twitching motility, a form of motility used by bacteria to crawl over surfaces using grappling hook-like filaments called type IV pili.

Many cells are not motile, for example &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Shigella&quot;, or under specific circumstances such as &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; at 37 °C.

==Movements==
Events perceived as movements can be directed:
* along a chemical gradient (see chemotaxis)
* along a temperature gradient (see thermotaxis)
* along a light gradient (see phototaxis)
* along a magnetic field line (see magnetotaxis)
* along an electric field (see galvanotaxis)
* along the direction of the gravitational force (see gravitaxis)
* along a rigidity gradient (see durotaxis)
* along a gradient of cell adhesion sites (see haptotaxis)
* along other cells or biopolymers

==See also==
* Cell migration

<doc id="1083018" wikidata="Q42298246" url="?curid=1083018" title="Monarchy of Cambodia">
<text>The monarchy of Cambodia is the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The king of Cambodia () is the head of state and head of the ruling Royal House of Norodom. In the contemporary period, the king&#x27;s power has been limited to that of a symbolic figurehead. The monarchy had been in existence since at least 50 AD except during its abolition from 1970 to 1993. Since 1993, the king of Cambodia has been an elected monarch, making Cambodia one of the few elective monarchies of the world. The king is elected for life by the Royal Council of the Throne, which consists of several senior political and religious figures. Candidates are chosen from among male descendants of King Ang Duong who are at least 30 years old, from the two royal houses of Cambodia (the House of Norodom and the House of Sisowath).

==Role==
Cambodia&#x27;s constitution, promulgated in 1993, stipulated the king&#x27;s role as a mainly ceremonial one. It declared that the king &quot;shall reign, but not govern&quot; as well as being the &quot;symbol of national unity and continuity&quot;. 
The king performs important functions of state as required by the constitution. This includes but is not limited to:
*Appointing the prime minister and the Cabinet.
*Convening over the opening of the two legislative bodies, the National Assembly of Cambodia and the Senate of Cambodia.
*Serving as the supreme commander of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
*Meeting with the prime minister on a semi-monthly basis in which the king is briefed on matters of state.
*Signing the royal code/decree that gives effect to laws enacted by the legislature and proposals by the cabinet.
*Acting as &quot;supreme arbiter&quot; to enable the functioning of state institutions.
*Receiving credentials from ambassadors.
*Possessing the power of commutation and pardon.
*Presiding over the Supreme Council of the Magistracy.
*Appointing a fixed number of members to serve on state institutions such as the Senate and the Constitutional Council.
*Awarding of national honours.

The king also fulfils other roles not explicitly mentioned in the constitution in his capacity as head of state, for example, presiding over events of national significance including religious ceremonies and traditions integral to the Khmer nation, supporting humanitarian and philanthropic causes, and representing Cambodia abroad when undertaking official visits overseas.

<doc id="1083021" wikidata="Q76918" url="?curid=1083021" title="Johann Georg Faust">
<text>Georg Faustus (sometimes also Georg [[Marcantonio Sabellico|Sebellicus]] Faustus(; c. 1480 or 1466 – c. 1541), known in English as John Faustus, was a German itinerant alchemist, astrologer, and magician of the German Renaissance. He was often called a conman and a heretic by the people of medieval Europe.

&quot;Doctor Faust&quot; became the subject of folk legend in the years soon after his death, transmitted in chapbooks beginning in the 1580s, and was notably adapted by Christopher Marlowe as a tragic heretic in his play &quot;The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus&quot; (1588-1592). The &quot;Faustbuch&quot; tradition survived throughout the early modern period, and the legend was again adapted in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Faust&quot; (1808), Hector Berlioz&#x27;s musical composition &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; (premiered 1846), and Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot; of 1857.

==Historical Faust==
Because of his early treatment as a figure in legend and literature, it is difficult to establish historical facts about his life with any certainty. In the 17th century, it was even doubted that there ever had been a historical Faust, and the legendary character was identified with a printer of Mainz called &quot;Johann Fust&quot;. Johann Georg Neumann in 1683 addressed the question in his &quot;Disquisitio historica de Fausto praestigiatore&quot;, establishing Faust&#x27;s historical existence based on contemporary references.

In the light of records of an activity spanning more than 30 years, the two suggested birth years (1466 vs. 1480/1), the two recorded first names (Georg vs. Johann) and the two recorded places of origin (Knittlingen vs. Heidelberg/Helmstett), it has been suggested that there were two itinerant magicians calling themselves &quot;Faustus&quot;, one Georg, active ca. 1505 to 1515, and another Johann, active in the 1530s.

Possible places of origin of the historical Johann Faust are Knittlingen (Manlius 1562), Helmstadt near Heidelberg, or Roda. Knittlingen today has an archive and a museum dedicated to Faust. Baron (1978) and Ruickbie (2009) argue for Helmstadt as his place of birth.

Faust&#x27;s year of birth is given either as 1480/1 or as 1466. Baron (1992) and Ruickbie prefer the latter. The city archive of Ingolstadt has a letter dated 27 June 1528 which mentions a &quot;Doctor Jörg Faustus von Haidlberg&quot;. Other sources have &quot;Georgius Faustus Helmstet(ensis)&quot;. Baron, searching for students from Helmstet in the archives of Heidelberg University, found records of a &quot;Georgius Helmstetter&quot; inscribed from 1483 to 1487, stating that he was promoted to baccalaureus on 12 July 1484 and to magister artium on 1 March 1487.

For the year 1506, there is a record of Faust appearing as performer of magical tricks and horoscopes in Gelnhausen. Over the following 30 years, there are numerous similar records spread over southern Germany. Faust appeared as physician, doctor of philosophy, alchemist, magician and astrologer, and was often accused as a fraud. The church denounced him as a blasphemer in league with the devil. Faust had also supposedly joined Protestantism.

Johannes Trithemius in a letter to Johannes Virdung dated 20 August 1507 warns the latter of a certain &quot;Georgius Sabellicus&quot;, a trickster and fraud styling himself &quot;Georgius Sabellicus, Faustus junior, fons necromanticorum, astrologus, magus secundus etc.&quot; According to Trithemius, in Gelnhausen and Würzburg, Sabellicus boasted blasphemously of his powers, even claiming that he could easily reproduce all the miracles of Christ. Trithemius alleges that Sabellicus received a teaching position in Sickingen in 1507, which he abused by indulging in sodomy with his male students, evading punishment by a timely escape.

Conrad Mutianus Rufus in 1513 recounts a meeting with a &quot;chiromanticus&quot; called &quot;Georgius Faustus, Helmitheus Heidelbergensis&quot; (likely for &quot;hemitheus&quot;, &quot;demigod of Heidelberg&quot;), overhearing his vain and foolish boasts in an Erfurt inn.

On 23 February 1520, Faust was in Bamberg, doing a horoscope for the bishop and the town, for which he received the sum of 10 gulden.

In 1528, Faust visited Ingolstadt, whence he was banished shortly after. In 1532 he seems to have tried to enter Nürnberg, according to an unflattering note made by the junior mayor of the city to &quot;deny free passage to the great nigromancer and sodomite Doctor Faustus&quot; (&quot;Doctor Faustus, dem großen Sodomiten und Nigromantico in furt glait ablainen&quot;). Later records give a more positive verdict; thus the Tübingen professor Joachim Camerarius in 1536 recognises Faust as a respectable astrologer, and physician Philipp Begardi of Worms in 1539 praises his medical knowledge. The last direct attestation of Faust dates to 25 June 1535, when his presence was recorded in Münster during the Anabaptist rebellion.

Faust&#x27;s death is dated to 1540 or 1541. He allegedly died in an explosion of an alchemical experiment in the &quot;Hotel zum Löwen&quot; in Staufen im Breisgau. His body is reported to have been found in a &quot;grievously mutilated&quot; state which was interpreted to the effect that the devil had come to collect him in person by his clerical and scholarly enemies. In 1548, the theologian Johann Gast in his &quot;sermones conviviales&quot; states that Faust had suffered a dreadful death, and would keep turning his face to the earth in spite of the body being turned on its back several times. In his 1548 account, Gast also mentions a personal meeting with Faust in Basel during which Faust provided the cook with poultry of a strange kind. According to Gast, Faust travelled with a dog and a horse, and there were rumours that the dog would sometimes transform into a servant.

Another posthumous account is that of Johannes Manlius, drawing on notes by Melanchthon, in his &quot;Locorum communium collectanea&quot; dating to 1562. According to Manlius, &quot;Johannes Faustus&quot; was a personal acquaintance of Melanchthon&#x27;s and had studied in Kraków. Manlius&#x27; account is already suffused with legendary elements, and cannot be taken at face value as a historical source. Manlius recounts that Faust had boasted that the victories of the German emperor in Italy were due to his magical intervention. In Venice, he allegedly attempted to fly, but was thrown to the ground by the devil. Johannes Wier in &quot;de prestigiis daemonum&quot; (1568) recounts that Faustus had been arrested in Batenburg because he had recommended that the local chaplain called Dorstenius should use arsenic to get rid of his stubble. Dorstenius smeared his face with the poison, upon which he lost not only his beard but also much of his skin, an anecdote Wier says he heard from the victim himself. in 1602 still claims to have heard tales of Faust directly from people who had met him in person, but from the publication of the 1587 &quot;Faustbuch&quot;, it becomes impossible to separate historical anecdotes from rumour and legend.

The town of Bad Kreuznach has a &quot;Faust Haus&quot; restaurant reportedly built in 1492 on the site of &quot;the home of the legendary Magister Johann Georg Sabellicus Faust&quot;.

===Ascribed works===

There are several prints of grimoires or magical texts attributed to Faust. Some of them are artificially dated to his lifetime, either to &quot;1540&quot;, or to &quot;1501&quot;, &quot;1510&quot;, etc., some even to unreasonably early dates, such as &quot;1405&quot; and &quot;1469&quot;. The prints in fact date to the late 16th century, from ca. 1580, i.e. the same period of the development of the &quot;Volksbuch&quot; tradition. The &quot;Höllenzwang&quot; text is also extant in manuscript versions from the late 16th century. A manuscript of c. 1700 under the title &quot;Doctoris Johannis Fausti Morenstern practicirter Höllenzwang genant Der schwarze Mohr. Ann(o) MCCCCVII&quot; (i.e. &quot;1407&quot;) includes the text which in print is known as &quot;Dr. Faustens sogenannter schwartzer Mohren-Stern, gedruckt zu London 1510&quot;. Variants of the &quot;Höllenzwang&quot; attributed to Faust continued to be published for the next 200 years, well into the 18th century.

==Faust in legend and literature==

The &quot;Historia von D. Johann Fausten&quot; printed by Johann Spies 1587, a German chapbook about Faust&#x27;s sins, is at the beginning of the literary tradition of the Faust character. It was translated into English in 1587, where it came to the attention of Christopher Marlowe. Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; of 1589 portrays Faust as the archetypical adept of Renaissance magic. In the 17th century, Marlowe&#x27;s work was re-introduced to Germany in the form of popular plays, which over time reduced Faust to a merely comical figure for popular amusement. Meanwhile, the chapbook of Spies was edited and excerpted by G. R. Widmann and Nikolaus Pfitzer, and was finally re-published anonymously in modernised form in the early 18th century, as the &quot;Faustbuch des Christlich Meynenden&quot;. This edition became widely known and was also read by Goethe in his youth. As summarized by Richard Stecher, this version is the account of a young man called &quot;Johann Faust&quot;, son of a peasant, who studies theology in Wittenberg, besides medicine, astrology and &quot;other magical arts&quot;. His boundless desire for knowledge leads him to conjure the devil in a wood near Wittenberg, who appears in the shape of a greyfriar who calls himself &quot;Mephistopheles&quot;.

Faust enters a pact with the devil, pledging his soul in exchange for 24 years of service. The devil produces a &quot;Christoph Wagner&quot; and a poodle &quot;Prästigiar&quot; to accompany Faust in his adventure. Faust goes on to live a life of pleasures. In Leipzig, he rides out of Auerbachs Keller on a barrel. In Erfurt he taps wine from a table. He visits the Pope in Rome, the Sultan in Constantinople and the Kaiser in Innsbruck. After 16 years, he begins to regret his pact and wants to withdraw, but the devil persuades him to renew it, conjuring up Helen of Troy, with whom Faust sires a son called Justus. As the 24 years come to an end, &quot;Satan, chief of devils&quot; appears and announces Faust&#x27;s death for the coming night. Faust at a &quot;last supper&quot; scene in Rimlich takes leave of his friends and admonishes them to repentance and piety. At midnight, there is a great noise from Faust&#x27;s room, and in the morning, its walls and floors are found splattered with blood and brains, with Faust&#x27;s eyes lying on the floor and his dead body in the courtyard.

<text>Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane (20 June 1920 – 3 February 1969) was a Mozambican revolutionary and anthropologist who was the founder of the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO). He served as the FRELIMO&#x27;s first leader until his assassination in 1969 in Tanzania. An anthropologist by profession, Mondlane also worked as a history and sociology professor at Syracuse University before returning to Mozambique in 1963.

==Early life==
The fourth of 16 sons of a chief of the Bantu-speaking Tsonga, Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane was born in N&#x27;wajahani, district of Mandlakazi in the province of Gaza, in Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique) in 1920. He worked as a shepherd until the age of 12.

He attended several different primary schools before enrolling in a Swiss–Presbyterian school near Manjacaze. He ended his secondary education in the same organisation&#x27;s church school at Lemana College at Village above Elim Hospital in the Transvaal (Limpopo Province), South Africa. He then spent one year at the Jan H. Hofmeyr School of Social Work before enrolling in Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg but was expelled from South Africa after only a year, in 1949, following the rise of the Apartheid government.

In June 1950, Mondlane attended the University of Lisbon, in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. On Mondlane&#x27;s request, he was transferred to the United States, where he attended Oberlin College in Ohio at the age of 31, under a Phelps Stokes scholarship. Mondlane enrolled at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, in 1951, starting as a junior, and in 1953 he obtained a degree in anthropology and sociology. He continued his studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Mondlane earned an MA (1955), and then a PhD (1960) under the supervision of Melville J. Herskovits on the subject of &quot;Role conflict, reference group, and race&quot;.

In 1956, he married Janet Rae Johnson, a white American woman from Indiana whom he met at a Methodist Youth conference.&quot;

==Anthropology career==
Mondlane began working in 1957 as research officer in the Trusteeship Department of the United Nations which enabled him to travel to Africa and work on a PhD dissertation at Northwestern University. His dissertation, under Herskovits&#x27; supervision, focused on the &quot;liberal&quot; tradition of Franz Boas.

He concluded his PhD in 1960 and resigned from his United Nations position in 1961 to be allowed to participate in political activism. He took up a teaching position at Syracuse University that same year where he helped develop the East African Studies Program. In 1963, he resigned from his post at Syracuse to move to Tanzania to engage in the liberation struggle of Frelimo, the presidency of which he won in June 1962.

==Political activism==
After graduation, Eduardo Mondlane became a United Nations official. One of António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s most important advisers, Adriano Moreira, a political science professor who had been appointed to the post of Portugal&#x27;s Minister of the Overseas (&quot;Ministro do Ultramar&quot;), met Mondlane at the United Nations when both were working there and, recognising his qualities, tried to bring him to the Portuguese side by offering to him a post in Portuguese Mozambique&#x27;s administration. However, Mondlane showed little interest in the offer and later joined the Mozambican pro-independence movements in Tanzania, who lacked a credible leader. In 1962 Mondlane was elected president of the newly formed Mozambican Liberation Front (&quot;Frente de Libertação de Moçambique&quot; or FRELIMO), which was composed of elements from smaller independentist groups. In 1963 he settled FRELIMO headquarters outside of Mozambique in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Supported both by several Western countries and the USSR, as well as by many African states, FRELIMO began a guerrilla war in 1964 to obtain Mozambique&#x27;s independence from Portugal. In FRELIMO&#x27;s early years, its leadership was divided: the faction led by Mondlane wanted not merely to fight for independence but also for a change to a socialist society; dos Santos, Machel and Chissano and a majority of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee shared this view. Their opponents, prominent among whom were Nkavandame and Simango, wanted independence, but not a fundamental change in social relations. The socialist position was approved by the Second Party Congress, held in July 1968; Mondlane was re-elected party president, and a strategy of protracted war based on support among the peasantry (as opposed to a quick &quot;coup&quot; attempt) was adopted.

==Death==
In 1969, a book containing a bomb was sent to Mondlane at the FRELIMO Headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It exploded when he opened the package in the house of an American friend, Betty King, killing him. Various parties have been implicated as potentially responsible for his assassination, including rivals within FRELIMO, Tanzanian politicians, the Portuguese secret service, and Aginter Press. Former International and State Defense Police (PIDE) Agent Oscar Cardoso claims that PIDE Agent Casimiro Monteiro planted the bomb that killed Eduardo Mondlane.

==Legacy and homages==
Mondlane&#x27;s death was mourned at a funeral in 1969 which was officiated by his Oberlin classmate and friend the Reverend Edward Hawley, who said during the ceremonies that Mondlane &quot;...laid down his life for the truth that man was made for dignity and self-determination.&quot;

By the early 1970s, FRELIMO&#x27;s 7,000-strong guerrilla force had wrested control of some countryside areas of the central and northern parts of Mozambique from the Portuguese authorities. The independentist guerrilla was engaging a Portuguese force of approximately 60,000 military, which was almost all concentrated in the area of Cahora Bassa where the Portuguese administration was finalising the construction of a major hydroelectric dam, one of many facilities and improvements that the Portuguese provincial administration&#x27;s development commission was rapidly developing since the 1960s. The 1974 overthrow of the Portuguese ruling regime after a leftist military coup in Lisbon brought a dramatic change of direction in Portugal&#x27;s policy regarding its overseas provinces, and on 25 June 1975, Portugal handed over power to FRELIMO and Mozambique became an independent nation.

Mondlane&#x27;s wife Janet Rae Johnson served in various government positions, and his daughter Nyeleti Mondlane became Minister of Youth and Sports and later of Gender, Children and Social Action.

===Eduardo Mondlane University===
In 1975, the &quot;Universidade de Lourenço Marques&quot; founded by the Portuguese and given the name of the capital of Portugal&#x27;s Overseas Province of Mozambique, Lourenço Marques (now Maputo, Mozambique), was renamed &quot;Universidade Eduardo Mondlane&quot;, or Eduardo Mondlane University. It is located in the capital city of independent Mozambique.

<text>Lordi () is a Finnish rock band. Formed in 1992 by the band&#x27;s lead singer, songwriter and costume maker Mr Lordi (Tomi Petteri Putaansuu), Lordi are known for wearing monster masks and using horror elements with pyrotechnics during concerts and music videos. The band rose to fame in 2002 with their hit single &quot;Would You Love a Monsterman?&quot;, and won the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with their song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;.

Lordi has toured and recorded actively since 2002, and Mr Lordi upgrades the band&#x27;s costumes and masks for each album. The band has gone through several line-up changes with Mr Lordi being the only consistent member of the band since their foundation. Members of Lordi have stated their desire for their unmasked faces to remain private. However, they have made a number of unmasked appearances in several news outlets.

==History==

===1992–2002: Formation===
Lordi was formed in 1992 as a solo project by Mr Lordi. Lordi&#x27;s first demo album &quot;Napalm Market&quot; was done in 1993. The album included the song &quot;Inferno&quot;, which also got a music video, all done by Mr Lordi. In the music video, Mr Lordi performed unmasked but he had made monster make-up for his friends who played secondary roles in the video. After the video was done, Mr Lordi got an idea of a band of monsters. &quot;Inferno&quot; was later released in the Finnish &quot;Rockmurskaa&quot; compilation album in 1995. In 1996 Mr Lordi organized a Kiss cruise for Finnish Kiss fans from Finland to Sweden. During the cruise, he met musicians Amen and G-Stealer and told them about his music project called Lordi. After the cruise, they joined the band. One year later Enary joined the band on keyboard and the band recorded their first album, &quot;Bend Over and Pray The Lord&quot;. At the time when the album was recorded, the band didn&#x27;t have a drummer and they used MIDI drum tracks in place of a real drummer.

Ari Tiainen, the owner of their record company, had originally planned to publish the album; however, the company did not have sufficient resources to market it. Tiainen recommended Lordi to the record label Kimmo Hirvonen&#x27;s Records, owned by Anaconda. The album was planned to release in early 1999, but Anaconda Records went bankrupt shortly before the planned release date and the album was never released.

The band never performed with the original line-up, though they had been promised a record release gig in 1999. During the same year, G-Stealer left the band because of work commitments and was replaced by Magnum, whom Mr Lordi had met via Kiss Army Finland. In 2000, drummer Kita joined and the band got their first drummer.

===2002–2006: &quot;Get Heavy&quot;, success in Europe and &quot;The Monsterican Dream&quot;===
After several failed attempts at obtaining a recording contract, Lordi signed a record deal with Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) Finland in 2002. In July, the band released their first official single, &quot;Would You Love A Monsterman?&quot;, which rose to number one in Finland and spawned a music video. During the summer the band went under the auspices of producer TT Oksala&#x27;s Finnvox Studios to record their first official album, though the debut recording ran into several problems.

In the autumn of 2002, bassist Magnum was fired and replaced by Kalma. Though Lordi&#x27;s debut album had already been recorded when Kalma joined, he appeared in the album art and the composition of the accounts. Their debut album &quot;Get Heavy&quot; was released in November, with a cover design loosely based on Kiss&#x27;s &quot;Love Gun&quot; album. The original first sketch of the cover was based on Kiss&#x27;s &quot;Destroyer&quot; album. The album won the 2003 Emma award for best domestic hard rock or heavy metal album, and &quot;Get Heavy&quot; has sold more than 67,000 copies. It was certified platinum in Finland in 2003 and multi-platinum in 2006.

Lordi played their first gig on 8 December 2002, in Helsinki at the Nosturi Club. In 2003, Lordi appeared at several music events in Finland and abroad, especially in Germany, where they played as a part of the Wacken Road Show. During some of the Germany tour, Lordi played as Nightwish&#x27;s support act. The tour boosted both bands&#x27; popularity in Germany and helped them sign a recording contract with the German record company Drakkar. Nightwish had already achieved solid success with joint concerts in Germany and Lordi also raised their profile in Germany.
At the beginning of 2004, Lordi began recording their second studio album. This time the album was produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, with whom the band got along well. This second album was first released on 14 April 2004 as &quot;The Monsterican Dream&quot;. Two songs from the album, &quot;My Heaven is Your Hell&quot; and &quot;Blood Red Sandman&quot;, had been released as singles. Corresponding with the release of the album, the band&#x27;s costumes and image were also reformed. The special edition of the album also contained a DVD of the band&#x27;s own short film, &quot;The Kin&quot;. The film, despite the success of the album it was attached to, has been poorly received. The album went gold two years after its release.

In February 2005 Lordi&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Monster Show&quot; was released by Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary had originally intended to market a collection of records in the United States, but these plans were halted due to financial problems. Sanctuary, however, published a compilation album in the UK. In Finland, a collection was published by Sony BMG.

The idea of &quot;The Monster Show&quot; disc collection has its roots in the spring of 2004, around the release of &quot;The Monsterican Dream&quot; album. Mr Lordi, while interviewing the band Kiss for Inferno magazine, gave the band&#x27;s bassist/vocalist, Gene Simmons, a copy of Lordi&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Get Heavy&quot; (2002). Later, Simmons&#x27; assistant announced that Simmons would be willing to publish Lordi&#x27;s albums in the United States, but if the band would like to share sales revenue, it would be better to publish with Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary did not want to publish either of the studio albums individually and instead preferred a compilation of the best songs. Thus, songs were picked from &quot;Get Heavy&quot; and &quot;The Monsterican Dream&quot;, and collected in the compilation album &quot;The Monster Show&quot;. The collection was published in the spring of 2005 during the European Monstour.

Meanwhile, the internal atmosphere of the band increased in intensity and led to a dispute between members. Later that year, bassist Kalma wanted to resign because of family and financial problems. Mr Lordi tried to persuade Kalma to stay and suggested that he just play the biggest tours and other contractually obligated performances. Kalma, however, did not relent, because he wanted to be involved with the band either in full or not at all. Kalma did, however, play the bass units for the future &quot;The Arockalypse&quot; album. Kalma left the band just before Lordi entered the Eurovision Song Contest qualifier.

Two new members joined the band, bassist OX and keyboardist Awa. This change in members spawned more alterations to the band&#x27;s costumes.

===2006–2008: &quot;The Arockalypse&quot; and Eurovision===
Lordi&#x27;s third album &quot;The Arockalypse&quot; was released on 1 May 2006. On 20 May 2006, Lordi made history by winning the Eurovision Song Contest held in Athens with the song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;, becoming the first Finnish group to win the contest and consequently, the first rock/metal act to win; Finland would then send power metal band Teräsbetoni in 2008. The song scored 292 points, which was then an all-time points record. Pasi Rantanen from the band Thunderstone performed backing vocals, wearing a Gene Simmons Kiss mask.

Lordi opened the fall of 2006 with the Bringing Back the Balls to Europe tour; the concert DVD was released in February 2007 as &quot;Bringing Back the Balls to Stockholm 2006&quot;. The tour ended with a surprise: during the last gig in London, on 31 October 2006, the band&#x27;s former bassist, Kalma, was seen as a guest on stage.

In November 2006, Lordi headlined the MTV Europe Music Awards, and Mr Lordi presented the &quot;Best Rock&quot; award. Around the same time, Bill Aucoin, best known as the original manager of Kiss, became Lordi&#x27;s manager. In the spring of 2007, Lordi created the Bringing Back the Balls tour, which toured Japan and the Baltic countries. In May, the band was involved in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 held in Helsinki, and opened the competition with their winning song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;.

In early summer 2007 in Oulu, the members of Lordi participated in filming of the horror film &quot;Dark Floors&quot;, which premiered on 8 February 2008. In July 2007, Lordi toured North America with the Ozzfest festival, but ended up canceling off-date shows during that tour.

After the Ozzfest tour ended in late August, Lordi went on a short break. In September, it was announced that the band would go on a new tour of the U.S. with the band Type O Negative, beginning on 12 October 2007 and ending on 31 October 2007. At the end of the tour the band returned to Finland to record the theme song, &quot;Beast Loose in Paradise&quot;, for the 2008 film, &quot;Dark Floors&quot;.

===2008–2012: &quot;Deadache&quot;, &quot;Babez for Breakfast&quot; and Otus&#x27; death===

Lordi began recording their fourth album in the spring of 2008 and the album was released on 29 October 2008. The album, &quot;Deadache&quot;, was produced by Nino Laurenne. The release spurred yet another change in the band&#x27;s costumes. The album was similar in style to its predecessors, melodic hard rock and heavy metal, though with more of a horror theme. Prior to the completion of the disc, it was revealed that it featured more piano solos than its predecessors, and that the recital &quot;Missing Miss Charlene&quot; featured a child singing. The album&#x27;s first single was called &quot;Bite It Like a Bulldog&quot;, and it was published on 3 September 2008.

Lordi announced before the release of the album that &quot;Deadache&quot; would be marketed internationally, like its immediate predecessor.

Shortly after the publication of &quot;Deadache&quot;, Lordi made a tour of the United States in November in conjunction with Lizzy Borden. Lordi performed &quot;Bite It Like a Bulldog&quot; on the NBC show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on 6 November 2008.

Mr Lordi spent a week in Los Angeles with Jeremy Rubolino and former Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick writing two new tracks, &quot;Cut Off My Head&quot; and &quot;Call Off The Wedding&quot;. In March 2010 Mark Slaughter and Bruce Kulick played in a part of their new song. &quot;Babez for Breakfast&quot; was recorded in Nashville, and produced by legendary Michael Wagener. The first single, called &quot;This is Heavy Metal&quot;, from the album was released in August 2010, with the album following in September.

On 4 October 2010 it was announced that drummer Kita had left the band, and on 16 October, OX posted on his Twitter account they had found a new drummer. On 26 October 2010, it was announced on Lordi&#x27;s website that Otus had become their new drummer. Otus joined the band just before Lordi&#x27;s &quot;Europe for Breakfast&quot; tour started.

In 2011 Mr Lordi took part in Finnish TV-series &quot;Kuorosota&quot; and because of that reason the band could not make a long tour. However, they played at a few metal festivals.

On 15 February 2012, it was announced that Otus had died. Due to the death of Otus, Lordi canceled all their concerts scheduled for the beginning of 2012, but they had some summer festival concerts that they couldn&#x27;t cancel. Lordi got help from Jimmy Hammer, the drummer of Finnish band Ironcross, who played drums for Lordi&#x27;s 2012 concerts. Jimmy Hammer used a monster disguise to fit in the band, and was only called &quot;the drummer&quot;. His identity was told after.

In September 2012, &quot;Scarchives Vol. 1&quot;, a compilation CD+DVD, was released to celebrate Lordi&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The CD contains previously unreleased old Lordi songs, including all the songs from the unreleased album from 1997, &quot;Bend Over And Pray The Lord&quot;. The DVD contains Lordi&#x27;s first concert in Helsinki 2002. The video was edited by Otus.

Keyboardist Awa left the band in the fall of 2012. She was seen for the last time during Lordi&#x27;s 20th anniversary concert, at Simerock in Rovaniemi, Finland on 11 August.

===2012–2018: &quot;To Beast or Not to Beast&quot; to &quot;Monstereophonic&quot;===
Lordi began recording their sixth studio album on 1 September 2012 with two new members, Mana as the new drummer and Hella as the new keyboardist. This album was recorded at WireWorld Studio in Nashville, and produced and mixed by Michael Wagener, like the previous one. The first single from the new album, &quot;The Riff&quot;, was released digitally on 8 February 2013. The studio album &quot;To Beast or Not to Beast&quot; was recorded in March 2013.

After the release of the single, the band took part in Wok WM competition in Germany. The album was released on 1 March 2013. A European tour in support of the new album, &quot;Tour Beast Or Not Tour Beast&quot;, started in April 2013. The tour also included one concert in Japan.

Lordi started the recordings for their seventh studio album on 2 June in Finnish Finnvox studios with the producer Mikko Karmila. In July the band moved to a secret place in Lapland to continue the recordings.

On 28 June in Savonlinna, Finland the first official Lordi-exhibition was opened, &quot;The Other Side of Lordi&quot;. There Lordi&#x27;s former costumes and stage props were shown, including Lordi&#x27;s album cover artworks (painted by Mr Lordi). Mr Lordi and Amen visited the exhibition during the opening night.
On 31 July 2014, the group announced that the title of their seventh studio album would be &quot;Scare Force One&quot;. The album was recorded in June and was released on 31 October in Europe, 3 November in North America, and 26 November in Japan with a bonus track. The first single from the album, &quot;Nailed by the Hammer of Frankenstein&quot;, was released digitally on 19 September.

On 1 November Lordi performed at The Circus in Helsinki to promote the release of the album. The three-month-long European tour &quot;Tour Force One&quot; started on 1 February 2015 and ended in early April.

In early 2015, it was announced via Facebook that Hella was pregnant. The band&#x27;s guitarist, Amen, later confirmed that Hella would be replaced for the summer festivals. In the summer of 2015, Hella&#x27;s temporary replacement, Nalle (Finnish for Teddy Bear), was seen for the first time at Rovaniemi. In November Lordi played 2 gigs in Russia (Saint Petersburg and Moscow), still with Hella. In late 2015, the band announced that a new album was in the works. Recording began in December but was halted after the death of Mr Lordi&#x27;s father.

On 27 February 2016, Lordi performed &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot; in the Finnish Eurovision final, as special guests.

On 14 May 2016, Lordi appeared in the interval act for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016, in a musical number satirising Eurovision songs.

In April 2016, recording began again, with producer Nino Laurenne, who had previously produced Deadache in 2008.
In an interview for &quot;Spark TV&quot;, Mr. Lordi stated that the new album will be released in September. The album, untitled at the time, was described by Mr. Lordi as a &quot;split album&quot;. The first six songs of the album will sound like normal Lordi songs, while the last six songs will be more progressive and will follow a concept. A promotional tour for the album called &quot;European Monstour-2016&quot; began in October 2016.

The single from the album, &quot;Hug You Hardcore&quot;, was released in August 2016. A music video for the song was later released. Lordi announced the title of the eighth album, Monstereophonic (Theaterror vs. Demonarchy) on 13 July, which was released on 16 September.

Later the band announced that they would be touring North America and Canada for the first time in 2017. The tour began on 2 February and concluded on 4 March.

===2018–2020: &quot;Sexorcism&quot; and departure of OX===

On 9 March 2018, the band announced the name of the ninth album &quot;Sexorcism&quot; along with its album cover. It was released on 25 May 2018. The band promised that it would be possibly their &quot;most controversial&quot; record to date. Their single from the album &quot;Your Tongue&#x27;s Got the Cat&quot; was released on 13 April 2018. The second single off of the album titled &quot;Naked in My Cellar&quot; was released on 4 May 2018 along with a music video.

Following four festival shows in the summer, a tour in support of the album called &quot;Sextourcism&quot; began in Europe on 9 October in Amstelveen, Netherlands and concluded on 28 December in Helsinki, Finland.

Lordi announced their third live DVD &quot;Recordead Live – Sextourcism in Z7&quot; on 17 May 2019, which was recorded on 23 November 2018 in Pratteln, Switzerland during their tour. It was released on 26 July 2019.

OX announced on 14 March 2019 that he would be departing the band after performing with them for the summer festivals that year. His final show with the band took place at the Reload Festival in Sulingen, Germany on 23 August 2019.

The band later introduced their new bass player, Hiisi. Hiisi&#x27;s first show with the band took place at the Ice Hall in Helsinki on 13 December 2019 as the band was the opening act for Beast in Black.

===2020–2022: &quot;Killection&quot;, &quot;Lordiversity&quot; and Amen&#x27;s departure===

On 27 September 2019, Lordi announced the title of their tenth album &quot;Killection&quot;. It was released on 31 January 2020, followed by a European tour titled &quot;Killectour&quot; in support of the album the same year. The band has said that this album is considered a &#x27;fictional compilation&#x27; album and would contain songs you would normally hear in the early 1970s to mid-1990s. Their single from the album &quot;Shake the Baby Silent&quot;, was released on 8 November 2019. Their second single off the album, &quot;I Dug a Hole in the Yard for You&quot;, was released on 29 November 2019 along with a music video. The third single off the album, &quot;Like a Bee to the Honey&quot;, was released on 17 January 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the band performed a special livestream called &quot;Scream Stream&quot; on 22 May 2020 at the Paha Kurki Rockhouse in the band&#x27;s hometown of Rovaniemi, performing various hits and rarities played by request as well as answering questions from fans.

It was announced on 25 March 2021 that Lordi would be performing at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, joining five other previous winners in Rotterdam on 22 May 2021, performing their Eurovision-winning song &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot; for the &quot;Rock the Roof&quot; interval act.

On 6 April 2021, it was announced that Lordi would be releasing no less than seven studio albums in October 2021. In the statement regarding the albums, the band said: &quot;The albums will sound all different from each other, they&#x27;re all in different styles and fictional eras in the &quot;Killection&quot; timeline. Five of the seven albums are already done, by the way, and number six is well on the way.&quot;

On 19 August 2021, the band released their single &quot;Believe Me&quot;, and simultaneously announced &quot;Lordiversity&quot;, a box set that consists of the band&#x27;s eleventh to seventeenth studio albums: &quot;Skelectric Dinosaur&quot;, &quot;Superflytrap&quot;, &quot;The Masterbeast from the Moon&quot;, &quot;Abusement Park&quot;, &quot;Humanimals&quot;, &quot;Abracadaver,&quot; and &quot;Spooky Sextravaganza Spectacular&quot;. The boxset was released on 26 November 2021. The second single, &quot;Abracadaver&quot;, was released on 24 September 2021. The third single, &quot;Borderline&quot;, was released on 22 October 2021, along with a music video. On 24 November 2021, the fourth single &quot;Merry Blah Blah Blah&quot; was released. The fifth single &quot;Demon Supreme&quot; was released on 17 December 2021. The sixth single &quot;Day Off of the Devil&quot; was released on 7 January 2022.

On 5 May 2022, it was announced that Amen had departed from the band. Mr Lordi released a statement the following day regarding this, clarifying that he had asked Amen to leave the band at the end of February 2022 due to growing tensions. Kone was later named as the new guitarist on 30 May 2022. Kone&#x27;s first show with the band took place at the Rock in the City Festival in Kuopio, Finland on 10 June 2022.

===2022–present: &quot;Screem Writers Guild&quot; and &quot;Limited Deadition&quot;===

On 21 November 2022, Lordi announced that they had signed with the record label, Atomic Fire Records. Along with that news, they simultaneously added that their eighteenth studio album would be released in Spring 2023. The album&#x27;s title, &quot;Screem Writers Guild&quot;, was announced on 1 January 2023, although the title was previously announced in the band&#x27;s biography Lordiary. The track list for the album was later revealed on 26 January 2023, along with the first single, &quot;Lucyfer Prime Evil&quot;. The album was released on 31 March 2023. Two more singles were released to promote the album: &quot;Thing in the Cage&quot; and &quot;Dead Again Jayne&quot;.

Following the release of the album, Lordi joined Sabaton as an opening act for the European leg of their tour, &quot;The Tour To End All Tours&quot;. Lordi were later featured on the front cover of the fashion magazine Vogue Scandinavia.

On 29 June 2024, Mr Lordi confirmed in an interview with Chaoszine that their upcoming nineteenth studio album was already finished, and is set to be released in Spring 2025. The band released a standalone single, &quot;Made of Metal&quot;, in collaboration with OnePlus on 5 August 2024. The band later announced their nineteenth studio album, &quot;Limited Deadition&quot;, which is set to be released on 21 March 2025.

==Style==

===Musical style===
The band&#x27;s horror-related albums, the monster costumes worn by all band members, and the horror elements of their performances are hallmarks of shock rock. The band was mostly influenced by Kiss, but also by Alice Cooper, Iron Maiden, and Twisted Sister.

Although the band is often perceived by the media as a heavy metal band due to their monster costumes, their musical style has more characteristics of the hard rock genre. Over the years, the band&#x27;s musical style has taken a very varied direction between hard rock and metal, with the pattern seeming as though it changes between the two with every album released. Their debut album, &quot;Get Heavy&quot;, represented a large part of traditional hard rock music, but by the release of their &quot;The Monsterican Dream&quot; album in 2004, the band had shifted considerably toward heavier music and horror effects were prominently displayed. However, in their 2006 album &quot;The Arockalypse&quot;, Lordi shifted back toward hard rock, eschewing horror themes and special effects. Their 2008 studio album, &quot;Deadache&quot;, included more typical horror elements, leaning once again toward the heavier side of the spectrum. &quot;Babez for Breakfast&quot; saw the band once again shift back to the traditional hard rock elements, with even greater exposure to the 1980s than the band&#x27;s previous albums. &quot;To Beast or Not to Beast&quot; focuses completely on heavy metal, and was the band&#x27;s heaviest album. Their 2014 album, &quot;Scare Force One&quot;, contains elements of heavy metal while still maintaining the melodic rhythm of hard rock. The band&#x27;s 2016 album, &quot;Monstereophonic&quot;, is a &quot;split album&quot; consisting of two parts. Part one of the album (&quot;Theaterror&quot;) contains hard rock, while part two (&quot;Demonarchy&quot;) is conceptual, and much more progressive than any of Lordi&#x27;s earlier content.

===Costumes and masks===

Lordi members have stated that their costumes were inspired by Kiss and the horror genre. Mr Lordi himself has said that without Kiss, Lordi probably would not exist. The monster masks and costumes the band use are made of foam latex, with some other materials like canvas, metal and leather. The masks and costumes of Lordi are all and always made by Mr Lordi himself. As a professional make-up artist and sculptor, Mr Lordi has the necessary knowledge to produce those things easily. The band members do each other&#x27;s makeup. The band updates their outfits and masks for each new album.

It takes the other band members about one hour to put their masks and costumes on, though it takes Mr Lordi two to three hours to put on his. He has also said that the materials for suits cost &quot;a few hundred euros&quot;.

The monster costumes are such an integral part of Lordi&#x27;s publicity image that they refuse to be photographed or even interviewed without them, even if in some cases it leads to their own discomfort. Lordi has done interviews without their masks but the interviews are always filmed from the back so that their faces are not visible. Previously during interviews, Lordi members spoke only English to the cameras, not their native Finnish. In a brief segment on the BBC reporting about the band attending the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, they were shown lounging beside a pool in full sunlight, while wearing their monster costumes.

===Stage show===

Pyrotechnics and horror elements are important parts of Lordi&#x27;s stage show, designed and mostly created by Mr Lordi. Lordi&#x27;s pyrotechnics are inspired by Kiss, while the horror elements are largely derived from horror movies with some influence from Alice Cooper. Their stage platform is also equipped with monster actors, zombies, dolls, tricks, and sometimes stage dancers. Mr Lordi is also known to use a two-headed axe.

In 2009 the band made some new special effects with big help from the Weta Workshop of New Zealand. The workshop has also designed scenery for movies such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;King Kong,&quot; and &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;.

====Unmasked by the media====
Despite the band&#x27;s strict approach in relation to their costumes, multiple newspapers have published unlicensed photos of the band members without makeup. On 15 March 2006, the Finnish tabloid &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; published a photograph of Mr Lordi in civilian clothing, with his face partially showing.

On 24 May 2006, the Finnish tabloid magazine &quot;&quot; (Seven Days) published an old picture of Mr Lordi&#x27;s face on the front page, and two days later another tabloid, &quot;Katso!&quot; (&quot;Look!&quot;), published unmasked pictures of the other four band members. Both magazines were heavily criticized by their readers for publishing these pictures, which led to swift apologies from both magazines and promises not to publish unmasked pictures of Lordi anymore. On 26 May 2006, video footage was shown on television in Lithuania. It featured four men dressed in black, sitting by the table at the airport in Athens. After a few seconds, Heikki Paasonen (the Eurovision Finnish commentator) in a black Lordi shirt came and stood in front of the camera, covering the view.

==Tributes==

Lordi&#x27;s Square, in the center of Rovaniemi, Finland, the hometown of the lead singer Mr Lordi, was renamed shortly after the band&#x27;s victory at the Eurovision Song Contest. It was part of a redevelopment of the Rovaniemi city center. After the Eurovision victory, all the members of the line-up at the time got tributes from their hometowns.

Itella, the Finnish postal service, issued a Lordi postage stamp in May 2007 in recognition of their Eurovision win. Itella had already released Lordi&#x27;s Christmas single, &quot;It Snows in Hell&quot; in a special Christmas card edition.

A brand of soda, &quot;Lordi Cola&quot;, was named after them and was launched in September 2006, featuring labels designed by Mr Lordi, several depicting individual members and one featuring the whole band.

The 2.6.17-rc5 version of the Linux kernel was named after Lordi.

A themed restaurant named &quot;Lordi&#x27;s Rocktaurant&quot; opened on Koskikatu Street near Lordi&#x27;s Square in Rovaniemi in 2006, with stage props and costumes the band used. The restaurant expanded to the Rinteenkulma shopping center in 2008, but closed in 2011 after its rental contract ran out, having reportedly been in financial difficulties the previous year.

<text>Darkwoods My Betrothed are a Finnish black metal band from Kitee.

== History ==
Formed in 1993 as Virgin&#x27;s Cunt, they set out to be the &quot;most blasphemous black metal band in Europe&quot;. After recording a couple demos under this name, the band changed their name to Darkwoods My Betrothed. They recorded the demo &quot;Dark Aureolis Gathering&quot; in 1994, not too different from the band&#x27;s roots in extreme black metal, but with maturity in the song-writing and delivery and combining a traditional black metal shriek with a wail-type of scream.

In 1995, Hammerheart Productions released &quot;Heirs of the Northstar&quot;, their first full-length album, which was a turning point for the group, as they started to experiment with a slower-paced and more melodic viking metal sound, and use of &quot;drunken Viking&quot; style clean vocals mixed with traditional black metal screams. The lyrics were also quite different from those in earlier songs. Moving away from dark and Satanic, bassist/lyricist Teemu began a fascination with Odinism and the Gods of Valhalla, and marked anger towards Christianity.

1996 saw the release of &quot;Autumn Roars Thunder&quot;, this time under the Solistitium label. Though retaining the same anti-Christian and Odinistic rhetoric, the music itself moved away from the melodic viking approach and returned to faster and more black metal-oriented songwriting.

In 1998, the band returned with &quot;Witch-Hunts&quot;, a conceptual album which eschewed much of the melodic stylings of the previous two albums; the Viking metal sound was now entirely replaced with black metal. Due to numerous delays by the record label, it was released roughly one year after it was originally planned.

After the release of &quot;Witch-Hunts&quot;, the band split up until they came back in 2000 with a new line-up, a compilation album and potential live work. In 2001, the band split up again.

In December 2020, Teemu &quot;Hexenmeister&quot; Kautonen said in a Finnish Inferno-magazine interview that Darkwoods My Betrothed are active and will release their next studio album in late 2021. The album title was later announced on 6 February 2021 as &quot;Angel of Carnage Unleashed&quot;. The album was released on 12 November 2021. The first single &quot;In Evil, Sickness and in Grief&quot; was released on 30 August 2021.

Upon release, &quot;Angel of Carnage Unleashed&quot; received widespread coverage in the music press, garnering fair to excellent reviews upon release.

<text>Armando Emílio Guebuza (born 20 January 1943) is a Mozambican politician who was the third President of Mozambique from 2005 to 2015.

==Career==
Guebuza, born at Murrupula in Nampula Province, joined the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) at the age of 20, shortly after it began Mozambique&#x27;s war of independence against Portugal. By the time independence was achieved in 1975, Guebuza had become an important general and leader in FRELIMO.

He became interior minister in the Samora Machel government and issued an order forcing most Portuguese residents to leave within 24 hours, known as the 24/20 order because the residents in question were restricted to 20 kilograms of luggage.

During the 1980s Guebuza developed an unpopular program known as &quot;Operation Production&quot; in which jobless people from urban areas were moved to rural areas in the northern part of the country.

Following Machel&#x27;s 1986 death in a plane crash in South Africa, Guebuza, a member of FRELIMO&#x27;s Politburo, served briefly as part of a 10-member collective head of state. He was part of a committee investigating the circumstances of the crash, which came to no certain conclusion. He represented FRELIMO at the peace negotiations with the RENAMO guerrilla group that led to the Rome General Peace Accords, signed in Rome on 4 October 1992. During the transitional phase towards the first general elections in 1994, he represented the Government of Mozambique in the joint Supervision and Monitoring Commission, the highest implementing body of the General Peace Accords.

Following the abandonment of socialist economic policies by President Joaquim Chissano, which included the privatization of state companies, Guebuza became a successful and wealthy businessman, particularly in the construction, exports and fishing industries.

He was chosen as FRELIMO&#x27;s presidential candidate in 2002 after a tough contest within the party. He became Secretary General of the party in the same year.

==President==

Guebuza was the candidate of FRELIMO for the December 2004 presidential elections, in which he won with 63.7% of the vote. He became president of Mozambique on 2 February 2005 and was re-elected for a second five-year term of office on 28 October 2009. Guebuza is the first man to enter the Mozambican presidency with a non-socialist party programme and ideology.

International observers to the elections criticized the fact that the National Electoral Commission (CNE) did not conduct fair and transparent elections. They listed a range of shortcomings by the electoral authorities that benefited the ruling party – FRELIMO.

==Personal interests==

Armando Guebuza is one of the wealthiest individuals in Mozambique, which according to Marcelo Mosse has earned the president the nickname &quot;Mr Gue-Business&quot;: He was a shareholder of Laurentina, the first Mozambique brewery, and was one of the main shareholders in the Nosso Banco (formerly Banco Mercantil de Investimentos).

<text>Walter Plowright CMG FRS FRCVS (20 July 1923 in Holbeach, Lincolnshire – 19 February 2010 in London) was an English veterinary scientist who devoted his career to the eradication of the cattle plague rinderpest. Plowright received the 1999 World Food Prize for his development of tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV), the key element in the quest to eliminate rinderpest. Rinderpest became the first animal disease to be eliminated worldwide.

He was the second son of Jonathan and Mahala Plowright. He attended Moulton Grammar School which transferred to Spalding Grammar School in 1939. He graduated from the Royal Veterinary College in London in 1944 and was commissioned into the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.

As a young veterinary pathologist, Plowright carried out research in Kenya and Nigeria. The East African Veterinary Research Organization at Muguga in Kenya provided the base for Plowright and his colleagues to adopt the cell-culture techniques used to develop the polio vaccine to produce a live attenuated (non-pathogenic) virus for use as a rinderpest vaccine. 
Plowright used a mono-layer of kidney cells to culture the virus until it became non-virulent and could be transmitted from one cattle to another, producing lifelong immunity against rinderpest. Unlike its predecessors, tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV) could be used safely in all types of cattle, it could be produced very economically and conferred lifelong immunity.

The research and application techniques that brought Plowright success in fighting rinderpest were later replicated by his colleagues to vaccinate against sheeppox and lumpy skin disease.

In 1964, Plowright returned to the United Kingdom to oversee animal disease research there until his 1983 retirement. He chaired the Royal Veterinary College’s microbiology and parasitology department from 1971 to 1978. He was Head of Microbiology at the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, Berkshire from 1978 to 1983. In addition to rinderpest, Plowright also contributed to the study of such viral animal diseases as African swine fever, malignant catarrhal fever, poxviruses, and herpesviruses.

He was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Society of London and received the Order of St Michael and St George. He also received the World Organisation for Animal Health&#x27;s Gold Medal and the Animal Health Trust’s Outstanding Scientific Achievement Award. He was awarded the King Baudouin International Development Prize 1984-1985 by the Belgian monarch.

<text>Ottapalam (also spelled Ottappalam) is a town, taluk and municipality in the Palakkad District, Kerala, India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ottapalam taluk. Ottapalam is located about from district headquarters Palakkad. Ottapalam is located along the banks of Bharathapuzha, second longest river of the state.

It is one of the major commercial centres in the district. It is also one of the major filming locations in Kerala.

==Etymology==
==History==
The area was formerly known as &quot;Ayirur Thekkummuri&quot; Desam. The present-day Ottapalam, Pattambi and Cherpulassery areas were part of the medieval &quot;Nedunganad&quot; kingdom. &quot;Nedunganathiripad&quot; (Nedungadi) was the main ruler of &quot;Nedunganad&quot;. The headquarters was at Makovilakam near Kodikunnu, Chembulangad. &quot;Nedunaganad&quot; was ruled by the Nairs of Kavalappara, Thrikkadeeri, Kannambra, Vattakkavil Perumbada under the leadership of &quot;Nedunganathiripad&quot;. Ottappalam was the administrative area of Thrikkadeeri Nair. Its north side starts at Ayirur-Vadakkummuri near Mannarkkad and ends at Ayirur-Thekkummuri. After passing Ayirur-Thekkummuri, crossing the &#x27;Ottapalam of Kanniyampuram river&#x27;, then it comes the place to pay a toll for Kavalappara Nair.

Around 1487 AD, the region was annexed to the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut. The Zamorin appointed his chieftain at Kavalappara &quot;Kovilakam&quot;. After the long rule of the Zamorin of Calicut, it became a part of the Kingdom of Mysore around 1766. It came under the rule of East India Company with the Treaty of Seringapatam in 1792. The British formed the Malabar District and built their headquarters at Kozhikode. The headquarters of North Malabar was at Thalassery and that of South Malabar was at Cherpulassery. The headquarters of South Malabar was later changed to Ottapalam. Ottapalam was a part of Walluvanad Taluk of Malappuram Revenue Division in Malabar District with its Taluk headquarters at Perinthalmanna during British Raj. The railway was installed and the town was renamed as Ottappalam. The South Malabar Special Court started functioning at Ottappalam by 1880, and with that Ottappalam became the common name for the town. Gradually, the name Ayirur-Thekkummuri was confined to the land records.

Before Indian Independence, present-day Kerala state was scattered in South Canara and Malabar Districts of British India and two princely states namely Cochin and Travancore. The first All-Kerala conference of Indian National Congress was held in 1921 at Ottapalam, which was the then capital of South Malabar, on the bank of the river Bharathappuzha, which also later demanded a separate state for the Malayalam-speaking regions in future Independent India. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee was formed in that conference. Before that, Malabar District, Cochin, and Travancore had separate Congress committees.

<text>Brigadier Arnold William Potts, (16 September 1896 – 1 January 1968) was an Australian grazier and army officer who served in the First World War and led the 21st Brigade of the Second Australian Imperial Force during its defence of the Kokoda Track during the Second World War. He had a distinguished career, however, his place in history has largely been unacknowledged due to his dismissal by General Sir Thomas Blamey, at the very point when Potts had fought the Japanese to exhaustion. His fighting withdrawal over the Kokoda Trail has been called &quot;one of the most critical triumphs in Australian military history and one that an apathetic nation has still to honour&quot;. Many contemporaries as well as Potts&#x27; official biographer regard this sacking as one of the most disgraceful actions of Blamey&#x27;s military career. Following his dismissal, Potts went on to command the 23rd Brigade during the Bougainville campaign where he earned a reputation for setting high standards. He retired from the military following the end of the war and unsuccessfully pursued a career in politics. He died in 1968, aged 71.

==Early life==
Arnold Potts was born on 16 September 1896 at Peel on the Isle of Man to William, a schoolmaster, and Mary Potts. In 1904, at the age of eight, Potts&#x27; family emigrated to Western Australia and he attended Cottesloe State School before progressing on to Guilford Grammar School. During his formative years he was a keen sportsman, even despite his short stature, representing Guilford in rowing, football, shooting and athletics.

A natural leader, he became a prefect and rose to the rank of colour sergeant in the school&#x27;s Cadet unit. In 1913, Potts sat and passed the University of Adelaide&#x27;s entrance exam for English, geometry and trigonometry. In early 1914 he left Guilford and moved to Pinjarra where he attended Fairbridge Farm School, working as a farmhand. Upon his arrival in Pinjarra, Potts—having turned 18—progressed from the Senior Cadets to the Citizens Force, after which he transferred to the 86th Infantry Regiment.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914 Potts requested to the join the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), a volunteer force that was being formed for active service overseas. On 26 January 1915 he was called up and he was quickly promoted to acting sergeant while still only 18, due both to his prior service and his obvious leadership qualities. He soon earned the respect of his men, most of whom were much older than he. Potts was posted as a reinforcement to 16th Battalion at Gallipoli in July, just in time to participate in the bloody battles of 7 and 8 August.

He stayed with the battalion after it was evacuated from the peninsula in December 1915. In January 1916, Potts was commissioned second lieutenant. In July 1916, following a period of re-organisation in Egypt, the infantry units of the AIF were transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium. In August, Potts, who by this time had been promoted to lieutenant and given command of the 4th Light Trench Mortar Battery, was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during the Battle of Mouquet Farm. He had led his battery in unstinting support of the rest of the battalion during its advance, even though the battery itself had been almost continually under attack in the most horrendous of conditions. The citation for the medal reads:

Later in the war, having been promoted to captain, Potts was able to transfer back to the 16th Battalion and on 6 July 1918, near Hamel, he received a serious gunshot wound in the chest, which he barely survived.

==Inter war years==
As a result of his wounds, Potts was classified as 20 per cent disabled, and after repatriation in early 1919 he returned to Western Australia where he worked as a jackaroo until he purchased his own farm in Kojonup, Western Australia in 1920. He continued to serve part-time in the Militia, however, in 1922 he was placed on the Reserve of Officers list and effectively retired due to defence cutbacks at the time. In 1926 he married Doreen (Dawn) Wigglesworth. They had three children; David (1928), Judith (1932) and Nancy (1938). His letters to his wife throughout his military career provide an insight into his opinions and feelings on events.

In 1938, as tensions in Europe grew, Potts became involved with the Militia again and was instrumental in the re-formation of the 25th Light Horse Regiment.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Potts was placed in command of the regiment&#x27;s &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron and he set to work training the young national servicemen that were assigned to the unit following the resumption of the compulsory training scheme. As the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act (1903)&quot; still precluded the Militia from being sent outside of Australian territory to fight, an all volunteer force was raised for overseas service known as the Second Australian Imperial Force. In April 1940, Potts requested a transfer to this force and although still suffering from the effects of the wounds he had received in 1918 he was passed medically fit and granted the rank of major. He was assigned to the newly formed 2/16th Battalion. Although by now 44 years of age, he was a dynamic and widely respected officer. He played a key role in staffing the battalion and getting it ready for action in Syria in 1941, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for inspiring leadership at the Battle of the Litani River on 9 and 10 June. His performance during the Syrian campaign was further rewarded with a Mention in Despatches, promotion to lieutenant colonel and command of the 2/16th.

===Kokoda Trail Campaign===

In 1942 Potts returned to Australia and in April he was promoted to temporary brigadier and given command of the 21st Brigade, stationed in south-east Queensland. At this time the Japanese had established a beachhead on the north coast of New Guinea. It was clear to Potts that the 21st would soon be fighting in the jungle. He devised and implemented the first specific jungle training for Australian troops. Potts took his troops up into the Blackall Range, where the thick scrub and steep grades gave these experienced desert fighters an idea of what lay ahead for them. War game exercises indicated that in such country communications would break down, and evacuation of wounded would be difficult.

Meanwhile, the Japanese had advanced south from their beachhead at Gona and Buna, and taken the strategic village of Kokoda. General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of South West Pacific Area, was at this time planning a landing on Japanese-held Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Concerned that enemy troops would be withdrawn from Gona to reinforce Guadalcanal, MacArthur asked for a serious commitment of Australian troops to New Guinea. The 21st Brigade was sent to Port Moresby, and the 25th Brigade to Milne Bay. Potts flew into Port Moresby on 8 August and set up a staging post at Koitaki, close to the start of the trail at Owers Corner. His orders were clear yet daunting: recapture Kokoda so it could be used as a base to push the Japanese back to Gona.

At this time the two militia battalions—the 39th and 53rd Battalions—who had been defeated at Kokoda were dug in at Isurava and Alola. These were to join with the three battalions of the 21st to form &quot;Maroubra Force&quot; under Potts&#x27; command. On 16 August his 2/14th started on the long and difficult trail towards Myola. The 2/16th followed the next day, with the 2/27th left at Port Moresby as a reserve. Potts was promised 40,000 rations would await him at Myola, to be dropped in by Dakota transport planes. The night before beginning the trek, Potts had learned that a further 1,800 Japanese combat troops had landed at Gona. 

Despite their jungle training, the Australians found the going incredibly difficult. Captain R.N. Thompson of the 2/14th said &quot;I was one of the fittest members, but on the second day, climbing the Golden Stairs I was extremely fatigued. A small dixie of tea made me vomit and I could not eat.&quot; While they struggled over the ranges, the Japanese bombed the Port Moresby airfield, destroying two of the Dakotas. When Potts reached Myola he found only 5,000 rations. Mystery and controversy abound regarding the missing rations. Potts seems to have harboured doubts about the air drops, as he had each soldier carry five days&#x27; rations to Myola.

Without rations, the 2/14th and 2/16th could not continue on to reinforce the more advanced militia battalions at Alola and Isurava. Potts made his way forward to Alola and assumed command of Maroubra Force from Brigadier Selwyn Porter on 23 August 1942. When he saw the shattered state of the 39th Battalion, he realised that to achieve his aims he would need to bring forward the relatively fresh 21st Brigade troops. Before he had a chance to implement this, the Japanese under Major General Tomitaro Horii attacked the 39th at Isurava on 26 August. For four days the Australians held off the enemy who had superiority in numbers and supplies. Potts moved in the 2/14th and 2/16th to support. The Japanese held elevated positions on either side of the main trail, and were able to hammer Maroubra Force with mortar and machine gun fire. Threatened with encirclement, Potts withdrew in stages, mounting small delaying actions where possible. Maroubra Force reached Efogi on 5 September.

On 3 September Potts had received orders from his superior in Port Morseby, Major General Arthur &quot;Tubby&quot; Allen, to hold Myola and gather for an offensive. However he considered the dry lake bed at Myola, surrounded by heights, as untenable. The following day, he signalled Allen, stating: &quot;Country unsuitable for defended localities. Regret necessity abandon Myola. No reserves for counter-attack.&quot; Potts destroyed all supplies at Myola and moved south to the next suitable feature, Brigade Hill. Potts had been pleading with Allen for some time to be given his third battalion, the 2/27th. MacArthur insisted they stay at Port Moresby until success was gained at Milne Bay. Finally Allen released the 2/27th, who came up to join Maroubra Force at Kagi on 4 September, relieving the 39th Battalion. When the 2/14th and 2/16th arrived on 6 September, Potts finally had a full brigade. He aimed at holding each position for maximum time and at maximum cost to the enemy, before withdrawing. He was aware that with each mile back towards Port Moresby the Japanese supply and communication line became longer and more fragile.

====Battle of Brigade Hill====

Maroubra Force dug in on Brigade Hill, and awaited an attack. After dark on 6 September Horii&#x27;s pursuing force appeared, slowly and carefully coming down the steep slope opposite the Australian position, their way lit by &quot;lanterns&quot; made of pieces of smouldering Australian rubber-coated signal wire. Horii patiently took his troops in a wide encircling movement around the Australians, despite a bombing raid called in by the alarmed Potts. Next morning Potts signalled Allen; &quot;Will not give ground if you guarantee my line of communication ... full of fight, but physically below par, mainly feet and dysentery ... Respectfully consider offensive ops require more than one Bde [brigade] task.&quot;

At 4.30 am on 8 September the attack came, initially frontal, then a flank attack of 5,000 men cut off Potts&#x27; Brigade HQ battalion from the rest of the force. At times the enemy were just from the edge of Potts&#x27; perimeter. The signal wire had been cut by now, and communications with the battalions were shaky. A message got through by wireless transmitter, that if as seemed likely the HQ was wiped out, Major Anthony Caro, commander of 2/16th was to take command of the brigade and fall back to Menari. Potts and his HQ were saved by the fact that Horii did not concentrate forces on eliminating them, instead maintaining overall pressure to try to annihilate all three battalions. 2/14th and 2/16th charged the Japanese lines but failed to break through to HQ. However the damage inflicted on the enemy was crucial in slowing their pursuit, as Potts made his way to Menari. He left orders for the battalions to make their own way and rejoin him there. As the Japanese controlled the main trail, all three battalions had to take rough secondary tracks or go cross country.

One major difference from battles in other theatres of the war was the burden of the wounded on their unit. They could not be left for the enemy to care for, as had been the case in Syria. Years later Potts recalled &quot;We had to sit in the jungle listening to the screams of comrades tortured by the Japanese in an attempt to provoke an attack&quot;. Papuan bearers were not used in battle zones, so the wounded had to be carried by their comrades, slowing them down. 2/14th and 2/16th left their wounded to be carried by 2/27th, the last battalion to withdraw. 120 men at a time were engaged carrying stretcher cases. Many severely wounded men walked to free a stretcher for someone worse off than themselves. The Japanese pursued the 2/27th, but an audacious counterattack by &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27; Companies bought the Australian rearguard some time. The adjutant of the 2/27th, Captain Harry Katekar, was quoted as saying, &quot;The Japs were so shocked they broke contact. We didn&#x27;t see them again that day&quot;.

The 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions slept where they fell on the trail on the night of 8 September, but managed to re-unite with Potts and 21st Brigade headquarters at Menari the next day. The 2/27th Battalion was unable to reach the village before the rest of the brigade was again forced to retreat by the advancing Japanese. Menari was extremely exposed to observation from further up the trail, and the village was already under barrage from Japanese artillery and light machine guns by the time the first 2/16th troops arrived. Potts waited for the 2/27th until 2.30 pm, then gave orders to abandon Menari. The 2/27th and their cargo of wounded from the other battalions were forced to follow paths parallel to the main trail, but eventually rejoined the main Australian force at Jawarere.

====Rowell relieves Potts====
During the Battle of Brigade Hill an Intelligence officer, Captain Geoff Lyon arrived from Port Moresby, sent by Allen to give him an on-the-ground assessment. He was able to contact Potts, and relayed to Allen the situation as it was at that moment—dire. Allen responded with a signal to Potts:
&quot;Has [Lyon&#x27;s] message been sent with your approval? Is situation stated correct? Advise immediately.&quot; Potts, under close attack and facing being wiped out, replied simply &quot;Message confirmed&quot;.

It was at this point that the commander of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell decided to recall Potts to Port Moresby, returning Porter to command of the 21st Brigade. Rowell&#x27;s motives have been debated, but they appear to be a combination of frustration at the lack of forward movement, and a desire to have a first hand account of the situation. Rowell did not consult with Allen. He also sent a message to Major General George Alan Vasey, Deputy Chief of General Staff, informing him of Potts&#x27; removal. He continued &quot;I trust you appreciate the gravity of immediate situation, and will produce additional troops asked for particularly infantry, with minimum delay&quot;.

When Potts arrived back in Port Moresby on 12 September Allen organised a meeting between Potts, Rowell and himself. Given a chance to relate the difficulties he had faced, and correct some misapprehensions, it appears Potts was able to mollify Rowell. Soon after, war correspondent Chester Wilmot, who had also been over the Owen Stanley Ranges on foot and seen the fighting, was able to corroborate Potts&#x27; account in a meeting with Rowell.

====Kokoda Trail Campaign after Potts&#x27; removal====
Subsequent events serve to illustrate Potts&#x27; difficulties, and his success against the odds in command of the 21st Brigade. Potts handed over to Porter on 10 September at Nauro. Porter&#x27;s first move was towards Port Moresby—to higher ground at Ioribiwa. Here he was joined by the 25th Brigade under Brigadier Ken Eather. With fresh troops, fighting an overstretched enemy, Eather still found he needed to withdraw to Imita Ridge. Rowell acceded to this request, but instructed Allen &quot;any further withdrawal is out of the question&quot;. In August the Americans had landed at Guadalcanal. Now the Japanese hierarchy ordered Horii to make a fighting withdrawal to the Gona/Buna beachhead. The quick fall of Port Moresby they had anticipated had not come about, and as the campaign dragged on it was proving a drain on men and materiel needed elsewhere. After dealing with the American incursion at Guadalcanal, a new attack over the mountains of Papua could begin.

Potts&#x27; initial task had been to retake the village of Kokoda. In the end the 25th Brigade walked in and took vacant possession on 2 November, the Japanese having abandoned it some time before. The Japanese were by now a shadow of the powerful force that had faced Potts in August. The survivors were riddled with dysentery and starving. Some evidence points to cannibalism. Japanese war correspondent Seizo Okada reported that after receiving the order to return to Buna, &quot;for a time the soldiers remained stupefied among the rocks on the mountain side. Then they began to move, and once in retreat they fled for dear life ... discipline was completely forgotten&quot;.

====Potts loses a supporter====
On 12 September General Sir Thomas Blamey visited Port Moresby. At this point Maroubra Force (still under Potts) had withdrawn to Ioribiwa, but nearby the fresh 25th Brigade under Eather were about to step into the breach. Allen and Rowell were confident of prompt success against a clearly exhausted enemy, and Blamey was easily convinced to share their optimism. There were smiles all round as he flew back to Australia. He briefed Prime Minister John Curtin and the rest of the Advisory War Council on 17 September. Despite being met with some scepticism, Blamey supported his officers and maintained that there was nothing to fear—Port Moresby was safe from land attack.

That night Curtin received a call from MacArthur, who had just heard about Eather&#x27;s withdrawal to Imita Ridge. MacArthur told Curtin to send Blamey back to Papua to take personal command of New Guinea Force. Curtin did so, and Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September. This put Rowell and Blamey on a collision course. They had a history of animosity going back to earlier in the war, first in the Middle East then in Greece. Rowell felt that Blamey should have supported him and stood up to Curtin and MacArthur. Relations were fractious, and on 28 September Rowell had had enough. He spoke his mind to his commanding officer, and was dismissed. Potts had just lost his major advocate in Papua.

====Blamey confronts Potts====
On 9 October the 21st Brigade regained their start point at Koitaki. Before the last troops had even made it in from the jungle, Allen asked for a parade. He passed on a personal message from Curtin to the brigade, for &quot;saving Port Moresby and thus Australia&quot;. On 22 October Blamey visited Koitaki at short notice. He requested a private audience with Potts, and Brigade HQ was vacated. Potts&#x27; Staff Captain Ken Murdoch was deeply involved in paperwork and somehow remained to witness the &quot;private&quot; conversation. According to Murdoch, Potts, fresh from Allen&#x27;s glowing endorsement, began by extolling the virtues of his men, and expressed satisfaction with the boost to home front morale they had been able to provide.

Blamey cut him short. He relieved Potts of his command, citing Potts&#x27; failure to hold back the Japanese, despite commanding &quot;superior forces&quot;. Further, Potts had failed to re-take Kokoda despite explicit orders to do so. Blamey explained that Prime Minister John Curtin had told him to say that failures like Kokoda campaign would not be tolerated. Murdoch reports Blamey saying &quot;the men had shown that something was lacking&quot; and that their leaders were to blame. Potts furiously rejected any blame being attached to his battalion commanders. Blamey was not interested in debating the finer points, nor in allowing Potts to remain in contact with those same battalion commanders. He was to leave the brigade immediately and fly to Darwin—a personal address to the brigade would not be possible, nor could he meet and brief his replacement. Murdoch says that the news spread rapidly, and as Staff Captain he was inundated with resignation papers from officers wishing to show solidarity with Potts. Potts instructed Murdoch to reject all resignations.

Rowell was replaced by Lieutenant General Edmund Herring, a man close to Blamey. Now Herring chose Brigadier Ivan Dougherty to replace Potts. During his recent period of command in the Northern Territory, Herring had relieved both his brigadiers, replacing them with younger and better educated officers, one of whom was Dougherty, an officer in whom he had great confidence. Herring believed that his decision to replace Potts with Dougherty, who would command the 21st Brigade for the rest of the war, was the right one. Years later he told official historian Dudley McCarthy that: &quot;We knew the terrain was most difficult and the Japs very good jungle fighters ... we had a war to win and it was our job to call in the best man we could. It would have been wrong for us to allow ourselves to be influenced by Potts&#x27; feelings.&quot;

Potts&#x27; removal could charitably be attributed to Blamey&#x27;s inadequate understanding of the circumstances Potts had dealt with on the Kokoda Trail. He may have genuinely believed that another commander in the same circumstances would have pushed back the Japanese and re-taken Kokoda. This is the tack taken by Dudley McCarthy in the official war history; &quot;Blamey and Herring, who did not at that time understand so well the circumstances in which Potts found himself and the way he had acquitted himself, genuinely misjudged him&quot;. Other historians feel that Potts was a scapegoat, removed by Blamey to avoid a showdown with MacArthur. MacArthur maintained in a letter to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, on 6 September that &quot;the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking&quot;. Peter Brune alleges that Blamey&#x27;s removal of Potts was simple self-preservation. &quot;It is staggering to contemplate that an Australian brigade commander could be thrust into a campaign with such a damning inadequacy of military intelligence, support and equipment and yet fight a near flawless fighting withdrawal where the military and political stakes were so terribly important and that could then be relieved from his command as a reward.&quot; General Robert Eichelberger wrote to Herring in 1959, after McCarthy&#x27;s history appeared:

====The &quot;running rabbits&quot; incident====
On 9 November Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on the parade ground at Koitaki. The men of Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. However, instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been &quot;beaten&quot; by inferior forces, and that &quot;no soldier should be afraid to die&quot;. Captain H.D. &quot;Blue&quot; Steward, medical officer of the 2/16th recalled &quot;The troops could have withstood the Japanese field gun more easily than what they received. Blamey got them on edge almost at once by saying that they had been beaten by inferior troops in inferior numbers. Then he made his famous remark that &#x27;the rabbit that ran away is the rabbit that got shot&#x27;. The whole parade was almost molten with rage and indignation.&quot; Blamey&#x27;s personal assistant Lieutenant Colonel Norman Carlyon, realised that damage had been done. &quot;Standing beside the small platform from which Blamey was to address the troops, I realised that he was in a most aggressive mood. He was soon expressing this in harsh words ... It amazed me that Blamey should deal so insensitively with the men of such a well-proven brigade.&quot;

After the rank and file had left, Blamey addressed the officers. He questioned whether they were worthy of their men, and told them they must improve. Potts was initially dismissive about Blamey&#x27;s address, when informed about it by Major Albert Caro. He passed on the news in a letter to Dawn; &quot;... apparently most of the troops take the speech as a colossal joke against the speaker...&quot; He did however write to Allen asking him to &quot;take the necessary action&quot; regarding Blamey&#x27;s remarks. By the New Year he had been given further details and was enraged. Again writing to his wife; &quot;Hugh sent me a precis of his (T&#x27;s) speech to the old team and to the officers. Hells Bells, it was a cowardly bit of work and untrue in every detail. I&#x27;ll fry his soul in the next world for that bit of &#x27;passing the buck&#x27;. Surely a man in his position is big enough to carry his own mistakes.&quot;

Potts was not the victim of the Koitaki speech. He had already been removed, and appears to have been already marked for minor roles only in the rest of the war. Although Potts was incensed, the real damage done at Koitaki was to the careers of the next generation of young officers. Potts was aware as the war proceeded that men he had trained, cajoled, blasted, encouraged and fought alongside were damned for their association with him. Some have alleged that 21st Brigade&#x27;s next combat role in the battle for Gona saw excessive casualties, due to the burning desire to erase Blamey&#x27;s slur. &quot;By the time the battle for Gona had concluded, the Blamey slur at Koitaki had manifested itself in the interference in the command structure, and the resultant slaughter of soldiers.&quot;

===In Darwin with 23rd Brigade===
Potts replaced Dougherty as commander of the 23rd Brigade in Darwin. It had originally been an AIF brigade, composed of volunteers who were able to serve abroad. As the Japanese advanced through 1941 and 1942, its original battalions had been sent to Ambon, Rabaul and Timor. They were replaced with battalions from the Militia, men who had been conscripted, and could only serve on Australian soil unless they volunteered for the AIF. Friction was inevitable, and the new officers were not all talented man-managers.

With his new brigade, Potts had a new set of battalion commanders, who he proceeded to push to meet his high standards. His methods did not always meet with approval from his superiors. Meanwhile, he was distressed to hear news of his former charges in 21st Brigade. Under Dougherty at Gona they had been thrown against an entrenched Japanese force, which had been massively underestimated in strength. Many good men who had fought alongside Potts in the Middle East and Kokoda died at Gona. He wrote to Dawn &quot;...it&#x27;s a hundred times worse taking that sort of punch [hearing of the casualties] while I am sitting safe&quot;.

Amid the carnage, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, Major Ben Hearman and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper all protested to Dougherty that his tactics were at fault. They all were punished with transfers to backwaters. Cooper (shot in the hip at Gona) has recalled; &quot;...they used to say there were two types of officers: those who were always going to reach the top, and then the others that are always at fault. But then there is the other type like Arnold Potts, who just get on with the job and do it superbly. They are efficient and successful and save men&#x27;s lives while they go about it. But Arnold Potts wasn&#x27;t at Gona.

Potts dealt with his difficulties by devoting himself to training his brigade. It was said that by the time they were committed to action, his 7th and 8th Battalions were better trained than any AIF battalion before them. In April 1943 Blamey inspected and was very impressed with the quality of the brigade. By this stage the Northern Territory Force GOC was &quot;Tubby&quot; Allen, also marking time in a relative backwater. Allen steered Potts away from controversy during Blamey&#x27;s visit.

By March 1944, 23rd Brigade was still training, now in Queensland. Potts kept the pressure on his men, and it was not always welcome. Many of them had not been under fire, and could not relate the punishing fitness regime and battalion manoeuvres to actual combat, as he could. Allen had moved on and Potts&#x27; GOC was now Major General Stanley Savige. Savige hauled him over the coals for being too tough on his battalion commanders. Potts had long-term fears for the future, if the pressure on Japan was eased. He confided to Dawn; &quot;I&#x27;m scared stiff we&#x27;ll all go soft because of further casualties and not hammer the Jap flat. We lose them in this war and the next will be the kids&quot;.

In April at last the brigade was posted overseas, initially to Lae in New Guinea Territory, then to the Wau area. The brigade, now part of II Corps, continued training. Potts was much happier with his battalion commanding officers, but was able to write to Dawn; &quot;I put over a pretty brutal talk to COs ... on matters of jealousies, viewpoints and lack of teamwork. Trod on corns all round and am not popular but that will pass.&quot;

===Bougainville Campaign===


Finally II Corps was transferred to the Solomon Islands. The 23rd Brigade set up HQ in the Green Islands, north of Bougainville on 27 September 1944.

====Green Islands====
The battalions were spread out guarding airfields and naval installations on various neighbouring islands. Potts agitated for a more focused and aggressive role. He was aware that among his troops were men who had volunteered for overseas service four years previously. He also feared that a passive garrison role in the tropics would sap the fitness and discipline he had painstakingly instilled. Potts did his homework, and proposed to Savige a four-point plan of action for the Brigade:
* General reconnaissance against nearby enemy territory, followed by attacks to root out enemy remnants:
* on Choiseul (believed to harbour 300 Japanese)
* at the northern end of Bougainville (1,300)
* and on Buka Island (1,000)

Savige rejected the plans. His justification in the official war history provides a fair and reasonable portrait of Potts, as seen from above in the chain of command: &quot;Potts was a very gallant man and looked for fights, but looking without planning the ways and means to land and support troops on hostile shores was another thing. Further, Potts always found it difficult to envisage or accommodate himself to the overall plan of his commander ... Potts was a character apart from the rest. His personal courage was unsurpassed and his genial nature drew one to him. However, his zeal to be on patrol or with the leading section denied him control of operations which led him to countenance fear of some disaster overtaking his troops&quot;.

Savige eventually realised the northern islands were so quiet, that the 23rd would be better deployed at Torokina in central Bougainville. This required MacArthur&#x27;s approval, which took three months. The brigade passed the time enjoying the facilities that the American garrison troops had left behind, when they were transferred to more glamorous work re-conquering the Philippines. Potts went home on leave to Western Australia for nearly two months, rejoining the brigade at the end of January 1945. Shortly after he received a curt signal from II Corps HQ, asking why he had not nominated anyone for medals recently.

====Central Bougainville====
On 10 April Savige gave Potts control of the central Bougainville sector. He immediately sent out patrols to sniff out Japanese. This put him at odds with Major George Winning, a former commando who had surveyed the whole island when Australian troops first arrived. Winning called Bougainville &quot;a self-supporting POW camp&quot;. &quot;To fight a war here and provoke hostilities will be nothing more than sinful destruction and wastage of bloody fine men who deserve to be laid off and sent home to their people&quot;. In Potts&#x27; view, taking a brigade trained to the peak of fitness and primed to attack and then giving them a garrison job, was actually more hazardous than sending them into battle. He had already lost one battalion commander in Bougainville, not in combat but in a plane crash while on a reconnaissance flight.

Potts established that there was a force of 40–50 enemy in the Berry&#x27;s Hill area, and had reason to believe they were being reinforced. With artillery support and air support from the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the Australians killed and captured a number of the Japanese and pushed their front line forward. Soon resistance stiffened, and it was clear that the hill was held by a significant force. As II Corps had introduced a &quot;no casualties&quot; policy, the Australians withdrew, with one slightly wounded. Patrolling and harassing without any serious engagements continued until June, when 23rd Brigade was sent north.

====Northern Bougainville====
Potts&#x27; new assignment was to contain Japanese troops in the narrow Bonis Peninsula and push them north towards the Buka Passage at the end. There was now believed to be 1,200 Japanese on the peninsula and 1,400 on Buka Island across the passage. By 28 June Potts had his 27th and 8th Battalions positioned at the base of the peninsula, on the east and west sides respectively. The Australian lines of communication were quite stretched, and the Japanese infiltrated constantly. In July an Australian wood-chopping party was attacked and two field ambulance men were killed. The next day a jeep was wrecked by a mine. 8th Battalion lost Captain Ogden to another mine and Lieutenant Webb, killed while leading an ambush patrol.

Following the failure of the landing at Porton Plantation the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. II Corps&#x27; focus now moved to the south, leaving Potts and 23rd Brigade to perform a holding role along the Ratsua front. While carrying this out, with Savige forbidding any forward motion, the brigade lost 7 killed and 17 wounded in patrols and ambushes, three killed and two wounded by friendly mortar fire, 12 wounded by their own booby traps and five in other accidents. During this phase Private Frank Partridge won his Victoria Cross for clearing a number of enemy bunkers despite being seriously wounded.

The Japanese were running low on ammunition and food. They rarely fired unless they had a good target. Potts recorded in his report that enemy morale was good, however &quot;Food captured in the field kitchens consisted mainly of bamboo shoots, roots and vegetable matter generally. Evidence of cannibalism occurred on two occasions, flesh being cut from the calf and thigh of dead Japanese&quot;. As Bougainville was now a very low priority theatre, the Australians also suffered from supply problems. Inadequate shipping, artillery, ammunition and medical supplies hampered Potts&#x27; efforts. The 27 Battalion diary recorded on 1 July; &quot;We&#x27;ve been promised tanks but they have yet to be sighted ... the water situation is also difficult. The L of C [line of command] ... is over 3000 yards long, 2500 yards of which cannot be covered, and consequently enables the Jap to ambush it just when he likes&quot;. However at least they were neither starving nor abandoned totally by their hierarchy, like the Japanese.

Despite these difficulties, Potts continued to conjure up attacking schemes. On 10 July he badgered Savige about an offensive in the Porton area of the Bonis Peninsula. Savige rejected this as completely contrary to their standing orders, and concluded from questioning him that Potts had actually not read them. In his opinion;
&quot;I think this is sufficient to understand Potts and the spirit within his Brigade. Had he lived to fight at Waterloo in a square, when the sole requirement was dogged bravery, he would have been a most successful commander. In modern warfare he was a lone wolf whose chief interest was to lead a patrol or wander along a track in his jeep or on foot.&quot; He linked this tendency to the Kokoda campaign. &quot;Potts feels he must redeem his name after the events of the Kokoda Trail...&quot; For his part, Potts had had enough of the static yet vulnerable role on the Ratsua front, and asked Savige to withdraw his brigade to a smaller front around Buoi. Following this a number of small scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August, after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan on 6 August and 9 August.

====End game in Bougainville====
Emperor Hirohito formally announced the end of hostilities in Tokyo on 15 August, but his loyal troops in the Solomons did not hear the news for some time. II Corps HQ at Torokina advised Australian commanders that it may take 8 days for the information to reach Japanese troops in Bougainville. Potts flew to Torokina for a briefing on the surrender. He was dismayed to realise that front-line troops would play no part in the surrender—&quot;a poor reward to the troops for months of fighting&quot;. The Japanese commander, General Masatane Kanda, was kept waiting by his superiors in Rabaul for permission to surrender. Finally on 7 September, he and Vice-Admiral Tomoshige Samejima arrived at Torokina and formally surrendered to Savige.

Potts returned to 23rd Brigade at Soraken, where he learned he would be taking charge of all of Bougainville and neighbouring islands. Now it truly was a prisoner of war camp as suggested by Major Winning. There were 18,000 Japanese in the Fauro Island area, and camps at Torokina eventually held 8,000. Massive quantities of Japanese arms and ammunition were destroyed or dumped in the sea. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Court, on Savige&#x27;s staff, arranged a parade of senior Japanese officers for Potts. He warned them, &quot;This is one man on our side we haven&#x27;t been able to convince the war is over&quot;. Potts, in full regalia, inspected the seventeen generals and fifteen admirals, all standing rigidly at attention despite tattered uniforms. Court had told him that the Japanese would be expecting fireworks. But at the end of his inspection, having returned to the front and faced his defeated enemy, Potts exclaimed &quot;Good show!&quot; and went along the line shaking hands. Later he said &quot;Many dreadful things had been done during the course of the war – by both sides. There should not be recriminations after the event. Once it was over it was over&quot;.

Potts handed over command of the 23rd Brigade to Brigadier Noel Simpson on 4 December 1945. His farewell order to troops said; &quot;The standard of efficiency as a Brigade and the fighting spirit of the troops will remain always as a vivid memory&quot;. The next day he flew home to Australia. For his service on Bougainville Potts was Mentioned in Despatches twice.

==Later life==
Following the war, Potts returned to farming in Western Australia and briefly attempted to pursue a career in politics, standing unsuccessfully in 1949 as a Country Party candidate for the federal seat of Forrest in the House of Representatives. However, his preferences allowed Liberal challenger Gordon Freeth to defeat Labor minister Nelson Lemmon. Lemmon was well ahead on the first count, but Potts&#x27; preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Freeth on the third count, allowing Freeth to win from third place.

In 1960 Potts was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the New Years Honours List. After several strokes, he became reliant on a wheelchair. He died on 1 January 1968 at Kojonup, aged 71.

<doc id="1083092" wikidata="Q668966" url="?curid=1083092" title="Epigyne">
<text>The epigyne or epigynum is the external genital structure of female spiders. As the epigyne varies greatly in form in different species, even in closely related ones, it often provides the most distinctive characteristic for recognizing species. It consists of a small, hardened portion of the exoskeleton located on the underside of the abdomen, in front of the epigastric furrow and between the epigastric plates.

==Functions==
The primary function of the epigyne is to receive and direct the palpal organ of the male during copulation. The various specific forms of epigynes are correlated, in each case, with corresponding specific differences in the palpus of the male. This specialization prevents individuals of different species from mating. The epigyne covers or accompanies the openings of the spermathecae, which are pouches for receiving and retaining sperm. Frequently, the openings of the spermathecae are on the outer face of the epigyne and can be easily seen.

A secondary function of the epigyne is as an ovipositor.

==Differences in form==

An example of a comparatively simple epigyne is that of &quot;Pirata montanus&quot;. It consists of a nearly plain plate, with the openings of the spermathacae near the posterior lateral corners. A somewhat more complicated form is illustrated by the epigyne of &quot;Trabeops aurantiacus&quot;. In this species, the plate is depressed or furrowed longitudinally, and the depressed area is divided by a ridge-like elevation, which divides the depression into two furrows or channels, each of which leads to the opening of the spermatheca of the corresponding side. This ridge-like elevation is called the &quot;guide&quot;, as its function &quot;seems clearly to be that of a guide to the male embolus, controlling the course of the latter and facilitating its entrance to the spermatheca.&quot; In many cases the guide extends laterally on each side at its posterior end. This is true to a slight extent in the epigyne of &quot;Trabeops&quot;, but more markedly so in that of many species of &quot;Geolycosa&quot;, where the lateral expansions often conceal the openings of the spermathecae, as in the epigyne of &quot;Geolycosa pikei&quot;.

A more complicated form of epigyne is found in spiders of the genus &quot;Araneus&quot;, where there is developed an appendage which is usually soft and flexible, and which is termed the &quot;scape&quot; or &quot;ovipositor&quot;. When there is a well-developed scape, the tip of it is usually more or less spoon-shaped. This part of the scape is termed the &quot;cochlear&quot;. The basal plate of the epigyne which bears the scape, and which forms a porch or hood that covers the opening of the oviduct is called the &quot;atriolum&quot;.

A still more complicated form of epigyne is found in some of the sheet weavers (Linyphiidae) and orb weavers (Araneidae), where the ovipositor consists of two finger-like projections: first, the more common one, the scape, which arises from the atriolum, and consequently in front of the opening of the oviduct; and second, one which arises behind the opening of the oviduct; this is termed the &quot;parmula&quot;. Each of these projections may be grooved on the side facing the oviduct, forming a tube.

<doc id="1083097" wikidata="Q5514543" url="?curid=1083097" title="GSC bus">
<text>GSC is a bus used in many of the HP 9000 workstations and servers. The acronym has various explanations, including &quot;Gecko System Connect&quot; (Gecko being the codename of the 712 workstation), &quot;Gonzo System Connect&quot; and &quot;General System Connect&quot;.

GSC was a general 32-bit I/O bus, similar to NuBus or Sun&#x27;s SBus, although it was also used as a processor bus with the PA-7100LC and PA-7300LC processors. Several variations were produced over time, the later ones running at 40 MHz:

;GSC-1X: The original GSC bus implemented on PA-7100LC and used in the Gecko (712), Mirage (715) and Electra computers. Peak Bandwidth 142 MB/s w/DMA, 106 MB/s with PIO writes.

;GSC+, a.k.a. &quot;Extended GSC&quot; or &quot;EGSC&quot;: Enhancements added for KittyHawk/SkyHawk (U2 chip) that allow for pending transactions. GSC+ enhancements are orthogonal to the GSC-1.5X and GSC-2X enhancements.

;GSC-1.5X: GSC-1X with an additional variable length write transaction.

;GSC-2X: GSC-1.5X with a protocol enhancement to allow data to be sent at double the GCLK rate, with a peak bandwidth of 256 MB/s.

;HSC: High Speed Connect.

Four types of GSC cards were produced: the GIO cards fit into the larger of the two IO card sockets in the 712 workstation. Several were produced, including a second RS-232 serial port, a serial/10BaseT combo, a second graphics card and a Token Ring card.

The 715/Mirage, 725, 735, 755, B-, C-, and J-class workstations, and the D- and R-class servers, used the so-called &quot;EISA form factor&quot;. Many different types of card were produced, including Gigabit Ethernet, single and dual 100 Mbit Ethernet, Ultra-2 SCSI, ATM and graphics.

The K- and T-class servers both used the &quot;3x5&quot; form factor, although the different brackets prevent the cards being interchangeable. Fibre channel and Gigabit Ethernet cards both exist.

<text>Brian Christian de Claiborne Howard (13 March 1905 – 15 January 1958) was an English poet and later a writer for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

==Biography==
Howard was born to American parents in Hascombe, Surrey, of Protestant descent. He was a descendant of Benjamin Franklin, and brought up in London; his father, Francis Gassaway Howard, was the son of the writer Frank Gassaway, and was an associate of James Whistler.

He was educated at Eton College, where he was one of the &quot;Eton Arts Society&quot; group including Robert Byron, Harold Acton, Oliver Messel, Anthony Powell and Henry Yorke. He entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1923. He was prominent in the group later known as the Oxford Wits. He was part of the Hypocrites&#x27; Club that included Harold Acton, Lord David Cecil, L. P. Hartley and Evelyn Waugh.

At Oxford, Howard was part of the Railway Club, which included: Henry Yorke, Roy Harrod, Henry Thynne, 6th Marquess of Bath, David Plunket Greene, Harry Fox-Strangways, 7th Earl of Ilchester, Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse, John Sutro, Hugh Lygon, Harold Acton, Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, Mark Ogilvie-Grant, and John Drury-Lowe.

It has been suggested that Howard was Waugh&#x27;s model for Anthony Blanche in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. But Waugh wrote, to Lord Baldwin, &quot;There is an aesthetic bugger who sometimes turns up in my novels under various names—that was 2/3 Brian [Howard] and 1/3 Harold Acton. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard].&quot;

At this time he had already been published as a poet, in A. R. Orage&#x27;s &quot;The New Age&quot;, and the final Sitwell &quot;Wheels&quot; anthology. He used the pseudonyms &quot;Jasper Proude&quot; and &quot;Charles Orange.&quot; His verse also was in &quot;Oxford Poetry 1924&quot;. His poetry was admired and promoted by Edith Sitwell in the late 1920s.

In the late 1920s, he was a key figure among London&#x27;s &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;—a privileged, fashionable and bohemian set of relentless party-goers, satirised in such novels as Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1930 Vile Bodies where the character of Miles Malpractice owes something to Howard. Apart from Waugh, Howard knew this circle, including Nancy Mitford, Henry Yorke, Harold Acton, and especially Allanah Harper and Nancy Cunard. He maintained contact with both throughout his life.

In 1929, he was famously involved in the &quot;Bruno Hat&quot; hoax when the fashionable Hon Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bryan Guinness promoted a spoof London art exhibition by an apparently unknown German painter Bruno Hat (impersonated by the German-speaking Tom Mitford, brother of Nancy and Diana Mitford—the latter at the time Mrs. Guinness, a socialite, arts&#x27; patron and friend of Howard, Lytton Strachey, Evelyn Waugh, Boris Anrep, Dora Carrington, John Betjeman and other artistic and literary figures—before her second marriage to British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley). Bruno Hat&#x27;s paintings were the work of Brian Howard.

Howard is credited with coining the phrase, &quot;&quot;Anybody over the age of 30 seen in a bus has been a failure in life&quot;,&quot; often wrongly attributed to Margaret Thatcher. According to &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; correspondent and historian, Hugo Vickers, (writing in November 2006), the author was Brian Howard. The phrase came into wider use when used by Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, in her memoir &quot;Grace and Favour&quot; (1961).

Subsequently, he led a very active social life, tried to come to terms with his homosexuality, and published only one substantial poetry collection &quot;God Save the King&quot; (1930, Hours Press). He was active as a poet during the Spanish Civil War, but did not ultimately invest in his work with seriousness. He drank heavily and used drugs.

He had a long affair with Sandy Baird, whom he knew from Eton. Baird was killed in action in 1943 at 33 years old.

During World War II, Howard took part in the Dunkirk evacuation and later worked for MI5 but was dismissed from the War Office in June 1942, after which he was conscripted to the Royal Air Force and given a low-level clerk&#x27;s job at Bomber Command, High Wycombe. Transferred to another posting, where he referred to his commanding officer as &quot;Colonel Cutie&quot; (an appellation Evelyn Waugh gave his rebellious rogue Basil Seal in the novel &quot;Put Out More Flags&quot;), Howard was dismissed in December 1944, by which time he had formed a longstanding open relationship with Sam Langford, an Irishman serving in the Air Sea Rescue.

After the war, Howard drifted around Europe with Sam, continuing to write occasional articles and reviews for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the BBC and others, fitfully working on an uncompleted biography of the gay English writer Norman Douglas (author of the novel &quot;South Wind&quot;) and doing no substantial work. Because of drinking, drug use, and sexual indiscretions, they were expelled in turn from Monaco, France, Italy and Spain, the French authorities noting their &quot;moralité douteuse&quot; (dubious morality).

He suffered from bad health in the 1950s, and committed suicide by taking an overdose of sedatives after the death of his lover, Sam Langford (1926–1958), who died suddenly but naturally in Howard&#x27;s bath. They were buried alongside each other at Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice.

Evelyn Waugh wrote: &quot;I used to know Brian Howard well—a dazzling young man to my innocent eyes. In later life he became very dangerous—constantly attacking people with his fists in public places—so I kept clear of him. He was consumptive but the immediate cause of his death was a broken heart.&quot;

Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster wrote a biography of Howard. His long time friend Allanah Harper contributed useful anecdotes, but she objected to his being called a &quot;failure&quot; and to the emphasis on his homosexuality.

<doc id="1083113" wikidata="Q750286" url="?curid=1083113" title="The 69 Eyes">
<text>The 69 Eyes is a Finnish rock band. It was founded in 1989 in Helsinki by vocalist Jyrki 69 (who also writes the band&#x27;s lyrics), guitarists Bazie, Timo-Timo and bassist Archzie, joined in 1992 by drummer Jussi 69; the lineup never changed since then. The 69 Eyes music blends gothic rock with glam metal and rock &#x27;n roll in a style that was dubbed &quot;goth &#x27;n roll&quot;.

The 69 Eyes is currently signed to EMI Finland. The band&#x27;s albums are now distributed worldwide; The End Records acts as the band&#x27;s official North American distributor, as Nuclear Blast Records provides distribution in Europe. Australia will be handled by AmpHead Music. All Asian and Latin American releases are handled by EMI affiliates.

==History==
Formed in the bars of Helsinki in the summer of 1989 by Jyrki 69, Archzie (formerly of Syyskuu), Timo-Timo, Lotto and Bazie, The 69 Eyes originally had a glam metal style and were compared to other Finnish glam metal acts such as Smack and Hanoi Rocks. The band&#x27;s lineup has stayed the same since 1992 when drummer Jussi 69 replaced original drummer Lotto who had played on the band&#x27;s first two 7-inch vinyl singles.

The band released their first 7-inch EP, &quot;Sugarman&quot;, in 1990, followed by another 7-inch, &quot;Barbarella&quot;, in 1991. These are the only two releases that do not feature Jussi. These releases paved the way for the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bump &#x27;n&#x27; Grind&quot;, released in 1992, which contained some re-recorded versions of songs from the first two EPs. This same year, the band released their final two 7-inch EPs, &quot;Juicy Lucy&quot; and &quot;High Times Low Lives&quot;.

The band&#x27;s second CD, &quot;Motor City Resurrection&quot;, was released in 1994 via Japanese label 1+2 Records. It has since been re-released with eight bonus tracks worldwide. Though a compilation and not a full-length release (much like Hanoi Rocks&#x27; &quot;Self Destruction Blues&quot;), it collected the majority of the band&#x27;s early material and contributions to other compilations.
It was followed in 1995 by &quot;Savage Garden&quot; which featured Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy on the track &quot;Wild Talk&quot;.
Also released during this time were two VHS tapes &quot;Motor City Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Savage Tales&quot;, available only through the band&#x27;s self-run fan club (the aptly titled &quot;Get Down to 69&quot;).

1997 saw the release of &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot;, which fans generally mark as the last 69 Eyes &quot;glam-era&quot; album. The title track of this album was re-recorded for the &quot;Angels&quot; album 10 years later.
The goth rock-infused &quot;Wasting the Dawn&quot; was released in 1999 and was considered a milestone success for the band. It was released internationally on Roadrunner Records and marked the band&#x27;s major label debut. The album&#x27;s hit single, the title track &quot;Wasting the Dawn&quot;, lyrically paid tribute to The Doors&#x27; Jim Morrison and was released as a digipak CD single. Jyrki 69 developed a concept video for this track which featured longtime friend and collaborator Ville Valo posing at a snowy cemetery as the ghost of Jim Morrison. This video was released on DVD in Finland with a bonus behind-the-scenes feature and marked the band&#x27;s first music DVD released in the country.
Both the video and feature were later added as extras on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Helsinki Vampires&quot; DVD.

In early 2000, the band began working with producer Johnny Lee Michaels in Helsinki who would helm the band&#x27;s next four albums and contribute to the fifth.
Spring brought the single &quot;Gothic Girl&quot; which spent months on the Singles Top 10 and on Finnish nation radio playlists. It became the band&#x27;s first gold record. This single was a precursor to the sixth album, released in September 2000, &quot;Blessed Be&quot;, which rose to number 4 on the Finnish Album Charts and stayed in the top 10 for over a month. The album spawned four singles, the aforementioned &quot;Gothic Girl&quot;, &quot;Brandon Lee&quot;, &quot;The Chair&quot; and &quot;Stolen Season&quot;. Videos were filmed for the first three singles. After the release of &quot;Blessed Be&quot;, the band did their first short tour in Germany which included a show at the M&#x27;era Luna Festival. Support for the tour was Norwegian rock band Zeromancer.

In 2002, the band released &quot;Paris Kills&quot;, which would be known as their breakthrough album. It stayed for weeks as number 1 in Finland and went gold in a month of its release. It has since gone platinum. In Germany, it rose to number 35 in the first week. After touring Europe and Finland for months, a sold-out show at Helsinki&#x27;s famous Tavastia Club was filmed and documented in November 2002 for use in the &quot;Helsinki Vampires&quot; DVD.

At the end of 2003, The 69 Eyes signed to EMI Finland as they geared up to record &quot;Devils&quot;. The &quot;Lost Boys&quot; single was released in Finland at this time, paying homage to the film of the same name as anticipation for the full-length album grew.
2004 saw the release of &quot;Devils&quot;, their eighth album, to which they toured the UK in support of Wednesday 13. Once again the album was a success in their native Finland. It became the band&#x27;s fourth album to reach gold status and the second to reach number one position on the Finnish Top 40 album charts. It was released in Finland in October 2004 and in October 2005 in the U.S. through 456 Entertainment.

In 2005, The 69 Eyes played nearly a hundred shows around the world in fifteen countries, from Mexico to Japan. &quot;Devils&quot; was also released in the U.S. with an alternate cover from the international release. The band filmed their video &quot;Lost Boys&quot; in Hollywood and the Philadelphia area, directed by MTV star Bam Margera.

In March 2006, The 69 Eyes briefly toured the U.S. for the first time with Program the Dead and Damone, performing live on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; (episode dated 31 March 2006). This marked the band&#x27;s first ever U.S. television appearance.

&quot;Angels&quot;, the sequel to the 2004 album &quot;Devils&quot;, was released in Europe in March 2007. It debuted at number 1 in Finland and has since gone gold. Shortly after their tour with Cradle of Filth and 3 Inches of Blood, &quot;Angels&quot; was released on 25 June 2007 in the UK. The first single from the album was &quot;Perfect Skin&quot; which went straight to number 1 on the Finnish singles chart. The second single was &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. Videos were filmed for both singles and received international airplay.

The band did a summer 2007 US tour with Wednesday 13, Night Kills the Day and Fair to Midland, and supported Within Temptation on tour in the UK in November. They played 125 shows worldwide in 2007.
In 2008, the band released their first live album, titled &quot;The 69 Eyes: Hollywood Kills&quot;. It featured a complete live show recorded at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood in March 2006. The performance featured hits spanning the six latest albums an introduction by Bam Margera and a live cover of the Ramones&#x27; &quot;I Just Wanna Have Something to Do&quot;. The concert was also filmed in its entirety. Five tracks from the performance were released on DVD as bonus content on the &quot;Angels/Devils&quot; box set and the entire concert was released on the &quot;Back in Blood&quot; bonus DVD.

The band began 2009 by touring in Europe as a part of Hellhounds Festival with Tiamat and Ava Inferi. In early 2009, The 69 Eyes started initial recording for their ninth studio album with producer Matt Hyde. The recording process took place in Los Angeles. It was also revealed that Johnny Lee Michaels provided post-production work in Helsinki.

The new album &quot;Back in Blood&quot; was released 28 August in Europe and 15 September in the USA. In early June 2009, Bam Margera directed the music video for the first single from the album, &quot;Dead Girls Are Easy&quot;. The video premiered on playboy.com on 17 July 2009. The 69 Eyes also toured Australia for the first time in mid-June, playing in Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney. A tour of the United States followed in October 2009, and Jyrki 69 was featured on both Fox News&#x27; &quot;Red Eye&quot; program as well as on CNN International. In December 2009, the band debuted their newest video for the song, &quot;Dead &amp; Gone&quot;, via Myspace. This new video marked the band&#x27;s third collaboration with Bam Margera. On 10 August, the band revealed a contest for fans to create a video for the next single, &quot;Kiss Me Undead&quot;, and on 30 September the band posted their 14 favorite videos on their YouTube page.

In April 2010, during an interview with Sean Twisted of Renegaderadio.net, Rudi Protrudi (frontman and founder of The Fuzztones) reported he had completed work on a new song with The 69 Eyes, although further details were unavailable during that time.

On the official The 69 Eyes webpage the band&#x27;s reported a European tour with Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet in March and April 2011.

Early in 2012, The 69 Eyes began recording their next studio album &quot;X&quot;, which was released on 28 September 2012 across Europe and on 9 October 2012 in the United States. The first single from the album was &quot;Red&quot; and featured a music video. The second single was &quot;Borderline&quot;. Both singles were available before the album was released in Europe. In February 2013, the band released the singles &quot;Love Runs Away&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; simultaneously via iTunes. &quot;Tonight&quot; was released exclusively in Finland while &quot;Love Runs Away&quot; was released everywhere else. Both singles included two previously unreleased tracks, &quot;Rosary Blue&quot; and &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Castle&quot;, the latter being the song Rudi Protrudi reported he had co-written with The 69 Eyes back in 2010.

The 69 Eyes released a double-CD compilation of their radio hit singles called &quot;The Best of Helsinki Vampires&quot; in November 2013. The compilation also included a new single, &quot;Lost Without Love&quot;.
On 29 July 2015, the band announced that they were working on a new album with producer Johnny Lee Michaels in Helsinki. Michaels previously worked with the band on four consecutive albums (&quot;Blessed Be&quot;, &quot;Paris Kills&quot;, &quot;Devils&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot;). The new album was set to be released in early 2016. They also announced the first single &quot;Jet Fighter Plane&quot; to be released on 15 January 2016. The second single &quot;Dolce Vita&quot; was released on 8 April 2016. Both singles had music videos directed by Ville Juurikkala. 

The album titled &quot;Universal Monsters&quot; was released on 22 April 2016. The third single was announced to be &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and was released with a music video on 13 May 2016.

On 17 April 2019, the band began their first tour in the United States since 2009, ahead of the release of their upcoming album. The tour ended on 18 May in Philadelphia, making them the last national act scheduled to play at The Trocadero prior to its closure.

On 25 May 2019, The 69 Eyes announced they were to release their twelfth studio album, &quot;West End&quot;, on Friday the 13th of September 2019 via Nuclear Blast. Jyrki 69 gave a few details about the new record, saying &quot;I feel like this planet is on some turning point. The end of the western world is near and the question is: What is happening when the west ends..? The title has multiple meanings for us… but be assured it has definitely nothing to do with The Pet Shop Boys or London.&quot; &quot;The track deals with the idea of Hollywood and everyone coming there to make their dreams come true, but it&#x27;s very seldom that they succeed and this is something you can see there everywhere&quot;, Jyrki 69 contemplates. &quot;It&#x27;s a place that makes you desperate and I wanted to get these dark vibes into the song. But on the other hand the track is also a celebration of life – we should be excited to be here and everybody&#x27;s a legend and they should realise that we should enjoy what we do instead of worry what other people think.&quot; The 69 Eyes also released a behind-the-scenes video showing the recording of the record.

In February 2022, The 69 Eyes announced that they had signed to Atomic Fire Records, and two months later, they released their first song in three years, &quot;Drive&quot;. Later that year, the band released two more songs: &quot;Call Me Snake&quot; and &quot;California&quot;, the former being inspired by John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and the latter having a music video accompanying its release. Both songs were included in the &quot;Drive&quot; EP that same year. 

In March 2023, the music video for the single &quot;Death of Darkness&quot; was released. Jyrki 69 commented, &quot;&#x27;Death Of Darkness&#x27; is a song about love. Love leads us to the light. Very simple. It sounds like it was written some twenty-five years ago. It&#x27;s melancholic goth rock like we knew it in 2001.&quot; The studio album &quot;Death of Darkness&quot; was released April 21, 2023.

Eleven months later, The 69 Eyes collaborated with American songwriter Diane Warren and released the power balled &quot;Fade To Grey&quot; on March 22, 2024.

==Musical style==
Initially, the 69 Eyes&#x27; music style was of glam metal influenced by acts such as Mötley Crüe and Hanoi Rocks. However, they began to incorporate more influence from gothic rock bands such as the Mission, the Cult, the Sisters of Mercy and the Lords of the New Church. Their sound was described as a mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Their music continued to show further influence from other rock artists such as the Doors, Elvis Presley and Billy Idol as well as vampire films and literature. The term &quot;goth &#x27;n roll&quot; is used by fans to describe their style. They are often described as a dark rock band, a term which the band has embraced. In recent times, with the release of &quot;Back in Blood&quot;, they have moved back to a more guitar-based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.

The 69 Eyes lyrics are often inspired by movies, especially gothic, horror, western and mystery films such as &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; and &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, among many others. According to Jyrki, &quot;half of The 69 Eyes songs are wannabe movie songs&quot;.

<doc id="1083117" wikidata="Q5953091" url="?curid=1083117" title="Hybrid Graphics">
<text>Hybrid Graphics Ltd., commonly referred to as Hybrid Graphics, was a graphics software technology company active from 1994 to 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. Acquired by Nvidia in 2006, Hybrid Graphics is now Nvidia Corporation&#x27;s Helsinki office.

== History ==
Until the year 2000, Hybrid was widely known for its middleware solutions for computer games. Hybrid&#x27;s other business sector was image-making using 3D graphics, this operation was spun off in 2004 as Fake Graphics Ltd. The company&#x27;s most important product of that time was the OpenGL based graphics library SurRender 3D (1996–2000). In 2000 Hybrid launched the dPVS (dynamic Potentially Visible Set) visibility optimization middleware that is used in many MMORPGs, including Star Wars Galaxies and EverQuest II. In 2006 the dPVS technology was acquired by Umbra Software Ltd.

Hybrid Graphics provided the first commercial implementations of the OpenGL ES and OpenVG mobile graphics APIs, and was actively involved in the development of the M3G (JSR-184) Java standard, in the context of the Khronos Group and Java Community Process, respectively. Hybrid also sponsored academic research on computer graphics, including multiple papers published in SIGGRAPH.

<text>Henry Monroe &quot;Hank&quot; Beachell (September 21, 1906 – December 13, 2006) was an American plant breeder. His research led to the development of hybrid rice cultivars that saved millions of people around the world from starvation.

Born in Waverly, Nebraska, Beachell and his family moved to a corn and wheat farm in western Nebraska. In 1930 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degegree in agronomy from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he was a member of the FarmHouse fraternity. After obtaining a Master&#x27;s degree at Kansas State University, Beachell worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Texas. There, he created nine rice varieties, which eventually accounted for more than 90 percent of the U.S. long-grain rice production. He went to International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in 1963 after his retirement from the DOA. He created a high-yielding rice variety IR8 in 1964, based on the previous work by Peter Jennings (no relations to the US journalists). IR8 was officially released by IRRI in 1966. It dramatically increased the yields of Asian rice from 1 or 2 ton per hectare to 4 or 5 tons per hectare. It played a significant part in the Green Revolution.

Beachell has been called the most important person in rice improvement in the world. As farmers planted higher yielding rice, nutrition improved in many Asian countries, and farmers increased their incomes. Beachell was awarded a honorary doctorate from the University of Nebraska in 1972. Beachell has received many international awards, including the 1987 Japan Prize and 1996 World Food Prize. As a centenarian, Beachell consulted with RiceTec, the only commercial hybrid rice-breeding program in the U.S, up until his death.

<doc id="1083121" wikidata="Q421978" url="?curid=1083121" title="Enterotoxin">
<text>An enterotoxin is a protein exotoxin released by a microorganism that targets the intestines. They can be chromosomally or plasmid encoded. They are heat labile (&gt; 60 °C), of low molecular weight and water-soluble. Enterotoxins are frequently cytotoxic and kill cells by altering the apical membrane permeability of the mucosal (epithelial) cells of the intestinal wall. They are mostly pore-forming toxins (mostly chloride pores), secreted by bacteria, that assemble to form pores in cell membranes. This causes the cells to die.

== Clinical significance ==

Enterotoxins have a particularly marked effect upon the gastrointestinal tract, causing traveler&#x27;s diarrhea and food poisoning. The action of enterotoxins leads to increased chloride ion permeability of the apical membrane of intestinal mucosal cells. These membrane pores are activated either by increased cAMP or by increased calcium ion concentration intracellularly. The pore formation has a direct effect on the osmolarity of the luminal contents of the intestines. Increased chloride permeability leads to leakage into the lumen followed by sodium and water movement. This leads to a secretory diarrhea within a few hours of ingesting enterotoxin. Several microbial organisms contain the necessary enterotoxin to create such an effect, such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;.

The drug linaclotide, used to treat some forms of constipation, is based on the mechanism of enterotoxins.

== Classification and 3D structures ==

=== Bacterial ===

Enterotoxins can be formed by the bacterial pathogens &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; and can cause Staphylococcal Food Poisoning and &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; diarrheal disease, respectively. Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal exotoxins constitute a family of biologically and structurally related pyrogenic superantigens. 25 staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), mainly produced by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, have been identified to date and named alphabetically (SEA – SEZ). It has been suggested that &quot;staphylococci&quot; other than &quot;S. aureus&quot; can contribute to Staphylococcal Food Poisoning by forming enterotoxins. Streptococcal exotoxins are produced by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. These toxins share the ability to bind to the major histocompatibility complex proteins of their hosts. A more distant relative of the family is the &quot;S. aureus &quot;toxic shock syndrome toxin, which shares only a low level of sequence similarity with this group.

All of these toxins share a similar two-domain fold (N and C-terminal domains) with a long alpha-helix in the middle of the molecule, a characteristic beta-barrel known as the &quot;oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold&quot; at the N-terminal domain and a beta-grasp motif at the C-terminal domain. An example is staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Each superantigen possesses slightly different binding mode(s) when it interacts with MHC class II molecules or the T-cell receptor.

The beta-grasp domain has some structural similarities to the beta-grasp motif present in immunoglobulin-binding domains, ubiquitin, 2Fe-2 S ferredoxin and translation initiation factor 3 as identified by the SCOP database.

* &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; (Clostridium enterotoxin)
* &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; (Cholera toxin)
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (Staphylococcal enterotoxin B)
* &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;
* &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot; (Shiga toxin)

=== Viral ===

Viruses in the families &quot;Reoviridae&quot;, &quot;Caliciviridae&quot;, and &quot;Astroviridae&quot; are responsible for a huge percentage of gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Rotaviruses (of &quot;Reoviridae&quot;) have been found to contain an enterotoxin which plays a role in viral pathogenesis. NSP4, is a protein that is made during the intracellular phase of the virion&#x27;s life cycle and is known to have a primary function in intracellular virion maturation. However, when NSP4 from group A Rotaviruses was purified (4 alleles tested), concentrated, and injected into a mouse model, diarrheal disease mimicking that caused by Rotavirus infection commenced. A putative mode of toxicity is that NSP4 activates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in an increased cellular concentration of calcium and subsequent chloride secretion from the cell. Secretion of ions from villi lining the gut alter normal osmotic pressures and prevent uptake of water, eventually causing diarrhea.

<doc id="1083128" wikidata="Q284027" url="?curid=1083128" title="Dzungaria">
<text>Dzungaria (; from the Mongolian words , meaning &#x27;left hand&#x27;), also known as Northern Xinjiang or Beijiang, is a geographical subregion in Northwest China that corresponds to the northern half of Xinjiang. Bound by the Altai Mountains to the north and the Tian Shan mountain range to the south, Dzungaria covers approximately , and borders Kazakhstan to the west and Mongolia to the east. In contexts prior to the mid-18th century Dzungar genocide, the term &quot;Dzungaria&quot; could cover a wider area, coterminous with the Oirat-led Dzungar Khanate.

Although Dzungaria is geographically, historically, and ethnically distinct from the Tarim Basin or Southern Xinjiang (Nanjiang), the Manchu-led Qing dynasty integrated both areas into one province, Xinjiang. Dzungaria is Xinjiang&#x27;s center of heavy industry, generates most of the region&#x27;s GDP, and houses its political capital Ürümqi (Oirat for &#x27;beautiful pasture&#x27;). As such, Dzungaria continues to attract intraprovincial and interprovincial migration to its cities. In contrast to the Tarim Basin, Dzungaria is relatively well integrated with the rest of China by rail and trade links.

== Background ==
Xinjiang has traditionally been divided into two geographically and ethnically distinct regions: Dzungaria, located north of the Tian Shan mountains; and the Tarim Basin, located south of the mountains. At the time of the Qing conquest of Xinjiang in 1759, Dzungaria was predominantly inhabited by steppe-dwelling, nomadic Tibetan-Buddhist Dzungars while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by predominantly oasis-dwelling, sedentary, Turkic Muslim farmers, now known as the Uyghurs. The Qing government was well aware of the differences between the inhabitants of the two regions, and initially ruled them as separate administrative units. However, after the Qing army&#x27;s final pacification of the Tarim Basin in 1760, the Qing government began to describe Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin as one region called &quot;Xinjiang&quot; ().

The Qing government officially unified Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin into one political entity called Xinjiang Province in 1884, despite protests by some officials who believed that the two regions were better off left separated. The geographic concept of Xinjiang was ultimately a construct of the Qing government; by the end of Qing rule in 1912, Xinjiang&#x27;s native inhabitants had still not developed a distinct regional identity. However, the foundations for a regional identity were laid by the Qing government&#x27;s 150-year-long policies of politically isolating Xinjiang from the rest of Central Asia and introducing Han and Hui settlers into the region. These policies pushed forward a cultural identity which sharply contrasted with both the rest of China and the rest of Central Asia.

==History==
Before the 21st century, all or part of the region has been ruled or controlled by the Xiongnu Empire, Han dynasty, Xianbei state, Rouran Khaganate, Turkic Khaganate, Tang dynasty, Uyghur Khaganate, Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate, Liao dynasty, Kara-Khitan Khanate, Mongol Empire, Yuan dynasty, Chagatai Khanate, Moghulistan, Kara Del, Northern Yuan, Four Oirat, Dzungar Khanate, Qumul Khanate, Qing dynasty, the Republic of China, the Second East Turkestan Republic and since 1950, it has been under the control of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Etymology ===
Dzungaria is named after the Dzungar Khanate that existed in Central Asia during the 17th and 18th centuries.

&quot;Dzungaria&quot;, or &quot;Zungharia&quot;, derives from the name of the Dzungar people, which comes from the Mongolian term &quot;Zűn Gar&quot;, or &quot;Jüün Gar&quot; (depending on the Mongolian dialect used). &quot;Zűn&quot; (or &quot;Jüün&quot;) means &#x27;left&#x27; and &quot;Gar&quot; means &#x27;hand&#x27;. The name originates from the notion that the Western Mongols (Oirats) were on the left-hand side when the Mongol Empire began its division into East and West Mongols. After this fragmentation, the western Mongolian nation was called &quot;Zuun Gar&quot;.

=== Pre-modern era ===
The first people to inhabit the region were Indo-European-speaking peoples such as the Tocharians in prehistory and the Jushi Kingdom in the first millennium BC.

One of the earliest mentions of the Dzungaria region occurs when the Han dynasty dispatched an explorer to investigate lands to the west, using the northernmost Silk Road trackway of about in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of Xi&#x27;an to the west over the Wushao Ling Pass to Wuwei and emerged in Kashgar.

Istämi of the Göktürks received the lands of Dzungaria as an inheritance after the death of his father in the latter half of the sixth century AD.

Dzungar power reached its height in the second half of the 17th century, when Galdan Boshugtu Khan repeatedly intervened in the affairs of the Kazakhs to the west, but it was completely destroyed by the Qing Empire about 1757–1759. It has played an important part in the history of Mongolia and the great migrations of Mongolian stems westward. Its widest limit included Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, the whole region of the Tian Shan, and the greater proportion of that part of Central Asia which extends from 35° to 50° N and from 72° to 97° E.

After 1761, its territory fell mostly to the Qing dynasty during the campaign against the Dzungars (Xinjiang and north-western Mongolia) and partly to Russian Turkestan (the earlier Kazakh state provinces of Zhetysu and Irtysh river).

====Dzungaria and the Silk Road====
A traveler going west from China must go either north of the Tian Shan mountains through Dzungaria or south of the mountains through the Tarim Basin. Trade usually took the south side and migrations the north. This is most likely because the Tarim leads to the Ferghana Valley and Iran, while Dzungaria leads only to the open steppe. The difficulty with the south side was the high mountains between the Tarim and Ferghana. Furthermore, the Taklamakan is too dry to support much grass, and therefore nomads when they are not robbing caravans. Its inhabitants live mostly in oases formed where rivers run out of the mountains into the desert. These are inhabited by peasants who are unwarlike and merchants who have an interest in keeping trade running smoothly. Dzungaria has a fair amount of grass, few towns to base soldiers in and no significant mountain barriers to the west. Therefore, trade went south and migrations north. Today most trade is north of the mountains (Dzungarian Gate and Khorgas in the Ili valley) to avoid the mountains west of the Tarim and because Russia is currently more developed.

=== Modern era ===
After the Dzungar genocide, the Qing subsequently began to repopulate the area with Han and Hui people from China proper.

The population in the 21st century consists of Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Mongols, Uyghurs and Han Chinese. Since 1953, northern Xinjiang has attracted skilled workers from all over China—who have mostly been Han Chinese—to work on water conservation and industrial projects, especially the Karamay oil fields. Intraprovincial migration has mostly been directed towards Dzungaria also, with immigrants from the poor Uyghur areas of southern Xinjiang flooding to the provincial capital of Ürümqi to find work.

As a political or geographical term, &quot;Dzungaria&quot; has practically disappeared from the map; but the range of mountains stretching north-east along the southern frontier of the Zhetysu, as the district to the southeast of Lake Balkhash preserves the name of Dzungarian Alatau. It also gave name to Djungarian hamsters.

==Geography==


Wheat, barley, oats, and sugar beets are grown, and cattle, sheep, and horses are raised in Dzungaria. The fields are irrigated with melted snow from the permanently white-capped mountains. Dzungaria has deposits of coal, gold, and iron, as well as large oil fields.

===Dzungarian Basin===
The core of Dzungaria is the triangular Dzungarian Basin, also known as Junggar Basin (), with its central Gurbantünggüt Desert. It is bounded by the Tarbagatai Mountains to the northwest, the Altai Mountains to the northeast, and the Tian Shan mountains to the south. The three corners are relatively open. The northern corner is the valley of the upper Irtysh River. The western corner is the Dzungarian Gate, a historically important gateway between Dzungaria and the Kazakh Steppe; presently, a highway and a railway (opened in 1990) run through it, connecting China with Kazakhstan. The eastern corner of the basin leads to Gansu and the rest of China. In the south, an easy pass leads from Ürümqi to the Turfan Depression. In the southwest, the tall Borohoro Mountains branch of the Tian Shan separates the basin from the upper Ili River.

The basin is similar to the larger Tarim Basin on the southern side of the Tian Shan Range. Only a gap in the mountains to the north allows moist air masses to provide the basin lands with enough moisture to remain semi-desert rather than becoming a true desert like most of the Tarim Basin and allows a thin layer of vegetation to grow. This is enough to sustain populations of wild camels, jerboas, and other wild species.

The Dzungarian Basin is a structural basin with thick sequences of Paleozoic-Pleistocene rocks with large estimated oil reserves. The Gurbantunggut Desert, China&#x27;s second largest, is in the center of the basin.

The Dzungarian basin does not have a single catchment center. The northernmost section of Dzungaria is part of the basin of the Irtysh River, which ultimately drains into the Arctic Ocean. The rest of the region is split into a number of endorheic basins. In particular, south of the Irtysh, the Ulungur River ends up in the (presently) endorheic Lake Ulungur. The Southwestern part of the Dzungarian basin drains into the 
Aibi Lake. In the west-central part of the region, streams flow into (or toward) a group of endorheic lakes that include Lake Manas and Lake Ailik. During the region&#x27;s geological past, a much larger lake (the &quot;Old Manas Lake&quot;) was located in the area of today&#x27;s Manas Lake; it was fed not only by the streams that presently flow toward it but also by the Irtysh and Ulungur, which too were flowing toward the Old Manas Lake at the time.

The cold climate of nearby Siberia influences the climate of the Dzungarian Basin, making the temperature colder—as low as —and providing more precipitation, ranging from , compared to the warmer, drier basins to the south. Runoff from the surrounding mountains into the basin supplies several lakes. The ecologically rich habitats traditionally included meadows, marshlands, and rivers. However, most of the land is now used for agriculture.

It is a largely steppe and semi-desert basin surrounded by high mountains: the Tian Shan (ancient Mount Imeon) in the south and the Altai in the north. Geologically it is an extension of the Paleozoic Kazakhstan Block and was once part of an independent continent before the Altai mountains formed in the late Paleozoic. It does not contain the abundant minerals of Kazakhstan and may have been a pre-existing continental block before the Kazakhstan Block was formed.

Ürümqi, Yining and Karamai are the main cities; other smaller oasis towns dot the piedmont areas.

==Ecology==
Dzungaria is home to a semi-desert steppe ecoregion known as the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert. The vegetation consists mostly of low scrub of &quot;Anabasis brevifolia&quot;. Taller shrublands of saxaul bush &quot;(Haloxylon ammodendron)&quot; and &quot;Ephedra przewalskii&quot; can be found near the margins of the basin. Streams descending from the Tian Shan and Altai ranges support stands of poplar &quot;(Populus diversifolia)&quot; together with &quot;Nitraria roborovsky, N. sibirica, Neotrinia splendens,&quot; tamarisk &quot;(Tamarix sibirimosissima)&quot;, and willow &quot;(Salix ledebouriana)&quot;.

The northeastern portion of the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert lies within Great Gobi National Park, and is home to herds of Onagers &quot;(Equus hemionus)&quot;, goitered gazelles &quot;(Gazella subgutturosa)&quot; and Wild Bactrian camels &quot;(Camelus ferus)&quot;.

The basin was one of the last habitats of Przewalski&#x27;s horse &quot;(Equus przewalskii)&quot;, also known as Dzungarian horse, which was once extinct in the wild, though it has since been reintroduced in areas of Mongolia and China.

===Paleontology===
Dzungaria and its derivatives are used to name a number of pre-historic animals, hailing from the rocky outcrops located in the Dzungar Basin:
*&quot;Dsungaripterus weii&quot; (pterosaur)
*&quot;Junggarsuchus sloani&quot; (crocodylomorph)

A notable find, in February 2006, is the oldest tyrannosaur fossil unearthed by a team of scientists from George Washington University who were conducting a study in the Dzungarian Basin. The species, named &quot;Guanlong&quot;, lived 160 million years ago, more than 90 million years before the famed &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;.

<text>Road Rash 3D is a racing video game developed and published by Electronic Arts exclusively for the PlayStation.

==Gameplay==
The game plays similarly to previous games developed in the &quot;Road Rash&quot; series, which involves the player racing their motorcycle against other motorcyclists. Gameplay favors an arcade-like style, with little emphasis on realism. While racing, the player has the option of punching, or using weapons to attack other opponents, to slow down their progress. The ultimate goal is to place first in the race in order to earn money to upgrade the player&#x27;s motorcycle. Conversely, the worst scenarios are to finish last, which does not earn money, or be stopped by police officers, which actually loses money. Despite sharing many characteristics with past games in the series, &quot;Road Rash 3D&quot; puts a stronger emphasis on the racing aspect of the game, and less on combat.

The individual courses for the game are pieced together from a larger system of interconnected grids of roads. Courses may overlap common segments of other tracks, but often have different start or end points, or have the player turning down alternate routes. While the player can opt to take the wrong route, taking them very far typically results in hitting &quot;invisible walls&quot; that restrict further movement in the given direction.

==Music==
Thanks to a licensing agreement with Atlantic Records, the game featured music from bands such as Sugar Ray, Kid Rock, CIV, The Mermen, Full on the Mouth, and The Tea Party. Sugar Ray contributed three songs, &quot;Speed Home California&quot;, &quot;Tap, Twist, Snap&quot; and &quot;Mean Machine&quot;, as well as short track &quot;The Club&quot;.

==Development==
The biker animations were created using motion capture, with the motion capture actors perched on motorcycle mock-ups.

A PC version with LAN enabled multiplayer and support for force feedback joysticks was planned, but never released.

==Reception==
&quot;Road Rash 3D&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. The most common complaint was that the game failed to live up to the prior games in the series on the Sega Genesis and 3DO, especially that it lacked a two-player multiplayer mode. &quot;Edge&quot; highlighted the game&#x27;s network of interconnecting roads, &quot;impressive&quot; 3D engine, and track design, but criticized the execution of combat moves for being unresponsive and impractical, saying that they require precise timing and a significant degree of luck. &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that despite having some flaws in the gameplay, they considered it a worthy installment in the series.

In a mixed review, &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game for its graphical glitches, and for the fact that the game reduced the actual combat aspect of the gameplay that the series had been known for in prior iterations. &quot;IGN&quot; complained that despite two to three years of development time, that the game managed to control worse, and play slower, than the series&#x27; last release on the 3DO. &quot;AllGame&quot; echoed these sentiments, questioning the game&#x27;s slow pace, graphical glitches, and overall lower quality than the prior game for the 3DO. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; referred to it as &quot;one of the worst motorcycle games...ever&quot; and summarized that the game did not come close to its predecessors regarding its gameplay. &quot;Next Generation&quot; was generally critical to gameplay and graphics and gave it a score 2 stars out of 5.

&quot;Road Rash 3D&quot; won the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music&quot; award at AIAS&#x27; 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards and was a finalist for &quot;8th Annual GamePro Readers&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; for &quot;Best Racing Game of The Year&quot;, but lost to &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;.

==Response and legacy==
The game&#x27;s lack of multiplayer and lack of emphasis on combat was frequently cited as a shortcoming of the game by critics. Electronic Arts representatives defended the lack of multiplayer, stating that the feature was impossible due to the way game data was streamed from the game disc. Such concerns were addressed in subsequent future releases. A year later, on September 27, 1999, &quot;Road Rash 64&quot; was released. While it was initially thought to be a simple port of the game for the Nintendo 64, the end product turned out to be a major reworking of the game, putting a greater emphasis on combat, and including several multiplayer modes with support to up to four players. Additionally, the next game in the series, &quot;Road Rash: Jailbreak&quot;, especially focused gameplay on a two player cooperative mode where a second player can join in on a motorcycle&#x27;s side car.

<text>The Keene Sentinel is an independently owned daily newspaper published in Keene, New Hampshire. It currently publishes six days a week.

The &quot;Sentinel&quot; is the fifth oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States, having operated under the &quot;Sentinel&quot; name since its founding, by John Prentiss, in March 1799 as the &quot;New Hampshire Sentinel&quot;. It was preceded in Keene by a number of much shorter ventures, including &quot;The New Hampshire Recorder&quot;, &quot;The Cheshire Advertiser&quot;, &quot;The Columbian Informer&quot;, and &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;.

==History==
On March 23, 1799, first issue of the &quot;New Hampshire Sentinel&quot;, a weekly paper was published by the owner, John Prentiss. He was just 21 years old when he began the paper. The newspaper would stay under the Prentiss family guidance until 1954.

From 1799 through 1847, John Prentiss published the weekly himself, until 1819, when his brother joined him for a period of two years. His son, John William Prentiss worked with him from 1828 until leaving in 1834, however, he returned in 1838 and they named their enterprise, J &amp; J.W. Prentiss.

In 1847, John Prentiss retired and his son, John William Prentiss hired Albert Godfrey as a partner. John William retired in 1850, due to poor health. Godfrey, George S. Woodward and Samuel Woodward took ownership of the paper until 1856, when Samuel Woodward sold his ownership to Thomas Hale and Thomas C. Rand, with the stipulation that they merge &quot;American News&quot; with the &quot;Keene Sentinel&quot;, Woodward having ownership of &quot;American&quot;.

During the period between 1865 and 1872, there were some questions about ownership of the &quot;Sentinel&quot; and Clement J. Woodward purchased the holdings of O.I. French and George Ticknor, sometime around 1860. A large interest in the paper had been purchased by George Ticknor, who edited it until his death in 1866.

In 1880, the founders grandson, William H. Prentiss, became part owner and worked as city editor. In 1893, they incorporated, and Bertram Ellis, William Prentiss, Thomas Rand and Samuel Woodward became stockholders. In 1897, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; became a member of the Associated Press. Rand and Ellis sold their shares in 1912 and 1918, respectively.

In 1923, when William H. Prentiss died, he and Samuel Woodward had equal shares in the company. His wife, inherited the shares. In 1930, they built a brick building located at 60 West Street, where they published the &quot;Keene Evening Sentinel,&quot; a daily newspaper; the first issue was published on May 21, 1930. 
In 1935, on the passing of Mrs. William H. Prentiss, her ownership passed on to her son, John W. Prentiss, great-grandson of founder, John Prentiss. In 1927, Woodward died, his shares passing to his son, Paul, and John Prentiss becoming president. In 1945, Paul Woodward sold his shares to John E. Coffin. Coffin and Prentiss co-owned the Sentinel until Prentiss died in 1953.

In October, 1954, James D. Ewing, his wife Ruth, and business partner, Walter Paine, purchased the Sentinel, from Coffin, and the Prentiss family. In 1957, the daily &quot;New Hampshire Sentinel&quot;, was merged with the daily &quot;Keene Evening Sentinel&quot;. Later, Paine sold his interest in the paper to the Ewings. They ran &quot;The Keene Sentinel&quot;, (named &quot;The Keene Sentinel&quot;, from 1972 to present) until retiring, in 1993, selling the paper to their nephew, Thomas (Tom) Ewing. Thomas Ewing still retains ownership of the Sentinel.

==Awards==

* At the 2009 New England Associated Press News Executives Association, the &quot;Sentinel&quot; won more awards for photography, design and news writing than any other newspaper. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; won 19 awards, including eight first-place honors. The &quot;Sentinel&quot; has repeatedly won awards from state and regional press associations, including 12 awards from the N.H. press association in 2014.

Former editorial writer Guy MacMillin won the Allan B. Rogers Award for the best local editorial in New England by newspapers of any size.

Under the leadership of James Ewing, the &quot;Keene Sentinel&quot; received the following awards.

* 1961 the paper received honorable mention in the Svellon Brown Awards, for meritorious and distinguished service to its public, by the New England Newspaper and Press Association.
* 1987 Yankee Quill Award, Society of Professional Journalists, for outstanding contributions to New England journalism.
* New Hampshire Award from the New Hampshire Press Association.

==Current operations==
The daily operation includes the online service SentinelSource and commercial printing operations. As of 2004, it had a paid circulation of about 14,000.

In May 2024, the newspaper sent out a memo to staff announcing it will switch to postal delivery, resulting in 11 independent carriers losing their jobs. In January 2025, the paper launched the &quot;The Keene Sentinel Local Journalism Fund&quot; along with a community advisory board.

The &quot;Sentinel&quot; covers the city of Keene, and 30 towns in Cheshire County (Alstead, Chesterfield, Dublin, Fitzwilliam, Gilsum, Harrisville, Hinsdale, Jaffrey, Marlborough, Marlow, Nelson, Richmond, Rindge, Roxbury, Stoddard, Sullivan, Surry, Swanzey, Troy, Walpole, Westmoreland, and Winchester), Hillsborough County (Antrim, Bennington, Francestown, Greenfield, Hancock, and Peterborough) and Sullivan County (Acworth, Charlestown, and Langdon).

==Prices==
&quot;The Keene Sentinel&quot; prices are: $2.00 daily, and $2.75 for the “Weekend Edition”.

<doc id="1083141" wikidata="Q469551" url="?curid=1083141" title="Riane Eisler">
<text>Riane Tennenhaus Eisler (born July 22, 1931) is an Austrian-born American systems scientist, futurist, attorney, and author who writes about the effect of gender and family politics historically on societies, and vice versa. She is best known for her 1987 book, &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot;, in which she coined the terms &quot;partnership&quot; and &quot;dominator&quot;.

She has written and been interviewed in over 500 articles. Her work is covered in publications ranging from &quot;Scientific American, Behavioral Science, Futures, Political Psychology, The Christian Science Monitor, Challenge, and UNESCO Courier to Brain and Mind, Human Rights Quarterly, International Journal of Women&#x27;s Studies, and World Encyclopedia of Peace,&quot; as well as chapters for books published by trade and university presses (e.g., Cambridge, Stanford, and Oxford University).

Eisler pioneered the expansion of human rights theory and action to include the majority of humanity: women and children.

Her research provides a new perspective on our past, present, and possibilities for the future, including a new social and political agenda for building a more humane and environmentally sustainable world.

Her newest works draw from social and biological science, especially neuroscience, showing the interconnection between childhood/families, gender, economics, and story/language as cornerstones of either partnership-oriented or domination-oriented social systems.

Eisler&#x27;s multi-disciplinary whole-systems analysis highlights how traditions of domination underlie current crises, as well as how to move to a more equitable, sustainable, and caring world.

==Life==
Eisler was born in Vienna in 1931 before her family fled from the Nazis in 1939 to Cuba. She and her parents lived in a slum in Havana for seven years, after which they emigrated to the United States, to Miami, New York, and Chicago before finally settling in Los Angeles.

Eisler has degrees in sociology and law from the University of California. She is an attorney, legal scholar, systems scientist, and author. She has published thirteen books, including one memoir, &quot;The Gate,&quot; published in 2000. Her first book, published in 1977, was &quot;Dissolution: No-Fault Divorce, Marriage, and the Future of Women&quot;. Her second book, published in 1979, was on the Equal Rights Amendment.

Drawing on ten years of multidisciplinary research, in her third book &quot;The Chalice and the Blade (&quot;originally published in 1987) she coined the terms &quot;partnership&quot; and &quot;dominator&quot; to describe two underlying forms of society. These forms transcend conventional social categories like right/left, religious/secular, Eastern/Western, capitalist/socialist, etc.

Partnership-oriented societies are characterized by peace, equity, gender equality, sustainability, and caring. Dominator-oriented societies are characterized by sexism and other forms of in-group versus out-group rankings such as racism and anti-Semitism, as well as chronic war, ecological destruction, and unsustainability.

Eisler&#x27;s research references the work of archaeologists Marija Gimbutas and Ian Hodder, anthropologists Douglas Fry, and many others. It shows that for millennia most human societies were built on a partnership-oriented structure. This meant society supported the human capacity to give, nurture, and sustain life. Caregiving was held in the highest regard. Shared responsibility and caring were the gold standard. According to archaeology, the fall into domination occurred between five and ten thousand years ago. This was a drop in the evolutionary bucket, as Eisler notes.

&quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; has sold over 500,000 copies and been translated into around 30 languages.

Eisler&#x27;s research indicates that the switch from partnership to domination led to a shift from in-group versus out-group attitudes. Group hierarchy and relationships were now based on factors such as sex, race, and other differences. Violence was ultimately the basis for maintaining these hierarchies, and was built into the system. The “conquest of nature,” massive inequality, and devaluing the work of caring for people started to become common practice. The work of caring for our natural life-support systems was also undervalued, taken for granted, and removed from the money economy.

Domination systems normalize violence - from abusive authoritarian families, to the promotion of violence in modern politics, to destructive warfare between nations. Violence became a means to maintain power-over others as a social norm.

Eisler is currently the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies&quot; at the University of Minnesota. She is a keynote speaker at conferences worldwide. She also heads the Center for Partnership Systems - a vast resource library of research that can empower anyone in creating a more partnership-oriented world.

==The Center for Partnership Systems==
In 1987, in partnership with her late husband David Elliot Loye, Eisler founded The Center for Partnership Studies, which was later renamed The Center for Partnership Systems. The organization is &quot;dedicated to research, education, and building tools to construct economic and social systems that support human beings and the planet that sustains us.&quot;

As of 2024, the Center acts as a digital hub of resources, tools, connections, and community designed to empower and educate people involved in the #PartnershipMovement worldwide.

==Influence==
Nobel Peace Laureate, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, called Eisler&#x27;s book &quot;The Real Wealth of Nations&quot; “a template for the better world we have been so urgently seeking”, adding “this brilliant book shows how we can build economic systems that meet both our material and spiritual needs.” 

Jennifer Siebel Newsom, who uses the title “first partner of California&quot;, wrote of Eisler&#x27;s book &quot;Nurturing Our Humanity&quot; “In a world that feels ever more dangerous, divided, and out of balance, &quot;Nurturing Our Humanity&quot; outlines the roadmap for a world that leads with partnership – where empathy, care, and community are valued above all, and each can fulfill our full human potential.” 

Ashley Montagu called Eisler&#x27;s book &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; “The most important book since Darwin’s Origin of Species.&quot;

Gloria Steinem called her book &quot;Sacred Pleasure&quot; “Eisler’s most stunning, far-reaching, and practical gift – both to readers and to a world that must change or perish.” 

The children&#x27;s troubadour Raffi, called Eisler&#x27;s book on education, &quot;Tomorrow’s Children&quot; “a pathway toward a child-honoring society.”

Marianne Williamson called Eisler&#x27;s book &quot;The Power of Partnership&quot; “Stunning…the map to a world that works for all of us.” 

Philosopher Terence McKenna referenced Eisler&#x27;s work throughout his writings and talks, including in &quot;The Archaic Revival.&quot; In 1988, Eisler and McKenna gave a talk entitled Man And Woman At The End Of History together in Ojai CA, Mill Valley.

Eisler&#x27;s term dominator culture has been used by writers ranging from bell hooks to Tao Lin.

Her work is taught in high schools, universities, and corporate learning environments, and has influenced people worldwide.

Comments on Eisler&#x27;s keynotes:

“I wanted to make sure you appreciate the remarkable impact you had on the entire leadership team at Case Western Reserve University when you gave that inspirational keynote address to our deans, vice presidents, and senior faculty. Your talk sent more reverberations through our community than any speaker we&#x27;d ever had.” Edward M. Hundert, M.D., President, Case Western Reserve University, 2002–2006

&quot;Riane Eisler spoke to the hearts and the heads of the top women at Microsoft. She was compelling not only in her compassion and humanity, but even more so with her strong logic and sense of urgency. She is a wonderful, inspiring speaker!&quot; Alex Loeb, Former Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Corporation

<text>Bernd Mayländer (born 29 May 1971 in Waiblingen) is a German racing driver and current Formula One safety car driver.

== Racing career ==
Bernd started his career in karting sport at the end of the 1980s. In the following years he made his way to the Formula Ford, the Porsche Carrera Cup and the original DTM. In 2000, he won the 24 Hours Nürburgring in a Porsche 911 GT3-R. When the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series was resumed in 2000, he drove for Mercedes-Benz. He raced for Mercedes in DTM from 2001 to 2004, having won one race at Hockenheimring in 2001.

== Safety car driver in Formula One ==
Mayländer is the safety car driver for all Formula One races. He has driven the Formula One safety car since 2000 with very few exceptions, such as the 2001 Monaco Grand Prix and 2001 Canadian Grand Prix, when he was injured and was replaced by Marcel Fässler and the 2002 United States Grand Prix when he was replaced by Irish racing driver Damien Faulkner.

As of 2018, Mayländer had led over 700 laps in Formula One during his career. Peter Tibbetts serves as his map reader.

During a test prior to the 2024 Italian Grand Prix, Mayländer lost control and crashed the safety car into a barrier at the Parabolica. He and passenger Richard Darker were not injured in the incident.

== Other ==
In May 2005, he was one of six Mercedes-Benz drivers taking part in a record drive. Three stock E320 CDI cars drove in 30 days around the clock, which resulted in an average speed of .

<doc id="1083148" wikidata="Q6778717" url="?curid=1083148" title="Mary-Dell Chilton">
<text>Mary-Dell Chilton (born February 2, 1939, in Indianapolis, Indiana) is one of the founders of modern plant biotechnology.

==Early life and education==
Chilton attended private school for her early education. She earned both a B.S. and Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She later completed postdoctoral work at the University of Washington at Seattle

==Career and research==
Chilton taught and performed research at Washington University in St. Louis. While on faculty there in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she led a collaborative research study that produced the first transgenic plants.

Chilton was the first (1977) to demonstrate the presence of a fragment of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; Ti plasmid DNA in the nuclear DNA of crown gall tissue. Her research on &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; also showed that the genes responsible for causing disease could be removed from the bacterium without adversely affecting its ability to insert its own DNA into plant cells and modify the plant&#x27;s genome. Chilton described what she had done as &quot;disarming&quot; the bacterial plasmid responsible for the DNA transfer. She and her collaborators produced the first genetically modified plants using &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; carrying the disarmed Ti plasmid (1983). She has been called the &quot;queen of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;.&quot;

Chilton is author of more than 100 scientific publications. She is a Distinguished Science Fellow at Syngenta Biotechnology, Inc. She began her corporate career in 1983 with CIBA-Geigy Corporation (a legacy company of Syngenta).

==Awards and honors==
For her work with &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot;, she has been recognized with an honorary doctorate from the University of Louvaine, the John Scott Medal from the City of Philadelphia, membership in the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Sciences from the Franklin Institute.

She was honored by the Crop Science Society of America in 2011 with the organization&#x27;s Presidential Award.

In honor of her many achievements, in 2002 Syngenta announced creation of the Mary-Dell Chilton Center – a new administrative and conference center which was added to the company&#x27;s facility in Research Triangle Park, in North Carolina.

In June 2013, she was named a laureate of the prestigious 2013 World Food Prize.

In 2015, Chilton was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2020, she was one of eight women featured in &quot;The Only One in the Room&quot; display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

Chilton has been recognized as a Pioneer Member of the American Society of Plant Biologists.

The National Medal of Technology and Innovation was awarded to Chilton by President Biden in 2023.

<doc id="1083155" wikidata="Q178496" url="?curid=1083155" title="Composting toilet">
<text>A composting toilet is a type of dry toilet that treats human waste by a biological process called composting. This process leads to the decomposition of organic matter and turns human waste into compost-like material. Composting is carried out by microorganisms (mainly bacteria and fungi) under controlled aerobic conditions. Most composting toilets use no water for flushing and are therefore called &quot;dry toilets&quot;.

In many composting toilet designs, a carbon additive such as sawdust, coconut coir, or peat moss is added after each use. This practice creates air pockets in the human waste to promote aerobic decomposition. This also improves the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and reduces potential odor. Most composting toilet systems rely on mesophilic composting. Longer retention time in the composting chamber also facilitates pathogen die-off. The end product can also be moved to a secondary system – usually another composting step – to allow more time for mesophilic composting to further reduce pathogens.

Composting toilets, together with the secondary composting step, produce a humus-like end product that can be used to enrich soil if local regulations allow this. Some composting toilets have urine diversion systems in the toilet bowl to collect the urine separately and control excess moisture. A vermifilter toilet is a composting toilet with flushing water where earthworms are used to promote decomposition to compost.

Composting toilets do not require a connection to septic tanks or sewer systems unlike flush toilets. Common applications include national parks, remote holiday cottages, ecotourism resorts, off-grid homes and rural areas in developing countries.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;composting toilet&quot; is used quite loosely, and its meaning varies by country. For example, in Germany and Scandinavian countries, composting always refers to a predominantly aerobic process. This aerobic composting may take place with an increase in temperature due to microbial action, or without a temperature increase in the case of slow composting or cold composting. If earth worms are used (vermicomposting) then there is also no increase in temperature.

Composting toilets differ from pit latrines and arborloos, which use less controlled decomposition and may not protect groundwater from nutrient or pathogen contamination or provide optimal nutrient recycling. They also differ from urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) where pathogen reduction is achieved through dehydration (also known by the more precise term &quot;desiccation&quot;) and where the feces collection vault is kept as dry as possible. Composting toilets aim to have a certain degree of moisture in the composting chamber.

Composting toilets can be used to implement an ecological sanitation approach for resource recovery, and some people call their composting toilet designs &quot;ecosan toilets&quot; for that reason. However, this is not recommended as the two terms (i.e. composting and ecosan) are not identical.

Composting toilets have also been called &quot;sawdust toilets&quot;, which can be appropriate if the amount of aerobic composting taking place in the toilet&#x27;s container is very limited. The &quot;Clivus multrum&quot; is a type of composting toilet which has a large composting chamber below the toilet seat and also receives undigested organic material to increase the carbon to nitrogen ratio. Alternatives with smaller composting chambers are called &quot;self-contained composting toilets&quot; since the composting chamber is part of the toilet unit itself.

== Applications ==

Composting toilets can be suitable in areas such as a rural area or a park that lacks a suitable water supply, sewers and sewage treatment. They can also help increase the resilience of existing sanitation systems in the face of possible natural disasters such as climate change, earthquakes or tsunami. Composting toilets can reduce or perhaps eliminate the need for a septic tank system to reduce environmental footprint (particularly when used in conjunction with an on-site greywater treatment system).

These types of toilets can be used for resource recovery by reusing sanitized feces and urine as fertilizer and soil conditioner for gardening or ornamental activities.

== Basics ==
===Components and use===
A composting toilet consists of two elements: a place to sit or squat and a collection/composting unit. The composting unit consists of four main parts:
* storage or composting chamber
* a ventilation unit to ensure that the degradation process in the toilet is predominantly aerobic and to vent odorous gases
* a leachate collection or urine diversion system to remove excess liquid
* an access door for extracting the compost
Many composting toilets collect urine in the same chamber as feces, thus they do not divert urine. Adding small amounts of water that is used for anal cleansing is no problem for the composting toilet to handle.

Some composting toilets divert urine (and water used for anal washing) to prevent the creation of anaerobic conditions that can result from over saturation of the compost, which leads to odors and vector problems. This usually requires all users to use the toilet in a seated position. Offering a waterless urinal in addition to the toilet can help keep excess amounts of urine out of the composting chamber. Alternatively, in rural areas, men and boys may be encouraged just to find a tree.

=== Construction ===
The composting chamber can be constructed above or below ground level. It can be inside a structure or include a separate superstructure.

A drainage system removes leachate. Otherwise, excess moisture can cause anaerobic conditions and impede decomposition. Urine diversion can improve compost quality, since urine contains large amounts of ammonia that inhibits microbiological activity.

Composting toilets greatly reduce human waste volumes through psychrophilic, thermophilic or mesophilic composting. Keeping the composting chamber insulated and warm protects the composting process from slowing due to low temperatures.

=== Odorous gases ===
The following gases may be emitted during the composting process that takes place in composting toilets: hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia, nitrous oxide (N2O) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These gases can potentially lead to complaints about odours. Some methane may also be present, but it is not odorous.

==Pathogen removal==
Waste-derived compost recycles fecal nutrients, but it can carry and spread pathogens if the process of reuse of waste is not done properly. Pathogen destruction rates in composting toilets are usually low, particularly of helminth eggs (such as those from the genus &quot;Ascaris&quot;). This carries the risk of spreading disease if a proper system management is not in place. Compost from human waste processed under only mesophilic conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production. High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. Helminth infections are common in many developing countries.

In thermophilic composting bacteria that thrive at temperatures of oxidize (break down) waste into its components, some of which are consumed in the process, reducing volume and eliminating potential pathogens. To destroy pathogens, thermophilic composting must heat the compost pile sufficiently, or enough time (1–2 years) must elapse since fresh material was added that biological activity has had the same pathogen removal effect.

One guideline claims that pathogen levels are reduced to a safe level by thermophilic composting at temperatures of 55 °C for at least two weeks or at 60 °C for one week. An alternative guideline claims that complete pathogen destruction may be achieved already if the entire compost heap reaches a temperature of for one hour, for one day, for one week or for one month, although others regard this as overly optimistic.

== Design considerations ==
=== Environmental factors ===

Four main factors affect the decomposition process:
* Sufficient oxygen is necessary for aerobic composting
* Moisture content from 45 to 70 percent (heuristically, &quot;the compost should feel damp to the touch, with only a drop or two of water expelled when tightly squeezed in the hand&quot;.)
* Temperature between and , which is achieved through proper chamber dimensioning and possibly active mixing
* Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) of 25:1

=== Additives and bulking material ===
Human waste and food waste do not provide optimum conditions for composting. Usually the water and nitrogen content is too high, particularly when urine is mixed with feces. Additives or &quot;bulking material&quot;, such as wood chips, bark chips, sawdust, shredded dry leaves, ash and pieces of paper can absorb moisture. The additives improve pile aeration and increase the carbon to nitrogen ratio. Bulking material also covers feces and reduces insect access. Absent sufficient bulking material, the material may become too compact and form impermeable layers, which leads to anaerobic conditions and odour.

=== Leachate management ===

Leachate removal controls moisture levels, which is necessary to ensure rapid, aerobic composting. Some commercial units include a urine-separator or urine-diverting system and/or a drain at the bottom of the composter for this purpose.

=== Aeration and mixing ===
Microbial action also requires oxygen, typically from the air. Commercial systems provide ventilation that moves air from the bathroom, through the waste container, and out a vertical pipe, venting above the roof. This air movement (via convection or fan forced) passes carbon dioxide and odors.

Some units require manual methods for periodic aeration of the solid mass such as rotating the composting chamber or pulling an &quot;aerator rake&quot; through the mass.

=== Comparisons with other types of toilets ===

==== Pit latrines ====
Composting toilets convert feces into a dry, odorless material which is very different to the wet fecal sludge produced in pit latrines which has to be taken care of through a fecal sludge management system. Composting toilets do not cause groundwater pollution due to their safe containment of feces in above-ground vaults compared to pit latrines, allowing composting toilets to be sited in locations where pit-based systems are not appropriate.

Composting toilets may have higher capital costs than pit latrines, but lower lifecycle costs. They require more involvement by the user than the &quot;drop and forget&quot; approach of pit latrines.

==== Flush toilets ====
Unlike flush toilets, composting toilets do not require a sewerage system and do not mix flushing water with urine and feces. They require more involvement by the user than the &quot;flush and forget&quot; approach of flush toilets connected to sewage treatment plants.

==== Urine-diverting dry toilets ====
Composting toilets, although similar to and sharing many advantages and disadvantages with urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDT), are more complex and require more maintenance to keep a consistent and relatively high moisture content. Some composting toilets are designed with urine diversion.

==Types==

Commercial units and construct-it-yourself systems are available. Variations include number of composting vaults, removable vault, urine diversion and active mixing/aeration.

=== Slow composting (or moldering) toilets ===
Most composting toilets use slow composting which is also called &quot;cold composting&quot;. The compost heap is built up step by step over time.

The finished end product from &quot;slow&quot; composting toilets (&quot;moldering toilets&quot; or &quot;moldering privies&quot; in the US), is generally not free of pathogens. World Health Organization Guidelines from 2006 offer a framework for safe reuse of waste, using a multiple barrier approach.

Slow composting toilets employ a passive approach. Common applications involve modest and often seasonal use, such as remote trail networks. They are typically designed such that the materials deposited can be isolated from the operational part. The toilet can also be closed to allow further mesophilic composting. Slow composting toilets rely on long retention times for pathogen reduction and for decomposition of waste or on the combination of time and/or the addition of red wiggler worms for vermi-composting. Worms can be introduced to accelerate composting. Some jurisdictions of the US consider these worms as invasive species.

=== Active composters (self-contained) ===
&quot;Self-contained&quot; composting toilets compost in a container within the toilet unit. They are slightly larger than a flush toilet, but use roughly the same floor space. Some units use fans for aeration, and optionally, heating elements to maintain optimum temperatures to hasten the composting process and to evaporate urine and other moisture. Operators of composting toilets commonly add a small amount of absorbent carbon material (such as untreated sawdust, coconut coir, or peat moss) after each use to create air pockets to encourage aerobic processing, to absorb liquid and to create an odor barrier. This additive is sometimes referred to as &quot;bulking agent&quot;. Some owner-operators use microbial &quot;starter&quot; cultures to ensure composting bacteria are in the process, although this is not critical.

=== Vermifilter toilet ===
A vermifilter toilet is a composting toilet with flushing water where earthworms are used to promote decomposition to compost. It can be connected to a low-flush or a micro-flush toilet which uses about per use. Solids accumulate on the surface of the filter bed while liquid drains through the filter medium and is discharged from the reactor. The solids (feces and toilet paper) are aerobically digested by aerobic bacteria and composting earthworms into castings (humus), thereby significantly reducing the volume of organic material.

=== Other ===
Some units employ roll-away containers fitted with aerators, while others use sloped-bottom tanks.

== Maintenance ==
Maintenance is critical to ensure proper operation, including odor prevention. Maintenance tasks include: cleaning, servicing technical components such as fans and removal of compost, leachate and urine. Urine removal is only required for those types of composting toilets using urine diversion.

Once composting is complete (or earlier), the compost must be removed from the unit. How often this occurs is a function of container size, usage and composting conditions, such as temperature. Active, hot composting may require months, while passive, cold composting may require years. Properly managed units yield output volumes of about 10% of inputs.

== Uses of compost ==
The material from composting toilets is a humus-like material, which can be suitable as a soil amendment for agriculture. Compost from residential composting toilets can be used in domestic gardens, and this is the main such use.

Enriching soil with compost adds substantial nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon and calcium. In this regard compost is equivalent to many fertilizers and manures purchased in garden stores. Compost from composting toilets has a higher nutrient availability than the dried feces that result from a urine-diverting dry toilet.

Urine is typically present, although some is lost via leaching and evaporation. Urine can contain up to 90 percent of the residual nitrogen, up to 50 percent of the phosphorus, and up to 70 percent of the potassium.

Compost derived from these toilets has in principle the same uses as compost derived from other organic waste products, such as sewage sludge or municipal organic waste. However, users of waste-derived compost must consider the risk of pathogens.

===Pharmaceutical residues===
Waste-derived compost may contain prescription pharmaceuticals. Such residues are also present in conventional sewage treatment effluent. This could contaminate groundwater. Among the medications that have been found in groundwater in recent years are antibiotics, antidepressants, blood thinners, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, Ibuprofen, caffeine, carbamazepine, fibrates and cholesterol-reducing medications. Between 30% and 95% of pharmaceuticals medications are excreted by the human body. Medications that are lipophilic (dissolved in fats) are more likely to reach groundwater by leaching from fecal wastes. Sewage treatment plants remove an average of 60% of these medications. The percentage of medications degraded during composting of waste has not yet been reported.

== History ==
In the late 19th century in developed countries, some inventors, scientists and public health officials supported the use of &quot;dry earth closets&quot;, a type of dry toilet with similarities to composting toilets, although the collection vessel for the human waste was not designed to compost.

== Society and culture ==

=== Regulations ===

==== International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ====
In 2016, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the standard &quot;Activities relating to drinking water and wastewater services — Guidelines for the management of basic on-site domestic wastewater services&quot;. The standard is meant to be used in conjunction with ISO 24511. It deals with toilets (including composting toilets) and toilet waste. The guidelines are applicable to basic wastewater systems and include the complete domestic wastewater cycle, such as planning, usability, operation and maintenance, disposal, reuse and health.

====International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials====

The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) is a plumbing and mechanical code structure adopted by many developed countries. It recently proposed an addition to its &quot;Green Plumbing Mechanical Code Supplement&quot; that, &quot;...outlines performance criteria for site built composting toilets with and without urine diversion and manufactured composting toilets.&quot; If adopted, this composting and urine diversion toilet code (the first of its kind in the United States) will appear in the 2015 edition of the Green Supplement to the Uniform Plumbing Code.

==== United States ====
No performance standards for composting toilets are universally accepted in the US. Seven jurisdictions in North America use &quot;American National Standard/NSF International Standard ANSI/NSF 41-1998: Non-Liquid Saturated Treatment Systems&quot;. An updated version was published in 2011. Systems might also be listed with the Canadian Standards Association, cETL-US, and other standards programs.

Regarding byproduct regulation, several US states permit disposal of solids from composting toilets (usually a distinction between different types of dry toilets is not made) by burial, with varying or no minimum depth mandates (as little as 6 inches). For instance:
* Massachusetts: &quot;Residuals from the composting toilet system must be buried on-site and covered with a minimum of six inches of clean compacted soil. Massachusetts requires that any liquids produced but, &quot;not recycled through the toilet [itself, be] either discharged through a greywater system on the property that includes a septic tank and soil absorption system, or removed by a licensed septage hauler.&quot;
* Oregon: &quot;Humus from composting toilets may be used around ornamental shrubs, flowers, trees, or fruit trees and shall be buried under at least twelve inches of soil cover.&quot;
* Rhode Island: &quot;Solids produced by alternative toilets may be buried on site&quot; while &quot;residuals shall not be applied to food crops.&quot;
* Virginia: &quot;All materials removed from a composting privy shall be buried,&quot; and &quot;compost material shall not be placed in vegetable gardens or on the ground surface.&quot;
* Vermont: &quot;Byproducts may be disposed via &quot;...shallow burial in a location approved by the Agency that meets the minimum site conditions [required for an onsite septic tank-based sanitation system].&quot;
* Washington: models its extensive regulations for what it refers to as &quot;waterless toilets&quot; on the federal regulations that govern sewage sludge.
The Environmental Protection Agency has no jurisdiction over the byproducts of a dry toilet as long as waste are not referred to as &quot;fertilizer&quot; (but instead simply a material that is being disposed of). Federal rule 503, known colloquially as the &quot;EPA Biosolids rule&quot; or the &quot;EPA sludge rule&quot; applies only to fertilizer. Thus, individual states regulate composting toilets.

==== Germany====
The regulations for composting toilets and other forms of dry toilets in Germany vary from state to state and from one application to another (e.g. use in allotment gardens or use in family homes and settlements). In the different states of Germany, it is the &quot;Landesbauordnung&quot; (translates to &quot;state civil engineering regulations&quot;) of the respective state that regulates the use of such alternative toilets. Most of them stipulate the use of flush toilets, however there are many exceptions, for example in the states of Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These generally make exceptions for the use of composting toilets in homes provided that there are no concerns for public health.

Regulations governing the use of compost and urine from composting toilets is less clear in Germany but it seems generally allowed provided it is used on one&#x27;s own property and not sold to third parties.

== Examples ==

=== Finland ===

Numerous sparsely settled villages in rural areas in Finland are not connected to municipal water supply or sewer networks, requiring homeowners to operate their own systems. Individual private wells, i.e. shallow dug wells or boreholes in the bedrock, are often used for water supply, and many homeowners have opted for composting toilets. In addition, these toilets are common at holiday homes, often located near sensitive water bodies. For these reasons, many manufacturers of composting toilets are based in Finland, including Biolan, Ekolet, Kekkilä, Pikkuvihreä and Raita Environment.

Estimates made by leading Finnish composting toilet manufacturers and the Global Dry Toilet Association of Finland provided the following 2014 figures for composting toilet use in Finland:
* About 4% of single-family homes not connected to a public sewer network are equipped with a composting toilet.
* Some 200,000 manufactured composting toilets are thought to serve holiday homes, matched by the number of other dry toilets. The simplest ones are sited in an outhouse.

=== Germany ===

Composting toilets have been successfully installed in houses with up to four floors. An estimate from 2008 put the number of composting toilets in households in Germany at 500. Most of these residences are also connected to a sewer system; the composting toilet was not installed due to a lack of sewer system but for other reasons, mainly because of an &quot;ecological mindset&quot; of the owners.

In Germany and Austria, composting toilets and other types of dry toilets have been installed in single and multi-family houses (e.g. Hamburg, Freiburg, Berlin), ecological settlements (e.g. Hamburg-Allermöhe, Hamburg-Braamwisch, Kiel-Hassee, Bielefeld-Waldquelle, Wien-Gänserndorf) and in public buildings (e.g. Ökohaus Rostock, VHS-Ökostation Stuttgart-Wartberg, public toilets in recreational areas, restaurants and huts in the Alps, house boats and forest Kindergartens).

The ecological settlement in Hamburg-Allermöhe has had composting toilets since 1982. The settlement of 36 single-family houses with approximately 140 inhabitants uses composting toilets, rainwater harvesting and constructed wetlands. Composting toilets save about 40 litres of water per capita per day compared to a conventional flush toilet (10 liter per flush), which adds up to 2,044 m3 water savings per year for the whole settlement.

=== United States ===
Slow composting toilets have been installed by the Green Mountain Club in Vermont&#x27;s woodlands. They employ multiple vaults (called cribs) and a movable building. When one of the vaults fills, the building is moved over an empty vault. The full vault is left untouched for as long as possible (up to three years) before it is emptied. The large surface area and exposure to air currents can cause the pile to dry out. To counteract this, signs instruct users to urinate in the toilet. The club also uses pit latrines and simple bucket toilets with woodchips and external composting and directs users to urinate in the forest to prevent odiferous anaerobic conditions.

=== Worldwide ===
Composting toilets with a large composting container (of the type Clivus Multrum and derivations of it) are popular in US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Finland. They can be bought and installed as commercial products, as designs for self builders or as &quot;design derivatives&quot; which are marketed under various names. It has been estimated that approximately 10,000 such toilets might be in use worldwide.

<doc id="1083161" wikidata="Q9439618" url="?curid=1083161" title="Fidchell">
<text>&#x27; () or &#x27; (in Welsh, pronounced ) was a board game popular among the ancient Celts. Fidchell was played between two people who moved an equal number of pieces across a board; the board shared its name with the game played upon it. Based on the descriptions in Irish and Welsh literature as well as archaeological finds of game pieces, it is likely to have been a variant of ludus latrunculorum played in Ireland and Britain.

== Etymology ==
The name of the game in multiple Celtic languages -- Old Irish , Middle Welsh , Breton , Cornish -- is a compound translating to &quot;wood-wisdom&quot;, &quot;wood-intelligence&quot;, or &quot;wood-sense&quot;. The fact that the compound is identical in both languages suggests that it is of extreme antiquity, with the unattested earlier form being reconstructed &quot;*widu-kweillā&quot; &quot;wood-understanding&quot; in Common Celtic. The game is often compared to or identified with chess, though chess was unknown in Europe until the 12th century. The Old Irish form evolved into , the word used in modern Irish for modern chess, along with Scottish Gaelic &quot;fidhcheall&quot; and Manx &quot;feeal&quot;; the similar is the name in Welsh for modern chess.

==History==
 or is mentioned often in ancient Celtic legends and lore, but the exact form of the game is open to speculation due to lack of detail on the rules, playing pieces, and the board. It is clear that it was played on a board with opposing sets of pieces in equal numbers. It should not be confused with similar games of Norse origin like or (also called ), which involved a king in the centre and pieces in a 2:1 ratio. Evidence suggests that it may instead have been derived earlier from the Roman game &quot;ludus latrunculorum&quot; (&quot;game of highwaymen&quot;), which is known to have spread into Germanic and Celtic lands by the early first millennium and is also known from post-Roman Britain. Thus it is possible that was a descendant of . &quot;Fidchell&quot; shared with &quot;latrunculi&quot; the method of custodial capture, two around one enemy man on the same line. Archaeological finds such as the Stanway game discovered near Colchester with 13 pieces per side may also represent a British Celtic board game similar or identical to fidchell/gwyddbwyll.

== Gameplay ==

Some details of the gameplay can be deduced from literary mentions in early Irish literature. One text reads: &quot;Leth a fóirni d&#x27;ór buidi, in leth aili d&#x27;findruine&quot;

suggesting that was played by equal forces. The method of custodial capture with two men around one enemy on the same line is also explained in the Middle Irish tale of &quot;Mac da Cherda and Cummaine Foda&quot;, where a cleric plays &quot;fidchell&quot; all day, refusing to take his opponent&#x27;s pieces or allow his own to be taken:&quot;&quot;Maith&quot;, or Guaire, &quot;imrem fithchill.&quot; &quot;Cinda gontar ind fir?&quot;, or Cummaine. &quot;Ni anse, dias dub dam-sa im óinfer find duid-seo forsin n-óintí oc imchosnam na saigti thall.&quot; &quot;Mo cubais, immorro,&quot; or Cummaine, ni cumgaim-se anaill; acht ni gonab-sa ni gonfa-so mo moindter-sa.&quot; Laa chaidcht do Guaire oca thetarracht ⁊ ni ruba fer dia muinter. &quot;Segonda sein, a clerich,&quot; or Guaire.&quot;

Unlike &quot;latrunculi&quot; with its usual pebble-shaped counters, however, conical pieces may also have been innovated among the Insular Celts, as stone cones for gaming have been found in sites at Shetland, Scotland and Knowth, Ireland. This is also suggested by Irish legends such as the &quot;Echtra Nerai&quot; where fidchell pieces become lodged in a skull during a fight:&quot;Doneco Fergus seco la soduin ocus bentoi sethnu a chinn do Briccriu cona durn co lotur na cuicfir fichilli batar hind-dum Ferguso hi cenn m-Briccriunn, co m-bo buan d&#x27;olcc do.&quot;

The legends describe as a game played by royalty and by gods. In legend, it was invented by , god of light and inspiration, and was played skilfully by his son, the hero . A series of games form an important episode in the story . 

Lavish, sometimes mystical boards appear often in medieval Welsh literature. In &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, a prose tale associated with the , King Arthur and play the game with golden men on a silver board. In another prose tale, &quot;The Dream of&quot;, the character is carving men for his golden board when he is visited by the emperor . The board of is named as one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain in lists dating from the 15th and 16th centuries; according to the lists the board is gold and the men silver, and the pieces play against each other automatically. A magic comparable to &#x27;s appears in the Arthurian romance &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;; a number of French versions of the Holy Grail story feature similar chessboards with self-moving pieces, following the Second Continuation of &#x27;s &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, though in these only one side moves, while the hero plays the other.

According to H. J. R. Murray&#x27;s &quot;A History of Chess&quot;, the ultimate fate of Fidchell is shown a margin note upon one 15th-century manuscript about the &quot;Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh&quot; between the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomorians in Irish mythology. In the gloss, it is disputed whether Fidchell (&quot;chess&quot;) could have been invented during the Trojan War, as both wars were traditionally believed to have taken place at roughly the same time and the Irish mythology manuscript refers to the playing of fidchell. While it is no longer possible to know whether it was introduced into Gaelic Ireland by the Hiberno-Norse or the Normans, by the 15th-century &quot;Fidchell&quot; had come to mean Chess in the Irish language and the original rules of the game had been completely forgotten.

==Confusion with &quot;tafl&quot;==
In the board games literature, it has often been suggested that is a variant of the Welsh game , itself descended from the Norse games. These games, along with the Irish , are played on a grid, often seven squares by seven, with the king in the middle. The king has a number of defending pieces around it at the beginning of the game, and they are surrounded by twice as many attackers. The object is to make a clear path for the king to the edge of the board, while the attackers must attempt to surround, and thereby capture, the king. However, variants are usually played with unequal numbers of pieces, the attackers being twice as numerous as the defenders. by contrast was played with equal numbers on both sides and there is no indication of a king piece.

An artefact found in Ballinderry, County Westmeath in 1932, known as the Ballinderry Game Board, has been suggested to represent fidchell. This is a wooden board with Celtic symbols on it, with a seven-by-seven grid, marked off by 49 holes.
This artefact may be a variant, and perhaps even a board; many commentators assume that it is the type of board upon which one would have played . Based on the assumption that the Ballinderry board represented fidchell, some recent tafl board reconstructions and apps have given the name of &quot;fitchneal&quot; to a particular 7x7 tafl arrangement (see image), which has extended the confusion.

Historically, games, especially , were often played with a die, made of a sheep&#x27;s knucklebone, and this feature seems absent in . In Wales, a clear distinction is made between and , which, if also true of Ireland, would tend to indicate a similar distinction between and .

==Historical impact==
, as described in the legends, often has a mystical or divinatory aspect to it. Battles ebb and flow as a result of the ebb and flow of a game of , games play themselves, great events are decided on the outcome of a match. This supernatural aspect is not as clearly reflected in the games. 

There is clear archaeological and textual evidence that a variant was played in Ireland in ancient times; however, this is more likely to have been the game of &quot;brandub&quot;, which had a king piece. Fidchell was played with equal forces, and so was not a form of tafl.

<text>Warp Films is an independent film and television production company based in Sheffield and London, England, UK.

==History 2001 – 2012==
Warp Films was established by Warp Records founding partners Rob Mitchell and Steve Beckett. It was initially created with financial support from NESTA and had a remit to produce a number of short films.

After the death of Rob Mitchell in 2001, Beckett decided to continue with Warp Films and enlisted the expertise of Sheffield friend Mark Herbert (who had just produced the critically acclaimed first series of Peter Kay&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; for Channel 4) to run the company.

The first film, Chris Morris&#x27; &quot;My Wrongs#8245-8249 &amp; 117&quot;, was shot in 2002. It won the award for Best Short Film at the 2003 BAFTA Film Awards and became the first short film DVD single in the UK market.

Through the star of &quot;My Wrongs&quot;, Paddy Considine, Herbert met director Shane Meadows and asked them to generate an idea for a film. Herbert raised the funding and the result was Warp Films debut feature, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Shoes&quot;, directed by Shane Meadows in 2004.

Shot in 22 days on a tight budget, and produced from Warp Films&#x27; Sheffield office (at that time a shed in Herbert&#x27;s garden), it earned a BAFTA nomination, was nominated for a record eight British Independent Film Awards, won the Hitchcock D&#x27;or at the Dinard Festival, and won the Southbank award for Best Film. It received strong critical acclaim and has been hailed as a landmark in British cinema.
It was ranked No. 27 in Empire magazines list of the best British films ever

In 2005, Warp Films produced Rubber Johnny, an experimental short and 42-page book by director Chris Cunningham, featuring music by Warp Records artist Aphex Twin.

Warp Films break-out success came with Shane Meadows&#x27; &quot;This Is England&quot;, the story of Shaun, a boy who is adopted by a local skinhead gang after his father is killed in the Falklands war. Since its release in early 2007 it has gained many awards including the Best Film at the British Independent Films Awards, the Special Jury Prize at the Rome Film Festival and Best British Film at the BAFTAs.

At the same ceremony, Warp Films received its third BAFTA as Paddy Considine&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dog Altogether&quot; won the Best Short Film award.

Three months after &quot;This Is England&quot; was released in cinemas, Warp&#x27;s third feature film, &quot;Grow Your Own&quot;, was released by Pathe. The film was Warp&#x27;s first collaboration with BBC Films. The film was directed by Richard Laxton and written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Carl Hunter, developed from stories Carl had uncovered in his documentary work about the travails of immigrants. Produced by Barry Ryan for Warp Films, Luke Alkin for BBC Films and Carl Hunter for Art in Action.

In 2004, Warp Films made a significant expansion in its capacity. Robin Gutch joined Mark Herbert and Barry Ryan to devise the Warp bid for the Low Budget Film Scheme tender put out by Film4 and UK Film Council. The Warp bid was backed by Optimum Releasing, Screen Yorkshire and EM Media. Warp won the tender against stiff competition and Warp X was formally set up as Warp X in 2005 as a low-budget digital &#x27;studio&#x27; to develop and produce films with focus on new talent and commercial potential.

The first projects under the new label were Chris Waitt&#x27;s &quot;A Complete History of My Sexual Failures&quot; and Olly Blackburn&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Punch&quot;, which were both launched at the Sundance International Film Festival in 2007. These were followed by Mark Tonderai&#x27;s Hush Paul King&#x27;s Bunny &amp; the Bull
(Toronto International Film Festival 2009, BIFA for Best Production Achievement 2010,
) Xiaolu Guo&#x27;s She, a Chinese
( in collaboration with Tiger Lily Films) which won the Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival

Another Warp X production was 2009 documentary &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, covering the history of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival. The film was created using footage generated by the fans and musicians attending the events themselves, on a multitude of formats including Super8, camcorder and mobile phone.

In 2009, Warp films produced &quot;Exhibit A&quot;, a groundbreaking pseudo-documentary film. The film was awarded the title of &#x27;Best UK feature&#x27; at the Raindance Film Festival and was nominated for three British Independent Film Awards receiving particular credit for its standout cast.

In 2010, Warp Films produced Chris Morris’s debut feature &quot;Four Lions&quot;, a satirical comedy drama following a group of homegrown Islamic terrorists from Sheffield, England. The film was a critical and box office success, achieving impressive numbers at the box office on its opening weekend, generating the highest site average of all the new releases (£5,292) and making a total of £609,000. As of 8 August 2010, Four Lions grossed £2,932,366 at the UK box office. The film was nominated for two BAFTA awards; it won the &#x27;Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, director, or Producer&#x27; BAFTA award for Chris Morris.

Richard Ayoade&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Submarine&quot; starring Noah Taylor, Sally Hawkins and Paddy Considine premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2010
and was released in the UK during March 2011 by Optimum Releasing. It was distributed in the US by The Weinstein Company.

The film was met with high critical acclaim, and featured original songs by Arctic Monkeys front man Alex Turner. &quot;Submarine&quot; has won many awards worldwide, including the Best Screenplay award at the 2011 British Independent Film Awards. Richard Ayoade was nominated for a BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer at the 65th British Academy Film Awards

Warp Films 2010 television production for Channel 4, Shane Meadows&#x27; &quot;This Is England &#x27;86&quot;, was a continuation from the 2006 film. It aired over four weekly episodes and received numerous plaudits, including a BAFTA award for leading actress Vicky McClure.
It achieved record viewing figures for Channel 4.

Warp X production Kill List was released in the UK on 28 August 2011. Directed by Ben Wheatley, the film stars Neil Maskell, Michael Smiley and MyAnna Buring. It has gone on to win several awards internationally, including a British Independent Film Award for supporting actor Michael Smiley.
Kill List has received strong critical acclaim, with Total Film declaring it &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; and giving a 5 star rating. It was released in the US by IFC films.

&quot;Tyrannosaur&quot;, also produced through Warp X, was released in 2011. Directed by Paddy Considine, it was an exploration of how love and friendship can be found in the darkest of places. &quot;Tyrannosaur&quot; stars Peter Mullan, Olivia Colman and Eddie Marsan. It has received strong critical acclaim and won the BAFTA for &#x27;Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, director, or Producer&#x27; for director Paddy Considine and producer Diarmid Scrimshaw.

2011 also saw the world premiere of Justin Kurzel&#x27;s &quot;Snowtown&quot; in Semaine du Critiique at the Cannes International Film Festival. In 2008, Warp Films had established Warp Films Australia in Melbourne, headed up by Anna McLeish.
The film has received widespread acclaim and won numerous awards internationally, including four awards at the Australian Academy Cinema Television Awards. In late 2015, the partnership ended with the setting up of Carver Films by Anna McLeish and Sarah Shaw.

&quot;This Is England &#x27;88&quot;, the sequel to the 2010 television series &quot;This Is England &#x27;86&quot;, aired on Channel 4 over three consecutive nights from 13 December 2011.
Set two and half years after &#x27;86, it received strong critical praise. The series had high viewing figures, with 2.5 million people tuning-in to watch the first episode.

Warp Films / Warp X productions, Tyrannosaur, Kill List and Submarine were nominated for a total of 18 awards at the 2011 British Independent Film Awards.

Warp Films successfully ran a crowd-funding campaign to fund four short films shot at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival by Vincent Moon, using the website Kickstarter.com. The project reached its funding goal on 15 October and the films are currently in post-production.

Warp Films produced three 30-minute television dramas for the Sky Arts Playhouse Presents season. These were &quot;The Minor Character&quot;, written by Will Self and starring David Tennant (which was Sky Arts highest rating commission on the channel
), &quot;The Snipist&quot; directed by Matthew Holness and &quot;The District Nurse&quot; starring Gina McKee.

<doc id="1083175" wikidata="Q7656151" url="?curid=1083175" title="Swildon's Hole">
<text>Swildon&#x27;s Hole is an extensive cave in Priddy, Somerset. At in length, it is the longest cave on the Mendip Hills. It has been found to be connected to Priddy Green Sink and forms part of the Priddy Caves Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

The upper series of the cave compresses many features into a relatively short space. The cave goes far beyond this, however, and the lower reaches of the cave continue to provide challenges for even the most experienced of cave divers.

The name may be a corruption of Swithun, an Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchester, as the land in the area was owned by St Swithin&#x27;s Priory in Winchester.

== History ==
The cave was first entered on 16 August 1901 by members of the Wells Natural History and Archaeological Society. Very rapid progression was made to what is now known as the 40 foot pot. Between 1903 and 1910, in spite of access being banned by the landowner, various trips took place to photograph and explore the passages.

In 1914 the limit of exploration was extended to Twenty Foot Pot, and in 1921 the first of the sumps was reached, but not passed (despite attempts to make progress by blasting). Sump 1 was finally successfully dived in 1936, and Sump 2 was passed soon afterwards. By this point a length of cave only one-fifth of the amount known today had been discovered.

Ever since 1936 caving groups have been seeking to extend the explored area of the cave, and thus far eleven principal sumps have been passed. Sump 12 has so far proved impassable. Work continues to find a way through the adjacent Sump 12b.

== Access ==
The entrance to Swildon&#x27;s Hole is now a small triangular opening contained within a stone blockhouse in a clump of trees north-east of Manor Farm, Priddy.

Swildon&#x27;s Hole is a very popular cave and there are often several separate groups underground at the same time.

== Description ==
The cave contains an active streamway, which has caused a highly varied cave system. Areas of the system range from low passages, through which cavers must crawl, to impressive chambers with sheer drops, and from dry fossil passages to thundering waterfalls and its infamous sumps. A plaque mounted on a stone plinth near Priddy village green shows a plan of the cave, overlaying a map of the village (see right).

The cave exhibits a combination of vadose development (formed above the water table), including continuing formation of the main streamway, and phreatic passages (formed below a latterly lowered water table). These resulted in very different types of passageway, with the phreatic tubes, since abandoned by much of the water, forming an undulating route, much of which is known as the ‘short round trip’.

Only a handful of the 11 principal sumps thus far passed can be dived without dedicated equipment (free-dived).
The length of cave between the sumps are known by the number of the sump at the end of the stretch; thus the stretch between the entrance and Sump 1 is known as Swildon&#x27;s One, between Sumps 1 and 2 as Swildon&#x27;s Two, and so on.

Sump 4 can be reached without going through Sumps 1 to 3, via Tratman&#x27;s Temple, Mud Sump, Fault Chamber and Blue Pencil Passage; parts of this route are extremely difficult.

The connection between Swildon&#x27;s Hole and Priddy Green Sink was the first major through route discovered on the Mendip Hills. Following a number of months of digging and blasting, the link was made in 1996 at the top of the Cowsh Avens Series, a climb above Sump 4.

The water in the cave resurges in Wookey Hole Caves. This was first demonstrated (by pouring dye into the water) by Graham Balcombe and Jack Sheppard of the Cave Diving Group, who first passed Sumps 1 and 2 in the 1930s.

<doc id="1083180" wikidata="Q333682" url="?curid=1083180" title="Gary Paffett">
<text>Gary James Paffett (born 24 March 1981 in Bromley) is a British former racing driver. Having become a household name in the DTM, following fifteen years in the series and two championship wins, Paffett moved onto Formula E for the 2018/19 championship, after it was announced in 2017 that Mercedes would no longer be taking part in DTM. Paffett was also a test driver for the Williams Formula One team, having previously worked in a similar role at McLaren for a number of years, during the team&#x27;s successful title winning years. Paffett progressed through the ranks of karting and junior formulae in the United Kingdom, winning the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award in 1999. He now lives in Ousden, Suffolk, England.

==Racing career==

===1993 to 1999: Early Years===
In 1993, Paffett joined the British Cadet Championships and earned himself a respectable third place. A year later he moved to British Junior TKM Championship and finished second overall. In 1995, he won the British Junior TKM Championship and also second place in the Junior ICA European Championship. Successes continued into 1996, winning the McLaren Mercedes Karting Champion of the Future award and also second in the British Junior ICA Championship. The next year he moved into single-seaters, winning the Formula Vauxhall Junior Winter Series, picking up the best newcomer&#x27;s award in that series in the process. In 1998, he was Formula Vauxhall Junior Class B Champion with thirteen poles and thirteen wins, dominating every race of the season. He also set a track record which had never before been set by any &quot;B&quot; class car. He got promoted to the Formula Vauxhall Junior and won the championship with two track records, four wins, five fastest laps, three pole positions. At the season&#x27;s end he was awarded the prestigious McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year award.

===Formula Three===
Moving up to Formula Three, he competed in the Scholarship class of the British F3 championship, becoming champion with twelve wins, thirteen fastest laps and thirteen pole positions. In 2001, moved overseas to the German F3 Championship racing with Keke Rosberg&#x27;s race team, finishing sixth overall. Remaining in the series for 2002, he dominated the field winning the championship without ever losing the lead.

===DTM===

For 2003, Gary signed to drive for the new Brand Motorsport team in F3000, but the team withdrew from the series leaving Paffett and his team-mate Nicolas Minassian without drives. Mercedes contacted him and signed him to drive in the DTM with Rosberg&#x27;s Mercedes AMG team in a year-old car, eventually finishing 11th overall. A year later, he was runner up with an up-to-date AMG-Mercedes C-Class and the HWA team taking four wins and one pole position. He was then champion the following year with five wins and four pole positions. In 2007, Gary returned to the DTM in a 2006 specification race car for the Persson Motorsport team alongside his McLaren F1 testing duties. At the second round at Oschersleben, Paffett became the first driver in the history of the series to win in a year old car. After a further year in older machinery, he was promoted back to the current Mercedes model for 2009, and finished runner-up in the championship, behind Timo Scheider.
==== 2018 season ====
In 2017, Mercedes announced it would leave DTM after the 2018 season. Since 2018 did also feature a rule change resulting in the cars having less downforce meaning that small contact would less likely result in race ending damage, Mercedes could come back from a dip in form over the last couple of years. In the first race at Hockenheim the Mercedes proved a serious contender and allowed Gary Paffett to take his first win since the Lausitz ring in 2013 in the first race at Hockenheim. The second Hockenheim race featured a momentous battle between Gary Paffett and Timo Glock which was won by the BMW driver. From here on, the Mercedes proved a very good car all through the season and with taking 3 wins and further 7 podiums, Paffett was at or very near the top of the table all season. In the mid-season, his main competitor was fellow Mercedes driver Paul Di Resta with the lead of the championship changing a couple of times between the two notably in Brands Hatch and Misano World Circuit. With Paffett having an unlucky raceweekend in the latter. In the last 3 race weekends, René Rast and his Audi team gave Paffett a very real challenge taking a win in all 6 races. This didn&#x27;t prove to be enough however with Paffett taking the crown in Hockenheim at the last race of the season and thus closing the book on DTM for Mercedes with the drivers title, team title and the manufacturers title, providing Paffett and the Mercedes-AMG team with the perfect fairytale ending to their DTM careers.

===Formula One===
In December 2005 it was announced that he would not be returning to the DTM series to defend his title but instead would test full-time for McLaren-Mercedes during the 2006 season alongside Pedro de la Rosa. After the departure of Kimi Räikkönen to Ferrari, it was speculated that he may have been in contention for a 2007 race seat in the team alongside World Champion Fernando Alonso. However, due to the arrival of GP2 Champion, Lewis Hamilton, Paffett was overlooked for the drive.

Further to this, Paffett was released from his McLaren contract in October 2006, to search for better opportunities. It was widely speculated that he was likely to sign as a test driver at Honda, but Christian Klien was signed instead. A few weeks later however, Paffett was re-signed by McLaren as the team&#x27;s second test driver, alongside de la Rosa.

He publicly stated that he was looking for a Formula One race seat for 2008, and was linked with the abortive Prodrive F1 project for that season. However, Prodrive failed to make it to the grid so Paffett stayed with McLaren as a test driver. Paffett was signed as Force India&#x27;s reserve driver for the 2012 Australian Grand Prix as regular reserve driver Jules Bianchi was unavailable due to Formula Renault 3.5 Series testing commitments. On 17 November 2014, it was announced that Paffett would leave McLaren at the end of the 2014 season. This coincided with McLaren&#x27;s switch to Honda engines for 2015.

For 2016, Paffett signed on with Williams as a simulator driver, alongside his duties in DTM. Team deputy Claire Williams said: &quot;We&#x27;re delighted to have someone with Gary&#x27;s experience join us at Williams. He is a highly professional racing driver and his level of testing knowledge, and ability to analyse data, will significantly help to drive forward development of the FW38 throughout the season.&quot;

===Formula E===

In the 2018–19 Formula E season, Paffett drove for the HWA Racelab Formula E team, together with the Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne. Marking a new adventure for Gary, following his fifteen legendary years in the German Touring Car Series, this season&#x27;s Formula E championship, marked both Gary&#x27;s and the HWA team&#x27;s debut campaign in the 12-round all electric series. He finished the season 19th in the driver&#x27;s standings after scoring points in Hong Kong, Paris and New York City. On 11 September 2019, it was announced that Paffett would be replaced by Nyck de Vries for the new Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team in the 2019–20 Formula E season. Paffett moved into a management role within the team, working as a sporting and technical advisor, while also being a test and reserve driver.

<doc id="1083183" wikidata="Q645494" url="?curid=1083183" title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl">
<text>and are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in 2006. They are the first installments in the fourth generation of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series. They were first released in Japan on September 28, 2006, and released in North America, Australia, and Europe in 2007. &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot;, a third version, was released two years later in each region. Remakes titled &quot;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&quot; and &quot;Shining Pearl&quot; were released for the Nintendo Switch worldwide on November 19, 2021. An interquel, &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;, was released for the Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022.

Like previous &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; chronicle the adventures of a young Pokémon Trainer as they train and battle Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization called Team Galactic. The games added many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with the addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games&#x27; Pokédex.

Development of &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; was announced at a Nintendo press conference in the fourth calendar quarter of 2004. The games were designed with features of the Nintendo DS in mind. It was forecasted to be released in Japan in 2005, but ultimately shipped in 2006, the 10th anniversary year of the franchise. In promotion of the games, Nintendo sold a limited-edition Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, and held a release party celebrating their North American release.

The games received generally favorable reviews. Most critics praised the addition of Wi-Fi features and graphics, and felt that the gameplay, though it had not received much updating from previous games, was still engaging. The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; have sold over 2 million more units than their predecessors &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; and almost 6 million more units than &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, while also outselling their successors, &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, by over 2 million copies. The games are among the most successful &quot;Pokémon&quot; games of all time.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; are role-playing video games with adventure elements. The basic mechanics of the games are largely the same as their predecessors. As with all &quot;Pokémon&quot; games for handheld consoles, the gameplay is in a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. Players begin the game with no Pokémon or Poké Balls but are given the choice of three Pokémon as a part of the storyline. Once Poké Balls are obtained, the player can capture more Pokémon. Players can use their Pokémon to deal damage to other Pokémon in battle. Whenever the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During the battle, the player may use a move, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee. Fleeing is not an option during battles against trainers. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); whenever a Pokémon&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless revived at a Pokémon Center or with an item. If the player&#x27;s Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon by causing it to faint, it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon whenever they reach a certain level. Pokémon&#x27;s stats also increase every time it levels up, and they will also learn new moves at certain levels as well. If a Pokémon is prevented from evolving it will learn new moves faster.

Apart from battling, capturing Pokémon returns as a critical component of &quot;Pokémon&quot; gameplay. Although other trainers&#x27; Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player&#x27;s active party or stores it if the player already has a maximum of six Pokémon in their party. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target&#x27;s HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis adds a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.

===New features===

As with other generations of &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; retain the basic gameplay of their predecessors while introducing additional new features. The day-night cycle makes a return and has increased from three times of day in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; to five time periods in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;: morning, day, afternoon, evening, and night. &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; also introduce several changes to battle mechanics. In previous generations, Pokémon moves were classified as &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;special&quot; based on their type; for example, all Fire-type moves were special and all Ground-type moves were physical. In &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, however, moves are categorized into three groups. Attacks that make physical contact with the opponent are &quot;physical&quot;, attacks that do not make physical contact are &quot;special&quot;, and moves that do not deal damage are classified as &quot;status&quot;.

Some of the games&#x27; new features capitalize on the Nintendo DS&#x27;s features. The Pokétch, a simulated smartwatch, resides on the DS&#x27;s bottom screen and hosts various applications including a clock, calculator, map, counter, and a drawing pad. These applications are obtained throughout the game. Beneath Sinnoh&#x27;s surface is the Underground, a large area used for wireless multiplayer gaming; in it, players can create and decorate secret bases, first featured in &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, and participate in minigames. The items mined in the Underground can then be transferred into the player&#x27;s bag in the main game. &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; also employ support for the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (since discontinued), allowing players to communicate through voice chat, trade, and battle online. The main system for trade is the Global Trade Station, which allows players to trade with people around the world. Players can search for any Pokémon that they have seen in the game and can offer their own; if another player is offering the requested Pokémon and is looking for the offered Pokémon, the trade occurs immediately. A trade does not have to be instant; an offer can be left for other players to browse and complete, even while the player is offline. Certain species of Pokémon traded internationally will have a Pokédex entry in the language of the game it originated from. According to &quot;Pokémon&quot; art director Ken Sugimori, the Global Trade Station was the new feature he was most pleased with.

Pokémon Contests are events in which the player&#x27;s Pokémon compete in a show to win ribbons and, in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, they consist of three stages, two more than the Contests of the Game Boy Advance games. In the Visual Competition stage, players use the Nintendo DS&#x27;s touchscreen to place accessories on their Pokémon to boost a particular trait, such as &quot;Cool&quot; or &quot;Cute&quot;, and earn points. In the Dance Competition stage, the player must tap buttons on the touchscreen in rhythm with the music. The final stage, Acting Competition, is similar to Pokémon Contests of the Game Boy Advance games; Pokémon use their moves to appeal to the judges and crowd. Like Pokéblocks in the third-generation games, baked goods called Poffins can be made from berries and fed to Pokémon to boost a particular trait, and therefore, the likelihood of success in a relevant Contest.

===Connectivity to other devices===
In addition to compatibility with each other, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; offer compatibility with the third generation &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Emerald&quot;, and &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. They are also compatible with &quot;Pokémon Ranger&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Battle Revolution&quot;. After earning the National Pokédex in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, the player can &quot;Migrate&quot; Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; by inserting a Game Boy Advance cartridge into the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot of the Nintendo DS while &quot;Diamond&quot; or &quot;Pearl&quot; is in the DS slot. After six Pokémon are uploaded from the cartridge, they are sent to the Pal Park, an area where the player can capture the transferred Pokémon. Pokémon uploads are restricted to six every twenty-four hours per Game Boy Advance cartridge, and the player must capture the uploaded Pokémon before performing another transfer. Pokémon transferred to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; this way cannot be sent back to a Game Boy Advance cartridge. After completing a special mission in &quot;Pokémon Ranger&quot;, the player will be able to send a Manaphy egg or Riolu from &quot;Ranger&quot; to &quot;Diamond&quot; or &quot;Pearl&quot;. Finally, players can wirelessly upload Pokémon from &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; to the Wii games &quot;Pokémon Battle Revolution&quot; and &quot;My Pokémon Ranch&quot;.

==Story==

===Setting===

&quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; are set in the fictional region of Sinnoh, an island based on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō. Sinnoh is not directly connected to any other Pokémon region. It is characterized by large, snow-covered mountains; Mt. Coronet, a part of a mountain range, divides Sinnoh in half. Unlike previous regions, Sinnoh has a &quot;northern&quot; feel to it because it is the first region with snow-covered routes. Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways with three main lakes, Verity, Acuity, and Valor, that form a triangle. Unlike the Hoenn region, however, which is mostly water routes, only 30 percent of Sinnoh&#x27;s landscape comprises waterways. Underneath Sinnoh&#x27;s surface is the Sinnoh Underground, which is a large maze of caves and tunnels.

===Plot===

The games chronicle the adventures of a new Pokémon Trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by collecting and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; feature eight Pokémon Gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges, the key to the advancement of the plot. As with all core games, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate, in this case, Team Galactic, who plan to use Pokémon to create a new universe just for themselves, while destroying the current one.

As with all other mainline &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; begin in the protagonist&#x27;s hometown. After viewing a television report about a media-conducted search for a red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake, the protagonist and their best friend, Barry by default, travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by a wild Starly each, the protagonist and their rival decide to examine the briefcase. They are then given a choice of one of three Pokémon found within—the Grass-type Turtwig, the Fire-type Chimchar, or the Water-type Piplup—and proceed to battle the attacking Pokémon. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to them, asking that they embark on a journey and fill their Pokédex.

The protagonist encounters the antagonistic group, Team Galactic, early in the game, when he or she must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The player encounters Team Galactic again when they take over a wind farm and when they set up a base in Eterna City, before eventually taking over Sinnoh&#x27;s three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit. Shortly after the player earns their seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia in &quot;Pearl&quot;, or Dialga in &quot;Diamond&quot;. After releasing the trio, the protagonist can access the Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic summons Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon&#x27;s powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia or Dialga, and after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. Afterward, the player continues their journey, eventually reaching the Sinnoh League. After defeating all Elite Four members, they battle the Sinnoh League Champion, a blonded woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. After the protagonist defeats Cynthia, they become the new Sinnoh League Champion, finishing the main story. In the post-game, a new island to explore contains Pokémon not seen in the main game and has some new stores and a tournament center. The protagonist&#x27;s old friend, who challenged them to battles multiple times before, will also be waiting for them here and will challenge them to one more battle.

==Development==
&quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were developed by Game Freak and Junichi Masuda served as game director. The game&#x27;s music was scored by Hitomi Sato and Junichi Masuda under the supervision of Go Ichinose, with a few other fanfares composed by Morikazu Aoki. According to The Pokémon Company&#x27;s Tsunekazu Ishihara, the games were designed with the DS&#x27;s unique features in mind, such as the Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridges. The command buttons in the battle screen are large and color-coded; according to Masuda, this feature would facilitate gameplay for players unable to read. Also, the touchscreen interface was designed to encourage players to use their fingers rather than the stylus to manipulate the screen. Though most of the graphics in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; are 2D, some of the background elements are 3D. The decision to retain 2D graphics in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; drew criticism; in response, Tsunekazu Ishihara said that &quot;we wanted to maintain the original idea of &quot;Pokémon&quot; being a game that you played on this big map&quot; and explained that physically, the games were in three dimensions but was designed to &quot;maintain the original feel of the game&quot;. Responding to criticism over the use of Friend Codes in the games, Ishihara explained that it was a security measure taken to ensure that players would not be able to chat with strangers over the Wi-Fi connection. Nintendo released a statement detailing glitches found in Japanese releases of &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;. The glitches caused players to be stuck in an in-game wall or lose saved data. Nintendo released patches to certain retailers in Japan to fix these glitches.

In mid 2020, dataminers leaked the source code for &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, revealing a collection of unused sprites and scrapped designs for new Pokémon. They were first leaked onto ResetEra, and were part of a series of Nintendo-related leaks of unfinished builds of games in development.

==Release==
Development of &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; was announced at a Nintendo press conference in the fourth calendar quarter of 2004 alongside the reveal of &quot;Pokémon Dash&quot; and details on the Japanese launch of the Nintendo DS. Masuda stated it would &quot;become a new type of game that offers a number of new forms of play&quot; and that he was determined to create &quot;the ultimate [&quot;Pokémon&quot;] version&quot;. Though &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were expected to be released in Japan by 2005, Nintendo revealed that the developers were still working on aspects of the gameplay and that the games would not be released until 2006. The company said that &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; would be able to communicate with &quot;Pokémon&quot; games for the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to transfer their Pokémon to the new games. Nintendo also announced that the games would make full use of the Wi-Fi capabilities of the DS, allowing 16 players to communicate wirelessly at one time. Further information concerning the games was not released until mid-2006, when Nintendo President Satoru Iwata mentioned that connectivity with &quot;Pokémon Battle Revolution&quot; was also still in development; new features such as the Pokétch and time sensitivity were also mentioned.
The games were released in Japan on September 28, 2006. To commemorate the release, Nintendo sold a limited-edition DS Lite in Japanese Pokémon Center stores and through the Pokémon fan club by mail. The console featured the games&#x27; mascots Dialga and Palkia painted in silver and gold respectively on a metallic black finish. A two-disc soundtrack, &quot;Nintendo DS &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; &amp; &quot;Pearl&quot; Super Music Collection&quot;, was also released in Japan on December 22, 2006. It peaked at #253 on Japan&#x27;s Oricon charts and charted for one week. On December 20, 2006, Nintendo of America announced that the North American release of the games was slated for April 22, 2007, and that those who pre-ordered their copies of the games would receive special DS styluses branded with some of the new Pokémon. Shortly before the games&#x27; North American release, The Pokémon Company presented a limited demo of the games for Nintendo&#x27;s booth at the Game Developer&#x27;s Conference. To celebrate the games&#x27; North American release, Nintendo held a release party at the Nintendo World Store in New York City&#x27;s Rockefeller Plaza. Nintendo of Europe announced a release date of July 27, 2007, for the European Union, and Nintendo Australia announced a June 21 release date. A launch event was held in GAME stores at Hamleys to celebrate the European release of the games. The event, held on July 26, 2007, offered a chance to purchase the games one day before their official release date and featured an appearance by band McFly. To celebrate the Australian release of the games, Nintendo launched the nationwide Nintendo DS Connection Tour 07; each stop in the tour featured events such as Pokémon Trading Card Game competitions and Pokémon trivia games.

The success of the games revived the popularity of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; brand. George Harrison, then Nintendo of America&#x27;s vice president of marketing, noted that the games were attracting &quot;players of all ages&quot;—from younger children to &quot;grown men and women&quot; and older players who &quot;played the original &quot;Pokémon&quot; games&quot;. As a result, Pokémon USA opened a temporary boutique in the Times Square Toys &quot;R&quot; Us that sold exclusively &quot;Pokémon&quot; licensed merchandise including Jakks Pacific-created action figures, plush toys, backpacks, and clothing. Ronald Boire, president of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, stated that the store planned to open temporary boutiques in all 585 of its domestic locations. Other &quot;Pokémon&quot; merchandise included a BattleDome Playset and a talking Pokédex. Additionally, Pokémon USA partnered with Burger King in 2008 to launch a promotional campaign in which Burger King included exclusive &quot;Pokémon&quot; trading cards and accessories with Kids Meals. The promotion lasted from July 7 to August 3 in the United States and continued through the fall internationally.

===&quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot;===

 is the third version after &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It was released on September 13, 2008, in Japan, March 22, 2009, in North America, May 14, 2009, in Australia, and May 22, 2009, in Europe.

&quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot; has been met with generally positive reception, holding aggregate scores of 84 and 83.14% at Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. It was praised for the additions and changes made to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; by publications such as &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot;, though it has been criticized for being too similar to them. &quot;IGN&quot; included it as the ninth-best Nintendo DS game ever made, as well as nominating it as one of the best DS role-playing games of 2009. It was the fastest-selling game in Japan at the time, shifting 7.6 million copies overall.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; garnered slightly higher ratings than &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; and &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The highest score given was a 92 by UK &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;, while the lowest was a 67 by &quot;Game Revolution&quot;. Official Nintendo Magazine would later go on to rank the game 20th in a list of the greatest Nintendo games. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the games an 8.5/10, &quot;Great&quot;, and called the games &quot;the most well-rounded &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to date.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameZone&quot; also gave the games an 8.5/10. The UK &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; gave the games 92%, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; gave them a 4.5/5. The games received slightly lower reviews from &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot; than &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; had, but earned an &quot;A−&quot; grade from &quot;1UP.com&quot;, an improvement from &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;″s &quot;B−&quot;.

Most reviewers felt that though the gameplay and storyline had not changed much since the first games, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were still engaging. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s a little surprising how well the formula holds up in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, which is a testament to the strong fundamentals of the series as well as the quality of the execution.&quot; The games&#x27; Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. &quot;1UP.com&quot; called the addition of wireless connectivity the games&#x27; &quot;biggest improvements&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system &quot;robust&quot; and &quot;probably the most significant new feature.&quot; &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot; said of the Global Trade Center, &quot;Suddenly, &quot;Pokémon&quot; feels properly alive for the first time since playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in the late &#x27;90s – and you&#x27;ll instantly forgive Game Freak their technical stubbornness the first time you switch on your DS and find the level 100 Munchlax you craved is on your cart.&quot;

The graphics generally received positive reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the blend of 2D and 3D graphics, and &quot;GameZone&quot; said that the graphics were &quot;better than what I had originally imagined&quot; and that &quot;a &quot;Pokemon&quot; title hasn&#x27;t ever looked this good on a handheld.&quot; &quot;GameSpy&quot; felt that the graphics, though simple, made the game &quot;a pleasure to explore&quot;. &quot;ComputerAndVideoGames.com&quot;, however, said that &quot;the so-called &#x27;3D&#x27; isn&#x27;t up to much: it&#x27;s just a viewpoint shuffle, with DS&#x27;s gutsy engine taking a nice long nap between the odd hypnotic windfarm or fog effect.&quot; The audio was not so well-received: &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the cries made by the Pokémon &quot;still screech with the flair of the original Game Boy&quot; and that the music, while &quot;more advanced&quot;, was &quot;not much beyond [Game Boy Advance] quality&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot; also felt that the sounds had not been updated, saying &quot;This [the audio] is the only area that hasn&#x27;t taken one step forward. It remains stagnant and doesn&#x27;t show any progression over the GBA titles&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; cited the games&#x27; &quot;recycled&quot; sounds as one of the negative points.

===Sales===
First released in Japan in 2006, &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; have the most successful launch week of games in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, and the best launch week for any Nintendo DS game for the country alone. Within forty-six days, the games sold three million units, becoming the fastest DS games to do so; by the end of the year, the number increased to five million units in just under three months, making &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; the best-selling &quot;Pokémon&quot; games in Japan. In the United States, pre-orders for &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; passed 533,000, almost twice the pre-sale numbers for &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. Within five days of release, the games sold around one million copies and were the fastest-selling &quot;Pokémon&quot; games ever until the release of &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot;. The games were the seventh-best-selling video games of 2007, with around 4.27 million units sold in the United States; in early 2009 sales passed 5.3 million units. As of September 30, 2017, &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; combined have sold 17.67 million copies worldwide, making their sales totals around one million higher than those of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; and around six million higher than those of &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;. The games also boosted sales of hardware in the United States, spurring the sales of 471,000 DS units and causing the sales of video games in April 2007 to rise 20% from April 2006. In Europe, the games sold around 1.6 million units within just seven weeks of their release and topped the charts in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, there have been more than 10 million Pokémon trades via Wi-Fi.

===Awards===
At G4&#x27;s G-phoria 2007, the games won &quot;Best Handheld Game&quot;, and were nominated for &quot;Best RPG&quot;. In 2008 &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were nominated for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Children&#x27;s Kids Vote Award. In &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best of 2007 Awards, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were named the best Nintendo DS online multiplayer games and the best Nintendo DS RPG games of the year. In the 2006 &quot;Famitsu&quot; Game Awards, &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; won the Best Hit award and tied with &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; for the Game of the Year award.

Competitive battling in &quot;Pokémon&quot; became much more popular with &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;. The physical special split allowed Pokémon such as Gengar and Gyarados to use their higher attacking stat and gave special/physical coverage moves to formerly all-physical/special types, and online play made Pokémon battling possible all over the world.

===Remakes and Prequel===
&quot;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&quot; and &quot;Shining Pearl&quot; are enhanced remakes of the games and were released for the Nintendo Switch on November 19, 2021. &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; is an action role-playing game which serves as a prequel to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; and is set in an older version of the Sinnoh region known as the Hisui region. It was released for the Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022. Both games were initially revealed in a &quot;Pokémon Presents&quot; presentation on February 26, 2021.

&quot;Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl&quot; were produced by ILCA, and acted as &quot;faithful&quot; remakes to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, with the addition of game mechanics introduced in later titles. The games were released to &quot;mixed&quot; or average reviews, with positivity being directed towards its faithful nature, and criticism towards the lack of &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot; features and how the game handled newer features being meshed with older ones. Additionally, its graphics art-style, which made characters in the overworld resemble &quot;chibis&quot; received mixed responses from critics. As of May 2022, the games had sold over fourteen million copies.

&quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus,&quot; while maintaining core gameplay mechanics, changed how the overworld was traversed, with players being able to freely explore five different areas or &quot;biomes&quot; of Hisui. Players can actively interact with Pokémon in the overworld, with hostile Pokémon capable of attacking and injuring the player character. Players can engage with Pokémon in battle from the overworld. The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; from critics, with many praising the new gameplay style and direction, with criticism being directed towards the game&#x27;s art-style. The game was nominated for Best RPG at The Game Awards. By May 2022, the game had shifted over twelve million copies.

<doc id="1083196" wikidata="Q2788343" url="?curid=1083196" title="Lulu (Final Fantasy)">
<text>is a character from Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and one of the main playable characters of the 2001 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. She acts as a guardian to the game&#x27;s protagonist Yuna, and accompanies her on a mission to defeat the creature Sin. As a Black Mage, Lulu represents a recurring character class in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, and fights using offensive magic spells or by animating small stuffed animals that strike on her behalf. Lulu was designed by series artist Tetsuya Nomura, who wanted to create a character that differed in appearance from other Black Mages in the franchise. Accordingly, her outfit took advantage of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s improved graphics: it features an intricate dress that utilizes several belts in its skirt. Lulu later appears as a side character in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, where she is shown to have had a child. In the original Japanese version she is voiced by Rio Natsuki, while in the English dub she is voiced by Paula Tiso.

Lulu has received mostly positive reception since her debut. She has been a popular character with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fans and cosplay enthusiasts in particular, while media outlets have recognized her attractiveness and sex appeal. However, Lulu was also criticized by certain reviewers who associated her design with sadomasochistic imagery and fetish culture. Her personality and role in the storyline received greater praise from critics who saw her as the most level-headed figure among the playable cast and one of the better-voiced characters in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Other outlets enjoyed the evolution of her character arc and her motherly demeanor.

==Conception and design==
Lulu was designed by Tetsuya Nomura for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. She is classified as a Black Mage, a type of spellcaster in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise that specializes in the use of offensive magic. Nomura wanted to create a character that was different from how Black Mages were portrayed in previous games, and to this end he gave her a unique outfit and hairstyle. The centerpiece of her outfit a low-cut, fur-lined, dark grey and black dress that displays her pronounced cleavage, while her hair is done in an upright bun. Lulu is 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall, and with her hair and high heels stands 173 cm (5 ft 8 in).

Taking into account the PlayStation 2&#x27;s improved graphics handling, Nomura opted to make his designs for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; &quot;super deep and detailed&quot;, feeling that he &quot;went kind of crazy&quot; on Lulu&#x27;s in particular. To complement her attire, he devised a series of belts that attached to her skirt in a certain order, and insisted that the 3D character modeler reproduce them to his exact specifications. Belts were a common feature of Nomura&#x27;s character designs at the time, and he stated when outside observers noticed the trend and teased him over it, it only encouraged him to utilize them more. However, the outfit&#x27;s complexity made it difficult to animate for cutscenes. The staff compromised by often only showing Lulu from the waist up, and excluded her from animated sequences involving complex motions.

In addition to her magic, Lulu can also utilize animated stuffed animals as weapons that attack on her behalf—a concept originally planned for inclusion in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Each is based on a recurring character in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, such as moogles and cactuars. When drawing her concept art, Nomura outlined a list of stuffed animals she would be able to use during the course of the game. However, one in particular, the Tonberry, was cut from the final game. Her strongest weapon, the Onion Knight, went through several drafts in the sketch phase, including one idea to have the sword and shield resemble onions. Instead, its finalized design incorporated a pixelated image of a &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; character with the class of the same name into its shield.

===Voice casting===
In English, Lulu is voiced by Paula Tiso, while in Japanese she is voiced by Rio Natsuki. Tiso stated that prior to recording she would watch the scenes first, which she felt made it easier for her to get into the mindset of the character. She found the task of voicing Lulu to be challenging nonetheless as the character was the &quot;exact opposite of bubbly and smiley&quot; voice work she was used to doing prior. To ease herself into the role, she had a chair brought in and did the voice recording from a seated position to allow her to give a more focused portrayal.

For her part, Natsuki appreciated that Lulu&#x27;s role in the plot was small, as she preferred projects where other characters could hold centre stage, something she felt was in line with Lulu&#x27;s personality. Originally, upon seeing Lulu&#x27;s early design, she thought the character was meant to be intimidating, and during the audition spoke in a deeper tone. After seeing her in-game, however, she found Lulu to be &quot;beautiful&quot;, and cited her choice of weapon as bringing an element of cuteness to her. An established voice actor, the development team were fans of her work, and she helped the less experienced voice actors during recording sessions. Natsuki grew particularly attached to voicing Lulu after seeing a scene wherein all the party members jumped off an airship, and she enjoyed collaborating with the other voice actors to create a sense of momentum and atmosphere when voicing the scene.

==Appearances==
Lulu is one of the playable characters introduced in Square Enix&#x27;s 2001 role playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. A Black Mage, she serves as an older sister figure to the game&#x27;s protagonist Yuna, whom she grew up with alongside the brothers Wakka and Chappu on their home of Besaid Island. When Yuna sets out on a pilgrimage to defeat the creature Sin, Lulu follows suit and travels with her as a guardian. During the course of the game it is revealed she had accompanied two other summoners on identical pilgrimages before, though both journeys ended abruptly. Lulu had been romantically involved with Chappu, and his death at the hands of Sin prior to the game&#x27;s events affected her greatly. She later falls in love with Wakka, and helps Yuna destroy Sin.

In the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, she was relegated to a supporting role due to game director Motomu Toriyama feeling her presence as a playable character would have undermined Yuna&#x27;s story, as the latter &quot;would have relied on her like an older sister and this would have got in the way of [Yuna&#x27;s] quest to find a new self&quot;. Lulu can instead be found in the game&#x27;s Besaid location married to Wakka, where they have a child together. Lulu later appears in both the sequel novel &quot;Final Fantasy 10-2.5 ~Eien no Daisho~&quot; and its audio drama followup, &quot;Final Fantasy 10 -Will-&quot;. Now the mayor of Besaid, after observing recent revivals of both dead people and extinct species, she surmises that Sin&#x27;s revival in the story was by similar means.

Outside the &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; titles, Lulu makes an appearance in several other games, including &quot;Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius&quot; and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;. Cards of the character have also been featured in the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;. In theatre, Lulu appears in the &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; kabuki stage play, where she is portrayed by Nakamura Baishi. In the play her dress was replaced with a fur-lined kimono to tie in to the theme of the production and follow a more Japanese aesthetic.

==Promotion and reception==

Several items of merchandise were produced to promote Lulu and her game of origin, including trading cards, wall scrolls, and plushies modeled after the effigies she uses in battle. In addition, several figurines were also produced, such as a 1/6th scale statue by ARTFX. Both regular and chibi bottle topper figurines were produced as part of a 2001 promotional campaign for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; by soda company Coca-Cola. In 2004 Trading Ars released a PVC statue of Lulu, posed in a reclining position with her lower body lying on the ground. Later on, a costume in the likeness of Lulu was included as part of a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-themed promotion for &quot;Gunslinger Stratos 2&quot;. A &quot;minion&quot; companion character of her that follows players around was also released as an in-game item for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;.

Lulu&#x27;s outfit drew particular focus from media outlets. Todd Hargosh of &quot;Game Industry News&quot; called it the strangest outfit he had ever seen and felt the belts made her &quot;look like a dominatrix. Daniel Żelazny of &quot;PPE&quot; named Lulu one his favorite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters due to how her appearance deviated from that of a typical Black Mage, thanks to her overt and complex dress. He added that the outfit was not only one of Nomura&#x27;s best creations, but also one of the best female character outfits in video games overall. Dave Smith of &quot;IGN&quot; opined that Lulu&#x27;s outfit was a positive outgrowth of Nomura&#x27;s penchant for overdressed characters, and that her design, with highlights such as &quot;[a] floor-length skirt, elaborately-pinned hair, and [a] collection of super-cute mascot dolls&quot;, was one of the &quot;coolest&quot; in the franchise. He additionally praised her personality as matching her fashion sense and conveying a &quot;beautifully menacing presence&quot;. Despite the complexity of Lulu&#x27;s clothing, she has been cited as a frequent subject of cosplay.

In 2009, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; called Lulu one of the sexiest video game characters of the last decade and attributed her appeal to her large breasts and outfit, the latter of which they described as an ensemble in the style of a &quot;goth-mage-hooker&quot; aesthetic that appeared ready to &quot;fall right off at any second&quot;. They acknowledged that her visual allure was equalled by her self-assured composure, and spoke favorably of both her protective nature and strength as a mage. Gus Turner of &quot;Complex&quot; echoed these sentiments and lauded the character&#x27;s &quot;smoky&quot; and &quot;sensual&quot; voice. He further praised her rational attitude towards the central revelations in the game&#x27;s story. Relatedly, the staff of &quot;GMR&quot; magazine felt she served as a &quot;calm presence&quot; among the original game&#x27;s cast, and added they would have preferred the &quot;sultry, dollhugging, goth mama&quot; to have been playable in &quot;X-2&quot; instead of the game&#x27;s actual cast. However, Gamasutra editor Kurt Kalata criticized her appearance as &quot;outlandish&quot; and called &quot;goth girl&quot; Lulu more akin to a &quot;fetish object&quot; than an inhabitant of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s world. Japanese magazine &quot;Game Criticism&quot; considered the fan service aspect of Lulu &quot;excessive&quot; and described her outfit as a &quot;S &amp; M straightjacket&quot;.

Damien Mecheri in the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy X&quot; argued that a well-rounded party in a roleplaying game is incomplete without a character who is &quot;a bit cold, dark, and taciturn&quot;, and commented that Lulu fit this archetype well. He compared her character design to Edea Kramer of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; in how both were built around &quot;bizarre features from the imagination of Tetsuya Nomura&quot;. Mecheri stated that, while her character was not particularly complex, he was drawn to the &quot;odd couple&quot; relationship she had with Wakka, and noted that her emotional maturity coupled with her youth brought a &quot;bit of wisdom to the [&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;] cast&quot;. Other commentators offered their own examination of her character&#x27;s part in the story. Paul Shkreli of &quot;RPGamer&quot; enjoyed Lulu&#x27;s personal evolution during the narrative and her willingness to question her core tenets, stating that &quot;Lulu&#x27;s irony is that her humanity is what makes her effective as a protector, not the other way around&quot;. Margaret David of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; believed that Lulu&#x27;s spoken dialogue enhanced her character and articulated her &quot;harsh but protective manner&quot; in a way text alone could not express. David felt that, without the voice acting, she would have potentially been remembered as an unlikable character instead of the &quot;dark horse fave&quot; she became.

According to Matt Sainsbury of &quot;DigitallyDownloaded.net&quot;, the novelty of Lulu&#x27;s design helped flesh out her role as a character, particularly as a Black Mage. He pointed out that previous entries in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series often presented such characters as &quot;mysterious, dark&quot; spellcasters able to wield destructive magic liberally, a depiction which was &quot;not really sufficient for the kind of characterisation needed in modern JRPG storytelling&quot;. Sainsbury claimed that, while Lulu&#x27;s outward appearance seemingly upheld that trend by invoking imagery of sadomasochism, her actual portrayal as a severe but motherly figure contrasted his expectations and gave her depth without compromising her image. He singled out such subversions in character design as a particular attraction of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games as a whole.

<text>Frank Stuart Flint (19 December 1885 – 28 February 1960) was an English poet and translator who was a prominent member of the Imagist group. Ford Madox Ford called him &quot;one of the greatest men and one of the beautiful spirits of the country&quot;.

==Life and career==
Flint was a British poet and poetry reviewer with an unusual gift for language. A self-educated man born in Islington, London, Flint left school at 13 and worked in various capacities before beginning his long and distinguished career in the Civil Service in 1904. He published a book on French poets, starting in 1908 and by 1910, his intensive private study had gained him recognition as one of Britain&#x27;s most highly informed authorities on modern French poetry. His first collection of poems, &quot;In the Net of the Stars&quot; (1909), consisted mainly of conventional love lyrics.

Flint is mostly known for his participation in the &quot;School of Images&quot; with Ezra Pound and T. E. Hulme in 1909, of which he gave an account in the &quot;Poetry Review&quot; in 1909, and which was to serve as the theoretical basis for the later Imagist movement (1913). His subsequent association with Ezra Pound and T. E. Hulme, together with his deepening knowledge of innovative French poetic techniques, radically affected his poetry&#x27;s development.

Glenn Hughes reports Flint claiming to invent the open verse form &#x27;unrhymed cadence&#x27;, by cutting away all personal emotion, where symbolism was barely suggested, but instead shortened and hardened, and where meter was supplanted by cadence&#x27;.
Hughes explaining Flint&#x27;s form is best understood &#x27;by comparing his poem &#x27; A Swan Song&#x27;(Published in 1909 and later by Pound in 1914 in &#x27;Des Imagistes&#x27;) and, his later &#x27;cadenced &#x27; version thereof, &#x27; The Swan&#x27;, a poem so devoid of superfluities and cliches, to achieve that perfect chiseled beauty which is the essence of classical art&#x27;

In 1916 Flint was described as having &#x27; the gift of artistic courage clothed in beauty which will help build the poetry of the future&#x27;. Flint himself, considered his &#x27;cadenced&#x27; form to be a reversion to the real tradition of the English poetry of Cynewulf in the &#x27;Riddle, The Nightingale&#x27;

Earlier Flint had published a series of articles on contemporary French poets (1912) that much influenced his contemporaries. In 1914 he was included by Pound in Des Imagistes. He entered into a short-lived dispute with Pound as to each one&#x27;s relative contribution to the Imagist movement.

During the 1930s Flint was among a number of poets who moved away from poetry and towards economics, working for the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Labour writing that &quot;[t]he proper study of mankind is, for the time being, economics&quot;. Flint would go on to publish an article entitled &quot;The Plain Man and Economics&quot; in &quot;The Criterion&quot; in 1937. He became a leading spokesman for Imagism and exemplified its methods in the concentration and clarity displayed by much of the work in Cadences (1915). &quot;Otherworld&quot;, his third and last collection, was published in 1920, its lengthy title poem responding to the desolation of the First World War in its meditations on more viable modes of existence. For some years after he ceased publishing poetry, Flint continued to contribute influential articles to the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The Criterion&quot;. He was also a prolific translator of prose works and poetry by French, German, and classical authors.

With the exception of some short works arising from his activities as a civil servant, he ceased writing for publication entirely in the early 1930s.

<text>Skipwith Cannell (1887–1957) was an American poet associated with the Imagist group. His surname is pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. He was a friend of William Carlos Williams, and like Ezra Pound he came from Philadelphia. Cannell studied at the University of Virginia and was enthusiastic about the work of Edgar Allan Poe and the free verse of The King James Version of The Bible. He was briefly married to Kathleen Eaton Cannell, who was generally known as &#x27;Kitty&#x27;.

Cannell met Pound in Paris in 1913. Pound sent some of Cannell&#x27;s poems to Harriet Monroe. Back in London, Pound took Cannell and Kitty to visit Yeats and found a room for the couple below his own in Church Walk, Kensington.

Cannell&#x27;s work appeared in the first Imagist anthology, edited by Pound and published by Poetry Bookshop in 1914 &quot;Des Imagistes&quot; and &quot;The New Poetry: An Anthology&quot;, edited by Harriet Monroe and Alice Corbin Henderson in 1917.

Cannell and Kitty divorced in 1921. There were no children from this first marriage. Cannell married secondly Juliette Del Grange, a French national with whom he had two daughters, May and Sarah. His second marriage also ended in divorce. He married a third time to Catherine Pettigrew, with whom he had five additional children, David, Mary, Michael, John and Susan.

He was closely involved with Alfred Kreymborg&#x27;s magazine &quot;&quot;.

<text>Lord &amp; Taylor was the oldest-surviving department store chain in the United States. The company operated full-line department stores from 1826 until it filed for bankruptcy in 2020. The following year, in 2021, it closed all its brick-and-mortar stores. Saadia Group acquired the Lord &amp; Taylor intellectual property and relaunched the e-commerce website later that same year. However, due to financial challenges, Saadia went into default in March 2024. In September 2024, Regal Brands Global acquired the Lord &amp; Taylor intellectual property.

==History==
===Under the Lord family, 1826–1916===
English-born Samuel Lord started a dry goods business in New York City in 1824 and opened the original store that would become Lord &amp; Taylor in 1826, on Catherine Street in what is now Two Bridges, Manhattan. The shop stocked hosiery, misses&#x27; wear, and cashmere shawls. His wife&#x27;s cousin, George Washington Taylor, joined in 1834, and the store was named Lord &amp; Taylor. The store continued to grow: it annexed 49 Catherine Street in 1832 and moved six years later to 61–63 Catherine Street. James S. Taylor, Lord&#x27;s brother-in-law, replaced George Taylor in 1845. The company erected a new building at Grand and Chrystie Streets in 1853 and moved into that location the following year. Lord later named his son John T. Lord and his employee John S. Lyle as partners in the enterprise.

On August 29, 1859, Lord &amp; Taylor opened a second store on Broadway at Grand Street in the modern-day SoHo neighborhood, keeping the older store open. The new store was described as a &quot;five-story marble emporium&quot; and was among Broadway&#x27;s first major new department stores since the A.T. Stewart building at 280 Broadway was completed in 1846. At the same time, Lord &amp; Taylor started participating in wholesaling. Lord retired in 1862. Samuel Lord Jr. and George Washington Taylor Lord succeeded the original partners in leading the company.

In 1870, the Broadway store moved uptown to a new cast-iron building at Broadway and 20th Street, in the area known as the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Mile&quot;. This store was designed by James H. Giles and included one of the first steam-powered passenger elevators. The new store expanded around 1890 by annexing a building to the east. Lord &amp; Taylor faced economic troubles after the Panic of 1873, though the original partners gave the company &quot;a large loan&quot; in 1879. By 1894, the company was fast-growing and would open stores on Fifth Avenue in 1903 and 1906. The downtown store continued to function, expanded through to Forsyth Street and advertised until at least 1887 as a new building. Samuel Lord&#x27;s estate sold the Grand Street store in 1901.

The Lord &amp; Taylor Building, the Starrett &amp; van Vleck-designed Fifth Avenue store and headquarters opened between 38th and 39th streets on February 24, 1914. It touted many modern improvements, including an electric delivery vehicle garage; elevator and hidden conveyor systems for moving goods, people, showcases, and trash, and for loading and unloading trucks; and an on-site electrical generation and heating system. The Broadway store was quickly sold after the new store opened on March 26. The new store became a New York City Landmark on October 30, 2007.

Lord &amp; Taylor announced in November 1915 that it would sell off its wholesale business.

===Under Associated Dry Goods, 1916–1986===
A founding unit of Associated Dry Goods, Lord &amp; Taylor was considered to be its crown jewel.

In 1945, Dorothy Shaver became the first woman to head a major retail establishment in the United States as president of Lord &amp; Taylor. As vice president working with the well-known design firm of Raymond Loewy Associates, she opened what is credited as the first-ever branch store, in Manhasset, New York. Unlike earlier forays into the suburbs that consisted of smaller boutique-style shops, this merchandising effort became the model for modern suburban shopping. The store consisted of 66 individual shops. Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s relationship with Raymond Loewy Associates continued until 1969, following the construction of the Stamford, Connecticut store (designed by Loewy Vice President Andrew Geller). Many of Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s special services, including personal shoppers, were introduced while Shaver presided. During this period she introduced the Andrew Geller handwritten logo and the American Beauty Rose as icons of the store. Shaver died in 1959.

William J. Lippincott was elected chairman and chief executive in 1972. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; read: &quot;In his years as president and chairman, Lord &amp; Taylor moved beyond its traditional territory in the northeast to open stores in Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas and four stores in Illinois.&quot; A management shakeup ousted him in 1976.

Under the leadership of CEO Joseph E. Brooks during the 1970s, the company aggressively expanded into Texas, Illinois, and Michigan; throughout the 1980s, South Florida saw 11 stores opened in quick succession.

===Under May Department Stores Company, 1986–2005===
When the May Company acquired ADG in 1986, it was assumed that May bought it just for the luxury division.

The chain partially withdrew from the oil-shocked Texas and southern Florida markets in 1989–1990 after its 1986 acquisition by May. Under May, the upscale Hahne &amp; Co., Wanamaker&#x27;s, and Woodward &amp; Lothrop chains were refitted and converted into Lord &amp; Taylor.

Jane T. Elfers became Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s second female president in June 2000. Former Neiman Marcus executive, Brendan Hoffman replaced her in October 2008, when Elfer&#x27;s contract had expired. A third female president, Bonnie Brooks, took over in 2011, and a fourth female president, Liz Rodbell, took over in 2013.
Federated Department Stores acquired May Department Stores in 2005. On January 12, 2006, Federated chairman, president, and CEO Terry Lundgren announced that Lord &amp; Taylor would be sold by the end of the year. Federated announced on March 10, 2006, that six Lord &amp; Taylor locations would be sold or downscale into Macy&#x27;s. The legendary Center City, Philadelphia store, the former flagship of the John Wanamaker chain, opened after a one-month renovation as Macy&#x27;s City Center on August 1, 2006.

===Under NRDC Equity Partners, 2006–2008===
On June 22, 2006, NRDC Equity Partners, LLC announced it would purchase Lord &amp; Taylor for $1.2 billion after Federated converted and sold the previously announced locations; the sale was completed in October 2006. Federated continued to service Lord &amp; Taylor consumer credit accounts in an agreement with NRDC under the terms of its sale until mid-2007.

===Under Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, 2008–2019===
On July 16, 2008, NRDC Equity Partners announced that it had purchased the 338-year-old Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) for an undisclosed price to expand internationally and positioned Lord &amp; Taylor under HBC. The combined HBC, as of February 2018, consisted of Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Home Outfitters in Canada, Galeria Kaufhof in Germany, and Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue in the United States.

HBC committed to spending an additional $250 million upgrading stores. The Fifth Avenue flagship store received a $150 million ($ in ) update in 2010. In 2011, an ultra-modern concept store opened in Westchester County at the new Ridge Hill Mall. During this time, locations such as Manhasset, Garden City, Bala Cynwyd, Eastchester, and Stamford all saw ultra-modern style renovations and upgrades. In 2012, a large outpost opened at The Mall at Rockingham Park. In 2013, a contemporary-style outpost opened at Mizner Park in Boca Raton, Florida. In 2014, a $20 million ($ in ) contemporary outpost, modeled after the Boca Raton location, opened at Crossgates Mall near Albany, NY. Around this time, a store was announced to open alongside Saks Fifth Avenue in the luxury wing of the American Dream Mall. In March 2017, Lord &amp; Taylor partnered with Brideside.com to launch an in-store bridal shop.In April 2017, Lord &amp; Taylor completed a $12 million ($ in ) renovation plan at the Fifth Avenue store. In October 2017, after an attempt made to build a skyscraper above the Fifth Avenue store, it was announced the building would be sold in a joint partnership to WeWork for $850 million ($ in ). WeWork was set to occupy the uppermost floors of the building, with the rest remaining a flagship space for Lord &amp; Taylor. This was part of a trend on Wall Street to maximize profits and real estate value. In February 2019, the sale completed for $725 million ($ in ) in cash and the remainder in equity, forming a joint venture with Lord &amp; Taylor as minority owners. Industry observers connected the sale of the flagship store to intense activist investors and opportunity seen to monetize real estate at HBC.

On April 1, 2018, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gave notice of the theft of customers&#x27; credit and debit cards due to a hacking incident. A hacking group known as JokerStash or Fin7 attempted to sell the information from five million stolen customer credentials on dark web sites during the last week of March 2018. The company noted that most compromised records were from Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue customers. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company noted that customers would not be liable for any charges incurred due to this breach, and they will offer no-cost credit report monitoring and identity protection services.

In May 2018, Walmart began carrying Lord &amp; Taylor fashions on their website to modernize Walmart and position it more upscale. This was a bold move praised by many as being innovative.

===Under Le Tote, 2019–2020===

In August 2019, Le Tote, Inc. purchased the retailer for million ($75 million) in cash on closing and an additional million ($25 million) two years later. HBC was to get a 25% equity stake in Le Tote. The buyer would retain the stores&#x27; inventory, with an estimated value of million. The deal, expected to close before year-end, required HBC to pay the stores&#x27; rent for at least three years, at an estimated million ($58 million) cash per year. The acquisition was completed in November 2019.

In November 2019, the sale to Le Tote was finalized and it was reported that all 38 Lord &amp; Taylor brick-and-mortar locations would transfer ownership.

====Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic====

Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s stores were forced to close due to executive state orders by the local and state governments on non-essential retail by Wednesday, March 18, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While it took some time for the locations to reopen to the public, some of its closed U.S. stores were looted following the murder of George Floyd.
Lord &amp; Taylor began the process of reopening on Friday, May 15, 2020, with two of its locations in Florida and New Hampshire allowed to reopen. All stores resumed operations by July 3, 2020.

On August 2, 2020, Lord &amp; Taylor and Le Tote had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On August 3, it was reported that the company would simultaneously solicit bids for its Le Tote and Lord &amp; Taylor businesses. That very same date, Lord &amp; Taylor announced that it would close 19 stores and then added another 5 locations to the list on August 20. Finally on August 27, Lord &amp; Taylor announced that it would close all of its stores and go out of business after almost 200 years. It had 38 stores at the time of the announcement.

On October 15, 2020, Saadia Group, LLC announced it would acquire Lord &amp; Taylor which would then transform the retailer into a digital first format. On Saturday, February 27, 2021, the remaining 19 stores closed.

=== Saadia Group, 2020 - 2024 ===

In October 2020, the investment firm Saadia Group acquired Lord &amp; Taylor; they transformed the retailer into a digital-first format. In fall 2022, an ad campaign called &quot;Fall Fete&quot; debuted alongside a new logo. However, Saadia Group faced financial difficulties leading to a default on their obligations.

=== Regal Brands Global, 2024 ===
In 2024, Regal Brands Global acquired the intellectual property of Lord &amp; Taylor. &quot;Business of Fashion&quot; reported in December that Regal plans to bring back the brand as an online discount luxury retailer, along with selling licensed Lord &amp; Taylor branded products which will be distributed online and in department stores. There are plans for the return of physical stores, however these are longterm plans.

==SaksWorks==
In August 2021, it was announced that SaksWorks, a partnership with WeWork and a spinoff of the Saks Fifth Avenue brand, would provide co-working spaces for technology startups and services for other enterprises. It was predicted that SaksWorks would fill about 90% of the former Lord &amp; Taylor brick-and-mortar locations since Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company still owned the real estate of the properties.

<doc id="1083222" wikidata="Q940132" url="?curid=1083222" title="Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda">
<text>Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda (1490 – 17 November 1573) was a Spanish humanist, philosopher, and theologian of the Spanish Renaissance. He is mainly known for his participation in a famous debate with Bartolomé de las Casas in Valladolid, Spain, in 1550–1551. The debate centered on the legitimacy of the conquest and colonization of America by the Spanish Empire and on the treatment of the Native Americans. The main philosophical referents of Ginés de Sepúlveda were Aristotle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Roman law and Christian theology. These influences allowed him to argue for the cultural superiority and domination of the Spanish over the Native Americans during the period of the conquest.

==Biography==
Sepúlveda was born in 1490 at Pozoblanco in the Córdoba province of Spain. He came from a humble background, his parents were Ginés Sánchez Mellado, a craftsman, and María Ruiz. In 1510 he enrolled at the University of Alcalá de Henares, where he studied philosophy and Greek. In 1513 he began studying theology at the College of San Antonio de Sigüenza. Then, in February 1515, he obtained a letter of recommendation from Cardinal Cisneros to attend the prestigious Spanish College in Bologna, Italy, known for its studies in canon law and theology.

In September 1515, Sepúlveda matriculated into the Spanish College where he studied theology and philosophy. Under the tutelage of Pietro Pomponazzi he developed a lifelong appreciation and expertise for the works of Aristotle. While in Bologna, he enjoyed the friendship and patronage of Alberto Pío, Prince of Carpi, and also met Giulio de&#x27; Medici who would later become Pope Clement VII. Both men encouraged Sepúlveda to study Aristotle. In the next several years, he translated several of the philosophers works from Greek to Latin, including &quot;Parva Naturalia&quot;, 1522; &quot;De ortu et interitu&quot;, 1523; &quot;De mundo&quot;, 1523; and &quot;Meteorum&quot;, 1532.

By 1523, Sepúlveda had earned doctorates in arts and theology. He also took religious vows and became a Dominican priest. After Medici became Pope Clement VII in 1523, Sepúlveda served at the papal curia in Rome where he developed a reputation for scholarship and rhetorical skills. He wrote several short works regarding contemporary religious controversies. In 1526 he penned &quot;De fato et libero arbitrio&quot; against Martin Luther, &quot;De ritu nuptiarum&quot; in 1531 against Henry VIII&#x27;s divorce proceedings, and &quot;Antapologia&quot; against Erasmus in 1532. He despised Luther and strongly disagreed with his theology, but Sepúlveda respected Erasmus and despite their disagreements, they continued to correspond for many years.

He also used his rhetorical skills 1529 to write &quot;Ad Carolum V&quot;, urging the Habsburg emperor Charles V to unite Europe and fight the Turks. In &quot;Democrates&quot; (1535) he defended the concept that a just war based on natural law was compatible with Christianity.

He was the adversary of Bartolomé de las Casas in the Valladolid Controversy in 1550 concerning the justification of the Spanish Conquest of the Indies. Sepúlveda was the defender of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s right of conquest, of colonization, of forced conversion in the New World, and a supporter of colonial slavery. He argued on the base of natural law philosophy and developed a position which was different from the position of the School of Salamanca, as represented famously by Francisco de Vitoria.

===Spanish colonization of the Americas===

Sepúlveda was inspired by Aristotelian philosophy, especially his ideas about the natural hierarchy and the superiority of human beings over other species. He used these concepts to argue that Native Americans were &quot;barbaric&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; by nature and therefore justified their subjugation by the Spanish Empire. Sepúlveda also drew on the theology and philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who argued that there were different degrees of perfection and that some human beings were naturally superior to others. Sepúlveda applied these principles to justify the domination of the Native Americans by the Spanish Empire. Sepúlveda used too concepts from Roman law, especially the idea of just war theory and the right of conquest, to argue that the colonization of the Americas by the Spanish Empire was legally and morally justified. Sepúlveda also appealed to the Bible and Christian theology to justify the forced conversion of Native Americans to Christianity and their subjugation by the Spanish Empire. He interpreted biblical passages and Christian doctrines in support of his position.

The Valladolid Debate was organized by King Charles V to give an answer to the question whether the indigenous peoples of the Americas were capable of self-governance, during the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

Sepúlveda defended the position of the colonists, although he had never been to America, claiming that some Amerindians were &quot;natural slaves&quot; as defined by Aristotle in Book I of &quot;Politics&quot;. &quot;Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus.&quot; He said these natives are &quot;as children to parents, as women are to men, as cruel people are from mild people&quot;. These assertions in regard to some but not all Amerindians were made in &quot;Democrates alter de justis belli causis apud Indos&quot; (&quot;A Second Democrates: on the just causes of war with Indians&quot;) Rome, 1550. Although Aristotle was a primary source for Sepúlveda&#x27;s argument, he also pulled from various Christian and other classical sources, including the Bible. 

Las Casas utilized the same sources in his counterargument. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, God had power over all people in the world, including those who had never heard of Christianity. However, he thought that Christianity should be presented to natives as a religious option, not an obligation as Sepulveda believed. Las Casas said that Amerindians ought to enjoy the same freedoms as any other people because, in his view, no Amerindians lacked the ability to rule themselves.

<doc id="1083223" wikidata="Q1069474" url="?curid=1083223" title="Opel Rekord">
<text>The Opel Rekord is a large family car which was built in eight generations by the German car manufacturer Opel. Between 1953 and 1986, approximately ten million were sold.

The Series D and E Rekords also spawned derivative versions manufactured by Opel&#x27;s British sister company Vauxhall and in the case of the Rekord E, GM&#x27;s Australian arm Holden. In 1986, the Rekord nameplate was replaced by the Opel Omega.

==Naming==
The Rekord name evolved into the main name of the model; at first the name was used in close relationship with the Opel Olympia name, which pre-dated the Rekord but was also reinstated in a separate model in 1967.

The various generations are described here with the manufacturer&#x27;s, or other commonly used designations such as &quot;Rekord P I&quot; or &quot;Rekord B&quot;. The car was not badged with these additional appellations.

==Olympia Rekord (1953–1957)==

The Opel Olympia Rekord was introduced in March 1953 as successor to the Opel Olympia, a pre-World War II design dating back to 1935. The Opel Olympia Rekord was built until 1957 in four different versions. Around 580,000 units were produced. Styling of the 1953–54 sedans resembled scaled-down versions of the contemporary Chevrolet in the U.S. Both cars were of course, products of General Motors.

*1953/54: 1488 cc, . Available as two-door saloon, cabriolet and estate &quot;(Caravan)&quot;. Price in Germany: DM 6,410 to 6,710. 136,028 units made.
*1955: 1488 cc, . Mild facelift, comprising larger rear window, new grille insert. New base model called simply Olympia; a delivery, based on the saloon, was also introduced. Price in Germany: DM 5,850 to 6,710. 131,586 units made.
*1956: 1488 cc, . New grille insert, bumpers now without guards. Price in Germany: DM 5,410 to 6,560. 144,587 units made.
*1957: 1488 cc, . New grille insert again, flatter roof, chrome strips along belt line. The cabriolet was no longer part of the line. Prices in Germany: DM 5,510 to 6,560. 169,721 units made.

==Rekord P1 (July 1957 – July 1960)==

The Opel (Olympia) Rekord P1 had a slightly larger, more modern body with wraparound windscreen and rear screen, introducing to Germany the latest American fashion of two-tone paintwork.

The standard model was sold as the Opel Olympia Rekord, while a reduced specification version was marketed simply as the Opel Olympia and widely known, less formally, as the &quot;Bauern-Buick&quot; &quot;(Peasant&#x27;s Buick)&quot;.

A new base version with an 1196 cc engine appeared in 1959 badged more simply as the Opel 1200, and replacing the Opel Olympia.

A semi-automatic gearbox (&quot;Olymat&quot;) became available for model year 1959. Initially the car retained the 1488 cc, of its predecessor: this was complemented by a 1680 cc, 55 PS;L engine for model year 1960.

The PI remained in production until 1960.

* 1958–59: 1488 cc, . Available as two-door &quot;Olympia&quot; base model or more luxurious two-door &quot;Olympia Rekord&quot; and as three-door estate (&quot;Caravan&quot;) and &quot;delivery&quot; van based on the saloon. Price in Germany: DM 5,785 to 6,845. 509,110 units were made.
* 1959: 1488 cc, ; on request 1680 cc, . Also available as four-door saloon. Several refinements including padded dashboard, ignition lock, electrically driven windscreen wipers. The new base model &quot;Opel 1200&quot; replaced the former Olympia (1196 cc, , DM 5,835); the 1200 remained in production until December 1962, while the P I was superseded in August 1960 by the Rekord P II.

Price in Germany: DM 6,545 to 7,110. 307,000 units (P I) + 67.952 units (1200). In 1959–60, Karosseriebau Autenrieth of Darmstadt, Germany converted P I two-door sedans to coupés and cabriolets, in very limited numbers. Prices were DM 9,380 for the coupé and DM 11,180 for the convertible.

==Rekord P2 (1960–1963)==

The Opel Rekord P2 grew in size, if not in wheelbase, and received a totally new body that did away with wraparound windows. It was available in several body versions: 2-door and 4-door saloon, a 3-door estate (&quot;Caravan&quot;) plus delivery van, a pick-up, and a convertible. From August 1961 on, a works coupé became available, and in June 1962 a more luxurious &quot;L&quot; version was added with a new top engine of 1700 cc &quot;S&quot; and a higher compression ratio. The latest versions had an optional four-speed gearbox.

Prices in Germany: DM 6,545 to 7,770. 787,684 units made. Autenrieth continued to sell a handful of convertibles at DM 11,635.

==Rekord A (1963–1965)==

The Rekord A line-up was a repeat of the Rekord P II (two- and four-door saloon, two-door estate and delivery van, two-door coupé with 1500 or 1700 or 1700 S engines), but the bodies were completely new and the wheelbase stretched to . March 1964 saw the introduction of the Rekord L-6 with the Opel Kapitän&#x27;s 2.6-litre inline-six.

Prices in Germany: DM 6,830 to 9,370; front disc brakes: + DM 200, four-speed with floor shift: + DM 180. In total, 885,292 units were built. In very limited numbers, Karl Deutsch of Cologne sold a convertible version with either the 1700 S or the 2600 engine, at DM 11,765 and 13,060 respectively.

==Rekord B (1965–1966)==

A transition model, the Rekord B offered only a mild facelift of the A but allowed Opel to avoid delay in introducing its new, more oversquare four-cylinder cam-in-head (CIH) engines (1500, 1700 S, 1900 S). The CIH engines were used in all subsequent Rekord generations until 1986, when the Rekord was replaced by the Opel Omega. The 2.6-litre six-cylinder engine remained unchanged. The line-up was identical to the Rekord A.

Prices in Germany: DM 6,980 to 9,570; power brakes: + DM 95, automatic gearbox: + 950, four-speed gearbox: + 95. 296,771 units.

==Rekord C (1966–1971)==

The Rekord C was produced in a wide variety of body styles and inline four- and six-cylinder engines. It was reliable, roomy, and pleasant to look at with its stylish coke-bottle line. A solid hit with the public, its 1,276,681 units sold made it the most successful Rekord to date. 

The range consisted of the two- and four-door saloon, two- and (new) four-door estate, delivery van, and two-door hardtop coupé with 1500, 1700, 1700 S, 1900 S fours or (until 1968) a 2200 six. Very short-lived (1967 only) was a special taxi version on a longer wheelbase (113 inch) with division, that sold for DM 9,950; with it, Opel tried to get a foothold in the German taxi market, then (as now) dominated by Mercedes-Benz. Again, Karl Deutsch of Cologne offered a convertible version in limited numbers.

There existed several variations of the Rekord C, as well as version made under different names in different countries.

The former Rekord L-6 was replaced by the new Commodore A, a slightly disguised and better-equipped Rekord C available as two- and four-door sedan and hardtop coupé with six-cylinder engines only.

It was during the life of this model (in fact 1967–70) that the Opel Olympia name was revived, but in a separate, smaller car which was based on the period Opel Kadett.

After the launch of the smaller Ascona in September 1970, the Ascona supplanted some of the lower-cost versions of the Rekord and the smallest, 1.5-litre engine was discontinued.

===Ranger===
The Ranger was a Rekord-based range built at the Opel Continental plant in Antwerp, Belgium, for the overall European market. Styling was similar to the Rekord, although the Ranger had a four-headlamp grille setup, similar to the Vauxhall Victor FD range of the time. Initially, there were two models: Ranger 130 and Ranger 153. In 1970 additional models were announced, being the Ranger 1900 and Ranger 2500, and a &quot;SS&quot; variant, based on the Ranger 153.

There was also a South African Ranger, built in General Motors South Africa&#x27;s plant Port Elizabeth. Known as &#x27;South Africa&#x27;s Own Car&#x27;, it featured a springbok logo on its grille, and was also produced as a station wagon.

===Other markets===
The Rekord C was built as Chevrolet Opala and Comodoro in Brazil from 1968 onward, available in saloon, coupé and estate forms and featuring either Chevrolet&#x27;s 2.5 L four, 3.8 L inline-six or 4.1 L inline-six. These models received several facelifts and remained in production until about 1992.

A Rekord C coupé was locally built in South Africa as a Ranger SS during the 1970s.

==Rekord D (1972–1977)==
About 1.1 million Rekord Ds were made. Because the name &quot;Rekord D&quot; was easily mistaken to connote a diesel-powered car, the name Rekord II was often used in sales literature. The first prototype was ready in 1971. The engine types available were 1897 cc or 1698 cc CIH (cam-in-head) four-cylinder gasoline engines. There was also a 2068 cc diesel version which was later accompanied by a smaller 2.0 litre version for certain markets. The diesel engine was higher than gasoline variants, so diesel model hoods have a raised midsection. The six-cylinder variant of this car is called the Commodore B. Transmissions available were standard four-speed manual with either floor or steering-column shifter and TH-180 automatic transmission. The body is of unitary construction. Body types available were two-door sedan, four-door sedan, three-door wagon, five-door wagon, two-door coupé and two-door van. There was also a variant called &quot;Berlina&quot; with more luxurious interior and wheels.

The Rangers were also transferred to this new generation, with the dropping of the 130 and 153 and the adding of a 1.7 L engine. In 1972, the line-up consisted of the base Ranger 1700, the mid-level Ranger 1900, and the top-of-the-line Ranger 2500. In 1974, a 2.8L engine was introduced to the Ranger family. However, by that time the Rangers were unpopular, and were discontinued after the 1976 model year. Most of these were sold exclusively in Continental Europe, especially the Benelux region.

South Africa used this body type for their Chevrolet 2500, 3800 and 4100 series. They looked visually almost identical but had the Chevrolet 2500 (4-cylinder) or 3800 and 4100 (6-cylinder) engines installed. They were available as four-door saloon or estate. The six-cylinder versions could be differentiated from the &quot;fours&quot; as they had four round headlights as opposed to the two rectangular units.

These cars were also assembled in Iran from 1974 till 1977 (before the revolution) under the local &quot;Chevrolet Royale / or Chevrolet Iran&quot; brand-name by Iran General Motors. The two models were 2500 and 2800 with 2.5L and 2.8L, respectively. The production of these vehicles ended in 1977 when the assembly line started producing the Chevrolet Nova, Buick Skylark, and Cadillac Seville cars until 1987. The Vauxhall FE Victor/VX4 also used the floorpan and basic body architecture of the Rekord D - but retained Vauxhall designed running gear and had no interchangeable body panels.


==Rekord E (1977–1986)==
The E model can be subdivided into Rekord E1 (1977–82) and Rekord E2 (1982–86). Over 1.4 million units were made. The Rekord E was available as a two- or four-door sedan, and as a three- or five-door Caravan (station wagon). In some markets where the tax structure was suitable, a three-door van version was also available.

A version of the Rekord E was sold by Vauxhall in the United Kingdom from 1978 as the Carlton, with a restyled &quot;droopsnoot&quot; nose. Unlike the Rekord D, there was a much stronger correlation between the Rekord and its Vauxhall sister - now essentially being the same car apart from the aforementioned styling changes. Prior to the introduction of the facelift E2 in 1982, the Opel and Vauxhall versions were sold in competition with each other in the UK market. The Rekord and Carlton&#x27;s differences in appearance vanished following the 1982 facelift, when most of the Opel range was withdrawn from sale in the UK. The E1 model was also sold in South Africa, initially as the Chevrolet Rekord, before being rebranded as an Opel in 1982, remaining in production until 1984. The E2 model remained in production in South Africa until the early 1990s, and was also available with a six-cylinder engine.

The Opel Rekord finished production in the autumn of 1986 when it was replaced by the Opel Omega, with the Vauxhall equivalent retaining the Carlton nameplate.

The Rekord E was also the basis for the first generation of the Holden Commodore, from the VB to the VL series versions. These versions of the Commodore were produced and sold in Australia and New Zealand from 1978 to 1988.

<text>Muthulakshmi was the wife of bandit Veerappan, from 1990 to his death in 2004. She lived in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India. She was born in Neruppore village, Dharmapuri District to a farming family.

==Wife of Veerappan==
She married Veerappan in 1990, and lived with him in the forests of the border areas Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. She was arrested several times on charges of aiding and abetting various crimes and murders carried out by Veerappan&#x27;s gang. The police also charged that Veerappan gave Muthulakshmi a large amount of money after he reportedly received ransom money for his role in Kannada actor Rajkumar&#x27;s kidnapping.

===Arrests===

Five charges were laid against Muthulakshmi, including killing police personnel in the Palar blast, killing elephants, and smuggling sandalwood between 1991 and 1993. She was also arrested for kidnapping Rajkumar alongside Veerappan (Rajkumar was released after 108 days). In spite of the efforts of the police, they were unable to apprehend Veerappan. Muthulakshmi was acquitted along with 10 others; however, 13 of her relatives were convicted. Muthulakshmi was acquitted of almost all charges registered against her.

==Personal life==
Muthulakshmi has two daughters, Vidyarani and Prabha Vijayalakshmi, who, as of 2011, were engineering students in Tamil Nadu.

After her acquittal announced she would be undertaking social service activities to help people and those who were affected by law enforcement agencies for helping Veerappan. She filed a case against filmmaker A.M.R. Ramesh for showing her slain husband poorly in his film, &quot;Attahasa&quot; and received compensation of ₹25 lakhs before the picture was released.

===Politics===

Muthulakshmi unsuccessfully ran for Tamil Nadu Assembly elections in 2006, and has political ambitions to make use of her late husband&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; image to help people.

In January 2018, she announced the formation of &#x27;Mann Kaakkum Veerathamizhar Peramaippu&#x27; (Federation of Brave Tamils to protect the Soil) to lobby the government for fresh water to assist farmers.

<doc id="1083266" wikidata="Q898414" url="?curid=1083266" title="Robin Fraser">
<text>Robin Fraser (born December 17, 1966) is an American soccer coach and former player. He is the head coach of Major League Soccer club Toronto FC. He previously served as head coach of Colorado Rapids and Chivas USA and as an assistant for Real Salt Lake, Toronto, and the New York Red Bulls.

A former defender, Fraser played six seasons in the American Professional Soccer League and ten in Major League Soccer. He earned 27 caps with the United States national team between 1988 and 2001.

==Youth and college==
Fraser was born in Jamaica and grew up in Miami, Florida where he played soccer at Miami Palmetto High School. He played college soccer at Florida International University from 1984 to 1988, leading the team to an NCAA Division II Championship as a freshman. After the team moved to Division I before the 1987 season, he was recognized as a 1987 and 1988 second-team All-American, and was a finalist for the Hermann Trophy as a senior.

==Playing career==
===Professional===
In 1988, Fraser signed with the Miami Sharks in the American Soccer League. He played two seasons with the Sharks. In 1990, he moved to the Colorado Foxes of the American Professional Soccer League, for whom he played from 1990 to 1995. While with the Foxes, Fraser was named an APSL All-Star four straight years, from 1992 to his final season in 1995.

When Major League Soccer was created, he was the Los Angeles Galaxy&#x27;s first selection (fourth overall) in the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Fraser played five seasons with Galaxy, and was named to the league&#x27;s Best XI four times (1996, 1998, 1999, 2000), and was named MLS Defender of the Year in 1999.

Fraser was traded to the Colorado Rapids in a salary-cap-related move before the 2001 season. He spent three years in Colorado, before being traded to the Columbus Crew for two draft picks. Fraser anchored the Crew defense in 2004, and was once again considered one of the best in MLS at the position, winning his second Defender of the Year award and being named to his fifth Best XI while captaining the Crew to the Supporters&#x27; Shield. During the 2003 and 2004 season, Fraser helped mentor two of MLS&#x27;s most promising young defenders, Nat Borchers and Chad Marshall. Never a big scorer, Fraser only scored one regular season and one playoff goal in his entire MLS career. He retired after the 2005 season.

Fraser was honored as one of The 25 Greatest players in MLS history on December 10, 2020.

===International===
Although Fraser was born in Jamaica, he chose to represent the United States at the international level, after becoming a citizen in June 1986. He made his debut against Chile on June 1, 1988, and amassed 27 caps. His last came in a scoreless tie with Ecuador on June 7, 2001.

==Coaching career==
===Early Career &amp; Chivas USA===
During the late 90s, Robin Fraser and Greg Vanney co-coached a local girls soccer club in Los Angeles California known as the Santa Anita Soccer Club or SASC.
In 2007, Real Salt Lake hired Fraser as a third assistant coach. On January 4, 2011, Fraser was hired as the new head coach of Chivas USA, becoming the team&#x27;s sixth coach in seven years.

Fraser was dismissed by Chivas after a two-year run saw him post a 15–32–21 record, including a 14-match winless streak in his second season. During the off-season, he was named as an assistant coach for the New York Red Bulls under new head coach Mike Petke.

After two season in New York, Fraser moved to Toronto FC, where served as assistant coach alongside head coach Greg Vanney. The two previously had worked together with Chivas USA, albeit in reversed roles, with Fraser the head man and Vanney working underneath him.

===Colorado Rapids===
On August 25, 2019, Fraser became the head coach for Colorado Rapids, following the dismissal of then intern head coach Conor Casey. The Rapids won their first three games under Fraser and won five of their last seven to close 2019 just shy of the playoffs. Colorado ended the season tied for the third-most goals scored in MLS with 58, the club&#x27;s highest total since scoring 62 in 1998.

The Rapids&#x27; offensive growth continued in 2020. Colorado scored 32 goals in 18 games. The Rapids&#x27; 1.78 goals per game ranked sixth in MLS. Colorado posted a positive goal differential for the first time since 2016. On Sep 12, Colorado defeated Real Salt Lake, 5–0, earning its first ever win at Rio Tinto Stadium and reclaiming the Rocky Mountain Cup. The win also marked the Rapids&#x27; largest margin of victory ever, which they would match three games later in a 5–0 win over San Jose Earthquakes. Fraser led Colorado on a three-game winning streak, the second of his Rapids tenure, to close out the regular season and clinch a berth in the Audi 2020 MLS Cup Playoffs as the fifth seed in the Western Conference. Fraser posted the best 25-game start of any Rapids head coach in history, scoring 47 goals, winning 13 games and earning 43 points, which are the most by a Rapids head coach since the introduction of draws to MLS In 2000.

On March 23, 2022, the Rapids announced that Fraser had signed a new contract with the team, extending his tenure through the 2025 season. Fraser and the Rapids parted ways on September 5, 2023, as the Rapids were in last place in the Western Conference at that point in time.

===Toronto FC===
On January 10, 2025, Fraser was announced as the head coach of Toronto FC on a three-year contract.

<text>Slagelse () is a town on Zealand, Denmark. The town is the seat of Slagelse Municipality, and is the biggest town of the municipality. It is located 15 km east of Korsør, 16 km north-east of Skælskør, 33 km south-east of Kalundborg and 14 km west of Sorø.

==History==

Slagelse has been inhabited since at least the Viking Age, where it was a Pagan site. Trelleborg, a ring castle, was built near the current location of Slagelse in 980, which made the location strategically important. A church was built at Slagelse&#x27;s current location in the 1000s. Around this time, coins were minted in Slagelse.

Antvorskov was built in the 1100s by Valdemar I, who had recently acquired Zealand. He built the monastery in an attempt to gain control and favor with the locals. The monastery was used by the Knights Hospitaller. 

Slagelse was granted the status of a market town in 1288 by Eric V. This gave the town a series of privileges, though eventually put it in competition with the neighboring market towns of Korsør and Skælskør. In the 1780s a road from Copenhagen to Korsør was built, and this road ran through Slagelse.

<text>Patrick Augustine Feehan (August 28, 1829 – July 12, 1902), was an Irish-born American Catholic prelate who served as the first Archbishop of Chicago from 1880 until his death in 1902. He previously served as Bishop of Nashville from 1865 to 1880.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Patrick Feehan was born on August 28, 1829, in Killenaule, County Tipperary, in Ireland, to Patrick and Judith (Cooney) Feehan. His father was a gentleman farmer. At age ten, Feehan was sent to live with his paternal grandfather to attend school in Fethard. He returned to Killenaule two years later when a school opened there. Feehan learned to speak French fluently and was a dedicated reader.At age 14 he started studying Gaelic. 

In 1845, at age 16, Feehan entered Castleknock College in Dublin as an ecclesiastic student, where he befriended the future Irish statesman Charles Russell. By that point, Feehan know that he wanted to become a priest 

In January 1847, Feehan started his studies for the priesthood at St Patrick&#x27;s College in Maynooth, the major seminary in Ireland. In 1850, his family emigrated to the United States, sailing from Dublin.

Archbishop Peter Kenrick of the Archdiocese of St. Louis in the United States had opened the Carondelet Seminary, a major seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. While in Ireland, he recruited Feehan to come to his archdiocese. Although Feehan was on track to become a professor at St. Patrick, the college agreed to his leaving. In 1852, Feehan left for the United States.

=== Priesthood ===
Feehan was ordained a priest in St. Louis for the Archdiocese of St. Louis by Kendrick on November 1, 1852. After his ordination, Kendrick assigned Feehan to teach at the diocesan seminary. In July 1853, he was assigned to St. John&#x27;s Parish in St. Louis.

During a cholera epidemic in St. Louis that year, Feehan spent many hours tending the sick and blessing the dead. He volunteered to place the dead in coffins. On another occasion, Feehan encountered a young girl with smallpox who had been abandoned by her relatives. He found a woman who already had that disease to foster the child.

In 1854, Feehan was appointed president of Carondelet Seminary. He was also assigned to served as chaplain to the Sisters of St. Joseph at their convent on the seminary property. In 1858, Feehan was appointed pastor of St. Michael&#x27;s Parish in St. Louis. In 1859, he became pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in St. Louis. He established a chapter of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul to aid the poor. He would personally visit all the poor and the sick in the parish. While visiting the jail, he encountered a man who had broken into the Immaculate Conception rectory and stole a watch and money from Feehan. The inmate expressed his remorse and said that he want to move west to find a job. Feehan gave him $50. Two years later, the man sent Feehan a check for $75 and his thanks.

During the American Civil War, the Sisters of Charity were put in charge of a military hospital in St. Louis, where Feehan spent long hours comforting the sick and wounded. After the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee on April 6 to 7, 1862, boatloads of wounded Union Army soldiers arrived in St. Louis. For three straight days, Feehan moved along the wharf and the stretchers laid in rows on the street, administering last rites to dying soldiers. Some of them were Protestants who requested baptism before they died.

===Bishop of Nashville===
Feehan was appointed bishop of Nashville by Pope Pius IX on June 7, 1865. Feehan at first declined, wanting to be able to tend to his elderly mother, but accepted the appointment after she died. He was consecrated bishop at the Cathedral of Saint Louis in St. Louis, Missouri, by Kendrick on November 12, 1865.At that time, the diocese included the entire State of Tennessee. The American Civil War had ending only a couple of weeks earlier and the state was still under military occupation. The cathedral and the bishop&#x27;s residence were in bad shape, having been used for billeting soldiers during the war. The diocese had only three priests.

Feehan rehabilitated St. Cecilia&#x27;s Convent, the home of the Dominican Sisters in Nashville. In 1866, he brought the Sisters of Charity to the city, where they opened St. Bernard&#x27;s Academy for girls in the mansion of the former governor. During the summer and fall of 1866, he worked to relieve the suffering of victims of a cholera outbreak in Nashville. 

In October 1866, Feehan traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, to participate in the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, a meeting of bishops in the American church to discuss rules and policies. The diocese was hard hit by bank closures and the depression of 1873. During a sermon in 1877, Feehan warned Catholic men against joined secular fraternal orders. His speech encouraged a group of Catholic men to create the Catholic Knights of America, which would eventually provide affordable life insurance to poor working men across the country. In 1877 and 1878, the diocese suffered yellow fever outbreaks, resulting in the deaths of 13 religious sisters and nine priests, including the vicar general.

===Archbishop of Chicago===
On September 10, 1880, Feehan was appointed as the first archbishop of the new Archdiocese of Chicago by Pope Leo XIII.He was greeted by several thousand people when he arrived in the city in November 1880.

From 1880 to 1902, the Catholic population of Chicago nearly quadrupled, to 800,000, largely due to the arrival of immigrants. In adding to the Irish and German communities already established, Polish, Bohemian, French, Lithuanian, Italian, Croatian, Slovak and Dutch Catholics brought their own languages and cultural traditions. Feehan preferred to keep a low profile; relatively few speeches and sermons exist from his 22-year tenure.

Chicago was still feeling the effects of the Great Fire of 1871, which destroyed many of the schools and churches. Feehan accommodated these diverse needs by creating national parishes to serve ethnic communities and recruited religious orders from their home countries to staff them. Of the 140 parishes he founded, 52 percent were national parishes. According to Reverend Martin Zielinski, an associate professor of Catholic history at Mundelein Seminary, the parishes provided a place where immigrants could find familiar fraternal organizations, music, and language. They served as a haven from xenophobia and hostility directed toward immigrants and Catholics.

Epidemics of cholera and yellow fever in Chicago left dozens of orphans. In 1881, Feehan established the St. Vincent Orphan Asylum, and in 1883 St. Mary&#x27;s Training School for Boys, a trade school for homeless boys, now known as Maryville Academy. This was followed in 1887 with St. Paul&#x27;s Home for Working Boys, now known as Mercy Home. 

Feehan was a strong supporter of Catholic education, and promoted it at the exhibition at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago &quot;Archbishop Feehan believed a strong system of Catholic education would solve the problem of inconsistent religious instruction at home, and unify a rapidly diversifying Catholic America.&quot; He also brought the Vincentians to Chicago in 1898 to start St. Vincent&#x27;s College, which is today DePaul University.

=== Death and legacy ===
Patrick Feehan died on July 12, 1902, in Chicago. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised his &quot;diplomatic handling&quot; of all the ethnic groups in the diocese.

<text>David Winner (born 5 December 1956) is an English writer and journalist. He lives in Kilburn, London.

His best-known books are &quot;Those Feet: An Intimate History of English Football&quot; (2005), and &quot;Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football&quot; (2000).

&quot;Brilliant Orange&quot; was shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 2000. The book explains why the football players of the Netherlands play beautifully but lose their most important matches. Winner connects football to other elements of Dutch life and culture, such as their flat flooding-prone land, unusual taste in art, and their experiences in World War 2.

&quot;Around the World in 90 Minutes (plus extra time and penalties)&quot; (2007) was based on his journey to 13 countries during the four weeks of the 2006 World Cup.

His quirky travel book &quot;Al Dente: Madness, Beauty &amp; the Food of Rome&quot; (2012) was described by Pen Vogler in The Observer, [Sunday 11 March 2012] as being &quot;like a fusion of Coleridge&#x27;s Table Talk and Marinetti&#x27;s The Futurist Cookbook, peopled with eccentric film-makers, anorexic saints and wafer-making nuns&quot;.

He recently wrote a biography of footballer Dennis Bergkamp, co-written with Jaap Visser, and based on interviews with Bergkamp. The English edition, &quot;Dennis Bergkamp, Stillness and Speed&quot;, was long-listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2013. The Dutch edition, published by Uitgeverij Carrera, is entitled &quot;Dennis Bergkamp: de biografie&quot;. 
He most recently was the ghostwriter of Rio Ferdinand&#x27;s 2014 autobiography #2Sides.

Winner also co-wrote &quot;The Coming of The Greens&quot; (1988) (with Jonathon Porritt), a study of environmentalism in the United Kingdom and biographies for children of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Raoul Wallenberg, Peter Benenson (founder of Amnesty International) and Eleanor Roosevelt.

He also translated a book about Johan Cruyff, The Netherlands best-ever footballer titled &quot;Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff, The ABC of an Obstinate Maestro&quot; by Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp.

Winner supports Arsenal football club.

<text>The HP-HIL (&quot;Hewlett-Packard Human Interface Link&quot;) is the name of a computer bus used by Hewlett-Packard to connect keyboards, mice, trackballs, digitizers, tablets, barcode readers, rotary knobs, touchscreens, and other human interface peripherals to their HP 9000 workstations. The bus was in use until the mid-1990s, when HP substituted PS/2 technology for HIL. The PS/2 peripherals were themselves replaced with USB-connected models.

The HIL bus is a daisy-chain of up to 7 devices, running at a raw clock speed of 8 MHz. Each HIL device typically has an output connector, and an input connector to which the next device in the chain plugs; the exception is the mouse which has only the output connector.

HIL buses can be found on HP PA-RISC and m68k based machines, some early HP Vectra computers, as well as in some HP/Agilent Logic Analyzers. HP-UX, OpenBSD, Linux and NetBSD include drivers for the HIL bus and HIL devices.

The HP-HIL bus uses specific 4-pin, 6-pin, or 8-pin SDL connectors, somewhat similar to the 8P8C 8-pin modular connector commonly (though incorrectly) called the RJ-45. The bus can reportedly also use a 9-pin D-subminiature DE-9 connector. 

A HIL to PS/2 converter is available, namely the HP A4220-62001.

<doc id="1083284" wikidata="Q1357140" url="?curid=1083284" title="Warmen">
<text>Warmen is a Finnish heavy metal band assembled by keyboardist Janne &quot;Warman&quot; Wirman. Wirman has played with Children of Bodom from 1997 until their disbandment in 2019, and in 2000 created a musical project focused on instrumental work, which would only have guest singers on a few selected songs.

==Albums==

===&quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; (1999–2001)===
The first incarnation of Warmen was composed of Janne, guitarist Sami Virtanen and drummer Mirka Rantanen. This line-up recorded and released the &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; album in 2000, with the collaboration of guest singer Kimberly Goss (from Sinergy), guitarist Roope Latvala (also from Sinergy, later also from Children of Bodom) and bassist Jari Kainulainen (from Stratovarius).

===&quot;Beyond Abilities&quot; (2002–2004)===
The following year, the band saw the addition of Lauri Porra (later in Sinergy and Stratovarius) and Janne&#x27;s guitarist brother, Antti Wirman (from Kotipelto). In the &quot;Warmen Productions Studio&quot; (now called &quot;Beyond Abilities&quot;), this line-up recorded the album &quot;Beyond Abilities&quot;, a progressive metal album that received critical appraisal. With a more diverse use of vocals, this album made use of the talent of Timo Kotipelto (from Stratovarius), Pasi Nykänen (from Throne of Chaos) and returning vocalist Kimberly Goss.

===&quot;Accept the Fact&quot; (2005–2006)===
Their third album, &quot;Accept the Fact&quot; was released in June 2005 and features vocals by Timo Kotipelto, Marko Vaara, Jonna Kosonen and Alexi Laiho from Children of Bodom. Alexi performs clean vocals in &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching Me&quot; (originally by Rockwell), which is rare, since in Children of Bodom he has performed clean vocals in only one song, a cover of &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, originally by Billy Idol. The spoken words on the first track &quot;Accept the Fact&quot; are taken from the movie &quot;Amadeus&quot;, spoken by the character Antonio Salieri.

===&quot;Japanese Hospitality&quot; (2008–2010)===

The fourth Warmen album, titled &quot;Japanese Hospitality&quot;, was released on August 24, 2009 via Spinefarm Records.

<text>Langley is a village and civil parish in the Maidstone District of Kent, England. The parish is located on the A274 road leading south from Maidstone to Headcorn .

==History==

Langley is a common English place-name, from the Old English &quot;lang leah&quot; or ‘long field or woodland’. This village first appears in the records in 814 as Longanleag.

The village church is dedicated to St Mary. Behind this church is a lake, which is possible place for the medieval judicial practice of trial by cold water. When a jury couldn&#x27;t decide on a person&#x27;s innocence, it was left to God to decide. If the accused floated they were guilty because the water rejected them. If they sank, the water accepted them and thus were innocent. As is often thought it is not if they drowned, but the result was drowning in some cases. It had to be close to the church because the water would be holy.

Maidstone Museum &amp; Art Gallery exhibits articles excavated from a site in Langley believed to have been a walled Roman cemetery.

==Geography==
The village is three miles (5km) from the county town.

==Culture and Community==
The village has two public houses, The Potting Shed, and The Plough.

Its post office has been closed for over 10 years.

There is also &#x27;Langley Heath&#x27; and by it is a wood called Abbey Wood.

There is a village hall, on it is a playing field with room for 2 football pitches, and a small play area, and a basketball net.

<doc id="1083290" wikidata="Q2393619" url="?curid=1083290" title="Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)">
<text>Jame Gumb (known by the nickname &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;) is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Thomas Harris&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and its 1991 film adaptation, in which he is played by Ted Levine. In the film and the novel, he is a serial killer who murders overweight women and skins them so he can make a &quot;woman suit&quot; for himself. In the television series &quot;Clarice&quot;, he is portrayed by Simon Northwood.

==Overview==
===Background===
Jame Gumb was born in California in 1948 or 1949. It is stated that the unusual spelling of his name is due to a clerical error on his birth certificate &quot;that no one bothered to correct&quot;. Gumb&#x27;s mother, an aspiring actress, went into an alcoholic decline after her career failed to materialize, and Gumb was placed in a foster home when he was two. The novel goes on to tell of Gumb living in foster homes until age 10, when he is adopted by his grandparents, who become his first victims when he impulsively kills them two years later. Gumb is institutionalized in Tulare Vocational Rehabilitation, a psychiatric hospital, where he learns to be a tailor. Later, Gumb has a relationship with Benjamin Raspail. After Raspail leaves him, Gumb kills Raspail&#x27;s new lover, Klaus, and flays him.

The screenplay omits Gumb&#x27;s backstory but does imply that he had a traumatic childhood. In the film, Hannibal Lecter summarizes Gumb&#x27;s life thus: &quot;Our Billy wasn&#x27;t born a criminal, Clarice. He was made one through years of systematic abuse.&quot;

Both the novel and film depict Gumb as hating his own identity, though multiple characters state that Gumb is not transsexual. In the novel, multiple examples of how Gumb does not fit the psychological profile of a real transsexual are given. Gumb wants to become a woman—or at least believes he does—but repeatedly fails to qualify for gender reassignment surgery. He kills women so he can skin them and create a &quot;woman suit&quot; for himself, completing his &quot;transformation&quot;. He thinks of his victims as &quot;things&quot; rather than people, often calling them &quot;it&quot;—hence one of his most famous lines from the film, &quot;It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.&quot; The only living thing he feels real affection for is his dog, Precious.

===&quot;Modus operandi&quot;===
Gumb&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; is to approach a woman while pretending to be injured, ask for help, then knock her out in a surprise attack and kidnap her. He takes her to his house and leaves her in a well in his basement, where he starves her until her skin is loose enough to easily remove. In the first two cases, he leads the victims upstairs, slips nooses around their necks and pushes them from the stairs, strangling them. He then skins parts of their body (a different section on each victim), and then dumps each body into a different river, destroying any trace of evidence.

This MO caused the homicide squad to nickname him Buffalo Bill (Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show typically claimed that Buffalo Bill Cody had scalped a Cheyenne warrior). One officer quipped it was because he &quot;skins his humps&quot;. He also inserts a Death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth into the victim&#x27;s throat because he is fascinated by the insect&#x27;s metamorphosis, a process that he wants to undergo by becoming a woman. In the case of Gumb&#x27;s first victim, Fredrica Bimmel, he weighs down her body, so she ends up being the third victim found. In the case of the fourth victim, he shoots rather than strangles her.

At the start of the novel, Gumb has already murdered five women. Behavioral Science Unit Chief Jack Crawford assigns gifted trainee Clarice Starling to question incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter about the case. (Lecter had met Gumb while treating Raspail.) When Gumb kidnaps Catherine Martin, the daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin, Lecter offers to give Starling a psychological profile of the killer in return for a transfer to a federal institution; this profile is mostly made up of cryptic clues designed to help Starling figure it out for herself. Starling eventually deduces from Lecter&#x27;s riddles that Gumb knew his first victim, Frederica Bimmel, and goes to Bimmel&#x27;s hometown of Belvedere, Ohio to gather information. By this time, Crawford has already found out the killer&#x27;s true identity and gone with a SWAT team to his house to arrest him, but they find that it is only a business address. Meanwhile, Starling goes to the home of Bimmel&#x27;s employer, Mrs. Lippman, only to find Gumb calling himself &quot;Jack Gordon&quot; living there. (Gumb had murdered Mrs. Lippman earlier.)

When Starling sees a moth flutter by, she realizes she has found the killer and orders him to surrender. Gumb flees into the basement and stalks her with a revolver and night vision goggles. Just as he is about to shoot Starling, she hears him behind her, turns around and opens fire, killing him. In the novel, he addresses his final words to her, asking her, &quot;How does it feel to be so beautiful?&quot; before choking to death on his own blood.

==Influences==
Harris based various elements of Gumb&#x27;s MO on three real-life serial killers:

* Ed Gein, who fashioned trophies and keepsakes from the bones and skin of corpses he dug up at cemeteries, as well as from two women that he murdered. He also made a female &quot;skin suit&quot; and skin masks.
* Ted Bundy, who pretended to be injured (using an arm-brace or crutches) as a ploy to ask his victims for help. When they helped him, he incapacitated and killed them.
* Gary M. Heidnik, who kidnapped, raped and tortured six women while holding them prisoner in a pit, where two died.

==Analysis==
The film adaptation of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was criticized by some LGBT journalists for its portrayal of Gumb.

Marjorie Garber, author of &quot;Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety&quot;, asserts that despite the book and the film indicating that Buffalo Bill merely believes himself to be transsexual, they still imply negative connotations about transsexual identity. Garber says, &quot;Harris&#x27;s book manifests its cultural anxiety through a kind of baroque bravado of plot,&quot; and calls the book &quot;a fable of gender dysphoria gone spectacularly awry&quot;.

Barbara Creed, writing in &quot;Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema&quot;, says that Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman &quot;presumably because he sees femininity as a more desirable state, possibly a superior one&quot;. For Buffalo Bill, the woman is &quot;[a] totem animal&quot;. Not only does he want to wear women&#x27;s skin, he wants to become a woman; he dresses in women&#x27;s clothes and tucks his penis behind his legs to appear female. Creed writes, &quot;To experience a rebirth as woman, Buffalo Bill must wear the skin of woman not just to experience a physical transformation but also to acquire the &quot;power of transformation&quot; associated with woman&#x27;s ability to give birth.&quot; Buffalo Bill wears the skin of his totem animal to assume its power.

Jack Halberstam, author of &quot;Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters&quot;, writes, &quot;The cause for Buffalo Bill&#x27;s extreme violence against women lies not in his gender confusion or his sexual orientation but in his humanist presumption that his sex and his gender and his orientation must all match up to a mythic norm of white heterosexual masculinity.&quot; Halberstam says Buffalo Bill symbolizes a lack of ease with one&#x27;s skin. He writes that the character is also a combination of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in how he is the creator gathering body parts and experimenting with his own body. Halberstam writes, &quot;He does not understand gender as inherent, innate; he reads it only as a surface effect, a representation, an external attribute engineered into identity.&quot; Buffalo Bill challenges &quot;the interiority of gender&quot; by taking skin and remaking it into a costume.

Filmmaker Lilly Wachowski, upon coming out as transgender to the &quot;Windy City Times&quot; in March 2016, singled out &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; for &quot;demonizing and vilifying&quot; the transgender community in media through Buffalo Bill, alleging that Bill has served as a reference for anti-transgender attack ads portraying trans people as potential predators that target women&#x27;s bathrooms. &quot;We are not predators, we are prey,&quot; Wachowski said.

Bill&#x27;s character and the claims that Bill is &quot;not really transsexual&quot; have been criticized as transphobic. While being &quot;one of the most significant and impactful examples of pop culture transmisogyny&quot; it allegedly &quot;encourages disbelief of trans people&#x27;s self-identification&quot;.

<text>Monippally is a small village in Kottayam district, Kerala, South India. Formerly known as &#x27;Mohanappally&#x27; (Beautiful Place) or &#x27;Munippally&#x27; (Temple of &quot;Muni&quot;s, Sage or Saints). In her yesteryears, Monippally was a famous ginger cultivation area in Central Travancore. Dry Ginger, Turmeric and Kacholam were the main attractions of trade.

==Location==
Monippally town is located in between Kuravilangad and Koothattukulam on the M C Road (SH1). This village is part of Uzhavoor Grama Panchayat in Meenachil (Pala) Taluk. Uzhavoor, Veliyannoor, Koothattukulam, Vazhithala, Achickal, Elanji, Njeezhoor and Kuravilangad are the neighboring areas. The nearest city is Pala.

==Economy==
Monippally&#x27;s non-resident population has always had a significant impact on its economy. But agriculture is the soul of Monippallians, and is critically important to its economy. Villagers are engaged in crop plantations of rubber, cocoa, vanilla, black pepper, ginger and turmeric. Due to a large amount of emigration, and thus a large amount of foreign cash flowing into the village, the village has a very high social life index - very high literacy rates and high occurrence of &quot;creature comforts&quot;.

==Education==
There&#x27;s a strong emphasis on education and healthcare - there are seven schools and three hospitals within a 4 km² area. As well as five catholic churches and one Hindu temple.
The area was rich in ginger cultivation. The first ginger Co-operative Society (Monippally Marketing Co-operative Society) was founded here. 

The late senior congress leaders M. A. John and Adv K. Joseph Monippally (Farmers Leader, Veteran Co-operator) were from this village
