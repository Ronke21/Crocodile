Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Chenoweth &quot;uses [her character&#x27;s] histrionics to create one of the most virtuosic portraits in song ever on Broadway. The vocal vocabulary she deploys here ranges from jazz-baby brass to operatic silver, often in a single number, and she switches among them with jaw-dropping ease. And every perfectly weighted note is set off by an impeccably exaggerated gesture.&quot; She was nominated for a Tony Award and won another Drama Desk Award for her performance. In November 2023, Chenoweth made a cameo appearance in &quot;Gutenberg! The Musical!&quot; as The Producer She co-produced and stars as the title character, Jackie Siegel, in the musical &quot;The Queen of Versailles&quot;, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, which premiered at Colonial Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, in July 2024.

In 2010, Chenoweth returned to &quot;Glee&quot; as April Rhodes, singing more songs. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review commented, &quot;the best part about &#x27;Home&#x27; was undoubtedly the return of Kristin Chenoweth as April. From her spunky duet of Fire with Schue, to the heart-achingly lonely coo of &#x27;One Less Bell to Answer&#x27; which segued into a fantastic reprise of &#x27;A House Is Not a Home&#x27; and of course her bone-chilling take on Home I fell in love with her again.&quot; She was nominated for both 2010 and 2011 Emmy Awards for her performances on &quot;Glee&quot;.

In support of the album, she presented a concert series titled &quot;Kristin Chenoweth: For the Girls&quot; at the Nederlander Theatre from November 8 to 17, 2019.

==Special events and appearances==
Chenoweth and the cast of the Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot; performed the song &quot;One Short Day&quot; in the 2003 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. In the 2005 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Chenoweth performed the song &quot;Oklahoma&quot; while riding aboard the &quot;Oklahoma Rising&quot; float. The float was making the first of three annual appearances commemorating the state of Oklahoma&#x27;s statehood centennial in 2007. She was the star performer of the opening ceremony of the 2007 Tournament of Roses Parade. She sang &quot;Our Good Nature&quot;, an original composition written to coincide with the Oklahoma centennial celebration and the theme of the parade. In the 2008 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, she performed the song &quot;The Christmas Waltz&quot; from her &quot;A Lovely Way to Spend Christmas&quot; album while riding aboard the &quot;Care Bears Winter Fun-Derland&quot; float.

She sang with Il Divo as part of Il Divo&#x27;s Christmas Tour on , 16 and 17, 2009, in New York City and in Boston. She has sung the U.S. national anthem at various sporting events, including the 2010 New York Yankees home opener, at Candlestick Park for the NFL&#x27;s NFC Conference Championship on January 22, 2012, at the Arizona Cardinals&#x27; season opener in 2016 and their game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the Seattle Seahawks on November 9, 2017. Also in 2010, Chenoweth hosted the 15th Annual Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards on VH1.

In 2013, Chenoweth co-hosted the Oscars Red Carpet Live immediately prior to the 85th Academy Awards and also sang the closing number of the ceremony, &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Losers&quot;, with host Seth MacFarlane, in which, paraphrasing the original Frank Sinatra song, the two poked genial fun at nominees who had not received awards. Chenoweth was the solo performer in the Live from Lincoln Center feature &quot;The Dames of Broadway... All of &#x27;Em!!!&quot; In July, she hosted the fifth Just For Laughs gala in Montreal. She also appeared in the 2013 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade performing the song &quot;New York, New York&quot; while riding aboard Royal Caribbean&#x27;s &quot;A World at Sea&quot; float.

In 2015, she co-hosted the Tony Awards. She appeared as a guest with Andrea Bocelli on some of his 2017–2018 American tour stops. In December 2018, Chenoweth performed with and narrated the Tabernacle Choir&#x27;s yearly Christmas concert series in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Personal life==

In 2009, Chenoweth published a memoir, &quot;A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages&quot;, describing her life and career, including her adoption, her turn in &quot;Wicked&quot; and her time in Hollywood. Chenoweth suffers from Ménière&#x27;s disease, an inner-ear disorder that can cause vertigo, headaches and nausea, among other symptoms. She has said that during some performances, she leaned on her co-stars to keep her balance, and that it has caused her to miss performances.

Chenoweth has spoken publicly about her religious faith; she describes herself as a &quot;non-judgmental, liberal Christian&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when Chenoweth &quot;assured her theater fans that she supports gay rights, her Christian base was outraged; she was disinvited from performing at a Women of Faith conference in &quot;. Chenoweth released an album in , &quot;As I Am&quot;, a mixture of hymns and contemporary Christian music, with adult contemporary arrangements. To promote the album, she made an appearance on &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, which upset some of her gay fans. She later said she thought that the &quot;Pat Robertsons and Jerry Falwells of the world are scary&quot; and that she regretted appearing on the show.

In May 2010, Chenoweth wrote in response to an article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; by Ramin Setoodeh, an openly gay writer. Setoodeh thought that her Tony-nominated &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; co-star, Sean Hayes, &quot;comes off as wooden and insincere&quot; in playing the straight character Chuck and that Jonathan Groff has a similar credibility problem in the TV show &quot;Glee&quot;. He questioned whether any openly gay actor could acceptably portray a straight character. Chenoweth called the article &quot;horrendously homophobic&quot; and criticized Setoodeh&#x27;s view as rationalizing &quot;the same kind of bullying&quot; that gay youths face in high school. Chenoweth argued that audiences &quot;come to the theater to go on a journey&quot; and do not care about an actor&#x27;s sexual orientation. The story was discussed in media including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Chenoweth has dated several men in Hollywood, including producer Dana Brunetti, actors Seth Green, Lane Garrison and Marc Kudisch (to whom she was engaged from 1998 to 2001), and producer/writer Aaron Sorkin. In Sorkin&#x27;s &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, the character of the Christian Harriet Hayes bears significant resemblances to Chenoweth, and the relationship between Hayes and &quot;East coast liberal Jewish atheist&quot; (Hayes&#x27; description) Matt Albie is modeled after that of Chenoweth and Sorkin. For example, Chenoweth&#x27;s decision to appear on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and her falling out with Women of Faith were depicted with the Hayes character. In 2018, Chenoweth began dating Josh Bryant, the guitarist for country band Backroad Anthem. They became engaged in 2021 and were married on September 2, 2023.

In 2010, Chenoweth was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. In 2011, she won the GLAAD Vanguard Award.

In 2012, the Broken Arrow Performing Arts Center named its theatre the Kristin Chenoweth Theatre. Chenoweth received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015.

<text>Mischief Night is an informal holiday on which children, teenagers and adults engage in jokes, pranks, vandalism, or parties. It is known by a variety of names including Devil&#x27;s Night (particularly in Detroit), Gate Night, Goosey Night, Moving Night, Cabbage Night, Mystery Night and Mat Night.

==Historical background==
The earliest use of the phrase &#x27;mischief night&#x27; comes from 1790, when a headmaster encouraged a school play which ended in &quot;an Ode to Fun which praises children&#x27;s tricks on Mischief Night in most approving terms&quot;. The concept of Mischief Night is certainly older though, as Puritan Philip Stubbs decries the May Day Eve mischief night as early as 1583.

In some regions in England, these pranks originated as part of &#x27;Bringing in the May&#x27; on May Day Eve, but gradually shifted to later in the year. Dates vary in different areas, with some marking it traditionally on 4 November (the night before Bonfire Night), or the 30th October (the night before Halloween), though the latter is more common nowadays.

According to one historian, &quot;May Day and the Green Man had little resonance for children in grimy cities. They looked at the opposite end of the year and found the ideal time, the night before the Gunpowder Plot.&quot; However, the shift only happened in the late 19th century and is described by the Opies as &quot;one of the mysteries of the folklore calendar&quot;.

Word of Mischief Night began to appear in U.S. newspapers in the 1930s and 1940s and told of those who were celebrating wanting to put distance between the wholesome night of trick or treating and the chaotic night of causing havoc around the town. Some believed that the stress of the Great Depression was causing people to act out and this is what caused Mischief Night to break out at that time.

==Naming variations==
===Canada===
West Kootenay (British Columbia), Vancouver Island, Thunder Bay (Ontario), and Winnipeg also called it &quot;Gate Night&quot;; in English-speaking Quebec it is known as &quot;Mat Night&quot; where a tradition of stealing front door mats developed while &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot; is a common name in many places throughout Canada.

In rural Niagara Falls, Ontario, during the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Cabbage Night&quot; () referred to the custom of raiding local gardens for leftover rotting cabbages and hurling them about to cause mischief in the neighbourhood. The night is still celebrated in Ontario. 

===United Kingdom===
Some parts of the country hold a Mischief Night on 30 October, the night before Halloween. The separation of Halloween tricks from treats seems to have only developed in certain areas, often appearing in one region but not at all nearby regions. It is known in Welsh as &quot;Noson Ddrygioni&quot; and in Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Oidhche nan Cleas&quot;.

Mischief Nights are sometimes also held on May Day Eve, as part of &#x27;Bringing in the May.&#x27; It was historically common for that night to involve playing pranks on neighbors, gathering flowers and greenery for May morning, making loud noise with gunfire or horns, and having sex.

====Northern England====
It is celebrated across Northern England on 4 November, the night before Bonfire Night.

In parts of Yorkshire as &quot;Mischievous Night&quot; or the shortened &quot;&#x27;Chievous Night&quot; &quot;Miggy Night&quot;, &quot;Tick-Tack Night&quot;, &quot;Corn Night&quot;, &quot;Trick Night&quot; or &quot;Micky Night&quot; In some areas of Yorkshire, it is extremely popular among 13-year-olds, as they believe it to be a sort of &quot;coming of age ceremony&quot;.

In and around the city of Liverpool, Mischief Night is known locally as &quot;Mizzy Night&quot;; trouble areas were being patrolled by the Merseyside Police in 2015.

===United States===
In most of New Jersey, and other regions of the United States, including New Orleans, Philadelphia, the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, parts of New York state, and Connecticut, it is referred to as &quot;Mischief Night&quot;.

In the Great Lakes region, Michigan, western New York, and western Pennsylvania it is known as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;.

In Des Moines, Iowa and its surrounding suburbs, it is known as “Beggar’s Night”. It is common for children to trick-or-treat on Beggar&#x27;s Night rather than Halloween.

In some towns in North Jersey and parts of New York State, it is also known as &quot;Goosey Night&quot;. &quot;Cabbage Night&quot; is also used in this area as it is the term used in Vermont, Connecticut, Bergen County (New Jersey), Upstate New York, Northern Kentucky, Newport (Rhode Island) and Western Massachusetts.

Baltimore (Maryland) traditionally refers the night as &quot;Moving Night&quot; due to the custom of exchanging or stealing porch furniture and other outside items.

It is known as &quot;Gate Night&quot; in Bay City (Michigan), Rockland County (New York), North Dakota and South Dakota.

In Detroit, which was particularly affected by Devil&#x27;s Night arson and vandalism throughout the 1980s, many citizens took it upon themselves to patrol the streets to deter arson and other crimes. Started in 1997 as an initiative to combat the legacy of Devil&#x27;s Night, &quot;Angels&#x27; Night&quot; usually ran October 29 through October 31 with up to 40,000 volunteers on patrol, around the time most Halloween festivities were taking place. However, official city support for Angels&#x27; Night patrolling was discontinued in 2018 after arson had declined significantly.

====Detroit====
Devil&#x27;s Night, especially from the late 1960s to the 1990s, involved widespread serious vandalism and arson in the Detroit area. Devil&#x27;s Night made its way to Detroit in the 1930s and 1940s. Traditionally, city youths engaged in a night of mischievous or petty criminal behavior, usually consisting of minor pranks or acts of mild vandalism (such as egging, soaping or waxing windows and doors, leaving rotten vegetables or flaming bags of canine feces on stoops, or toilet papering trees and shrubs) which caused little or no property damage. By the 1970s, the concept of Devil&#x27;s Night as a phenomenon of a night of mischief and vandalism had spread, in a limited way, to cities around the state of Michigan, around the Midwest, and a few other cities around the country.

However, in Detroit in the early 1970s, the vandalism escalated to more destructive acts such as arson. This primarily took place in the inner city, but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well.

The crimes became more destructive in Detroit&#x27;s inner-city neighborhoods, and included hundreds of acts of arson and vandalism every year. The destruction was worst in the mid- to late-1980s, with more than 800 fires set in 1984, and a number in the hundreds for each subsequent year until 2011. The damage was exacerbated by the severe population decline and widespread abandonment of buildings that occurred in Detroit during the 1970s and 1980s.

Devil&#x27;s Night arson in Detroit had not declined by the early 1990s. After a brutal Devil&#x27;s Night in 1994, mayor Dennis Archer promised city residents arson would not be tolerated. In 1995, Detroit city officials organized and established Angels&#x27; Night on and around October 29–31. Each year as many as 50,000 volunteers gather to patrol neighborhoods in the city. Many volunteers kept a high profile, patrolling neighborhoods with magnetic-mount flashing amber beacons on their personal vehicles, along with communicating with command centers via CB radios or by cellular phones to report any suspicious activity. Incidences of arson and other crimes declined, a success largely attributed to the Angels&#x27; Night volunteers. The drop in reported fires for the year 2008 was credited to the Angels&#x27; Night program. That same year, 35,000 signed up to volunteer in the city, according to Daniel Cherrin, spokesperson for Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel Jr.

As a result of the efforts, the number of fires decreased to near-ordinary levels in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2010, the number of reported fires increased to 169, a 42 percent increase compared to the previous year. However, subsequent years saw the totals again decline to the low 90s for the three-day period. This average of about 32 fires per day is somewhat higher than the expected 26 fires per day through the year. 2015 saw 52 fires recorded and only 24 considered possibly arson. 2017 saw the lowest recorded number of fires with only 21 fires recorded.

==Modern practice in the United States==
Mischief Night is generally recognized as a New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland and Delaware, phenomenon.

Mischief Night tends to include popular tricks such as toilet papering yards and buildings, powder-bombing and egging cars, people, and homes, using soap to write on windows, &#x27;forking&#x27; yards, setting off fireworks and smashing pumpkins and jack-o&#x27;-lanterns. Local grocery stores often refuse to sell eggs to children and teenagers around the time of Halloween for this reason. Occasionally the damage can escalate to include the spray-painting of buildings and homes. Less destructive is the prank known as &quot;Ding-dong ditch&quot;.

In New Orleans, from 2014 to 2018, Mischief Night involved a series of unruly parade-like riots. According to participants, the Mischief Night &#x27;krewes&#x27; follow in New Orleans&#x27; carnival&#x27;s centuries-old tradition of &#x27;walking parades&#x27;, most of which take place in the lead-up to Mardi Gras. Mixing revelry with mindless violence, Mischief Night parades involve thematic floats and costumes as well as targeted vandalism and fires. Targets of vandalism, attacks and arson have included the police, bystanders and property.

When asked in an interview from 2017 how Mischief Night in New Orleans fits into the context of carnival, a parader replied &quot;Our Carnival traditions are those that actually want to &#x27;turn the world upside down&#x27;.&quot; After a parade through downtown in 2016 that saw bonfires in the street, police cars hit with paint and the Battle of Liberty Place Monument chipped away at with a sledgehammer, another participant wrote:
 
In some areas of Queens, New York, Cabbage Night has included throwing rotten fruit at neighbors, cars and buses. Children and teenagers fill eggs with Neet and Nair hair remover and throw them at unsuspecting individuals. In the mid-1980s garbage was set on fire and cemeteries were set ablaze. In Camden, New Jersey, Mischief Night escalated to the point that in the 1990s widespread arson was committed, with more than 130 arson attacks on the night of October 30, 1991.

By the end of the 2010s, the destructive elements of Devil&#x27;s Night in Detroit had largely ceased to exist. In 2018, formal support of Angels&#x27; Night was ended with city resources being instead allocated to host neighborhood Halloween parties. Devil&#x27;s Night 2018 recorded a total of five structure fires, with only four on the night before. Devil&#x27;s Night 2021 saw the lowest totals in multiple decades, with only three structure fires recorded. In the 2010s, the decline of Devil&#x27;s Night fires coincided with an increase in similar arson on the nights surrounding the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

<doc id="1115794" wikidata="Q2119406" url="?curid=1115794" title="Ince Blundell">
<text>Ince Blundell is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in the ceremonial county of Merseyside and historic county of Lancashire, England. It is situated to the north of Liverpool on the A565 road and to the east of the village of Hightown. There are two associated hamlets of Lady Green and Carr Houses.

==History==
Ince Blundell is probably the oldest settlement within the Borough of Sefton. The name Ince comes from &quot;Hinne&quot; a Celtic word meaning &quot;island in the marsh&quot;. This name bears evidence to Ince lying on a sandy ridge in the Alt valley, a place that in the past had been marshland.

In the 14th century, John Blundell, whose family were the predominant landowners in the area, added his surname to Ince. This was to distinguish it from the Ince in Cheshire and Ince-in-Makerfield near Wigan. Built from 1720, Ince Blundell Hall was the home of the Blundells of Ince, who became the Weld-Blundells, until 1959. The house is a Grade II* listed building, and is now a nursing home run by the Canonesses of Saint Augustine.

==Governance==
From 1997 until 2010 the village and civil parish of Ince Blundell was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency was abolished with Sefton East, including Ince Blundell, being merged with the northern parts of the former Crosby constituency, which was also abolished, to form the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council, the village and civil parish of Ince Blundell is part of Ravenmeols electoral ward which has three councillors. Two are members of the Formby Residents Action Group (FRAG), Bob McCann (who also sits on the Ince Blundell Parish Council), Maria Bennett, and the third councillor, Nina Killen, represents the Labour party.

==Description==
There is a village hall with a Tearoom attached, The Sunshine Tearooms, open Monday to Saturday. On the site of the old Weld Blundell Public house there is now a Euro garage with a Spar, Greggs and Starbucks attached. There is also a pub, the Pheasant, a short distance away at the other end of Orrell Hill Lane at its junction with Moss Lane.

In 2006 and 2007, Ince Blundell entered the North West in Bloom competition, part of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Britain in Bloom campaign.

==Ince Blundell Hall statues==
Ince Blundell Hall was noted for the collection of marble statues from Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, as well as 17th and 18th-century Italian sculptures by artists such as Carlo Albacini and Bartolomeo Cavaceppi. They were collected by Henry Blundell and housed first in a purpose-built Garden Temple (1792), and later in a scaled-down version of the Pantheon (1802–1804). The ancient sculptures, including some from Hadrian&#x27;s Villa at Tivoli, are now located in the World Museum, Liverpool. Henry Blundell also collected paintings and furniture, some of which is also at the Walker Art Gallery. Henry&#x27;s estranged son Charles Robert Blundell (1761–1837) made a large collection of drawings many of which are also at the Walker.

<text>Augustus Edward Hough Love FRS (17 April 1863, Weston-super-Mare – 5 June 1940, Oxford), often known as A. E. H. Love, was a mathematician famous for his work on the mathematical theory of elasticity. He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in &quot;Some Problems of Geodynamics&quot; won for him the Adams prize in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves. 
Love also contributed to the theory of tidal locking and introduced the parameters known as Love numbers, used in problems related to Earth tides, the tidal deformation of the solid Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun.

== Life and career ==
He was educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School and in 1881 won a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics. His successful progress (he was placed Second Wrangler) vindicated his choice of mathematics, and in 1886 he was elected Fellow of the college. In 1899 he was appointed Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Oxford, a position which he retained until his death in 1940. He was also a Fellow of Queen&#x27;s College.

He authored the two volume classic, &quot;&quot;. He was the author of several articles in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, including Elasticity and Infinitesimal Calculus.

His other awards include the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1909 and Sylvester Medal in 1937, and the London Mathematical Society De Morgan Medal in 1926. He was secretary to the London Mathematical Society between 1895 and 1910, and president for 1912–1913.

<doc id="1115801" wikidata="Q21468843" url="?curid=1115801" title="Fair and unfair play">
<text>Law 41 of the Laws of Cricket covers unfair play. This law has developed and expanded over time as various incidents of real life unfair play have been legislated against.

The first section of Law 41 makes clear that the captains of the two teams have the responsibility for ensuring that play is conducted according to the spirit and traditions of the game, as well as within its Laws. This leads to a statement that the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. It contains an override of the Laws of Cricket: if either umpire considers an action that is not covered by the laws to be unfair, he can intervene and call the ball dead.

Fair and unfair play can also refer simply to conventions of the game that are often seen to conform with the Spirit of Cricket.

==Ball tampering==

The state of the ball affects deliveries to a batsman. Even a new cricket ball is not perfectly spherical, but in two parts stitched together to form a seam. How a ball moves depends in part on how much air resistance there is to different parts of the ball, and therefore to what degree the ball has deteriorated. A cricket team will normally seek, for example, to polish one side of the ball and rough up the other side. The resulting variation in air resistance on the ball can have a marked effect.

Ball tampering has always been a feature of the sport. Players would use objects to rough up one side of the ball, and use resins and substances like Brylcreem to shine the other. This sort of ball tampering is against the spirit of the game and has always been against the rules. Despite this, it has always gone on with limited sanction, and it can be difficult to spot.

The television age has meant that from the 1990s onwards most international games have been televised. Slow motion replays have highlighted a number of incidents of ball tampering: some of which have been widely reported in the press (such as with the Sandpapergate incident). The third section of Law 41 contains the rules and sanctions against ball tampering and requires the umpires to make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball to counter it. It also contains punitive measures against fielders who do tamper with the ball. Match suspensions may be implemented.

Some acts that may alter the ball are permitted. A fielder may polish the ball as long as no artificial substance is used, remove mud from the ball under the supervision of the umpire and dry a wet ball on a towel. But no-one may rub the ball on the ground for any reason, interfere with any of the seams or the surface of the ball, use any implement, or take any other action whatsoever which is likely to alter the condition of the ball.

If a player illegally changes the condition of the ball, the umpires replace the ball with another one with similar wear to the old ball before the ball tampering. The umpires also award five penalty runs to the opposing team and report the incident to the authorities to which the player is responsible. These authorities are then expected to take further disciplinary action against the player as appropriate. If there is a further incidence of ball tampering in the innings the same procedure is followed, but the bowler of the immediately preceding ball is banned from bowling further in that innings too if the tampering was committed by the fielding side.

==Distracting the opposition==

If a member of the fielding side deliberately distracts or attempts to distract the batsman on strike while he is preparing to receive or receiving a delivery, the umpire immediately declares the ball to be dead. The umpire also informs the fielding captain of the incident and awards five penalty runs to the batting side. The batsman may not be dismissed from the delivery, which must be repeated.

It is also unfair for a member of the fielding side to deliberately attempt to distract or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball by word or action. If this happens a procedure similar to the procedure for the first instance of ball tampering occurs, although the batting side also scores any runs that they have scored before the attempted (or actual) distraction or obstruction.

The case of a batsman obstructing the fielding side is covered by Law 37 of the Laws of Cricket rather than Law 41. A batsman contravening Law 37 may be given out &quot;obstructing the field&quot;.

==Unfair bowling==

The bowling of fast short pitched balls may be judged dangerous by the umpire considering their speed, length, height and direction in relation to the skill of the batsman. The umpire calls no-ball and cautions the bowler. If this happens a second time, the bowler is barred from bowling again in that innings, and is also reported to the responsible authority for possible further action. 

Even if not judged dangerous, repetitive short-pitched bowling over head height may be judged unfair. Each individual instance is called no-ball (or wide in the professional game) without contextual judgement of fairness, but if the umpire decides too many have been bowled, will intervene with the sequence of warning, suspension and reporting. Professional cricket has several different codes on this, stating how many instances constitutes unfair.

High full-pitched balls &quot;beamers&quot; that pass or would have passed the striker on the full above waist height are deemed dangerous. The same sanctions (no-ball, warning, suspension, reporting) apply as to fast short pitched balls. Beamers occur by mistake, when a ball slips in the bowler&#x27;s hand at the point of delivery, and bowlers usually immediately apologise to the batsman for their mistake. If one is judged to have been bowled deliberately, no-ball is immediately called, the bowler is removed and is reported to the responsible authority for further disciplinary action.

If the umpire considers a bowler has deliberately bowled a front-foot no-ball then the bowler is immediately suspended from bowling in that innings and reported to the authorities for further action.

==Time wasting==
Time wasting can be used as a deliberate tactic to affect the result of a game. If rain is forecast, a side that is in a losing position can play slow, with the hope that rain will save them and turn the result into a draw rather than a defeat. Time wasting can also be used tactically elsewhere in the game: for instance, to minimise the number of deliveries between a given time and an interval. Law 41 includes rules to counter unfair time wasting.

If the fielding side wastes time, or progresses an over unnecessarily slowly, it is first warned by the umpire. Any further occurrence, there is a further sanction. If the further occurrence happens otherwise than during an over, the batting side is awarded 5 penalty runs. If the further occurrence happens during an over, the bowler is banned from bowling further in the innings. In both instances the relevant Governing Body is informed so it may consider further disciplinary action.

In normal circumstances the striker should always be ready to take strike when the bowler is ready to start his run up. If he wastes time, in the first instance the batsman is warned by the umpire. That warning applies to the batting team as a whole and each incoming batsman is informed of that warning. If there is further time wasting by any batsman in that innings, the umpires award the fielding side 5 runs and inform the Governing Body so it may consider further disciplinary action.

==Damaging the pitch==
The central portion of the pitch (5 feet from each popping crease, and 1 foot either side of the line joining the centres of the two middle stumps) is designated a &quot;protected area&quot; (this is the area the ball will most often bounce in). The bowlers from the fielding side should not enter this area during the follow-through of their bowling action, nor should the batsman take guard within it or so close that they would frequently move into it. A bowler will get two warnings should they run into the protected area; should they encroach again, they will be suspended from bowling for the remainder of the innings. A batsman gets one warning and on subsequent transgressions incurs a 5 run penalty.

Each side must also avoid deliberate or avoidable damage to the whole of the pitch (there will be unavoidable damage due to the bowler running off the pitch after bowling and the batsman taking his stance by the popping crease). Each side gets on warning for avoidable damage, any subsequent instance of avoidable damage will see a 5 run penalty awarded to the other side.

==Batsmen stealing runs==

A bowler may attempt to run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he delivers the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball, with this being known as mankading. It is unfair for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler&#x27;s run-up. If they try the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires will call dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.

<text>The ERG theory is a theory of human need proposed by Clayton Alderfer, which developed Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs by categorizing needs relating to existence, relatedness and growth.

==Details of the theory==

In 1969, psychologist Clayton Alderfer developed Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs by categorizing the hierarchy into his ERG theory (Existence, Relatedness and Growth). The existence category is concerned with the need for providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. The relatedness category is concerned with the desire for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. The growth category is concerned with the desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow&#x27;s esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.

Alderfer categorized Maslow&#x27;s physiological needs and Maslow&#x27;s safety needs into the existence category, Maslow&#x27;s social needs and Maslow&#x27;s extrinsic component of self-esteem needs into the relatedness category, and Maslow&#x27;s intrinsic component of self-esteem needs and Maslow&#x27;s self-actualization needs into the growth category. Alderfer also proposed a progression and regression theory to go along with the ERG theory: he said that when needs in a lower category are satisfied, an individual will invest more efforts in the higher category, and when needs in a higher category are frustrated, an individual will invest more efforts in the lower category. For example, if self-esteem or self-actualization is not met then an individual will invest more effort in the relatedness category in the hopes of achieving the higher need.

== Publication ==
This theory was published originally in the journal &quot;Organizational Behavior and Human Performance&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Meredith&quot; (DD-165) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first destroyer in the United States Navy that named for a marine.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Meredith&quot;, named for Jonathan Meredith, was laid down 26 June 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 22 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. William F. Meredith, wife of the great-grandnephew of Sergeant Meredith; and commissioned at Boston 29 January 1919. Assigned to Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Meredith&quot; proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, for torpedoes and 18 February began a shakedown cruise to Cuba. However, she received orders 22 February to join five other destroyers as escort to &quot;George Washington&quot;, returning President Woodrow Wilson from France to Boston. On 26 February, she resumed her shakedown.

&quot;Meredith&quot; departed New York 1 May for Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, to serve as a guide post for the first transoceanic flight, as Navy Curtis flying boats spanned the Atlantic from Long Island to Plymouth, England. Returning to Boston 22 May, &quot;Meredith&quot; cruised the east and gulf coasts with Destroyer Flotilla 2 until November, then served out of Newport for training, particularly target practice, until November, when she went into repair at Norfolk.

Rejoining her division at Charleston, South Carolina, 26 January 1922, she participated in maneuvers until 5 April when she went into Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation. Decommissioned 28 June 1922, &quot;Meredith&quot; remained at Philadelphia until, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, she was sold for scrapping 29 September 1936.

<doc id="1115808" wikidata="Q4603179" url="?curid=1115808" title="2004 Osama bin Laden video">
<text>On October 29, 2004, at 21:00 UTC, Al Jazeera broadcast excerpts allegedly from a videotape of Osama bin Laden addressing the people of the United States; in this video, he accepts responsibility for the September 11 attacks, condemns the Bush government&#x27;s response to those attacks, and presents those attacks as part of a campaign of revenge and deterrence motivated by his witnessing of the destruction in the Lebanese Civil War in 1982. News analysts speculated that the release of the video was timed to influence the 2004 U.S. presidential election, which would take place four days later.

==Content==
The video is reported to be 18 minutes in length; bin Laden only speaks for 14 minutes 39 seconds. Al-Jazeera released a transcript of the complete tape on November 1, 2004.

Bin Laden appears wearing a turban and a white robe partially covered by a golden mantle, standing in front of an almost featureless brown background and reading his comments from papers resting on a lectern. He moves both of his arms (dispelling rumors that one of them is limp after having been wounded) and looks healthy as far as can be told, but a bit older and greyer than in his former tapes. His remarks, in Arabic but addressed to citizens of the United States, instruct them that &quot;the best way to avoid another Manhattan&quot; (a reference to the September 11, 2001 attacks), is to not threaten the security of Muslim nations, such as Palestine and Lebanon.

He speaks of his desire to bankrupt the United States, saying:

[It is] easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaeda, in order to make the generals race there and cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses. ... This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the mujahidin, bled Russia for 10 years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.

He dismisses as rhetoric claims by U.S. President George W. Bush that the attacks occurred because Islamic extremists &quot;hate freedom&quot;, saying: &quot;If Bush says we hate freedom, let him tell us why we didn&#x27;t attack Sweden, for example. It is known that freedom-haters don&#x27;t have defiant spirits like those of the 19—may God have mercy on them&quot;.

Bin Laden further accuses U.S. President George W. Bush of misleading the American people during the previous three years—&quot;Despite entering the fourth year after September 11, Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened&quot;—as well as criticizing Bush&#x27;s actions on the day of the attacks: &quot;It never occurred to us that the Commander-in-Chief of the country would leave 50,000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone, the time when they most needed him. But because it seemed to him that occupying himself because he thought by talking to the little girl about the goats and its butting was more important than occupying himself with the planes...&quot;

==Immediate reactions==
George W. Bush said:
Let me make this very clear: Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country. I&#x27;m sure Senator Kerry agrees with this. I also want to say to the American people that we&#x27;re at war with these terrorists and I am confident that we will prevail.

Democratic presidential nominee Senator John Kerry said:
Let me make it clear, crystal clear: as Americans, we are absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden and the terrorists. They are barbarians, and I will stop at absolutely nothing to hunt down, capture or kill the terrorists wherever they are, whatever it takes. Period.

==Intelligence response==

Even though Al Jazeera (when broadcasting the footage on its evening newscast) did not disclose the source of the video, sources within the United States intelligence community have confirmed that the speaker, who appears behind a lectern, is indeed bin Laden. By mentioning 2004 U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry by name, the tape seemed to prove that bin Laden was still alive at least midway through 2004, which was not known with certainty at the time.

According to the Agence France-Presse, U.S. diplomats in Qatar were given a copy of a videotape of bin Laden before it aired on Al Jazeera; the diplomats unsuccessfully sought to prevent the Arabic language network from broadcasting it. The United States State Department requested that the government of Qatar (where Al Jazeera is located) discourage the station from airing the videotape, according to a senior State Department official.

Even though the tape was analyzed by American intelligence to determine if it contains any coded messages to operatives, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan commented that there were no plans to raise the U.S. terrorism alert level, as no specific threats were made in the tape.

The same speculation has been made by Bahukutumbi Raman.

==Public response==
The 2004 tape boosted the popularity of President Bush. He opened up a six-point lead over Kerry in the first opinion poll to include sampling taken after the videotape was broadcast. However, Kerry won the category of people who considered the tape &quot;very important&quot; 53% to 47% according to CNN&#x27;s exit poll.

<doc id="1115810" wikidata="Q2020355" url="?curid=1115810" title="A Hanging">
<text>A Hanging (1931) is a short essay written by George Orwell, first published (under his real name) in August 1931 in the John Middleton Murry’s British literary magazine &quot;The Adelphi&quot; and then reprinted in 1946 in the British literary magazine &quot;The New Savoy&quot;. Set in Burma, where Orwell (under his real name of Eric Arthur Blair) had served in the British Imperial Police from 1922 to 1927, it describes the execution of a criminal.

==The story==
The condemned man is given no name, nor is it explained what crime he has committed. For the British police who supervise his execution, the hanging is an unpleasant but routine piece of business. The narrator takes no active part in the hanging, and appears to be less experienced than his colleagues. As the handcuffed prisoner is marched to the gallows he steps slightly aside to avoid treading in a puddle of rainwater; the narrator sees this, and reflects:
The hanging is carried out, and all concerned feel a sudden relief as they leave the scene where the dead man still hangs.

==Context==
Britain conquered Burma over 62 years (1824–86), during which three Anglo-Burmese Wars were fought, and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Britain administered Burma as an Indian province until 1937, when it became a separate, self-governing colony. Burma attained independence in 1948.

==Veracity==
When asked about &quot;A Hanging&quot;, Orwell was unwilling to discuss the subject, and once said that it was &quot;only a story.&quot; No known evidence shows specifically where and when he witnessed an execution during his time in Burma. In his writings, however, he repeated that he had done so. He further reflected upon hanging in his &quot;As I Please&quot; column for &quot;Tribune&quot;, 15 November 1946. According to Dennis Collings, a friend of Orwell from 1921, when his father became the Blair (Orwell) family doctor, it was certain Orwell would have witnessed a hanging, and that policemen had to see a hanging, &quot;as a kind of initiation. There had to be police officers present at executions—and cadets were assigned to that kind of thing.&quot;

<text>Henry Bouquet (born Henri Louis Bouquet; 1719 – 2 September 1765) was a Swiss mercenary who rose to prominence in British service during the French and Indian War and Pontiac&#x27;s War. He is best known for his victory over a Native American force at the Battle of Bushy Run, lifting the siege of Fort Pitt during Pontiac&#x27;s War. During the conflict Bouquet gained lasting infamy in an exchange of letters with his commanding officer, Jeffery Amherst, who suggested a form of biological warfare in the use of blankets infected with smallpox which were to be distributed to Native Americans. Despite this indictment historians have praised Bouquet for leading British forces in several demanding campaigns on the Western Frontier in which they &quot;protected and rescued&quot; settlers from increasingly frequent attacks.

==Early life==
Bouquet was born in Rolle, Switzerland, in 1719. He was likely the son of Isaac-Barthélemy Bouquet, a mercenary in the service of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and Madeleine Rolaz. Like many military officers of his day, Bouquet traveled between countries serving as a professional soldier. He began his military career in 1736 in the army of the Dutch Republic, and later in 1739 joined the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1748, he was again in Dutch service as lieutenant colonel of the Swiss guards.

==French and Indian War==

In 1756, Bouquet entered the British Army as a lieutenant colonel in the 60th Regiment of Foot (Royal American Regiment), a unit made up largely of members of Pennsylvania&#x27;s German immigrant community. After leading the Royal Americans to Charleston, South Carolina to bolster that city&#x27;s defences, the regiment was recalled to Philadelphia to take part in General John Forbes&#x27; expedition against Fort Duquesne in 1758.

While Bouquet travelled down the road from Fort Bedford, his troops were attacked by French and Indians at Loyalhanna, near present Ligonier, Pennsylvania, but the attack was repulsed and they continued on to Fort Duquesne, only to find it razed by the fleeing French.

==Pontiac&#x27;s War==
In 1763, bands of Native Americans joined forces to remove the British from their territory in what is most often called Pontiac&#x27;s War. Pontiac, an Ottawa war leader, began urging the Indian tribes that had been allied to the French during the French and Indian War to join together to continue the fight to remove the British from the territory. Pontiac initiated attacks on the westernmost frontier forts and settlements, believing the defeated French would rally and come to their aid. The start of the conflict is usually described as the siege of Fort Detroit on 10 May 1763. Fort Sandusky, Fort Michilimackinac, Fort Presque Isle, and numerous other frontier outposts were quickly overrun.

Several frontier forts in the Ohio Country had fallen to the allied tribes, and Fort Pitt, Fort Ligionier, and Fort Bedford along Forbes&#x27;s road were besieged or threatened. Bouquet, who was in Philadelphia, threw together a hastily organised force of 500 men, mostly Scots Highlanders, to relieve the forts. On 5 August 1763, Bouquet and the relief column were attacked by warriors from the Delaware, Mingo, Shawnee, and Wyandot tribes near a small outpost called Bushy Run, in what is now Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. In a two-day battle, Bouquet defeated the tribes and Fort Pitt was relieved. The battle marked a turning point in the war.

It was during Pontiac&#x27;s War that Bouquet gained a certain lasting infamy, when he ordered the men under his command to distribute smallpox-infested blankets from the infirmary to besieging Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763. During a parley in midst of the siege on June 24, 1763, Captain Simeon Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares small metal boxes containing two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, in an attempt to spread the disease to the Natives in order to end the siege. After the end of the war, Levy, Trent and Company, of which William Trent was a member of, submitted a reimbursement invoice on which was written: &quot;To Sundries got to Replace in kind those which were taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians Vizt.&quot; General Thomas Gage approved reimbursement to the company. A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and they seemingly hadn&#x27;t contracted smallpox. Smallpox was highly contagious among the Native Americans, and – together with measles, influenza, chicken pox, and other Old World diseases – was a major cause of death since the arrival of Europeans and their animals.

The journal of Trent, who served the commander of the militia at the fort, has provided evidence that this plan was carried out:
&quot;[June] 24th [1763] The Turtles Heart a principal Warrior of the Delawares and Mamaltee a Chief came within a small distance of the Fort Mr. McKee went out to them and they made a Speech letting us know that all our [POSTS] as Ligonier was destroyed, that great numbers of Indians [were coming and] that out of regard to us, they had prevailed on 6 Nations [not to] attack us but give us time to go down the Country and they desired we would set of immediately. The Commanding Officer thanked them, let them know that we had everything we wanted, that we could defend it against all the Indians in the Woods, that we had three large Armys marching to Chastise those Indians that had struck us, told them to take care of their Women and Children, but not to tell any other Natives, they said they would go and speak to their Chiefs and come and tell us what they said, they returned and said they would hold fast of the Chain of friendship. Out of our regard to them we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect. They then told us that Ligonier had been attacked, but that the Enemy were beat of.&quot;

A month later in a series of letters between Bouquet and his commander, General Jeffery Amherst, the idea of using smallpox blankets was proposed and agreed upon to infect the Indians by giving them infected blankets. Amherst wrote to Bouquet, then in Lancaster, on about 29 June 1763: &quot;Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.&quot; Bouquet agreed, replying to Amherst on 13 July: &quot;I will try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself.&quot; Amherst responded on 16 July: &quot;You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.&quot;

By the autumn of 1764, Bouquet had become the commander of Fort Pitt. To subdue the ongoing Indian uprising, he led a force of nearly 1,500 militiamen and regular British soldiers from the fort into the Ohio Country. On 13 October 1764, Bouquet&#x27;s men reached the Tuscarawas River. Shortly thereafter, representatives from the Shawnees, Senecas, and Delawares came to Bouquet to sue for peace.

Bouquet then moved his men from the Tuscarawas River to the Muskingum River at modern-day Coshocton, Ohio. This placed him in the heart of tribal lands and would allow him to quickly strike the natives&#x27; villages if they refused to cooperate. As part of the peace treaty, Bouquet demanded the return of all white captives in exchange for a promise not to destroy the Indian villages or seize any of their land. The return of the captives caused much bitterness among the tribesmen, because many of them had been forcibly adopted into Indian families as small children, and living among the Native Americans had been the only life they remembered. Some &#x27;white Indians&#x27; such as Rhoda Boyd managed to escape back into the native villages; many others were never exchanged. Bouquet was responsible for the return more than 200 white captives to the settlements back east.

==Later years==
In 1765, Bouquet was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of all British forces in the southern colonies. He died in Pensacola, West Florida, on 2 September 1765.

==In literature==
Bouquet is referred to in Conrad Richter&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot;, which tells the story of one young man returned to his white family as part of the 1764 treaty. The Colonel is also referred to in Paul Muldoon&#x27;s poem, &quot;Meeting the British&quot;.

<doc id="1115823" wikidata="Q7296455" url="?curid=1115823" title="Ravenite Social Club">
<text>The Ravenite Social Club was an Italian American heritage club at 247 Mulberry Street, in Little Italy, New York City. It was used as a mob hangout and the storefront later became a shoe store, and as of 2022 is a men&#x27;s clothing store.

==History==
The club was founded in 1926, first as the Alto Knights Social Club (after an old street gang during Prohibition), and later became a hangout for Charlie Luciano and others. The Alto Knights name was derived from the Order of Saint James of Altopascio. In 1957, when Carlo Gambino took over, he renamed the club &quot;The Ravenite&quot; in honor of his favorite poem by Edgar Allan Poe, &quot;The Raven&quot;; but Gambino stopped habituating the club when he discovered police had a growing interest in surveillance of the club. It then became under the management of Aniello Dellacroce.

It was frequented and used as the headquarters of the Gambino crime family in the late 1970s and 1980s. Around 1990, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to infiltrate the Mafia using secret electronic surveillance, because John Gotti used an apartment above the Ravenite; the FBI subsequently sent agents to install voice recorders and other wiretaps inside the apartment. The FBI then used recordings from secret Mafia meetings in that apartment against Gotti. Exterior surveillance also recorded numerous union officials outside the Ravenite, helping the FBI in connecting the boss of the Gambino crime family to the city&#x27;s labor unions.

<doc id="1115824" wikidata="Q1388778" url="?curid=1115824" title="List of tallest buildings in Boston">
<text>Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the largest city in New England, is home to 585 completed high-rises, 37 of which stand taller than . The city&#x27;s skyscrapers and high-rises are concentrated along the roughly 2.5 mile High Spine, which runs from the Back Bay to the Financial District and West End, while bypassing the surrounding low-rise residential neighborhoods. The tallest structure in Boston is the 60-story 200 Clarendon, better known to locals as the John Hancock Tower, which rises in the Back Bay district. It is also the tallest building in New England and the 80th-tallest building in the United States. The second-tallest building in Boston is the Prudential Tower, which rises 52 floors and . At the time of the Prudential Tower&#x27;s completion in 1964, it stood as the tallest building in North America outside of New York City.

Boston&#x27;s history of skyscrapers began with the completion in 1893 of the 13-story Ames Building, which is considered the city&#x27;s first high-rise. Boston went through a major building boom in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in the construction of over 20 skyscrapers, including 200 Clarendon and the Prudential Tower. The city is the site of 25 skyscrapers that rise at least in height, more than any other city in New England. , the skyline of Boston is ranked 10th in the United States and 79th in the world with 57 buildings rising at least in height.

Since August 2017, several major development projects have dramatically altered the city&#x27;s skyline, including the Millennium Tower, Avalon North Station, Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Private Residences, One Dalton Street, The Hub on Causeway, and Bulfinch Crossing. In addition, there has been a continuous stream of proposals to construct skyscrapers that would rank among the tallest in the city if completed. Overall, there were 64 high-rise buildings under construction or proposed for construction in Boston.

==Tallest buildings==
Boston skyscrapers that stand at least 400 feet (122 m) tall, based on standard height measurements, including spires and other architectural details, but not including antenna masts, are listed below. (The letter (T) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings. The &quot;Year&quot; column indicates the year when a building was completed.) 


==Tallest buildings by pinnacle height==
Boston skyscrapers based on their pinnacle height, which includes radio masts and antennas, are listed below. As architectural features and spires can be regarded as subjective, some skyscraper enthusiasts prefer this method of measurement. Standard architectural height measurement, which excludes antennas in building height, is included for comparative purposes. 
== Tallest under construction, approved, and proposed ==

* Table entries with dashes (—) indicate that information regarding building dates of completion has not yet been released.

==Timeline of tallest buildings==
For most of Boston&#x27;s earlier years, the tallest buildings in the city were churches with their steeples. The first skyscraper in the city is generally considered the Ames Building, completed in 1893. However, since the 13-story building did not surpass the steeple of the Church of the Covenant, it never became a city record holder. The first skyscraper to have the distinction of being Boston&#x27;s tallest building was the Custom House Tower, completed in 1915.

In his 30s, English businessman William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme had taken a boat trip and fallen in love with the Western Isles of Scotland. In May 1918, at the age of 66, he bought the Isle of Lewis for £167,000, convinced that he could resurrect the fishing industry. But his investment floundered in 1919 when servicemen, demobilised from the First World War and promised land, started occupying plots on the Isle of Lewis. Leverhulme protested and took legal action against the people he considered squatters, but the Scottish Office took the side of the ex-servicemen, leaving Leverhulme&#x27;s plan in tatters.

Still looking to develop his fishing plan, in late 1919 he purchased the South Harris estate from the Earl of Dunmore for the sum of £36,000. Taking in the fishing village of Obbe (deriving from a Norse word for a bay), he planned to turn it into a consolidated major fishing centre, with fish distributed through the 400+ Mac Fisheries fishmonger shops. He chose the site because it gave access to the waters of both the Minch and the Atlantic Ocean and his boats could always find sheltered fishing waters.

Nigel Nicolson, in his book: &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1960), writes: &quot;Leverhulme did not search long for the site of his harbour. He found it at Obbe. It was a pity that he and his advisers did not give the matter further thought before embarking on the engineering works, for Obbe was not the best possible site. Tarbert would have been preferable, for it had deep sheltered water, and it would not have been beyond Leverhulme&#x27;s scope to dig a canal through the narrow isthmus linking the East and West Lochs Tarbert, and so provide his boats with access to the seas on both sides of the Hebrides. This proposal was urged on him at an early stage by Duncan Maciver; and his personal representative in Lewis, Colonel Walter Lindsay (who had apparently not heard of Maciver&#x27;s idea), raised it again in October 1920. &quot;It struck me yesterday,&quot; he wrote to Leverhulme, &quot;that it would be a great advantage if a canal could be cut at Tarbert, as there is extremely good anchorage in both lochs.&quot; But it was in that very month that work at Leverburgh began in earnest. Why Leverhulme discarded the obvious claims of a Tarbert canal is not clear. Perhaps he feared its proximity to Stornoway, or did not wish to harm the interests of the thriving community of fishermen on the isle of Scalpay at the entrance to the east loch. Or perhaps it was for the more personal reason that once the decision had been taken to rechristen Obbe &quot;Leverburgh&quot;, it became unthinkable to abandon it.&quot;

In 1920, with local consent, Obbe was renamed Leverburgh, and 300 men started work on a new pier and seashore infrastructure for processing the catch from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, curing sheds, smoke houses, a refrigeration building, store sheds, houses for the managers and a twenty car garage.

With a second stage of development planned that would have seen the inner sea loch converted into a harbour to accommodate 200+ trawlers, fitted with a sea lock to ensure a constant depth, Leverhulme paid for upgraded roads to accommodate the additional traffic.

After purchasing the London butchers Wall&#x27;s in 1920, the economic downturn of 1920–1921 slowed development, resulting in the London-based Mac Fisheries being incorporated into Lever Brothers Ltd in 1922. By 1924 Leverburgh was ready to start production, and 12 Great Yarmouth drifters landed a quantity of herring so great that extra female employees were taken in from the mainland to handle the catch.

After making his last visit to Leverburgh in September 1924, Leverhulme took a trip to Africa, where he developed pneumonia. After his death in 1925, his executors and the board of Lever Brothers had no interest in the Leverburgh project, and so ended all work. They sold off the village and production facilities for £5,000, and the estate for £300, to the Campbell brothers, a local family. It is estimated that the project cost Leverhulme £500,000 ().

==Facilities==

A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service links Leverburgh with Berneray, connected to North Uist by a causeway.

The Post Office serving the village was established in 1873 and had its name changed from Obbe to Leverburgh in December 1920.

The nearby area is known for its beautiful beaches, especially along the west coast road.

<text>The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the regulator for nursing and midwifery professions in the UK. The NMC maintains a register of all nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses and nursing associates eligible to practise within the UK. It sets and reviews standards for their education, training and performances. The NMC also investigates allegations of impaired fitness to practise (i.e. where these standards are not met).

It has been a statutory body since 2002, with a stated aim to protect the health and well-being of the public. The NMC is also a charity registered with the Charity Commission, charity number 1091434 and in Scotland with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, charity number SC038362. All Council members are trustees of the charity.

== History ==

=== UKCC ===
In 1983, the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) was set up following the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979, replacing the General Nursing Council for England and Wales established by the Nurses Registration Act 1919, the Central Midwives Board in London and seven other bodies. The UKCC was expected to maintain a register of UK nurses, midwives and health visitors, provide guidance to registrants, and handle professional misconduct complaints. At the same time, National Boards were created for each of the UK countries. Their main functions were to monitor the quality of nursing and midwifery education courses, and to maintain the training records of students on these courses.

In 1990 the UKCC introduced Project 2000 a higher education scheme in the United Kingdom for nursing qualifications. In 1991 the UKCC agreed on proposals for Post-registration Education and Practice (PREP). PREP took several years to introduce, with the final framework being agreed in 1994, and the scheme itself being introduced in 1995. PREP developed into the current scheme of Revalidation which was implemented in April 2016.

=== Establishment of NMC ===
This structure of the UKCC survived with minor modifications up to April 2002, when the UKCC ceased to exist and its functions were taken over by a new Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). This was legislated for in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, through the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001. The English National Board was also abolished and its quality assurance function was taken on board by the NMC. The other National Boards were also abolished, but new bodies were created in each country to take over their functions.

== Council ==
The NMC Council has two key roles: setting the strategic direction for the NMC and overseeing the work of senior NMC staff.

The Council ensures that the NMC complies with all relevant legislation, including the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 and the Charities Act 1993.

The council is made up of 12 lay and registrant members, including one member from each of the four UK countries. They are appointed by the Privy Council. Registrant members are from a nursing or midwifery background; lay members are selected for their expertise in various fields and strategic experience.

The current Council took office on 1 May 2013.

== Role ==
The NMC&#x27;s role is to:
* protect the health and wellbeing of the public
* set standards of education, training, conduct and performance so that nurses and midwives can deliver high quality healthcare consistently throughout their careers
* ensure that nurses and midwives keep their skills and knowledge up to date and uphold the NMC&#x27;s professional standards, and
* have clear and transparent processes to investigate nurses and midwives who fall short of the NMC&#x27;s standards.

== Activities ==

The NMC has an annual income in excess of £52 million and employs over 400 staff. To fulfill the activities of the NMC it charges a registration fee to its members.

=== Education ===

The NMC set standards, guidance and requirements for nursing and midwifery education across the UK. These standards help to shape the content and design of programmes and state what a registered nurse or midwife needs to know and be able to do.

The NMC approves higher education institutions to deliver programmes. They currently accredit 1000 programmes in 79 education institutions across the UK.

When students successfully complete their programme, their education institution will let the NMC know that they have met the education and practice standards and are of good health and good character. If they are deemed fit to practise they will then be eligible to apply to join the register. Each year the NMC receives over 22,000 newly qualified nurses and midwives from education institutions.

=== Registering nurses and midwives ===

 there are 690,773 nurses and midwives on the NMC register, meaning the NMC is the body responsible for regulating the largest number of healthcare professionals in the UK. Nurses and midwives must be on the NMC register to practise in the UK. Anyone is able to search the NMC register.

=== Registering nursing associates ===

As of June 2019, there are 1,000 nursing associates on the NMC register.

=== Setting standards ===

The NMC&#x27;s revised code became effective on 31 March 2015. The code contains professional standards of practice and behaviour that all nurses and midwives must keep to.
Four key sections describe what nurses and midwives are expected to do:
• prioritise people
• practise effectively
• preserve safety, and
• promote professionalism and trust.

The Code was updated to reflect changes in healthcare and society since its last publication in 2008. The updates include new requirements on the fundamentals of care, the duty of candour, raising concerns and social media use.

The introduction to the code states: “When joining our register, and then renewing their registration, nurses and midwives commit to upholding these standards. This commitment to professional standards is fundamental to being part of a profession. We can take action if registered nurses or midwives fail to uphold the Code. In serious cases, this can include removing them from the register. The Code should be useful for everyone who cares about good nursing and midwifery.”

=== Revalidation ===

The NMC has committed to developing and implementing a system of revalidation. In October 2015, the NMC introduced the new system which all nurses and midwives in the UK must go through to remain on the NMC register. Nurses and midwives will need to renew their registration every three years and confirm that they continue to remain fit to practise by meeting the principles of the revised Code. They must demonstrate that they have completed the required hours of practice and learning activity through continuing professional development, have used feedback to review and improve the way they work, and have received confirmation from someone well placed to comment on their continuing fitness to practise.

The NMC ran a public consultation from January to March 2014 on how revalidation can be applied in practice. Pilots involving over 2,000 nurses and midwives across the UK would inform the final plans. Revalidation for nurses and midwives will start on 1 April 2016, with approximately 16,000 nurses and midwives going through the process initially. All nurses on the NMC register will eventually go through revalidation when their registration is up for renewal. In January 2016, the NMC launched a microsite to assist nurses and midwives through the revalidation process. 

=== Managing complaints about nurses and midwives ===

The NMC handles complaints made about nurses and midwives, and investigates allegations where appropriate. The NMC has the power to restrict a nurse or midwife&#x27;s practice or strike them off their register.

The NMC produced guidance for nurses and midwives on raising concerns which aims to help them take action in the public interest when needed. It includes information on legislation that offers protection to whistleblowers and information on organisations nurses and midwives can go to for further advice.

Helene Donnelly, ambassador for cultural change at Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Partnership NHS Trust, spoke to NMC Council about raising concerns and gave her support to the guidance.

== Legislation ==

=== Changes to healthcare regulation ===
On 2 April 2014, the Law Commission published its draft bill, Regulation of Health and Social Care Professionals. The bill aims &quot;to aim to sweep away the out-dated and inflexible decision-making processes associated with the current legislation.&quot; The bill would give healthcare regulators in the UK more autonomy.

The NMC&#x27;s Chief Executive and Registrar Jackie Smith welcomed the publication of the draft bill, but stated how the NMC needs the bill to become law quickly if it is able to modernise and become an efficient regulator. In its current legislative framework, the NMC spends nearly 80% of its income of fitness to practise hearings.

===Affecting regulation of professionals within the EU===

The revised Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MRPQ) Directive, which came into effect on 19 January 2016, brought in a number of changes that aimed to further facilitate the free movement of professionals within the EU, including amendments to language controls. The changes will enable the NMC to ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that a nurse or midwife from the EU has sufficient knowledge and command of English to practise safely and effectively.

== Criticism ==

=== Accusations of bullying and racism ===

On 11 March 2008 two Members of Parliament, Jim Devine and John Smith, made accusations in the House of Commons of bullying and racism within the NMC. The accusations have been denied by the NMC. The government set up an independent inquiry asking the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and the Charity Commission to investigate.

The NMC have been accused of nepotism by its members, Nursing Standard, letters-2017. Due to senior members of the NMC also being the instigating officer in cases against nurses, belonging to the same NHS Trust. In one instance a nurse was struck off for a data issue; whereas another nurse witnessed assaulting patients was only suspended for one year. (BFNHST, 2017).

In July 2024 an independent review of the NMC&#x27;s culture highlighted safeguarding concerns, and found that people working in the organisation have experienced racism, discrimination and bullying. Their new chief executive resigned after four days in post. In their response, the governing council of the NMC apologised to those who had experienced racism, discrimination and bullying. 

=== Panorama controversy ===

On 16 April 2009, nurse Margaret Haywood was barred from practising as a Nurse in the UK following a ruling by the NMC Conduct and Competence committee panel. This followed Haywood&#x27;s contribution to a BBC Panorama television programme, exposing significant deficiencies in care at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, an acute teaching hospital in Brighton, England. The public and media response was generally antagonistic towards the NMC, the response being described by the Royal College of Nursing as &#x27;unduly harsh&#x27;. On 12 October 2009, the striking off order was dropped, and replaced with a one-year caution.

=== Regulatory criticism ===

In an early July 2012 report, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE), now known as the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), critically examined the leadership of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. In late July 2012, a new chair for the NMC, Mark Addison, was appointed by the privy council, an appointment which was subject to criticism by the NMC Council, who described their &quot;grave concern&quot; with regard to what they claimed was a &quot;lack of an open, transparent and equal opportunities process&quot; in regards to the appointment. In contrast, the CHRE stated that they were pleased with the appointment of a new chair, and that they would &quot;look forward to working with Mark Addison&quot;. On 26 June 2015, the PSA reported in their performance review 2014–2015 report that the NMC had made overall improvements in their performance.

=== Data loss ===

In March 2013 the NMC was fined £150,000 by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office after it admitted that personal data, including &quot;highly sensitive&quot; information about nurses and about vulnerable children, had been placed on DVD without being encrypted, sent by courier and then lost. The ICO said that &quot;it should have been obvious ... that such a contravention would be of a kind likely to cause substantial distress to the data subjects due to the nature of the data involved&quot;.

=== Increase in membership cost ===
The cost charged to remain registered on the NMC has increased from £76 per year in 2013, to £100 in 2014. Since 2015 the registration fee is £120. The annual registration fee to the NMC is an allowable expense for UK income tax, however a survey by the NMC discovered that more than 75 per cent of NMC registrants do not claim tax relief on their registration.

===Morecambe Bay===
The council was criticised by Bill Kirkup for the way it handled the investigation resulting from events at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust relating to misconduct by two midwives involved in the Furness General Hospital scandal. He said their response to his report had &quot;fallen far short of expectations&quot;. The Professional Standards Authority said the regulator&#x27;s investigation was &quot;deficient&quot; because evidence was not presented to the panel by the council, even though it had it in its possession. In 2018 the authority reported that the council had ignored more than 20 concerns raised by Cumbria police in 2012 for two years and that its handling of complaints was “frequently incompetent”. There was poor behaviour by staff towards families, reluctance to take concerns seriously and a lack of openness about mistakes it had made. The chief executive, Jackie Smith, resigned.

===English language test===
As at 2021 the basic requirement was the UKVI Academics ILETS 7.0 for reading, listening, and speaking and 6.5 for writing or UKVI general ILETS 4.0 &amp; OET Grade B.

The process of registering nurses from abroad includes an English language test which has been criticised as too difficult. According to Sir Andrew Foster, “There are thousands of nurses, who came to the UK in the early 2000s and after, who had qualified as nurses in India but can’t get registration here because they have not passed the language test.” Peter Mount, former chair of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said the language requirements were to ensure patient safety, although when questioned but NMC have no evidence of fitness to practise cases being brought against overseas nurses related to language weakness. &quot;I am aware of nurses who have taken these language tests over 10 times and have been living and working in care and health settings in [the] UK for over 10 years.-- The test is said to be discriminatory because it demands an academic standard of reading and writing that many native English speakers could not meet. This means at least 3,000 qualified nurses from India who are already in the UK are not on the register, and so are paid less for similar work. British applicants generally are only required to have Grade C GCSE. In September 2022, after a consultation exercise, the Council agreed to changes which were intended to slightly relax the testing procedures.

== Regulator ==
The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, which promotes the health and wellbeing of the public and oversees the nine UK healthcare regulators, including the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

In 2015 it was suggested that the costs of regulating the Nursing and Midwifery Council would be paid for by the membership of the NMC i.e. nurses and midwives.

In 2015 the PSA published the 2014 audit it had undertaken of the NMC which found that whilst it had improved, it was still failing in areas.

<text>Netherton is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside, England.

==Description==
Netherton is situated in the southern part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, approximately 6 miles north of Liverpool City Centre. Netherton neighbours Thornton, Litherland, Aintree, Walton and Sefton Village.

Netherton is a mostly residential area, comprising the semi-rural Netherton Village, (which consists of privately owned houses set around the old Village Green) and the large council estate built by the former Bootle Borough Council on the other side of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

The estate is unusual in the fact that many of the houses are still occupied by the same residents who moved in as young couples with families when the houses were brand new. The social profile of the first resident population does not comply to modern notions of council estate dwellers. Many of these people were hard working people with middle class aspirations, whose lives and careers were interrupted and often changed forever by the Second World War. However, the demographics of the Netherton area have changed significantly over time. A large number of the male residents moved in from all parts of the country to be key skilled workers at the English Electric factory heavy engineering works on Dunnings Bridge Road.

The main estate, centred on Marian Square, was built in the mid 1950s to alleviate housing shortages in Bootle after the heavy bombing the town suffered during the Second World War. Historical records show that of about 18,000 houses in Bootle, only about 1,000 survived the German bombings completely intact. A remaining 16,000 houses were partially damaged and over a thousand completely destroyed.

The Sefton Estate (which includes Stonyfield, Waterside, Harrops Croft and Higher End Park) was built by Lancashire County Council some ten years after the Netherton estate in the mid 1960s and were the first council houses in the area to have central heating.

Marian Square is opposite the health centre in Magdalene Square (the two squares are divided by Glovers Lane, and should not be confused). The first shops (approximately five, including a health clinic and opticians) were built on Magdalene Square and were later demolished when the new shops and first new post office on Marian Square were opened. The original plans for the redevelopment for Magdalene Square, which were on view as a model in Bootle Town Hall in 1965, were for a 22 storey tower block and a leisure complex including swimming pool, neither of which were built (probably due to a lack of further investment in the area).

There were also plans for a large ring road to link the motorways at Switch Island, running across fields to the north of the Sefton estate with the centre of Bootle and the landward side of Crosby, along a corridor of land which included the Rimrose Valley. The council purchased land along this corridor but the road was never built. There is a large mound of earth next to the small church near the Cabbage Inn (near the present fire station); which shows the start of the earthworks for the flyover linking the proposed ring road to the goods depot on the railway line near the Girobank building on Netherton Way. The proposed ring road is shown on some old Liverpool A to Z street plans.

The unused land in the Rimrose Valley was made into an area of parkland, and new houses are being built on the old allotments at the other end of the Rimrose Valley in Litherland.

Notable firms which hold, or once held, premises in Netherton include:- Braby&#x27;s; English Electric; Forticrete; Metal Box; Movie (cleaning products); National Girobank; Peerless Refining Co.; North West Timber; Porter Chadburn; Post Office Telecommunications (British Telecom.); Scott&#x27;s Bakery (now part of Allied Bakeries) and now the site of a large trading estate including Odeon cinema, Matalan store, Dunelm mill furniture store and a pub called the Bakers Dozen; McDonald&#x27;s restaurant with drive thru, Subway restaurant with drive thru and to a Ben Dunne gym.

Netherton was formerly the home of the Everton F.C. youth academy, which has now been relocated to Finch Farm. The land was previously a fire station (the old brick building on the site) and the grounds of Littlewoods Social Club. This area has now been turned into a Goals football centre.

On 19 August 2015 the Thornton to Switch Island link road (A5758) was opened.

==History==
Before the Earl of Sefton relocated to Croxteth Hall in the late 18th century the family had a large estate in Netherton, with the main house and outbuildings located on the site of Our Lady of Walsingham school. The deer park is marked on numerous 17th and 18th century maps. and covered a large tract of land between what is now Bull Lane in Walton, Park Lane, Netherton Way, and Bootle Golf Course.

Netherton was anciently a township associated with the parish of Sefton, becoming an independent civil parish in 1866. It became part of Sefton Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894, and then West Lancashire Rural District in 1932.

Netherton parish lost areas to the county borough of Bootle in 1940, 1951 and 1968 (reducing the parish from in 1931 to in 1951). The residual parish no longer exists, forming part of Sefton parish.

The area has been a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton since local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974.

For parliamentary elections Netherton is within the Bootle constituency represented by the Labour Party MP Peter Dowd.

For elections to Sefton Council Netherton is split between the electoral wards of Netherton and Orrell, whose three representatives are Susan Ellen Bradshaw, Robert John Brennan, and Ian Ralph Maher, and St. Oswald, whose three representatives are Paula Spencer, Carla Thomas and Linda Cluskey. All six councillors who represent the Netherton area are members of the Labour Party.

==Architecture==
The oldest houses are to be found at the heart of the old hamlet of Netherton, clustered around the green in what is now known as Netherton Village, just north of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The old catholic church of St. Benet nearby was built in 1793. Unusually it appears as an ordinary house from the road with the church backing onto what was once open fields. A modern church was built over the road in the 1970s.

Nowadays, Netherton is formed with many modern housing, the most recent being the George Wimpey estate, completed in 2000, built just from Netherton Village green. Housing in this part of Netherton is considered rather desirable, unlike the council-owned housing closer to the town&#x27;s shopping amenities.

==Education==
Netherton is home to one secondary school, The Salesian Academy of St John Bosco. Formerly there was St Ambrose Barlow High School, Bootle Grammar School and Warwick Bolam County Secondary School as well as a Girl&#x27;s County Secondary School. In August 2009, Bootle High School closed its doors for the last time as students transferred to Litherland High School. In December 2009, works started to demolish the school on Browns Lane.
Now however the properties on the council estate are mostly privately owned and were bought under the right to buy scheme brought in by the conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. St Ambrose Barlow was formerly St. Catherine&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School and was for girls only, also closed on 11 November 2016. The corresponding boys&#x27; school was St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic High School, situated approximately on mile away on the other side of the canal.

==Transport==
Netherton is served by two railway-stations: Aintree and Old Roan, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. The Old Roan station is technically in Aintree, but is on the border between the two areas. Old Roan bus station is next to the railway-station. Buses run from here and Magdalene Square into central Liverpool (those from Magdalene Square also serve parts of Bootle) as well as North to Maghull, Ormskirk and Southport.

The area is situated close to the major interchange, Switch Island, at the end of the M57 and M58 motorways.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal flows through Netherton and whilst this provides a local amenity, there is very little boat traffic on this stretch of its course.

<doc id="1115837" wikidata="Q2458541" url="?curid=1115837" title="Thornton, Merseyside">
<text>Thornton is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside, England. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire and situated to the north east of Crosby, it is a residential area of semi-detached and detached housing which dates mainly from the 1930s. Many of the houses, particularly those around Edge Lane and Water Street, feature notably long gardens. The A565 Liverpool-Southport road serves the area. At the 2001 Census the population of the village and civil parish was recorded as 2,262, falling to 2,139 at the Census 2011.

==History==
Historically part of Lancashire. During the compilation of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in 1086, the settlement of &quot;Torentún&quot; is recorded, along with the settlement of Homer Green, which far outdates any claim that Ince Blundell is the oldest village in Sefton. Thornton was combined with Crosby Village and Blundellsands to form the Great Crosby urban district. The district subsequently became part the municipal borough of Crosby in 1937. Thornton was still served by West Lancashire Council until the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on 1 April 1974. Thornton still however retains Parish Council status and therefore has a historical boundary.

==Governance==
From 1950 until 2010 Thornton was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 till 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MP&#x27;s elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Thornton, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council Thornton is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.

==Description==
The Parish Council consists of seven councillors, who are all local residents. They meet on the first Monday of each month at Holy Family Catholic High School. Notice of these meetings are displayed on the Parish website and on the village notice board on The Crescent.

There are three schools in Thornton: St William Of York RC Primary School, Holy Family Catholic High School and Thornton College, which is an annexe of Hugh Baird College. In 2003, Cherie Blair QC, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, officially came to Thornton to open Holy Family&#x27;s new Sixth Form building.
There are two churches in Thornton: The King&#x27;s Church, Drummond Road and St William Of York RC Church, St William Road. St Frideswydes C of E Church, formerly on Water Street, was demolished in 2012 and merged with All Saints C of E Church at the north end of Great Crosby.

Thornton also has two historical public houses dating back to the early 19th century called the Nags Head, which is situated opposite Water Street, and the Grapes Hotel.

Thornton has set of stocks located at the junction of Green Lane &amp; Water Street. These, along with the local sundial, can be dated back to the late 18th century and are Grade II listed monuments. There is another Grade II listed monument located in Back Lane called Brooms Cross. This is a wayside cross which lies on what was the old bridleway that ran from Hightown / Ince Blundell to Sefton Parish Church, St. Helens. It was here that funeral processions would come to rest and have refreshments before continuing to the church. Unfortunately this monument, which was restored to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Year of 1977, has become the target of vandals.

The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Parish of Thornton.

<doc id="1115842" wikidata="Q587573" url="?curid=1115842" title="Alexander Gordon Laing">
<text>Major Alexander Gordon Laing (27 December 179426 September 1826) was a Scottish explorer and the first European to reach Timbuktu, arriving there via the north-to-south route in August 1826. He was killed shortly after he departed Timbuktu, some five weeks later.

==Early life==
Laing was born in Edinburgh in late 1794. He was educated by his father, William Laing, who was a private teacher of classics, and at the University of Edinburgh. In 1811, he went to Barbados as clerk to his maternal uncle Colonel Gabriel Gordon.

==Military service==
Through General Sir George Beckwith, the governor of Barbados, he obtained an ensigncy in the York Light Infantry Volunteers in 1813. He was promoted lieutenant without purchase in 1815 and transferred to the 2nd West India Regiment after his former regiment was disbanded in 1817. In 1822 he transferred into the Royal African Colonial Corps as a captain. In that year, while with his regiment at Sierra Leone, he was sent by the governor Sir Charles MacCarthy, to the Mandingo country, with the double object of opening up commerce and endeavouring to abolish the slave trade in that region. Later that year, Laing visited Falaba, the capital of the Solimana country, and ascertained the source of the Rokel. He endeavoured to reach the source of the Niger, but was stopped by the natives. He was, however, able to fix it with approximate accuracy. 

In 1824 he was granted the local rank of major in Africa only. He took an active part in the Ashanti War of 1823-24, and was sent home with the despatches containing the news of the death in action of Sir Charles MacCarthy. While in England in 1824, Laing prepared a narrative of his journeys, which was published in 1825 and entitled &quot;Travels in the Timannee, Kooranko and Soolima Countries, in Western Africa&quot;.

==Trip to Timbuktu==

Laing believed he had found the source of the Niger and proposed to travel along the river to its delta. Joseph Banks, president of the African Association, supported his project, hoping that the expedition would reveal the location of Timbuktu. Henry, 3rd Earl Bathurst, then secretary for the colonies, instructed Captain Laing to undertake a journey, via Tripoli and Timbuktu, to further elucidate the hydrography of the Niger basin. Laing left England in February 1825, and at Tripoli on 14 July he married Emma Warrington, daughter of the British consul. Two days later, leaving his bride behind, he started to cross the Sahara, accompanied by a sheikh who was subsequently accused of planning his murder. Ghadames was reached, by an indirect route, in October 1825, and in December Laing reached In Salah in the Tuat territory, where he was well received by one particular group of Tuareg.

On 10 January 1826, he left Tuat and made for Timbuktu across the desert of Tanezrouft. Letters written in May and July told of his suffering from fever and the plundering of his caravan by another group of Tuareg. Laing describes being wounded in 24 places in the fighting. Together with another survivor, he managed to reach Sidi Al Muktar, penniless and having lost his right hand. He joined another caravan and reached Timbuktu, thus becoming the first modern European to cross the Sahara from north to south. 

His letter dated from Timbuktu on 21 September announced his arrival in that city on the preceding 18 August, and the insecurity of his position owing to the hostility of the Fula chieftain Bello, then ruling the city. He added that he intended leaving Timbuktu in three days&#x27; time. No further news was received from the explorer. From information pieced together later, it was ascertained that he left Timbuktu on the day he had planned. Just after leaving the city, he was murdered by his own Arab escorts.

==Aftermath==

Laing&#x27;s papers were never recovered, and his father-in-law, Hanmer Warrington, accused the French (who also wanted to reach Timbuktu) of interference and having procured Laing&#x27;s journal; however, there has never been any evidence for this. René Caillié reached Timbuktu two years after Laing and by returning alive was able to claim the 9,000-franc prize offered by the Société de Géographie for the feat. Both men were awarded the Gold Medal of the Society for 1830. 

In 1903, the French government placed a tablet bearing Laing&#x27;s name and the date of his visit on the house occupied by him during his 38-day stay in Timbuktu. This house, located in the Djingareiber district, inside the old town, was declared a National Heritage by decree of 18 December 1992.

<text>The black-billed turaco (Tauraco schuettii) is a medium-sized turaco, an endemic family to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a resident breeder in the forests of central Africa, found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, West Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan.

==Description==
The bird is long; ranging in weight from . Adult similar to green turaco, distinguished by small all-black bill and rounded whitish crest. It lays two eggs in a platform of twigs around above the ground. Both the male and female defend a territory and share incubation duties.

Its call is a distinctive feature of the forests of the Congo, a resonant &quot;kwah khaw kwah&quot;. In areas where its range overlaps with the Rwenzori turaco it will aggressively respond to the calls of that species.

It is a widespread species and is not threatened globally (CITES II).

<text>Jean Bureau (c. 1390 – 1463) was a French artillery commander active primarily during the later years of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Along with his brother, Gaspard, he is credited with making French artillery the most effective in the world. As Master Gunner of Artillery in the armies of Charles VII, Bureau acquired a reputation as an effective artillery officer during the Normandy campaign (1449–1450), when his bombardments helped capture the towns of Rouen, Harfleur, and Honfleur, and aided in the French victory at Formigny. Bureau commanded the victorious French army at the decisive Battle of Castillon in 1453.

==Early life and campaigns==

Bureau was born in Semoine, Champagne, the second son of Simon Bureau, a merchant, and his wife, Hélène. In 1420, he moved to Paris to work as a lawyer. He was a legal official at the Châtelet during the occupation of Paris by the Duke of Bedford.

Described as a &quot;perfectionist with a methodical, mathematical mind&quot; and &quot;an imaginative technician who knew how to get the best out of his primitive weapons&quot;, Bureau likely learned the artillery trade for its commercial potential. The Bureau brothers were aided by innovations in the manufacture of gunpowder in the late 1420s that generated a more potent powder that could fire projectiles at a much greater velocity and did not require mixing in the field. Simultaneously, innovations in casting helped create stronger barrels that were less likely to explode.

In 1434, the Bureaus offered their services to Charles VII, and quickly asserted themselves as artillery experts. Jean was appointed &quot;governor of the French archers&quot; and Gaspard was appointed &quot;master of ordnance&quot;, and by 1439, Jean was the Master Gunner of the French Artillery. Jean was also appointed &quot;Receiver of Paris&quot; in 1436, &quot;Treasurer of France&quot; in 1443, and mayor of La Rochelle in 1448.

The Bureaus&#x27; artillery had an immediate impact, aiding the French in the sieges of Montereau (1437), Meaux (1439), Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1440), and Pontoise (1441). The Bureaus helped suppress the Praguerie rebellion against Charles in 1440.

==Later campaigns==

When the Treaty of Tours (which had established a truce between England and France) ended in 1449, Charles VII launched a campaign to retake Normandy in northern France. Bombardments by the Bureaus&#x27; artillery aided in the capture of Rouen (October 1449), Harfleur (December 1449), Honfleur (January 1450), and Fresnoy (January 1450). To ensure a continuous bombardment of English-held Cherbourg, the Bureaus placed their guns below the high water mark on the town&#x27;s seaward side, leaving them submerged during high tide, and returning to resume the bombardment during low tide.

On 15 April 1450, a French force led by the Duke of Bourbon clashed with an English force sent to relieve the beleaguered region at the Battle of Formigny. The French initially attempted to charge the English position, but were driven back by English longbowmen. The Bureaus then advanced two cannons (likely two breechloading culverins), and barraged the English position. The barrage was effective, particularly since the cannons had a greater range than English longbows, but the French failed to provide protection for the cannons, and the English were able to charge and capture them. Cavalry reinforcements arrived later in the day to seal a decisive victory for the French, which paved the way for the capture of the remaining English strongholds in Normandy.

In 1451, the Bureaus joined the French invasion of Gascony, in southwestern France, and were instrumental in the recapture of several cities, including Bordeaux, which surrendered in June. Jean Bureau was appointed Mayor of Bordeaux in August 1451, but the local Gascon population revolted against the new leaders and invited the English to return. In October 1452, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Sir John Talbot, reoccupied Bordeaux with an English force of 3,000. Within a few months, he had regained control of much of the Gascony region.

The French launched their campaign to retake Gascony in the Spring of 1453. Bureau, now leading an army of about 7,000, laid siege to the town of Castillon, east of Bordeaux. He deployed 300 cannon in fortified field defenses on the town&#x27;s perimeter. Remembering the loss of his cannons at Formigny, he attached a force of archers in the woods adjacent to his position to protect the cannons from capture. Talbot arrived with a relief force on 17 July, and routed a small advanced force of French archers. Mistakenly believing the French were retreating, he attacked the French camp, and his army was decimated by Bureau&#x27;s cannon fire. Talbot&#x27;s horse was hit by a cannonball, and he was killed by a French archer shortly after.

Bureau proceeded to Bordeaux, which he surrounded with 250 artillery pieces. After a 10-week siege, Bordeaux sent a delegation to Charles VII asking for terms of surrender. Bureau, confident in the positions of his batteries, told the king, &quot;I promise you on my life that in a few days I shall have demolished the town.&quot; Hearing this statement, the delegation agreed to accept Charles&#x27; harsh terms, and control of the town was turned over to the French on 19 October 1453.

==Later life==

After the war, Bureau was ennobled as the Lord of Montglas. He was knighted in 1461. He and his brother continued to serve as advisors to Charles&#x27; son and successor, Louis XI, even though Louis dismissed most of Charles&#x27; staff. Bureau died in 1463.

<text>The RDS-1 (), also known as Izdeliye 501 (device 501) and First Lightning (), was the nuclear bomb used in the Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear weapon test. The United States assigned it the code-name Joe-1, in reference to Joseph Stalin. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 at 7:00 a.m., at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakh SSR, after top-secret research and development as part of the Soviet atomic bomb project.

==Etymology==

There are several explanations for the Soviet code-name of RDS-1, usually an arbitrary designation: a backronym &quot;Special Jet Engine&quot; (, &quot;Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Spetsialnyi&quot;), or &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Jet Engine&quot; (, &quot;Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Stalina&quot;), or &quot;Russia does it herself&quot; (, &quot;Rossiya Delayet Sama&quot;). Later weapons were also designated RDS but with different model numbers.

== Description ==
The weapon was designed at the Kurchatov Institute, then at the time officially known as &quot;Laboratory № 2&quot; but designated as the &quot;office&quot; or &quot;base&quot; in internal documents, starting in April 1946. Plutonium for the bomb was produced at the industrial complex Chelyabinsk-40.

The RDS-1 explosive yield was 22 kilotons TNT equivalent, similar to the US Gadget and Fat Man bombs. At Lavrentiy Beria&#x27;s insistence, the RDS-1 bomb was designed as an implosion type weapon, similar to the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan; RDS-1 also had a solid plutonium core. The bomb designers had developed a more sophisticated design (tested later as RDS-2) but rejected it because of the known reliability of the Fat Man type design, the Soviets having received extensive intelligence on the design of the Fat Man bomb during World War II, which was discovered in the espionage case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and during the Venona project.

To test the effects of the new weapon, workers constructed houses made of wood and bricks, along with a bridge, and a simulated metro railway in the vicinity of the test site. Armoured hardware and approximately 50 aircraft were also brought to the testing grounds as well as over 1,500 animals to test the bomb&#x27;s effects on life. In a sector of artillery about 100 guns and mortars were placed at distances ranging from 250 to 1,800 meters from ground zero. At distances 500 to 550 meters from ground zero artillery pieces were either totally destroyed or needed factory repair. The resulting data showed the RDS explosion to be 50% more destructive than originally estimated by its engineers.

Mikhail Pervukhin served as the chairman of the commission in charge of the RDS-1 testing.

Five RDS-1 weapons were completed as a pilot series by March 1950 with serial production of the weapon beginning in December 1951.

== Detection by the West ==
Some United States Air Force WB-29 weather reconnaissance aircraft were fitted with special filters to collect atmospheric radioactive debris. On 3 September 1949, the Air Force Office of Atomic Energy had a WB-29 fly from Misawa Air Base in Japan to Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The plane collected some debris during this flight. This data was then cross-checked with data from later flights, and it was determined that the Soviet Union had effectively tested a nuclear weapon.

== Response in the West ==
The test surprised the Western powers. American intelligence had estimated that the Soviets would not produce an atomic weapon until 1953, while the British did not expect it until 1954. When the nuclear fission products from the test were detected by the U.S. Air Force, the United States began to follow the trail of the nuclear fallout debris. President Harry S. Truman notified the world of the situation on 23 September 1949: &quot;We have evidence that within recent weeks an atomic explosion occurred in the U.S.S.R.&quot; Truman&#x27;s statement likely in turn surprised the Soviets, who had hoped to keep the test a secret to avoid encouraging the Americans to increase their atomic programs, and did not know that the United States had built a test-detection system using the WB-29 Superfortress. The announcement was a turning point in the Cold War, that had just begun. Once the Soviet Union was confirmed to be in possession of the atomic bomb, pressure mounted to develop the first hydrogen bomb.

<text>Magnus Sigurdsson ( – 12 November 1139), also known as Magnus the Blind and Magnus IV, was King of Norway from 1130 to 1135 and again from 1137 to 1139. His period as king marked the beginning of the civil war era in Norway, which lasted until 1240.

==Biography==
Magnus was the son of King Sigurd I of Norway and Borghild Olavsdotter. When King Sigurd died in 1130, Magnus became king of Norway together with his uncle Harald Gille. After four years of uneasy peace, Magnus began to openly prepare for war on Harald. On August 9, 1134, he defeated Harald in the decisive Battle at Färlev near Färlev in Stångenäs herred in Båhuslen. Harald fled to Denmark.

Against the advice of his councilors, Magnus disbanded his army and traveled to Bergen to spend the winter there. Harald then returned to Norway with a new army and the support of the Danish King Erik Emune. Meeting little opposition, he reached Bergen before Christmas. Magnus had few men, and the city fell easily to Harald&#x27;s army on January 7, 1135. Magnus was captured and dethroned. He was blinded, castrated and had one leg cut off. After this he was known as Magnus the Blind (&quot;Magnus Sigurdsson den blinde&quot;).

Magnus was put in Nidarholm Abbey on the island of Munkholmen in Trondheim Fjord, where he spent some time as a monk. Harald Gille was killed in 1136 by Sigurd Slembe, another royal pretender who had himself proclaimed king in 1135. To back his claim, Sigurd Slembe brought Magnus back from the abbey and made him co-king. They decided to split up their forces, and Magnus headed for eastern Norway, where he had most popular support. There, he was defeated at the Battle of Minne by the forces of King Inge I. He then fled to Götaland and subsequently to Denmark, where he tried to get support for his cause. An attempted invasion of Norway by King Erik Emune of Denmark failed miserably.

Magnus then rejoined Sigurd Slembe&#x27;s men, but they continued to have little support in Norway. After some time spent more like bandits than kings, they met the forces of King Inge I and King Sigurd II in a final battle on November 12, 1139. Magnus fell during the naval Battle of Holmengrå south of Hvaler in the Oslofjord. The loyal guard Reidar Grjotgardsson lifted his king at the final battle, but a spear impales them both. Magnus was buried in the Church of St. Hallvard in Oslo. There is a monument erected in memory of King Magnus the Blind at the Storedal farm in Skjeberg in Østfold county.

==Norwegian civil war==
During the civil wars period of Norwegian history (1130–1240) there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between church and king. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of king from the contesting party. ((Baglers and Birkebeiners did not exist before until about 30 years later, so this entry is not relevant to the subject matter, as it was a completely different war, in the same historical series of conflicts))

<doc id="1115859" wikidata="Q932544" url="?curid=1115859" title="List of Armenian monarchs">
<text>This is a list of the monarchs of Armenia, rulers of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia (336 BC – AD 428), the medieval Kingdom of Armenia (884–1045), various lesser Armenian kingdoms (908–1170), and finally the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (1198–1375). The list also includes prominent vassal princes and lords who ruled during times without an Armenian kingdom, as well as later claimants to the position.

== Ancient Armenia (521 BC – AD 428) ==
=== Early satraps (521–401 BC) ===

* Hydarnes I, satrap in the late 6th century BC?, granted Armenia by the Achaemenid king Darius I as a semi-hereditary satrapy

* Hydarnes III, satrap in the middle of the 5th century BC 
* Terituchmes, satrap in the second half of the 5th century BC 

=== Orontid dynasty (401–200 BC) ===

=== Artaxiad dynasty (200 BC–AD 2) ===

=== Non-dynastic rulers (2–61) ===

The first century AD was a time of intense conflict between the Roman and Parthian empires. In Armenia, this resulted in rapid appointments and depositions of Armenian client kings by both sides.

* Ariobarzanes, 2–4, a Median prince and matrilineal descendant of Tigranes II
* Artavasdes IV, 4–6, son of Ariobarzanes
* Tigranes V, 6–12, a Herodian prince

* Artaxias III, 18–34, a Pontic prince
* Arsaces (&quot;Arshak I&quot;), 34–35, son of the Parthian king Artabanus II 
* Mithridates (first reign), 35–37, brother of the Iberian king Pharasmanes I 
* Orodes, 37–41, son of the Parthian king Artabanus II 
* Mithridates (second reign), 41–52 
* Rhadamistus, 52–54, son of the Iberian king Pharasmanes I
* Tiridates I (first reign), 54–58, son of the Parthian king Vonones II
* Tigranes VI, 51–61/62, nephew of Tigranes V

=== Arsacid dynasty (61–428) ===

* Tiridates I (second reign), c. 61/66–c. 75/88
* Sanatruk, c. 75/88–c. 110, son of Tiridates I?
* Axidares, c. 110–c. 112, son of the Parthian king Pacorus II
* Parthamasiris, c. 112–c. 114, son of the Parthian king Pacorus II
** &quot;Interregnum&quot; 114–117: Armenia is temporarily incorporated as a province of the Roman Empire
* Vologases I, 117–144, son of Sanatruk
* Sohaemus (first reign), 144–160, a Roman consul with Arsacid and Achaemenid heritage
* Aurelius Pacorus, 160–163, son of the Parthian king Vologases IV
* Sohaemus (second reign), 164–c. 180
* Vologases II, c. 180–190, son of the Parthian king Vologases IV, later ruled Parthia (as Vologases V) 190–208
* Khosrov I, c. 190–214/216, son of Vologases II
* Tiridates II, 217–252, son of Khosrov I
* Hormizd-Ardashir, 252/253– c. 270, son of the Sasanian king Shapur I; made king of Armenia by his father after the Sasanians conquered the kingdom, later king of the Sasanian Empire (as Hormizd I)
* Narseh, c. 270–293, brother of Hormizd-Ardashir, later king of the Sasanian Empire
* Khosrov II, 279/280–287 (in western Armenia), son of Tiridates II?, enthroned by the Romans after Narseh ceded parts of western Armenia to Emperor Probus
*Tiridates (III), 287–298, brother of Khosrov II, initially king of only western Armenia but later granted the rest of the kingdom after Narseh became king of the Sasanian Empire
*Tiridates III (or IV) &quot;the Great&quot;, 298–330, son of Khosrov II
*Khosrov III &quot;the Small&quot;, 330–338, son of Tiridates III
** Sanesan, a Sasanian-backed usurper belonging to the Arsacid dynasty, held much of Armenia for about a year in circa 336.
** Hannibalianus, son of Roman emperor Constantine I, was nominated by the Romans as king of Armenia in 335/336 but died in 337 without Khosrov III having been displaced.
*Tiran (&quot;Tigranes VII&quot;), 338–350, son of Khosrov III
*Arshak II, 350–368, son of Tiran
*Pap, 368–374, son of Arshak II
* Varazdat, 374–378, nephew of Pap (perhaps son of Pap&#x27;s younger brother, Tiridates)
* Arshak III, c. 378–387 and Vologases III, c. 378–386, sons of Pap

In 384, the Sasanian Empire appointed Khosrov IV as Armenian king, in opposition to the Roman-supported Arshak III. This resulted in Armenia becoming informally divided under the two kings. In 387, the division was made formal through an agreement between the Roman emperor Theodosius I and Sasanian king Shapur III. The agreement saw Armenia be partitioned into a western (under Roman influence) and an eastern (under Sasanian influence) kingdom.

==== Western Armenia (387–389) ====

* Arshak III, 387–c. 389, former king of all of Armenia

Upon the death of Arshak III in 389, Emperor Theodosius I chose to not appoint another king, ending the western kingdom. Arshak&#x27;s lands were instead incorporated into the Roman Empire.

==== Eastern Armenia (384–428) ====

* Khosrov IV, 384–389, son of Varazdat?
* Vramshapuh, 389/401–417, son of Varazdat?
* Khosrov V, 417–418, possibly the same person as Khosrov IV
* Shapur, 418–422, son of the Sasanian king Yazdegerd I, later king of the Sasanian Empire (as Shapur IV)
* Artaxias IV, 422–428, son of Vramshapuh

In 428, the Sasanian king Bahram V deposed Artaxias IV, with the permission of the Armenian nobility, and annexed his lands into the Sasanian Empire.

== Vassal lords and princes (428–884) ==

=== &quot;Marzbāns&quot; in Sasanian Armenia (428–646) ===
The Sasanian-ruled Armenian territories were after 428 placed under the rule of an official with the title &quot;marzbān&quot; (governor-general or viceroy). The first &quot;marzbān&quot;, appointed by Bahram V, was the military officer Veh Mihr Shapur.

The list of &quot;marzbān&quot;s is not entirely contiguous. This is due to gaps in the historical record as well as there having been periods without any appointed &quot;marzbān&quot;s. It was relatively common for the office to be vacant since the Sasanian Empire periodically tried to assert more direct control.

* Veh Mihr Shapur, &quot;marzbān&quot; 428–442, Sasanian military officer
* Vasak Siwni, &quot;marzbān&quot; c. 442–451, Armenian noble
* Sahak II Bagratuni, insurgent &quot;marzbān&quot; 482–483, Armenian noble
* Vahan I Mamikonian, autonomous &quot;marzbān&quot; 485–505/510, Armenian noble
* Vard Mamikonian, autonomous &quot;marzbān&quot; 505/510–509/514, Armenian noble
* Mjej I Gnuni, &quot;marzbān&quot; 518–548, Armenian noble
* Philip Siwni, &quot;marzbān&quot; 574–576, Armenian noble
* Mushegh II Mamikonian, &quot;marzbān&quot; 591?, Armenian noble
* Varaztirots II Bagratuni, &quot;marzbān&quot; 628 – after 631, Armenian noble

=== Presiding princes of Armenia (628–884) ===

In the sixth century, the Byzantine Empire established the position of presiding prince of Armenia (formally &quot;prince of the Armenians&quot;). This office was created in an attempt to legitimize a local vassal leader with Byzantine backing and counteract Sasanian efforts in the region. During later centuries, the princes often wavered in allegiance between Byzantium and the Islamic Caliphates, who competed over influence in the region. The princes were most often autonomous tributary vassals. The earliest known presiding prince of Armenia is Mjej II Gnuni, appointed by the Byzantines in the early seventh century.

* Mjej II Gnuni, 628–635 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* David Saharuni, 635–638 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Theodore Rshtuni (first time), 638–c. 645 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Varaztirots II Bagratuni, c. 645 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Theodore Rshtuni (second time), 645–653 (for the Byzantine Empire), 653–655 (for the Rashidun Caliphate)
* Mushegh IV Mamikonian, 654 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Hamazasp Mamikonian, 655–657 (for the Rashidun Caliphate), 657–658 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Grigor I Mamikonian, 662–684/685 (for the Umayyad Caliphate)
* Ashot II Bagratuni, 686–689/690 (for the Umayyad Caliphate)
* Nerseh Kamsarakan, 689/690–691 (for the Byzantine Empire)
* Smbat VI Bagratuni, 691–697; 700–711 (for the Byzantine Empire), 697–700 (for the Umayyad Caliphate)
* Ashot III Bagratuni &quot;the Blind&quot;, 732–748 (for the Umayyad Caliphate)
* Grigor II Mamikonian, 748–750 (for the Umayyad Caliphate)
* Mushegh VI Mamikonian, c. 750; head of insurgent members of the nobility
* Sahak III Bagratuni, c. 755–761 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Smbat VII Bagratuni, 761–772 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Tatzates Andzevatsi, 780–782/785 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Ashot IV Bagratuni &quot;the Carnivorous&quot;, 806–826 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Smbat VIII Bagratuni &quot;the Confessor&quot;, 826–855 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Bagrat II Bagratuni, &quot;Prince of Princes&quot; 830–852 (for the Abbasid Caliphate)
* Ashot V Bagratuni &quot;the Great&quot;, 856–884 (for the Abbasid Caliphate); &quot;Prince of Princes&quot; in 856 and king in 884

== Restored kingdom (884–1045) ==

=== Bagratuni dynasty (884–1045) ===
After more than four centuries of dormancy, the Armenian kingdom was restored under the Bagratuni dynasty, from which several presiding princes had hailed. The Abbasid caliphs were prominent supporters of the Bagratuni princes gaining power over other Armenian nobles due to fears of Byzantine influence in the region. In 884, Prince Ashot V Bagratuni was crowned king (as Ashot I) by his peers. Ashot&#x27;s new position was recognised by both the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate; Emperor Basil I and Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tamid each sent him a royal crown.

* Ashot I &quot;the Great&quot;, 884–890, previously prince
* Smbat I &quot;the Martyr&quot;, 890–913, son of Ashot I
* Ashot II &quot;the Iron&quot;, 914–928, son of Smbat I
** Ashot of Bagaran, c. 915–920; usurper installed by Yusuf Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj
* Abas I, 928–953, son of Smbat I
* Ashot III &quot;the Merciful&quot;, 953–977, son of Abas I
* Smbat II &quot;the Conqueror&quot;, 977–989, son of Ashot III
* Gagik I, 989–1017/1020, son of Ashot III
* Hovhannes-Smbat III, 1017/1020–1040/1041 (in Ani), son of Gagik I
* Ashot IV &quot;the Valiant&quot;, 1017/1020–1040/1041 (in Talin), son of Gagik I
* Gagik II, 1042–1045, son of Ashot IV

The Bagratid kingdom and its capital of Ani was conquered by the Byzantine Empire under Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos in 1045.

=== Lesser medieval Armenian kingdoms ===

==== Vaspurakan, Artsruni dynasty (908–1021) ====

The Artsruni family ruled in Vaspurakan as princes under the Bagratuni kings. The Artsruni family revolted after King Smbat ceded some of the Artsruni lands to the nearby princes of Syunik. Shortly thereafter, in 908, Vaspurakan became a separate kingdom with Gagik Artsruni&#x27;s recognition as a king by Abbasid caliph.

* Gagik Artsruni, 908–937/943
* Derenik-Ashot Artsruni, 937/943–953, son of Gagik
* Abusahl-Hamazasp Artsruni, 953–969/972, son of Gagik
* Ashot-Sahak Artsruni, 969/972–991, son of Abusahl-Hamazasp
* Gurgen-Khachik Artsruni, 991–1003, son of Abusahl-Hamazasp
* Senekerim-Hovhannes Artsruni, 1003–1021, son of Abusahl-Hamazasp

Senekerim-Hovhannes, the last king of Vaspurakan, surrendered his crown to the Byzantine Empire in 1021 under pressure from incursions by the Seljuk Turks and resettled with his family in Cappadocia.

==== Vanand, Bagratuni dynasty (961–1065) ====
The Kingdom of Vanand was created as a vassal state by the Bagratuni kings in 961, ruled by members of their own dynasty.

* Mushegh, 961/962–984, son of Abas I of Armenia
* Abas I, 984–1029, son of Mushegh
* Gagik-Abas II, 1029–1065, son of Abas I; claimed the position of king of all Armenia after the collapse of the main Bagratid kingdom in 1045.

Vanand was ceded to the Byzantine Empire by Gagik-Abas II in 1065.

==== Tashir-Dzoraget, Kiurikian dynasty (982–c. 1145) ====
The Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget was a vassal kingdom founded in 982 by Kiuriki I, youngest son of Ashot III of Armenia, and was thereafter ruled by his descendants. It was for most of its history ruled from the fortress of Lori.

* Kiurike I, 982–989, son of Ashot III of Armenia
* David I &quot;the Landless&quot;, 989–1046/1048, son of Kiurike I
* Kiurike II, 1046/1048–1081/1089, son of David I
* David II and Abas, c. 1089–c. 1145, sons of Kiurike II

Tashir-Dzoraget was largely conquered by the Seljuk Turks in 1081/1089. In the early 12th century, further conquests led to David II and Abas only retaining control of the fortress of Macnaberd. The kingdom was fully conquered by around 1145, though it is possible that some members of the Kiurikian dynasty retained control of fortresses and settlements in the region thereafter.

==== Syunik, Siunia dynasty (970–1170) ====

The independent Kingdom of Syunik was established under the Siuni prince Smbat Sahak in 970.

* Smbat I Sahak, 970–998
* Vasak, 998–1019, son of Smbat I
* Smbat II, 1019–1044, cousin and nephew of Vasak
* Grigor I, 1044–1084, brother of Smbat II
* Senekerim Sevadian, 1084–1094, adoptive son of Grigor I
* Grigor II, 1094–1166, son of Senekerim
* Hasan of Gerakar, 1166–1170, son-in-law of Grigor II

The Kingdom of Syunik was conquered by the Seljuk Turks in 1170.

== &quot;Shah-i Armen&quot;s (1100–1185; 1420–1437) ==
=== Ahlat &quot;Shah-i Armen&quot;s (1100–1185) ===

In the decades following the Battle of Manzikert (1071), one of the Turkmen vassal dynasties of the Seljuk Turks gained control of Ahlat, in the former Armenian heartland. These Muslim &quot;emirs&quot; took the title &quot;Shah-i Armen&quot; (&quot;King of the Armenians&quot;); the same title Islamic sources had previously used for the Bagratuni kings.

* Sökmen I, 1100–1111
* Zahireddin Ibrahim, 1111–1127
* Ahmed, 1127
* Sökmen II, 1128–1185

Sökmen II left no heirs, his death in 1185 terminating the &quot;Shah-i Armen&quot; dynastic line. Ahlat was thereafter ruled by a series of slave &quot;emirs&quot;;&quot;&quot; Seyfeddin Bektimur 1185–1193, Bedreddin Aksungur 1193–1198, Sücaeddin Kutlug 1198, Melukülmansur Muhammed 1198–1207, and Izzeddin Balaban 1207. The city&#x27;s period of relative autonomy came to an end when it was captured by the Ayyubid Sultanate in 1207.

=== Qara Qoyunlu (1420–1437) ===

The title &quot;Shah-i Armen&quot; was temporarily revived in the 15th century under the rule of the Turkmen Qara Qoyunlu, being used by Sultan Qara Iskander as part of his policy to cultivate the Armenian population.

* Qara Iskander, 1420–1437

== Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (1080–1375) ==

The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was a state formed in the Middle Ages by Armenians who fled the Seljuk invasion of their homeland. It was initially ruled by the Rubenids, an offshoot of the Bagratuni dynasty. While the Rubenid rulers were initially regional princes, their close ties with the Western world after the First Crusade saw the principality recognised as a kingdom under Leo I by the Holy Roman Empire in 1198. The rulers of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilia thereafter styled themselves simply as &quot;King of Armenia&quot;.

=== Rubenid dynasty (1080–1252) ===

* Ruben I, prince 1080–1095
* Constantine I, prince 1095–1099, son of Ruben I
* Thoros I, prince 1100–1129, son of Constantine I
* Leo I, prince 1129–1138, son of Constantine I
** &quot;Interregnum&quot; 1138–1145: Cilicia was occupied by the Byzantine Empire
* Thoros II, prince 1145–1169, son of Leo I
* Ruben II, prince 1169–1170, son of Theodore II
* Mleh, prince 1170–1175, son of Leo I
* Ruben III, prince 1175–1186, grandson of Leo I
* Leo I &quot;the Magnificent&quot;, prince (as Leo II) 1186–1198 and king 1198–1219, brother of Ruben III
* Isabella, 1219–1252, daughter of Leo I
* Philip of Antioch, 1222–1224, first husband and co-ruler of Isabella

=== Hethumid dynasty (1226–1341) ===
The Hethumid dynasty gained power through marriage with Isabella of the Rubenid dynasty. Upon her death, her husband Hethum I became sole ruler and he was followed as king by their descendants.

* Hethum I, 1226–1269, second husband of Isabella
* Leo II, 1269–1289, son of Hethum I and Isabella
* Hethum II (first reign), 1289–1293, son of Leo II
* Thoros, 1293–1294, son of Leo II
* Hethum II (second reign), 1294–1296
* Smbat IV, 1296–1298, son of Leo II
* Constantine I, 1298–1299, son of Leo II
* Hethum II (third reign), 1299–1305
* Leo III, 1305–1308, son of Thoros
* Oshin, 1308–1320, son of Leo II
* Leo IV, 1320–1341, son of Oshin

=== Lusignan and Neghir dynasties (1342–1375) ===
After the death of Leo IV in 1341, Leo&#x27;s cousin Guy de Lusignan was elected to succeed him as Constantine II, beginning the rule of the Lusignan dynasty. This dynasty ruled for just over three decades before Cilicia was captured by the Mamluks, bringing an end to the kingdom.

* Constantine II, 1342–1344, cousin and chosen successor of Leo IV (House of Lusignan)
* Constantine III, 1344–1363, elected by the Armenian nobility; grandnephew of Hethum I (House of Neghir)
* Leo (V) &quot;the Usurper&quot;, 1363–1365, unknown lineage; seized the throne and then abdicated after a reign of two years
* Constantine IV, 1365–1373, cousin of Constantine III (House of Neghir)
** Peter de Lusignan, King of Cyprus, was invited to become king by some Armenian barons in 1368 but died in 1369 while making preparations to cross the sea to Cilicia with his forces
* Marie of Korikos, regent 1373–1374, widow of Constantine III and Constantine IV; served as regent while delegations were sent to negotiate with prospective new candidates for the kingship
* Leo V (or VI), 1374–1375, nephew of Constantine II (House of Lusignan)

== Later claimants ==

=== Lusignan claimants (1375–1489) ===
Leo V continued to claim the title &quot;King of Armenia&quot; in exile until his death in 1393. Leo&#x27;s claims were then inherited by James I, his cousin (both were great-grandsons of the Cypriot king Hugh III) who ruled as King of Cyprus. From 1393 to the end of the Cypriot kingdom in 1489, the rulers of Cyprus claimed the full title &quot;King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia&quot;.

* Leo V, 1375–1393, former king of Armenia
* James I of Cyprus, 1393–1398, distant cousin of Leo V
* Janus of Cyprus, 1398–1432, son of James I
* John II of Cyprus, 1432–1458, son of Janus
* Charlotte of Cyprus, 1458–1464, daughter of John II
* James II of Cyprus, 1464–1473, son of John II
* James III of Cyprus, 1473–1474, son of James II
* Catherine Cornaro, 1474–1489, widow of James II and mother of James III

After the fall of the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1489, Catherine Cornaro sold her claims and titles (including her claim to Armenia) to the Republic of Venice, which at times thereafter advanced a shadowy claim to Cilicia or Armenia as a whole.

=== Savoyard claimants (1485–1946) ===

Charlotte, who ruled as Queen of Cyprus 1458–1464, was deposed in 1464 but maintained claims to her titles in exile. In 1485, she ceded all her titular claims to her first cousin once removed, Charles I, Duke of Savoy. As a consequence of Charlotte&#x27;s sale, the House of Savoy is often seen as the heirs of the Lusignan kings of Cyprus and Armenian Cilicia. For centuries thereafter, the heads of the family maintained the style &quot;Duke of Savoy and titular King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia&quot;. 

The title &quot;King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia&quot; was maintained even after the Savoyard dynasts became kings of Italy, for instance being used by both Victor Emmanuel II and Victor Emmanuel III.

* Charlotte of Cyprus, 1464–1485, former queen of Cyprus
* Charles I, Duke of Savoy, 1485–1490, first cousin once removed of Charlotte, ceded titles
* Charles II, Duke of Savoy, 1490–1496, son of Charles I
* Philip II, Duke of Savoy, 1496–1497, uncle of Charles I
* Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, 1497–1504, son of Philip II
* Charles III, Duke of Savoy, 1504–1553, son of Philip II
* Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, 1553–1580, son of Charles III
* Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, 1580–1630, son of Emmanuel Philibert
* Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, 1630–1637, son of Charles Emmanuel I
* Francis Hyacinth, Duke of Savoy, 1637–1638, son of Victor Amadeus I
* Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, 1638–1675, son of Victor Amadeus I
* Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, 1675–1730, son of Charles Emmanuel II
* Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, 1730–1773, son of Victor Amadeus II
* Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia, 1773–1796, son of Charles Emmanuel III
* Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, 1796–1802, son of Victor Amadeus III
* Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia, 1802–1821, son of Victor Amadeus III
* Charles Felix of Sardinia, 1821–1831, son of Victor Amadeus III
* Charles Albert of Sardinia, 1831–1849, great-great-grandson of Victor Amadeus I
* Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, 1849–1878, son of Charles Albert
* Umberto I of Italy, 1878–1900, son of Victor Emmanuel II
* Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, 1900–1946, son of Umberto I
* Umberto II of Italy, 1946, son of Victor Emmanuel III

<text>Henry Edward Colley (21 February 1891 – 18 January 1972) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North-East constituency from 1944 to 1957. He was also a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1957 to 1961.

==Early life and revolutionary period==
He joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, serving in the GPO garrison during the 1916 Easter Rising; British troops, believing him dead, used his body as a sandbag on their Gloucester Street barricade. He was imprisoned at Frongoch internment camp, and was released in December 1916; becoming second-in-command to Oscar Traynor in F Company, 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade IRA. Colley served as Brigade Adjutant, Dublin Brigade IRA in 1920-1921 period was prominent in the attack on The Custom House on 25 May 1921. Opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he took the anti-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War and was involved in the planning and organnising of IRA operations against National forces. He was arrested by National forces on 09 August 1922, interned at Newbridge, County Kildare, where he went on hunger strike and was released in March 1923. Colley later applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and was awarded 12 and 1/18 years service in 1937 at Grade C for his service with the Irish Volunteers and the IRA between 1 April 1916 and 30 September 1923. 

== Politics==
A founder member of Fianna Fáil, he was a leading member of its national executive and its organising committee. Colley was first elected to Dáil Éireann on his second attempt, at the 1944 general election, representing Dublin North-East. He remained a TD until he lost his seat at the 1957 general election, to the future Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Colley was elected to Seanad Éireann for the Labour Panel in 1957. He did not contest the 1961 Seanad election.

He married Christina Nugent on 14 October 1918, and they had five daughters and two sons. One of his sons, George Colley, was elected to the Dáil for the same constituency at the 1961 general election and went on to hold several cabinet positions, including those of Minister for Finance and Tánaiste. He was defeated in the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election, by the man who unseated his father, Charles Haughey.

Harry Colley died on 18 January 1972 and was buried with full military honours in the republican plot at Glasnevin Cemetery.

<text>Under the Whyte notation, a 2-8-4 is a steam locomotive that has two unpowered leading wheels, followed by eight coupled and powered driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. This locomotive type is most often referred to as a Berkshire, though the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway used the name Kanawha for their 2-8-4s. In Europe, this wheel arrangement was mostly seen in mainline passenger express locomotives and, in certain countries, in tank locomotives.
==Overview==
In the United States of America, the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement was a further development of the enormously successful 2-8-2 Mikado. It resulted from the requirement for a freight locomotive with even greater steam heating capacity. To produce more steam, a solution was to increase the size of the locomotive&#x27;s firebox, though the 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with its single axle trailing truck, limited the permissible increased axle loading from a larger firebox. The most practical solution was to add a second trailing axle to spread the increased weight of a larger firebox.

The first American 2-8-4s were built for the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1925 by Lima Locomotive Works. The railroad&#x27;s route across the Berkshire mountains was a substantial test for the new locomotives and, as a result, the name &quot;Berkshire&quot; was adopted for the locomotive type.

In Europe, 2-8-4 tender locomotives were designed mainly for passenger express trains, but they also hauled long-distance express freights to increase utilisation. European 2-8-4 tank locomotives were a logical transition from the 2-8-2T locomotive types, allowing larger fireboxes and larger coal bunkers. They were mainly used for busy suburban services in heavily populated suburban areas of big cities, but infrequently also for sparsely populated rural areas or long-distance lines.

==Usage==

===Australia===

The Western Australian K-class was a class of 2-8-4T steam locomotives of the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR). Between 1893 and 1898, the WAGR took delivery of 24 of these locomotives from Neilson and Company. They entered service on the Eastern Railway between Midland Junction and Northam. In 1900, during the Second Boer War, the Imperial Military Railways experienced a shortage of locomotives and six more new K class locomotives destined for the WAGR were diverted to South Africa, where they were known as the &quot;Western Australians&quot;.

The South Australian Railways also operated 2-8-4s. Fleet construction commenced in 1930 and by the end of 1943, seventeen locomotives were in service on the gauge system. The design of these locomotives was based on American practices. After they were withdrawn from service by 1958, they were all scrapped.

===Austria===
The heavy Class 214 1’D2′ (2–8–4) two-cylinder simple expansion express passenger locomotive was developed in Austria in 1927. It was designed by engineers of the Floridsdorf Werke and was the largest Austrian steam locomotive and the most powerful Berkshire type to run in Europe. Designed for the West railway express train service, they were to be used to haul 580-ton express trains from Wien Westbahnhof in Vienna over to Salzburg. This mainline has three approximately banks with gradients between 1 in 91 and 1 in 125.

Two prototypes were built, a two-cylinder and three-cylinder version. When tested, the two-cylinder version proved to be superior to the three-cylinder Class 114 version, and eventually twelve more two-cylinder Class 214 locomotives were built. In 1936, No. 214.13 reached a speed of , the highest speed ever attained by an Austrian steam locomotive. The regular speed limit was .
From 1938, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) designated the locomotive class 12.0. In the mid-1939, they hauled 600 tons express trains out of Vienna over Wienerwald at a speed of , reaching over level stretches.

In 1945, seven of these locomotives were taken over by the Soviet Military Administration when they occupied the Russian Zone in Austria. These locomotives had &quot;T&quot; (Trofya) painted before their running numbers and were marked &quot;CCCP&quot;. The Russians did not transfer these locomotives out of Austria and, when they withdrew their occupying forces in September 1955, the locomotives were returned to the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB).

When the mainline west of Vienna was electrified, all the ÖBB 1’D2’ locomotives were taken out of service and written off. On 15 February 1962, locomotive No. 12.10, built by Floridsdorf in 1936, was preserved as museum locomotive at the Eisenbahnmuseum Strasshof.

===Brazil===
Beyer Peacock delivered four 2-8-4T locomotives to Minas &amp; Rio Railway (gauge 1000mm) in 1890, and one more in 1894.

The French state-owned sales consortium &quot;Groupement d´Exportation de Locomotives en Sud-Amérique&quot; (GELSA) delivered 66 ultra-modern 2-8-4 two-cylinder simple expansion locomotives for the Brazilian Railways in 1951 and 1952. They were built by &quot;Société Francaise de Construction Mécaniques&quot; (Cail), &quot;Société des Forges et Ateliers de Creusot&quot; (Schneider of Le Creusot) and &quot;Compagnie de Fives-Lille&quot;. All were delivered to Brazil by the end of 1952.

Designed under the direction of engineer André Chapelon, this class demonstrated that large and powerful steam locomotives could run in general use on light rails of with low speed limits. Their maximum axle load had been reduced to 10 tons, all were fitted with double Kylchap exhaust systems and their leading and trailing trucks had Athermos axle boxes. Three tender types could be coupled to them, one heavy and two light, for work in different areas. 
* The heavy tender had six-wheel bogies, a coal capacity of 12 tons and a water capacity of .
* The light coal tender had four-wheel bogies, a coal capacity of 7 tons and a water capacity of .
* The light wood tender had four-wheel bogies, a firewood capacity of and a water capacity of .

These modern locomotives were regarded with suspicion by some enginemen who were used to obsolete British locomotives which were often over forty years old. In addition, diesel locomotive salesmen claimed that steam traction was obsolete. This attitude spread to middle management staff, with the result that these modern French steam locomotives were replaced in the 1960s, when they were hardly run in. Some of those locomotives which worked in Southern Brazil were leased to the Bolivian Railways in the 1960s. By 2004, some still existed as wrecks in a locomotive dump near Santa Cruz in Bolivia.

===Bulgaria===
As part of their modernising and standardisation program, the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) ordered twenty superheated three-cylinder (1’D2’-h3) locomotives from Krupp in 1941. The industrial disruption of the Second World War, however, overloaded the German locomotive builders with domestic production demands and Krupp was only able to produce ten of these new BDZ Class 36 tank locomotives in 1943, works numbers 2272 to 2281.

The new 109.9 ton Class 36 locomotives were intended to replace the older 2-8-0 (1D-h2) locomotives on local passenger train services. The axle loading was kept below 16 tons and their large coal and water capacities made the new class suitable for a wider range of duties, if required. Small smoke deflectors were fitted to the top of the smokebox.

When the new locomotives arrived in Bulgaria in 1943, they were allocated to Sofia depot. Between 1953 and 1957, five locomotives were relocated to Plovdiv depot to serve the Plovdiv-Svilengrad line. In addition to the local passenger train service, duties there also included international express trains to and from Turkey. In 1961, the remaining five locomotives were relocated from Sofia to Varna depot. They remained on these local passenger train duties well into the 1970s, when they were ousted by diesel locomotives and diesel trainsets. Some were preserved.

===Canada===
The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (TH&amp;B) was the only Canadian railway to operate 2-8-4 Berkshires. Only two locomotives were ordered from the Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in 1927, works numbers 67573 and 67574. They were the last new steam locomotives to be ordered by the TH&amp;B and were allocated road numbers 201 and 202. They were fitted with Coffin feedwater heaters and duplex stokers, and had a working order weight of 128 tons.

After being equipped with Automatic Train Control (ATC) in 1929, they were the only TH&amp;B freight locomotives which were allowed to run on New York Central’s tracks, on the Welland-Buffalo line. Due to dieselisation, both were withdrawn from service in June 1953. Both locomotives 201 and 202 were scrapped in late 1953 .

===Czechoslovakia===

====Tank locomotives====
The Czechoslovak State Railways (CSD) was one of the largest tank locomotive users in Europe. The dense railway network in Bohemia and Moravia provided the ideal environment for local short-distance passenger train workings powered by numerous classes of tank locomotives. On 31 December 1937, the CSD had no less than 1,250 tank locomotives on its roster, of which 385 were eight-coupled tank locomotives.

The first Czechoslovakian 1’D2’t-h2 (2–8–4) tank locomotive was derived from the CSD Class 455.1 1’D-h2 (2–8–0) tender locomotive, with water tanks, a coal bunker and a trailing bogie added. Apart from changing the drive from the second to the third coupled axle and increasing the superheating surface of the boiler, these handsome tank locomotives were mechanically identical to the tender locomotives. They were originally intended to be used on the Prague to České Budějovice (Böhmisch Budweis) line and on branch lines diverting from the mainline for local train service. At the time, however, the 16 ton axle load proved to be too high for most of the lines where they were intended to run and for this reason only 27 locomotives were built between 1928 and 1932.

The first thirteen were initially designated Class 446.0, but an increase in their permitted maximum speed to led to the locomotive&#x27;s reclassification to Class 456.0, numbered 456.001 to 027. These were powerful tank locomotives, nicknamed &quot;Krasin&quot; after the explorer General Nobile who reached the North Pole in 1928. When tested while hauling a 900-ton train, one reached a maximum speed of at level and an average speed of while climbing a 1 in 100 gradient.

Between 1938 and 1945, all of them remained on the &quot;Böhmisch-Mährisch Bahn&quot; (BMB) and &quot;Protektorátni Drahy Cech a Moravy&quot; (CMD) lines in Bohemia and Moravia, and all 27 survived the Second World War. By the early 1960s, the Class 456.0 locomotives were spread thinly over most of the country, having been allocated to locations from Plzeň in western Bohemia to Banská Bystrica in Slovakia. All were withdrawn from service between 1968 and 1972. One, no. 456.011, went into industrial service and three others, numbers 456.015, 024 and 026, were later used as mobile boilers. The remainder were scrapped.

====Tender locomotives====
The CSD ordered three Class 486.1 1’D2’-h3 (2–8–4) locomotives, based on the three-cylinder Class 114 locomotive of the Austrian Federal Railways (BBÖ). This hand-fired locomotive had a Krauss-Helmholtz leading truck and the diameter of its coupled wheels was . Its total weight in working order was 107.6 tons, of which 63.9 tons were adhesive weight. All three cylinders were of bore with a stroke. The heating surface of the boiler was , of which were superheating area. The grate area was and the locomotive was designed for possible coal dust firing. They had Class 926.0 tenders, which were rebuilt from Class 623.0 tenders.

They were not as successful as expected. One of the Class was tested against a Class 486.0 2’D1’-h3 (4-8-2) locomotive on the hilly mainline between Žilina and Košice on the former Košice-Bohumín Drahy (KBD) line. It proved to be inferior to its opponent in both speed and power.

All three locomotives were allocated to the Brno shed for most of their active service lives. During the years from 1938 to 1945, they were rostered as BMB-CMD locomotive stock. They were withdrawn from service in 1967 and 1968 and were later used as mobile boilers.

===Germany===

====Deutsche Bundesbahn====
After the Second World War, the recovering West Germany needed economical assistance. This came, in part, in the form of new locomotive orders placed with the West German locomotive industry, which kept it going in the tough and competitive world markets.
A new tank locomotive type was designed by Krauss-Maffei and, in 1951, the firm built thirteen locomotives of a new Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) Class 65 1’D2’t-h2 (2-8-4T) locomotive. Five more followed in 1955. In test, these locomotives hauled 800 tons on level track, while they managed to reach hauling 400 tons up a 1 in 100 gradient. All the locomotives had small &quot;Witte&quot; type smoke deflectors. Their maximum speed was , even running bunker first.

These locomotives saw service in local passenger train service around big cities and on branch lines which could bear the 17.5 ton axle load. They were found to be economical in service and served well during the short period they spent in service. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were ousted by expanding electrification and by diesel locomotives and diesel motor trainsets.

====Deutsche Reichsbahn====
The East German Deutsche Reichsbahn’s 1’D2’t-h2 (2-8-4T) locomotives were derived from the West German Class 65 and became the Class 65.10. They were capable of developing and could run at on level track, hauling 350 tons passenger trains. A total of 88 Class 65.10 locomotives were built between 1954 and 1957. These locomotives had the DR&#x27;s version of small &quot;Witte&quot; type smoke deflectors.
These were the last new-built 1’D2’t-h2 (2-8-4T) locomotives in the world. Their maximum 17.5 ton axle load restricted them to mainline service. They were intended to haul heavy suburban trains around Berlin, Leipzig, Halle and Magdeburg, where they replaced the older Prussian T 12 and Prussian T 18 classes. Many were still in service in the 1970s and some still survived in the early 1980s.

For branch line service, the DR designed a smaller wheeled version of the Class 65.10. This locomotive had only a 15-ton axle load and became the DR Class 83.10. Its maximum speed in both directions was . These locomotives were also fitted with the DR&#x27;s version of &quot;Witte&quot; smoke deflectors, the only tank locomotive designed for freight service that had them.

In 1955, 27 of these locomotives were built and used for working freight and mixed trains on short branch lines. They also worked on mountainous lines with sharp curves and steep gradients of more than 1.5% (1 in 67) and where was the maximum speed limit.

===Japan===

The Japanese National Railways (JNR) closely followed American practice after the Second World War, with Berkshire locomotives used mainly on heavy freight service, such as heavy coal trains. They were the heaviest steam locomotives used on the JNR&#x27;s gauge lines.

The JNR rebuilt a total of 104 locomotives to the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement from its older 2-8-2 Mikado classes, the Class D50, Class D51 and Class D52.
* In 1950 and 1951, twenty Class D62 2-8-4 locomotives were rebuilt from Class D52 at the JNR&#x27;s Hamamatsu Works.
* Between 1951 and 1956, 78 Class D60 2-8-4 locomotives were rebuilt from Class D50 at the JNR&#x27;s Hamamatsu, Nagano and Tsuchizaki Works.
* In 1959 and 1960, six Class D61 2-8-4 locomotives were rebuilt from Class D51 at the JNR&#x27;s Hamamatsu and Kōriyama Works.

Some of these locomotives survived in service up to the end of steam traction on the JNR in 1974.

===Mexico===
In 1951, Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México&quot; (N de M) bought five 2-8-4 locomotives, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1940, from Norfolk Southern Railway in the United States of America (USA), where they had become redundant due to dieselisation. Before their arrival in Mexico, all five went through a complete major overhaul in the USA. They arrived in Mexico late in 1951 and were allocated N de M numbers 3350 to 3354. Remaining in service until the late 1960s, they became the last USA-built Berkshires in the world to remain in revenue-earning common carrier service.

===New Zealand===
In 1904, the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) ordered a 2-8-4 tank locomotive from Baldwin Locomotive Works for banking duties on the % (1 in 40) gradients from Wellington to Ngaio. The locomotive, no. 3, was nicknamed &quot;Jumbo&quot;. When the New Zealand Government purchased the WMR, no. 3 was renumbered to WJ class no. 466 by the New Zealand Government Railways. It was the only locomotive in the class.

The locomotive had a tendency for cracking its bar frame on this heavy duty. By 1920, it was waiting to go to the Petone Works with yet another crack in the frame and it did not see much service after that. The solitary 2-8-4T locomotive in New Zealand was written off the books in 1928 and its boiler was sent to the Taumarunui locomotive depot for use as a washout boiler.

===Norway===
In the mid-1930s, the Norwegian State Railways (Norges Statsbaner or NSB) ordered altogether eighteen powerful superheated four-cylinder compound 1&#x27;D2&#x27;-h4v (2–8–4) passenger locomotives for express and passenger train service on its single mainline between Oslo and Trondheim, on the northern section between Otta and Trondheim.

The section of the mainline between Trondheim and Dombås reaches an altitude of over the &quot;Dovrefjell&quot;, with gradients of 1 in 46 to 1 in 56 and curves of radius. At the time, the maximum axle load was limited to 15.5 tons. Great skill was displayed in the design of these locomotives, which were built specifically to operate 300 ton trains under these conditions. Weight reduction was a major problem and, as a consequence, the frame was constructed of only plate, but strongly braced, while the platform was of aluminium.
The planned eighteen NSB Class 49 locomotives never materialised, however, since those under construction at the Krupp Works in Essen, Germany, were damaged so severely by Allied bombing in October 1943 that they were never completed. In addition, Thune&#x27;s Works at Skøyen in Norway could not carry on with the construction of its share of the order because of a wartime lack of high quality steel and other materials.

Only seven Class 49 locomotives were eventually placed in service. Of these, three were built by Hamar and Thune in 1935 and 1936, two by Krupp in 1940 and two by Thune in 1941. These locomotives, nicknamed &quot;Dovregubben&quot; (Dovre Giants), were the only true compounds owned by the NSB.

On test, one of them hauled 350 tons at up a gradient of 1 in 55, developing . Despite the relatively small diameter coupled wheels, a speed of was reached with the same load on level track. In normal service, their maximum speed was restricted to on account of the light track in use at the time and they were capable of hauling 280 tons at up long 1 in 55 gradients.

When compared to other NSB steam locomotives, these engines had a short lifespan and all were written off in 1958, after the arrival of class Di3 diesel locomotives on the Dovre line.

===Romania===

When the Romanians looked for a powerful passenger locomotive to serve on the Căile Ferate Române (CFR) mainlines across the Carpathian Mountains, they decided upon the Austrian Federal Railways (BBÖ) Class 214. They purchased the drawings from Austria and 79 locomotives of the same type were built under licence in their modern new Malaxa and Reşiţa Works in Romania. These 2-8-4 locomotives entered service as CFR class 142.000. In 1939, a batch was built with Caprotti instead of Lentz poppet valves, but since some of these were later observed with Lentz valve gear, the Italian gear had presumably been removed.

These locomotives proved to be suitable for Romanian conditions, being of ample dimensions, moderate axle load, straightforward two-cylinder engines of bore with a stroke, and diameter coupled wheels. The total weight in working order was 123.5 tons, of which 72.1 tons was adhesive weight.

Nearly all of them were still in service in the late 1960s. The Class 142 locomotives hauled the principal CFR express trains on mainlines and, like their Austrian cousins, were able to render good performance. At least three have been preserved for museums, locomotives no. 142.008, 142.044 and 142.072.

===South Africa===

In 1900, during the Second Boer War, the Imperial Military Railways experienced a shortage of locomotives and six  tank locomotives, destined for the Western Australian Government Railways, were diverted to South Africa where they were known as the &quot;Western Australians&quot;. In 1902, they came onto the roster of the Central South African Railways and were designated CSAR Class C. By 1912, when the renumbering onto the South African Railways (SAR) roster was implemented, these locomotives were considered obsolete and were not included in the SAR classification and renumbering list, but recommended for scrapping even though they were still less than twelve years old.

In 1949 and 1950, the SAR placed 100 Class 24 Berkshires in branch line service, which included the whole of South West Africa (Namibia). They were acquired to replace the ageing fleet of Class 6 and Class 7 locomotives on light rail.
The locomotive was designed by Dr. M.M. Loubser, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1939 to 1949. It had a one-piece steel main frame that was cast integrally with the cylinders, including the cylinder hind covers, smokebox support frame, stays and various brackets, all of which would normally be separate items riveted or bolted onto the frame. Advantages of this arrangement were reduced maintenance and less time spent in shops. It was the first South African steam locomotive to be built using this technique. They were built with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers and they used Type MY &quot;Torpedo&quot; tenders that ran on three-axle Buckeye bogies.

It was the only Berkshire type to see service on the SAR. Most of them went to South West Africa, where 55 of them would remain in operation until strengthening of the track and the introduction of diesel traction made them available to be employed elsewhere. They were withdrawn in the mid-1980s. Several have been preserved in running order for service on excursion trains, operated by private steam enthusiast groups in Cape Town and in Gauteng.

===Soviet Union===
From the mid-1930s until their replacement by diesel locomotives, the 2-8-4 (1’D2’-h2) wheel arrangement was relatively common in the former Soviet Union. When built, these locomotives were designated Class IS, for Josif Stalin. The Class IS locomotive was a passenger derivative of the Class FD 1’E1’-h2 (2-10-2) freight locomotive and had many parts in common with the Class FD.

The Soviet 2-8-4 was the most numerous single Berkshire class built in the world.
Kolomna Locomotive Works built the first four locomotives. In 1935, production was transferred to the enlarged and modernised former Luhansk Works which was renamed Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Works. A total of 649 locomotives of the two variants, Class IS20 and Class IS21 (later Class FDp), were built between 1932 and 1942. After Germany attacked the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the Russians evacuated all semi-completed class IS21 locomotives from Voroshilovgrad. The Ulan-Ude Locomotive Works completed the last eleven in 1941 and 1942.
Despite their moderate size compared to American and Canadian-built 2-8-4s, the Soviet 2-8-4 was a good example of a Berkshire type designed for heavy express and passenger train service. It had a grate, boiler pressure, boiler heating surface of which was superheated, and only 20 to 21 tons maximum axle load. Their diameter coupled wheels and cylinders of bore and stroke, with a total weight of 133 tonnes of which 80.7 tonnes were adhesive weight, enabled the locomotives to easily reach the maximum permitted speed of with 700 to 800 tons behind the tender. The usual maximum speed was about , with an occasional need of .
They were used as express passenger locomotives on mainlines which had type Ia rails of . They were later reclassified as Class FDp (FD passenger). One locomotive, no. IS20-16, was streamlined and achieved a speed of during test runs in 1937. Another, no. IS20-241, was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition in 1937, where it demonstrated the Soviet Union&#x27;s locomotive production.

The first four were initially allocated to the October Railway and ran between Moscow and Leningrad, hauling heavy night passenger trains. Later, when the line was upgraded with heavier rails, they were transferred to the Moscow-Kursk-Kharkov-Sinelnikovo line. When more class IS locomotives began to roll out from the Voroshilovgrad production lines, they were used on the upgraded Moscow-Smolensk-Minsk, Moscow to Valuiki and Mitchurinsk to Rostov-on-Don mainlines.

Only one such locomotive was preserved, no. IS21-578, plinthed outside the main railway station in Kyiv in Ukraine.

===United States===

Locomotives of a 2-8-4 wheel arrangement were used mainly for hauling fast, heavy freight trains on large Class I railroads, most notably the Nickel Plate Road and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio. While some were ordered to replace older freight locomotives like 2-8-2 Mikados or 2-10-2s where more power and speed was required, later examples were constructed for new fast freight trains, with schedules too fast for older designs.

Six years after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway experimented with the first 2-10-4, the first 2-8-4 was built by Lima Locomotive Works for the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&amp;A) in 1925. The railroad&#x27;s route over the Berkshires in western Massachusetts was one of the only significant grades on the New York Central system, and was thus the ideal field test environment for the new design. Lima had previously designed a &quot;super 2-8-2&quot; for the NYC, but increasing train length and speed demanded increased steam capacity, so an additional axle was added to the trailing truck and the first 2-8-4 in the U.S., Lima A-1 class number 1, was born. This approach to locomotive design was termed &quot;Super-Power&quot; by Lima, a moniker that was subsequently applied to locomotives of similar designs made by other companies (e.g. ALCO and Baldwin).

The A-1 featured driving wheels, a working boiler pressure of , and produced over of tractive effort from cylinders. While not suited to fast freight, the A-1 proved a dramatic improvement over the existing locomotives on the line, hauling a heavier train over the mountain more than an hour faster than a nearly-new 2–8–2. Impressed by the new design, the B&amp;A quickly ordered 45 identical locomotives from Lima, choosing to name the type after the mountains they were designed against. Though the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway called their 2-8-4s by the name &quot;Kanawha&quot;, the name &quot;Berkshire&quot; became synonymous with the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement, and was used by almost every railroad that rostered them.

Lima soon received orders from other railroads, and by 1930 they had built over 200 examples for five different railroads.
ALCO and Baldwin were soon producing examples as well, with almost 300 2-8-4s built by 1930. 
The next development of the Berkshire type came in 1927, when the Erie Railroad ordered 25 engines from ALCO. In contrast to the A-1, these had drivers and cylinders, allowing for much higher speeds and transforming the Erie&#x27;s freight business, which had previously followed the &quot;drag freight&quot; model of low speeds and high tonnage. A total of 105 similar locomotives from all 3 major builders would eventually form the backbone of the Erie&#x27;s freight fleet, the largest fleet of 2-8-4s in the US, and would serve until the railroad dieselized in the 1950s.

The Berkshire&#x27;s final development came in 1934, when the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road or NKP) received its first 2-8-4s, built to a new design from the Advisory Mechanical Committee (AMC) of the Van Sweringen empire. Under the Van Sweringen umbrella were the Nickel Plate Road, Erie Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Pere Marquette Railway. The AMC&#x27;s design, based on the C&amp;O&#x27;s T-1 2-10-4s themselves based on the Erie&#x27;s 2-8-4s generated of tractive effort with drivers and became the basis for many subsequent Berkshire designs. The NKP eventually received 80 of the type; 32 copies were built for the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie, and the Richmond, Fredricksburg, and Potomac received 10 engines built to the same design during World War 2. The Pere Marquette&#x27;s fleet of 39 Berkshires was built to a slightly different design, with marginally larger cylinders and increased weight, which formed the basis for C&amp;O&#x27;s fleet of 90 &quot;Kanawhas&quot; as well as 5 engines built for the Virginian Railway. The final Berkshire design was that of the Louisville &amp; Nashville, whose fleet of 42 locomotives is considered by many to be an evolution of the Van Sweringen design.

The last American 2-8-4 built was also the last steam locomotive built by Lima, Nickel Plate 779, in 1949. Coincidentally, ALCO&#x27;s last steam locomotives were also Berkshire types, built in 1948 for the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad; towards the end of their short service lives they were transferred to the P&amp;LE&#x27;s parent company, the New York Central Railroad. Over 600 2-8-4s were built for American service, constituting 2% of the steam fleet prior to dieselization and delivering 5% of the nation&#x27;s freight ton-miles.

Ultimately rostering 112 locomotives (through its own purchases, and the acquisition of nearly identical locomotives with its purchase of the Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie), the Nickel Plate Road became indelibly associated with the Berkshire type. One of this class, Nickel Plate Road no. 765, was restored to operation and regularly operates excursion trains from its home in New Haven, Indiana. 5 other NKP Berkshires are preserved around the US, including 779 at Lincoln Park in Lima, Ohio.

Another 2–8–4, Pere Marquette 1225, has also been restored to operating condition, and runs regular excursions with the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan. As of April 2024, C&amp;O 2716 was undergoing restoration by the Kentucky Railway Museum. C&amp;O 2755, along with 10 other C&amp;O Kanawha types and Pere Marquette 1223, are preserved on static display around the US. No other 2-8-4s survive, including Lima&#x27;s groundbreaking A-1.

Many American Class I railroads rostered sizeable fleets of Berkshires. The table lists data on the American locomotives as they were built.
==Berkshires in fiction==
In the motion picture &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, the &quot;know-it-all&quot; boy identifies the train&#x27;s locomotive as &quot;a Baldwin 2-8-4 S-3 class&quot; built in 1931, although the actual prototype for the film&#x27;s locomotive was the Pere Marquette 1225, a Berkshire built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1941.

In the &quot;Transformers&quot; television series, motion picture and toy line, the Decepticon triple changer Astrotrain is modeled on a JNR Class D62 2-8-4 locomotive which all of them did not survive the cutters torch and were ultimately scrapped in 1966 and none were saved for posperity.

&quot;Locomon&quot; in the motion picture &quot;Digimon: Runaway Locomon&quot; is a 2-8-4 type locomotive.

<text>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is a registered trade union and professional body in the United Kingdom for those in the profession of nursing. It was founded in 1916 as the College of Nursing, receiving its royal charter in 1928. Queen Elizabeth II was the patron until her death in 2022, King Charles III continued the royal connection and became patron in 2024. The majority of members are registered nurses; however student nurses and healthcare assistants are also members. There is also a category of membership, at a reduced cost, for retired people.

The RCN describes its mission as representing nurses and nursing, promoting excellence in practice and shaping health policies. It has a network of stewards, safety representatives and union learning representatives as well as advice services for members. Services include a main library in London, and regional libraries. The RCN Institute provides courses for nurses.

==History==
The College of Nursing Ltd was founded on 27 March 1916, with 34 members, as a professional organisation for trained nurses. On a proposal from Dame Sarah Swift (then matron of Guy&#x27;s Hospital ) and Arthur Stanley, chairman of the Joint War Organisation, developed with Rachael Cox-Davies (matron of the Royal Free Hospital) and Alicia Lloyd-Still (matron of St. Thomas Hospital ) the College was founded with articles of association. The objectives of the College were 1) to promote better education and training of nurses , 2) to promote uniformity of curriculum, 3) to recognize approved nursing schools, 4) to make and maintain a register of persons who had certificates of proficiency in nursing and 5) promote bills in parliament in support of the interests of the nursing profession. Eleven matrons signed the founding articles of Association , one of whom was Margaret Elwyn Sparshott. It attempted amalgamation with the Royal British Nurses&#x27; Association, but this was frustrated, largely by the efforts of Ethel Gordon Fenwick. In March 1917 the college had 2,553 members and, by 1919, 13,047, a great deal more than the RBNA. It had most of the nursing places on the General Nursing Council when it was first established, and by 1925 it had about 24,000 members. Membership was restricted to registered general nurses. The college initially excluded male nurses, and those on the mental, mental subnormality, fever and children&#x27;s nurses&#x27; registers from membership. Annie Warren Gill was one of the founders of the Scottish board of the College of Nursing which held its first meeting on 1 November 1916 in Edinburgh. She was instrumental in setting up local branches in Scotland to increase membership. Gill also proposed in 1922 that married members be considered part of the College, having realised that there would be a nursing shortage following World War 1. 

A royal charter was granted in 1928.The organisation became the College of Nursing and Frances Goodall its Assistant General Secretary. The college pushed for registered nurses to be given precedence, and to be in charge. In 1935 Frances Goodall became General Secretary and the Trades Union Congress promoted a Parliamentary bill to secure a 48-hour working week for all hospital employees. The college opposed this and was accused by the TUC of being &quot;an organisation of voluntary snobs&quot;. In 1939 the college&#x27;s name was changed to “the Royal College of Nursing”. The Ministry of Health guaranteed a salary of £40 to nursing students in training in 1941, about double what voluntary hospitals were paying before the war. The College said that this was too high. In 1943 the College held nine seats to represent &#x27;employees&#x27; on the Nurses Salaries Committee chaired by Lord Rushcliffe which published two reports in 1943. In 1963, active RCN member Grace Margery Westbrook became the first practising nurse to be elected Chair of the Staff Side Committee, Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council 1963-1969; her RCN activities had included being elected Council member representing Southern England in 1959.

Since 1977 the RCN has been registered as a trade union.

=== 21st century ===
In 2018, after a pay agreement was not clearly explained to the membership, the Chief Executive and General Secretary Janet Davies resigned and Dame Donna Kinnair was appointed in an acting capacity. She was confirmed in the role in April 2019. A motion of no confidence in the RCN Council was called shortly afterwards and passed in September 2018 with 78% of votes, but on a turnout when only 3.7% of the membership voted. As well as the Chief Executive and General Secretary, the Director of Member Relations had previously resigned. Twelve of the 17 council members resigned, 10 of them standing for re-election in the subsequent election.

In 2019, the RCN&#x27;s first strike – limited to Northern Ireland, over staffing and pay issues – took place.

In May 2019, the Royal College of Nursing voted to back the “decriminalisation” of prostitution.

In April 2021, Pat Cullen started acting as General Secretary &amp; Chief Executive, and was appointed as interim General Secretary &amp; Chief Executive in July 2021.

In August 2021, the RCN cancelled its annual meeting of members in Liverpool following allegations of sexual harassment and said the 2021 Congress would now be held virtually in order to safeguard those attending.

In 2022, the RCN held a strike ballot over pay, held separately across NHS trusts and boards. Its members went on strike as part of the 2022–2023 National Health Service strikes. The RCN commented that from 2010 (the start of the government&#x27;s austerity programme) to 2022, pay for nurses had fallen by 20%. The government offered a 5% pay rise to most Agenda for Change classes; the RCN demanded a pay rise of retail price index inflation plus five per cent. Around 60 per cent of NHS workplaces in England reached the turnout necessary to legally strike. Outside of Scotland—where the government began negotiations over its 7.5 per cent offer—strikes took place on 15 December and 20 December 2022. In England, further strikes took place in January and February 2023.

==Offices==
The UK headquarters are at 20 Cavendish Square, London, a Grade II listed building. This also serves as the England HQ and London region offices. 

Additional country headquarters are based in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.

Additional England regional offices are located in Birmingham, Bolton, Bury St Edmunds, Croydon, Exeter, Leeds, Newbury, Nottingham, and Sunderland. 

==Council==

The RCN is governed by its Council. Council members represent members, making decisions that meet the RCN&#x27;s legal and statutory requirements. These include responsibilities as set out in the royal charter and in trade union legislation. 

As at 2024 Council is made up of 17 elected members. 14 of these members are elected directly to the role. 12 are elected by the geographical sections (Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and 9 English regions). One member is elected by student members (RCN Students). One member is elected by Nursing Support Worker members. These 14 members choose 3 Council officers from among themselves for the roles of Chair of Council, Vice Chair of Council and Honorary Treasurer. 

All RCN members elect the final three roles of RCN President, RCN Deputy President,and the Chair of RCN Congress (non-voting). 

The RCN&#x27;s General Secretary is appointed by Council. Council members are not paid to serve on Council but voluntarily give up their time to serve the RCN and its members, in their governance role.

* 2005–2013 Sandra James

* 2013–2018 Michael Brown

==RCN libraries==

The RCN has four physical libraries in London, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh. 

The largest of these is in London, which is also responsible for the online library services. The London library was founded in 1921, and claims to hold Europe&#x27;s largest nursing library resource. 

Due to its Museum holdings, the Library is a member of The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine group. Special collections include the printed Historical Collection and the RCN Steinberg Collection of Nursing Research, the latter of which comprises over 1,000 nursing theses and dissertations 1950s-2010s.

The RCN Archive is physically held in Edinburgh, with increasing online services

==Fellowships==

Fellowships are selectively awarded by the RCN in recognition of exceptional contributions to nursing. Honorary fellowships are granted by the RCN Council to those who are unable to become an RCN member, either because they are from overseas or because they work outside the nursing profession. Only a small number of fellows are elected each year. For example, in 2021, 11 fellows and two honorary fellows were elected, and in 2022, five fellows and three honorary fellows were elected.

Fellows and honorary fellows are entitled to use the postnominal FRCN.

==RCN publications==
As at 2024 the RCN produces an online member publication &quot;RCN Magazine&quot; (formerly &quot;RCN Bulletin&quot;) 

RCNi (previously RCN Publishing) produces &quot;Nursing Standard&quot;, which is available through subscription and on news stands. It also publishes a range of journals for specialist nurses: &quot;Cancer Nursing Practice&quot;, &quot;Emergency Nurse&quot;, &quot;Learning Disability Practice&quot;, &quot;Mental Health Practice&quot;, &quot;Nursing Children and Young People&quot;, &quot;Nursing Management&quot;, &quot;Nursing Older People&quot;, &quot;Nurse Researcher&quot; and &quot;Primary Health Care&quot;.

<text>Kazimierz Bein (1872 – 15 June 1959), often referred to by his pseudonym Kabe, was a Polish ophthalmologist, the founder and sometime director of the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute (&quot;Warszawski Instytut Oftalmiczny&quot;).

He was also, for a time, a prominent Esperanto author, translator and activist, until in 1911 he suddenly, without explanation, abandoned the Esperanto movement. Bein became at least as well known for his involvement with Esperanto as for his medical accomplishments, and as much for the manner in which he left the Esperanto movement as for what he had accomplished within it.

==Life==

As a young man, Bein participated in the Polish movement for independence from Russia, for which he was exiled for several years; thus he was forced to finish his medical training in Kazan. Bein authored many technical books and articles, and founded the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute and the Polish Ophthalmological Society. He was also a noted amateur photographer.

==Esperanto movement==
Bein was among the earliest adopters of Esperanto, the international language that had been created by a fellow Polish ophthalmologist, L. L. Zamenhof. Bein became an eminent pioneer of Esperanto prose, writing under the pseudonym, &quot;Kabe,&quot; an abbreviation of his actual name (and also the Polish pronunciation of his initials, &quot;K.B.&quot;). In 1904 he gained fame with his translation of a 1900 novel by Wacław Sieroszewski, &quot;Dno nędzy&quot; (&quot;The Depths of Misery&quot;; Esperanto title: &quot;Fundo de l&#x27; Mizero&quot;). 

In 1906 Bein became vice-president of the Academy of Esperanto. He had a profound influence on the language&#x27;s early development. The highlights of his career were most likely his Esperanto translation of Bolesław Prus&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Faraono&quot; (&quot;Pharaoh&quot;), and one of the first Esperanto dictionaries, &quot;Vortaro de Esperanto&quot;.

Bein is, however, probably best known for his sudden, comment-less 1911 disappearance from the Esperanto scene. Interviewed twenty years later, in 1931, by the Esperanto magazine, &quot;Literatura Mondo&quot; (World of Literature), he spoke of Esperanto&#x27;s stalled progress, and said that he no longer regarded the language as a viable solution to the need for an international language.

Shortly after he left the movement, Esperantists coined the word &quot;kabei&quot;, after &quot;Kabe,&quot; meaning &quot;to fervently and successfully participate in Esperanto, then suddenly and silently drop out.&quot; The expression, &quot;kabei&quot;, remains in use by Esperantists to this day.

<text>Taron (; &quot;Daron&quot;; , &quot;Tarōn&quot;; ) was a canton of the Turuberan province of Greater Armenia, roughly corresponding to the Muş Province of modern Turkey.

== Early Middle Ages ==
The main source on the principality&#x27;s history during the Early Middle Ages is the &quot;History of Taron&quot;, a relatively short &quot;historical&quot; romance in five parts, purporting to describe significant events occurring in the district of Taron during the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars when the Sassanid emperor was Khosrau II (590-628). During Khosrau&#x27;s reign, Taron was frequently invaded by the Persians. The &quot;History&quot; describes the actions of five generations of Mamikonians (Taron&#x27;s princely house), in defending and avenging the district. Each section or cycle of the story is devoted to the exploits of one of the defenders: Mushegh, Vahan, Smbat, his son Vahan Kamsarakan, and the latter&#x27;s son Tiran. The heroes are at times superhumanly brave or duplicitous, wise or cunning, humble or bombastic, humane or brutally merciless as the situation requires. Above all, they are the holy warriors of St. Karapet (John the Baptist, their patron saint), and they zealously defend the Saint Karapet Monastery (Glakavank) as well as all the churches and Christians in the district. Much of the narration describes battles fought and the cunning tactics used by the Taronites to defeat the invading Iranians.

== Later history ==
With the death of Mushegh VI Mamikonian at the Battle of Bagrevand in April 775, and the eclipse of the Mamikonian from Armenian affairs, and following a conflict with the Jahhafids, Taron passed to Ashot Msaker of the Bagratuni family. His successors ruled Taron until 967:

* Ashot I Msaker (died 826), ca. 813–826, presiding prince of Armenia (as Ashot IV) from 806 
* Bagrat I (died after 851), 826–851, presiding prince of Armenia (as Bagrat II) after 830
* Ashot II (ca. 835 – 878), after 851–878
* David (ca. 840 – 895), 878–895 (brother of Ashot II)
* Gurgen (murdered 895/6), 895/6 (son of Ashot II)
* Taron seized by Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, 895/6–898
* Grigor I (died 923/36), 898–923/936 (cousin of Gurgen)
* Bagrat II (died before 940) and Ashot III (died 967), 898–967

Upon the death of Ashot III in 967, his two sons, Grigor II (Gregory Taronites) and Bagrat III (Pankratios Taronites), ceded the principality to the Byzantine Empire in exchange for lands and noble titles. In Byzantium, probably along with other branches of their family already established there in previous decades, they formed the Taronites family, which was one of the senior Byzantine noble families during the 11th–12th centuries. Under Byzantine rule, Taron was united with the district of Keltzene into a single province (theme), whose governor (&quot;strategos&quot; or &quot;doux&quot;) usually bore the rank of &quot;protospatharios&quot;. In the middle of the 11th century, it was united with the theme of Vaspurakan under a single governor. Taron also became a metropolitan see with 21 suffragan sees. Following the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert against the Seljuk Turks in 1071, an independent Armenian lord named Tornik seized power in Taron, with Muş as his capital. Tornik established a principality which held out as ruler of Taron until overrun by the Turks in 1189/90.

<text>Edmund Plowden (1519/20 – 6 February 1585) was a distinguished English lawyer, legal scholar and theorist during the late Tudor period.

==Early life==

Plowden was born at Plowden Hall, Lydbury North, Shropshire. He was the son of Humphrey Plowden (1490–1557), by his wife, Elizabeth Sturry (died 1559), widow of William Wollascot, and daughter of John Sturry, Esq., of Rossall, Shropshire. Educated at the University of Cambridge, he did not take a degree, and proceeded to the Middle Temple in 1538 to study law. Subsequent to studies at Oxford, he qualified as a surgeon and physician in 1552.

Upon the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary, Plowden was appointed one of the Council of the Marches (of Wales). In 1553, he was elected Member of Parliament for Wallingford (then in Berkshire now in Oxfordshire), followed, in the next two years, by the same office for both Reading, Berkshire and then Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire. He lived mostly at Shiplake Court in Oxfordshire and Wokefield Park in Berkshire. The unusual breadth of his religious views were shown early in his career when he, however, withdrew from the House, on 12 January 1555, because he disapproved of the proceedings there.

==Recusant under Elizabeth==
His Roman Catholicism prevented Plowden from further promotion under Queen Elizabeth I, and he received increasing suspicion from members of the Privy Council. At the beginning of the reign he undertook the management of the Shropshire lands of Sir Francis Englefield, an important Catholic courtier under Mary who went into exile. In 1567 he, with Edward Saunders, became joint guardian of Englefield&#x27;s nephew and heir, Francis, through influence with the Earl of Pembroke.

At one time, it is said, the queen wished to elevate Plowden to the Lord Chancellorship. Plowden declined, deprecating religious persecution. The occasion, according to the &quot;History of Parliament&quot;, could only have been the vacancy of 1578. Plowden continued in the Queen&#x27;s employ in his capacity as a lawyer.

He sought to assist those of his faith, including his defence of Robert Horne, Bishop of Winchester. In 1565 he defended Edmund Bonner, with William Lovelace and Christopher Wray.

==Death==
Plowden died on 6 February 1585 in London and was buried in the Temple Church in London, where survives his monument and recumbent effigy.

==&quot;The case is altered&quot;==
&quot;The case is altered&quot; was a proverbial expression in the 17th century, as well as the title of a 1609 play by Ben Jonson. As &quot;the case is alter&#x27;d, quoth Plowden&quot;, it is attached to anecdotes. In one of them, while defending a gentleman charged with hearing Mass, Plowden worked out that the service had been performed by a layman for the sole purpose of informing against those present, and exclaimed, &quot;The case is altered; no priest, no Mass&quot;, and thus secured an acquittal.

==Works==
Plowden is noted today for his legal scholarship and theory, in his written works:

*&quot;Les comentaries ou les reportes de Edmunde Plowden&quot; (1571) in law French. The &quot;Commentaries&quot; were abridged by Thomas Ashe (around 1597), and indexed by William Fleetwood. They contained a report by Plowden on the legal status of the Duchy of Lancaster in relation to The Crown, and its settlement by Henry IV of England. Plowden and Anthony Browne had, two decades earlier, formulated the theory of the King&#x27;s Two Bodies to explain political arrangements; Ernst Kantorowicz has argued that this doctrine came to the fore in the 1560s, in debates over the status of the Duchy.
*&quot;Quares del Monsieur Plowden&quot;.

&quot;A Treatise on Succession&quot; attempted to prove that Mary, Queen of Scots, was not debarred from the English throne under Henry VIII&#x27;s will.

==Family==
Plowden married Catherine Sheldon of Beoley, daughter of the Worcestershire Member of Parliament William Sheldon; they had three sons and two daughters (Anne and Mary). Anne was the wife of Francis Perkins of Ufton, Berkshire, and Mary was the wife of Richard White of Hutton, Essex. Mary was also the mother of Thomas White.

Plowden&#x27;s sister Margaret inherited the Rossall estates and married Richard Sandford of Eglington. Plowden helped John Cole, husband of Alice Sandford, daughter of Richard, to gain the seat of Bishop&#x27;s Castle in 1584.

<text>The Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy is a trophy presented each year by the commissioner of baseball to Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) World Series champion. The trophy depicts flags representing each team in Major League Baseball. It is the only championship trophy of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in North America that is not named after a particular person (contrasting with the National Hockey League&#x27;s Stanley Cup, Major League Soccer&#x27;s Philip F. Anschutz Trophy, the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy, and the National Football League&#x27;s Vince Lombardi Trophy).

==History==

Although it was named in 1985, the trophy was first awarded in 1967, when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox. Coincidentally, the 1967 World Series was nine months after the first Super Bowl, where the Green Bay Packers were awarded the AFL-NFL World Championship Trophy for defeating the Kansas City Chiefs (the trophy was renamed the Vince Lombardi Trophy prior to Super Bowl V following Lombardi&#x27;s death in September 1970). 

The trophy was not without precedent in Major League Baseball: the Dauvray Cup (named after actress Helen Dauvray) was awarded to the winner of the World Series between the National League and the American Association from 1887 to 1890, and when a solitary major league remained, to the winner of the National League pennant, from 1891 to 1893. The Dauvray Cup was to be held by the victorious team and was to be relinquished the following year when (and if) a new champion team emerged. The Dauvray Cup mysteriously vanished following the 1893 series and has never been located. From 1894 to 1897, the Temple Cup was awarded to the winner of a postseason contest between the two top National League clubs.

A new Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy is created each year, much like the Anschutz Trophy, the O&#x27;Brien Trophy and the Lombardi Trophy, and unlike the Stanley Cup, which is passed from champion to champion (the NBA&#x27;s former championship trophy, the Walter A. Brown Trophy, was passed from champion to champion through 1976; a newly-designed trophy which was to become the O&#x27;Brien Trophy debuted in 1977). Historically, the trophy was only presented in the winner&#x27;s locker room, but beginning in 1997, the presentation occurred on the field if the champion clinched the title in their home stadium. Since 2017, when the Houston Astros won the World Series at Dodger Stadium, the championship presentation occurs on the field even if the champion clinches the title on the road. 

Since its inception, the only year that the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy has not been awarded was 1994, when the players&#x27; strike ended the season on August 12, resulting in the cancellation of the entire post-season. 

The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner&#x27;s Trophies, winning seven World Series since 1977. The St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers have each won four trophies, a National League record.

On October 31, 2018, during the parade celebrating the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series, the trophy was damaged by a beer can thrown by a spectator of the parade; it was subsequently repaired.

In 2020, in discussing the punishments for the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, which did not include stripping the Astros of their 2017 championship, commissioner Rob Manfred referred to the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy as &quot;a piece of metal.&quot; Following criticism for the dismissive nature of the remark, Manfred issued a public apology.

==Design==
The current trophy design was made by Tiffany &amp; Co. and unveiled in 2000. It is tall, excluding the base, and has a diameter of . It weighs approximately and is composed of sterling silver. The trophy features 30 gold-plated flags, one for each Major League team. The flags rise above a silver baseball which is covered with latitude and longitude lines, symbolizing the world, and which features 24-karat vermeil stitching. The base contains an inscription copy of the signature of the commissioner and the words &quot;Presented by the Commissioner of Baseball&quot;.

The original 1967 trophy was designed by Balfour Jewelers of Attleboro, Massachusetts, was modeled after Wrigley Field, and cost $2,500 (). It initially featured 20 gold-plated flags, representing the then-20 Major League Baseball clubs, and a new flag was then subsequently added for each expansion team that joined Major League Baseball. The flags rose above two objects in the center: a golden ring and a golden baseball. The two participating teams in each year&#x27;s World Series were represented by two press pins set on the base of the trophy.

==By franchise==
This table lists the teams that have won the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy since it was introduced in 1967. For a complete history of MLB championship teams, see &quot;List of World Series champions&quot;. The only team to win a World Series and not possess at least one Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy are the Cleveland Guardians/Indians, having last won the World Series in 1948, 19 years before its introduction.

<doc id="1115902" wikidata="Q3120943" url="?curid=1115902" title="Solid Base">
<text>Solid Base is a Swedish-Norwegian Eurodance duo.

The lead singer in the group was Isabelle Heitmann, who was born in Oslo, Norway in 1972. She had a passion for singing since her childhood, and at the age of 10 she moved to Gothenburg, Sweden. A few years after she had moved to Stockholm, she started to sing in various talent competitions. One day she got a phone call from producer Pat Reiniz asking her to sing for him. She ended up singing for Cool James and Black Teacher on their album. At work, she met a man named Niclas Lindberg who recommended her for the Solid Base project.

Rapper Thomas Nordin or Teo T (born 1971) spent his youth living in places like Saudi Arabia, Africa and Indonesia. Once back in Stockholm, he dedicated his time to the growing music life of Stockholm. Teo met the producers Jonas Eriksson and Mattias Eliasson and together they formed the idea of Solid Base.

In 1994, Solid Base released their first single &quot;Together&quot;. They then released several other singles and gained success in Europe. In 1996, their debut album &quot;Finally&quot; was released. It included hit songs like &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, &quot;You Never Know&quot; and &quot;Let It All Be Sunshine&quot;. Two years later, they released their second album &quot;The Take Off&quot; where the song &quot;Come&#x27;n Get Me&quot; is probably their most well-known. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Take Off&quot;, was successful in Japan, being certified gold by the RIAJ in 1998.

The last CD of the 1990s they made was in 1999 with &quot;Express&quot;. By 2001, Solid Base released the album &quot;Party Totale!&quot; in Germany. Their last studio album was &quot;In Action&quot; from 2002. In 2004, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; was released; a Greatest Hits DVD with music videos was also released.

Solid Base returned in 2014 and did a lot of shows around Scandinavia, with Camilla Alvestad as the vocalist.

September 2015, Solid Base released a new single called &quot;Wet&quot; (with Camilla Alvestad)
January 2017, Solid Base released a new single &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Rock It!&quot; (Camilla Alvestad)

Later 2017 Camilla Alvestad left and Veronika Färestål joined as new vocalist.

In 2018, Veronika left and Jenny Redenkvist joined as new vocalist.

<doc id="1115909" wikidata="Q849628" url="?curid=1115909" title="Brian K. Vaughan">
<text>Brian K. Vaughan (; born July 17, 1976) is an American comic book and television writer, best known for the comic book series &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, &quot;Runaways&quot;, &quot;Pride of Baghdad&quot;, &quot;Saga&quot;, and &quot;Paper Girls&quot;.

Vaughan was a writer, story editor and producer of the television series &quot;Lost&quot; during seasons three through five. He was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the fourth season. The writing staff was nominated for the award again at the February 2010 ceremony for their work on the fifth season. He was formerly the showrunner and executive producer of the TV series &quot;Under the Dome&quot;.

&quot;Wired&quot; describes Vaughan&#x27;s comics work as &quot;quirky, acclaimed stories that don&#x27;t pander and still pound pulses&quot;. His creator-owned comics work is also characterized by &quot;finite, meticulous, years-long story arcs&quot;, on which Vaughan comments, &quot;That&#x27;s storytelling, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Something like Spider-Man, a book that never has a third act, that seems crazy.&quot; In 2007, Erik Malinowski, also of &quot;Wired&quot;, called Vaughan &quot;the greatest comic book visionary of the last five years&quot;, comparing him to Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Paul Pope, and Steve Niles, and praised his addition to the TV series &quot;Lost&quot; as redeeming that series&#x27; third season.

For his writing, Vaughan has won 14 Eisner Awards, 15 Harvey Awards, and two Hugo Awards.

==Early life==
Brian K. Vaughan was born July 17, 1976 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Geoffrey and Catherine Vaughan. He grew up in Rocky River and Westlake. Vaughan and his older brother are both fans of writer Peter David, and according to Vaughan, their adolescent comics reading was largely defined by a shared love of David&#x27;s 12-year run on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. Vaughan also cites Joss Whedon as the reason he wanted to become a writer, a decision he made while attending St. Ignatius High School, from which he graduated in 1994.

Vaughan attended the New York University Tisch School of the Arts to study film. While a student there, Vaughan took part in Marvel Comics&#x27;s Stan-hattan Project, a class for fledgling comic book writers.

==Career==
Vaughan&#x27;s first credit was for Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Tales from the Age of Apocalypse&quot; #2 (December 1996). He would eventually write for some of the highest-profile characters at Marvel, including X-Men, Spider-Man, and Captain America. He would also write Batman and Green Lantern for DC Comics, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; for Dark Horse Comics.
From 2002 to 2008, Vaughan, who came to prefer writing his own characters, wrote the creator-owned monthly series &quot;&quot;, a post-apocalyptic science fiction series about the only man to survive the apparent simultaneous death of every male mammal on Earth. The series was published in sixty issues by Vertigo and collected in a series of ten paperback volumes (and later a series of five hardcover &quot;Deluxe&quot; volumes). The series received Eisner Awards in 2005 and 2008, and numerous other nominations. The film rights to the series were acquired by New Line Cinema. Vaughan wrote his own screenplay for the project, though it was reported in March 2012 that Matthew Federman and Stephen Scaia were in final negotiations to write their own version.

In 2006, Vaughan published the graphic novel &quot;Pride of Baghdad&quot;, which centers on a group of lions who escape from an Iraqi zoo after the start of the Iraq War. The book was praised by IGN, who named it the Best Original Graphic Novel of 2006, calling it a &quot;modern classic&quot;, lauding it for combining a tale of survival and family with a powerful analogy of war, and praising Vaughan for representing various viewpoints through the different lion characters.

From 2004 to 2010 Vaughan wrote another creator-owned series, &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, a political thriller that depicts the life of Mitchell Hundred, a former superhero known as the Great Machine who, in the wake of his heroism during the September 11, 2001 attacks, is elected Mayor of New York City. The story is set during Hundred&#x27;s term in office, and interwoven with flashbacks to his past as the Great Machine. Through this, the series explores both the political situations Hundred finds himself in, and the mysteries surrounding his superpowers. New Line Cinema purchased the film rights to the series in July 2005, and commissioned Vaughan to write one of the two commissioned scripts, which he was reported to be working on in 2007. Following the conclusion of &quot;Ex Machina&quot; in 2010, Vaughan reiterated his previous statement that he would concentrate on creator-owned work, saying, &quot;I realized when I turned in this final &quot;Ex Machina&quot; script that it would be the first time I wasn&#x27;t under some kind of deadline at Marvel or DC since 1996. That&#x27;s a huge chunk of my life to spend with those characters. I love them, and I still read Marvel and DC&#x27;s superhero books. I just think I&#x27;m better when I&#x27;m working on my own creations. When there are so many talented creators out there who are better at that stuff than me, I should leave those characters to them. I should do what I&#x27;m fortunate enough to be in the position to do, which is to create more new stuff.&quot;

Vaughan was a writer, executive story editor and producer for seasons 3 to 5 on the ABC TV series &quot;Lost&quot;, a job he earned on the basis of his work on &quot;Y: The Last Man&quot;, of which &quot;Lost&quot; co-creator and executive producer Damon Lindelof was an ardent fan. Lindelof showed that book to series showrunner and executive producer Carlton Cuse. Lindelof relates, &quot;And I told him, &#x27;We need a guy like this on the show, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d ever do it. I don&#x27;t think he even works in L.A.&#x27; And the next thing we knew, he was on the show.&quot; He began his stint on the series as executive story editor with the episode &quot;The Man from Tallahassee&quot;, which premiered in March 2007. Vaughan continued as story editor on several episodes until he began writing episodes, beginning with the episode &quot;Catch-22&quot;, which Vaughan co-wrote with Jeff Pinkner, and premiered in April that year. That episode was praised by &quot;Wired&quot; writer Erik Malinowski, who stated that the themes that Vaughan carried over to &quot;Lost&quot; from his comics work, including intricately crafted storylines typified by pathos and hope, as well as pop culture references, redeemed that series&#x27; third season.

Vaughan would write a total of 7 episodes, the last of which was the April 2009 episode &quot;Dead Is Dead&quot;. He was first credited as a producer with the fourth-season premiere &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;, eventually acting as producer on a total of 29 episodes. He was also a co-producer on &quot;&quot;, a spinoff Internet short film series produced during the hiatus between the show&#x27;s third and fourth seasons.

In November 2011 Steven Spielberg selected Vaughan to adapt the Stephen King novel &quot;Under the Dome&quot; into a television series for Showtime, which is Vaughan&#x27;s first television work since &quot;Lost&quot;. Vaughan was the showrunner and executive producer of the series. He exited the show before the second season premiered in 2014.
On March 14, 2012, Image Comics published the first issue of Vaughan and Fiona Staples&#x27; epic space opera/fantasy series, &quot;Saga&quot;, which he conceived to be a concept strictly relegated to comics, and not adapted to other media. Although Vaughan was a child when he first conceived of the ideas for the book – which owes its inspiration to &quot;Star Wars&quot; – it was not until his wife became pregnant with his second child that he began to write the series, which harbors parenthood as an underlying theme. The series depicts two aliens from warring races trying to survive with their newborn daughter. The book is Vaughan&#x27;s first publication for Image Comics, and represents the first time he has employed first-person narration in his comics writing. The first issue sold out of its first printing ahead of its March 14 release date, with a second printing ordered for April 11, the same release date for issue #2. The series has received positive reviews from MTV, Ain&#x27;t it Cool News, Comic Book Resources, IGN, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine. It has also appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Graphic Books Best Seller List, won three 2013 Eisner Awards, won a Hugo Award and was nominated for seven Harvey Awards.

In March 2013, Vaughan published the first issue of &quot;The Private Eye&quot; with artist Marcos Martín on Panel Syndicate, a pay-what-you-want host for their creative efforts. Panel Syndicate offers DRM-free comics available for purchase/download for whatever price readers wish to pay. Through Panel Syndicate, Vaughan and Martin published 10 issues of &quot;The Private Eye&quot; and released the first issue of &quot;Barrier&quot; in late 2015.

At the Image Expo in January 2015, it was announced that Vaughan would release two new books through Image Comics in 2015: &quot;Paper Girls&quot; with Cliff Chiang and Matthew Wilson, and &quot;We Stand On Guard&quot; with Steve Skroce.

==Personal life==
Vaughan and his wife, a native of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and playwright, live in Los Angeles. They have two children and a pet Dachshund named Hamburger that has been repeatedly referenced as Vaughan&#x27;s aide in selecting letters for the &quot;Saga&quot; letter column. Hamburger has also appeared in an illustration of Vaughan and Fiona Staples that was included in a 2013 &quot;Time&quot; magazine story on &quot;Saga&quot;.

<doc id="1115917" wikidata="Q5684129" url="?curid=1115917" title="Havyaka Brahmins">
<text>Havyaka Brahmin, originally called Havika Brahmana, is a Hindu Brahmin community native to the districts of Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu / Coorg,coastal Karnataka and the Kasaragod district of Kerala. Havyakas fall under the Pancha-Dravida Brahmin category. They are primarily followers of Yajurveda, but some of them follow Rigveda and Samaveda Shakas as well. They follow the Advaita philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya.

== Etymology and origin ==

The word as attested by linguist Sediyapu Krishna Bhat is derived from &quot;Ahichchatra&quot; &quot;Brāhmaṇa&quot;. It was changed to &quot;Ahika&quot; and then &quot;Havika&quot;, and was agreed upon by scholars like Sediyapu and Nadahalli Ranganatha Sharma. The word &quot;Ahichatra Brāhmaṇa&quot; is mentioned in inscriptions. Another etymology that is popular for Havyaka is argued to have derived from the Sanskrit word havya, which means &quot;sacred oblation&quot;. Thus, &quot;Havyaka&quot; could mean &quot;performer of Havana rituals&quot;. However, according to Shri Sediyapu Krishna Bhat, the word &quot;Havyaka&quot; is a Sanskritization of Ahika-Havika. They are referred to as &quot;Haviga&quot; in colonial-era documents by British ethnographers. Some variations of this name are &quot;Haiga&quot; and &quot;Havika&quot;; &quot;Haiga&quot; is also the name of the region that is centered around Gokarna and is bounded by Tulu Nadu to the south; this region is also called &quot;Parashuramakshethra&quot;, &quot;Gorastradesha&quot; or &quot;Gokarnamandala&quot;. Sanskrit scholar Mahamahopadhyaya Nadahalli Ranganatha Sharma rejects the &quot;Havya&quot; + &quot;kavya&quot; derivation as grammatically incorrect. The word &quot;Havyaka&quot; was not used in official records until 1928, including mathas.

Havyakas are descended from Brahmins brought from Ahichchatra by King Mayurasharman who founded the Kadamba dynasty in Kuntala. These Brahmins were originally from the Ahichchatra kingdom near the modern-day Ramnagar village in the modern-day Bareilly district in Uttar Pradesh. They were brought in order to perform Vedic rituals especially the Ashwamedha and were originally housed in &quot;Talagunda Agrahara&quot; near Soraba and Shiralakoppa towns where the inscription attesting to this fact is found. Banavasi, which is 24 kilometers from Sirsi was the capital but Mayuraverma was born in the Talagunda Agrahara. From there, they spread out in the nearby regions primarily following areas which were suitable for areca nut plantations, which they have historically been involved in 

Some claims suggest that the Havyakas originated from the Banavasi region and migrated to Ahichachtra (present-day Uttar Pradesh) in response to the threat posed by non-Vedic sects. Centuries ago, Kadambara Mayuravarman, the founder of Karnataka&#x27;s first royal family, struggled to carry out his religious rituals due to the lack of Brahmins in those days. Therefore, he invited Havyaka families from Ahichachtra to perform Ashwamedha, provided shelter to some villages, and facilitated their settlement. When the Havyakas were concerned about their protection when they came to the Kadamba kingdom, the Kadamba king gave the Haigunda region of the Sharavati shore, which is an island in the midst of the Sharavati River, to the Havyakas so as not to disturb the Vedic works. Sri Ramachandrapura Mutt, one of the most famous gurupeeths, has recently taken charge of Haigunda temple, renovated it under the guidance of Sri Sri Raghaveshwar Bharati Swami, and performs religious programs on special occasions like Navratri.

== Geographic distribution ==
Havyakas are native to the Soraba (ancient town of Surabhipura), Sagara in Shimoga, Uttara Kannada and the Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka and the Kasaragod district of Kerala. A smaller percentage can also be found in the Hosanagara, Shivamogga and Thirthahalli taluks in Shivamogga, Chikmagalur and Kodagu districts. They are found in Sirsi, Siddapura, Yellapura, Kumta and Honnavar in Uttara Kannada; in Puttur and Sullia in Dakshina Kannada in Maravanthe; in Udupi and in the northern parts of the Kasaragod district such as Kumbla .

== Rituals ==
Males undergo the Upanayana when they turn seven years old to initiate their Vedic studies. It is also known as &quot;Brahmopadesha&quot;. The key ritual during Upanayana is that of putting a sacred thread called &quot;yajnopavitha&quot; or &quot;janivaara&quot; consisting of three cotton strands across the left shoulder to the right waist of the boy. The initiate is called a dvija &quot;twice-born&quot; and is expected to perform the Sandhyavandana at least twice daily. Yajnopavitha has a special knot in it which is called as &quot;Brahma Gantu&quot;. Havyaka Brahmins also undergo the Upakarma, where the sacred thread is changed.

In old Vedas, it is mentioned that after Upanayana, the boy enters the stage of Brahmacharya ashrama, leading a celibate and austere life of a student in his teacher&#x27;s home and eating from handouts given by the neighbours. When he has accomplished his studies of the Vedas, he enters the Grahastha ashram, as a married man, becoming head of his household. During the wedding, the groom wears two janivaaras at the same time to signify his marriage.

== Language ==
The Havyakas are united by their language, known as Havigannada, which is a dialect of Kannada. There are two distinct dialects of the Havyaka language. One in Uttara Kannada and Shivamogga districts and another in Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragodu districts. The dialect differs from mainstream Kannada; non-Havyakas who understand and speak Kannada cannot usually understand Havigannada.

Most Havyakas also understand mainstream Kannada (particularly, the Havyakas living in Bangalore, who speak Bangalore Kannada outdoors and Havigannada at home); the Havyakas who are native to Dakshina Kannada also understand Tulu and those from Kasaragod speak Havigannada at home and Malayalam outdoors. Havyakas who are settled in Goa and Karwar understand and speak Konkani. Apart from this, many of them, especially those living in metropolitan cities, can speak Hindi and English.

== Havyaka cuisine ==

The Havyakas follow a lacto-vegetarian diet. Compared to the cuisines of other communities of South India, Havyaka cuisine is milder and less spicy. Rice, curds, buttermilk and vegetables are the staples used in Havyaka cuisine. Coconut is used in a lot of dishes. Some popular Havyaka dishes include:
* Thambuli: A dish of chopped vegetables with curd or buttermilk and a seasoning of spices fried in oil.
* Sasime: A dish prepared with the ground paste of any vegetable along with curd and a seasoning of spices fried in oil.
* Appe huli: A sour and tangy watery soup made from unripe mangoes and chilly.
* Patrode: A dish made of colocasia leaves.
* Melara: Mild coconut-yogurt curry which can be made using various vegetables.
Curries are prepared from unripe jackfruits, the ripe jackfruit is used to cook items such as dosas and halvas.

<doc id="1115920" wikidata="Q4263041" url="?curid=1115920" title="Postal codes in Malaysia">
<text>[[Postal code]]s in [[Malaysia]], usually referred to as postcodes (Malay: &quot;poskod&quot;), are five digit numeric.

The first two digits of the postcode denote the state or federal territory (e.g. 42000 Port Klang, Selangor). However, postcode area boundaries may cross state borders, as areas near to state borders may be served by post offices located in another state, and therefore use postcodes of the assigned post offices.

==History==
Malaysia&#x27;s current postcode system was initiated by M. Rajasingam, director-general of Pos Malaysia from 1976 to 1986. In 1976, only addresses in Kuala Lumpur had postcodes. Wanting to expand the postcode system to the whole country, Rajasingam enlisted the help of the French postal authorities. The postcode system made the process of sorting out mail smoother, as it was easier for machines to recognise the numbers. In 2014, Rajasingam was honoured with the &quot;Darjah Panglima Jasa Negara&quot; (PJN), which carries the title of &quot;Datuk&quot;, for his contributions to the postal service.

==Areas==
Listed below are the first 2 digits of codes assigned to each state and federal territory. The state capital for each state is indicated in brackets.

===Federal Territories===
* Kuala Lumpur uses codes from 50000 to 60000 (Including a few areas such as Cheras, Taman Melawati, Bukit Lanjan, Bandar Sri Damansara, Pandan Indah which are actually in Selangor), and 68100 (Taman Wahyu and Kuala Lumpur Wholesale Market under the Kuala Lumpur jurisdiction) 
* Putrajaya uses codes from 62300 to 62988
* Labuan uses codes from 87xxx to 87033

===States===
* Selangor (Shah Alam) uses codes from 40xxx to 48300, 63xxx to 68100
* Terengganu (Kuala Terengganu) uses codes from 20xxx to 24300
* Sarawak (Kuching) uses codes from 93xxx to 98859
* Sabah (Kota Kinabalu) uses codes from 88xxx to 91309 (Including Layang-Layang Island)
* Kedah (Alor Setar) uses codes from 05xxx to 09810
* Kelantan (Kota Bharu) uses codes from 15xxx to 18500
* Negeri Sembilan (Seremban) uses codes from 70xxx to 73509
* Penang/Pulau Pinang (George Town) uses codes from 10xxx to 14400
* Johor (Johor Bahru) uses codes from 79xxx to 86900
* Malacca/Melaka (Malacca City) uses codes from 75xxx to 78309
* Perlis (Kangar) uses codes from 01xxx to 02xxx
* Perak (Ipoh) uses codes from 30xxx to 36810
* Pahang (Kuantan) uses codes from 25xxx to 28800, 390xx to 39200 for Cameron Highlands, 49000 for Fraser&#x27;s Hill and 69000 for Genting Highlands, 28xxx to 28350 for Temerloh district

<doc id="1115930" wikidata="Q5617963" url="?curid=1115930" title="Gulzar Singh Cheema">
<text>Gulzar Singh Cheema (born August 11, 1954) is an Indian-born Canadian physician and politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1993, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 2001 to 2004, making him one of only a few Canadian politicians to have sat in two provincial legislatures since Confederation. He is the first Indian-born provincial legislator in Canada. He was also a cabinet minister in the government of Premier of British Columbia Gordon Campbell from 2001 to 2004, and was a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal election of 2004.

==Background==
The son of Ajinder Singh Cheema and Ajit Kaur Aulakh, he grew up in Gurdaspur district in Punjab, India. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in medicine and surgery from Punjab University in 1977, then worked as a clinical instructor. He moved to Canada in 1979, and married Harinder Claire the same year; they have two children together. Following his internship at the Memorial University of Newfoundland and residency at Saskatoon&#x27;s Royal University Hospital, he moved to Winnipeg where he practised as a family physician from 1984 to 1993.

==Political career==

=== Manitoba politics ===
In the Manitoba general election of 1988, Cheema was elected as a Liberal in the Winnipeg riding of Kildonan. The Liberals went from one to twenty seats in the Manitoba legislature in this election, winning several Winnipeg seats from the governing New Democratic Party (NDP). Cheema defeated Progressive Conservative candidate John Baluta by 585 votes, with NDP incumbent Marty Dolin finishing third. The Progressive Conservatives came out of the election with a minority government, and Cheema became a member of the official opposition. Cheema increased his margin of victory in the 1990 provincial election when he ran in the new riding of The Maples, but the Liberal Party fell to seven seats and third-party status. During his time in the Manitoba assembly, he served as critic for health, labour, housing, native affairs, sport and co-operatives, and consumer and corporate affairs. He resigned his seat on June 17, 1993.

=== British Columbia politics ===
Soon afterwards, Cheema opened a family practice in Surrey, British Columbia. He became involved in several community activities in British Columbia, including acting as chair of the 1998 British Columbia Games for Athletes with Disabilities&#x27; medical section. He also made regular appearances on local multicultural radio talk shows and television station OMNI BC (previously Channel M) to educate the Indo-Canadian community on health and disease prevention.

In the 1996 provincial election, Cheema ran as a BC Liberal in the riding of Vancouver-Fraserview, but lost to BC NDP candidate Ian Waddell by 380 votes.

The BC NDP experienced a sharp decline in popularity in the following years, and the provincial Liberals were elected in a landslide in the 2001 provincial election. This time Cheema ran in Surrey-Panorama Ridge, where he defeated NDP candidate Bruce Ralston by over 6,000 votes to become the riding&#x27;s member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). He was appointed to the cabinet that June by Premier Gordon Campbell to serve as Minister of State for Mental Health, before being re-assigned in January 2004 as Minister of State for Immigration and Multicultural Services.

=== Federal politics ===
Later in 2004, Cheema sought and won the federal Liberal nomination in the new riding of Fleetwood—Port Kells. His cabinet appointment was rescinded on March 8, 2004, and he subsequently resigned as MLA that May. At the June 2004 federal election, Cheema was defeated by Conservative candidate Nina Grewal, 14,052 votes to 11,568 (New Democratic Party candidate Barry Bell received 10,976 votes).

=== Return to BC politics ===
In the 2020 provincial election, Cheema was the BC Liberal candidate in Surrey-Panorama, a reconfigured version of his old riding. He was defeated by incumbent NDP member Jinny Sims.

==Honours==
Cheema was awarded the Canada 125 Medal in 1992 for community service. In 2021, a new street in northwest Winnipeg was named Cheema Drive in his honour.

<text>Gardman (), also known as Gardmank&#x27; or Gardmanadzor, was one of the eight cantons of the ancient province of Utik&#x27; in the Kingdom of Armenia and simultaneously, together with the canton of Tuch&#x27;katak, an Armenian principality. It roughly corresponded within the Gazakh, Shamkir, Aghstafa, Dashkasan, Goygol, Tovuz, Gadabay districts of modern-day Azerbaijan and the original Tavush Region of Armenia. Gardman was also the name of the central fortress of the canton.

==History==
In the view of historian Robert H. Hewsen, the name Gardman might be of Georgian origin. Many contemporary Armenian authors referred to Gardman as a part of the (&#x27;province, land&#x27;) of Artsakh. During the reign of the Arsacid kings of Armenia (66–428 A.D.), Gardman was the seat of the of Utik&#x27;. For this reason, Utik&#x27; was sometimes called , or the principality of the Gardmanians. Gardman was acquired by Caucasian Albania in 387 following the partition of Armenia. In the seventh century, the local house of Gardman was replaced by the Mihranid family (of Persian or Parthian origin), which later became the ruling dynasty in the region of Arran. During the rule of the Mihranids (7th-8th centuries), the region of Utik&#x27; came to be referred to as Gardman. 

The region was conquered by the Arabs in 855. Contemporary Armenian historians repeatedly noted the presence of two well known locations in Gardman: a fortress called Getabakk&#x27; (in the current-day Azerbaijani region of Gadabay) and a copper mine.

In 982, Gardman and Parisos, the northern district of Artsakh, became the small Armenian kingdom of Parisos, which lasted until 1017 and thereafter became part of the Kingdom of Lori. In 1601, the princely family of Melik-Shahnazaryan established the &quot;melikdom&quot; of Gardman. The ruling family belonged to a branch of the House of Khachen, and their residence was in the village of Voskanapat (and for this reason, the statelet was sometimes referred to as the Voskanapat melikdom). The territorial rights of the meliks were confirmed after the Russian Empire took control of the region in the early nineteenth century.

<doc id="1115938" wikidata="Q18122904" url="?curid=1115938" title="Abaza family">
<text>The Abaza family (; , or , ; ) is an Egyptian aristocratic family of maternal Abazin, Circassian, and paternal Egyptian origins whose historical stronghold is in the Nile Delta.

It has been decsribed as &quot;deeply rooted in Egyptian society... [and] in the history of the country&quot; and has had an influence from the late 18th century to modern times.

The family has had an impact on Egyptian and Arabic culture. Their contributions were through the works of authors, journalists, and activists Ismail Pasha Abaza and Fekry Pasha Abaza, author Ibrahim Desouky Bek Abaza, poet Aziz Pasha Abaza, novelist Tharwat Abaza, sociologist Mona Abaza, actor Rushdy Abaza, multiple other actors and directors, among others in various fields. 

It has been criticized for &quot;monopolizing&quot; several parliamentary districts since the 19th century &quot;reign of Muhammad Ali&quot;.

The clan has sometimes been referred to as &quot;the family of the pashas&quot; for having produced Egypt&#x27;s largest number of nobles.

They are thought to number in the many thousands, with sources varying in their estimates. However, these numbers are thought to be highly unreliable as no local censuses of Circassian communities exist due to a general &quot;lack in demographic data on minorities in Egypt&quot;.

== Overview, origin, and name ==
Sources indicate that the Abaza family was well established in the Nile Delta by the late 18th century especially in their stronghold, Sharqia.

Historian al-Sayyid-Marsot states that the Abaza family were named after &quot;a beloved grandmother ... or her place of birth&quot;. This maternal ancestor married the head of the powerful al-Ayed family (; ) before the reign of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The &quot;marriage was during the reign of the&quot; Mamluks and &quot;under Ottoman rule&quot;.[note 1]

David E. Millis writes of the Abaza family&#x27;s marriage with the al-Ayed clan reporting that the latter&#x27;s history in Egypt is of 1400 years. He states al-Ayed trace &quot;their origin back to the Yemenese contingents of the initial Islamic conquerors of Egypt [639-642 AD]... [and] the ancient tribal confederation of Judham&quot;. Ibn Khaldun wrote that Banu Judham originate from Kahlan. Historian al-Maqrizi agrees that al-Ayed descend from Banu Judham.

The non-Abaza patriarch who married the Abazin matriarch was Sheikh Muhammed al-Ayedi ().

Al-Sayyid-Marsot reports that the Abaza family had &quot;long-established economic and political clout in Egypt&quot;.

Historians document that with time people started to &quot;distinguish between &quot;Awlad al-Aydeh&quot; [Children of al-Aydeh] and &quot;Awlad al-Abazyya&quot; [Children of the Abaza Lady]&quot; and her eldest son began to be called &quot;&quot;Ibn al-Abazyya&quot; [Son of the Abaza Lady]&quot;. This was &quot;the beginning of the split between the two groups&quot; into two distinct families or clans.

Thus, the initial matriarchal founder of the family is only known as &#x27;Abaza&#x27;, and her personal name is lost to history. It is rare but not unknown for a Muslim family to be named after a woman but the family&#x27;s name fits with Muslim practices of naming people and families after places of origin or ethnicities. 
It is an example of a &quot;laqab&quot;, a type of Arabic name, and of an ethnonym, the name of a people or ethnic group.

Some intermarriage with the ruling Turkish elite in Egypt is also reported. Of their Abazin Circassian roots one scholar remarks that &quot;the Abazas remain notoriously blonde and pink-cheeked, a living proof of continued Circassian and Turkish intermarriage.&quot; They are also noted for extensive intermarrying with fellow elite families: &quot;The Abazinians in Egypt have managed to become part of Egypt&#x27;s elite. For many generations they have inter-married with the movers and shakers of Egypt&quot;.

Historian Robert Springborg documents that Abazas in Egypt are &quot;virtually all descendants&quot; of 19th century figures like Sheikh of the Arabs Hassan Abaza and his brother Sheikh Boghdady Abaza and &quot;they maybe considered as constituting one family&quot;.

== Rise, history, and politics ==

Reuven Aharoni in his historical study of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty discusses the Abaza family&#x27;s rise. He states that despite the &quot;centralized nature of Muhammed Ali&#x27;s regime&quot;, the integration of local elites in the state&#x27;s administration was part of his governing policy. The provincial elites were &quot;given lands&quot; integrating the new system with existing &quot;local interests&quot; and documents that &quot;one instance of this&quot; was the Abaza family.

Hassan Abaza is widely considered to be the modern founding father of the family due to heading the family at the time of their modern ascendance. He was called &quot;&quot;Sheikh of the Arabs&quot;.&quot; 

Relatively rare in this exalted long-form, it derives from the ancient honorific title &#x27;Sheikh&#x27; given to a variety of people including the heads of sufficiently influential families or tribes regardless of ethnic origin. Aharoni reports that Hassan Abaza was also the &quot;Shiekh el Balad&quot; [Sheikh of the Province or &quot;chief of the city&quot;] of the province of Sharqia. 

Hassan Abaza &quot; served in higher positions than that of village shaikh, for he became &quot;nazir&quot;, then &quot;mamur&quot;, then &quot;bash&quot; [Pasha] &quot;muawin&quot; of the provinces of Sharqiyya and Daqahliyya&quot;, two of the multiple provinces Abazas governed again in the following centuries.

Hassan and his brother, Sheikh Boghdady Abaza, &quot;served in Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s Majlis&quot; making the Abazas the only family to hold two seats at the same time and starting their tradition as a parliamentary dynasty.

Aharoni further documents that the monarchy allowed in certain instances elites &quot;bequeath their posts to their sons&quot;. The Abaza family is recorded as a notable instance of this, for example, al-Sayed Pasha Abaza &quot;inherited the position of &quot;nizar qism&quot; from &quot;his father Hassan Abaza&quot;.

The monarchy endowed the family with more villages and lands allowing the Abazas to flourish.

Their lands extended beyond their Sharqia stronghold to the Beheira Governate. For example, &quot;Sayed Pasha Abaza &quot;mudir&quot; [governor] of Beheira Province left some 6,000 feddan [6227 acres]...in 1875-1876&quot; to his descendants.

Their influence further extended to the Nile Delta provinces of Al-Qalyubia, Monufia, and Dakahlia.

It has been argued that Ismail Pasha Abaza was a precursor and &quot;rehearsal&quot; for Ahmed Urabi Pasha, the revolutionary Egyptian leader, due to his &quot;[having] the first positive and effective political role [in anti-occupation politics] ...[with] great importance and relevance to the burgeoning national movement&quot; and by having influential and &quot;good relations with [royal ruler] Khedive Abbas Helmi&quot; of Egypt. This was also documented in the memoirs of Ahmed Urabi Pasha. 

Additionally, Ismail Pasha Abaza &quot;believed he could secure national rights&quot; through negotiation with the British and went to England to attempt this.
A famous display of their clout was during the accession of the young King Farouk, when the Abaza family &quot;solicited palace authorities to permit the royal train to stop briefly at one of their villages&quot;, so that &quot;the king could partake in refreshments which were offered in a large, magnificently ornamented tent they had erected at the train station&quot;.

After the 1952 removal of King Farouk of Egypt, several Abazas lost feudal lands following the Egyptian land reform.

The family is not associated with a single political stance as in the early 20th century it decided to allow all members to hold any political position and run for office with any party with the caveat that &quot;no two Abazas [can] run against each other&quot;.

During the CBC Two program where this was discussed, Mahmoud Abaza, opposition leader under Mubarak&#x27;s regime, clarified that in the rare cases where two Abazas ran in an election against each other the apparent rule is &quot;to put all support behind the stronger [candidate]&quot; and that &quot;no other rules exist&quot;.

This led to situations where one Abaza was a minister in the governing regime and another was Mahmoud Abaza as opposition leader (see below).

Anti-feudal and anti-classist politics also exists within the family. Perhaps the most thorough example is a book by Mona Abaza, a prominent Egyptian sociologist. In her lengthy scholarly ethnographic study of her family&#x27;s feudal estate she is explicit about her experience of how ordinary farmers treated members of the family writing critically that she was &quot;astonish[ed] at ...[a] peasant’s extraordinarily subservient behavior to a fifteen-year-old girl... no peasant in older times was allowed to stare at the ladies of the da’ira [the estate], or even to confront them face to face... all the ladies of the da’ira had to be addressed in the masculine as a sign of their superiority.&quot; 

She also documented at length the nature of the production process standard at the time in large aristocratic estates with documentation that &quot;reveal an incredible obsession [for] controlling...[in] a highly stratified... pyramidal order&quot;. 

The family had its own football team competing with Egypt&#x27;s major clubs in the early half of the 20th century and its own journal. Their most famous wins were covered in English media in 1916 and 1917 with two reported wins against Qatar. A lentil dish attributed to the family is known in the country as ads abazy&quot; ().

== Contemporary period ==
The family has had members in almost every Egyptian parliament, mostly in Sharqia districts, their original historical stronghold. A famous 21st-century election included the family&#x27;s 2005 winning challenge to Gamal Mubarak&#x27;s and the Mubarak regime&#x27;s candidate in a Sharqia district with the former New Wafd Party opposition leader Mahmoud Abaza.

Family members also regularly feature in Egyptian cabinets and hold minister, deputy minister, assistant minister and other government and technocratic positions in state institutions. As mentioned above, Amin Abaza was a minister at the same time Mahmoud Abaza was the leader of the official opposition during the final Hosni Mubarak government. The family has also held governorships many times in both the monarchical and current periods, especially in the Nile delta but also including the likes of Cairo and the Suez Canal Zone.

Some Egyptian media in the 21st century have referred to them as one of the &quot;families that rule the country&quot; due to the number of politicians, officials, and members of parliament it produced, and as one of the families that &quot;inherited parliament&quot;.

As of 2024, General Hani Deri Abaza, Ahmed Fuad Abaza, and Vadji Hussain Abaza are members of the Egyptian House of Representatives. In addition, Yousra Fuad Abaza is a member of the Egyptian Senate.

Many villages in the Nile Delta are named after members of the family. At least two city squares, in Zagazig and another in Cairo, are named &#x27;Abaza&#x27;. Many roads and institutions in the country are named after members of the family for example at least one street and one government school named after Aziz Pasha Abaza and a street named after Ismail Pasha Abaza. In addition, numerous &quot;&#x27;ezbas&quot;&#x27; (farming villages) in the Nile Delta provinces are named after family members.

Forbes lists Hussein Abaza as one of the top Arab CEOs in the world, for heading the Commercial International Bank.

Another family member, Hussein Mohammed Abaza serves as an international consultant for sustainable development and green economy in the Egyptian government and as an advisor to the Minister of the Environment. He also is a member of the government&#x27;s National Initiative for Green Projects.

Primarily criticism of the family has focused on multi-generational control exerted on various areas which are part of their historical stronghold.

In the 2015 parliamentary elections, three members of the Abaza family won seats in the House of Representatives and this was criticized by some in the media referring to their win as &quot;dynastic heredity&quot;. For decades, the family had a political monopoly over several districts. In modern times media has critically remarked that &quot;no parliamentary elections since the reign of Muhammed Ali was free of the Abazas&quot;.

In an incident showcasing the ubiquity of the Abaza family&#x27;s entrenchment in Egyptian institutions, Amin Abaza, Minister of Agriculture under the final Hosni Mubarak government was arrested and tried as part of the mass trials of that government following the 2011 Egyptian revolution. As mentioned above, another Abaza was an opposition leader during this government. Initially the public prosecutor who ordered the arrest and is himself married to an Abaza, instituted travel bans on figures associated with the regime and its final cabinet. An appeals court later freed minister Amin Abaza.

In 2014, the family sued Sada Elbalad TV for the creation of a children&#x27;s cartoon named &#x27;Abaza&#x27;, and the program was forced off the air. In the same year Egyptian satellite channel CBC Two aired a one-hour documentary about the family.

They are also known for producing many CEOs and owners of businesses and corporations.

Their combined wealth is unknown.

==Notable members==
The family features a substantial number of famous or influential members and thus this section will keep to a few examples from the 20th and 21st centuries.

<text>The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) is a large species of turtle in the family Chelydridae. The species is endemic to freshwater habitats in the United States. &quot;M. temminckii&quot; is one of the heaviest living freshwater turtles in the world. It is the largest freshwater species of turtle in North America. It is often associated with, but not closely related to, the common snapping turtle, which is in the genus &quot;Chelydra&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;temminckii&quot; is in honor of Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.

==Taxonomy==
Although it was once believed that only one extant species exists in the genus &quot;Macrochelys&quot;, recent studies have shown that there are two species, the other being the Suwannee snapping turtle (&quot;M. suwanniensis&quot;) of the Suwannee River. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the two species lived approximately 3.2 to 8.9 million years ago, during the late Miocene to late Pliocene. A third species, the Apalachicola snapping turtle (&quot;M. apalachicolae&quot;), has been proposed, but is generally not recognized.

The alligator snapping turtle is given its common name because of its immensely powerful jaws and distinct ridges on its shell that are similar in appearance to the rough, ridged skin of an alligator. It is also slightly less commonly known as &quot;the loggerhead snapper&quot; (not to be confused with the loggerhead sea turtle or loggerhead musk turtle).

==Distribution and habitat==
The alligator snapping turtle is found primarily in freshwaters of the southeastern United States. It is found from the Florida Panhandle west to East Texas, north to southeastern Kansas, Missouri, southeastern Iowa, western Illinois, southern Indiana, west Michigan western Kentucky, Louisiana, and western Tennessee. Typically, only nesting females venture onto open land.

They are generally found only in bodies of water that flow into the Gulf of Mexico and usually do not occur in isolated wetlands or ponds. A study found that the turtles prefer places with canopy cover, overhanging trees, shrubs, dead submerged trees, and beaver dens. This species utilizes core sites within these habitats, and females tend to have larger movement patterns than males. The average home range for an individual is . Females have larger home ranges than males.

==Description==
The alligator snapping turtle is characterized by a large, heavy head, and a long, thick shell with three dorsal ridges of large scales (osteoderms), giving it a primitive appearance reminiscent of some of the plated dinosaurs, most notably &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;. It can be immediately distinguished from the common snapping turtle by the three distinct rows of spikes and raised plates on the carapace, whereas the common snapping turtle has a smoother carapace. The spikes on the carapace gradually flatten out as the turtle ages. &quot;M. temminckii&quot; is a solid gray, brown, black, or olive-green in color, and often covered with algae. It has radiating yellow patterns around the eyes, serving to break up the outline of the eyes to keep the turtle camouflaged. The eyes are also surrounded by a star-shaped arrangement of fleshy, filamentous &quot;eyelashes&quot;.

Though not verified, a alligator snapping turtle was found in Kansas in 1937, but the largest verifiable one is debatable. One weighed at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago was a 16-year resident giant alligator snapper weighing , sent to the Tennessee Aquarium as part of a breeding loan in 1999, where it subsequently died. Another weighing was housed at the Brookfield Zoo in suburban Chicago. Another large turtle reportedly weighed . The species generally does not grow quite that large. Breeding maturity is attained around , when the straight carapace length is around , but then the species continues to grow throughout life. Excluding exceptionally large specimens, adult alligator snapping turtles generally range in carapace length from and weigh from . Males are typically larger than females. 88 adult alligator snapping turtles averaged , 92 averaged , and 249 averaged . Usually very old males comprise the specimens that weigh in excess of per most population studies. Among extant freshwater turtles, only the little-known giant softshell turtles of the genera &quot;Chitra&quot;, &quot;Rafetus&quot;, and &quot;Pelochelys&quot;, native to Asia, reach comparable sizes.

In mature specimens, those with a straight carapace length over , males and females can be differentiated by the position of the cloaca from the carapace, and by the thickness of the base of the tail. A mature male&#x27;s cloaca extends beyond the carapace edge, a female&#x27;s is placed exactly on the edge if not nearer to the plastron. The base of the tail of the male is also thicker as compared to that of the female because of the hidden reproductive organs.

The inside of the turtle&#x27;s mouth is camouflaged, and it possesses a (worm-shaped) appendage on the tip of its tongue used to lure fish, a form of aggressive mimicry. With its unique head morphology, research suggests that this species has strong natural selection for bite performance, which can directly or indirectly affect fitness. Research suggests that &quot;M.temminckii&quot; thermoregulates by altering its depth in the water column, because this species is rarely seen basking.
This turtle must be handled with extreme care and considered potentially dangerous. This species can bite through the handle of a broom and rare cases have been reported in which human fingers have been cleanly bitten off by the species. No human deaths have been reported to have been caused by the alligator snapping turtle.

==Diet==
The alligator snapping turtle is an opportunistic feeder that is almost entirely carnivorous. It relies on both catching live food and scavenging dead organisms. In general, it will eat almost anything it can catch. Fishermen have glorified the species&#x27; ability to catch fish and to deplete fish populations, whereas in fact it largely targets any abundant and easily caught prey, and rarely has any extensive deleterious effect on fish populations. Its natural diet consists primarily of fish and fish carcasses, mollusks, carrion, and amphibians, but it is also known to eat snakes, snails, worms and other invertebrates, crayfish, insects, water birds, aquatic plants, other turtles and sometimes even small alligators. In one study conducted in Louisiana, 79.8% of the stomach contents of adult alligator snapping turtles was found to be composed of other turtles, although the resistance of shell and reptile-bone fragments to digestion may have led these fragments to remain longer in the digestive tract than other items. This species may also, on occasion, prey on aquatic rodents, including nutrias and muskrats or even snatch small to mid-sized other mammals, including squirrels, mice, opossums, raccoons, and armadillos when they attempt to swim or come near the water&#x27;s edge.

In the wild, alligator snapping turtles are also recorded eating a wide range of plant matter such as seeds, tubers, stalks, American persimmons, wild grape, water hickory, pecans, and locust. Between March and October, stomach samples of 65 turtles showed that 56% of their diet by volume was composed of acorns of water, overcup, and willow oaks. The most frequently eaten food item was fish; despite this, fish only made up 7% of their diet by volume. Mammalian and bird prey, although less frequently eaten, made up 10% and 7% of the diet by volume respectively. As ingested willow oak acorns were found to germinate faster after defecation, it is suggested that alligator snapping turtles may be important seed dispersers of oak trees. While downstream dispersal of acorns is passive, ingestion by alligator snapping turtles could facilitate dispersal of acorns upstream as well as laterally across streams.

The alligator snapping turtle seemingly most often hunts at night. It may also hunt diurnally, however. By day, it may try to attract fish and other prey by sitting quietly at the bottom of murky water and letting its jaws hang open to reveal its tongue appendage, which looks like a small, pink worm in the back of its gray mouth, and lure the prey into striking distance. The vermiform tongue imitates the movements of a worm, luring prey to the turtle&#x27;s mouth. The mouth is then closed with tremendous speed and force, completing the ambush. Although the turtle does not actively hunt its prey, it can detect chemosensory cues from prey, like the mud turtle, in order to choose the location in which it is most likely to catch food. Small fish, such as minnows, are often caught in this way by younger alligator snapping turtles, whereas adults must eat a greater quantity per day and must forage more actively. Though not a regular food source for them, adult alligator snappers have even been known to kill and eat small American alligators.

==Reproduction and lifespan==
Maturity is reached around 12 years of age. Mating takes place yearly, in early spring in the southern part of its geographic range, and in later spring in the northern part. About two months later, the female builds a nest and lays a clutch of 10–50 eggs. It was found that some females lay eggs every year and some females lay eggs every other year. The sex of the young depends on the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. This is called temperature dependent sex determination, and it is used by all turtle species to determine sex. For the alligator snapping turtle, higher temperatures produce more males in a clutch. Nests are typically excavated at least 50 yards from the water&#x27;s edge to prevent them from being flooded and drowned. Incubation takes from 100 to 140 days, and hatchlings emerge in the early fall.

Though its potential lifespan in the wild is unknown, the alligator snapping turtle is believed to be capable of living to 200 years of age, but 80 to 120 is more likely. In captivity, it typically lives between 20 and 70 years.

==Predation==
The alligator snapping turtle is most vulnerable to predators before and shortly after hatching. The eggs can be eaten by birds or mammals. The risk of predation decreases as the turtle gets bigger, so the adult turtle does not have as many predators. Their largest predator in many parts of their range is the northern river otter &quot;(Lontra canadensis)&quot; when the turtles are young.

Humans are also a threat to the alligator snapping turtle.

==Under human care==
The alligator snapping turtle is sometimes captive-bred as a pet and is readily available in the exotic animal trade. Due to its potential size and specific needs, it does not make a particularly good pet for any but the most experienced aquatic turtle keepers.

It prefers to feed on live fish, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy vegetables if offered. Hand feeding is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle&#x27;s appetite and would result in the turtle refusing to feed until the temperature has been regulated.

Due to the turtle&#x27;s sheer size, handling an adult specimen poses significant problems. With relative safety, a smaller turtle is held by the sides of its shell. A larger turtle, with its proportionately longer neck and greater reach, is held safely by grasping it just behind the head or close to the tail&#x27;s base.

Despite its reputation, the alligator snapping turtle is typically not prone to biting. However, if provoked, it is quite capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily amputate fingers or cause other significant injuries, such as cuts. In some U.S. states, where the alligator snapping turtle does not naturally occur (such as California), it is prohibited from being kept as a pet by residents.

==Invasive species==
Some alligator snapping turtles were released or escaped into waters of the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary. In Bavaria, a turtle was accused of causing injury to a child, but the claim was never substantiated and the turtle in question was never found. In Bohemia, four turtles of this species have been caught. In Hungary, one turtle was caught in the middle of a street near a lake. Alligator snapping turtles have been found throughout Italy beginning in the early 2000s. Certain EU countries have strong laws against keeping the alligator snapping turtle without permission, as it is an invasive species.

In February 2024, a single male was found in Urswick Tarn in Cumbria, England. The turtle, which was nicknamed &#x27;Fluffy&#x27; by his rescuers, has since been moved to the National Centre for Reptile Welfare in Kent.

There are non-native established invasive populations of the alligator snapping turtle in South Africa.

==Conservation status==
Because of collection for the exotic pet trade, overharvesting for its meat, and habitat destruction, some states have imposed bans on collecting the alligator snapping turtle from the wild. The IUCN lists it as a threatened species, and as of 23 February 2023, it was listed as a CITES Appendix II species, meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permit system.

The alligator snapping turtle is now endangered in several states, including Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri, where it is protected by state law. It is designated as &quot;in need of conservation&quot; in Kansas.

In October 2013, one was found in the Prineville Reservoir in Oregon. It was captured and euthanized by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which considers alligator snapping turtles to be an invasive species. This one was the first found in the state.

In June 2024, it was announced captive alligator snapping turtles, bred in Oklahoma, would be reintroduced to the Neosho River in Kansas in hopes of bringing them back to its waterways.

<text>Daranali or Daranaghi () was a district (&quot;gavar&quot;) of the province of Upper Armenia of Greater Armenia. It was located in the basin of the Western Euphrates (Karasu), near modern-day Kemah (Kamakh, Kamacha, Camachus), Turkey. Its center was the fortified settlement of Ani (not to be confused with the medieval Armenian capital), which was located on the right bank of the Western Euphrates, across from Kemah. It was famous for its fertile lands, plentiful waters and salt mines.

It likely fell into the region of Acilisene (later Ekegheatsʻ) mentioned in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. It is first mentioned in Armenian sources by Faustus of Byzantium, who describes it and the district of Ekegheatsʻ as the property of Gregory the Illuminator&#x27;s family. Daranali is most famous for having contained the burial-place of the Arsacid Armenian kings at Ani. It was also a major religious center in pagan times, as it was home to a temple to Aramazd at Ani and a temple to Mihr at Bagayarichʻ built by Tigranes the Great. The entire district may have belonged to the temple of Mihr. Following the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of Armenia in the 4th century, the temple at Bagayarichʻ was destroyed by Gregory the Illuminator and Daranali became the property of the Armenian church.

<text>Karin or [[Carin]] is a common feminine given name in various Germanic languages (geographically including Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Switzerland), and Estonia and Slovenia, and in some French-speaking areas, as well as Japanese.

In most of its Western forms, Karin was originally a Swedish form of Katherine, but in English speaking countries is usually thought of as an alternate spelling for Karen.

The Japanese name Karin (花梨, かりん) means Chinese quince (&quot;Pseudocydonia sinensis&quot;), quince (&quot;Cydonia oblonga&quot;) or Burmese rosewood (&quot;Pterocarpus indicus&quot;) and is unrelated to the Western forms.

In Thailand, it is written as กา ริน and read as &#x27;karin&#x27;. However, in Thailand it is mainly used as a male name.

<text>Sailormongering is the practice of boarding a ship approaching or newly arrived in port without the permission of its master, and inciting members of its crew to desert their posts and come ashore by tempting them with prostitutes and alcohol. The intention behind the activity might be to subject the unguarded vessel to piracy, hold the inebriated sailors hostage or simply drum up business for local taverns and brothels. At the time when the practice was common, it was often accomplished by sending prostitutes carrying large quantities of alcohol onto the targeted ships to serve as lures; those arranging for this to occur might be described as having committed the action in addition to those actually boarding the ships.

Although statutory prohibitions on the practice remain in jurisdictions such as the United States, the offence is effectively obsolete. The relevant law in that country dates from 1872, but the last successful prosecution under it occurred in 1890, in the case of &quot;United States v Sullivan&quot;.

==Greenpeace charge==
In April 2002 Greenpeace activists boarded the container ship APL &quot;Jade&quot;, carrying a shipment of illegal Brazilian mahogany at a Miami port, calling on President Bush to return all mahogany shipments from Brazil and to investigate companies that continue to buy it. Twelve individuals were arrested and six Greenpeace activists were charged with sailormongering and sentenced to time served.

One year later in 2003, the United States Justice Department prosecuted Greenpeace under the same 1872 statute for boarding the APL Jade that was importing over $10 million worth of Brazilian mahogany. The case garnered widespread ridicule and was dismissed on the third day of the trial, after one and a half days of testimony.

The Greenpeace Mahogany campaign ended when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed Bigleaf mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;) on Appendix II at CoP12 in Santiago, Chile.

<text>Natamycin, also known as pimaricin, is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections around the eye. This includes infections of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea. It is used as eyedrops. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a preservative.
Allergic reactions may occur. It is unclear if medical use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is in the macrolide and polyene families of medications. It results in fungal death by altering the cell membrane.
Natamycin was discovered in 1955 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is produced by fermentation of certain types of the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces&quot;.

== Uses ==

=== Medical ===

Natamycin is used to treat fungal infections, including &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, &quot;Cephalosporium&quot;, &quot;Fusarium&quot;, and &quot;Penicillium&quot;. It is applied topically as a cream, in eye drops, or (for oral infections) in a lozenge. Natamycin shows negligible absorption into the body when administered in these ways. When taken orally, little or none is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, making it inappropriate for systemic infections. Natamycin lozenges are used by veterinarians for oral thrush.

=== Food ===
Natamycin has been used for decades in the food industry as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a brine) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product.

Natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid. Natamycin is also known to diffuse slower and lesser into cheese when compared to sorbate, which could otherwise cause undesirable changes to the flavor. 

As a food additive, it has E number E235. Throughout the European Union, it is approved only as a surface preservative for certain cheese and dried sausage products. It must not be detectable 5 mm below the rind. While natamycin is approved in different applications at different levels in the world, it is approved in over 150 countries worldwide.

While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Sausages that contain cheese, even in countries that don&#x27;t allow its use on meats, may contain and list natamycin as an ingredient. 

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel took over the responsibilities of providing scientific food safety advice to the EU from the Scientific Committee on Food in 2002. In 2009, the EFSA considered the proposed use levels of natamycin are safe if it is used for the surface treatment for these cheese and sausage types.

== Safety ==

Natamycin does not have acute toxicity. In animal studies, the lowest found was 2.5-4.5 g/kg. In rats, the LD50 is ≥2300 mg/kg, and doses of 500 mg/kg/day over two years caused no detectable differences in survival rate, growth, or incidence of tumors. The metabolites of natamycin also lack toxicity. The breakdown products of natamycin under various storage conditions may have a lower LD50 than natamycin, but in all cases, the numbers are quite high. In humans, a dose of 500 mg/kg/day repeated over multiple days caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

No evidence shows natamycin, at either pharmacological levels or levels encountered as a food additive, can harm normal intestinal flora, but definitive research may not be available. However, some people are allergic to natamycin.

The EFSA has concluded that the use of natamycin as a food additive has no relevant risk for the development of resistant fungi.

== Mechanism of action ==

Natamycin inhibits the growth of fungi by specifically binding to ergosterol present in fungal cell membranes. Natamycin inhibits amino acid and glucose transport proteins leading to a loss of nutrient transport across the plasma membrane. While this binding is reversible, ergosterol binding acts as a universal mechanism of fungal inhibition, allowing natamycin to act on diverse fungal pathogens from &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; yeast to &quot;Aspergillus&quot; moulds. Natamycin is unique amongst related antifungals specifically because it does not directly cause membrane permeabilization. Structurally-related antibiotics with similar binding properties are thought to produce hydrophilic channels that allow leakage of potassium and sodium ions from the cell.

Natamycin has very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds.

== Biochemistry ==
Natamycin is produced as a secondary metabolite by some &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species: &quot;S. natalensis&quot;, &quot;S. lydicus&quot;, &quot;S. chattanoogensis&quot; and &quot;S. gilvosporeus&quot;. Structurally, its core is a macrolide containing a polyene segment, with carboxylic acid and mycosamine groups attached. As with other polyene antimycotics, the biosynthesis begins with a series of polyketide synthase modules, followed by additional enzymatic processes for oxidation and attachment of the substituents.

Natamycin is produced on an industrial scale by fermentation of various &quot;Streptomyces&quot; strains, including &quot;S. chattanoogensis&quot; L10.

== History ==
Natamycin was first isolated in 1955 from fermentation broth of a &quot;Streptomyces natalensis&quot; cell culture. It was originally named &quot;pimaricin&quot; to honor Pietermaritzburg, where &quot;Streptomyces natalensis&quot; was acquired. Pimaricin was later renamed after the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that antibiotics produced by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; end in –mycin. The name &quot;natamycin&quot; was chosen in reference to the &quot;natalensis&quot; species name.

==Society and culture==
Natamycin appears on Whole Foods&#x27; &quot;Unacceptable Ingredients for Food&quot; list.

<text>The history of creationism relates to the history of thought based on the premise that the natural universe had a beginning, and came into being supernaturally. The term &quot;creationism&quot; in its broad sense covers a wide range of views and interpretations, and was not in common use before the late 19th century. Throughout recorded history, many people have viewed the universe as a created entity. Many ancient historical accounts from around the world refer to or imply a creation of the earth and universe. Although specific historical understandings of creationism have used varying degrees of empirical, spiritual and/or philosophical investigations, they are all based on the view that the universe was created. The Genesis creation narrative has provided a basic framework for Jewish and Christian epistemological understandings of how the universe came into being – through the divine intervention of the god, Yahweh. Historically, literal interpretations of this narrative were more dominant than allegorical ones.

From the 18th century on, various views aimed at reconciling the Abrahamic religions and Genesis with geology, biology and other sciences developed in Western culture. At this time, the word creationism referred to a doctrine of creation of the soul. Those holding that species had been created in a separate act, such as Philip Gosse in 1857, were generally called &quot;advocates of creation&quot;, though they were also called &quot;creationists&quot; in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends, dating from 1856.

In the 20th century the word &quot;creationism&quot; became associated with the anti-evolution movement of the 1920s and young Earth creationism, but this usage was contested by other groups, such as old Earth creationists and evolutionary creationists, who hold different concepts of creation, such as the acceptance of the age of the Earth and biological evolution as understood by the scientific community.

&quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; (1961) became the most successful young earth creationist publication after 1945&quot;.&quot; From the mid-1960s, creationists in the United States promoted the teaching of &quot;scientific creationism&quot; using &quot;Flood geology&quot; in public school science classes. After the legal judgment of the case &quot;Daniel v. Waters&quot; (1975) ruled that teaching creationism in public schools contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the content was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed creation science. When the court case &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; (1987) ruled that creation science similarly contravened the constitution, all references to &quot;creation&quot; in a draft school textbook were changed to refer to intelligent design, which was presented by creationists as a new scientific theory. The &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover&quot; (2005) ruling concluded that intelligent design is not science and contravenes the constitutional restriction on teaching religion in public school science classes. In September 2012, Bill Nye (&quot;The Science Guy&quot;) expressed his concern that &quot;creationist views&quot; threaten science education and innovations in the United States.

==Creation and modern science==

In the 15th and 16th centuries, discoveries in new lands brought knowledge of the diversity of life. In 1605, Francis Bacon emphasized that the works of God in nature teach us how to interpret the Bible, and the Baconian method introduced the empirical approach which became central to modern science. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting an active role of God, and attempts were made to reconcile new knowledge with the biblical deluge myth and story of Noah&#x27;s Ark. The development of modern geology in the 18th and 19th centuries found geological strata and fossil sequences indicating a very ancient Earth. The diluvial cosmogonies fell victim to their own success, as the spirit of scientific inquiry they had stimulated, gradually led to discoveries that undercut the biblical premises of flood geology and catastrophism.

From around the start of the 19th century, ideas such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#x27;s concept of transmutation of species had gained supporters in Paris and Edinburgh, mostly amongst anatomists. The anonymous publication of &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; in 1844 aroused wide public interest with support from Quakers and Unitarians, but was strongly criticised by the religious establishment and the scientific community, which called for solidly backed science. In 1859, Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; provided that evidence from an authoritative and respected source, and within a decade or so convinced scientists that evolution occurs. This view clashed with that of conservative evangelicals in the Church of England, but in 1860 their attention turned to the much greater uproar about &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; by liberal Anglican theologians, which introduced &quot;higher criticism&quot;, a hermeneutic method re-examining the Bible and questioning literal readings. By 1875 most American naturalists supported ideas of theistic evolution, often involving special creation of human beings.

At this time those holding that species had been separately created were generally called &quot;advocates of creation,&quot; but they were occasionally called &quot;creationists&quot; in private correspondence between Charles Darwin and his friends. The term appears in letters Darwin wrote between 1856 and 1863, and was also used in a response by Charles Lyell.

By this time, geologists recognised that the Earth was millions of years old. The exact chronology proposed by Darwin was disputed by other geologists, and the leading physicist William Thomson (later ennobled as Lord Kelvin) produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of the Earth and Sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution. Thomson&#x27;s colleague Fleeming Jenkin wrote an 1867 review of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; which opposed evolution on the basis of the shortened time available. Kelvin&#x27;s age paradox was not resolved until it was discovered in the 20th century that the Earth is heated by radioactive decay, that its internal thermal gradient is affected by mantle convection, and that the Sun is heated by nuclear fusion.

Since the 1980s, the big-bang theory has been the prevailing cosmological model for the universe. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor Georges Lemaître in the 1930s. Lemaître suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a &quot;primeval atom&quot; where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence. However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal steady state. After Lemaître proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics. When the expression &quot;Big Bang&quot; was coined by Fred Hoyle in 1949, he meant it to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lemaître himself concluded that an initial &quot;creation-like&quot; event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the Roman Catholic concept of creation. Under the Anthropic principle, by which the properties of the universe is seemingly fine-tuned for our own existence, some Christians see evidence that a divine creator has purposefully designed the universe.

==Pre-scientific era==
===Early history===
David Sedley, in his book &quot;Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity&quot;, traces creationist thought to the presocratic thinkers Anaxagoras and Empedocles, in the 5th century BCE. Sedley states that Anaxagoras was recognized by Plato as &quot;the first overt champion of a creative cosmic intelligence&quot;. Anaxagoras&#x27;s theory was that the original state of the world was a roughly even mixture of all opposites, and that it was the effect of the action of &quot;nous&quot; (intelligence or mind) that led to the partial separation of such opposites, hot from cold, land from water, rarefied from dense. Anaxagoras also developed the philosophical innovation of dualism of mind from matter, diverging from the stringent monism of his predecessor, Parmenides. Empedocles proposed a system whereby two competing divine forces, Love (harmony and blending) and Strife (separation) had alternating dominion over the universe and the four elements, earth, water, air and fire.

Around 45 BCE, Cicero made a teleological argument that anticipated the watchmaker analogy, in &quot;De natura deorum&quot;, ii. 34
:When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers? (Gjertsen 1989, p. 199, quoted by Dennett 1995, p. 29)

170 – Galen, Stoic Roman physician wrote against creation beliefs in &quot;On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body&quot;, 11.14:
:It is precisely this point in which our own opinion and that of Plato and of the other Greeks who follow the right method in natural science differ from the position taken up by Moses. For the latter it seems enough to say that God simply willed the arrangement of matter and it was presently arranged in due order; for he believes everything to be possible with God, even should he wish to make a bull or a horse out of ashes. We, however, do not hold this; we say that certain things are impossible by nature and that God does not even attempt such things at all but that he [sic] chooses the best out of the possibility of becoming.

In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote &quot;The Literal Meaning of Genesis&quot; in which he argued that Genesis should be interpreted as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing to change their minds about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.

610–632 – Muhammad reports receiving the Qur&#x27;an by divine revelation. The Qur&#x27;an holds many of the core concepts of creationism, including a 6-day creation, Adam and Eve, Enoch, and Noah&#x27;s ark, but also provides some details absent from Genesis, including reference to a fourth son of Noah who chose not to enter the ark. Through Islam, creation beliefs and monotheism replace paganism among the Arabs.

===Renaissance and protoscience===
The Renaissance starting in the 14th century saw the establishment of protoscience that eventually became modern science. This was a period of great social change.

The Protestant Reformation introduced lay people reading the Bible in translation and more literal understandings, and led to a new belief that every biological species had been individually created by God.

====Protoscience====
The Baconian method introduced the empirical scientific method. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting Christianity.

Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s idea of Heliocentrism was proposed in the 16th century and established by Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler and Newton. This overturned the Greek Ptolemaic system of geocentrism, which had been adopted as Church dogma with the fusion of Christianity with Greek Philosophy in the first few centuries CE.

The English naturalist John Ray (1627–1705) is sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history. As well as collecting and classifying plants, he wrote two books entitled &quot;The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation&quot; (1691), and &quot;Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World&quot; (1692), which included essays on &quot;The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World&quot;, &quot;The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects&quot;, and &quot;The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations&quot;. In &quot;The Wisdom of God&quot; he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature (the teleological argument), such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness of the bones, the camel&#x27;s stomach and the hedgehog&#x27;s armor.

In April 1630, Descartes wrote three letters to the father Mersenne, which exposed for the first time his Creation Doctrine. Descartes affirmed God creates the eternal truths and the material and extended world with a uninterrupted, free and voluntaristic work. This conception was subsequently developed in the fifth and Sixth Replies to the objections to his &quot;meditations&quot;. Descartes was influenced by the Francisco Suarez&#x27;s view on primitivism and divine realism, for which the connections between properties of the real world (e.g. &#x27;being a man&#x27; and &#x27;being an animal&#x27;) belong immutably to the essence and intellect of God the Creator from ever and forever, and therefore aren&#x27;t created by Him.
Carl Linnaeus, in the 18th century, established a system of classification of species by similarity. At the time, the system of classification was seen as the plan of organization used by God in his creation. Later, the theory of evolution applied it as groundwork for the idea of common descent.

====Religious arguments====
In 1650 the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, James Ussher, published a monumental history of the world from creation to 70 A.D. He used the recorded genealogies and ages in the bible to derive what is commonly known as the Ussher chronology. This calculated a date for creation at 4004 BCE. The date was widely accepted in the English-speaking world.

In 1696, William Whiston published &quot;A New Theory of the Earth&quot;, in which he proposed an account of the creation of the world. He grounded his argument in the following three &quot;Postulata&quot;:
:1) The obvious or literal sense of scripture is the true and real one, where no evidence can be given to the contrary.
:2) That which is clearly accountable in a natural way, is not, without reason to be ascribed to a miraculous power.
:3) What ancient tradition asserts of the constitution of nature, or of the origin and primitive states of the world, is to be allowed for true, where ‘tis fully agreeable to scripture, reason, and philosophy.
Whiston was the first to propose that the global flood was caused by the water in the tail of a comet.

The English divine William Derham (1657–1735) published his &quot;Artificial Clockmaker&quot; in 1696 and &quot;Physico-Theology&quot; in 1713. These books were teleological arguments for the being and attributes of God, and were used by Paley nearly a century later.

The Watchmaker analogy was put by Bernard Nieuwentyt (1730) and referred to several times by Paley. A charge of wholesale plagiarism from this book was brought against Paley in the Athenaeum for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt, and had been appropriated by many others before Paley.

David Hume (1711–1776), a Scottish naturalist, empiricist, and skeptic, argued for naturalism and against belief in God. He argued that order stems from both design and natural processes, so it is not necessary to infer a designer when one sees order; that the design argument, even if it worked, would not support a robust or even moral God, that the argument begged the question of the origin of God, and that design was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. For philosopher James D. Madden, it is &quot;Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition&quot;.

==Scientific era==

===Modern geology and gap theory===

James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Based upon a detailed examination of what we now recognise as the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere he showed that the present forces seen on the earth were sufficient to explain all the phenomena observed. He wrote &quot;The Mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great distance; and there has not been found, in natural history, any document by which a high antiquity can be attributed to the human race. But this is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals, particularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shorees. We find in natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long existed; and thus we thus preocure a measure for the computation of time extremely remote though far from being precisely ascertained.&quot; Based upon these principles of uniformitarianism, he demonstrated that the Earth is much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediment to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. The presumption that the world was only 6,000 years old was scientifically abandoned as a result of Hutton&#x27;s work.

This development of the scientific discipline of geology, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the discovery that the Earth was far older than a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis could account for, led to the development, and popularity, of the &quot;Gap Theory&quot; (now known as gap creationism) to accommodate these discoveries. Gap Theory assumes a recent six-day creation, but also that the Earth existed for many ages before this event, ending in cataclysm and a new creation (hence its alternative title &#x27;ruin-restoration theory&#x27;).

In the early 19th century, &quot;a heterogeneous group of writers,&quot; known as scriptural geologists, arose to oppose these discoveries, and the Gap Theory. Their views were marginalised and ignored by the scientific community of their time. They &quot;had much the same relationship to &#x27;philosophical&#x27; (or scientific) geologists as their indirect descendants, the twentieth-century creationists.&quot; Paul Wood describes them as &quot;mostly Anglican evangelicals&quot; with &quot;no institutional focus and little sense of commonality.&quot; They generally lacked any background in geology, and had little influence even in church circles.

From 1830 to 1833, the geologist and clergyman Sir Charles Lyell released a three volume publication called &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, which developed Hutton&#x27;s ideas of uniformitarianism, and in the second volume set out a gradualist variation of creation beliefs in which each species had its &quot;centre of creation&quot; and was designed for the habitat, but would become extinct when the habitat changed. John Herschel supported this gradualist view and wrote to Lyell urging a search for natural laws underlying the &quot;mystery of mysteries&quot; of how species formed.

In 1857, Philip Henry Gosse published &quot;Omphalos: Untying the Geological Knot&quot;. The Omphalos hypothesis argued that the World had been created by God recently, but with the appearance of old age. This was largely ignored, and some considered it blasphemous because it accused the Creator of deceit. Some young Earth creationists would later incorporate parts of his arguments.

===Pre-Darwinian biology===
Erasmus Darwin published his Zoönomia between 1794 and 1796 foreshadowing Lamarck&#x27;s ideas on evolution, and even suggesting &quot;that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality ... possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity.&quot;

Advances in paleontology, led by William Smith, saw the recording of the first fossil records that showed the transmutation of species. Then, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot; of 1809, a theory of evolution, later known as Lamarckism, by which traits that were &quot;needed&quot; were passed on.
In 1802, William Paley published &quot;Natural Theology&quot; in response to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient teleological argument (or argument from design) to argue for the existence of God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonably infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.

The official eight &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot; &quot;On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation&quot; included the Reverend William Buckland&#x27;s 1836 &quot;Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot; setting out the logic of day-age, gap theory, and theistic evolution.
The computing pioneer Charles Babbage then published his unofficial &quot;Ninth Bridgewater Treatise&quot; in 1837, putting forward a thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) that then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with &quot;ad hoc&quot; miracles each time a new species was required.

By 1836 the anatomist Richard Owen had theories influenced by Johannes Peter Müller that living matter had an &quot;organising energy,&quot; a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. In the 1850s Owen developed ideas of &quot;archetypes&quot; in the divine mind producing a sequence of species in &quot;ordained continuous becoming&quot; in which new species appeared at birth.

Late in 1844 the anonymous publication of &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; popularised the idea of divinely ordered development of everything from stellar evolution to transmutation of species. It quickly gained fashionable success in court circles and aroused interest in all sections of society. It also aroused religious controversy, and after initially being slow to respond, the scientific establishment attacked the book. It continued to be a best seller to around the end of the century.

Herbert Spencer was a 19th-century English philosopher who developed ideas about the unifying concept of evolution across the natural and social sciences. Spencer is the first to develop a theory of cultural evolution and is considered by some to be the father of Social Darwinism. It is also he and not Darwin who coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Much of the positivist ideas of progress that dominated the social science philosophy of Spencer and subsequent Social Darwinists has been criticized by present-day sociologists, but such ideas continue to be one of the major critiques made by creationists against evolution in general, even though strict biological evolution does not depend on it nor offer any type of endorsement of so-called &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; or its derivative philosophies such as eugenics.

==Age of Darwin==

The decades following Charles Darwin&#x27;s publication of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, in 1859, saw the overwhelming majority of North American and British naturalists accept some form of evolution, with many liberal and educated churchmen following their example, and thereby rejecting a biblically literalist interpretation of Genesis. Although Darwin&#x27;s work rejected &quot;the dogma of separate creations,&quot; he invoked creation as the probable source of the first lifeforms (&quot;into which life was first breathed&quot;). This led Asa Gray, who was both religiously orthodox, and Darwin&#x27;s most prominent American supporter, to suggest that Darwin had accepted &quot;a supernatural beginning of life on earth&quot; and that he should therefore allow a second &quot;special origination&quot; for humanity. Darwin however rejected this view, and used uncompromisingly naturalistic language in place of biblical idiom, starting with &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; in 1871.

Darwin&#x27;s book caused less controversy than he had feared, as the idea of evolution had been widely popularized in Victorian Britain by the 1844 publication of &quot;Vestiges of Creation&quot;. However, it posed fundamental questions about the relationship between religion and science. Though &quot;Origin&quot; did not explicitly deal with human evolution, the jump was one both supporters and opponents of the theory immediately made, and the idea that man was simply an animal (common descent) who had evolved a particular set of characteristics — rather than a spiritual being created by God — continued to be one of the most divisive notions of the 19th century. One of the most famous disputes was the Oxford Debate of 1860, in which T.H. Huxley, Darwin&#x27;s self-appointed &quot;bulldog,&quot; debated evolution with Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford. Both sides claimed victory, then the controversy was overshadowed by the even greater theological furore over the publication of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; questioning whether miracles were atheistic, bringing to a head arguments in the Church of England between liberal theologians supporting higher criticism, and conservative Evangelicals. The essays were described by their opponents as heretical, and the essayists were called &quot;The Seven Against Christ.&quot;

In 1862, the Glaswegian physicist William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) published calculations, based on his presumption of uniformitarianism, and that the heat of the Sun was caused by its gravitational shrinkage, that fixed the age of the Earth and the Solar System at between 20 million and 400 million years, i.e. between ~3,000 and ~70,000 times Ussher&#x27;s value. This came as a blow to Darwin&#x27;s anticipated timescale, though the idea of an ancient Earth was generally accepted without much controversy. Darwin and Huxley, while not accepting the timing, said it merely implied faster evolution. It would take further advances in geology and the discovery of radioactivity that showed that the Sun was in fact heated by nuclear fusion that demonstrated the present estimated 4.567 billion years, or ~700,000 times Ussher&#x27;s value. A way to measure the age of the universe would be discovered by Edwin Hubble in the 1930s, but due to observational constraints, an accurate measurement of the Hubble constant would not be forthcoming until the late 1990s. According to the ESA/Planck data, released in March 2013, the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years or some ~2,000,000 times Ussher&#x27;s value.

The Swiss-American paleontologist Louis Agassiz opposed evolution. He believed that there had been a series of catastrophes with divine re-creations, evidence of which could be seen in rock fossils. Though uniformitarianism dominated ideas from the 1840s onwards, Catastrophism remained a major paradigm in geology until replaced by new models that allowed for both cataclysms (such as meteor strikes) and gradualist patterns (such as ice ages) to explain observed geologic phenomena.

In 1878, American Presbyterians held the first annual Niagara Bible Conference, founding the Christian fundamentalist movement, which took its name from the &quot;Five Fundamentals&quot; of 1910, and came to be concerned about the implications of evolution for the accuracy of the Bible. But by no means all orthodox Presbyterians were opposed to evolution as a possible method of the Divine procedure. Dr Charles Hodge of Princeton Seminary objected in 1874 to the atheism he considered inplied in the naturalistic explanation but both he and Dr B. B. Warfield were open to its possibility/probability within limits, and most churchmen sought to reconcile Darwinism with Christianity.

Darwin died in 1882. In 1915, Elizabeth Cotton, Lady Hope, spread rumors that he had repented and accepted God on his deathbed. Lady Hope&#x27;s story is almost certainly false, and it is unlikely that she visited Darwin as she claimed.

==Early 20th century==
In the 1920s, the term &quot;creationism&quot; became particularly associated with a Christian fundamentalist movement opposed to the idea of human evolution, which succeeded in getting teaching of evolution banned in United States public schools. From the mid-1960s young Earth creationism proposed &quot;scientific creationism&quot; using &quot;Flood geology&quot; as support for a literal reading of Genesis. After legal judgements that teaching this in public schools contravened constitutional separation of Church and State, it was stripped of biblical references and called creation science, then when this was ruled unacceptable, intelligent design was coined.

The decades before the start of the 20th century, and the first decades of that century, have been described as the eclipse of Darwinism. Darwin&#x27;s work had quickly established scientific consensus that evolution occurred, but there was considerable disagreement about the mechanisms involved, and few gave as much significance to natural selection as Darwin himself. Evolution itself was assumed, but the &quot;mechanism&quot; of how it happened was in considerable debate, and none had anything near to a consensus. Among these theories were neo-Lamarckism (which merged certain aspects of Lamarck&#x27;s theory of acquired characteristics with certain aspects of Darwinian evolution), orthogenesis (&quot;straight-line&quot; evolution, which talked about evolution towards a specific goal by forces within the organism), and the discontinuous variation of Mendelism and Hugo De Vries&#x27; mutation theory. Some of these alternative theories, in particular neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, allowed more easily for an interpretation of the intervention of God, which appealed to many scientists at the time. The term &quot;Darwinism&quot; had covered a wide range of ideas, many of which differed from Darwin&#x27;s views, but it became associated with the minority view of August Weismann who went further than Darwin by rejecting inheritance of acquired characters and attributing all evolution to natural selection, a view also called neo-Darwinism. By the first decades of the 20th century, the debate had become generally one between continuous-variation biometricians and discontinuous-variety Mendelians. In the 1930s and 1940s, though, they were combined with natural selection into the modern evolutionary synthesis, which soon became the dominant model in the scientific community. This model has also been called Darwinism and neo-Darwinism.

George McCready Price was important in developing &quot;flood geology&quot;, and while he had limited influence at a time when all geologists had long accepted an ancient earth, many of his ideas that a young earth could be deduced from science were taken up later. Price was a Seventh-day Adventist, and followed one of the founders of the church, Ellen White, in seeing fossils as evidence of the Great Flood. In 1906, Price published &quot;Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory&quot; in which he offered $1000 &quot;to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another.&quot;

===United States===

In 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church distilled the principles of Christian fundamentalism into what were known as the &quot;five fundamentals,&quot; one of which was the inerrancy of the Scriptures, including the Genesis account of creation. &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; were published as a series of essays. Its authors accepted ancient earth geology, while holding different ideas about how this was reconciled with biblical accounts. The views expressed on evolution were mixed: two short articles were anti evolution, one anonymous and one by the little-known Henry Beach. Their focus was on human evolution, as were attacks made on evolution by Dyson Hague. Major figures were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through a Lamarckian form of evolution: long articles by James Orr and George Frederick Wright expressed this openness, and Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield and A H Strong shared this view.

After the First World War (1914–1918), the teaching of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught the theory of evolution as scientific fact. Many Christians in the US and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free exercise of religion, as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false.

For example, the Democratic Party politician William Jennings Bryan &quot;became convinced that the teaching of Evolution as a fact caused the students to lose faith in the Bible, first, in the story of creation, and later in other doctrines, which underlie the Christian religion.&quot;

During the First World War, reports of horrors committed by Germans, who were citizens of one of the most scientifically advanced countries in the World, led Bryan to state &quot;The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible.&quot;

A popular book published in 1917 by Stanford University professor and entomologist Vernon L. Kellogg entitled &quot;Headquarters Nights&quot;, drew a direct association between German war ideology and Darwinian description of nature as a struggle. Kellogg was a leading authority on evolution of insects, and had published &quot;Darwinism Today&quot; in 1907. His anti-Darwinian and anti-German rhetoric in &quot;Headquarters Nights&quot; influenced biologists who tried to play down the negative implications of &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot;

Benjamin Kidd&#x27;s 1918 book &quot;Science of Power&quot;, claimed that there were historical and philosophical connections between Darwinism and German militarism. This book and others around this time had an effect on many people.

In 1922, William Jennings Bryan published &quot;In His Image&quot;, in which he argued that Darwinism was both irrational and immoral. On the former point, he pointed to examples such as the eye, which he argued could not be explained by Darwinian evolution. On the latter point, he argued that Darwinism advocated the policy of &quot;scientific breeding&quot; or eugenics, by which the strong were to weed out the weak, a policy that directly contradicts the Christian doctrine of charity to the helpless.

In 1923, fundamentalist preacher and evangelist William Bell Riley, known as &quot;The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism,&quot; founded the Anti-Evolution League of Minnesota, which, in 1924, became the Anti-Evolution League of America. The organization was behind anti-evolution legislation in Kentucky, where its efforts were supported by William Jennings Bryan.

In 1924, Clarence Darrow defended Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb on the charge of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks; his defense included an argument that &quot;this terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor.&quot;

In the 1920s and 1930s, Harry Rimmer was one of the most prominent American creationists. Known as the &quot;noisiest evangelist in America,&quot; he published many creationist tracts, debated other creationists and was involved in a famous trial known as the &quot;Floyd-Rimmer trial&quot; against the atheist William Floyd.

In 1925, G. K. Chesterton published &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;, in which he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical underpinnings and perceived logical flaws of evolution.

The Scopes Trial of 1925 is perhaps the most famous court case of its kind. The Butler Act had prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools in Tennessee. Clarence Darrow was the defense counsel, and William Jennings Bryan was the prosecutor. Bryan appealed for assistance to George McCready Price, Johns Hopkins University physician Howard A. Kelly, physicist Louis T. More, and Alfred W. McCann, all of whom had written books supporting creationism. Price was away in England, Kelly and More told Bryan they considered themselves more convinced by evolution, and McCann was not interested because of Bryan&#x27;s stance on prohibition. Nevertheless, a schoolteacher named John T. Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution and fined, although the case was later dismissed on a technicality.

Following up on the Butler Act, antievolutionary laws were passed in Mississippi in 1926, and then in Arkansas in 1928. However, the 1928 election and the onset of the Depression changed the playing field. Creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school boards, having substantial success. They set themselves to the tasks of &quot;the emasculation of textbooks, the &#x27;purging&#x27; of libraries, and above all the, continued hounding of teachers.&quot; Discussions of evolution vanished from almost all schoolbooks. By 1941, about one third of American teachers were afraid of being accused of supporting evolution.

In 1929, a book by one of George McCready Price&#x27;s former students, Harold W. Clark described Price&#x27;s catastrophism as &quot;creationism&quot; in &quot;Back to Creationism&quot;. Previously anti-evolutionists had described themselves as being &quot;Christian fundamentalists&quot; &quot;Anti-evolution&quot; or &quot;Anti-false science.&quot; The term creationism had previously referred to the creation of souls for each new person, as opposed to traducianism, where souls were said to have been inherited from one&#x27;s parents.

In 1933, a group of atheists seeking to develop a &quot;new religion&quot; to replace previous, deity-based religions, composed the Humanist Manifesto, which outlined a fifteen-point belief system, the first two points of which provided that &quot;Religious humanists regard the universe as self-existing and not created&quot; and &quot;Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process.&quot; This document exacerbated the ideological tone of the discussion in many circles, as many creationists came to see evolution as a doctrine of the &quot;religion&quot; of atheism.

In 1935, the &quot;Religion and Science Association&quot; was formed by a small group of creationists, led by a Wheaton College professor, to form &quot;a unified front against the theory of evolution.&quot; There were three main schools of creationist thought, represented by Price, Rimmer, and tidal expert William Bell Dawson. However, since Dawson was a proponent of day-age creationism and Rimmer was ardently convinced that gap creationism was correct, the staunch supporters of a literal 6 day creation and 6000-year-old earth were incensed, and the organization fell apart.

Price and his supporters retreated to California, and with several doctors working at the College of Medical Evangelists (now Loma Linda University), formed the &quot;Deluge Geology Society.&quot; The &quot;Deluge Geology Society&quot; published the &quot;Bulletin of Deluge Geology and Related Science&quot; from 1941 to 1945. They made secret plans to unveil discoveries of fossils of human footprints that were in rock that was purportedly older than accounted for in evolutionary theory. However, again the organization foundered over disagreements about a 6000 year old earth.

Price was particularly strident in his attacks against fellow creationists. His friend and former student Harold W. Clark had earned a master&#x27;s degree in biology from the University of California, Berkeley, and felt that Price&#x27;s book &quot;New Geology&quot; was &quot;entirely out of date and inadequate.&quot; Unfortunately, Price responded angrily when he found out, accusing Clark of suffering from &quot;the modern mental disease of universityitis&quot; and of falling in with the &quot;tobacco-smoking, Sabbath-breaking. God-defying&quot; evolutionists. Clark pleaded with Price that he still believed in a 6 day creation and a young earth and a universal flood, but Price responded with a vitriolic publication entitled &quot;Theories of Satanic Origin&quot; about Clark and his views.

The American George Gaylord Simpson argued that the paleontological record supported evolution in the 1940s. Some creationists, however, objected to his supposed equation of microevolution and macroevolution, acknowledging the former but denying the latter, and continue to do so to this day.

==Post-war==

===United States===

The Second World War (1939–1945) saw the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust. American creationist explanation for the Holocaust is that it had been driven in part by eugenics, or the principle that individuals with &quot;undesirable&quot; genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool. Eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory, though many biologists had long opposed it. Although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war, the memory of it did not quickly fade, and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the Nazis.

Fissures within the creationist community, which had always been present, continued to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences. Geochemist J. Laurence Kulp had gone to the evangelical school Wheaton College for his undergraduate degree and was a Plymouth Brother. He obtained a PhD from Princeton before taking a faculty position at Columbia. He felt it was his duty to warn fellow Christians in the evangelical scientific organization the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) of the problems with Price&#x27;s claims. Kulp wrote a review of Price&#x27;s work, in which he stated that &quot;major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws&quot; in 1950. This caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an affiliation of Christians who are also scientists, causing many to claim that Kulp had been contaminated with &quot;the orthodox geological viewpoint&quot; and this was responsible for his faith in the Bible being badly shaken. Kulp&#x27;s influence, however, continues today within the American Scientific Affiliation, which continues to support old earth creationism.

In the 1950s the United States slid into a Cold War with the communist Soviet Union, its former ally. Communism had as one of its principles atheism. Americans divided over the issues of Communism and atheism, but with the Great Purge, Cultural Revolution and 1956 Hungarian Uprising, many became concerned about the implications of Communism and atheism. At the same time, the scientific community was making great strides in developing the theory of evolution, which seemed to make belief in God unreasonable under Occam&#x27;s razor. The American shock and panic about the 1957 Sputnik launch led to the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to reform American science curricula. This resulted in the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, also begun in 1958 and with the goal of writing new up-to-date biology textbooks. These new biology textbooks included a discussion of the theory of evolution. Within a few years, half of American schools were using the new BSCS biology textbooks. In addition, the hundredth anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; was in 1959, and this sparked renewed public interest in evolutionary biology. The creationist fervor of the past seemed like ancient history. A historian at Oklahoma&#x27;s Northeastern State University, R. Halliburton, even made a prediction in 1964 that &quot;a renaissance of the [creationist] movement is most unlikely.&quot;

In 1961, Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb, Jr published a book entitled &quot;The Genesis Flood,&quot; in an effort to provide a scientific basis for young earth creationism and Flood geology. Morris had published several books previously, but none had the impact that &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; did. Its publication resulted in ten like-minded creationists forming the Creation Research Society in 1963, and the Institute for Creation Research in 1972.

In 1968, the US Supreme Court ruled in Epperson vs. Arkansas that a 1928 act forbidding the teaching of human evolution violated the Establishment Clause of the US constitution. This clause lays out the Separation of church and state in the United States and states that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or restricting the free exercise thereof.&quot;

In 1970, creationists in California established the Institute for Creation Research, to &quot;meet the need for an organization devoted to research, publication, and teaching in those fields of science particularly relevant to the study of origins.&quot;

In 1973, a famous anti-young earth creationist essay by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky was published in the &quot;American Biology Teacher&quot; entitled &quot;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution&quot;. He argued that evolution was not incompatible with a belief in God nor a belief in the accuracy of scriptures.

In 1975, in Daniel v. Waters, the U.S. Sixth Circuit of Appeals struck down Tennessee&#x27;s &quot;equal time&quot; law that any biology textbook which discussed human origins must give equal emphasis to the Biblical account.

In 1978 the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy developed the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, which denies &quot;that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood.&quot;

In 1980, Walt Brown became director of the Center for Scientific Creation.

In 1981, the San Diego–based fundamentalist group the Creation Science Research Center claimed, in a trial dubbed the &quot;Monkey Trial Replay,&quot; that teaching evolution as the sole theory of development violated the rights of children who believed in biblical creation. In his opening statement for the group lawyer Richard Turner argued:

It is not a showdown at high noon between creation and evolution. It is not religion versus science. We are not trying to sneak the Bible into the classroom, or any other religious doctrine. The real issue here is that of religious freedom under the United States Constitution.

Turner went on to explain that the plaintiffs were seeking protection for the belief that &quot;God created man as man, not as a blob.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; of 7 March 1981 reported that some were of the opinion that the case was &quot;a signal of things to come, with more and more fundamentalist groups trying to flex their not inconsiderable influence in schools across the country.&quot; At the same time Frank D. White, the Governor of Arkansas signed a Bill requiring that creation science and the theory of evolution be given equal weight in schools. Although fifteen states attempted to introduce such Bills around this time, only that in Arkansas made it into law. Following hearings in Little Rock the law was overturned by Judge William Overton early in 1982, just as a similar (and equally unsuccessful) Bills were approved by legislators in Mississippi and Louisiana.

Carl Baugh established the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas, in 1984. Kent Hovind&#x27;s Young Earth Creationist ministry was founded in 1989.

In 1986, another creationist organization called &quot;Reasons to Believe&quot; was established. Unlike most current creationist organizations, RTB supports Old Earth creationism.

In 1987, the US Supreme Court again ruled, this time in Edwards v. Aguillard, that requiring the teaching of &quot;creation science&quot; every time evolution was taught illegally advanced a particular religion, although a variety of views on origins could be taught in public schools if shown to have a basis in science. The court gave a clear definition of science, and further ruled that so-called &quot;creation science&quot; was simply creationism wrongly using a contrived dualism to assert that any evidence against evolution would prove Creation. Later that year, drafts of the creation science school textbook &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; were revised to change all references to &quot;creation&quot; to relate to &quot;intelligent design.&quot;

In 1989, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics published &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon, editor Charles Thaxton, with the definition that &quot;Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc.&quot; The publisher got church groups and Christian radio to campaign for state textbook approval, with a petition in Alabama urging that &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; be presented as an alternative to evolution, and their attorney arguing that it did not compel belief in the supernatural and was not a creationist text. After setbacks it focussed efforts &quot;outside the schools&quot; to prompt grass-roots activity from local school boards, teacher&#x27;s groups and parents.

In 1990, law professor Phillip E. Johnson set out his argument that the ground rules of science as presented at Edwards v. Aguillard unfairly disqualified creationist explanations by excluding the supernatural, and in 1991, he brought out a book entitled &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot;, challenging the principles of naturalism and uniformitarianism in contemporary scientific philosophy.

In March 1992, a symposium at Southern Methodist University in Dallas provided the public debut for a small group that included Phillip Johnson, Stephen C. Meyer, William Dembski, and Michael Behe, initiating the wedge strategy that Johnson claims to have worked out by 1991.

The 1993 second edition of the school textbook &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; added a section by Michael Behe making the argument he later called irreducible complexity.

The 1990s saw the rise of intelligent design, which maintains that intelligent intervention was necessary for evolution and in other ways seeks to create doubt about the validity and feasibility of evolution, and to change the scientific method so that supernatural explanations are accepted.

In 1994, the court case Peloza v. Capistrano School District was decided against a teacher who claimed that his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion was violated by the school district&#x27;s requirement to teach evolution.

In 1996, the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, was founded to promote Intelligent design, and entered public discourse with the publication of &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot; by Michael Behe, arguing for evidence of Irreducible complexity. Critics claimed that this was a thinly veiled attempt to promote creationism, particularly in light of Edwards v. Aguillard. The Discovery Institute rejects the term creationism, which it defines narrowly as meaning young earth creationism, though in court intelligent design was found to be creationism.

In October 1999 the Michael Polanyi Center was founded in the science faculty of Baylor University, a Baptist college, to study intelligent design. A year later was disbanded amidst faculty complaints that the center had been established without consulting them, and would cause the school to be associated with pseudoscience.

In December 2001, the United States Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which contained the following statement of policy, called the Santorum Amendment, authored by Johnson:
:&quot;The Conferees recognize that a quality scientific education should prepare students to distinguish the data and testable theories of science from religious or philosophical claims that are made in the name of science. Where topics are taught that may generate controversy (such as biological evolution), the curriculum should help students to understand the full range of scientific views that exist, why such topics may generate controversy, and how scientific discoveries can profoundly affect society.&quot; 

In December 2001, Dembski established the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design.

Answers In Creation was established in 2003 to provide answers to young earth creation organizations. They claim that the young earth position is unscientific, and through their website they claim to provide proof against young earth creation science. They are anti-young earth, and promote Christianity by endorsing old earth creationism.

In 2004 Ohio adopted education standards sympathetic to intelligent design promoted by the Discovery Institute. In February 2006 the Ohio Board of Education voted to drop the Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;Critical Analysis of Evolution&quot; intelligent design lesson plan after the 2005 ruling against intelligent design in Kitzmiller v. Dover and revelations that the lesson plan was adopted despite warnings from the Ohio Department of Education, whose experts described it as wrong and misleading.

In May 2005, the Kansas school board held the Kansas evolution hearings. The court-style hearings were promoted by the Discovery Institute and attended by its Fellows and other intelligent design advocates but not by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court. The result of the hearings was the adoption by the Republican-dominated board of new science standards that relied upon the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan employing the institute&#x27;s Teach the Controversy approach, despite these having been rejected by the State Board Science Hearing Committee. With the 2006 ouster of the majority of the conservative board members, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum that removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science in February 2007.

In 2005, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled on the case of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District that intelligent design was religious in nature, a form of creationism, not scientific and thus violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The ruling barred the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classrooms for that district, but the &#x27;Dover trial&#x27; as it came to be known, has had far-reaching effects. Around the same time as the Kiztmiller ruling, many state legislators were considering bills promoted by the Discovery Institute supporting the teaching of intelligent design. Most were rejected in the light of the ruling in Dover trial out of what has been called the &quot;Dover-effect.&quot;

In September 2012, Bill Nye (&quot;The Science Guy&quot;) warned that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in the United States. (Bill Nye video)

<text>Tourism Malaysia or Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB) is an agency under the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Malaysia.

Tourism Malaysia, formerly known as the &quot;Tourist Development Corporation of Malaysia (TDC)&quot;, was established on 10 August 1972. It was then under the former Ministry of Trade and Industry.

== History ==
The Tourist Development Corporation of Malaysia (TDC) was established on 10 August 1972 as an agency under the former Ministry of Trade and Industry by an Act of Parliament.
With the inception of the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism on 20 May 1987, TDC was moved to this new ministry; and became the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB) through the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board Act 1992. Popularly known as Tourism Malaysia, its full focus is on promoting Malaysia domestically and internationally.
Tourism Malaysia now has 34 overseas and 11 marketing representative offices.

== Promotional efforts ==
In September 2006, Tourism Malaysia signed a £2 million deal with Manchester United in an effort to promote Visit Malaysia Year 2007. Prior to that, Tourism Malaysia had a deal with Chelsea F.C. The success of the Visit Malaysia Year 2007, a celebration of Malaysia&#x27;s diverse cultures, beautiful holiday locations and unique attractions has helped propel the country to the forefront in tourism. Tourism Malaysia sponsored the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League in 2009.

In 2010, Tourism Malaysia announced that it would be making greater efforts to attract New Zealanders. &quot;Initiatives include a greater focus on ecotourism, major cultural events and activities for young urban professionals. Family-friendly destinations, wellness activities, value for money and a safe, clean environment are some the key drivers of this market,&quot; said Ng.

The government has started a campaign called &quot;1Malaysia Green, 1Malaysia Clean&quot; in order to let tour operators and travelers understand the need to protect nature areas while promoting eco-tourism.

In 2016, Tourism Malaysia stated &#x27;Besides mass tourists, we are also trying to focus on niche tourism products such as sports including motoring and others, golfing, bird watching, medical and wellness as well as shopping.&#x27; Shopping brings in the highest revenue share at 30 per cent of total tourism revenue in 2015.

<text>Pahlavuni (; classical orthography: Պահլաւունի) was an Armenian noble family, a branch of the Kamsarakan, that rose to prominence in the late 10th century during the last years of the Bagratuni monarchy.

==Origins==
The Pahlavunis (also spelled Pahlavounis) were an offshoot of the Kamsarakan noble house, which had ceased to exist as a result of a failed uprising against the Arab rule in Armenia, in the late 8th century. In 774 the nature of the Arab rule had provoked the Armenian nakharars into a major rebellion which included the Kamsarakans. The defeat of the rebels at the Battle of Bagrevand in April 775 was followed by ruthless suppression of opposition in the years that followed. The power and influence of the Kamsarakans along with other leading nakharar houses such as the Mamikonians and the Gnunis was destroyed for good. Those that survived were either exiles in the Byzantine Empire or dependants of other houses, chiefly the Artsruni and the Bagratuni. They were forced to sell their hereditary principalities to the Bagratunis, such as the regions of Shirak and Arsharunik. The Bagratuni Prince Ashot the Carnivorous bought the former estates of the Kamsarakan family around Arpa River near Mren, 34 km south of Ani which was also a Bagratuni possession.

==Branches==
In the 11th century the Pahlavunis controlled and built various fortresses throughout Armenia such as Amberd and Bjni and played a significant role in all the affairs of the country. According to Cyril Toumanoff, following the abdication in 1045-46 of Prince Gregory II (who received from the court of Constantinople the rank of &quot;magistros&quot; and the office of duke of Mesopotamia, Vaspurakan, and Taron) in favor of the emperor, the Pahlavunis, under Oshin of Gandzak, moved to Cilician Armenia, forming the House of Hethumids. Toumanoff also names the Zakarid-Mxargrzeli house as branch of the Pahlavunis.

==Monastic constructions==
===Church of St Gregory of the Abughamrents===
The church of St Gregory of the Abughamrents in Ani was dedicated by the Pahlavunis and probably dates from the late 10th century. It was built as a private chapel for the Pahlavuni family. Their mausoleum, built in 1040 and now reduced to its foundations, was constructed against the northern side of the church. The church has a centralised plan, with a dome over a drum, and the interior has six exedera. The church has an inscription by Vahram Pahlavuni, dated to 1031-1033:

===Church of the Holy Apostoles===
The Church of the Holy Apostles in Ani was dedicated by Abughamir Pahlavuni in 1031.

<text>A transverse arrowhead is a type of trapezoidal or triangular stone projectile point most commonly associated with the European Mesolithic and Neolithic periods although it is also found in other regions and periods.

Unlike a conventional arrowhead which tapers to a point, transverse arrowheads widen to a cutting edge and was hafted onto an arrow shaft at its narrowest point. Other types have parallel sides but in any case transverse arrowheads are always wider than they are long.

<text>The River Bourne is a river in the English county of Wiltshire, a tributary of the Salisbury Avon. It flows in a generally southerly direction for about . In its upper reaches the river is a winterbourne, often dry in summer.

The Bourne&#x27;s source is at the eastern end of the Vale of Pewsey, just south of the village of Burbage. The river cuts through the chalk escarpment at Collingbourne Kingston, to flow south across Salisbury Plain through the town of Tidworth and the village of Shipton Bellinger.

As it continues south the river passes the Bourne Valley villages: Cholderton, Newton Tony, Allington, Boscombe, Idmiston, Porton, Gomeldon, Winterbourne Gunner, Winterbourne Dauntsey, Winterbourne Earls and Hurdcott. After passing Ford and Laverstock, the Bourne joins the Avon in the eastern outskirts of Salisbury.

<doc id="1115991" wikidata="Q779025" url="?curid=1115991" title="Cecil Purdy">
<text>C.J.S. (Cecil John Seddon) Purdy (27 March 1906 – 6 November 1979) was an Australian chess player and writer. He was awarded the International Master title in 1951 and the Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess title in 1959. Purdy was the first world correspondence chess champion. He was also an influential chess magazine writer, editor, and publisher.

==Early life==
Purdy was born in Port Said, Egypt, where his father John Smith Purdy was stationed as a doctor in the Quarantine Service. When he was a child, Purdy moved with his family to New Zealand, and then to Tasmania, Australia, before they settled in Sydney when he was 12, where he was educated at Cranbrook School. While in Tasmania, one of his classmates was future film star Errol Flynn.

==Career==
Purdy began his chess career at age 16. He soon decided to become a full-time chess writer and player. Initially an over-the-board (OTB) player, he soon began to mix OTB play with correspondence play. He was a four-time winner of the Australian Chess Championship, in 1935, 1937, 1949, and 1951. He also won the New Zealand Chess Championship in 1924/25. In Auckland in 1952, Purdy drew a hard-fought match with Ortvin Sarapu, at the time by far the best player in New Zealand. They were thus declared Australasian co-champions.

Purdy won the first two Australian Correspondence Chess Championships, in 1938 and 1945; and the inaugural World Correspondence Chess Championship in 1953.

Purdy founded and edited the magazine &quot;Australasian Chess Review&quot; (1929–1944), which became &quot;Check&quot; (1944–45), and finally &quot;Chess World&quot; (1946–1967). He was described by Bobby Fischer as being a great chess instructor. Some of his writings are still in print. A famous remark of his is &quot;Pawn endings are to chess what putting is to golf.&quot;

In 1976 he was awarded the Order of Australia for services to chess.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1934 to Anne Crakanthorp (1915–2013), the daughter of two-time Australian Chess Champion Spencer Crakanthorp. The marriage produced two children, John (1935–2011) and Diana. John Purdy followed in his father&#x27;s (and grandfather&#x27;s) footsteps in winning the Australian Chess Championship in 1955 and 1963. Diana, also a chess player, married leading New Zealand player Frank Hutchings in 1960.

===Death===

On 6 November 1979, Purdy collapsed while playing chess at a tournament at the Chess Centre of New South Wales and died later that day in the Sydney Hospital. He was survived by his wife, daughter and son John, who twice won the Australian Chess Championship.

<text>The Yugoslav Partisans, officially the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (often shortened as the National Liberation Army) was the communist-led anti-fascist resistance to the Axis powers (chiefly Nazi Germany) in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. Led by Josip Broz Tito, the Partisans are considered to be Europe&#x27;s most effective anti-Axis resistance movement during World War II.

Primarily a guerrilla force at its inception, the Partisans developed into a large fighting force engaging in conventional warfare later in the war, numbering around 650,000 in late 1944 and organized in four field armies and 52 divisions. The main stated objectives of the Partisans were the liberation of Yugoslav lands from occupying forces and the creation of a federal, multi-ethnic socialist state in Yugoslavia.

The Partisans were organized on the initiative of Tito following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and began an active guerrilla campaign against occupying forces after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June. A large-scale uprising was launched in July, later joined by Draža Mihailović&#x27;s Chetniks; this led to the creation of the short-lived Republic of Užice. The Axis mounted a series of offensives in response but failed to completely destroy the highly mobile Partisans and their leadership. By late 1943, the Allies had shifted their support from Mihailović to Tito as the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident, and the Partisans received official recognition at the Tehran Conference. In Autumn 1944, the Partisans and the Soviet Red Army liberated Belgrade following the Belgrade Offensive. By the end of the war, the Partisans had gained control of the entire country as well as Trieste and Carinthia. After the war, the Partisans were reorganized into the regular armed force of the newly established Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia.

== Objectives ==

One of two objectives of the movement, which was the military arm of the Unitary National Liberation Front (UNOF) coalition, led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) and represented by the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), the Yugoslav wartime deliberative assembly, was to fight the occupying forces. Until British supplies began to arrive in appreciable quantities in 1944, the occupiers were the only source of arms. The other objective was to create a federal multi-ethnic communist state in Yugoslavia. To this end, the KPJ attempted to appeal to all the various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia, by preserving the rights of each group.

The objectives of the rival resistance movement, the Chetniks, were the retention of the Yugoslav monarchy, ensuring the safety of ethnic Serb populations, and the establishment of a Greater Serbia through the ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs from territories they considered rightfully and historically Serbian. Relations between the two movements were uneasy from the start, but from October 1941 they degenerated into full-scale conflict. To the Chetniks, Tito&#x27;s pan-ethnic policies seemed anti-Serbian, whereas the Chetniks&#x27; royalism was anathema to the communists. In the early part of the war Partisan forces were predominantly composed of Serbs. In that period names of Muslim and Croat commanders of Partisan forces had to be changed to protect them from their predominantly Serb colleagues.

After the German retreat forced by the Soviet-Bulgarian offensive in Serbia, North Macedonia, and Kosovo in the autumn of 1944, the conscription of Serbs, Macedonians, and Kosovar Albanians increased significantly. By late 1944, the total forces of the Partisans numbered 650,000 men and women organized in four field armies and 52 divisions, which engaged in conventional warfare. By April 1945, the Partisans numbered over 800,000.

==Name==

The movement was consistently referred to as the &quot;Partisans&quot; throughout the war. However, due to frequent changes in size and structural reorganizations, the Partisans throughout their history held four full official names (translated here from Serbo-Croatian to English):
*National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (June 1941 – January 1942)
*National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (January – November 1942)
*National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (November 1942 – February 1945). Increasingly from November 1942, the Partisan military as a whole was often referred to simply as the National Liberation Army (&quot;Narodnooslobodilačka vojska,&quot; NOV), whereas the term &quot;Partisans&quot; acquired a wider sense in referring to the entire resistance faction (including, for example, the AVNOJ).
*Yugoslav Army – on 1 March 1945, the National Liberation Army was transformed into the regular armed forces of Yugoslavia and renamed accordingly.
The movement was originally named National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (&quot;Narodnooslobodilački partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,&quot; NOPOJ) and held that name from June 1941 to January 1942. Because of this, their short name became simply the &quot;Partisans&quot; (capitalized), and stuck henceforward (the adjective &quot;Yugoslav&quot; is used sometimes in exclusively non-Yugoslav sources to distinguish them from other partisan movements).

Between January 1942 and November 1942, the movement&#x27;s full official name was briefly National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (&quot;Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka vojska Jugoslavije,&quot; NOP i DVJ). The changes were meant to reflect the movement&#x27;s character as a &quot;volunteer army&quot;.

In November 1942, the movement was renamed into the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (&quot;Narodnooslobodilačka vojska i partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,&quot; NOV i POJ), a name which it held until the end of the war. This last official name is the full name most associated with the Partisans, and reflects the fact that the proletarian brigades and other mobile units were organized into the National Liberation Army (&quot;Narodnooslobodilačka vojska&quot;). The name change also reflects the fact that the latter superseded in importance the partisan detachments themselves.

Shortly before the end of the war, in March 1945, all resistance forces were reorganized into the regular armed force of Yugoslavia and renamed Yugoslav Army. It would keep this name until 1951, when it was renamed the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

==Background and origins==

On 6 April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded from all sides by the Axis powers, primarily by German forces, but also including Italian, Hungarian and Bulgarian formations. During the invasion, Belgrade was bombed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The invasion lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the Wehrmacht, the Army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available.

The terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany occupied the northern part of Drava Banovina (roughly modern-day Slovenia), while maintaining direct military occupation of a rump Serbian territory with a puppet government. The Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was established under German direction, which extended over much of the territory of today&#x27;s Croatia and as well contained all the area of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Syrmia region of modern-day Serbia. Mussolini&#x27;s Italy occupied the remainder of Drava Banovina (annexed and renamed as the Province of Lubiana), much of Zeta Banovina and large chunks of the coastal Dalmatia region (along with nearly all its Adriatic islands). It also gained control over the newly created Italian governorate of Montenegro, and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it. Hungary dispatched the Hungarian Third Army and occupied and annexed the Yugoslav regions of Baranja, Bačka, Međimurje and Prekmurje. Bulgaria, meanwhile, annexed nearly all of Macedonia, and small areas of eastern Serbia and Kosovo. The dissolution of Yugoslavia, the creation of the NDH, Italian governorate of Montenegro and Nedic&#x27;s Serbia and the annexations of Yugoslav territory by the various Axis countries were incompatible with international law in force at that time.
The occupying forces instituted such severe burdens on the local populace that the Partisans came not only to enjoy widespread support but for many were the only option for survival. Early in the occupation, German forces would hang or shoot indiscriminately, including women, children and the elderly, up to 100 local inhabitants for every one German soldier killed. While these measures for suppressing communist-led resistance were issued in all German-occupied territory, they were only strictly enforced in Serbia. Two of the most significant atrocities by the German forces were the massacre of 2,000 civilians in Kraljevo and 3,000 in Kragujevac. The formula of 100 hostages shot for every German soldier killed and 50 hostages shot for every wounded German soldier was cut in one-half in February 1943 and removed altogether in the fall of that same year.

Furthermore, Yugoslavia experienced a breakdown of law and order, with collaborationist militias roaming the countryside terrorizing the population. The government of the puppet Independent State of Croatia found itself unable to control its territory in the early stages of the occupation, resulting in a severe crackdown by the Ustaše militias and the German army.

Amid the relative chaos that ensued, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia moved to organize and unite anti-fascist factions and political forces into a nationwide uprising. The party, led by Josip Broz Tito, was banned after its significant success in the post-World War I Yugoslav elections and operated underground since. Tito, however, could not act openly without the backing of the USSR, and as the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was still in force, he was compelled to wait.

==Formation and early rebellion==

During the April invasion of Yugoslavia, the leadership of the Communist Party was in Zagreb, together with Josip Broz Tito. After a month, they left for Belgrade. While the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was in effect, the communists refrained from open conflict with the new regime of the Independent State of Croatia. In these first two months of occupation, they extended their underground network and began amassing weapons. In early May 1941, a so-called May consultations of Communist Party officials from across the country, who sought to organize the resistance against the occupiers, was held in Zagreb. In June 1941, a meeting of the Central Committee of KPJ was also held, at which it was decided to start preparations for the uprising.

Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.

The extent of support for the Partisan movement varied according to region and nationality, reflecting the existential concerns of the local population and authorities. The first Partisan uprising occurred in Croatia on 22 June 1941, when forty Croatian communists staged an uprising in the Brezovica woods between Sisak and Zagreb, forming the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment.

The first uprising led by Tito occurred two weeks later, in Serbia. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July, a date which was later marked as Fighter&#x27;s Day – a public holiday in the SFR Yugoslavia. One Žikica Jovanović Španac shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July in the Bela Crkva incident.

The first Zagreb-Sesvete partisan group was formed in Dubrava in July 1941. In August 1941, 7 Partisan Detachments were formed in Dalmatia with the role of spreading the uprising. On 26 August 1941, 21 members of the 1st Split Partisan Detachment were executed by firing squad after being captured by Italian and Ustaše forces. A number of other partisan units were formed in the summer of 1941, including in Moslavina and Kalnik. An uprising occurred in Serbia during the summer, led by Tito, when the Republic of Užice was created, but it was defeated by the Axis forces by December 1941, and support for the Partisans in Serbia thereafter dropped.

It was a different story for Serbs in Axis occupied Croatia who turned to the multi-ethnic Partisans, or the Serb royalist Chetniks. The journalist Tim Judah notes that in the early stage of the war the initial preponderance of Serbs in the Partisans meant in effect a Serbian civil war had broken out. A similar civil war existed within the Croatian national corpus with the competing national narratives provided by the Ustaše and Partisans.

In the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the cause of Serb rebellion was the Ustaše policy of genocide, deportations, forced conversions and mass killings of Serbs, as was the case elsewhere in the NDH. Resistance to communist leadership of the anti-Ustasha rebellion among the Serbs from Bosnia also developed in the form of the Chetnik movement and autonomous bands which were under command of Dragoljub Mihailović. Whereas the Partisans under Serb leadership were open to members of various nationalities, those in the Chetniks were hostile to Muslims and exclusively Serbian. The uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina started by Serbs in many places were acts of retaliation against the Muslims, with thousands of them killed. A rebellion began in June 1941 in Herzegovina. On 27 July 1941, a Partisan-led uprising began in the area of Drvar and Bosansko Grahovo. It was a coordinated effort from both sides of the Una River in the territory of southeastern Lika and southwestern Bosanska, and succeeded in transferring key NDH territory under rebel control.

On 10 August in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. The area they controlled, consisting of nearby villages, was called the &quot;Miners Republic&quot; and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.

At the September 1941 Stolice conference, the unified name &quot;partisans&quot; and the red star as an identification symbol were adopted for all fighters led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

In 1941, Partisan forces in Serbia and Montenegro had around 55,000 fighters, but only 4,500 succeeded to escape to Bosnia. On 21 December 1941 they formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (&quot;1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada&quot;) – the first regular Partisan military unit, capable of operating outside its local area. In 1942 Partisan detachments officially merged into the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (NOV i POJ) with an estimated 236,000 soldiers in December 1942.

Partisan numbers from Serbia would be diminished until 1943 when the Partisan movement gained upswing by spreading the fight against the axis. Increase of number of Partisans in Serbia, similarly to other republics, came partly in response to Tito&#x27;s offer of amnesty to all collaborators on 17 August 1944. At that point tens of thousands of Chetniks switched sides to the Partisans. The amnesty would be offered again after German withdrawal from Belgrade on 21 November 1944 and on 15 January 1945.

==Operations==


===Resistance and retaliation===
The Partisans staged a guerrilla campaign which enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. These were managed via the &quot;People&#x27;s committees&quot;, organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country controlled by the communists, even limited arms industries were set up. At the very beginning, Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure. They had two major advantages over other military and paramilitary formations in former Yugoslavia:
#A small but valuable cadre of Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War who, unlike anyone else at the time, had experience with modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those of World War II Yugoslavia
#They were founded on ideology rather than ethnicity, which meant the Partisans could expect at least some levels of support in any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations whose support was limited to territories with Croat or Serb majorities. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.

Occupying and quisling forces, however, were quite aware of the Partisan threat, and attempted to destroy the resistance in what Yugoslav historiographers defined as seven major enemy offensives. These are:
*The First Enemy Offensive, the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the &quot;Republic of Užice&quot;, a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.
*The Second Enemy Offensive, the coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over Igman mountain near Sarajevo.
*The Third Enemy Offensive, an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, Montenegro, Sandžak and Herzegovina which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as &quot;Operation TRIO&quot; by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the Battle of Kozara, which took place in the summer of 1942.
*The Fourth Enemy Offensive, against &quot;Republic of Bihać&quot;, also known as the Battle of the Neretva or &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (Case White), a conflict spanning the area between western Bosnia and northern Herzegovina, and culminating in the Partisan retreat over the Neretva river. It took place from January to April 1943.
*The Fifth Enemy Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or &quot;Fall Schwarz&quot; (&quot;Case Black&quot;). The operation immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.
*The Sixth Enemy Offensive, a series of operations undertaken by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Ustaše&quot; after the capitulation of Italy in an attempt to secure the Adriatic coast. It took place in late 1943 and early 1944.
*The Seventh Enemy Offensive, the final attack in western Bosnia in the second quarter of 1944, which included &quot;Operation Rösselsprung&quot; (Knight&#x27;s Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate Tito and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.

Partisans operated as a regular army that remained highly mobile across occupied Yugoslavia. Partisan units engaged in overt acts of resistance which led to significant reprisals against civilians by Axis forces. The killing of civilians discouraged the Chetniks from carrying out overt resistance, however the Partisans were not fazed and continued overt resistance which disrupted Axis forces, but led to significant civilian casualties.

===Allied support===
Later in the conflict the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the western Allies, who until then had supported General Draža Mihailović&#x27;s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration fighting by many military missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.

To gather intelligence, agents of the western Allies were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in Yugoslavia. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the demise of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito&#x27;s Partisans. In 1942, although supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. The new year would bring a change. The Germans were executing Operation Schwarz (the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when F.W.D. Deakin was sent by the British to gather information. On April 13, 1941, Winston Churchill sent his greetings to the Yugoslav people. In his greeting he stated:

His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German 1st Mountain and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had traveled from Russia by railway through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. All in all, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy. In September 1943, at Churchill&#x27;s request, Brigadier General Fitzroy Maclean was parachuted to Tito&#x27;s headquarters near Drvar to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.

Thus, after the Tehran Conference the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the Allies, who subsequently set up the RAF Balkan Air Force (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito&#x27;s Partisan forces. During a meeting with Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Combined Chiefs of Staff of 24 November 1943, Winston Churchill pointed out that:

===Activities increase (1943–1945)===
 With Allied air support (&quot;Operation Flotsam&quot;) and assistance from the Red Army, in the second half of 1944 the Partisans turned their attention to Serbia, which had seen relatively little fighting since the fall of the Republic of Užice in 1941. On 20 October, the Red Army and the Partisans liberated Belgrade in a joint operation known as the Belgrade Offensive. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia – Serbia, Vardar Macedonia and Montenegro, as well as the Dalmatian coast.

In 1945, the Partisans, numbering over 800,000 strong defeated the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia and the Wehrmacht, achieving a hard-fought breakthrough in the Syrmian front in late winter, taking Sarajevo in early April, and the rest of the NDH and Slovenia through mid-May. After taking Rijeka and Istria, which were part of Italy before the war, they beat the Allies to Trieste by two days. The &quot;last battle of World War II in Europe&quot;, the Battle of Poljana, was fought between the Partisans and retreating Wehrmacht and quisling forces at Poljana, near Prevalje in Carinthia, on 14–15 May 1945.

==Overview by post-war republic==

===Serbia===

The Axis invasion led to the division of Yugoslavia between the Axis powers and the Independent State of Croatia. The largest part of Serbia was organized into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and as such it was the only example of military regime in occupied Europe. The Military Committee of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party for Serbia was formed in mid-May 1941. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia arrived in Belgrade in late May, and this was of great importance for the development of the resistance in Yugoslavia. After their arrival, the Central Committee held conferences with local party officials. The decision for preparing the struggle in Serbia issued on June 23, 1941 at the meeting of the Provincial Committee for Serbia. On July 5, a Communist Party proclamation appeared that called upon the Serbian people to struggle against the invaders. Western Serbia was chosen as the base of the uprising, which later spread to other parts of Serbia. A short-lived republic was created in the liberated west, the first liberated territory in Europe. The uprising was suppressed by German forces by 29 November 1941. The Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia is believed to have been founded in Užice on 17 November 1941. It was the body of the Partisan resistance in Serbian territory.

The Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Serbia was held 9–12 November 1944.

Tito&#x27;s post-war government built numerous monuments and memorials in Serbia after the war.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Serbian Partisan detachments entered Bosnian territory after the Operation Uzice which saw the Serbian uprising quelled. The Bosnian Partisans were heavily reduced during Operation Trio (1942) on the resistance in eastern Bosnia.

===Croatia===

The National Liberation Movement in Croatia was part of the anti-fascist National Liberational Movement in the Axis-occupied Yugoslavia which was the most effective anti-Nazi resistance movement led by Yugoslav revolutionary communists during the Second World War. NOP was under the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (KPJ) and supported by many others, with Croatian Peasant Party members contributing to it significantly. NOP units were able to temporarily or permanently liberate large parts of Croatia from occupying forces. Based on the NOP, the Federal Republic of Croatia was founded as a constituent of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.

==Services==

Aside from ground forces, the Yugoslav Partisans were the only resistance movement in occupied Europe to employ significant air and naval forces.

===Partisan Navy===
Naval forces of the resistance were formed as early as 19 September 1942, when Partisans in Dalmatia formed their first naval unit made of fishing boats, which gradually evolved into a force able to engage the Italian Navy and Kriegsmarine and conduct complex amphibious operations. This event is considered to be the foundation of the Yugoslav Navy. At its peak during World War II, the Yugoslav Partisans&#x27; Navy commanded 9 or 10 armed ships, 30 patrol boats, close to 200 support ships, six coastal batteries, and several Partisan detachments on the islands, around 3,000 men. Their main base was the small port of Podgora, which was bombarded several times by Italian naval forces. On 26 October 1943, it was organized first into four, and later into six, Maritime Coastal Sectors (&quot;Pomorsko Obalni Sektor&quot;, POS). The task of the naval forces was to secure supremacy at sea, organize defense of coast and islands, and attack enemy sea traffic and forces on the islands and along the coasts.

===Partisan Air Force===
The Partisans gained an effective air force in May 1942, when the pilots of two aircraft belonging to the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (French-designed and Yugoslav-built Potez 25, and Breguet 19 biplanes, themselves formerly of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force), Franjo Kluz and Rudi Čajavec, defected to the Partisans in Bosnia. Later, these pilots used their aircraft against Axis forces in limited operations. Although short-lived due to a lack of infrastructure, this was the first instance of a resistance movement having its own air force. Later, the air force would be re-established and destroyed several times until its permanent institution. The Partisans later established a permanent air force by obtaining aircraft, equipment, and training from captured Axis aircraft, the British Royal Air Force (see BAF), and later the Soviet Air Force.

==Composition==
Yugoslav Partisans were predominantly Serb in composition into 1943. Also, it should be kept in mind that until the middle of the war the Partisans were in control of relatively large liberated areas only in parts of Bosnia. Over the entirety of the war according to the records of recipients of Partisan pensions from 1977, the ethnic composition of the Partisans was 53.0% Serb, 18.6% Croat, 9.2% Slovene, 5.5% Montenegrin, 3.5% Bosnian Muslim, and 2.7% Macedonian. Much of the remainder of the NOP&#x27;s membership was made up of Albanians, Hungarians and those self-identifying as Yugoslavs. At the moment of the capitulation of Italy to the Allies, the Serbs and Croats were participating equally according to their respective population sizes in Yugoslavia as a whole. According to Tito, by May 1944, the ethnic composition of the Partisans was 44% Serb, 30% Croat, 10% Slovene, 5% Montenegrin, 2.5% Macedonian and 2.5% Bosnian Muslim. Italians were also in the army: more than 40,000 Italian fighters were in several military formations such as 9th Corps (Yugoslav Partisans), Partisan Battalion Pino Budicin, Partisan Division &quot;Garibaldi&quot; and Division Italia (Yugoslavia) later and others.
Following the Soviet-Bulgarian offensive in Serbia and North Macedonia in the autumn of 1944, mass Partisan conscription of Serbs, Macedonians and eventually Kosovo Albanians increased. The number of Serbian Partisan brigades went up from 28 in June 1944 to 60 by the end of the year. In regional terms, the Partisan movement was therefore disproportionately west Yugoslav, particularly from Croatia, while until the autumn of 1944, Serbia&#x27;s contribution was disproportionately small. During 1941 until September 1943 from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina 1,064 of Jews joined the Partisans, and largest part of Jews joined the Partisans after the capitulation of Italy in 1943. At the end of the war, 2,339 of Jewish Partisans from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina survived while 804 were killed. Most of the Jews who joined the Yugoslav Partisans were from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Romano this number is 4,572; 1,318 of them were killed.

According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,
In partitioned Yugoslavia, partisan resistance developed among the Slovenes in German-annexed Slovenia, engaging mostly in small-scale sabotage. In Serbia, a cetnik resistance organization developed under a former Yugoslav Army Colonel, Draža Mihailovic. After a disastrous defeat in an uprising in June 1941, this organization tended to withdraw from confrontation with the Axis occupying forces. The communist-dominated Partisan organization under the leadership of Josef Tito was a multi-ethnic resistance force – including Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Bosniaks, Jews, and Slovenes. Based primarily in Bosnia and northwestern Serbia, Tito&#x27;s Partisans fought the Germans and Italians most consistently and played a major role in driving the German forces out of Yugoslavia in 1945.

By April 1945, there were some 800,000 soldiers in the Partisan army. Composition by region (ethnicity is not taken into account) from late 1941 to late 1944 was as follows:
According to Fabijan Trgo in the summer of 1944 the National Liberation Army had about 350,000 soldiers in 39 divisions, which were grouped into 12 Corps. In September 1944 about 100,000 soldiers in 17 divisions were ready to enter the final phase of the battle for the liberation of Serbia, overall in all Yugoslav areas the National Liberation Army had about 400,000 armed soldiers. That is, 15 corps, ie 50 divisions, 2 operational groups, 16 independent brigades, 130 partisan detachments, the navy and the first aviation formations. At the beginning of 1945, the number of soldiers was about 600,000. On March 1, the Yugoslav Army had more than 800,000 soldiers, grouped in 63 divisions.

The Chetniks were a mainly Serb-oriented group and their Serb nationalism resulted in an inability to recruit or appeal to many non-Serbs. The Partisans played down communism in favour of a Popular Front approach which appealed to all Yugoslavs. In Bosnia, the Partisan rallying cry was for a country which was to be neither Serbian nor Croatian nor Muslim, but instead to be free and brotherly in which full equality of all groups would be ensured. Nevertheless, Serbs remained the dominant ethnic group in the Yugoslav Partisans throughout the war. Italian collaboration with Chetniks in northern Dalmatia resulted in atrocities which further galvanized support for the Partisans among Dalmatian Croats. Chetnik attacks on Gata, near Split, resulted in the slaughter of some 200 Croatian civilians.

In particular, Mussolini&#x27;s policy of forced Italianization ensured the first significant number of Croats joining the Partisans in late 1941. In other areas, recruitment of Croats was hindered by some Serbs&#x27; tendency to view the organisation as exclusively Serb, rejecting non-Serb members and raiding the villages of their Croat neighbours. A group of Jewish youths from Sarajevo attempted to join a Partisan detachment in Kalinovnik, but the Serbian Partisans turned them back to Sarajevo, where many were captured by the Axis forces and perished. Attacks from Croatian Ustaše on the Serbian population was considered to be one of the important reasons for the rise of guerrilla activities, thus aiding an ever-growing Partisan resistance. Following the capitulation of Italy and subsequent Belgrade Offensive, many members of the Ustaše joined the partisans.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
At the beginning of the war, the dominant Serb composition of the Partisan rank and file and alliance with the Chetniks, who were engaged in atrocities and killing of Croat and Muslim civilians, forced Croats and Muslims not to join the Bosnian Partisans. Until early 1942, the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were almost exclusively Serbs, cooperated closely with the Chetniks, and some Partisans in eastern Herzegovina and western Bosnia refused to accept Muslims into their ranks. For many Muslims, the behavior of these Serb Partisans towards them meant that there was little difference for them between the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Partisans were successful in attracting both Muslims and Croats from the beginning, notably in the Kozara Mountain area in north-west Bosnia and the Romanija Mountain area near Sarajevo. In the Kozara area, Muslims and Croats made up 25 percent of Partisan strength by the end of 1941.

According to Hoare, by late 1943, 70% of the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina were Serb and 30% were Croat and Muslim. At the end of 1977, Bosnian recipients of war pensions were 64.1% Serb, 23% Muslim, and 8.8% Croat.

===Croatia===
In 1941–42, the majority of Partisans in Croatia were Serbs. However, by October 1943, the majority were Croats. This change was partly due to the decision of a key Croatian Peasant Party member, Božidar Magovac, to join the Partisans in June 1943, and partly due to the surrender of Italy. At the moment of the capitulation of Italy to the Allies the Serbs and Croats were participating equally according to their respective population sizes in Yugoslavia as a whole. According to Goldstein, among Croatian partisans at the end of 1941, 77% were Serbs and 21.5% were Croats, and others as well as unknown nationalities. The percentage of Croats in the Partisans had increased to 32% by August 1942, and 34% by September 1943. After the capitulation of Italy, it increased further. At the end of 1944 there were 60.4% Croats, 28.6% Serbs and 11% of other nationalities (2.8% Muslims, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Italians, Hungarians, Czechs, Jews and Germans) in Croatian partisan units. According to Ivo Banac, the Croatian Partisan movement in the second half of 1944 had about 150,000 combatants under arms, while 100,070 were in operative units where Croats numbered 60,703 (60.7%), Serbs 24,528 (24.5%), Slovenes 5,113 (5.1%), and others. The Serb contribution to Croatian Partisans represented more than their proportion of the local population.

Croatian Partisans were integral to overall Yugoslav Partisans with ethnic Croats in prominent positions in the movement since the very beginning of the war; According to some researchers writing during 1990s, like Cohen, by the end of 1943, Croatia proper, with 24% of the Yugoslav population, provided more Partisans than Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia and Macedonia combined (though not more than Bosnia and Herzegovina). In early 1943 Partisans took steps to establish ZAVNOH (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Croatia) to act as a parliamentary body for all of Croatia – the only one of its kind in occupied Europe. ZAVNOH held three plenary sessions during the war in areas which remained surrounded by Axis troops. At its fourth and last session, held on 24–25 July 1945 in Zagreb, ZAVNOH proclaimed itself as the Croatian Parliament or Sabor.

By the end of 1941 in the territory of the NDH, Serbs comprised approximately one-third of the population but about 95% of all Partisans. This numerical dominance lessened later, but until 1943 Serbs formed a majority of Partisans in Croatia (including Dalmatia). Territories in Croatia proper with a substantial number of Serb inhabitants (Lika, Banija, Kordun) formed the most important source of manpower for the Partisans. In May 1941 the Ustasha regime ceded northern Dalmatia to Fascist Italy, which caused increasingly massive support for the Partisans among the Croats of Dalmatia. In other parts of Croatia Croat support toward the Partisans gradually increased due to Ustasha and Axis violence and misrule, but much more slowly than in Dalmatia. There were only 1,492 Partisans from Serbia out of the 22,148 Partisans of Tito&#x27;s Main Operational Group () at the Battle of the River Sutjeska in June 1943, and 8,925 were from Croatia (of which 5,195 were from Dalmatia), but in ethnic terms, 11,851 were Serbs beside 5,220 Croats. At the end of 1943 all 13 Dalmatian Partisan brigades had a Croat majority, but among the 25 Partisan brigades from Croatian proper (without Dalmatia) only 7 had a Croat majority (17 had a Serb majority and one had a Czech majority). According to historians Tvrtko Jakovina and Davor Marijan the main reason for massive participation of Croats in Battle of the Sutjeska in June 1943 was ongoing terror of Italian fascists.

According to Tito, one-quarter of Zagreb&#x27;s population (i.e. more than 50,000 citizens) participated in the Partisan struggle during which over 20,000 of them were killed (half of them as active fighters). As Partisan combatants 4,709 citizens of Zagreb were killed while 15,129 were killed in Ustasha and Nazi prisons and concentration camps, and another 6,500 were killed during anti-insurgency operations.

In the final offensive for the liberation of Yugoslavia, from Croatia was engaged 165,000 soldiers mostly for the liberation of Croatia. On Croatian territory after 30 November 1944 in combat with the enemy participated 5 corps, 15 divisions, 54 brigades and 35 Partisan detachments, a total of 121,341 soldiers (117,112 men and 4239 woman) which at the end of 1944 made up about third of the entire armed forces of the National Liberation Army. At the same time, on the territory of Croatia there was 340,000 of German soldiers, 150,000 of Ustasha and Home Guard soldiers while the Chetniks at beginning of 1945 withdrew towards Slovenia. According to the ethnic composition of Partisans, most were Croats 73,327 or 60.4%, followed by Serbs 34,753 or 28.6%, Muslims 3,316 or 2.8%, Jews 284 or 0.3% and Slovenes, Montenegrins and others with 9,671 or 8.0%, (number of Partisans and ethnic composition does not include 9 brigades which were engaged outside of Croatia).

===Serbia===
By the end of September 1941, 24 detachments have been established with approximately 14,000 soldiers. By the end of 1943, 97 Partisan brigades existed overall, while in the eastern parts of Yugoslavia (Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia) 18 Partisan brigades existed. In Serbia during the spring and summer of 1944, many Chetnik deserters and prisoners joined Partisans units.
When the Soviets liberated Serbia at the end of 1944, mass Partisan mobilization of Serbians, Macedonians and eventually Kosovo Albanians began, which led to a balanced geographical contribution between the eastern and western Yugoslav Partisan movements. Serbia’s contribution to the Partisan movement prior to the autumn of 1944 was disproportionately small. At the end of September 1944, Serbia had about 70,000 soldiers under the command of the Main Staff of Serbia of which in the 13th Corps were about 30,000 soldiers, in the 14th Corps 32,463 soldiers and in the 2nd Proletarian Division 4,600 soldiers.

===Slovenia===


During World War II, Slovenia was in a unique situation in Europe. Only Greece shared its experience of being trisected; however, Slovenia was the only country that experienced a further step – absorption and annexation into neighboring Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Hungary. As the very existence of the Slovene nation was threatened, the Slovene support for the Partisan movement was much more solid than in Croatia or Serbia. An emphasis on the defence of ethnic identity was shown by naming the troops after important Slovene poets and writers, following the example of the Ivan Cankar battalion.

At the very beginning, the Partisan forces were small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure. However, the Spanish Civil War veterans amongst them had some experience with guerrilla warfare. The Partisan movement in Slovenia functioned as the military arm of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, an Anti-Fascist resistance platform established in the Province of Ljubljana on 26 April 1941, which originally consisted of multiple groups of left wing orientation, most notable being Communist Party and Christian Socialists. During the course of the war, the influence of the Communist Party of Slovenia started to grow, until its supremacy was officially sanctioned in the Dolomiti Declaration of 1 March 1943. Some of the members of Liberation Front and partisans were ex-members of the TIGR resistance movement.

Representatives of all political groups in Liberation Front participated in Supreme Plenum of Liberation Front, which led the resistance efforts in Slovenia. Supreme Plenum was active until 3 October 1943 when, at the Assembly of the Slovenian Nation&#x27;s Delegates in Kočevje, the 120-member Liberation Front Plenum was elected as the supreme body of the Slovenian Liberation Front. The plenum also functioned as Slovenian National Liberation Committee, the supreme authority in Slovenia. Some historians consider the Kočevje Assembly to be the first Slovene elected parliament and Slovene Partisans as its representatives also participated on 2nd session of the AVNOJ and were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of a new federal Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front Plenum was renamed the Slovenian National Liberation Council at the conference in Črnomelj on 19 February 1944 and transformed into the Slovenian parliament.

The Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and Slovene language as the commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language. From 1942 till after 1944, they wore the &quot;Triglavka&quot; cap, which was then gradually replaced with the &quot;Titovka&quot; cap as part of their uniform. In March 1945, the Slovene Partisan Units were officially merged with the Yugoslav Army and thus ceased to exist as a separate formation.

The partisan activities in Slovenia started in 1941 and were independent of Tito&#x27;s partisans in the south. In autumn 1942, Tito attempted for the first time to control the Slovene resistance movement. Arso Jovanović, a leading Yugoslav communist who was sent from Tito&#x27;s Supreme Command of Yugoslav partisan resistance, ended his mission to establish central control over the Slovene partisans unsuccessfully in April 1943. The merger of the Slovene Partisans with Tito&#x27;s forces happened in 1944.

In December 1943, Franja Partisan Hospital was built in difficult and rugged terrain, only a few hours from Austria and the central parts of Germany. The partisans broadcast their own radio program called &quot;Radio Kričač&quot;, the location of which never became known to occupying forces, although the receiver antennas from the local population had been confiscated.

==Casualties==
Despite their success, the Partisans suffered heavy casualties throughout the war. The table depicts Partisan losses, 7 July 1941 – 16 May 1945:
According to Ivo Goldstein, 82,000 Serbs and 42,000 Croats were killed on NDH territory as partisan combatants.

==Rescue operations==
The Partisans were responsible for the successful and sustained evacuation of downed Allied airmen from the Balkans. For example, between 1 January and 15 October 1944, according to statistics compiled by the US Air Force Air Crew Rescue Unit, 1,152 American airmen were airlifted from Yugoslavia, 795 with Partisan assistance and 356 with the help of the Chetniks. Yugoslav Partisans in Slovene territory rescued 303 American airmen, 389 British airmen and prisoners of war, and 120 French and other prisoners of war and slave laborers.

The Partisans also assisted hundreds of Allied soldiers who succeeded in escaping from German POW camps (mostly in southern Austria) throughout the war, but especially from 1943 to 1945. These were transported across Slovenia, from where many were airlifted from Semič, while others made the longer overland trek down through Croatia for a boat passage to Bari in Italy. In the spring of 1944, the British military mission in Slovenia reported that there was a &quot;steady, slow trickle&quot; of escapes from these camps. They were being assisted by local civilians, and on contacting Partisans on the general line of the River Drava, they were able to make their way to safety with Partisan guides.

===Raid at Ožbalt===

A total of 132 Allied prisoners of war were rescued from the Germans by the Partisans in a single operation in August 1944 in what is known as the Raid at Ožbalt. In June 1944, the Allied escape organization began to take an active interest in assisting prisoners from camps in southern Austria and evacuating them through Yugoslavia. A post of the Allied mission in northern Slovenia had found that at Ožbalt, just on the Austrian side of the border, about from Maribor, there was a poorly guarded working camp from which a raid by Slovene Partisans could free all the prisoners. Over 100 POWs were transported from Stalag XVIII-D at Maribor to Ožbalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to their quarters in the evening. Contact was made between Partisans and the prisoners with the result that at the end of August a group of seven slipped away past a sleeping guard at 15:00, and at 21:00 the men were celebrating with the Partisans in a village, away on the Yugoslav side of the border.

The seven escapees arranged with the Partisans for the rest of the camp to be freed the following day. Next morning, the seven returned with about a hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work-party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans, to quote a New Zealand eye-witness, &quot;swooped down the hillside and disarmed the eighteen guards&quot;. In a short time prisoners, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted along the route used by the first seven prisoners the previous evening. At the first headquarters camp reached, details were taken of the total of 132 escaped prisoners for transmission by radio to England. Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of two prisoners and two of the escort. Eventually they reached Semič, in White Carniola, Slovenia, which was a Partisan base catering for POWs. They were flown across to Bari on 21 September 1944 from the airport of Otok near Gradac.

==Post-war==

SFR Yugoslavia was one of only two European countries that were largely liberated by its own forces during World War II. It received significant assistance from the Soviet Union during the liberation of Serbia, and substantial assistance from the Balkan Air Force from mid-1944, but only limited assistance, mainly from the British, prior to 1944. At the end of the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. Partly as a result, the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the Cold War.

In 1947–48, the Soviet Union attempted to command obedience from Yugoslavia, primarily on issues of foreign policy, which resulted in the Tito–Stalin split and almost ignited an armed conflict. A period of very cold relations with the Soviet Union followed, during which the U.S. and the UK considered courting Yugoslavia into the newly formed NATO. This however changed in 1953 with the Trieste crisis, a tense dispute between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies over the eventual Yugoslav-Italian border (see Free Territory of Trieste), and with Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation in 1956. This ambivalent position at the start of the Cold War matured into the non-aligned foreign policy which Yugoslavia actively espoused until its dissolution.

===Atrocities===
The Partisans massacred civilians during and after the war. On 27 July 1941, Partisan-led units massacred around 100 Croat civilians in Bosansko Grahovo and 300 in Trubar during the Drvar uprising against the NDH. Between 5–8 September 1941, some 1,000–3,000 Muslim civilians and soldiers, including 100 Croats were massacred by the Partisan Drvar Brigade. A number of Partisan units, and the local population in some areas, engaged in mass murder in the immediate postwar period against POWs and other perceived Axis sympathizers, collaborators, and/or fascists along with their relatives, including children. These infamous massacres include the Foibe massacres, Tezno massacre, Macelj massacre, Kočevski Rog massacre, Barbara Pit massacre and the communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45.

The Bleiburg repatriations of retreating columns of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia, Chetnik and Slovene Home Guard troops, thousands of civilians heading or retreating towards Austria to surrender to western Allied forces, resulted in mass executions with tens of thousands of victims. The &quot;foibe massacres&quot; draw their name from the &quot;foibe&quot; pits in which Croatian Partisans of the 8th Dalmatian Corps (often along with groups of angry civilian locals) shot Italian fascists, and suspected collaborationists and/or separatists. According to a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission established in 1993, which investigated only on what happened in places included in present-day Italy and Slovenia, the killings seemed to proceed from endeavors to remove persons linked with fascism (regardless of their personal responsibility), and endeavors to carry out mass executions of real, potential or only alleged opponents of the communist government. The 1944–1945 killings in Bačka were similar in nature and entailed the killing of suspected Hungarian, German and Serbian fascists, and their suspected affiliates, without regard to their personal responsibility. During this purge, a large number of civilians from the associated ethnic group were also killed.

The Partisans did not have an official agenda of liquidating their enemies and their cardinal ideal was the &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; of all Yugoslav nations (the phrase became the motto for the new Yugoslavia). The country suffered between 900,000 and 1,150,000 civilian and military dead during the Axis occupation. Between 80,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the partisan purges and at least 30,000 people were killed in the Bleiburg killings, according to Marcus Tanner in his work, &quot;Croatia: a Nation Forged in War&quot;.

This chapter of Partisan history was a taboo subject for conversation in the SFR Yugoslavia until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulation for nationalist propaganda purposes.

==Equipment==

The first small arms for the Partisans were acquired from the defeated Royal Yugoslav Army, like the M24 Mauser rifle. Throughout the war the Partisans used any weapons they could find, mostly weapons captured from the Germans, Italians, Army of the NDH, Ustaše and the Chetniks, such as the Karabiner 98k rifle, MP 40 submachine gun, MG 34 machine gun, Carcano rifle and carbine, and Beretta submachine gun. The other way that the Partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, including the PPSh-41 and the Sten MKII submachine guns respectively. Additionally, Partisan workshops created their own weapons modelled on factory-made weapons already in use, including the so-called &quot;Partisan rifle&quot; and the anti-tank &quot;Partisan mortar&quot;.

==Ranks==

===Officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Women==

The Yugoslav Partisans mobilized many women. The Yugoslav National Liberation Movement claimed 6,000,000 civilian supporters; its two million women formed the Antifascist Front of Women (AFŽ), in which the revolutionary coexisted with the traditional. The AFŽ managed schools, hospitals and even local governments. About 100,000 women served with 600,000 men in Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav National Liberation Army. It stressed its dedication to women&#x27;s rights and gender equality and used the imagery of traditional folklore heroines to attract and legitimize the (; Partisan Woman). Members included figures such as Judita Alargić.

After the war, traditional gender roles were reinstated, but Yugoslavia is unique as its historians paid extensive attention to women&#x27;s roles in the resistance, until the country broke up in the 1990s. Then the memory of the women soldiers faded away.

==Partisan legacy==

===Political===


The Partisan legacy is the subject of considerable debate and controversy due to the rise of ethnic nationalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Historical revisionism following the breakup of Yugoslavia has rendered the movement ideologically incompatible within the post-communist sociopolitical framework. This revisionist historiography has caused the Partisans&#x27; role in World War II to be generally ignored, disparaged or attacked within successor states.

Despite social changes commemorative tributes to the Partisan struggle are still observed throughout the former Yugoslavia, and are attended by veteran associations, descendants, yugo-nostalgics, Titoists, leftists and sympathisers.

The successor branches of the former Association of War Veterans of the People&#x27;s Liberation War (SUBNOR), represent Partisan veterans in each republic and lobby against political and legal rehabilitation of war collaborators, along with efforts to renamed streets and public squares. These organisation&#x27;s also maintain monuments and memorials dedicated to the People&#x27;s Liberation War and anti-fascism in each respective nation.

===Cultural===
According to Vladimir Dedijer, more than 40,000 works of folk poetry were inspired by the Partisans.

<text>Daryl Mark Stuermer (born November 27, 1952) is an American musician, songwriter, singer, and record producer best known for playing the guitar and bass for Genesis during live shows, and lead guitar for Phil Collins during most solo tours and albums. He has also released nine solo albums, and tours with his Daryl Stuermer Band.

==Early life==
Stuermer was born on November 27, 1952, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He cites Duane, his elder brother of two years, also a musician, who introduced him to music by Elvis Presley and Ray Charles. As a youngster he became a fan of the instrumental rock band The Ventures, which &quot;really got me going&quot;. He began to play the guitar at age eleven, and moved into jazz guitar four years later. In 1970, Stuermer graduated from St. Francis High School in St. Francis, Wisconsin.

==Career==
===Early bands===
In the early 1970s, Stuermer formed his Milwaukee-based jazz rock band Sweetbottom, playing local gigs five nights a week. It was during one of these gigs in 1975 that keyboardist George Duke, then of The Mothers of Invention with Frank Zappa, noticed him and suggested his name to jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, who was looking for a guitarist to join his own band. After a successful audition, Stuermer became a full time member and is featured on three of their albums released between 1975 and 1977: &quot;Aurora&quot;, &quot;Imaginary Voyage&quot;, and &quot;Enigmatic Ocean&quot;.

In addition to Ponty, he played on Duke&#x27;s solo albums &quot;I Love the Blues, She Heard My Cry&quot; and &quot;Liberated Fantasies&quot;.

===Genesis===

In late 1977, Stuermer, on insistence of friend Alphonso Johnson, was recommended as a replacement for Steve Hackett to support Genesis for live performances. Johnson&#x27;s audition was unsuccessful, and he put Stuermer&#x27;s name forward. Stuermer&#x27;s only exposure to the band was when Ponty played him &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot;, and a television clip showing Gabriel singing in costume. A chance meeting with drummer Chester Thompson, who had replaced Bill Bruford as their touring drummer in 1976, convinced Stuermer to go for the audition. His audition with Mike Rutherford took place in early 1978 in New York City, and landed the spot on the same day. He typically plays lead guitar on the Gabriel/Hackett era songs, while playing rhythm guitar/bass on the Banks/Collins/Rutherford era songs. He retained the role of lead guitarist and bass player with the band from 1978 to 1992: he also rejoined them for the 2007 Turn It On Again Tour, and returned for the 2021–22 The Last Domino? Tour.

===Solo career===
During Genesis&#x27;s break in activity for much of 1979, Stuermer secured work by touring North America with singer Gino Vannelli in support of his album &quot;Brother to Brother&quot;.

In 1981, Stuermer followed Genesis frontman Phil Collins as lead guitarist for Collins&#x27; solo career, with a speaking part in the clip for &quot;One More Night&quot; and being mentioned by name in the music video for &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot;. In doing so, he transitioned from what Collins called a &quot;permanent-temporary-part-time member&quot; of Genesis to a &quot;permanent-touring-recording member&quot; of Collins&#x27; new group. Stuermer is credited as a writer on several songs that Collins recorded, including &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; on &quot;...But Seriously&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; on &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, which evolved from one of Stuermer&#x27;s demos.

In 1988, Stuermer released his debut solo album &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;. He considered making it a more vocal-oriented album having performed with Collins throughout the decade, but he opted to produce a rock instrumental album.

Stuermer went on to record &quot;Live and Learn&quot;, &quot;Another Side of Genesis&quot;, &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;, &quot;Retrofit&quot;, &quot;The Nylon String Sampler&quot;, &quot;Rewired: the Electric Collection&quot; and &quot;Go!&quot;. Released in 2002 was a Sweetbottom live reunion album, recorded at Shank Hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 

Stuermer&#x27;s album &quot;Go!&quot; was released in early 2007. It contains many older tracks from Stuermer&#x27;s Sweetbottom days, and includes appearances from Alphonso Johnson, Kostia, John Calarco, and Eric Hervey. Stuermer released the album on Inside Out Records as they offered him greater freedom to explore a musical direction that he wished to pursue. His current project is called Daryl Stuermer − Symphony Concert, which involves band members Kostia, Alan Arber and Eric Hervey and singer Forrest &quot;Woody&quot; Mankowski, recreating classic Genesis material mixed with instrumentals from his solo career.

==Equipment==
Stuermer has been a Fender Stratocaster user for most of his career with Phil Collins. His primary guitars have been a Torino Red Eric Clapton Stratocaster and a 3-Tone Sunburst American Standard Stratocaster, though he also played banjo on the Collins song &quot;The Roof Is Leaking&quot;. In addition to the Fender Stratocaster in his tenure with Collins and Genesis, he played Gibson RD Artist bass guitars and Ibanez electric guitars in 1978. He then switched to a SUNTECH Model SA-MFSC &quot;Stratocaster Style&quot; guitar from 1978 to 1984 and used a Shergold Bass Guitar (1980), a Fender Precision Bass guitar in 1981/1982, a Strata (Status Graphite) bass guitar and a Roland guitar (1983–84), a Steinberger bass guitar and guitar (1986/1987), a Yamaha bass guitar in 1992 and a Lakland custom bass guitar in 2007. Stuermer used a Gibson ES-346 in 2004/2005, and as of 2007 he has largely been using a Godin LGXT electric guitar. He also uses a Godin Montreal Premier, a Godin DS-1 (a custom guitar that Godin built for Stuermer) and a Sadowsky nylon string electric guitar.

<doc id="1116006" wikidata="Q3493339" url="?curid=1116006" title="Histeria!">
<text>Histeria! is an American animated series created by Tom Ruegger and produced by Warner Bros. Television Animation. Unlike other animated series produced by Warner Bros. in the 1990s, &quot;Histeria!&quot; was an explicitly educational program created to meet FCC requirements for educational/informational content for children.

&quot;Histeria!&quot; aired on Kids&#x27; WB from September 14, 1998 to March 31, 2000, and continued to air reruns until August 30, 2001. The show was presented as a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;-style sketch comedy, with its cast often filling the roles of historical figures. It was to be WB&#x27;s most ambitious project since &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. Like the aforementioned series, 65 episodes were originally going to be made, but due to being $10 million over budget, only 52 episodes were completed before production of the series was canceled in March 2000. Due to the high production costs, footage from previous episodes was often re-used and re-timed to match newly recorded audio, as well as several non-educational segments being used as filler. More recently, the show was aired on In2TV, first from March to July 2006, and then it returned in October of that year. In January 2009, all of the episodes were taken off the site. MeTV Toons included the program as part of its educational/informational slate when it launched on June 25, 2024.

==Summary==
Like other animated series produced at the time by Warner Bros. Animation, &quot;Histeria!&quot; derived most of humor from its slapstick comedy and satire, with the distinction of combining historical figures and events. Episodes would commonly feature a large cast of children and typecast adults in comedic skits and song parodies, e.g. the cause of the American Civil War sung to the tune of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; theme.

==Characters==

===The hosts===
* Father Time (Frank Welker) is the main &quot;host&quot; of &quot;Histeria!&quot;, allowing the cast to &quot;travel&quot; through time. He is dark-skinned, has a long beard and is shown to get quite irritated by the Kid Chorus when they fail to get their facts right. This tends to irritate Loud Kiddington who often screams &quot;SHEESH, WHAT A GROUCH!&quot; after he is out of sight.
* Big Fat Baby (Luke Ruegger) is the egg-shaped sidekick to Father Time, frequently accompanying him as he introduces the sketches. He is known for the foul odor he carries, caused by his constant defecation in his diaper, which is constantly stated to have been unchanged since ancient times. Big Fat Baby is also accident prone, often falling down steps or off of high places. There seems to be multiple Big Fat Babies, including some female versions with a single strand of hair and bow.
* Miss Information (Laraine Newman) is an aptly named ditzy tour guide who leads a group of tourists through various moments in history, as if the world is her own personal museum. As her name suggests, she is constantly getting her facts wrong and sometimes coming up with some demented logic to justify her statement (for example, she believes the Washington Monument is not named after George Washington because it is not called the George Monument).
* The World&#x27;s Oldest Woman (Tress MacNeille) is a very old woman who claims to remember when air was invented. She also claims to have dated every historical male in history. She seems to have a particular romantic interest in Bill Straitman. She is known to romantically hound every male host of an episode as well.

===The Kid Chorus===
* Loud Kiddington is a young boy so named for the extremely loud volume in which he talks. He often performs &quot;dramatic reenactments&quot; of loud moments in history, such as the Big Bang and the creation of dynamite; with each of this, the viewer is told to turn up the TV volume &quot;for maximum effect.&quot; Sometimes, he also keeps watch of something by almost silently muttering &quot;I see it, I see it...&quot; when it is in sight and then switching to screaming &quot;DON&#x27;T SEE IT! DON&#x27;T SEE IT!&quot; when he loses sight of it. He is voiced by Tom Ruegger&#x27;s son, Cody Ruegger, and the character&#x27;s personality is based on Cody because he &quot;has the tendency to be the loudest kid on Earth&quot;.
* Charity Bazaar (Laraine Newman) is the female lead of the &quot;Histeria!&quot; Kid Chorus, and her main personality trait is that she is usually depicted as being very depressed, as shown by her catch phrase, &quot;I&#x27;m not happy.&quot; She tends to speak in a monotone unless excited or singing, something she appears to genuinely enjoy. She is willing to take a stand for animal rights, can be easily tempted with promises of being given cookies, and hates doing math homework.
* Froggo (Nathan Ruegger) is a short blonde-haired boy in the Kid Chorus with a low, frog-like voice, hence his name. He often asks historical figures for two seemingly useless items that he can actually make an invention out of, though he does not always receive the requested items. He is also shown to have a large appetite, but dislikes turnips, and in &quot;Americana&quot;, it is shown that he is a big fan of Batman.
* Aka Pella (Cree Summer) is an African American member of the Kid Chorus who uses sassy lingo, often delivering comedically timed insults to whoever she is currently hanging out with. Unlike most of the other girls in the Kid Chorus, she is a tomboy and tends to be able to be a voice of reason to the group.
* Pepper Mills (Tress MacNeille) is a hyperactive teenage fangirl driven to adoration for any and all celebrities. Virtually everything she says is followed by enthusiastic scream. She constantly gets historical figures to give her autographs, and is then shocked to learn they are not the pop cultural celebrities for whom she has mistaken them. She also occasionally hosts an interview show titled &quot;Pepper&#x27;s Pep Rally&quot;. She seems to be incredibly fast and will pop up and scream until the person she is pestering agrees to give an autograph.
* Toast (Tress MacNeille) is a clueless surfer teenager whose name comes from the idea that his brain is fried like toast. His name is also due to the fact that his skin is perpetually sunburnt. He hosts a talk show titled &quot;Ask Me If I Care&quot;, in which he invites historical celebrities to tell him what they are famous for, only for him to eventually eject them into the sky (sometimes even into space), because he never &quot;does&quot; care about what they are telling him. He also once mentions having a rock band, which he names Nasty Head Wound, and also mentions that he has an uncle named Melba.
* Cho-Cho (Tress MacNeille) is a little Chinese girl who is more devious than she looks. Always accompanied by Lucky Bob, she likes to follow people around, refusing to leave them alone until they buy what she is selling. Her dialogue is almost always accompanied by &quot;Chopsticks&quot; as the background music.
* Lucky Bob (Jeff Bennett) is a boy with a very noticeable overbite. He tends to speak with a dim-witted drawl. He usually only speaks when agreeing with something another character has said (regardless of whatever they said), using Ed McMahon catchphrases such as &quot;You are correct, sir,&quot; &quot;Yes now,&quot; and &quot;Hi-yo!&quot;
* Pule Houser (Frank Welker) is an overweight kid in the show&#x27;s cast who tends to take abuse and is prone to pitching fits.
* Susanna Susquahanna (Tress MacNeille) is a little Native American girl with beady eyes and a large gap in her front teeth that gave her a gigantic, Sylvester-like lisp. She usually affirms things by saying &quot;Thath&#x27;s Twue&quot; (That&#x27;s true).
* Kip Ling, Chipper the Crooked Mouth Boy, and the Bow-Haired Girl are three additional Kid Chorus members who usually only show up in the songs or in crowd shots. They do not seem to have any distinguishing characteristics or dialogue like the rest of the group.

===Others===
* Bill Straitman (James Wickline) is the to the rest of the characters. He typically winds up interviewing both historical figures and the World&#x27;s Oldest Woman, the latter of which he struggles to fight off her advances.
* Mr. Smartypants (Rob Paulsen) is a shy genius who wears exceedingly large pants and spouts various tidbits of knowledge. The only part of his upper body ever seen are the top of his head and his hands. In a piece of irony, he harbors romantic feelings for Miss Information. Mr. Smartypants often explains historical facts of crude nature, such as the invention of the toilet, which exasperates Lydia Karaoke as the network censor.
* Chit Chatterson (Billy West) is an eccentric commercial salesman, often attempting to swindle his customers.
* Fetch (Frank Welker) is Loud&#x27;s aptly named talking dog, who loves chasing tennis balls and frequently asks the historical figures if they want to play catch with him. He always appears with Loud whenever the latter is attempting to sell something, with Loud claiming that he will make Fetch eat something unpleasant should he fail to make a sale, for which Fetch is never prepared. He appears to be of the same breed of dog as Hunter from &quot;Road Rovers&quot;.
* Lydia Karaoke (Nora Dunn) is an employee for Kids&#x27; WB who has been assigned as the network censor for the show, and given the show&#x27;s nature, this can be quite a hassle for her. Often, she interrupts the sketches to complain that what is about to be or has just been shown is inappropriate for children&#x27;s television (usually violence, foul language, nudity, and anything considered gross or rude). Infrequently, her attempts to moderate the show results in physical harm for her, resulting in her conceding to the original point. Lydia is also the host of &quot;What&#x27;s My Job?&quot;, a game show in which the contestants must guess the job of the historical figure featured, which, to her frustration, they can never come close to doing. According to the episode &quot;Histeria Goes to the Moon&quot;, Karaoke used to work for the Weather Channel.
* Sammy Melman (Rob Paulsen) is a spoof of the smarmy and desperate television executives, constantly belittling and demeaning the &quot;Histeria!&quot; cast for the sake of ratings.
* Molly Pitcher (Tress MacNeille) constantly offers refreshments in the form of water with a wide grin, saucer-sized eyes and overly cheery disposition, modelled after Martha Stewart.
* Nostradamus (Paul Rugg) claims to be able to &quot;predictiate&quot; the future, though he is proven wrong on occasion. He often acts erratically and impatiently, and will constantly yell &quot;Shutup&quot; in the middle of a sentence, usually to quiet any sort of audience.

==Parody of historical figures==
Most of the recurring real-life historical figures in &quot;Histeria!&quot; were portrayed as caricatures of real-life celebrities from the modern era. The intent was to make analogies to contemporary individuals in terms of personalities and attitudes. Some of these include:

<text>Ratos de Porão (Portuguese for &quot;Basement Rats&quot;) is a Brazilian crossover thrash band from São Paulo. They were formed in 1981, toured South America, North America, Asia and Europe, and still continue to play today. Their core lineup of João Gordo on vocals and Jão on drums and later guitars has remained since virtually the band&#x27;s beginning.

== History ==

=== Early days ===
Ratos de Porão, or simply &quot;RxDxPx&quot;, was formed in November 1981, existing in the Brazilian (São Paulo city) punk rock scene (alongside bands such as Olho Seco, Cólera, Inocentes, Garotos Podres, and Lobotomia). Directly influenced by the UK 82 hardcore bands such as Discharge, Charged G.B.H., Chaos U.K. The Varukers and Swedish and Finnish bands such as Anti-Cimex and Kaaos, they started to write songs that criticized Brazilian society, a revolutionary concept at the time. Their sound is regarded as one of the rawest of their scene (because other bands such as Cólera and Garotos Podres were more &#x27;punk rock&#x27; sounding than &#x27;hardcore punk&#x27;).

Their first album was released in 1983 and was titled &quot;Crucificados pelo sistema&quot;. Released on the Ataque Frontal label, it was one of the best-selling hardcore albums to come out of the country and was soon considered a punk classic worldwide. The line up was João Gordo (vocals), Mingau (guitar – later in many punk and pop bands in Brazil, currently playing in Ultraje a Rigor), Jabá (bass) and Jão (drums). Soon after, with the fall of the São Paulo punk scene (because of associated gang violence), the band split up and since then João Gordo has been accused of selling out and betraying the DIY ethics of the hardcore punk movement for several alleged reasons; he has said, &quot;I&#x27;m a traitor since 1983, because I told the guys I played hardcore, not punk. Then, I got labelled.(...)That&#x27;s a stigma&quot;.

=== Initial crossover thrash era ===
In 1985, RxDxPx came back, but with a different line up and sound. They brought thrash metal to their music, influenced by bands such as Slayer, Exodus, Kreator and hardcore bands around the world that were also transitioning to a more thrash metal sound, like Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., English Dogs, Cro-Mags, Agnostic Front and others (including Brazilian bands such as Lobotomia and Armagedom). Jão switched over to playing guitar, and an old punk named Spaghetti (who later adopted a thrash metal sound) replaced him on drums. Subsequently, they released the &quot;Descanse Em Paz&quot; album on Baratos Afins in 1986.

With their new sound, they began to associate more with heavy metal bands, becoming friends with longtime RxDxPx fans Sepultura and other bands of the Brazilian 1980s metal scene, including Korzus and Anthares. Their next studio release with Baratos Afins Records, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Cada Dia Mais Sujo e Agressivo&quot;, was also released in an English-language version (&quot;Dirty and Aggressive&quot;) (the band feared that their English was so grammatically inaccurate that many of their native English speaking fans might ridicule their translated lyrics). This release continued the band&#x27;s D-beat drum tempos.

In 1989, they signed to Roadrunner Records at the urging of Igor Cavalera of Sepultura, who played one of the band&#x27;s tapes for the label&#x27;s executives. RxDxPx then went to Germany to record their next studio LP, &quot;Brasil&quot;. With Harris Johns of Voivod and Tankard producing, the band&#x27;s production quality improved substantially in contrast to their previous releases; the instrumentation was noticeably more technical.

In 1990, they returned to Germany to record their last album with the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of João Gordo, Jão, Jabá and Spaghetti. With Harris Johns acting again as producer, their next album titled &quot;Anarkophobia&quot; was met with criticism by some fans for being the band&#x27;s most metallic release to date, having considerably more complex and lengthy song compositions and more technical musicianship. Nevertheless, &quot;Anarkophobia&quot; increased their profile within the worldwide metal scene of the early 1990s.

But in mid-1991, they had their first line-up change in years, with Spaghetti leaving the band, citing that he had &quot;been tired of the musical life&quot;. They auditioned several drummers to replace him, including Beto Silesci from Korzus, but the band decided that Silesci&#x27;s style was too metal for the new direction they were planning to pursue. Silesci was in turn replaced with Boka of the Santos Beach thrash/death metal band &quot;Psychic Possessor&quot;. In 1992, RxDxPx released its first official live album, called &quot;Ao Vivo&quot;, with a corresponding music video for the song &quot;Aids, Pop, Repressão&quot; receiving heavy air play on &quot;Furia Metal&quot; of MTV (the Brazilian equivalent of &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;).

At the decline of the thrash scene, under tension and personal problems (Jabá left the band and they had a heavy drug problem), they entered into the studio in 1994 to record their only &#x27;all lyrics in English&#x27; album, called &quot;Just Another Crime in Massacreland&quot;. The album suffered a thin production and a low promotion by the label, and it was a hard time in the life of RxDxPx.

=== Return to hardcore punk ===
After the departure of Jabá, the band had several different bass players and recorded a studio album with only punk and hardcore covers called &quot;Feijoada Acidente?&quot;, a play on the Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;. (Feijoada is a traditional food from Brazil, a stew based on beans and pork.) There were two versions of this album: one covering only Brazilian bands such as Olho Seco, Lobotomia, Garotos Podres, among others; and one covering only non-Brazilian bands such as G.B.H., Black Flag, Anti-Cimex, Minor Threat, among others.
At this time, Walter Bart (who used to play in a punk band called &quot;Não Religião&quot;) and &quot;Pica Pau&quot; (Portuguese for woodpecker), who stayed in the band until 1999, played bass.

Released in 1997, &quot;Carniceria Tropical&quot; marked a return to hardcore and Portuguese lyrics, and the band regained their former success. The same year, João Gordo started to work as a VJ for MTV Brasil.

In 1999, the bassist Cristian &quot;Fralda&quot;, who used to play in the punk rock band Blind Pigs joined the band, and they entered into the studio to re-record their first album, and called this album &quot;Sistemados Pelo Crucifa&quot; (a play on the original album title, &quot;Crucificados Pelo Sistema&quot;). The front cover was designed by the Korzus bassist, Dick Siebert.

=== Return to crossover ===
In 2002, they released the &quot;Onisciente Coletivo&quot; album, which was more thrash metal influenced once again, mixing their 1980s and 1990s styles. Bassist Cristian &quot;Fralda&quot; left to join the old hardcore/crossover/thrash band Lobotomia. In his place, bass player Paulo Júnior joined the band, an underground musician who still plays with his hardcore band &quot;Discarga&quot; and is guitarist of &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.

In 2006, they released &quot;Homem Inimigo Do Homem&quot;.

On 13 August 2013, Ratos de Porão announced on their Facebook page that they were working on a new album. Entitled &quot;Século Sinistro&quot;, the album was released on 27 May 2014.

Another eight years passed until the release of their eleven studio album, &quot;Necropolítica&quot;, released on 20 May 2022.

<text>Manizales () is a city in central Colombia. It is the capital of the Department of Caldas, and lies near the Nevado del Ruiz volcano.

Currently, the city is the main center for the production of Colombian coffee and an important hub for higher educational institutions.

==History==
Manizales was founded on October 12, 1849. The city was founded by a group of twenty Antioquians (&quot;The Expedition of the 20&quot;), who came from Neira and Salamina.

==Geography==
Manizales is the capital city of one of the smallest Colombian departments. The city is described as having an &quot;abrupt topography&quot;, and lies on the Colombian Central Mountain Range (part of the longest continental mountain range, the Andes), with a great deal of ridgelines and steep slopes, which, combined with the seismic instability of the area, has required architectural adaptations and public works to make the city safer. Even though Manizales has this very difficult topography, there are many coffee plantations in its fertile lands. The city is located in the northern part of the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis (&quot;Eje Cafetero&quot;), near the volcano Nevado del Ruiz, which has an altitude of 5,321 meters (17,457.3 ft).

It is in the basin of the Chinchiná River and sub-basin of the Guacaica River. Its natural threats are earthquakes, mudslides, and volcanic eruptions.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Manizales is &quot;Cfb&quot;, a subtropical highland climate but ever moist. Lower elevations approach an equatorial climate (&quot;Af&quot;) as found in the plains. Despite being located in the tropics, the city seldom gets very hot, featuring spring-like temperatures throughout the year owing to its high altitude. There are only two seasons in the city: the wet and dry seasons that alternate throughout the year, with each lasting about three months. Monthly averages are quite uniform. Manizales receives about of precipitation a year, with October being wettest.

==Economy==

Its core economy has traditionally been the cultivation and production of coffee. This fomented the creation of new types of employment and several factories, some of which remain in the metropolitan area while others have reduced their operations or moved to other cities aggravating the unemployment problem. These companies manufacture products such as liquor, shoes, rubber, chocolate, banks, detergents and soaps, threshing and packaged coffee, software, and metallurgy, among others. In addition, there are institutions and companies involved in the coffee sector as the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Caldas, Almacafé, Cenicafé, and a number of other industries involved in the process of coffee (threshers, cooperatives, exporters).

During the latter half of the twentieth century, many universities were founded in the city to the point that some studies regard Manizales as the second largest University city in the country. The universities are attended by students from various regions of the country such as Tolima, Risaralda, Valle, Quindio, Antioquia, Nariño and Huila, among others.

The service sector has thrived, mostly in the form of call centers, and this has become one of the city&#x27;s primary economic activities.

Manizales won first place in the special category of business promotion in the V Iberoamerican Digital Cities Award, organized by the Latin American Association of Research Centers and Telecommunication Enterprises (AHCIET). In a 2010 study conducted by the World Bank, Manizales was ranked as the best and easiest Colombian city to do business.
== Infrastructure ==

=== Main roads ===
The city&#x27;s mountainous topography causes journeying in an east–west direction and vice versa to be flatter and faster than going north–south or south–north; therefore the main parallel thoroughfares are the Santander, Paralela, and Kevin Ángel, and are arranged longitudinally most of the city&#x27;s length. The few avenues with a north–south or south–north are the Avenida Centenario and Avenida 12 de Octubre; the former is more important, for it connects downtown with the main transport hub where major access routes merge towards the city.

* Avenida Santander was the first main road of the city, formerly called Cervantes, and remains the most important motorway of the city. Its four lanes travel in the east–west–east direction. This roadway spans the entire Carrera-23 in the downtown area all the way to Calle 71 in the Battalion sector. Surrounding it are some of the most important landmarks of the city such as: Founders Theatre, Plaza 51, The Triangle, Panorama Towers, University of Caldas, Catholic University, Cervantes Building, Park Antonio Nariño, Instituto Universitario de Caldas, Herbeo Tower, General Cable Plaza and the Zona Rosa.
* Avenida Paralela was the city&#x27;s second main road. It also has four lanes moving between west and east, and as its name attests, it runs parallel to Avenida Santander. This road spans from downtown to Calle 71 in the Palermo neighborhood. It passes by some iconic places such as San Estéban Cemetery, University of Caldas, Palogrande Stadium.
* Avenida Alberto Mendoza Hoyos
* Avenida Kevin Ángel
* Avenida Panamericana

=== Manizales Aerial Tramway ===
Manizales Aerial Tramway was inaugurated on October 30, 2009. It connects downtown Manizales with the regional bus station, with a length of . Each gondola has a seating capacity of ten passengers, the whole system can carry 2,100 persons per hour. Owing to its success, the gondola lift was extended in 2013, and now connects also the suburb of Villamaria.

The entire Aerial Tramway was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner ropeways. Currently it has four stations on its route: Downtown Manizales, La Fuente, Manizales Los Cambulos Bus Terminal, and Villamaria.

=== Air transportation ===
Manizales has a domestic airport called La Nubia Airport which has a runway of about 1,400 meters and provides services from 6 am to 6 pm. Due to foggy weather conditions, it is often closed due to low visibility. Meanwhile, the existence of buildings over two stories close to the landing head make it topographically unfeasible to expand the airport, which in turn has become an obstacle to regional development; For these reasons, the International Coffee Airport is being built within the metropolitan area, in the town of Palestina, 25 minutes from Manizales. At an altitude of 1,525 m, the airport will have a runway of 2,800 meters which could be extended to 3,500 meters in order to receive long-range aircraft. It is expected that the new airport will function 24/7. It is currently being studied for its adequacy in terms of ground motion.

==Arts and culture==
The most important cultural events held in the city are the Manizales International Theater Festival, which is one of the major theater events in Latin America created in 1968 by initiative of Carlos Ariel Betancur, and the Manizales Jazz Festival, which gathers jazz musicians from all over the world; both are held annually.

The Manizales Fair was created in 1951 on the first centenary of the city. It began with bullfights and the typical &quot;Manolas&quot; parade (Spanish procession). Due to its hospitality, more shows and presentations have been brought into the fair, such as the International Coffee Beauty Pageant which together with the bullfighting season are the main events of the fair. Currently the fair includes activities such as horseback riding parades, artisanal fairs, &quot;trova&quot; concerts, other parades, sports, national and international musicians and bands, horse and livestock contests, and cultural shows. It is an important celebration in Colombia, as is the Barranquilla Carnival.

===Coffee International Beauty Pageant===

Coffee International Beauty Pageant (from ) is an international beauty pageant held annually in Manizales as part of the &quot;Feria de Manizales&quot;, a feast promoting the region known for its flagship product, coffee.

The current winner is Aleksandra Klepaczka, from Poland.

The international beauty contest originally began in 1957 and was held every two years (1957, 1959, 1961, 1963) under the name of Continental Queen of Coffee. However, to give a wider scope, in 1972 its name was changed to Miss International Queen of Coffee Pageant, thereby increasing the participation of coffee-producing countries from other continents. Manizales is the permanent home since its inception.

<doc id="1116016" wikidata="Q7961579" url="?curid=1116016" title="Waldo R. Tobler">
<text>Waldo Rudolph Tobler (November 16, 1930 – February 20, 2018) was an American-Swiss geographer and cartographer. Tobler is regarded as one of the most influential geographers and cartographers of the late 20th century and early 21st century. He is most well known for coining what has come to be referred to as Tobler&#x27;s first law of geography. He also coined what has come to be referred to as Tobler&#x27;s second law of geography.

Tobler&#x27;s career had a major impact on the development of quantitative geography, and his research spanned and influenced the study of any discipline investigating geographic phenomena. He established the discipline of analytical cartography, contributed early to Geographic information systems (GIS), and helped lay the groundwork for geographic information science (GIScience) as a discipline. He had significant contributions to computer cartography and was one of the first geographers to explore using computers in geography. In cartography, he contributed to the literature on map projections, choropleth maps, flow maps, cartograms, animated mapping. His work with analytical cartography included contributions to the mathematical modeling of geographic phenomena, such as human movement in the creation of Tobler&#x27;s hiking function. Tobler&#x27;s work has been described as ahead of its time, and many of his ideas are still unable to be fully implemented due to limitations of technology.

Tobler held the positions of professor of geography and professor of statistics at University of California, Santa Barbara and was an active Professor Emeritus at the Department of Geography until his death.

==Early life==

Tobler was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1930 to parents Verner Tobler and Hanny Urech Tobler. His father was a Swiss consular employee, and this granted Waldo Tobler both Swiss and United States citizenship. His father&#x27;s career resulted in moves to Seattle when Waldo Tobler was young, and later to Washington, D.C., when World War II started. During World War II, his father&#x27;s duties included reporting on the treatment of German Prisoners of War held in the United States. Tobler attended junior high school in Chevy Chase, Maryland, while his father was stationed in Washington, D.C.

In May 1945, after the Allied victory in Europe, the family returned to Europe by boat from Boston, Massachusetts to Le Havre France, then by train to Paris, and finally to his parents&#x27; native Switzerland. His father was then stationed in Budapest, and Tobler attended boarding school for a year in Zurich, where he learned German, then public high school in St. Gall, and Bern. Geographers Pradyumna Prasad Karan and Cotton Mather speculated that this frequent moving in early life may have influenced Tobler&#x27;s later career choices and passion for geography. Tobler later stated that these early travels may have contributed to a career in geography.

==Military service==

When Tobler turned 18 in 1948, Switzerland wanted to draft him into the Swiss Army. To avoid the Swiss draft, Tobler traveled to France and joined the United States Army in 1948. A native speaker of English, Swiss German, and French, the military trained him to speak Russian to serve as an interpreter for the Counterintelligence Corps. During his time in the military, he served as both an intelligence analyst and an interpreter in Europe (mostly in Austria) during the Korean War, and participated in interviewing Austrian Prisoners of War who had been released from the Soviet Union. Tobler described this activity as &quot;little more than industrial espionage.&quot; He left the military in 1952 and used his G.I. Bill to attend university.

==Education and field==

After leaving the military, Tobler attended classes at University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Here, Tobler was introduced to Canadian Geographer John Ross Mackay, who Tobler convinced to allow him to take advanced cartography classes as a freshman. After two years at the University of British Columbia, Tobler transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle, from which he received his B.A. (1955), M.A. (1957), and PhD (1961), all in geography. Tobler returned for his PhD only after receiving a National Science Foundation fellowship to fund his studies.

At the Department of Geography, University of Washington, Tobler participated in the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s, working with geography professors Edward Ullman and William Garrison. Here, he became one of many of Garrison&#x27;s grad students (dubbed the &quot;space cadets&quot;) who would go on to be highly influential geographers. His master&#x27;s thesis is titled &quot;An Empirical Evaluation of Some Aspects of Hypsometric Colors&quot;, and his dissertation &quot;Map Transformations of Geographic Space&quot;.

==Career and academic organizations==

===Student jobs===

While the GI Bill funded much of Tobler&#x27;s undergraduate courses, he took on several jobs during this time. As an undergraduate student, Tobler was offered positions on research expeditions to the Arctic. However, he turned down this position for a higher-paying job as a mucker in an underground gold mine in British Columbia. Tobler also worked parking cars part-time in Seattle and as a fire lookout in Seattle&#x27;s Cedar River watershed. Tobler indicated that his choice to work in these positions rather than participate in research expeditions influenced his later specialization in geography. If he had taken the research position, he likely would have been a physical geographer.

After graduating with his B.S. in geography, Tobler was offered a position as a cartographic assistant at the University of Washington, which enabled him to pursue his master&#x27;s degree.

===System Development Corporation===

In 1957, after obtaining his master&#x27;s degree, Tobler began work for the System Development Corporation (SDC), a spinoff of the RAND Corporation, in Santa Monica, California. Here, Tobler worked on developing the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, a system that combined both RADAR and computers to detect Soviet bomber aircraft, coordinate interceptor aircraft, and ultimately prevent a Soviet nuclear first strike. Tobler&#x27;s job entailed creating plastic overlay maps for Radar screens to train RADAR operators during exercises. These maps were created manually but printed using computers such as the IBM 704. With these, SDC experimented with duplication and generating maps using computers directly. Tobler&#x27;s experience here influenced his later academic publications and research on computer and analytical cartography.

In 1958, the American Association of Geographer&#x27;s annual meeting was held in Los Angeles, California. At this meeting, Tobler arranged a tour of the computer facilities that SDC operated. Tobler stated this was his first experience with the AAG.

===Pierce County planning commission===

After the SDC, Tobler worked for two years for the Pierce County planning commission. During this time, he worked to create land-use maps by manually shading with colored pencils. He left this position when after getting an NSF fellowship and returned to school to get his PhD.

===University of Michigan===

After earning his PhD in 1961, Tobler became an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan. While at the University of Michigan, Tobler was a member of the Michigan Inter-University Community of Mathematical Geographers (MICMOG), organized by fellow University of Washington geography PhD graduate William Bunge, which brought together faculty from both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University. These meetings sought to discuss topics related to quantitative geography, and organized joint seminars, which resulted in several discussion papers. At the MICMOG meetings, Tobler was given the nickname &quot;Ptobler&quot;, as he was &quot;the greatest cartographer since Ptolemy.&quot; The MICMOG seminars and publications eventually led to the creation of the journal Geographcial Analysis. Tobler remained at the University of Michigan until 1977.

===University of California, Santa Barbara===
In 1977, Tobler then moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara 1977, to be closer to the West Coast, where he grew up. Here, he continued his research in employing computers to cartography, flow, and other applications. At UC Santa Barbara, he worked with geographers Reginald Golledge and Michael Frank Goodchild. Until his retirement, he held the positions of Professor of Geography and Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He was an active Professor Emeritus here until his death.

===Other organizations===
Tobler was one of the principal investigators and a senior scientist in the National Science Foundation-sponsored National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis. Tobler served on the National Research Council the Board on Earth Sciences. He has been on the editorial board of several journals, including &quot;The American Cartographer&quot;, &quot;Journal of Regional Science&quot;, &quot;Geographical Analysis&quot;, and the &quot;International Journal of Geographical Information Systems&quot;. He was a charter member of the Urban and Regional Information Systems Association, a council member of the Regional Science Association, member and chairman of the Mathematical Social Science Board, and served as the United States delegate to the International Geographical Union Commission on Geographical Data Processing and Sensing. Until his retirement, he was a member of the Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain.

==Research and publications==
While Tobler may have fewer publications than some contemporary geographers, his publications covered a broad range of topics and are considered of exceptional quality. His career in geography profoundly impacted the discipline, and he is perhaps the most influential geographer of the past century. The Library of Congress maintains some of Tobler&#x27;s early work in &quot;The Waldo Tobler Collection&quot; within the broader &quot;Geographic Information Systems (GIS) &amp; Geospatial Resources,&quot; and the UC Santa Barbra Library maintains a collection of his work in &quot;The Waldo Tobler Academic Archives&quot;.

===Cartography===

Waldo Tobler described himself as a &quot;geographical cartographer&quot;, and his research interests reflect this. He published the first paper on using computers for making maps, established the discipline of analytical cartography, and contributed to the literature around thematic maps. His early work, including his dissertation, involved map projections, which he continued to work on throughout his life. Tobler&#x27;s time working at SDC on the SAGE system influenced his development of both computer and analytical cartography, and it is possible much of his work was kept confidential for some time due to military applications. Geographer Mark Monmonier described Tobler as &quot;arguably the twentieth century&#x27;s most innovative cartographer.&quot;

====Map projections====


One of Tobler&#x27;s largest interests, especially early in his career, was map projections, with much of his dissertation focusing on them. He is the inventor of novel and unusual map projections, including the family of Tobler hyperelliptical projections and the first derivation of the partial differential equations for area cartograms. He also invented a method for smooth two-dimensional mass-preserving areal data redistribution.

In 1972, Tobler translated and published Johann Heinrich Lambert&#x27;s 1772 &quot;Notes and comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps.&quot; Tobler served as the third author of a book by Qihe Yang and John P. Snyder titled &quot;Map Projection Transformation: Principles and Applications.&quot; This book was based on substantial translations by first author Qihe Yang from his work originally published in Chinese, and Tobler stepped in to help revise and assemble the book after Snyder died.

====Computer cartography====
Using his time and experience on the SAGE system, Tobler built upon the concepts and published his work in academic journals. Computer cartography originates as a concept from a paper written by Waldo Tobler as a graduate student in 1959, titled &quot;Automation and Cartography&quot;. This paper&#x27;s concepts, such as the &quot;Map in-Map out&quot; system (MIMO), was extremely influential in early Geographic Information Systems. Tobler&#x27;s research in developing applications for computer cartography is described by Mark Monmonier as &quot;a pivotal place in map history&quot;.

====Analytical cartography====

Tobler&#x27;s research emphasized mathematical modeling and graphic interpretations in geography through cartography. In 1976, he published a paper titled &quot;Analytical Cartography&quot;, which pioneered the discipline of analytical cartography. Analytical cartography is the foundation for many of the developments in Geographic information systems, and shapes how spatial analysis and cartography are taught today. Keith C. Clarke defined Analytical cartography as &quot;the theoretical and mathematical background behind cartography and the rules cartographers employed in the mapping process.&quot; Analytical cartography is described as the leading paradigm in cartography and is likely Tobler&#x27;s most enduring contribution to the discipline.

====Animated mapping====

Tobler was among the first to create a true animated map, using animation to show change over time, in his famous 1970 paper, 
&quot;A Computer Movie Simulating Urban Growth in the Detroit Region.&quot; While this paper is most often cited as the first time the first law of geography was invoked, the focus of the paper was on animation to show change over time, with the first law an &quot;aside&quot; to this.

====Choropleth====

Tobler formally introduced the unclassified color scheme for choropleth maps in 1973. Tobler argued that these maps would increase data density, and avoided many of the issues with Data binning and Statistical classification. There has been significant debate around the best approach to solve this issue with choropleth maps, and most choropleth maps today continue to make use of class breaks. Other approaches to creating classes in choropleth maps include using the Jenks natural breaks optimization, quantile, or equal class intervals.

====Cartograms====
Tobler&#x27;s interest in cartograms stemmed from his interest in map projections. A chapter of his dissertation was developed for their creation, later adapted and published in the Geographical Review. 
Tobler was among the first to use computers to create cartogram maps, with the rubber sheet method being the first method he proposed for their creation. This method uses rubbersheeting to transform the map coordinates based on the values of interest. He later proposed the &quot;Pseudo-Cartogram&quot; method, which approximates the pycnomirastic solution. Tobler&#x27;s methods for creating cartograms are still employed, however they have some practical problems in implementation that can sometimes ruin topology. Tobler&#x27;s methods serve as the basis for many other methods to create them.

====Flow maps====

Tobler was also concerned with representing flow (due to its involvement with movement as a mechanism of geographic change), and considered them critical to understanding geography. Combining this interest in movement with his knowledge of cartography, Tobler worked on incorporating flow maps to the problem. While crude, the result of this research was that Tobler was the first to develop a software approach to creating flow maps in 1987. The first demonstration of this technology by Tobler involved mapping the flow of money through the US Federal Reserve to the various US states. In 2003, Tobler released a freeware, Microsoft Windows-based version of his flow representation software Flow Mapper. Tobler&#x27;s flow mapper software, and similar programs, continue to be built upon and applied to new topics.

====Spatial interpolation and isorhythmic mapping====

Spatial interpolation, which involves estimating values for a spatial surface from sample locations, is a major research focus and application in spatial analysis. Tobler published several studies on different approaches to spatial interpolation, including an extension of bilinear weighted interpolation and other models.

Tobler&#x27;s pycnophylactic approach to interpolation had early applications to interpolation of surfaces used in isarithmic mapping on computers. Tobler&#x27;s approach was more straightforward then other methods of the time, and is more appropriate for samples collected at enumeration units like census tracts.

====Spatial Resolution====

According to Tobler, a dictionary definition of resolution is &quot;the capability of making distinguishable the individual parts of an object&quot;. In terms of digital raster data, which consists of pixels, spatial resolution (also referred to as ground sample distance GSD) refers to the size of one pixel on the ground.

With regard to spatial resolution Tobler has formulated the following rule of thumb: &quot;The usefulness of a GIS is constrained by its spatial resolution. The size of the smallest detectable feature is twice that of the resolution. The rule is: divide the denominator of the map scale by 1,000 to get the detectable size in meters. The resolution is one half of this amount.&quot;

The spatial precision of a database is expressed by a distance and a scale, which are mathematically related by this rule of thumb about the relation between map scale and image resolution. This rule is derived from the equivalent of 0.5 mm on a map, the smallest physical mark that a cartographer can make:

- Map Scale = Raster resolution (in meters) * 2 * 1,000

or

- Raster resolution (in meters) = Map Scale /(2 * 1,000)

By example, if the image resolution is 5m only the map scale should not be larger than 1:10,000. If you want to work at a scale of 1:2,000 the image resolution should be at least 1m.

===Laws of Geography===

In a 1970 paper in the journal Economic Geography where he discussed creating a computer movie of Detroit, Tobler stated, &quot;I invoke the first law of geography: everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things&quot;. This text following the colon in his statement, which was not the main focus of the paper, is now known as &quot;Tobler&#x27;s First Law of Geography&quot;, and is probably what Tobler is most famous for. The first law of geography is widely cited and is relevant today, particularly within the sub-discipline of geographic information science. The Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge &quot;Model Curricula&quot; in particular emphasizes the importance of the first law in the section on &quot;Metrical relationships: distance and direction.&quot; It is considered the theoretical basis of many statistics in spatial analysis, including those involved in cluster analysis and spatial autocorrelation (such as Moran&#x27;s I). Spatial autocorrelation, and Tobler&#x27;s 1970 paper, are considered central to modern approaches in technical geography. Tobler&#x27;s first law is included in the children&#x27;s book &quot;ABCs of Geography&quot; under the letter &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Tobler&quot;.

In a 1999 paper titled &quot;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation comment on a paper by D. Martin,&quot; Tobler stated &quot;Philosophically, the phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on in the inside; a sufficiently common occurrence as to warrant being called the second law of geography.&quot; In his 2004 paper &quot;On the First law of Geography: A reply&quot;, he discussed this concept again. This has come to be known as Tobler&#x27;s second law of geography. In Tobler&#x27;s 2004 paper, he discussed other potential candidates for laws of geography, including one proposed by Giuseppe Arbia, R. Benedetti, and G. Espa in a 1996 paper that stated &quot;Everything is related to everything else, but things observed at a coarse spatial resolution are more related than things observed at a finer resolution.&quot; This has come to be known as Arbia&#x27;s law of geography.

The laws of geography, particularly Tobler&#x27;s first law of geography, have been debated heavily in literature, with their status as scientific laws questioned, changes and amendments proposed, exceptions noted, and corresponding defenses by proponents of the laws. Tobler weighed in on this debate surrounding his law, and others, in a 2004 article titled &quot;On the First law of Geography: A reply&quot;.

===The Global Demography Project===

The Global Demography Project was conducted by the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis to map the human population in a series of 5 by 5 minute, or roughly one-kilometer, grids for most of the Earth. While this project had serious limitations, largely due to data limitations, it was the finest scale population set produced to that point. The project was later supported by the Columbia University&#x27;s Center for International Earth Science Information Network.

===Tobler&#x27;s hiking function===
Tobler was an avid hiker, and combined this with his interest flow and movement to generate &quot;Tobler&#x27;s hiking function&quot;, also known as &quot;Tobler&#x27;s walking rule&quot;. In this research, Tobler used himself as a subject, and was published the results in a 1993 paper. With this function, he sought to model and predict an average hiker walking speed on various slopes. Researchers have suggested this function has applications in various fields, including self-driving cars, route decisions, and wayfinding apps.

===Archeological modeling===

While at UC Santa Barbra in 1971, Tobler published models to predict the location of archaeological sites. Using the frequency of locations being noted in Cuneiform tablets discussing commercial transactions, he estimated the distance between the towns in Babylonia using a reverse gravity model.
Many of these predictions were for unknown locations and were proven accurate for at least three known towns; however, more excavation is needed to confirm the remainder of his predictions.
These ideas serve as the basis for numerous similar computer simulations to model ancient human migration, such as the settlement of Polynesia.

==Awards and honors==

===Memorials===
Rachel Tobler (Waldo Tobler&#x27;s widow) and the Geography department at UC Santa Barbra established the &quot;Waldo Tobler Memorial Lecture Fund&quot; in honor of Waldo Tobler. The fund helps &quot;to support open lectures in the fields of demography, mapping and cartography, and geographic information science.&quot; Rachel Tobler donated Waldo Tobler&#x27;s collection of papers and research materials to the UCSB Library, which now hosts them as &quot;The Waldo Tobler Academic Archives&quot;. On March 6, 2018, UCSB lowered their flag to honor Tobler after his death.

The journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science honored Tobler with both an obituary authored by Keith C. Clarke and a graphic composite on the cover featuring themes of his work. The journal Geographical Analysis dedicated a special issue titled &quot;In honor of Waldo Tobler&quot;, edited by Alan T. Murray and Keith C. Clarke, which contained several articles discussing his research, including discussions and overviews of Tobler&#x27;s contributions to the journal. Two of the International Cartographic Association journals, The Cartographic Journal and the International Journal of Cartography, honored Tobler with obituary articles. Geographer Mark Monmonier published an obituary for Waldo Tobler in the journal Imago Mundi.
The journals Transactions in GIS and Annals of GIS both published obituary articles in tribute to Tobler as well. The American Association of Geographers published a memorial for him on their website.

<text>Hayots Dzor (, literally &quot;the valley of the Armenians&quot;) or Eruandunik/Yervandunik (, from the name of the Orontid dynasty) was a canton (&quot;gavar&quot;) of the province of Vaspurakan of historical Armenia encompassing the area to the southeast of Lake Van, namely the valley of the Khoshab (Hoşap River). It was bordered by the cantons of Rshtunik to the southwest, Tosp to the north, and Kughanovit to the east. Armenian folk tradition holds the region to be the site of the legendary battle between the Armenian patriarch Hayk and the Babylonian ruler Bel. Hayk is said to have founded the fortress of Haykʻ or Haykaberd (traditionally identified with the ruins of the Urartian fortress of Sardurihinili) at the site of the battle, in honor of which Hayots Dzor was named. 

The inhabitants of region irrigated their fields using the Khoshab River and the Shamiram Canal, which was built during the time of the Kingdom of Urartu. Hayots Dzor was populated almost entirely by Armenians until the 1890s, when Kurdish tribes began to settle in the area following the Hamidian massacres. As of 1911, there were 12 monasteries in the region of Hayots Dzor, five of which were standing and seven of which were in ruins. Around 10,000 Armenians lived in Hayots Dzor before the Armenian genocide, when the Armenian villages were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred or deported.

<text>The Gntuni family was an ancient Armenian noble family who can be traced back to late antiquity.

== Background ==

According to Khorenatsi, the Gntuni family were believed to be of Canaanite origin and were the master of the wardrobe in Armenia. They were aspets of Nig and were centered in the city of Kasala. The earliest mentioned prince of the family was Hrodomithr, who was awarded the city by King Tiridates II.

From 914 to 921, they ruled the town of Samshvilde as vassals of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia.

<text>John Dunmore Lang (25 August 1799 – 8 August 1878) was a Scottish-born Australian Presbyterian minister, writer, historian, politician and activist. He was the first prominent advocate of an independent Australian nation and of Australian republicanism.

==Background and family==
Lang was born near Greenock, Renfrewshire (now Inverclyde), Scotland, the eldest son of William Lang and Mary Dunmore. His father was a small landowner and his mother a pious Presbyterian, who dedicated her son to the Church of Scotland ministry from an early age. He grew up in nearby Largs and was educated at the school there and at the University of Glasgow, where he excelled, winning many prizes and graduating as a Master of Arts in 1820. Stevenson McGill was his most influential teacher; he also greatly admired Thomas Chalmers. His brother, George, had found employment in New South Wales and Lang decided to join him. He was ordained by the Presbytery of Irvine on 30 September 1822. Arriving in Sydney Cove on 23 May 1823, he became the first Presbyterian minister in the colony of New South Wales. (He had come out to Hobart on , and then had sailed from Hobart to Sydney on .) On the way back from the second of his nine voyages to Britain (1830–31), he married his 18-year-old cousin, Wilhelmina Mackie, in Cape Town. They were married for 47 years and had ten children, only three of whom survived him. There were no grandchildren.

==Lang and the claims of the Church of England==
Lang found the Presbyterian Scots in New South Wales to be a small minority, dominated by an Anglican administration and outnumbered by Irish Roman Catholics. There was no Presbyterian church in the colony and he commenced building one before he had applied to the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane, to provide public funds for it. Governor Brisbane refused. Lang had laid the foundation stone for the Scots Church on 1 July 1824 and it was completed with significant debt by William and Andrew Lang and opened on 16 July 1826, with a trust deed that tied it to the Church of Scotland. Lang visited Britain during 1824–25, where he successfully lobbied the Secretary for the Colonies, Lord Bathurst, to recognise the legal status of the Church of Scotland to the extent that he was allowed a stipend of £300 per annum (current equivalent: £). During this visit, he was made a Doctor of Divinity by Glasgow University and recruited the John McGarvie for ministry at Portland Head.

Lang resisted the claim to exclusive state recognition and support by the Church of England involved in the establishment of the Clergy and School Lands Corporation in 1826. It was suspended in 1829 and abolished in 1833. Also in 1826, he claimed the right to perform marriages by virtue of a British act of Parliament of 1818 relating to the Diocese of Calcutta which protected Church of Scotland ministers there and thus broke the Church of England monopoly, with New South Wales then being part of that diocese. The Church Act of 1836 gave state-aid to the Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church on the same basis. The Methodists were added in 1839.

Lang&#x27;s views on the Church of England were evident when he published his opinions in &quot;On the Character and Influence of the Present European Population of New Zealand, as Regards the Aborigines&quot; in four &quot;Letters To the Right Hon. Earl Durham&quot; that were published in England. Lord Durham was a supporter of the New Zealand Company. The second letter was a virulent attack on the Church Missionary Society in New Zealand, which opposed the colonial aspirations of the New Zealand Company. The Church Missionary Society in New Zealand was led by Archdeacon Henry Williams.

==Educational endeavours==
Lang founded the Caledonian Academy in 1826, but it soon folded. He made a second visit to Britain in 1830–31 and recruited several teachers, as well as acquiring a library and equipment for a school he was to call the Australian College. It opened at the beginning of 1832 on land adjoining the Scots Church. It had considerable promise which was not realised due to Lang&#x27;s lack of administrative ability and his failure to achieve more general support because of his own flaws of character and ability, particularly financial mismanagement. By 1840 it had only about 30 students. In 1842 the college became simply a day school for boys meeting elsewhere and was no more by 1852. Lang dreamed of heading an educational institution of standing. He was a supporter of the Presbyterian Theological College and of St Andrew&#x27;s College within the University of Sydney, although he used his political influence to try and change the legislation and hoped in 1872 to be appointed its first principal. He was not appointed and in anger stated that St Andrew&#x27;s College was &quot;conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity and certain to become a notorious failure&quot;. His portrait does, however, continue to hang in the college&#x27;s Senior Common Room.

==Lang and journalism==
Lang returned from his third visit to Britain (1833–34) with more ministers and teachers, as well as a printing press and tradesmen to operate it. He commenced &quot;The Colonist&quot; in January 1835, which he used to promote his schemes, and attack those with whom he disagreed. While he was absent in Britain 1839–41, until it ceased in 1840, Rev William McIntyre edited the paper and it reported impartially on matters then agitating the Presbyterian Church. Lang commenced a new paper, &quot;The Colonial Observer&quot;, in October 1841, which ran until 1844. He also conducted &quot;The Press&quot; for a period in 1851.

==Lang&#x27;s theology==
Lang was certainly a turbulent Scot but was not quite the fiery fundamentalist who hated all other denominations that some have claimed. Examination of his sermon manuscripts indicate they were orthodox by the standard of the Westminster Confession of Faith as adhered to by the Church of Scotland. He was influenced by Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers and held a form of the premillennial view of the future. He related quite positively to other denominations of evangelical Protestants, particularly Congregationalists, Lutherans and Methodists. He admitted Congregationalists and Baptists to the Synod which he operated 1850–64, and in 1856 ordained two Lutherans, regarding the Lutheran questions and Confession, which he used on the occasion, as the same in substance with those of the British Presbyterians. His ecclesiastical fights were with exclusivist Anglicans, other Presbyterians and the Catholics.

==Attitude to Roman Catholics==
The traditional evangelical Protestant belief concerning the predicted Antichrist, or Man of Sin in 2 Thessalonians 2, was that: the Man of Sin was not an individual as such but a movement of error in history under the guise of friendship to Christ. Lang shared this belief and saw the Man of Sin as illustrated in the Papacy. When the immigration of poor Irish Catholics was running at a massive level, he campaigned against Irish migration. His fear was that the colony would be swamped by such persons and that Protestant and British liberties would be lost. In 1841 he published &quot;The Question of Questions! or, Is this Colony to be transformed into a Province of Popedom? A Letter to the Protestant Landholders of New South Wales&quot;, and in 1847 he followed up with, &quot;Popery in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere: and How to Check it Effectually: An Address to Evangelical and Influential Protestants of all Denominations in Great Britain and Ireland&quot;. He strongly opposed Caroline Chisholm&#x27;s campaign to sponsor the immigration of single Irish Catholic women to Australia. But, as Bridges states: &quot;Lang considered opposition to harmful errors of Catholicism part of his duty as a minister but he consistently championed the cause of Irish and Catholic civil liberties and deprecated any incitement to Protestant-Catholic or Anglo-Celtic disturbances.&quot; He visited Archbishop Polding when the Roman Catholic leader was dying in 1877.

Despite his bitter anti-Catholicism, his political ideas won him wide support among the Irish Catholic population, who shared his dislike of English and Anglican dominance. In return, he supported Home Rule for Ireland – partly because he thought this would reduce the Irish Catholic influence in British government.

==Lang and the Presbyterian Church==
The Presbytery of New South Wales (which then included what is now Victoria and Queensland) was formed on 14 December 1832, despite the intemperate habits of two of the ministers, and the opposition of John McGarvie, who had turned out to be a Scottish Moderate. This Presbytery ordained a minister for Launceston and in turn the Presbytery of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land was constituted on 6 November 1835 by Lang and two others.

The Presbytery in New South Wales had a number of unsuitable ministers. Lang determined on a further visit to Britain in 1836, securing about 20 men from the Church of Scotland and from the Synod of Ulster. Lang had a pre-arranged plan to set up a rival church court to the Presbytery. When he returned in 1837 he found that an Act to regulate the temporal affairs of the Presbytery had been secured from the Government, the terms of which made the Presbytery the only legal representative of the Church of Scotland in the colony. The Presbytery Moderator&#x27;s certificate was necessary for payment of stipends under the Church Act. Lang thereupon represented the Temporalities Act as &#x27;monstrous and disgraceful in the highest degree&#x27; and having the effect of forcing him and his supporters out. This was complete fabrication, but Lang and five of the new recruits joined in constituting a Synod on 11 December 1837. Lang placed men in the same localities as Presbytery ministers to draw off adherents and drive out the drunkards. A full-blown schism operated until union was effected in 1840.

The Presbytery expelled Lang for schism on 18 January 1838. Lang used &quot;The Colonist&quot; to spread contention. As James Forbes put it, &#x27;week after week he poured forth vollies of abuse against the Presbytery, unequalled for satanic bitterness and vulgar scurrility, by the worst of the London Sunday papers.&#x27; Lang was on a further trip to Britain and America 1839–41, and in his absence terms of union were agreed and the union consummated on 5 October 1840 under the name &#x27;Synod of Australia in connection with the Established Church of Scotland.&#x27; The Basis did not give the Church of Scotland any legislative or judicial jurisdiction, but the Synod was committed to the same doctrinal basis as the Church of Scotland. Presbyteries were created subject to the Synod. Lang was admitted on his return in March 1841.

In 1840 Lang published a substantial volume entitled &quot;Religion and Education in America&quot; in which he advocated support of churches by voluntary givings rather than the State, and went so far as to advocate no connection between Church and State. This conflicted with the official views of the Church of Scotland as set out in the Confession of Faith, which can be summarised thus: (1) Church and State are distinct and separate institutions, both being accountable to the Lord Jesus Christ who has received all authority in heaven and earth from the Father; (2) the mutually helpful relationship between Church and State does not imply subordination of one to the other in its own sphere; and, in particular, the civil authorities have no jurisdiction or authoritative control in the spiritual affairs of Christ&#x27;s Church. (3) In maintaining these Scriptural principles, and the ideal of a united Christian Church in a Christian nation, the Church does not regard the involvement of the State in matters concerning religion as &quot;ipso facto&quot; contrary to liberty of conscience. Rather, she rejects intolerance or persecution as methods of advancing the kingdom of God, and recognises the individual&#x27;s liberty of conscience and the right of private judgement.

Lang&#x27;s views brought opposition from many including some who had previously supported him. Lang&#x27;s repute had already declined in Scotland. When he was censured for allowing to preach in Scot&#x27;s Church a Congregational minister who had been rejected by the Synod, he reacted negatively. On 6 February 1842 he told his congregation that he would go to New Zealand and be supported by voluntary givings. In an extraordinary blast of invective, and alluding to the narrative of Joshua 6:20ff, he said that the Australian church could not prosper until she renounced with indignant scorn the &quot;Babylonish garment&quot; of an infidel establishment of religion and abandoned the wedge of gold that corrupted all who touched it. At length he consented to remain when the bulk of the 500 adults in his congregation agreed to sever all connection with the Synod and with the State. On 8 October 1842 the Synod deposed Lang for slander – calling the Synod a synagogue of Satan particularly displeased the brethren – divisive courses and contumacy by an 8–4 vote. Ultimately, on 9 September 1851, the Presbytery of Irvine in Scotland declared Lang no longer a minister of the Church of Scotland, but did not tell Lang what was afoot nor give him an opportunity to defend himself.

Lang tried with minimal success to start a new body. In July 1846 he set off again for Britain returning in March 1850. He and two other ministers set up the Synod of New South Wales (the second of this name) on 3 April 1850, although the minutes term it &quot;The Australian Presbyterian Church&quot;. During its life of some 14 years, 31 ministers were connected with it at one time or another, including 8 of the 20 brought out by Lang in 1850. It was very loose in approach. Some have regarded it as an attempt to establish a comprehensive evangelical Protestant body, but it appears more an attempt by Lang to maintain a useful power base and maintain his own ego. In 1858, Lang recruited John Reid (the father of future prime minister George Reid) from a Melbourne congregation to serve as his associate. They shared the preaching duties and divided the pastoral duties between them, although Lang remained the church&#x27;s sole leader. They eventually fell out and Reid moved on to another congregation. By November 1864, there were four ministers (including Lang) connected with the church.

Lang was out of the mainstream from 1842, but his political influence was such that he had to be accommodated if union of the three Presbyterian streams was to be achieved. The original Synod of Australia did not wish to recognise Lang, despite having to recall the deposition in 1863 (which was done by a majority of one vote), following Lang securing the reversal of the Presbytery of Irvine&#x27;s sentence in 1861. Lang&#x27;s Synod lost its identity by being merged on 15 November 1864 with the majority of the Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia, to form a General Synod which then merged with the original Synod of Australia to form the &quot;Presbyterian Church of New South Wales&quot; on 8 September 1865 with 47 ministers. In 1872 he was chosen Moderator of the Assembly but used his speech to seriously criticise his brethren for not choosing him earlier. There wasn&#x27;t too much mellowing as he grew older.

As a churchman Lang was wilful, egotistical, not respectable (twice jailed for libel). He &#x27;preached more of the Gospel than he practised&#x27;, someone quipped. From the Presbyterian viewpoint Lang is therefore something of an ambiguous figure. James Forbes, writing in 1846 about the 1837 period, stated: &#x27;...it has ever appeared to us one of the most mysterious permissions of Divine Providence, that the founding of an infant church in an infant colony should have fallen into such hands.&#x27;

==Lang and politics==
In &quot;The Colonist&quot; Lang agitated for the end of transportation, for the separation of the Moreton Bay Colony (which he proposed to be called Cooksland, but was eventually called Queensland) and the Port Phillip District (which he proposed to be called Phillipsland, but was eventually called Victoria) from New South Wales, and for the establishment of representative government and the reduction in the powers of the British-appointed Governors.

In 1843 Lang was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council as one of five representatives of the Electoral district of Port Phillip, holding his seat until 1847. From July 1850 to October 1851, Lang was one of the Council members for City of Sydney, and in 1854 he was elected to the Council for County of Stanley.
 Lang was MLA for West Sydney from 1859 to 1869. Lang was not suited to parliamentary life, since he was temperamentally opposed to parliamentary procedure. He frequently used parliamentary privilege to pursue personal vendettas against his many enemies in the Presbyterian Church and the press.

In 1851, in any case, he was unable to take his seat in Parliament, since he was heavily in debt from his various failed migration schemes and was being pressed by creditors. He was sued for debt, and when he attacked his creditors in the press he was prosecuted for libel, and sentenced to a 100-pound fine and four months imprisonment in Parramatta Gaol. He was imprisoned again in 1855, when his son George, manager of the Ballarat branch of the Bank of New South Wales, was convicted of embezzlement. Lang attacked the judge in print and was sentenced to six months imprisonment for criminal libel. Ten thousand people signed a petition for his release, but he served the full sentence.

By 1850 Lang, inspired by the Chartist movement in Britain and by the 1848 revolution in France, had become a radical democrat and a republican. With Henry Parkes and James Wilshire he founded the Australian League political party, although he soon quarrelled with his fellow-founders. He put forward ideas which were both visionary and radical – the federation of the Australian colonies, the establishment of a fully democratic government (at a time when both in Britain and Australia the franchise was restricted to owners of property) and an Australian republic. These ideas reflected both the Presbyterian ideal of congregational self-government (despite the fact that in church affairs he was an autocrat) and his Scottish nationalist dislike of English and Anglican supremacy.

In 1850 Lang published &quot;The Coming Event! Or, the United Provinces of Australia&quot; in which he predicted an independent Australian federal republic. He followed this in 1852 with &quot;Freedom and Independence for the Golden Lands of Australia&quot;, his best-known work. The title of this work has become an established slogan of political radicalism and republicanism in Australia. His relation to the political union of 1901 is, however, ambiguous. By 1875 Lang had rejected his earlier &#x27;continental&#x27; vision of a federated, self-governing Australia, in favour of confining the claim of &#x27;freedom and independence&#x27; to New South Wales, Queensland, &#x27;Capricornia&#x27; (northern Queensland) and &#x27;Carpentaria&#x27;.

Lang was an enthusiastic promoter of the development of the Australian colonies. In 1834 he published in Britain the first edition of &quot;An Historical and Statistical Account of New South Wales, both as a Penal Colony and as a British Colony&quot;, which ran through a series of editions until his death, to promote immigration and investment in Australia. The &quot;Westminster Review&quot; commented that the book should have been called &quot;A History of Dr. Lang to which is added a History of New South Wales&quot;&#x27;. He also published &quot;Port-Phillip, or the colony of Victoria&quot; in 1853, and &quot;Queensland, Australia&quot; in 1861 to promote the northern colony. In 1849, three immigrant ships (, &quot;Chaseley&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;) sponsored by Lang arrived in Moreton Bay with approximately 600 immigrants all personally selected by Lang. Lang Park in Brisbane is named after him in recognition of his work promoting the colony.

Despite their eccentricity, Lang&#x27;s works were influential in promoting Australia, but his practical schemes for immigration were usually fiascos owing to his lack of business sense. After 1851, in any case, immigration to Australia boomed due to the Gold Rush and had no need of promotion.

Lang&#x27;s influence should not be underestimated but was marred by his wilful personality. As well, the wave of radicalism in Britain and Australia of the mid-19th century soon passed and was succeeded by an era of enthusiasm for the British Empire. But he has become an iconic figure in Australian history for his advocacy of Australian nationalism, federation, full political democracy and republicanism. Lang is the namesake of Dunmore Lang College, at Macquarie University in Sydney.

Lang&#x27;s writings are voluminous, his activities multifarious. His power of description is remarkable, his assessments of individuals generally perceptive if tinged with his own prejudices. His egotism defies belief but his achievements are quite astonishing and overshadow his religious contribution. Excluding his newspaper articles his published work runs to some 10,000 pages.

Lang died on 8 August 1878 in Sydney following a stroke. His funeral, on 10 August, was &quot;one of the largest that has taken place in the Australian colonies&quot; – a funeral procession over a mile in length, led by 500 Chinese, with perhaps 70,000 people lining the streets. His wife died in 1888, and the last of his children in 1934. There were no grandchildren.

<text>Pontevico (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia in Lombardy. It is on the left bank of the river Oglio. As of 2021 Pontevico had a population of 7,038.

== Toponymy ==

The name &quot;Pontevico&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;Pontis Vicus&quot;, which means &quot;town of the bridge&quot;, because the bridge had a great strategic importance: crossed by the &quot;Via Brixiana&quot; and built on the Oglio river, it connects the province of Brescia to the Cremona&#x27;s.

== History ==
Before the Roman-Gallic wars, Pontevico was inhabited by the Cisalpine Gauls. However, the town was probably founded under the Roman Empire: looking at the town from above, the centuriation of the original nucleus is clearly visible. Pontevico was crossed by the &quot;Via Brixiana&quot;, a Roman consular road which connected Cremona &quot;(lat&quot;. &quot;Cremona&quot;) to Brescia (&quot;lat. Brixia&quot;), from which Roman roads passed and then branched out towards the entire Cisalpine Gaul.

In the 6th century the navigation had a high importance, so Theodoric imposed a removal of the fishing equipment along the river to not impede the passage of boats. Due to the Magyars invasions, between the 9th and 10th century a castle in the town was built, called &quot;munitissimum castrum&quot; due to its great size.

Until the 13th century, the town was divided into the New and the Old ones&quot;,&quot; which had its own church and its own castle. In this period, there were opened the first hospices for pilgrims and the sick. Since 1170, the &quot;Hospitale&quot; is still present today, which gives the name to its street.

During the High Middle Ages, Pontevico immediately sided with Guelphs and its castle became the theater of battles between the two factions. In 1237, in the eve of the Battle of Cortenuova, the Guelph army was camped in the local fortress but it made the mistake of leaving the castle, leaving uncovered the left bank of the Oglio river. So, Federico II could pass the river and he entered in the castle, starting his march to Cortenuova.

Until the Wars in Lombardy, Pontevico was a part of the Duchy of Milan, when in 1426 it got conquered by the Republic of Venice. In the last phase of the wars, in 1452 Francesco Sforza regained the town after a two days-siege, but the next year Jacopo Piccinino brought back Pontevico under the &quot;Serenissima&quot;. The decisive clash was between 16 and 19 October 1453: the Duke of Milan&#x27;s army conjoined with the Renè of Anjou&#x27;s, King of Naples, one for a total of 20,000 infantrymans and 3,500 knights; after three days of siege, Pontevico fell under the Milanese army. Then, the town was razed to the ground and especially the French soldiers were very heavy with the population. However, the town after the Treaty of Lodi was brought back under the Republic of Venice which rebuilt Pontevico and its castle.

Under the Venetian rule Pontevico was a very important port and stronghold for the &quot;Serenissima&quot; which granted privileges to the town which were named &quot;Curia&quot;, &quot;Castello&quot; and &quot;Borgo&quot;. In the local port there was a trading station where colonial products were sold and fodder, linen, iron and wood was imported.

Due to the big importance which Venetians gave to Pontevico, its inhabitants especially during the War of the League of Cambrai proved to be very loyal to the Republic, to the point of organizing a revolt against the French where &quot;Serenissima&quot; was alone against France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, in 1510. During that war, in april 1509 Venice, alone against Papal States, Kingdom of France, Holy Roman Empire and Spanish Empire, decided to reunite an army of about 50,000 soldiers right in Pontevico, whose Castle hosted the leaders of Venetian Army - Niccolò Orsini, Andrea Gritti and Bartolomeo di Alviano.

During this period, in Pontevico the weekly market was established (1559) and an abbey church was built (1584). In 1630, due to the plague of 1629, the local noble Francesco Capparino founded the &quot;Pio Luogo Poveri&quot;.

With the fall of the Republic of Venice (1797) and the disappearance of the fluvial market, caused by the appearance of the rail transport, the town during the 19th century experienced a phase of decline and the agriculture became the main activity. Due to this transformation, the poverty and the pellagra were very widespread. To solve this problem, during this period on the territory were founded lots of charitable organizations, the biggest one was the &quot;Istituto per Frenasteriche ed Epilettiche&quot; (1901), founded by Bassano Cremonesini and placed in the castle and still operating.

The town industrialization was so low and the first important industrial center was opened in 1908: it was called &quot;Società Filatura di Lino e Canape&quot;. But the mass industrialization only occurred during the Italian economic miracle. However the first factory got closed in 1956, in the 1960s its area became an artisan settlement.

Then, between the 1960s and the 1970s, the town expansion began (which still continues) when modern neighborhoods and numerous public works were created: the municipal library (1970), the methane network, the new nursery school (1977) and the new primary one (1983), the new and bigger aqueduct, later placed side by side to the wastewater purifier (1986) and the sports center with palasport (1980). During this years, the castle, which was destroyed in 1844 and transformed into a tenement, was profoundly restored and brought back to his medieval form. But are also dated back to that period the closure of the &quot;Ospedale Civile Gorno Ruffoni&quot;, an important hospital located in the Frazione of Chiesuola, in 1977 and the crash of the bridge on the Oglio river, which fell in the same year and was rebuilt in 1978.

* Santa Maria in Ripa d&#x27;Oglio: the oldest church and still standing building in Pontevico, built when Pontevico, at that time still called &quot;Pontis Vicus&quot;, was under roman rule. Under the buildings there&#x27;s an early christian baptistery made during the 5th century.
* Hospitale: an hospital built in 1170 near the defensive wall of the town, still operating as a nursing home called &quot;Hospice&quot;. The street in front of its main access is still called &quot;via Ospitale&quot;.

<text>A medical degree is a professional degree admitted to those who have passed coursework in the fields of medicine and/or surgery from an accredited medical school. Obtaining a degree in medicine allows for the recipient to continue on into specialty training with the end goal of securing a license to practice within their respective jurisdiction. Medical graduates may also pursue non-clinical careers including those in basic research and positions within the healthcare industry.
A worldwide study conducted in 2011 indicated on average: 64 university exams, 130 series exams, and 174 assignments are completed over the course of 5.5 years. As a baseline, students need greater than an 85% in prerequisite courses to enrol for the aptitude test in these degree programs.
