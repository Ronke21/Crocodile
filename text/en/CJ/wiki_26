<text>Sanerivi &quot;Sani&quot; Sagala (born 24 August 1974), better known by his stage name Dei Hamo, is a New Zealand rapper, producer and director.

Dei Hamo, which can be translated as &quot;The Samoan&quot;, has won various awards for his chart-topping music and his first album &quot;First Edition&quot;, released in 2005. He lives in Māngere, Auckland.

== Background ==
Dei Hamo&#x27;s musical career spans more than 15 years. He was part of the Proud hip hop tour and has worked with some of New Zealand&#x27;s top musicians and performers, including Boh Runga, Tha Feelstyle and DJ Sammy B. He has supported a number of international acts including The Black Eyed Peas and Busta Rhymes.

Dei Hamo went to Aorere College, Papatoetoe in the late 1980s where he was first exposed to the hip hop genre. Hamo spent his days and nights perfecting his craft, later claiming to have written a song a day.

Having a passion for film and directing, in 2010 he was asked by a close friend Amy Raumati (also known as Lady Sheeq) to direct a music video for her. Dei Hamo agreed and has since directed music videos for other artists. He directs the music videos under his real name, Sani Sagala, as he aims to write and direct movies in the near future.

== Music ==
In 2004, Dei Hamo&#x27;s first single &quot;We Gon&#x27; Ride&quot; spent five consecutive weeks at number one on New Zealand&#x27;s music chart, and three months in the top 10. The track went platinum. It also reached the top 40 in Australia. Later singles have included &quot;This Is My Life&quot; and &quot;Cry again&quot;, the latter containing lyrics from Split Enz&#x27;s song &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; performed by Tim Finn.

<text>The 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army&#x27;s Territorial Army (TA) that was formed in 1920 and existed through the Second World War, although it did not see combat. The division had originally been raised in 1908 as the West Lancashire Division, part of the British Army&#x27;s Territorial Force (TF). It fought in the First World War, as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, and demobilised following the fighting. In 1920, the 55th (West Lancashire) Division started to reform. It was stationed in the county of Lancashire throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and was under-funded and under-staffed. In the late 1930s, the division was reduced from three to two infantry brigades and gave up some artillery and other support units to become a motorised formation, the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division. This was part of a British Army doctrine change that was intended to increase battlefield mobility.

Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the division created new units around cadres of its own personnel, a process called &quot;duplicating&quot;. The division then used these new formations to create its &quot;duplicate&quot;, the 59th (Staffordshire) Motor Division. The 55th remained in the United Kingdom, in a defensive role, after the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940, following the Battle of France, the motor division concept was abandoned. The division regained its third infantry brigade, and became the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. It remained within the United Kingdom, training for future operations as well as training replacements for combat units, and assigned to anti-invasion duties. By 1944, the division had been drained of many of its assets. The remnant of the division was used in Operation Fortitude, a deception effort that supported the Allied invasion of France. At the end of the war, the division was demobilised and not reformed.

==Background==
The West Lancashire Division was formed in 1908, following the passing of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 that created the Territorial Force (TF). The division was broken up between 1914 and 1915, to provide reinforcements for the British Expeditionary Force that was fighting in France during the First World War. It was reformed as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division in late 1915, deployed to the Western Front and fought during the Battles of the Somme, Passchendaele, and Estaires, and took part in the Hundred Days Offensive. During two years of war, 63,923 men served in the division, over half becoming casualties. Following the end of the war, in 1918, and through 1919, the division was demobilised. In April 1920, the division started the process of reforming in Lancashire, as part of Western Command. In 1921, the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) following the passage of the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921.

==Interwar period==
The 55th (West Lancashire) Division was headquartered and primarily based in Liverpool, although it had units throughout Lancashire. At various times units were located in Chester, Lancaster, Lichfield, Seaforth, Southport, and Warrington. The division was reformed with the 164th (North Lancashire), the 165th (Liverpool), and the 166th (South Lancashire and Cheshire) Infantry Brigades. On 19 July 1924, the division was reviewed by George V, during a visit to Liverpool. During the interwar period, TA formations and units were only permitted to recruit up to 60 per cent of their establishment. Due to chronic underfunding, the lack of a pressing national threat, and a diminished level of prestige associated with serving in the TA, it was rare for units to reach even this level of manpower. By the 1930s, this resulted in the TA having limited access to modern equipment, under-trained men, and officers with inadequate experience in command.

===Motor division===
The development of British military doctrine during the interwar period resulted in three types of division by the end of the 1930s: the infantry division; the mobile division (later called the armoured division); and the motor division. Historian David French wrote &quot;the main role of the infantry ... was to break into the enemy&#x27;s defensive position.&quot; This would then be exploited by the mobile division, followed by the motor divisions that would &quot;carry out the rapid consolidation of the ground captured by the mobile divisions&quot; therefore &quot;transform[ing] the &#x27;break-in&#x27; into a &#x27;break-through&#x27;.&quot; French wrote that the motor division had a similar role to the German Army&#x27;s motorised and light divisions, &quot;but there the similarities ended.&quot; German motorised divisions contained three regiments (akin to a British brigade) and were equipped similarly to a regular infantry division, while their smaller light divisions contained a tank battalion. The British motor division, while being fully motorised and capable of transporting all their infantry, was &quot;otherwise much weaker than normal infantry divisions&quot; or their German counterparts as it was made up of only two brigades, had two artillery regiments as opposed to an infantry division&#x27;s three, and contained no tanks.

In 1938, the army decided to create six motor divisions from TA units. Only three infantry divisions were converted before the war, including the 55th (West Lancashire). This resulted in the removal of infantry and artillery elements from the division. Many of the division&#x27;s battalions were converted to new roles, and transferred to other branches of the army. For example: the 6th Liverpool Rifles were retrained and transferred to the Royal Engineers (RE), becoming the 38th (The King&#x27;s Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE; the 5th King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) was converted to artillery, becoming the 56th (King&#x27;s Own) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery; the 7th King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) became the 40th (The King&#x27;s) Royal Tank Regiment. The division retained three brigades until March 1939, when the 164th Brigade was disbanded, bringing the division into line with the intention of the new organisation. Now the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division, it comprised the 165th (Liverpool) and the 166th (South Lancashire and Cheshire) Infantry Brigades.

===Rearmament===

During the 1930s, tensions increased between Germany and the United Kingdom and its allies. In late 1937 and throughout 1938, German demands for the annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia led to an international crisis. To avoid war, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to annexe the Sudetenland. Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between the two countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.

On 29 March, British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions. The plan was for existing TA divisions, referred to as the first-line, to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form a new division, known as the second-line, from cadres around which the new divisions could be expanded. This process was dubbed &quot;duplicating&quot;. The 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division provided cadres to create a second line &quot;duplicate&quot; formation, which became the 59th (Staffordshire) Motor Division. By September, the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division had also reformed the 164th Brigade. Despite the intention for the army to grow, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process and a lack of facilities, equipment and instructors. In April 1939, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 men, all aged 20, were conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. It had been envisioned by the War Office that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months. The process varied widely between the TA divisions. Some were ready in weeks while others had made little progress by the time the Second World War began on 1 September.

==Second World War==
===Home defence===

On 4 September, the division established the second line duplicate of the 166th Brigade, the 177th. On 15 September, the 166th Infantry Brigade (renamed the 176th Infantry Brigade) and the 177th Brigade were transferred to the 59th (Staffordshire) Motor Division. This left the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division with the 164th and 165th Brigades. The former consisted of the 9th Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool), the 1/4th Battalion, the South Lancashire Regiment, and the 2/4th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment. The 165th Brigade was made up of the 5th Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool), and the 1st and the 2nd Battalions, Liverpool Scottish (Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders). Major-General Vivian Majendie was the division&#x27;s general officer commanding (GOC), and had been in command since 1938.

The division&#x27;s initial war-time duties included deploying guards to the docks at Birkenhead, the Port of Liverpool, and the naval defences at Crosby, while also assisting the civilian authorities during air raids. On 6 September, the division fired its first shots of the war. Divisional anti-aircraft and machine guns fired on three aircraft flying low over the River Mersey. The shots missed, and the aircraft were later determined to be Royal Air Force Handley Page Hampden bombers.

The war deployment plan for the TA envisioned its divisions being sent overseas, as equipment became available, to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions in waves as its divisions completed their training, the final divisions deploying a year after the war began. In October 1939, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, General Walter Kirke, was tasked with drawing up a plan, codenamed Julius Caesar, to defend the United Kingdom from a potential German invasion. As part of this plan, the division was assigned to Home Forces&#x27; reserve. It was transferred to Northern Command and moved to Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire. Here the division furthered its training, while also having to be ready to act as a counter-attack force for Julius Caesar in case of a German invasion between the Humber and The Wash. Other duties included the protection of RAF Finningley.

In January 1940, the division was used to obtain drafts for formations overseas as well as volunteers to man anti-aircraft guns on small ships. In March, the division was relieved as a reserve formation. It was assigned to Eastern Command the following month, and transferred to defend the coastline of Suffolk and then Essex. These moves were part of a larger effort by Kirke to reinforce the defences in the east of England, which he believed would be the location most in danger of an invasion as a result of the German operations on mainland Europe. Other than coastal defence, the division was also responsible for guarding Ipswich Airport, constructing roadblocks inland from potential invasion beaches, and providing mobile detachments to respond to any German airborne landings. In April, following the start of the Norwegian campaign, the division organised No. 4 Independent Company, which departed for Norway on 7 May. Following the conclusion of that campaign, many of these men joined the Commandos. As a result of the German victory in France and the return of the BEF following the Dunkirk evacuation, the division was not deployed overseas per the original TA deployment timeline.

The British Army began implementing lessons learnt from the campaign in France. This included a decision to base the standard division around three brigades, and the abandonment of the motor division concept. This process involved breaking up four-second-line territorial divisions to reinforce depleted formations and aid in transforming the Army&#x27;s five motor divisions, each made up of two brigades, into infantry divisions made up of three brigades. As part of this process, on 23 June, the 66th Infantry Division was disbanded. This freed up the 199th Infantry Brigade and an artillery regiment to be transferred to the 55th (West Lancashire) Motor Division, which became the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. General Edmund Ironside, who had replaced Kirke, believed the division (along with the others which had remained in the UK) to be insufficiently trained, equipped, and unable to undertake offensive operations. The division was therefore assigned a static coastal defence role in Essex, while leaving enough troops available to deal with any German paratrooper landings that may occur in its area. Duties also included the digging and improving of defensive positions, and ongoing training. On paper, an infantry division was to have seventy-two 25-pounder field guns. By 31 May, the division only had eight such modern guns. These were supplemented by four First World War-vintage 18-pounder field guns, and eight howitzers of similar vintage. The division had only two anti-tank guns, against a nominal establishment of 48, and only 47 of the required 307 Boys anti-tank rifles. General Alan Brooke, who replaced Ironside, reviewed the division on 1 August. He recorded in his diary that the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division &quot;should be quite good with a bit of training.&quot;

The division remained in Essex until November 1940, when it was assigned to IV Corps. This was a reserve formation, based away from the coast, the intended role being to counterattack German landings in East Anglia. Elements of the division moved to more central locations, for example the two Liverpool Scottish battalions took up winter quarters in Oxfordshire. While based there, they conducted training in a counterattack role that involved moving to concentration areas behind units based along the south and southeast coasts. In February 1941, the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division moved south to defend the Sussex coast. This included manning coastal defensive positions, being assigned to hunt down any German paratroopers, improving and expanding defences in their sector, and training. With the arrival of increased levels of ammunition, the men of the division were able to considerably improve their proficiency in the use of small arms and mortars. On 1 June 1941, Major-General William Duthie Morgan replaced Majendie as GOC. In July, the division was relieved from coastal defence. It relocated to Aldershot to act as a reserve formation, and increased the tempo of training. Morgan maintained his position until October, when he was wounded during a training exercise, and was replaced by Major-General Frederick Morgan. During the final months of 1941, the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division started to provide drafts of men to other formations. This was followed by the division being placed on the lower establishment in January 1942. In December 1941, the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division relocated to Yorkshire and was reassigned to Northern Command, and was spread out with troops based in the East Riding of Yorkshire and North Yorkshire. The intention of this deployment was to counter-attack any German landings along the coast or at nearby airfields. The 165th Brigade also spent some time at Catterick Garrison. During its stay with Northern Command, the majority of the time was spent training, from the battalion to the brigade level. The division relocated to Devon in January 1943, and was assigned to the South West District. The primary role now was to counter any raids conducted by German forces along the coast. This was in addition to continued training, guarding vulnerable points, and rendering assistance to nearby civilian authorities as needed after air raids. In June, the division lost five men killed following a German bombing raid. In December 1943, the division received drafts from anti-aircraft regiments. These men were then given a ten-week training course to make them viable drafts for infantry units. The same month, the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division transferred to Northern Ireland, under the command of British Troops Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the soldiers aided farmers, helped train elements of the reforming Belgian Army, and trained with newly arrived troops from the United States Army. The division continued to provide men to other formations through 1944.

===Wind down and deception===

In May 1944, the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division was raised to higher establishment. The division did not increase in size; the war establishment (the paper strength) of a higher establishment infantry division, in this period, was 18,347 men. The 55th (West Lancashire), the 38th (Welsh), the 45th, the 47th (London), and the 61st Infantry Divisions had a combined total of 17,845 men. The division remained within the United Kingdom and was drained of manpower to a point that it was all but disbanded, and was then maintained as a deception formation. Of these 17,845 men, around 13,000 were available as replacements for the 21st Army Group fighting in France. The remaining 4,800 men were considered ineligible at that time for service abroad for a variety of reasons, including a lack of training or being medically unfit. Over the following six months, up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st Army Group following the completion of their training and certification of fitness. For example, the two Liverpool Scottish battalions were used as training units and a source of reinforcements for other Scottish regiments. Entire units were also stripped from the division and deployed abroad; the 2nd Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) (previously the 10th Battalion, Loyal Regiment) was transferred to Italy. While the 199th Brigade remained part of the division, it was attached to Northern Ireland District in July 1944. The same month, the division, minus the 199th Brigade, returned to the mainland and moved to southern Wales. The 199th Brigade, renumbered the 166th Brigade, physically rejoined the division in June 1945. In April 1945, the 304th and the 305th Infantry Brigades were attached to the division. These were recently converted anti-aircraft formations. The latter remained with the division for seventeen days, before being sent to the 21st Army Group. The former stayed with the division into May, and then deployed to Norway.

In the final months of 1943 and through June 1944, the division&#x27;s actual and notional moves were deliberately leaked by double agents as part of the &quot;Fortitude North&quot; segment of the Operation Fortitude deception, the effort to make the Germans believe that the notional 250,000-strong Fourth Army, based in Scotland, would assault Norway. The division was assigned to the fictional II Corps, which was notionally preparing to assault Stavanger. The division participated in this deception effort by maintaining wireless signals suggesting it was moving around the United Kingdom as part of the Fourth Army. The overall ruse of an attack on Norway was maintained through July 1944, the plan officially coming to an end in September. Historian Mary Barbier wrote &quot;the evidence seems to indicate that [Fortitude North] was only partially successful&quot; and &quot;a heated debate has erupted over whether or not [the operation] was a success.&quot;

The division then joined the II Corps&#x27;s notional move south from Scotland to England, in June 1944, becoming part of &quot;Fortitude South&quot; to convince the Germans that the Normandy landings were a feint and the main Allied invasion would take place in the Pas-de-Calais with a force of 500,000 men. The deception aimed to persuade the Germans not to move the 18 divisions of the 15th Army from the Pas-de-Calais to Normandy. The division also provided the signal and headquarters staff to create the phantom 55th US Infantry Division. In July, the division was reported as an assault division training near Southampton. In September, as the &quot;Fortitude&quot; deception was wound down and the Fourth Army dispersed, it was allowed to be known that the division had reverted to a training role. Historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the Germans readily believed in the threat to the Pas de Calais and &quot;it was only at the end of July&quot; that they realised a second assault was not coming, and &quot;by that time, it was too late to move reinforcements&quot;. Nevertheless, Barbier concludes &quot;that the importance of the deception has been overrated&quot;. The 15th Army was largely immobile, and not combat-ready. Despite the deception, several German divisions, including the 1st SS Panzer Division in reserve behind the 15th Army, were transferred to Normandy. The Germans had realised, as early as May, that the threat to Normandy was real. Barbier concluded that while the Germans believed the deception due to &quot;preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais&quot;, the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception in causing the inaction of the 15th Army, because they also held a &quot;preconceived notion of what [Operation Fortitude] would accomplish&quot;.

The British army demobilised after the war. The TA was reformed in 1947, on a much smaller scale of nine divisions and did not include the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. In 1947, the division&#x27;s insignia was temporarily adopted by the 87th Army Group Royal Artillery, but was replaced at some point before the unit was disbanded in 1955. This formation was based in Liverpool and was made up primarily of units from the West Lancashire area, creating a connection with the division.

<text>Be&#x27;er Sheva Park is a small park located on Lake Washington in the Rainier Beach neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. Dedicated in 1905 as Atlantic City Park after the subdivision, it was renamed after Beer Sheva, Israel, in 1977, to honor Seattle&#x27;s new sister city. In Beer Sheva, Israel, a &quot;Seattle Park&quot; was made in honor of Seattle&#x27;s gesture.

The Rainier Beach community began upgrading the park in 2017 through local charitable efforts. In 2023, a various group of community members, the Seattle Parks Foundation, and local businesses and non-profits began raising funds for a $2.5 million renovation to the park. Considered a first of several phases of improvements, the plans include access to the waterfront, art installations, a boardwalk and lighted paths, and a stage for cultural performances. , additional phases comprise shoreline habitat improvements and a playground.

Mecklenburg was renamed as the &quot;Midland District&quot; in 1792.

It was combined with Lennox County and Amherst Island in 1800 to become the incorporated counties of Lennox and Addington. The counties would regain their separate identities in 1845, but would continue to be united for electoral purposes. The newly surveyed township of Anglesea was added to Addington at that time. The township of Kaladar was also included, having been added to the incorporated counties in 1821.

At the beginning of 1850, Midland District was abolished, and the United Counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. In 1860, Lennox and Addington were formally amalgamated as the County of Lennox and Addington.

<doc id="1088523" wikidata="Q1050841" url="?curid=1088523" title="Cathbad">
<text>Cathbad () or Cathbhadh (modern spelling) is the chief druid in the court of King Conchobar mac Nessa in the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology.

He features in both accounts of Conchobar&#x27;s birth, in one of which he is the king&#x27;s father. In the first, Nessa, daughter of Eochaid Sálbuide, the then king of Ulster, asks the druid what it is an auspicious time for (as he had the ability to foretell the future). Cathbad replies, &quot;for begetting a king on a queen&quot;. There were no other men around, so Ness takes Cathbad to bed and conceives a son.

In the second version, Cathbad, who is a leader of a band of &quot;fianna&quot; (landless warriors) as well as a druid, attacks Ness&#x27;s foster-fathers&#x27; house, killing all 12 of them. Because the culprit cannot be identified, Eochaid is powerless to do anything about it, so Ness forms her own band of 27 &quot;fianna&quot; to track him down. However, one day, when she goes off on her own to bathe, Cathbad comes upon her alone and unarmed, and demands her as his wife. She has no choice but to agree, and Cathbad rapes her. However, in this version, Ness&#x27;s child is the son of her lover, High King Fachtna Fáthach, not Cathbad&#x27;s. Ness goes into labour, and Cathbad tells her if she can manage not to give birth until the following day, her son will be a great king and have everlasting fame. Ness sits on a flagstone by the river Conchobar and the following morning gives birth. The baby falls into the river, but Cathbad lifts him out, names him Conchobar after the river, and brings him up as his own son.

The druid was also present at the birth of Deirdre and prophesied her tragic fate, but Conchobar ignored him. On another occasion, the young Cú Chulainn overheard Cathbad prophesies that anyone who took arms on that day would have everlasting fame but a short life; he immediately ran to Conchobar and asked to be armed.

<doc id="1088528" wikidata="Q843997" url="?curid=1088528" title="Tokyo Disneyland">
<text>(local nickname &quot;TDL&quot;) is a theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo. Its main gate is directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland Station. It was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by WED Enterprises in the same style as Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida. It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses intellectual property from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.

The park has seven themed areas: the World Bazaar, Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, Critter Country and Toontown. Many of these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Fantasyland includes Peter Pan&#x27;s Flight, Snow White&#x27;s Scary Adventures, and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, based on Disney films and characters. The park is noted for its extensive open spaces to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park. In 2023, Tokyo Disneyland hosted 15.1 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited theme park in the world and the second-most visited theme park in Asia.

==History==
The idea of a Japanese Disneyland dates back to the late 1950s when Japanese businessman Kunizo Matsuo approached Walt Disney with the idea of a Disney park in Nara. While it is rumored Walt initially agreed to the idea, he later dropped out of it. Matsuo, still determined to open his Disney-themed park, opened Nara Dreamland in 1961, a near replica of Disneyland except without Disney&#x27;s characters or intellectual property. This park would continue to operate until 2006, and was eventually demolished in 2017.

In February 1974, the Oriental Land Company (OLC) formally invited Disney executives to Japan for a fact-finding tour. In June of the same year, the company&#x27;s president, Chiharu Kawasaki, visited Disney&#x27;s headquarters to reinforce the OLC&#x27;s desire to bring Disneyland to Japan. Kawasaki once again extended an invitation to the top Disney executives to visit Japan; the offer was taken up in December.

After many years of negotiations Masatomo Takahashi, president of the OLC, signed the initial contract for the construction of Tokyo Disneyland in Chiba Prefecture in April 1979. Japanese engineers and architects visited California to tour Disneyland and prepare to construct the new park. The construction of the park began a year later and was covered by hundreds of reporters as an indication of the high expectations for the park in the future. The final cost of Tokyo Disneyland was 180 billion yen rather than the projected 100 billion yen.

On February 28, 2020, the OLC announced a temporary closure of Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea from February 29 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The closure, originally slated to expire in mid-March, was later extended twice, with the latest extension being until July 1, 2020.

== Park layout and attractions ==
With a few exceptions, Tokyo Disneyland features the same attractions found in Disneyland and Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom.

===World Bazaar===

World Bazaar is the main entry corridor and primary shopping area of Tokyo Disneyland. Despite the use of the word &quot;World&quot; in its name, the general look and theme of World Bazaar is that of early 20th-century America, matching the &quot;Main Street, U.S.A.&quot; areas of other Magic Kingdom-style parks. World Bazaar consists of two intersecting &quot;streets&quot;: Main Street (the primary corridor running from the main entrance toward Cinderella Castle), and Center Street, which forms a perpendicular line with Main Street and leads to Adventureland in one direction and Tomorrowland in the other. World Bazaar has a permanent canopy covering the Main Street and Center Street areas, designed to protect guests from the elements.

===Adventureland===
Adventureland consists of two distinct yet complementary areas: A New Orleans-themed area and a &quot;jungle&quot;-themed area. It borrows stylistic and architectural features from the New Orleans Square and Adventureland areas found in Disneyland Park in the United States.

===Westernland===

Westernland is an &quot;old west&quot; themed area, the counterpart of Frontierland in other Magic Kingdom-style parks. The landscape of Westernland is dominated by Big Thunder Mountain, a Monument Valley-style mountain surrounding a mine train roller coaster, and the Rivers of America, a man-made waterway that is home to the Mark Twain Riverboat, Tom Sawyer Island, and numerous live and Audio-Animatronic animals.

===Critter Country===

Critter Country is a small area of the park with the key attraction being Splash Mountain, a log-flume ride which opened in 1992 and is based on the animated sequences of Disney&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;Song of the South.&quot;

===Fantasyland===
Like other Magic Kingdom theme parks, Fantasyland&#x27;s central entryway is a castle, in this case Cinderella Castle, a near exact copy of the one in Florida&#x27;s Magic Kingdom. Lacking any &quot;thrill rides&quot;, Fantasyland&#x27;s attractions are generally dark rides that take visitors through scenes from Disney films such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

A new &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; sub-section opened in September 2020 as part of the theme park&#x27;s largest expansion. A dark ride named Enchanted Tale of Beauty and the Beast is housed in the new Beauty and the Beast Castle with Maurice&#x27;s Cottage and Gaston&#x27;s Fountain at its entrance. The new section also houses Belle&#x27;s Village which includes the La Taverne de Gaston eatery, and Village Shoppes selling souvenirs and gifts.

A new stage show venue named Fantasyland Forest Theatre is also part of the expansion. With a capacity of 1,500 people, the venue will introduce a 25-minute Mickey&#x27;s Magical Music World show.

===Toontown===
Like its counterpart at Disneyland, Toontown (called &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Toontown&quot; at Disneyland) is heavily inspired by the movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. The major attraction here is Roger Rabbit&#x27;s Car Toon Spin.

A new attraction named Minnie&#x27;s Style Studio opened in September 2020 as part of the theme park&#x27;s largest expansion. As a character greeting area, it allows guests to take photos with Minnie who will be wearing a rotating selection of seasonal outfits.

===Tomorrowland===

As is the case with other modern-day Disney theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s Tomorrowland forgoes a realism-based vision of the future and instead features science-fiction fantasy themes. Architecturally it borrows much from the 1971–1993 version of Florida&#x27;s Tomorrowland. Rides include Space Mountain, and Star Tours – The Adventures Continue.

A rotating car ride named The Happy Ride with Baymax opened in September 2020 as part of the theme park&#x27;s largest expansion. The ride is the first Disney attraction to be themed based on Disney&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;. A new specialty space-themed popcorn shop named The Big Pop also opened on the same day.
==Upcoming Attractions ==
The park will receive an attraction themed to Disney Animation&#x27;s Wreck-It Ralph, as well as the third renovation of Space Mountain in the section of Tomorrowland, with construction started in 2024.

==Attendance==
==Future==
Since the park opened in 1983, Tokyo Disney Resort has regularly been one of the most profitable Disney resorts. By 1994, over 149 million people had entered through the gates of Tokyo Disneyland, more than Japan&#x27;s entire population of 127.6 million at the time. In 1996, it employed 12,390 people, making Tokyo Disneyland the biggest workplace in Japan&#x27;s diversionary outings at that time. Many speculate that Tokyo Disneyland is such an economic success due to timing and location; the theme park lies in a metropolitan area with a population of 30 million and opened at the height of a booming economy where hard-working citizens desired an escape from reality.

Tokyo Disneyland states that one of its main aims is to improve the park and diversify from the limits of the domestic Disney parks. Tokyo Disneyland has recently been adding a national identity within the parks by adding attractions with distinctly Japanese qualities. Cinderella Castle displays the Disney character and story plot yet presents the story through the eyes of the Japanese. Once dominated by Disney Legends, Masatomo Takahashi, the former president of The Oriental Land Company, states this growth and development as one of its primary goals: &quot;We must not just repeat what we receive from Disney. I am convinced that we must contribute to the cultural exchange between Japan and U.S.A.&quot;

<text>Golden Crisp, also known as Sugar Crisp in Canada, is a brand of breakfast cereal made by Post Consumer Brands that consists of sweetened, candy-coated puffed wheat and is noted for its high sugar content. It was introduced in the United States in 1948.

== History ==
At the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to Cracker Jack&#x27;s candy-coated popcorn. The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as &quot;Ranger Joe&quot;, the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated breakfast cereal. Post Foods introduced their own version in 1948. The Post version was originally called &quot;Happy Jax&quot;, and was renamed to &quot;Sugar Crisp&quot; the next year. 

Sugar Crisp debuted with what &quot;The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets&quot; would later call &quot;an astonishing sugar content of 51 percent&quot; (in weight), which remained the second highest in the US market when competitor Kellogg&#x27;s introduced its Sugar Smacks (later renamed Honey Smacks) in the early 1950s which consisted of 55% sugar. The two cereals are both sweetened puffed wheat.

In 1967, the name was changed to &quot;Super Sugar Crisp&quot;, and in 1985, it was changed again to &quot;Super Golden Crisp&quot;. Finally, it was changed to &quot;Golden Crisp&quot; (during a time when many cereals dropped the word &quot;Sugar&quot; from their names) in the American market.

In the early 1970s, there was a short-lived variation on the original Sugar Crisp, called &quot;Super Orange Crisp&quot;, which had orange-flavored O&#x27;s in it.

As of 2021, the product is still sold as Sugar Crisp in Canada, with ads displaying the Sugar Bear mascot and the phrase &quot;Can&#x27;t get enough of that Sugar Crisp.&quot;

==Marketing==

Advertisements in the 1950s positioned this sugar cereal as being appropriate to eat for breakfast, as a snack, or as candy, similar to candy-coated popcorn products like Cracker Jack. Early advertisements featured three animated cartoon bears named Dandy, Handy, and Candy as the mascots. The early slogan said, &quot;As a cereal it&#x27;s dandy—for snacks it&#x27;s so handy—or eat it like candy!&quot;

Later television advertisements feature one mascot, an anthropomorphic cartoon bear character known as Sugar Bear, who sings the jingle, &quot;Can&#x27;t get enough of that Sugar Crisp&quot;, to the tune of Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho. In commercials, Sugar Bear could turn into &quot;Super Bear&quot; upon eating it. This was dropped in the mid-to-late 1980s, where he would simply defeat his foes with a &quot;vitamin-packed punch&quot; as Sugar Bear. The jingle was also expanded to conclude with &quot;it&#x27;s got the crunch with punch&quot;, although this was dropped in later years. In later lines of commercials (the first listed produced exclusively for Canada), Sugar Bear would do battle with Stan, a security guard at the Sugar Crisp factory (from whom Sugar Bear would try to steal mass amounts of Sugar Crisp straight from the factory, often swimming in the honey used to sweeten it with the phrase &quot;how sweet it is!&quot;), or (one of the earliest and longest running of his co-stars) Granny, an elderly witch-like figure with a magic wand (voiced by Ruth Buzzi and later by June Foray) who, despite liberal use of magic, could never keep Sugar Bear from helping himself to her Golden Crisp. Sugar Bear&#x27;s voice, provided by Gerry Matthews for forty years, was in the style of a suave crooner like Bing Crosby or Dean Martin.

The focus of advertising shifted from targeting children to including parents, by downplaying the sweet taste (and associated sugar content).

== Concerns over sugar content ==
In 1975, Super Orange Crisp was found to contain almost 71 percent sugar by dentist Ira Shannon. Shannon, who became tired of seeing so many cavities in his patients&#x27; mouths, bought hundreds of different kinds of sugary breakfast cereals and analyzed the contents of each in a lab.

In a 2008 comparison of the nutritional value of 27 cereals, U.S. magazine &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; found that Post&#x27;s Golden Crisp and the similar Kellogg&#x27;s Honey Smacks were the two brands with the highest sugar content—more than 50 percent (by weight)—commenting that one serving of this or other high-sugar cereals contained at least as much sugar &quot;as there is in a glazed doughnut from Dunkin&#x27; Donuts&quot;. Consumer Reports recommended that parents choose cereal brands with better nutritional ratings for their children.

<doc id="1088531" wikidata="Q495410" url="?curid=1088531" title="Winter Sonata">
<text>Winter Sonata () is a 2002 South Korean television drama series, starring Bae Yong-joon and Choi Ji-woo. It is the second part of the season-themed tetralogy &quot;Endless Love&quot; drama series directed by Yoon Seok-ho. Filming primarily took place on the resort island of Namiseom and Seoul. It aired on KBS2 from January 14 to March 19, 2002, on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 (KST) for 20 episodes. It has also been adapted into an anime series and a stage musical.

==Synopsis==
The story begins when Joon-sang (Bae Yong-joon), the son of an eminent musician, moves to Chuncheon, a rural city in South Korea. As an extraordinarily talented student, Joon-sang is welcomed by his fellow students as well as his teachers, but remains a quiet, introverted teenager. As a result of the belief that his biological father is dead, and serious disagreements with his mother, Joon-sang believes that no one truly loves him.

On his way to school one day, Joon-sang&#x27;s classmate Yoo-jin (Choi Ji-woo), while sitting next to him on the bus, falls asleep on his shoulder. After a few weeks, the two forge a close friendship. One day, Joon-sang convinces Yoo-jin to escape school together. On the way, Joon-sang soon falls in love with Yoo-jin, who opens her innocent heart to him.
One fateful day, when Joon-sang pays a visit to Yoo-jin&#x27;s house, he comes across a photo in their photo album. Their love, however, is cut short after Joon-sang is badly injured in a car accident and, due to brain damage, sustains amnesia, unable to remember anything prior to his accident.

Joon-sang&#x27;s mother, yearning for Joon-sang&#x27;s love and respect, has Joon-sang brainwashed by a hypnotist hoping to erase Joon-sang&#x27;s memories of his painful childhood as an illegitimate child. As a result, Joon-sang&#x27;s memories prior to the accident are erased. Joon-sang&#x27;s mother decides to move to the United States with Joon-sang, where he can start a new life under the identity of Lee Min-hyung. His friends and teachers are told that Joon-sang is dead.

Ten years later, Min-hyung is an award-winning architect in the United States. He does not remember anything about his life in Korea. He is completely different, now an open-minded person who cares about other people. He returns to Korea and Yoo-jin sees him on the street, prompting her to put off her engagement to her childhood friend Sang-hyuk (Park Yong-ha). Little does she know that Min-hyung is dating her friend and past rival Chae-rin (Park Sol-mi). The story&#x27;s plot thickens when Yoo-jin&#x27;s interior design firm is awarded a project by Min-hyung&#x27;s architectural firm, and has to work with Min-hyung. Yoo-jin sometimes wonders if he is her supposedly dead first love Joon-sang.

After a few months, Min-hyung also falls in love with Yoo-jin, fueling the anger of Chae-rin. Chae-rin sees Yoo-jin as a third wheel and attempts to draw 
Min-hyung&#x27;s attention back to herself by lying about Yoo-jin. However, her plan is exposed when Min-hyung accidentally overhears a conversation between Chae-rin and Jin-sook.

==Reception==
&quot;Winter Sonata&quot; is credited with causing the second wave of the Korean Wave and extending it to Japan and the Philippines. It improved the image of South Korea among the Japanese and set fashion trends throughout East Asia. The series was a commercial success; 330,000 DVDs and 1,200,000 copies of &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; novelizations were sold. The series yielded more than when taking into account the profit it contributed to tourism. The number of visitors to the island of Namiseom (where the series was shot) grew from 250,000 to over 650,000 after the series was aired. A statue of the main characters can also be found on the island at the spot where they first kissed.

The series shot actor Bae Yong-joon into stardom in Asia, and he became especially popular among middle-aged Japanese women. When he first visited Japan in 2004, more than 3,000 women guarded by 350 policemen gathered at the airport to welcome him. Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister at the time, was quoted saying that Bae was more popular in Japan than himself.

The series was also aired in the Philippines in 2003, via GMA Network&#x27;s primetime block under the title &quot;Endless Love II: Winter Sonata&quot; and one of the highest rated shows at that time. As a result, it also brought the Korean Wave to the Philippines. Just like in Japan, Bae Yong-joon became popular among middle-aged women.

The series was a success in Asia and the America as well.

==Original soundtrack==

In addition, &quot;Moment&quot; performed by Ryu and available on his album &quot;Ryu 2&quot; is included on some bootleg versions of the &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; soundtrack.

==International broadcast==
The drama first aired in Japan on NHK in 2004; it was dubbed in Japanese and edited into 60-minute episodes. The final episode (which aired on August 23, 2004) recorded ratings of 20.6% in Kanto, 22.5% in Nagoya, and 23.8% in the Kansai regions. The series as a whole had an average viewership in the 14% to 15% range. Due to overwhelming demand from viewers to watch the series in its original format, it was re-aired on NHK&#x27;s satellite channel BS2 unedited (in its original Korean audio, with Japanese subtitles), beginning December 20, 2004.

It was the first Korean drama that ushered in the Korean Wave in Malaysia, when it aired in 2002 on TV3 dubbed in Mandarin with Malay subtitles. PMP Entertainment later released the drama in VCD and DVD format under the Bahasa title, &quot;Kisah Cinta Musim Salju&quot; (meaning &quot;Winter Love Story&quot;). A Malay cover version of the theme song was released with the title &quot;Sonata Musim Salju&quot; (meaning &quot;Winter&#x27;s Sonata&quot;).

The drama aired in Nepal on Kantipur Television Network in the mid-2000s dubbed in Nepali. The drama triggered the Korean Wave in the country and its lead star Bae Yong-joon became very popular amongst women in the country.

In Indonesia, Winter Sonata was broadcast on SCTV in August 2002.

In 2006, pan-Asian American network AZN Television bought the rights to air &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; in a 24-hour marathon with other Korean dramas.

In Asia, the drama is available to stream via Iflix with English, Indonesian, Malay, Simplified Mandarin, Sinhalese, Vietnamese and Burmese subtitles.

==Anime==
An anime adaptation of &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; premiered on Japan&#x27;s SKY PerfecTV! on October 17, 2009, consisting of 26 episodes subtitled in Japanese and English. Directed by Ahn Jae-hoon and written by Kim Hyeong-wan, the program featured 23 members of the original Korean cast voicing the characters, including Bae and Choi who reprised their roles. The role of &quot;Sang-hyuk&quot;, originally played by Park Yong-ha, was voiced by singer Kang Yo-hwan and &quot;Chae-rin&quot; was dubbed by newcomer Lee Se-na in place of Park Sol-mi. During October 2011, Animax Asia aired the anime in Korean audio and English subtitles across South and Southeast Asia.

Two pachinko simulation games called &quot;Pachitte Chonmage Tatsujin 10: Pachinko Fuyu no Sonata&quot; and &quot;Pachitte Chonmage Tatsujin 15: Pachinko Fuyu no Sonata 2&quot; were made by Hack Berry and released on January 25, 2007 and December 25, 2008, respectively and for the PlayStation 2.

A Nintendo DSi enhanced title, called &quot;Fuyu no Sonata DS&quot; was released in Japan by D3Publisher on December 17, 2009.

==In popular culture==
In episode 5 of &quot;Da Capo II&quot;&#x27;s first season (aired October 29, 2007), two main characters go to a movie called &quot;Fuyu no Anata&quot; (冬のアナタ), which is clearly &quot;Fuyu no Sonata&quot; (both share the same font and characters). One of the &quot;Fuyu no Anata&quot; posters visible in the &quot;Da Capo&quot; anime episode looks exactly like the first &quot;Fuyu no Sonata&quot; manga cover. The Japanese anime &quot;Kaguya-sama: Love Is War&quot; has a soundtrack adapted from one of the soundtracks by the Korean drama.

In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode Candy, Quahog Marshmallow, Peter, Cleveland and Joe become obsessed with a Korean drama called &quot;Winter Summer&quot;, a parody of &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;.

<doc id="1088534" wikidata="Q1153908" url="?curid=1088534" title="Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama">
<text>is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward had an estimated population of 209,565 and a density of 6,760 persons per km². The total area was . The ward symbol, established 1987, expresses the image of sea, waves, and a sea gull.

==History==
The area around present-day Kanazawa Ward has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the Jōmon period at numerous locations in the area. Under the Nara period Ritsuryō system, it became part of Kuraki District in Musashi Province. By the Kamakura period it was part of a &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by the Hōjō clan, who established a major seaport for the Kamakura shogunate at Mutsuura, and a noted library and educational center at Kanazawa Bunko.

During the Edo period, much of the area was part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; territory in Musashi Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. In 1726, a large portion of the present ward came under the control of the newly established Mutsuura Domain ruled by the Yonekura clan. The area consisted of small farming and fishing villages. During the Bakumatsu period, the area offshore Kanazawa was an anchorage for the American black ships under command of Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and 1854. After the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858, it was one of the first areas in Japan opened to foreign trade. In 1871, with the abolition of the han system following the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of Kuraki District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1887, Itō Hirobumi and a group of political scholars completed the final drafts of the Meiji Constitution while secluded in an inn in Kanazawa. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. The area was connected by rail to Yokohama with the opening of the Shōnan Electric Railway (the predecessor of the modern Keihin Electric Express Railway in 1930. In October 1936, Kuraki District was abolished, and the area was absorbed into Yokohama City, becoming part of Isogo Ward. A large railway carriage factory was established in Kanazawa Ward in 1946 by the Tokyu Corporation on the site of a former Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Center. Kanazawa Ward gained its independence from Isogo Ward in May 1948.

<text>Stormont County area is a county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

Stormont was created in 1792, but was settled seven years earlier in 1785. Veterans of Loyalist regiments were among the first settlers. An estimated one third of the pioneers in the county were Highlander, one third German and the rest English, Irish and Lowland Scots people.

The original territory of Stormont also included Russell County, which became a separate county in 1800.

Stormont later united with Dundas and Glengarry to form the regional government United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.

==Historic Townships==
*Cornwall (SE): area . Was settled in 1785 by veterans of Sir John Johnson&#x27;s and other Loyalist companies. Community centres were Moulinette, north Field and Cornwall. This township is now part of South Stormont Township
*Finch (NW): Was part of Osnabruck Township until 1798. It was settled in 1785. It is named in honour of Lady Elizabeth Finch, wife of the first Earl of Mansfield. Community centres were Crysler, Berwick, Finch, and Glen Payne. The township is now part of North Stormont Township
*Osnabruck (SW): area . Surveyed from 1784 to 1787, it was named from a Hanoverian town closely associated with the royal family. The township was settled in 1785 by Loyalist veterans, many of them Germans. Community Centres: Newington, Grantley, Osnabruck Centre and Wales. The township is now part of South Stormont Township.
*Roxborough (NE): Was part of Cornwall Township until 1798. It was named from the Scottish County. Community Centres were Moose Creek, Avonmore and Monckland. The township is now part of North Stormont Township.

<text>Glengarry County, an area covering , is a county in the province of Ontario, Canada. It is still inhabited by the descendants of 18th and early 19th-century Scottish Highland pioneer settlers from Lochaber, was historically a Gàidhealtachd community, and Canadian Gaelic language revival efforts are currently taking place there. Glengarry County consists of the townships of North Glengarry and South Glengarry. It borders the Saint Lawrence River to the south, the county of Stormont and City of Cornwall to the west, the province of Quebec to the east, and the United Counties of Prescott-Russell to the north.

==History==
Glengarry was founded in 1784 by Gaelic-speaking United Empire Loyalists, mainly from Clan Donald, whose defeat in the American Revolution had caused them to become refugees from the Mohawk Valley in upstate New York, North Carolina, and, despite the fact that most Scottish Gaels in that Colony chose to be Patriots, from Georgia. His Majesty&#x27;s Government, as represented by the Governor General of British North America, Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, hoped the new migrants would help settle and develop the area, which first became known as Upper Canada and later as Ontario. The Crown accordingly issued land grants and helped with supplies during the first winter, in lieu of financial compensation for their confiscated properties in United States.

Other veterans of the British armed forces during later wars received land instead of pay for their salaries, particularly the Glengarry Fencibles, a Scottish regiment organized by Roman Catholic military chaplain Alexander Macdonnell, who followed the regiment&#x27;s soldiers and their families to the county and later became the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Kingston. The county was named after Clan MacDonald of Glengarry, where Bishop MacDonell and many of the soldiers of the regiment had also come from. 
The Presbyterian Gaels of the settlement, on the other hand, were looked after in early years, by Loyalist refugee Rev. John Bethune, formerly the minister of the Gaelic-speaking Barbeque Presbyterian Church in Harnett County, North Carolina. Even so, the unlikely friendship between the Presbyterian minister and the Catholic Bishop remains legendary today.

Following an 1814 visit to the settlement, Dr. D. MacPherson wrote, &quot;You might travel over the whole of the County and by far the greater part of Stormont, without hearing anything spoken except the good Gaelic. Every family, even of the lowest order, has a landed property of 200 acres... However poor the family (but indeed there are none that can be called so) they kill a bullock for the winter consumption; the farm or estate supplies them with abundance of butter, cheese, etc., etc. Their houses are small but comfortable, having a ground floor and garret, with regular chimney and glass windows. The appearance of the people is at all times respectable, but I was delighted at seeing them at church on a Sunday; the men clothed in good English cloth, and many of the women wore the Highland plaid.&quot;

Understandingly, this prosperity in contrast with the escalation of widespread poverty in the Highlands and Islands caused by rackrenting landlords, the Highland Clearances, and the Highland Potato Famine, meant that Glengarry County long remained a magnet for new immigration from the Gàidhealtachd. The distinctive Canadian Gaelic dialect once spoken pervasively throughout the County has also contributed much to both Scottish Gaelic literature and Scottish traditional music. For example, poet Anna NicGillìosa (1759-1847) emigrated from Morar to Upper Canada in 1786 and eventually settled in South Glengarry, and a Gaelic song-poem in praise of her new home there survives. Following her death there in 1847, NicGillìosa was buried beside the (now ruined) St Raphael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.
One visitor during early settlement later recalled, &quot;Anyone who ever saw the reaping bees by moonlight was likely never to forget it; a singer would come, sickle in hand, follow the bent form of the racing reapers (women and men) leading the solo part of a song which they, or their forbears, had learned in the Highlands, while the workers kept up time with great glee and good time... Although the young men did not handle the needle at quilting bees, they generally put in an appearance in the evening when the girls had accomplished that feat, but at fulling bees both sexes participated and the fulling could not be properly carried on without the songs to regulate the time for the beating of the cloth with hands and feet.&quot;

Over time, however, railway expansion into the region, economic downturns, and the Anglicisation policy in the Canadian school system took their toll. It also did not help that, similarly to Gaelic-speaking politicians in other parts of Canada, political leaders from Glengarry tended to side with pro-English language policies and routinely chose to deliberately antagonise French Canadian language activists, rather than joining forces to fight for their mutual linguistic rights. Furthermore, soldiers from Glengarry County were deployed against the Upper Canada rebellion of 1837 and the Patriot War of 1838, which resulted in a letter of thanks from the Governor General.

In 1879, a visitor from Scotland enthusiastically declared that the Glengarry dialect of Scottish Gaelic was better preserved, &quot;with the most perfect accent, and with scarcely any, if any, admixture of English&quot;, in Glengarry County and in Cornwall, Ontario than in Lochaber itself.

In 1884, however, one Glengarry writer lamented, &quot;During the lifetime of the first immigrants the Gaelic language was much in use, so much so that knowledge of it was considered a necessary qualification for the Presbyterian pulpit. The common school, however, has brought the new generation to use the English tongue, and a Gaelic sermon is seldom heard, though in some isolated areas is in some measure of use.&quot;

By the same decade, Glengarry County had also become a major center for outward migration, especially to the United States, &quot;In proportion to size of territory and population, the district has sent more lumbermen to Michigan forests, more settlers to Minnesota prairies, more hands to assist and direct the construction of railways, than any other on the American continent... effective reference may be made to the settlement in Dakota, where a new Glengarry is springing up.&quot;

The Glengarry Highland Games were first celebrated in 1948. They have been held annually since, during the weekend before the first Monday in August. These Games are one of the largest of their kind outside Scotland, attracting visitors from all over the world. The original territory of Glengarry also included Prescott County, which became a separate county in 1800.

Glengarry united with Stormont and Dundas in 1850 to form the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.

Canadian Gaelic (i.e. Canadian Scottish Gaelic) used to be the main community language spoken throughout the region. Though the number of speakers has steadily decreased over time and the last &quot;fluent&quot; speaker of the Glengarry County Gaelic dialect died in 2001, those working towards a local Gaelic language revival have formed classes for heritage language learning throughout Glengarry.

==Historic townships==

Glengarry was originally divided east and west into Charlottenburgh and Lancaster townships, and then eventually divided into four townships. It has since been divided into North and South Glengarry.
* Charlottenburgh – now in South Glengarry Township, it was named in honour of Queen Charlotte.
* Kenyon – now in North Glengarry Township. Kenyon Township was taken from Charlottenburg Township in 1798, and was named from the English Chief Justice Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon
* Lancaster – now in South Glengarry Township. Surveyed in 1784, it was first settled in 1785.
* Lochiel – now in North Glengarry. Lochiel Township separated from Lancaster Township on November 24, 1818. Lochiel was named after the chief of the Clan Cameron. This clan had many representatives among the veteran settlers.

<doc id="1088538" wikidata="Q4388776" url="?curid=1088538" title="Kinuta Park">
<text>is a park in Setagaya, Tokyo. The total area is , about two-thirds of which () is grass.

Kinuta Park is famous for its cherry blossom (&quot;sakura&quot;) viewing. It has at least three varieties—Someiyoshino (photo), Yamazakura, and Yaezakura—and this makes for a relatively long hanami viewing season of over two weeks.

==Facilities==
There are baseball fields, soccer fields, cycling courses and the Setagaya Art Museum. The 1.66 km cycling course doubles as a walking course outside the hours of 9 am and 4 pm.

==History==
The park was a wooded area. It was planned as a park in 1935 ahead of the 2,600th anniversary of the legendary founding of Japan by Emperor Jimmu, the mythical first emperor of Japan. After Japan was awarded the 1940 Summer Olympics in 1936 it was planned that the Olympic village would have built either here in the Todoroki Gorge area. After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 the Olympics were forfeited to Helsinki in Finland, (the runner-up in the bidding process) but were later cancelled entirely due to World War II.

In 1957 the area became a public golf course, which was later closed and turned into the park in its current form. The park still resembles a golf course when seen from above.

==Access==
The Tōmei Expressway (東名高速道路, Tōmei Kōsoku Dōro) runs along the south side; Kampachi (環八, the #8 ring road), along the east. The Tōmei Expressway ends at that intersection.

<doc id="1088540" wikidata="Q4874056" url="?curid=1088540" title="Horsmonden">
<text>Horsmonden ( ) is a village in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. The village is located in the Weald of Kent. It is situated on a road leading from Maidstone to Lamberhurst, three miles north of the latter place. The nearest railway station is Paddock Wood.

== History ==
The village&#x27;s name is derived from the Anglo Saxon &quot;hors&quot; meaning &#x27;horse&#x27;, &quot;bune&quot; (&#x27;reed&#x27;) or &quot;burna&quot; (&#x27;stream&#x27;) and &quot;denn&quot;, a Kentish word meaning &#x27;wooded pasture&#x27;. The village is first recorded as Horsbundenne around the turn of the twelfth century.

The village was an important centre of the post-medieval iron industry and the nearby Furnace Pond is one of the largest of the artificial lakes made to provide water power for the works. King Charles I visited the foundry in 1638 to watch a cannon being cast – a bronze four-pounder, forty-two inches long, now preserved in London&#x27;s White Tower.

The village was home to Jane Austen&#x27;s grandfather who lived at Broadford, a 15th-century clothmaster&#x27;s hall, and several other of her relatives. The main Austen residence moved from Broadford to Capel Manor House which was constructed in 1860 but demolished in 1966. Many of the family&#x27;s graves can be seen in the churchyard of St. Margaret&#x27;s Church.

There is a Pavee horse fair held on the village green each year. In 2000, the local parish council with assistance of the then-Home Secretary Jack Straw, ruled that due to ongoing safety concerns, the fair would not go ahead and a 5-mile exclusion zone was put in place. However, due to protests and legal action from the wider Pavee community, this decision was overturned and the fairs resumed following a compromise between the travellers and the local authorities in 2001.

St Margaret&#x27;s Church is located some distance away from the centre of the village, towards the neighbouring village of Goudhurst.

Just outside the village is the 16th-century National Trust property Sprivers, which has an open garden at specific dates as part of the National Gardens Scheme.

==Public transport==

When the branch railway line to Hawkhurst was operating, there was a railway station for the village. However Horsmonden railway station closed in 1961. The station site is now used as a garage called &quot;Old Station Garage&quot; and the stationmaster&#x27;s house is now a private residence.

Today the only public transport for Horsmonden is the 297 bus route previously operated by Renown, but now operated by Hams Travel and a 296 which goes to Tunbridge Wells from Paddock Wood operated by Arriva.

There are also two school bus services (the 268 and the 267) operated by Hams Travel.

==Cricket club==
Horsmonden Cricket Club dates back to 1738. The team is first recorded in July 1738, playing against Chislehurst Cricket Club on Chislehurst Common. A return match took place at an unspecified venue in Horsmonden on Friday, 21 July 1738. The club retained prominence into the 1740s.

The club today is home to six cricket teams: two men&#x27;s sides and four youth sides.

==Notable people==

*John Browne (d 1651), gunfounder, leased Brenchley Furnace, the site of which is now in Horsmonden.
*Simon Willard, (d 1676), who founded the town of Concord, Massachusetts in Massachusetts Bay, was born in Horsmonden
*William Moon (1818–94), teacher and philanthropist, was born in Horsmonden
*Ruth Thomas (b 1967), novelist, was born in Horsmonden

<text>Bothwell was a federal electoral district in the Canadian province of Ontario, which was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1904. It is sometimes also considered one of Ontario&#x27;s historic counties, as it was listed in some post-Confederation census records as a county of residence.

==District==
At its creation in 1867, Bothwell consisted of the Kent County townships of Bothwell, Camden, Dresden, Howard, Orford, Ridgetown, Thamesville and Zone, and the Lambton County townships of Dawn, Euphemia and Sombra. In 1882, the Townships of Euphemia, Orford and Howard were excluded from the riding, and the township of Chatham, the villages of Wallaceburg, Dresden and Thamesville, and the town of Bothwell were added to the riding.

The electoral district was abolished in 1903 when it was redistributed between Kent East, Kent West, Simcoe East and Simcoe South ridings.
==Members of Parliament==
This riding elected the following members of the House of Commons of Canada:





==Election results==

<doc id="1088548" wikidata="Q3751896" url="?curid=1088548" title="ETA political-military">
<text>ETA political-military (, ) or ETA (pm) was the majority faction of the Basque revolutionary armed organization ETA who, during Spain&#x27;s transition to democracy, opted for a double legged structure, political on the one side and military on the other, while or ETA(m) adopted a military-only structure with its constituent divisions detaching into new self-standing organizations (LAB in 1974, etc.). 

In the late 1970s, ETA(pm) divided into two groups, with the bulk of the militants siding with the so-called &quot;Berezis&quot; (the Special Cells). The Berezis merged shortly after with ETA(m), following that the resulting organization became the main branch of ETA and was called from then on ETA(m). Those who stuck to the positions of ETA(pm)&#x27;s executive board defended the submission of ETA&#x27;s violent actions to their political party EIA&#x27;s needs (founding party of Euskadiko Ezkerra), often economical urges. However, Spanish officials hard pressed on the newly formed party to immediately stop ETA(pm)&#x27;s actions or to face up to the consequences. 

In the early 1980s, the VII Assembly was held, which sought a way out of armed struggle. ETA(pm) - VII Assembly, through the mediation of its political alter ego, the party Euskadiko Ezkerra (&quot;Basque Country&#x27;s Left&quot;), accepted a policy of individual pardons to all members who publicly renounced violence. Many of its former members integrated into Euskadiko Ezkerra, which later fused with the Socialist Party of the Basque Country–Basque Country Left (PSE), the Basque affiliate of the national Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. 

Still a small group in ETA (pm) refused to join the VII Assembly and kept the armed activity under the name ETA - VIII Assembly, soon to merge with ETA(m) in 1983.

<text>Charles Joseph Hiller (October 1, 1934 – October 20, 2004) was an American Major League Baseball second baseman. In the 1962 World Series, he became the first National League player to hit a grand slam in a World Series.

Hiller batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as tall and . After his playing days ended, he spent the rest of his life in baseball as a coach and manager.

==University of St. Thomas==
After graduating from McHenry East High School in Johnsburg, Illinois, Hiller attended the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. As a junior in , Hiller batted .576. In , he batted cleanup for the Tommies&#x27; Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championship team. Hiller was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame in .

==Minor leagues==
He was signed by the Cleveland Indians in . Over two seasons in Cleveland&#x27;s farm system, he batted .288 with nineteen home runs. On December 2, he was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the minor league baseball draft.

In , Hiller was the Texas League Player of the Year, when he batted .334 with three home runs and 74 runs batted in for the Rio Grande Valley Giants. Over two seasons, he batted .337 with 151 RBIs.

==San Francisco Giants==
===Rookie season===
Hiller was awarded the starting second base job to start the season. He went 1-for-4 in his major league debut on opening day, but the 0-for-21 stretch that followed his first major league hit got him in more of a platoon with the righty hitting Joey Amalfitano.

He managed to get his batting average up to .143 by the first time he went into Los Angeles to face the Dodgers on April 25 and 26. Hiller feasted on Dodgers pitching. He led off game one of the two game set with a double, and came around to score the first run of the game on Willie McCovey&#x27;s single. In the second game, with the Giants trailing 3–2, he led off the eighth inning with a double, and came around to score the tying run on Willie Mays&#x27; single. Overall, Hiller went 4-for-10 with three doubles and three runs scored in the Giants&#x27; two-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

His hitting steadily improved from there. On April 30, he went 3-for-6 with two doubles and two runs scored in a 14–4 walloping of the Milwaukee Braves. On May 30, he hit his first major league home run off the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Jim Brosnan. For the month of June, he batted .292 to bring his average to .233.

He was hampered, however, by poor fielding. Playing the Philadelphia Phillies on June 5, Hiller mishandled Harvey Kuenn&#x27;s throw from third on what should have been a routine double play. The next batter, Pancho Herrera, followed with a lead-changing three-run home run. On June 11, his second inning error on a Smoky Burgess ground ball opened the door for the Pittsburgh Pirates to score four runs. It was his seventh error of the season, and played into the decision to demote Hiller to the triple A Tacoma Giants in early July.

Hiller tore up the Pacific Coast League to the tune of a .324 batting average, five home runs and 32 RBIs to get a call back up to the majors in September. He went 3-for-5 with a run scored in his first game back in the majors, and batted .289 over the rest of the season. He also committed just one inconsequential error for a .980 fielding percentage. His rookie year, Hiller batted .238 with two home runs, twelve RBIs and 38 runs scored. He committed eight errors for a .973 fielding percentage.

===Starting second baseman===
Amalfitano&#x27;s selection by the Houston Colt .45s in the 1962 Major League Baseball expansion draft led Giants brass to openly attempt to acquire a new second baseman before the season began. Unsuccessful, Hiller became the 1962 Giants&#x27; de facto full-time second baseman despite a poor Spring training.

Usually batting second or lead off, Hiller understood his role. He had a career high 166 hits that led to a career high 94 runs scored in front of the power bats of Mays, McCovey, Felipe Alou and Orlando Cepeda. He would also set career highs in games played (161), doubles (22) and RBIs (48). On a negative note, he also paced major league second basemen with 29 errors.

The Giants and Dodgers were embroiled in a season long battle for first place in the NL. The Dodgers were two games up on the Giants, and needed just one win when they went into St. Louis for a three-game set against the St. Louis Cardinals to end the season. The Dodgers were swept, resulting in the teams ending their 162-game schedules with identical 101-61 records, and setting up a three game tie-breaker series. The Giants won the series to face the New York Yankees in the World Series. Hiller went 3-for-10 with an RBI and a run scored.

===1962 World Series===
The Giants lost game one of the World Series at home (Hiller went 1-for-4 with a run scored). They scored early in game two, when Hiller led off the Giants&#x27; half of the first inning with a double, and scored on Matty Alou&#x27;s ground out. It would turn out to be all the run support Jack Sanford needed, as he held the Yankees to three hits in a complete game shutout.

After losing game three at Yankee Stadium, the Giants had a 2–0 lead in game four thanks to catcher Tom Haller&#x27;s two-run home run. The Yankees, however, came back with two in the sixth to tie the score. Jim Davenport walked to lead off the seventh, and the Giants put runners on second and third when Matty Alou doubled. Yankees pitcher Marshall Bridges entered the game, and intentionally walked his first batter, Bob Nieman to load the bases for Harvey Kuenn. Kuenn popped out to third, bringing Hiller to the plate with two outs.

Hiller struck out in his previous at bat with two outs and the bases loaded. This time, he came through. He drove Bridges&#x27; fastball into the front row in the right field stands for the first grand slam in World Series play by a National Leaguer. He drove in an additional run in the ninth (unearned run, no RBI credited) in the Giants&#x27; 7–3 victory.

Hiller also drove in the first run of game five, ultimately won by the Yankees, 5–3. In game six, he scored the Giants&#x27; fifth and final run. Hiller was held hitless, and struck out in the ninth in Ralph Terry&#x27;s game seven four hit gem that brought the Yankees their 20th World Series title.

In his only World Series, Hiller batted .269 (7-for-26) and turned seven double plays during the seven game series. He led the Giants with five RBIs and four runs scored, both of which also tied Roger Maris for the most in the series.

===1963 season===
After going 2-for-5 with an RBI in the Giants&#x27; 9–2 opening day victory, Hiller&#x27;s season took a sharp downward turn. On April 20, he committed three errors in a 4–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs. He also went 0-for-4 to drop his season average to .119. The table setter in the lead off spot a year ago scored just one run the first month of the season. He also didn&#x27;t collect a second RBI until the final game of the month. On May 1, he fractured his wrist, sidelining him for a month.

He led off the June 6 contest with the Cubs with a double to end an 0-for-27 skid. He showed steady improvement from there, batting .286 with nine runs over the rest of the month.

On June 15, future Hall of Famer Juan Marichal and the Colt .45s&#x27; Dick Drott embarked on a classic pitchers&#x27; duel. Al Spangler drew a walk off Marichal in the fifth for Houston&#x27;s first base runner. Drott gave up a single to Mays in the first, but did not give up a second hit until Davenport led off the eighth with a double. Two batters later, Hiller doubled, driving in the only run of Marichal&#x27;s only career no-hitter.

He clubbed his first home run of the season on June 19 against the Dodgers&#x27; Larry Sherry. His second was a walk off against the Pirates on July 26. An exceptional month of August (.289 avg., 3 HR, 13 RBI, 14 runs) helped him end the season with a somewhat acceptable .223 average, 33 RBIs and 44 runs. His six home runs were a career high.

His disappointing performance in 1963 made him a question mark heading into the season. Through mid-June, Hiller batted .189 with one home run, twelve RBIs, seventeen runs and six errors on the field. The Giants made the decision to move on to rookie prospect Hal Lanier. Over the remainder of the season, Hiller made just 65 plate appearances, and batted .158 with five RBIs and four runs scored.

==New York Mets==
When All-Star second baseman Ron Hunt separated his shoulder early in the season, the New York Mets purchased Hiller from the Giants. Hiller batted .258 with three home runs, twelve RBIs and sixteen runs in Hunt&#x27;s absence. He also committed eleven errors at second, including three consecutive games May 18–20.

Upon Hunt&#x27;s return, the Mets tried Hiller at third (he played one game at third with the Giants), and he made his debut as an outfielder on August 14. Overall, Hiller batted .238 with five home runs, 21 RBIs and 24 runs. He also hit one home run with the Giants to match his career high of six total.

He became manager Wes Westrum&#x27;s favorite bat off the bench in . On April 29, his extra innings pinch hit single drove in the winning run against the Pirates. Through June, Hiller batted .328 to prompt Westrum to find a position for him on the field to get his bat in the line up. In July, he began seeing more playing time at third and in the outfield. The Mets posted a winning record in July (18–14) for their first winning month in franchise history. Hiller batted .321.

He cooled off in the last two months of the season (.217, 1 HR, 5 RBI, 7 runs), but he still batted a career-best .280 for the season. He batted .348 as a pinch hitter with three walks. His sixteen pinch hits led the NL.

After the season, Hunt and Jim Hickman were traded to the Dodgers for Tommy Davis and Derrell Griffith. Unfortunately, Hiller squandered his opportunity to become the Mets&#x27; starting second baseman in by batting .111 with two RBIs through the first month of the season. An injury sidelined him for the month of May. When he returned, he had just one hit in eighteen at bats. Meanwhile, Jerry Buchek, acquired from the Cardinals at the end of Spring training for Eddie Bressoud and Danny Napoleon, played well enough to earn the starting job (.230 avg., 8 HR, 19 RBI). During the All-Star break, Hiller was traded to the Phillies for ex-Yankee infielder Phil Linz.

==Coaching==
Hiller made just four starts, and was used mostly as a pinch hitter in Philadelphia. After the season, he was sent to the minors, and selected by the Pirates in the rule 5 draft. He spent most of the season with the triple A Columbus Jets, batting .275 in 87 games. He made eleven appearances with the Pirates, going 5-for-13 with a double. After the season, he retired, and became manager of the Salem Rebels in the Carolina League.

Hiller returned to the Mets in a similar capacity, working for the Mets&#x27; director of player development, Whitey Herzog, through . Hiller then served under manager Herzog as an MLB coach with the Texas Rangers, Kansas City Royals and Cardinals, and later spent brief terms in the post with the Giants and the Mets. In between Hiller&#x27;s major-league assignments, he served the Mets as a longtime infield instructor in their minor league system, and managed in the Cardinals&#x27; organization.

On October 20, 2004, Hiller died from leukemia at age 70 in St. Pete Beach, Florida.

<text>Cardwell, a federal electoral district in the Canadian province of Ontario, was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1904. Cardwell is sometimes also considered one of Ontario&#x27;s historic counties, as Cardwell was listed in some post-Confederation census records as a county of residence.

Cardwell consisted of the Simcoe County townships of Adjala and Mono, and the Peel County townships of Albion (including the town of Bolton) and Caledon.

The Cardwell electoral district was abolished in 1903 when it was redistributed between Dufferin, Peel and Simcoe South ridings.

<text>Bec mac Dé was a legendary Irish prophet, known from saga literature surrounding the historical High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill and from the Irish Annals, where he is said to have died c. 553–7.

In the saga &quot;Aided Diarmata&quot; (&quot;the death of Diarmait&quot;) he is said to have been the best seer of his day, who could speak with nine men at once and answer all their questions in a single reply, and made an accurate prediction of the circumstances of Diarmait&#x27;s death. Two saints, Ronan and Ciarán, had prophesied he would be killed by a roofbeam falling on his head. Bec gave a more elaborate prophecy of a threefold death: he would be drowned, burned, and have his head crushed by a roofbeam, by Áed Dub mac Suibni, in the house of Banbán the hospitaller, on a night that he wore a shirt grown from a single flax seed, drank ale brewed from a single grain of corn, and ate pork from a sow that had never farrowed. Diarmait dismissed these prophecies, even when invited to a feast by Banbán. His wife, who had been listening, refused to go, so Banbán offered the king his own daughter for that night, and gave him a nightshirt, pork and ale. When the girl told him the nightshirt had been woven from flax grown from a single seed, the ale had been brewed from a single grain of corn, and the pork had come from a sow that had never farrowed, Diarmait realised the prophecy had been fulfilled, and tried to escape, but Áed Dubh was standing at the door with his spear. As Diarmait fled back into the house, Áed&#x27;s men set it on fire. Diarmait tried to escape the conflagration by leaping into a vat of ale, but a flaming roofbeam fell on his head, killing him.

A number of early Irish poems are attributed to him, including a prophecy &quot;detailing the moral breakdown presaging the end of the world&quot;. The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; record his death under the years 552 and 557, the &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; under 553, the &quot;Annals of Clonmacnoise&quot; under 550, and the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, where he is considered a Christian saint, under 557.

It is sometimes also considered one of Ontario&#x27;s historic counties, as it was listed in some post-Confederation census records as a county of residence.

Monck consisted of the Lincoln County townships of Caistor and Gainsborough, the Haldimand County townships of Canborough, Dunn, Dunnville, Moulton and Sherbrooke, and the Welland County townships of Pelham and Wainfleet.

In 1872, it was redefined to include the Township of Dunn (Haldimand). In 1882, it was redefined to include the Township of South Cayuga and exclude the Township of Caistor.

The electoral district was abolished in 1892 when it was redistributed between Haldimand and Monck and Lincoln and Niagara ridings.

<text>The Crown Range is a mountain range that lies to the east of the Wakatipu Basin in Otago, New Zealand. It is noted for two features, the Cardrona Alpine Resort, on the slopes of the 1900 metre Mount Cardrona, and a highway, known as the Crown Range Road (formerly State Highway 89), which winds steeply between Arrow Junction, just south of Arrowtown, and Wānaka to the north.

Travelling from Arrowtown towards Wānaka, the Crown Range Road starts at the bottom of the &quot;zig zag&quot;. This steep and winding section climbs to the Crown Terrace, a large flat and fertile area capable of growing grain crops. To the left, Glencoe Road leads to Glencoe Station, the large high country station behind Arrowtown. At the end of the Crown Terrace is the Eastburn Road to Eastburn Station, which runs from the Glencoe boundary almost to Cardrona.

Just past the Eastburn Road the road twists and climbs up to the Crown Saddle, where a bronze plaque at the vista point claims that this historic summit, at 1076 m (3530 ft) is the highest sealed road in New Zealand. Officially it is the highest sealed local road and the highest sealed pass or through road, 2m higher than the Desert Road summit on State Highway 1 in the North Island. 

Eastburn Station has provided a number of viewing areas. The distant views down and over Lake Hayes, Arrowtown and the airport to Queenstown are stunning. From the Crown Saddle the road follows the Cardrona creek which becomes the Cardrona River flowing down the iconic snow tussock valley until it opens out at the small settlement of Cardrona. The valley separates the Crown Range in the west from the Criffel Range in the east.

The area was heavily populated during the Otago gold rush of the 1860s, the town of Cardrona, now little more than a dot on the map, briefly having a population of several thousand prospectors. There are visible remains of gold prospecting beside the Crown Range Road over the saddle on the west bank opposite the East Burn Stream two miles over the saddle, also six miles below the saddle on the east bank.

In 2001, the last section of the Crown Range Road was sealed by the Queenstown Lakes District Council.

<doc id="1088579" wikidata="Q1025909" url="?curid=1088579" title="Cairbre Nia Fer">
<text>Cairbre Nia Fer (also &quot;Corpri&quot;, &quot;Coirpre&quot;, &quot;Cairpre&quot;; &quot;Nioth Fer&quot;, &quot;Niafer&quot;, &quot;Niaper&quot;), son of Rus Ruad, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a King of Tara from the Laigin.

The earliest reference to Cairbre is in Tírechán&#x27;s Memoir of Saint Patrick, a 7th-century Latin text found in the Book of Armagh. Patrick finds an enormous grave and raises its giant occupant from the dead. The giant says he was killed by the sons of Mac Con during the reign of Cairbre Nia Fer, a hundred years previously – i.e. in the 4th century. Another early reference is in the annotations to the 7th-century &quot;Amra Choluim Chille&quot; (eulogy of Colm Cille) by Dallán Forgaill. Here, the saint&#x27;s mother Eithne is said to be a descendant of Cairbre, and Cairbre a descendant of Cathair Mór.

The 11th century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; places him during the reign of the High King Eterscél, which it synchronises his reign with that of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 BC - AD 14) and the birth of Christ, and makes him a contemporary of the provincial kings Conchobar mac Nessa of the Ulaid, Cú Roí of Munster and Ailill mac Máta of Connacht. Mac Con of the Dáirine, placed a generation before Cairbre by Tírechán, is dated many generations after him, to the late 2nd century, in the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot;, while Cathair Mór, his ancestor in the &quot;Amra Choluim Chille&quot;, is placed many generations later.

Alongside Conchobar, Cú Roí and Ailill, Cairbre appears as king of Tara in stories of the Ulster Cycle, where he is the brother of Ailill mac Máta, husband of Medb of Connacht. His wife is Fedelm Noíchrothach, daughter of Conchobar, and they have a son, Erc, and a daughter, Achall. In &quot;Cath Ruis na Ríg&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Rosnaree&quot;), he and his brother Find mac Rossa, king of the Gailióin of Leinster, fight a battle against Conchobar and the Ulaid. The Ulaid hero Cúchulainn kills him with a spear from distance, then decapitates him before his body hits the ground. After the Ulaid win the battle, Cairbre&#x27;s son Erc swears allegiance to Conchobar, marries Cúchulainn&#x27;s daughter Finnscoth, and becomes king of Tara in his father&#x27;s place.

Erc is later part of the conspiracy to kill Cúchulainn. After avenging Cúchulainn, Conall Cernach brings Erc&#x27;s head back to Tara, where Achall dies of grief for her brother.

Lennox County was combined with Addington County and Amherst Island in 1800 to become the incorporated counties of Lennox and Addington. The counties would regain their separate identities in 1845, but would continue to be united for electoral purposes.

At the beginning of 1850, Midland District was abolished, and the United Counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. In 1860, Lennox and Addington were formally amalgamated as the County of Lennox and Addington.

<text>The Ramavataram, popularly referred to as Kamba Ramayanam, is a Tamil epic that was written by the Tamil poet Kambar during the 12th century. Based on Valmiki&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana&quot; (which is in Sanskrit), the story describes the legend of King Rama of Ayodhya. However, the &quot;Ramavataram&quot; is different from the Sanskrit version in many aspects – both in spiritual concepts and in the specifics of the storyline. This historic work is considered by both Tamil scholars and the general public as one of the greatest literary works in Tamil literature.

Kambar wrote this epic with the patronage of Thiruvennai Nallur Sadayappa Vallal, a chieftain of the Pannai lineage. In gratitude to his patron, Kamban references his name once in every 1,000 verses.

==Early references in Tamil literature==

Even before Kambar wrote the Ramavataram in Tamil in the 12 century CE, there are many ancient references to the story of Ramayana, implying that the story was familiar in the Tamil lands even before the Common Era. References to the story can be found in the Sangam literature of Akanaṉūṟu,(dated 200 BCE–300 CE) and Purananuru (dated 200 BCE–300 CE), the twin epics of Silappatikaram (dated 6th century CE) and Manimekalai, and the Alvar literature of Kulasekhara Alvar, Thirumangai Alvar, Andal and Nammalvar (dated between 8th and 10th centuries CE).

==Structure==
The book is divided into six chapters, called &quot;Kandam&quot; in Tamil. The Kandams are further divided into 113 sections called &quot;Padalam&quot; (படலம்) in Tamil. These 113 sections contain approximately 10569 verses of the epic.

* Bala Kandam (Chapter: Childhood)
* Ayodhya Kandam (Chapter: Ayodhya)
* Aranya Kandam (Chapter: Forest)
* Kishkindha Kandam (Chapter: Kishkindha)
* Sundara Kandam (Chapter: Beautiful)
* Yuddha Kandam (Chapter: War)

==Compilation==
As with many historic compilations, it was very difficult to discard the interpolations and addendum which have been added over a period of time to the original. This task was taken up a committee of scholars headed by T. P. Meenakshisundaram called the Kamban Kazhagam (Kamban Academy). The compilation published by this committee in 1976 is what is used as the standard today. Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana in Sanskrit has seven chapters. The Tamil poet Ottakoothar wrote Uttara Kandam, the seventh (last chapter) kandam of the Tamil epic Ramayanam.

==Literary significance==
Kamban&#x27;s use of Virutham (Sanskrit: vṛttam) and Santham (Sanskrit: chandas) in various verses is effective in bringing out the emotion and mood for storytelling. He achieves the Virutham and Santham by effective choice of words.

==Religious significance==
This epic is read by many Hindus during prayers. In some households, the entire epic is read once during the Tamil calendar&#x27;s month of Aadi (mid-July to mid-August). It is also read in Hindu Temples and other religious associations. On many occasions, Kambar talks about surrendering to Rama, who is a manifestation of Vishnu himself.

The chapter &quot;Sundara Kandam&quot; is considered very auspicious and is the most popular. The chapter talks about the hardships faced by the main characters in the epic, their practice of restraint, and their hopes for a better tomorrow.

==Translations==
Kamba Ramayanam has been translated into English by P. S. Sundaram. Nityananda Mohapatra translated the Tamil work into Odia.

<text>Biddenden is a large, mostly agricultural and wooded village and civil parish in the borough of Ashford in Kent, England. The village lies on the Weald of Kent, north of Tenterden. It was a centre for the Wealden iron industry and clothmaking.

The parish includes the hamlet Woolpack Corner ().

==Origin of Name==
The place name Biddenden is derived from the Kentish dialect of Old English, meaning &quot;Bidda&#x27;s woodland pasture&quot;. It is associated with a man called &quot;Bida,&quot; and was originally &quot;Biddingden&quot; (c993) &quot;Bida&quot; + &quot;ing&quot; + &quot;denn&quot;, eventually evolving into the current spelling.

==History==

All Saints Biddenden is the parish church, built mostly in the 13th century. There was likely an earlier Saxon church here. During the half-century reign of Edward III, Flemish clothworkers were settled in the area. The ready availability of raw materials led to the establishment of a flourishing textile industry for the production of broadcloth. Wealth from this industry built many of the fine houses in town.

Biddenden Place was the ancestral home of the Mayney or Mayne family: the village school, originally founded in 1522, is named after its benefactor John Mayne. 

==Biddenden Maids==
In 1100, Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, a pair of conjoined twins, were supposedly born in the village. The origin of the perpetual charity of Biddenden is celebrated in the village signage of the Biddenden Maids, as they became known. The Biddenden Consolidated Charity provides Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribution of Biddenden cakes.

== Demography ==
At the 2001 UK census, the Biddenden electoral ward had a population of 2,434. The ethnicity was 98.7% white, 0.4% mixed race, 0.3% Asian, 0.5% black and 0.1% other. The place of birth of residents was 94.2% United Kingdom, 0.4% Republic of Ireland, 1.6% other Western European countries, and 3.8% elsewhere. Religion was recorded as 78.6% Christian, 0.3% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu, 0% Sikh, 0% Jewish, and 0.1% Muslim. 12.7% were recorded as having no religion, 0.3% had an alternative religion and 7.9% did not state their religion.

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 32.8% in full-time employment, 12.5% in part-time employment, 16.9% self-employed, 1.7% unemployed, 1.1% students with jobs, 2.4% students without jobs, 18.8% retired, 9.4% looking after home or family, 2.5% permanently sick or disabled and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. The industry of employment of residents was 13.9% retail, 9.5% manufacturing, 10.3% construction, 14.3% real estate, 10.3% health and social work, 7.2% education, 4.7% transport and communications, 5.2% public administration, 4.9% hotels and restaurants, 5.7% finance, 5.8% agriculture and 8.2% other. Compared with national figures, the ward had a relatively high proportion of workers in agriculture and construction. There were a relatively low proportion in manufacturing, transport and communications. Of the ward&#x27;s residents aged 16–74, 19.6% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 19.9% nationwide.

An important cottage industry has developed to the west, where numerous vineyards and orchards produce varietal wines, ciders and juices. Biddenden is also the trading name of Biddenden&#x27;s Cider. Biddenden&#x27;s Cider is made by Biddenden Vineyards Ltd. whose premises are close to the clustered village centre.

==Transport==
Biddenden was served for nearly five decades by Biddenden railway station, on the Kent and East Sussex Railway. The station opened on 15 May 1905 and closed on 4 January 1954.

Bygone Buses was based in Biddenden during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was sold to Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services.

<text>Celtchar, son of Uthechar or Uthidir, is a character from the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology. In &quot;Scéla Mucce Maic Dathó&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Mac Dathó&#x27;s Pig&quot;) he is described as &quot;a grey, tall, very terrible hero of Ulster&quot;. When he challenges Cet mac Mágach for the champion&#x27;s portion, Cet counters that he once emasculated Celtchar with a spear at Celtchar&#x27;s own house. He lives in Dún Lethglaise, also known as the Mound of Down (Irish &quot;Dún&quot;), or Rathkeltair (Irish &quot;Ráth Celtchair&quot; or Celtchar&#x27;s Fort) in Downpatrick, County Down. His wife is Findmór of Dún Sobairche (Dunseverick, County Antrim). He wields a spear or lance, the &quot;Lúin Cheltchair&quot;, whose lust for blood is so great it has to be dipped in a cauldron of poison to control it.

In the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, after the Ulstermen have roused from their debility, he and Conchobar mac Nessa rescue eight captive Ulster women from eight men of Ailill and Medb&#x27;s household at Áth Féinne.

In compensation for murdering Blaí Briugu, who had slept with his wife, Celtchar has to rid Ulster of three menaces. The first is Conganchnes mac Dedad, who seeks revenge for the death of his nephew Cú Roí, and who has skin like horn, which no weapon can pierce. Celtchar offers him his daughter Niam in marriage, who discovers that Conganchnes can only be killed by hammering red hot spits into the soles of his feet. She passes the information to her father, who does the deed. The second menace is a ferocious dog called &quot;Luch Donn&quot; (&quot;brown mouse&quot;). It had been found as a pup by a widow, who raised it until it was enormous and uncontrollable. It killed all the widow&#x27;s sheep and cattle, then her sons, and finally the widow herself, and now it devastates a settlement every night. Celtchar finds an alder log, hollows it out so his arm will fit through it, and boils it in honey, grease and herbs until it is tough and supple. He approaches the dog with the log over his arm, and when the dog bites into it its teeth get stuck, enabling Celtchar to pull its heart out through its throat, killing it. The third menace is Dóelchú, Celtchar&#x27;s own dog. It was found as a pup inside Conganchnes&#x27;s burial mound, and would only let Celtchar handle it, until one day it escaped, and became a menace to the cattle and sheep of Ulster. Celtchar finds the dog and calls to it, and it comes and licks his feet. Reluctantly, Celtchar dispatches it with his spear. As he lifts the spear, a drop of the dog&#x27;s poisonous blood runs down it and through Celtchar&#x27;s body, killing him.

<text>The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) is an Australian trade union for all higher education and university employees. It is an industry union, and the only union working exclusively in the Australian university sector.

== Overview ==
The NTEU is a specialist national union solely representing staff in tertiary education. In all Australian universities, the NTEU represents professional staff, academic staff, research staff, general staff, ELICOS teachers, and staff of Student Unions and university companies. In Victoria, the NTEU also represents TAFE general staff and all staff in Adult Education.

The NTEU was formed out of previous tertiary education staff associations, principally the Federation of University Staff Associations and the Federation of College Academics. It is generally considered to be more towards the left of the union movement, and has a high focus on self-directed membership branches and the organising model of unionism. The NTEU often engages in organising campaigns to build its membership density.

The NTEU is not affiliated with any Australian political party.

== Campaigns ==
Our Universities Matter is a major national campaign being run by the NTEU, launched in 2008.

The campaign seeks to:

* Achieve higher levels of government funding and better funding mechanisms.
* Protect university independence and freedom of inquiry.
* Introduce controls on excessive workloads, better job security and a competitive pay rise for university staff.
* Win a better deal for students around affordability and improved student services.

Academic Freedom Watch is a site established to promote academic freedom in Australia&#x27;s universities. Created by the Victorian Division, the site includes debates and articles written by high-profile academics in this area.

Our TAFEs Matter is the campaign to promote Victoria&#x27;s TAFE system, which is being undermined by changes in funding systems by the Victorian Government. The changes would introduce a HECS-style loan scheme, more than double student fees and reduce public TAFE funding certainty. During 2019 and 2020 members at the University of Melbourne formed a casuals network. This ran campaigns against underpayment which culminated in the university repaying $45 million in wages to current and former staff.

=== Sentry ===

==== Introduction ====
&quot;Sentry&quot; is the NTEU&#x27;s online magazine for all members during the pandemic. It is published monthly between issues of &quot;Advocate&quot;. It contains updates on campaigns and policy work, member stories and information from member experts.

<doc id="1088597" wikidata="Q3094501" url="?curid=1088597" title="Organizing model">
<text>The organizing model, as the term refers to trade unions (and sometimes other social-movement organizations), is a broad conception of how those organizations should recruit, operate, and advance the interests of their members, though the specific functions of the model are more detailed and are discussed at length below. It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the discussion of how trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations, and how they can recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century.

The organizing model is frequently compared and contrasted with other methods of union organization, such as the servicing model. There is disagreement as to the logistics of applying the organizing model and whether it should focus on organizing existing members, recruiting new members, or both. The prominence of the model and the debate over its worth are seen primarily in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

==Definition==

The principal aim of the organizing model is that of giving power directly to union members. The organizing model in its ideal type has these features:

* Strong emphasis on the importance of personal contact in organizing. Union officials are, according to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, &quot;paid&quot;, as opposed to being volunteers from the union itself. These are the same people who, had they been employing the service model in their union, would have been offering services to the members, but instead they focus their efforts on organizing the union members to act on their own behalf, rather than simply offering them services.
* To facilitate this type of organization, organizers will often put in long hours talking to workers about their situation, and what they believe the union can help them achieve. Visits to workers&#x27; homes will often be a component of this. 
* Acceptance of the view that workers need to take some appreciable responsibility for winning union struggles and making the union strong. 
* The identification and recruitment of volunteer leaders from among the workforce, to spread information about the union and encourage others to join and take action.
* Proactive recruitment drives conducted by either the paid organizers, the volunteers from the union, or both. The important part of the recruitment aspect of the organizing model is, according to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, ensuring &quot;the principle of &#x27;like-recruits-like&#x27; such that the recruiters have the same demographic and occupational identity as those being recruited.&quot; Though, there can be unions that employ the organizing model without necessarily emphasizing recruitment. 
* As a component of these recruitment drives, Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon also discuss &quot;mapping&quot; of workplaces as a key component of the organizing model, and they also make it clear that the goal of mapping is to &quot;...identify all members of the workplace and rank them systematically in terms of their propensity to become active in the union.&quot; 
* Proactive campaigning, involving a large commitment of resources and large numbers of members. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon assert that this campaigning has to be focused on specific &quot;issues and grievances&quot;, rather than campaigning without any specific, tangible goals in mind. 
* Creative campaigning tactics – including demonstrations, street theatre, media stunts, direct action, civil disobedience, music etc.
* A conception of leadership in which leaders are those willing to take the initiative and contribute effort, rather than one based on authority. It is often the goal for leadership (as the confidence to initiate organization with others) will spread as broadly as possible.
* Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon also offer &quot;community support&quot; as a key to the success of the organizing model. As a way to maintain or even incite this support from the community, Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon suggest &quot;publicising concessions from the employer&quot;. 
* Typically a relatively high level of membership dues relative for industrial—as opposed to craft—unions.

==Organizing versus servicing==
The development of the organizing model is as opposed to the servicing model, and there are various differences between the two models for union structure. Edmund Heery, Melanie Simms, Dave Simpson, Rick Delbridge, and John Salmon talk about how in the servicing model, &quot;...the function of the union is to deliver collective and individual services to members who are dependent on the formal organization and its hierarchy of officers to provide what they require.&quot; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that the organizing model is different from the servicing model because it focuses instead on making union members feel &quot;empowered&quot;, rather than alienated from the whole union process and environment.

Jack Fiorito states that the organizing model and the servicing model cannot be considered separate and there needs to be provision for using both models at the same time; Fiorito&#x27;s research about British union members showed that &quot;...a large number of responses express reservations about the OM or at least the organizing vs. servicing dichotomy suggested. Many of these responses emphasize the importance of service as an aid to organizing (18%) or something that is expected by the members (23%).&quot; Fiorito believes that the organizing model and the servicing model are not mutually exclusive in some cases; there are some instances when the two models could be complementary. The debate over the organizing model versus the servicing model is widespread and multifaceted. Even the goals of the organizing model are debated and disagreed upon.

==Internal versus external==
According to Bill Fletcher and Richard W. Hurd, unions that employ the organizing model often try to apply the above tactics in &quot;internal&quot;, not just &quot;external&quot; campaigns. Indeed, many unions that employ the organizing model attempt to win a greater right to organize non-union workers through pressuring an employer through using current members&#x27; collective strength. Richard Hurd says that &quot;Throughout the late 1980s the &quot;organizing model&quot; was used almost exclusively to apply to internal organizing;&quot; however, &quot;...by 1995 the &quot;organizing model&quot; concept was indiscriminately used to refer to both internal organizing to mobilize members and external organizing that promotes grassroots activism as a way to build support for union representation.&quot;

There is debate as to the proper role of the organizing model and whether it should focus on internal or on external applications. Bob Carter talks about the difference between internal organizing and external organizing in the context of the earliest British unions to use the organizing model. Carter says that &quot;...despite the core message of the American model – that organization, rather than recruitment as such, was primary – officers were given individual recruitment targets...placing an emphasis not so much on the changing nature of unionism but simply on short-term recruitment.&quot; There is an apparent disconnect between employing the organizing model primarily for recruitment purposes and using the organizing model to facilitate better union conditions for pre-existing members of the union.

According to Fletcher and Hurd, exactly what constitutes internal organizing and what constitutes external organizing is unclear. Jack Fiorito offers an argument about internal vs. external organizing in the context of British unions. Fiorito says that external organizing is &quot;...organizing in new areas...&quot;, while internal organizing is &quot;...recruitment in sites where the union has recognition...&quot; Fletcher and Hurd believe that the organizing model should be more focused on external, rather than internal, organizing, and they cite &quot;Organizing Locals&quot; as a good example of how that could be accomplished.

==History and context==
Trade unions originally existed to organize their members democratically, and during their early growth, they typically put a strong emphasis on active recruitment and militant rank and file action, including strikes. By no means did they always unambiguously act in the interests of their members, but they were perceived as organizations that existed to struggle for collective action. Particularly since the end of World War II, however, the trade unions have tended more and more to act as service providers for their members: providing legal advice, training and so on; eschewing mass-based, militant action. During the &#x27;60s, &#x27;70s and onward, this trend deepened, with union density among the workforce falling all the while, until it could be measured at between 10% and 20% in many industrialized countries. In the context of this history, the organizing model is in principle not so much a new conception, as an attempt to recapture the essence of the labor movement.

The 1980s saw various attempts, in the United States, to compensate for falling union membership. Richard Hurd says that through the adoption of the &quot;Organizing Institute&quot; in the US, the organizing model was able to spread to other countries, as it &quot;...served as a prototype for Australia&#x27;s Organizing Works and Britain&#x27;s Organizing Academy.&quot; Bob Carter explains the logistics how the organizing model spread across the world. Carter says that &quot;After a visit to the US of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the influence of the organising approach spread to Australia and New Zealand and back to Britain via MSF.&quot; Carter asserts that the organizing model started in the US, went to Australia and New Zealand next, and then went to the UK. David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that the ways these various countries implemented the organizing model were quite different, and the model looked slightly different based upon these minor discrepancies.

==History in the United States==
According to Richard W. Hurd, the history of the organizing model in the US began from the failure of a &quot;labor law&quot; to be passed in the 1970s. In addition, Hurd explains that the 1980s were a very troubling time for unions in the US as a result of &quot;the anti-union reign of Ronald Reagan&quot; and &quot;Twin recessions&quot;. Both of these factors contributed to the decline of union membership that so infamously characterized the labor movement in the US in the 1980s. In fact, Hurd says that, &quot;The labor movement lost more than one-fifth of its private sector members during the first half of the 1980s.&quot; Therefore, US unions were forced to try some new tactics in the hopes of regaining the membership they were losing.

In response to this labor crisis, the AFL–CIO made many attempts to renew its labor movement in the 1980s, but none of them were successful. However, in 1988, an AFL–CIO-organized teleconference of trade unionists recognized the potential of the nascent organizing model, gave it its name, and resolved to spread it throughout the trade-union movement: this was an element in the model&#x27;s popularization. After the teleconference, the AFL–CIO, according to Hurd, established the &quot;Organizing Institute&quot;, and the goal of the institute was &quot;to train union organizers.&quot; While, as Richard Hurd suggests, the attempts at reigniting the flame of union membership were largely unsuccessful, in 1995, former SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL–CIO on the New Voice slate, on a platform of spreading the organizing model across the members of the federation. According to Richard Hurd, when Sweeney took over, he created an &quot;Organizing Department&quot; to enhance the strategy of employing the organizing model throughout the AFL–CIO, and he encouraged unions to begin &quot;devoting 30% of their budgets to recruitment.&quot; The extent of the success of this is disputed, with some suggesting that more rhetoric has changed than anything, but it did have at least some effect. Richard Hurd suggests that &quot;The reality is that the individual national unions determine their own resource allocations and develop their own organizing programs,&quot; but &quot;Most unions have increased the funding of their organizing departments, and many have devoted substantial resources to the effort.&quot; This is how the AFL–CIO tried to implement the organizing model in response to the membership crisis.

In the mid-1980s, the SEIU union found itself in a similar state of crisis. A period of intense internal discussion gave rise to the view that a radical program was needed to rebuild the union and make it relevant to current and potential members. The Justice for Janitors campaign was launched as the organizational spearhead of the SEIU&#x27;s attempt to reinvigorate their membership; beginning in Denver, Colorado, in 1985. In addition to the Justice for Janitors campaign, according to Jennifer Jihye Chun, around the same time, the SEIU also engaged in campaigns for &quot;home care workers&quot; in Los Angeles. Chun says that &quot;Through a combination of aggressive grassroots organizing strategies, a focused political action campaign, and mass worker mobilizations, SEIU organizers were able to sign up 15,000 workers.&quot;

Working along the lines described above, the SEIU experienced huge growth in membership and a significant number of high-profile public victories for workers. (Though some proportion of the SEIU&#x27;s membership growth has resulted from mergers, such as with 1199). The tactics and strategies of the SEIU and Justice for Janitors go beyond the organizing model which is, as has been described, an approach to local-level organizing and campaigning. It applies to a drive for the recruitment of members and leaders on the level of a firm or city. Other aspects of the SEIU&#x27;s strategies are national or international. For instance, the drive to gain industry-wide coverage across a large geographical base – i.e., to organize janitors not only within one building but across a whole city, state and eventually all across the US – or the advocacy of union mergers.

==History in Australia==
After a wave of massive industrial unrest and unprecedented increases in wages and conditions during the 1970s, the union movement became restrained in their demands, and part of the official apparatus of government during the ALP-led, neo-corporatist, Accord period (1983–96). According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the ALP and the ACTU formed the &quot;Accord&quot; by establishing a formal &quot;relationship&quot; with each other While unions had amalgamated prior to the Accord, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions had itself absorbed other lesser peak industrial councils, the accord period and the later enterprise bargaining period encouraged mergers into super unions. These super unions often obliterated previous small union identities and loyalties (on both the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; of the trade union movement) and created unions with a relatively artificial internal culture. Often the largest union in the merger imposed its internal culture on the other divisions of the new union. Additionally, during the period of mergers, the traditional links between members, local organisers, industrial officers, branches and the peak leaderships of unions broke down. This presented a challenge to the union movement. According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the Accord period was very harmful to labor unions, and the super unions did not do anything drastic to improve the conditions of the unions.

Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that the 1980s and 1990s were particularly bad decades for Australian unions. According to Carter and Cooper, the decline of union membership was worse, during the 1980s and the 1990s, in Australia than it was in the U.K. Carter and Cooper explain that the membership decline in Australian unions was the result of the &quot;...pro-active anti-union approach...&quot; by the &quot;...conservative Coalition federal government...&quot;, along with other &quot;...structural changes in the labor market.&quot; Peetz and Pocock state that during the 1980s and the 1990s, unions had to deal with &quot;...outright hostility...&quot; and &quot;...successive pieces of legislation...&quot; that were harmful to their membership and growth.

The response to this union crisis in Australia is the &quot;Organising Works&quot; program which was established in 1994 to recruit organizers from union members and university students. The Organizing Works Program, in Australia, was established after representatives from Australian unions visited the US and observed the organizing model in practice. Organising Works is a relatively unique program in Australia, in that it combines explicit training in trade unionism with an apprenticeship system with specific trade unions. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that Organizing Works was successful in spreading the message of the model and recruiting new members for unions, and in general, Australian unions were more committed to the organizing model than were British unions. David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that in the first six years of the Organizing Works Program in Australia, &quot;...it had produced over 300 trainees...&quot; Carter and Cooper discuss the &quot;Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU)&quot; as one of the main Australian unions to implement the organizing model on a large scale in response to union decline. Peetz and Pocock talk about the &quot;Unions@Work&quot; report that was published for unions in 1999, which even continued the mission of the Organizing Works program. Peetz and Pocock emphasize that the organizing model was implemented differently in different Australian unions and that the aspects of the organizing model that got implemented differed by union.

==History in the UK and Ireland==
According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the U.K. went through several decades of uncertainty for unions. Specifically, conditions of the 1970s through the 1990s in the U.K. were particularly prone to hostile conditions for unions. Carter and Cooper state that British unions, like the &quot;Trades Union Congress (TUC)&quot; had to face &quot;government hostility&quot; and &quot;job losses&quot;. In response to unfavorable conditions for unions, according to Carter and Cooper, the TUC tried implementing the &quot;servicing&quot; model, but it failed to provide measurable improvements in the labor movement or in &quot;membership&quot;. According to Bob Carter, the &quot;first major British union&quot; to employ the organizing model was &quot;Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF)&quot;, not necessarily the TUC. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that MSF was a combined union, which was formed from both the &quot;Association of Scientific, Technical, Managerial, and Supervisory Staffs (ASTMS)&quot; and the &quot;Technical Advisory Staffs (TASS).&quot; Bob Carter says that when ASTMS and TASS came together to form MSF, the merged organization more closely resembled ASTMS than TASS. According to Carter and Cooper, the history of the ASTMS showed that it was &quot;...a much looser form of organization&quot;, while TASS was more &quot;Communist.&quot; Carter states that MSF began implementing the &quot;MSF policy &quot;Organising Works&quot;&quot; in 1996. Carter makes the case that the MSF&#x27;s implementation of the organizing model came after they tried &quot;Reinforcement of a servicing culture...&quot;, which was, overall, not very successful. This is why they switched their strategy toward using the organizing model, rather than the servicing model. However, according to Carter, MSF had many problems arise in the wake of the model&#x27;s adoption, such as the fact that &quot;It was conceived and implemented from the top downwards... without wide discussion in the union.&quot; Carter sees this as a fundamental problem posed by the organizing model, and he thinks it must be overcome in order for it to be effective.

Carter states that the same time period also saw the &quot;launch of the TUC&#x27;s New Unionism project in 1996.&quot; Both unions, MSF and the TUC, were implementing new policies of employing the organizing model in an attempt to revitalize the conditions of their unions. The 1990s in the U.K. were especially geared toward experimentation and reorientation of the labor market toward being influential again. Carter and Cooper question how successful the New Unionism Project was in facilitating growth and organizing for unions. Carter and Cooper suggest that one of the main problems with the New Unionism was that it was too focused on negotiating with the &quot;employer&quot;, rather than just focusing on the goals of the workers. Carter and Cooper state that the TUC had no real power over its &quot;affiliates&quot;, except setting a good example and hoping that the affiliated unions follow their lead by implementing the organizing model.

The British Trades Union Congress (TUC) inaugurated an Organising Academy in 1998, to fulfill a similar role to that of the AFL-CIO&#x27;s Organizing Institute in the US (or ACTU&#x27;s Organising Works programme in Australia). Carter and Cooper question how successful the Academy was in spreading the organizing model because of the lack of &quot;trainees&quot; from some unions. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that, while the spread of the organizing model was the primary goal of the Academy, the Academy was actually dedicated to helping people traditionally underrepresented in the labor unions, such as &quot;women&quot; and the &quot;young&quot; or those with &quot;non-standard&quot; employment. While the graduates of the Academy have produced positive results, in general the model has not been implemented in the UK with the same comprehensive commitment as it has been by some unions in the US. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that U.K. unions are more likely to adopt the organizing model if they are or have been affiliated with &quot;the Academy&quot;, so the Academy has had a measurable impact on the implementation of the organizing model within the U.K.

There are questions raised by writers on Industrial Relations about whether the transfer of the SEIU&#x27;s organizing model has been faithful, or whether a watered down, less radical version has been instantiated. Sarah Oxenbridge, for example, writes &quot;community organising and organising model methods provided the means by which Californian Unionists put their &#x27;social movement unionism&#x27; philosophies and strategies into practice, on a daily basis (see Heery 1998). However, it may be that most British Trade Unionists will instead see the organising model as – more simply – a range of &quot;recruitment tactics&quot;, and will pick and choose from amongst these tactics.&quot; Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon have isolated several aspects of the organizing model that are likely to appear in the U.K., namely &quot;one-to-one recruitment&quot;, and &quot;petitions, surveys and demonstrations&quot;. Heery Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon emphasize that these are only some of the core aspects of the organizing model, not all of them. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon state that British unions are more likely to employ the organizing model, rather than the serving model, if they are bigger and more open to influence from &quot;other countries&quot;.

According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, British unions are more likely to focus on the ideological basis for the organizing model, rather than the practical applications of it. Jack Fiorito states that the U.K.&#x27;s adaptation of the organizing model has some very specific characteristics that may or may not be seen in other countries. Fiorito lists &quot;...less reliance on paid staff and much lower dues levels in U.K. unions...&quot; as important features of the organizing model in the U.K. Fiorito did extensive research about the condition of British unions in the 2000s, which demonstrated that the organizing model was influential in British unions in the 2000s. When Fiorito interviewed U.K. union members during this timeframe, &quot;Almost half of respondents (45%) volunteer that their union is adopting the OM,&quot; which is Fiorito&#x27;s abbreviation for the organizing model. The organizing model was present in many British unions in the 2000s, and the workers were aware of its presence. The British union members largely felt that the organizing model was a good model to have implemented in their unions, and they were satisfied with its results. Fiorito states that &quot;Although the OM varies somewhat in meaning, a strong majority of unionists feel that their union is truly committed to recruiting and organizing new members...&quot;.

The Irish general union SIPTU established an Organizing Unit in 2004 and its president, Jack O&#x27;Connor, set as his objective the transformation of SIPTU – hitherto firmly committed to a servicing agenda – into an organizing union. SIPTU is also seeking to learn from the experience of the SEIU. It remains to be seen how (and whether) a commitment to the organizing model of trade unionism can be reconciled with the union&#x27;s traditional support for national &#x27;Social Partnership&#x27;.

The Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G) has begun to make some of the more serious moves of any of the larger British unions to learn from the SEIU&#x27;s strategies – though some smaller unions (such as Community) have been applying the organizing model for some years. In 2005, the T&amp;G launched a Justice for Cleaners campaign, which has been organizing workers in Canary Wharf, the Houses of Parliament, and, towards the end of the year, on the London Underground. In the former of these two, improvements in wages have been won by workers. The tactics of Social Movement Unionism have been utilized, insofar as the campaign organizers have worked closely with, for example, The East London Citizens Organisation (TELCO), which has brought in members of faith groups and other trade union branches. However, there remain concerns about the T&amp;G&#x27;s commitment to rank and file workers&#x27; action, considering how the union acted during the Gate Gourmet strike.

==Advantages==
Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon assert that the organizing model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such as the fact that the organizing model promotes &quot;systematic&quot;, proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union&#x27;s goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union&#x27;s future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the &quot;...core role of trade unions&quot;. This is to say that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should be doing in regard to their members.

==Disadvantages==

===Practical disadvantages===

Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several disadvantages of the union organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very &quot;resource-intensive&quot;, in terms of both people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about &quot;...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions.&quot; Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still have to learn how to perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and there have to be enough active members to facilitate this kind of action. This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, &quot;Employers are often resistant.&quot; Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.

Fletcher and Hurd state that unions may also face issues of resistance by pre-existing &quot;staff&quot;, who may be hesitant or even suspicious at the adoption of the organizing model. Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, based on the fact that unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, &quot;...following the organizing model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model.&quot; Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create &quot;...continual warfare...&quot; between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers &quot;...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle.&quot; If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that &quot;...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications&quot; because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that &quot;A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion...&quot; Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with the organizing model.

===Criticisms from the Left===
Most practical criticism of the model has emerged as a criticism of the practice of the model by the SEIU and other organizing unions, especially in America. Criticisms from the left generally contrast (explicitly or not) the organizing model to a rank and file model, in which the confrontational style of organizing, and broad-based member involvement in campaigning is supplemented by broad-based member power. According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the organizing model is not inherently &quot;democratic&quot;. In the organizing model, the workers are not as active as they could be, and staff are still responsible for many aspects of union organizing. Carter and Cooper believe that the organizing model is rather limited in terms of its scale, and it cannot start a &quot;...wider working class movement&quot;.

===Criticisms from the Right===
Critics argue that the organizing model is inappropriate to the task of unions in the modern global economy. They say that industrial disputes of the type that organising engenders are harmful to the national economies in which they occur: by increasing uncertainty and raising wages (labor costs), they will make economies less attractive to inward investment. Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment, there is, the fewer jobs there will be. The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions should emphasize their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee. In addition, there are the criticisms leveled by the anti-union Right, who often associate collective action with the tyranny of &#x27;Big labor&#x27;, contrasted to the free operation of the capitalist labor market.

<text>In fungi, a basidiocarp, basidiome, or basidioma () is the sporocarp of a basidiomycete, the multicellular structure on which the spore-producing hymenium is borne. Basidiocarps are characteristic of the hymenomycetes; rusts and smuts do not produce such structures. As with other sporocarps, epigeous (above-ground) basidiocarps that are visible to the naked eye (especially those with a more or less agaricoid morphology) are commonly referred to as mushrooms, while hypogeous (underground) basidiocarps are usually called false truffles.

==Structure==
All basidiocarps serve as the structure on which the hymenium is produced. Basidia are found on the surface of the hymenium, and the basidia ultimately produce spores. In its simplest form, a basidiocarp consists of an undifferentiated fruiting structure with a hymenium on the surface; such a structure is characteristic of many simple jelly and club fungi. In more complex basidiocarps, there is differentiation into a stipe, a pileus, and/or various types of hymenophores.

==Types==


Basidiocarps are classified into various types of growth forms based on the degree of differentiation into a stipe, pileus, and hymenophore, as well as the type of hymenophore, if present.

Growth forms include:

*Jelly fungus – fruiting body is jelly-like.
*Club fungus and coral fungus – erect fruiting body without a distinct stalk and cap, either unbranched (club fungus) or profusely branched (coral fungus).
*Polypore – underside of the fruiting body usually consists of tubes; otherwise very variable, usually wood-inhabiting
*tooth fungus or hydnoid fungus – underside of the fruiting body composed of spines or teeth
*Corticioid fungus – the underside of the fruiting body is usually smooth or with spines (vs. hydnoid fungi) but not poroid nor gilled; typically effused without caps
*Cantharelloid fungus – fruiting body with shallow fold-like gills running over most of the lower surface of the fruiting body and not much differentiation between the stalk and cap.
*Gasteromycete or &quot;gastroid fungus&quot; – fruiting body has a ball-like shape and in which the hymenophore has become entirely enclosed on the inside of the fruiting body.
*False truffle – like a gasteromycete, however, but with a hypogeous (underground) fruiting body.
*Secotioid fungus – like a gasteromycete, but with a stalk. Thought to be an evolutionarily intermediate stage between a gasteromycete and an agaric. 
*Agaric or gill fungi – fruiting body with caps, gills, and (usually) a stalk.
*Bolete – fleshy fruiting body with a cap, a stalk, and tubes on the underside. 

Basic divisions of Agaricomycotina were formerly based entirely upon the growth form of the mushroom. Molecular phylogenetic investigation (as well as supporting evidence from and chemotaxonomy) has since demonstrated that similar types of basidiomycete growth form are often examples of convergent evolution and do not always reflect a close relationship between different groups of fungi. For example, agarics have arisen independently in the Agaricales, the Boletales, the Russulales, and other groups, while secotioid fungi and false truffles have arisen independently many times just within the Agaricales.

<doc id="1088603" wikidata="Q7401029" url="?curid=1088603" title="Saint Bathans">
<text>St Bathans, formerly named Dunstan Creek, is a former gold and coal mining town in Central Otago, New Zealand. The settlement was a centre of the Otago gold rush, but mining has since long ceased. It is now largely a holiday retreat due to the preservation of many of its historic buildings.

St Bathans is well known for Blue Lake, a small man-made lake created by gold-sluicing that transformed the 120-metre high Kildare Hill into a 168-metre deep pit. After mining stopped in 1934, the hole accumulated water, which turned a distinctive blue hue due to minerals from the surrounding rocks. It is currently a camping spot, and swimming is allowed in the lake.

The town was named for the Scottish Borders village of Abbey St Bathans by early surveyor John Turnbull Thomson; the Scottish village was the birthplace of Thomson&#x27;s maternal grandfather. It is 40 kilometres northwest of Ranfurly and 60 kilometres northeast of Alexandra, near the Dunstan Creek, beneath the St Bathans Range and Dunstan mountains.

The area attracts many visitors intent on gold-prospecting.

==Vulcan Hotel==

The Vulcan Hotel (at ) is a restored public house located on the main street of St Bathans, and is the town&#x27;s main tourist attraction. Originally called the Ballarat Hotel, the building was originally constructed in 1882 of mud brick. The building is registered as a Category I historic place by Heritage New Zealand. The building is notable as possibly the country&#x27;s most famous haunted building. Room 1 of the hotel is reputedly home to the spirit of a young woman, thought by some to be a prostitute known &quot;the Rose&quot;, who was strangled to death in the hotel in the 1880s.

==Geology and palaeontology==

The town lends its name to the St Bathans fauna, a rich palaeontological section of the lower Bannockburn Formation of the Manuherikia Group, with an age range of 19–16 million years ago. The layer in which the fossils are found derives from littoral zone sediments deposited in a large shallow freshwater lake bordered by an extensive floodplains. The fossiliferous layer has been exposed at places along the Manuherikia River close to the town, and is the remnant of the prehistoric Lake Manuherikia.

===St Bathans mammal===

In 2006, scientists reported the finding of nontherian mammal fossils in the Manuherikia Group near St Bathans. Previously it had been thought that bats were the only terrestrial mammals native to New Zealand. Dubbed the SB mammal (for St Bathans), the scientists&#x27; analysis indicates that the creature has a lineage distinct from monotremes (egg-laying mammals), eutherians (placental mammals) and metatherians (marsupials).

===Other taxa===
The St Bathans formation also bears fossils of moa, mekosuchine crocodiles, turtles, skinks, tuatara, geckoes, at least eight taxa of waterfowl including the endemic &quot;Miotadorna&quot; and &quot;Manuherikia&quot;, a petrel, Accipitriformes, rails, a possible seagull, herons, a palaelodid flamingo, pigeons, parrots, a swift, an owlet-nightjar, songbirds, the enigmatic &quot;Aptornis&quot; and a primitive kiwi, &quot;Proapteryx&quot;.

<text>Blinking with Fists is the debut book of poetry by The Smashing Pumpkins and former Zwan frontman, Billy Corgan. The progress and writing of the poems was covered in Corgan&#x27;s blogs. The Volume of 57 poems was published by Faber and Faber in 2004 and received mixed reviews. Dwight Garner (critic) of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;at its best, &quot;Blinking With Fists&quot; is vivid and angular and not much worse than many first books of poems that arrive with heady praise from the poetry world&#x27;s burghers.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the effort a &quot;D,&quot; calling the poems &quot;both pretentious and confoundingly esoteric.&quot; The book peaked at #24 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

The jacket of the book was designed by Charlotte Strick and the artwork and author photograph are by Yelena Yemchuk, who was involved with artwork for The Smashing Pumpkins. Interior design is by Gretchen Achilles.

<text>Dunedin Railways (formerly the Taieri Gorge Railway) is the trading name of Dunedin Railways Limited, an operator of a railway line and tourist trains based at Dunedin Railway Station in the South Island of New Zealand. The company is a council-controlled trading organisation wholly owned by Dunedin City Council through its holding company Dunedin City Holdings Limited.

==History==
===Formation===

The Otago Excursion Train Trust was formed in 1978 to operate excursions on the Otago Central Railway line, running its first train in October 1979. The services grew in popularity and the Trust realised by the 1980s that it had great tourist potential. New carriages were acquired with the &quot;Taieri Gorge Limited&quot; launching in February 1987.

On 19 December 1989, the New Zealand Railways Corporation announced the closure of the Otago Central railway line beyond Taieri owing to a lack of freight traffic following the completion of the Clyde Dam. Dunedin City Council then stepped in, purchasing the line as far as Middlemarch and five locomotives, which were then leased by the Trust to run its trains. The Trust continued to operate the Taieri Gorge Limited, now with its own locomotives (DJ class locomotives withdrawn by NZR in the same year), but needed a further NZ$1 million to fund its operations. A community appeal in 1990 raised NZ$1.2 million. The line beyond Middlemarch on the Otago Central Branch was lifted during 1991, and the trackbed handed over to the Department of Conservation in 1993. It is now the Otago Central Rail Trail, a major cycling tourist attraction in the area.

===Local Authority Trading Enterprise===
On 8 March 1995, the Dunedin City Council (through its holding company Dunedin City Holdings Limited) and the Trust incorporated a new company, Taieri Gorge Railway Limited. Dunedin City Holdings was a majority shareholder (72.03%) and the Trust held the balance of the shares (27.97%). The company operated as a Council-controlled organisation (formerly known as a Local-authority trading enterprise) under Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2002. This was due to the need to raise more capital to finance the expansion of the Trusts operation. Dunedin City Council then sold the railway line to the new company, and the Trust sold its locomotives, carriages and other assets to the new company. The company is governed according to its constitution by a board of directors comprising six people. Two of these people were selected by Dunedin City Holdings Limited, two by the Otago Excursion Train Trust and two jointly by both shareholding parties. On 1 December 2017, the company changed its name to Dunedin Railways Limited.

=== Taieri Gorge Limited ===

The Taieri Gorge Limited is New Zealand&#x27;s longest tourist railway and stretches along the former Otago Central Railway from the 4 km peg on the Taieri Branch, 18 km west of Dunedin, to Middlemarch, a distance of . Between Dunedin and the start of the line, its trains operate on KiwiRail&#x27;s Main South Line via a running rights agreement.

The line travels along the banks of the Taieri River, through numerous tunnels and along the Taieri Gorge to the Strath Taieri. It crosses a dozen viaducts and passes through ten tunnels.

At Wingatui railway station, the original building and signal box from 1914 have been restored. After the line passes through the long Salisbury Tunnel, the longest on the line, it crosses Mullocky Gully over the long Wingatui Viaduct, the largest wrought iron structure in New Zealand since it was built in 1887. The 47 m tall viaduct&#x27;s riveted truss structure rests on seven concrete and masonry piers.

Shortly after the Wingatui Viaduct, the route emerges from Mullocky Gully to join Taieri Gorge, and from then on follows that gorge above Taieri River to just east of Pukerangi. On the way the line passes former stations Parera, Mount Allen, Little Mount Allen, and Christmas Creek, crossing two curved viaducts at the latter two locations. Hindon, still operating as a crossing station, is typically one of the stopping points on the trip. Just before the station, the railway tracks share a combined road-rail bridge with Hindon Road.

Another stopping point for photo opportunities is the Deep Stream viaduct. Here the line slowly starts to climb higher and out of the gorge, passing over the Flat Stream viaduct, and &quot;The Notches&quot;, a section of short bridges and cuttings through several rocky outcrops, on its way to Pukerangi. Between Pukerangi and Middlemarch, the railway only once more comes close to the Taieri River, where it crosses Sutton Creek over another combined road-rail bridge.

Dunedin Railways currently operates on a reduced schedule. The Inlander runs through the Taieri Gorge to Hindon, The Seasider runs up the coast through Waitati to Seacliff, and The Victorian is an all-day trip to the North Otago town of Oamaru. Special services also run, including the Christmas Inlander in December and the addition of Quiz Trains in 2023. 2024 saw the addition of The Stargazer, a trip to Hindon for an evening of star gazing hosted by the Dunedin Astronomical Society.

=== Seasider and Dunedin Silver Fern ===
Dunedin Railways also operates the Seasider tourist train along the coast to Waitati, north of Dunedin. Following the withdrawal of the Southerner by Tranz Scenic in 2002, it is the only passenger train on the Main South Line.

In 2012, Dunedin Railways leased one of the Silver Fern class railcars from KiwiRail for use on the same route as the Seasider.

===Rebranded Dunedin Railways===
On 23 October 2014, the Taieri Gorge Railway announced that it would be changing its name to Dunedin Railways. For 35 years, the Taieri Gorge Railway and the Otago Excursion Train Trust had taken tourists on scenic rail excursions up the Taieri Gorge to Middlemarch and more recently up the coast, north of Dunedin on the Seasider. The reason for the change was so that tourists can link the train trips to Dunedin and it makes it much clearer what the railway is. AO 77 was the first carriage to be repainted into their new blue livery with their name on the sides in October 2014. This was followed by A 3022 and AG 239. In September 2015, AL 1695 was repainted into their yellow version of livery.

===Mothballing===
On 20 April 2020, the company announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, it mothballed its track and equipment. The company said up to 80% of its revenue came from international tourists. The mothballing could affect up to 51 jobs.

===Reactivation and restructure===
Following the decision to mothball Dunedin Railways, the Otago Excursion Train Trust sold its shares in the company to the council in April 2020.

In May 2021, Dunedin City Council agreed to keep the Taieri Gorge line as far as Hindon in operation, as well as services on KiwiRail&#x27;s railway lines. In November 2021, the council agreed to extend support through to 2024. In 2023, the council decided to reactivate the Hindon-Middlemarch section as well.

== Financial performance ==
In the financial year to June 2017, Dunedin Railways had revenues of NZ$6.578m and expenses of NZ$6.387m, and turned a profit of NZ$137,000. Following the COVID-19 pandemic of 2021, Dunedin Railways was losing NZ$1.5 million per annum.

== Locomotives and railcars ==
The railway owns seven former New Zealand Railways DJ class locomotives, four of which are currently operational and certified for mainline operation. They are painted in a variant of the modified New Zealand Railways scheme carried by the class in the 1980s, where the low nose sides are painted blue instead of yellow and grey cab front. Two locomotives are in an operational condition, but are not currently certified for mainline use; a seventh, DJ3021 (ex-DJ 1202), is being stored, pending future restoration after it was purchased from its former home at Ranfurly station where it was a static display. An eighth, DJ3044 (DJ 1204) was acquired from Mainline Steam in 2012 as a source of spare parts and has been dismantled. Both were painted in the modified blue scheme and were purchased in a withdrawn condition.

TGR also operates one DE class locomotive, DE 504 (TMS DE1337). This locomotive was acquired from Otago Polytechnic (who had acquired it from New Zealand Railways Corporation) in the early 1990s and is not mainline certified, instead of being based at the TGR works depot at the 4 km peg. It previously carried a modified International Orange scheme but was repainted in 2006 to its original livery of Carnation Red with the addition of &quot;wasp stripes&quot; on the headstocks as it would have carried in the 1970s.

In 2013, Dunedin Railways leased Silver Fern railcar RM24 from KiwiRail and operated this on trips between Dunedin and Waitati. The railcar was returned to KiwiRail in 2019.

Dunedin Railways formerly operated a shunting locomotive, TR 111 at their Dunedin depot as their resident shunting locomotive. This locomotive was obtained by the Otago Excursion Train Trust in 2009 from enthusiast Reid McNaught, who had leased the locomotive to Dunedin Railways since 2006. It was sold to the Canterbury Railway Society in July 2015.

==Carriages==

===47&#x27; 6&quot; wooden body carriages===

All trains as of include some of Dunedin Railways five former New Zealand Railways 47&quot; 6&#x27; foot wooden-clad carriages. These cars are known as &quot;&quot;Scarrett&quot;&#x27;&quot; heritage carriages and were built between 1912 and 1923 with open platform ends, gangways and 37 seats. Dunedin Railways has started retiring these carriages largely to provide bogies for their 56-foot carriage stock, which did not have their own bogies when they were purchased. Two of the 47-foot cars have been sold, while two were scrapped circa 1978. One carriage, A 1254, is owned by the Ocean Beach Railway (OBR) and is leased to Dunedin Railways. This carriage will be returned to the OBR at the conclusion of its lease.

=== 50-foot carriages ===
Dunedin Railways has currently three steel-clad and one wood-clad NZR 50-foot carriages, formerly used on Dunedin suburban trains and express passenger trains. The steel-clads have 30-37 seats, enclosed vestibules and covered gangways and were built by New Zealand Railways Department in 1931–40. One of these is an AL class car-van with a small luggage compartment at one end while the other two are A class carriages. Steel-clad cars, A class 50159 and 50223 were sold to the Weka Pass Railway in 2008 and AL 50090 was sold to the Midland Rail Heritage Trust in 2013. The wood-clad carriages are A 1327, built in 1913, with open vestibules and non-covered gangways.

=== Jungle Gym panorama carriages===
Dunedin Railways has three all-steel air-conditioned panorama carriages with open platform ends and open gangways, known locally as &quot;Jungle Gyms&quot; due to the nature of their framework when under construction. These were designed and built by the OETT in 1987–92, with a &quot;very distinctive shape to fit the tunnels&quot;. Two of these carriages were built on Z class &quot;roadsider&quot; freight van underframes while the third was built on the underframe of guard&#x27;s van F 529.

=== 56-foot carriages ===
In September 2007, the Taieri Gorge Railway announced that it had purchased 12 NZR 56-foot carriages formerly used on the Wairarapa Connection. The first of these, A 2325, was prepared at a cost of $45,000 and was ready in September 2008. The company anticipated having three carriages in service by the end of 2008, and all 12 by 2013. The upgrade included new seating, carpets, toilets and external paint. The railway intends to refurbish three carriages each year. As of December 2015, only five out of the twelve carriages have been restored. Two of these carriages have since been disposed of.

In 2012, panoramic window car AO 77 was leased from KiwiRail. It has since been repainted in Dunedin Railways&#x27; blue livery and is now under their ownership. Privately owned A 3022 is leased from its owners since 2013. In 2018, Dunedin Railways purchased six big-window AO/ASO class carriages from KiwiRail. Two of these have since been converted to all-steel framing and reclassified as ADR.



==Freight haulage==
In the early 2000s, the TGR investigated the possibility of introducing log haulage between Mount Allan and Port Chalmers at the end of the Port Chalmers Branch. However, on 12 June 2007, it was announced that a cost difference of NZ$5 million existed between road and rail haulage in favour of road, and potential government subsidies were insufficient to close the gap. The announcement was met with disappointment by the Dunedin City Council, which favourably viewed the rail option as it was more environmentally friendly and would have reduced traffic congestion.

It has since been worked out that with extra damage caused by the logging trucks on the Mosgiel to Port Chalmers road that it would have been cheaper to perform the operation by rail, but despite pleas by the local council, Wenita, the relevant company, said it had invested too much in the road option to change its plans.

The route&#x27;s loading gauge restricts the maximum size of rolling stock that can operate on the railway; some freight wagons cannot use the line.

<text>Cet mac Mágach is a Connacht warrior in the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology. He had a rivalry with the Ulster warrior Conall Cernach.

In some myths, he is said to be the brother of Conall&#x27;s mother, making him Conall&#x27;s uncle.

At a feast at the house of Mac Dá Thó, a hospitaller of Leinster, the warriors of Connacht and Ulster competed for the champion&#x27;s portion by boasting of their deeds. Cet shamed all comers by reminding them how he had bested them in combat. However, just as Cet was about to carve, Conall Cernach arrived. Conall&#x27;s boasts topped even Cet&#x27;s. Cet admitted defeat, but claimed that if his brother Anlúan were present, his feats would top even Conall&#x27;s. Conall responded by tossing him Anlúan&#x27;s freshly severed head.

Cet killed Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster. He stole the calcified brain of Mesgegra, king of Leinster, which Conall Cernach had taken as a trophy of battle, and shot it from his sling, embedding it in Conchobar&#x27;s head. Conchobar&#x27;s doctors couldn&#x27;t remove it without killing him, so they sewed up the wound and told him he would survive as long as he didn&#x27;t get excited or over-exert himself. Seven reasonably peaceful years later Conchobar was told of the death of Christ. He flew into a rage, the brain burst from his head, and he died.

Cet made a raid on Ulster one winter&#x27;s day, killing twenty-seven men and taking their heads. It had snowed, so Conall Cernach was able to follow his trail. He caught up with him, but was reluctant to face him until his charioteer chided him for cowardice. They met at a ford, and Conall killed Cet in a ferocious combat that left Conall near to death himself.

<text>Ontario County was the name of two historic counties in the Canadian province of Ontario. Both counties were located in approximately the same area and existed on-and-off between 1792 and 1974. Their primary modern successor is the Regional Municipality of Durham, though certain parts of them were transferred to other surrounding regions.

==Ontario County (1792–1800)==

The original Ontario County, located in the Midland District, was constituted in 1792 as an electoral district for the new Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada:

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada dissolved the county, and redistributed its territory to the following electoral counties and townships, effective at the beginning of 1800:

==Ontario County (1852–1974)==

On January 1, 1852, the old County of York was divided into three counties (York, Ontario and Peel); however they remained united. On January 1, 1854, Ontario County separated and became its own independent county, with the support of Peter Perry of Whitby. The population in 1854 was 30,000 and the first County Warden was Thomas N. Gibbs.

It was replaced by the Regional Municipality of Durham effective January 1, 1974.

===Original townships===
* Brock, area Surveyed in 1817. Community centres: Cannington, Vroomanton, Pinedale, Sunderland, Wick.
* Mara, area . Surveyed in part in 1820; the survey was completed in 1836. The Township might have been named in honour of Gertrud Elisabeth Mara, or for the Spanish word for sea. Community centres were: Gamebridge, Brechin, Atherley, Udney and Rathburn.
* Pickering, area . Opened in 1792 and first called Edinburgh it was renamed after the English town in Yorkshire. Community centres: Pickering, Dunbarton, Green River, Balsam, Claremont, Brougham, Altona.
* Rama, area . Opened in 1820. Rama is the Spanish name for the branch of a tree. Surveyed in 1834 and 1855. The area was first settled by retired British officers, but they ran into difficulties with the Bank of Upper Canada. The Bank sold the land to the Indian Department and the Ojibwe First Nations at Orillia were removed to a village built for them in 1838. Community centres: Floral Park, Longford Mills, Cooper&#x27;s Falls, Washago.
* Reach area Opened in 1809 and named after the village in Bedfordshire, England. Community centres: Port Perry, Manchester, Saintfield, Utica.
* Scott area . Opened in 1820. Believed to be named after Thomas Scott, Chief Justice of Upper Canada from 1806 to 1816. Community centres: Zephyr, Sandford, Leaskdale, Udora.
* Thorah, area Opened in 1820 and named form the Hebrew word signifying the inspired Law, the Pentateuch. Community centres: Beaverton.
* Uxbridge, area Opened in 1798 and named after the English town. Early settlers included Pennsylvania Quakers. New Yorkers settled in 1806. Community Centres: Uxbridge, Goodwood.
* Whitby, Area . Opened in 1792 and named for an English seaport. Community centres: Oshawa, Whitby, Brooklin, Ashburn and Myrtle.

The Town of Oshawa was also located in the county.

In 1855 the Town of Whitby was incorporated in part of Whitby Township. Scugog Township was formed from a portion of Reach Township and Cartwright Township in adjoining Northumberland and Durham County in 1856. And in 1858, the Township of East Whitby was formed from the eastern portion of Whitby Township.

A number of villages were also incorporated as separate municipalities in the county after it was created: Port Perry in 1871, Uxbridge in 1872, Cannington in 1878 and Beaverton in 1884. In the 20th century, the wartime town of Ajax, located in Pickering Township, was incorporated as an improvement district in 1950. It became a town in 1955. The Village of Pickering was incorporated as a village in 1953.

On January 1, 1974, the portion of Ontario County south of the Trent–Severn Waterway and about half of adjacent Durham County were amalgamated as the Regional Municipality of Durham. The remaining portions of Durham County were transferred to other neighbouring counties, and the portion of Ontario County north of the Trent–Severn Waterway (Rama and Mara Townships) was transferred to Simcoe County. In addition, the part of Pickering Township west of the Rouge River (West Rouge and Port Union) was transferred to the Borough of Scarborough in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. At this time Ontario and Durham counties were dissolved.

Whitby served as the &quot;County Town&quot; or county seat and as such was the location for the county offices, courthouse and land registry office. It continues in this role for Durham Region today.

<text>Cethern mac Fintain is an Ulster warrior who aids Cúchulainn in the &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley), according to the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

As Cúchulainn lay wounded after his combat with Ferdiad, Cethern entered the fray on his chariot, stark naked and armed only with a silver spike. He killed many men, but was severely wounded.

Cúchulainn sent to the Connacht camp for doctors to tend to him. The first doctor told Cethern his wounds were fatal. Cethern punched his brains out the back of his head and asked for a second opinion. Forty-nine more doctors told him the same thing, and he killed all of them in turn, except one, who was only stunned. Finally Cúchulainn sent for Conchobar&#x27;s doctor, Fingín.

Fingín examined each of Cethern&#x27;s wounds and was able to tell how he received them and from whom. He gave him two options. He could save his life, but the treatment would take a whole year; or he could make him fit to fight now, in which case he would survive only three more days. Cethern chose the latter. Fingín had Cúchulainn make a bath of bone marrow, and had Cethern sleep in it. He replaced some of his ribs with chariot parts, and tied the frame of the chariot to his belly to keep his insides in. Cethern&#x27;s wife arrived with his weapons, and he went back into battle.

The doctor who had only been stunned managed to reach the Connacht camp to warn them, and they put Ailill&#x27;s crown on a standing stone as a decoy. Cethern put his sword and his fist through the stone. He killed men for a day and a night, until he was surrounded and died fighting.

Cethern was also said to be a mentor of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.

<doc id="1088616" wikidata="Q6838341" url="?curid=1088616" title="Mick Molloy">
<text>Michael Molloy (born 11 July 1966) is an Australian comedian, writer, producer, actor and television and radio presenter who has been active in radio, television, stand-up and film. He currently hosts &quot;The Front Bar&quot; on the Seven Network.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Molloy grew up in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) before moving to Melbourne in the 1980s. He attended The Peninsula School during his high school period and then studied performing arts at the University of Melbourne, where he wrote and performed in his first live act in 1987. It was there he met the Australian comedy troupe The D-Generation (the future cast of &quot;The Late Show&quot;) who later formed Working Dog Productions, and with whom Molloy would collaborate on several projects.

===Television===
Molloy worked with the D-Generation as a writer-performer on their 1988 Seven Network specials (he had auditioned for the D-Gen in 1986 but it was not until the troupe saw him in the 1987 Melbourne University revue, &quot;Laminex on the Rocks&quot;, that they signed him). He also worked as a writer on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC) &quot;The Gerry Connolly Show&quot; (1988), the Network Ten series &quot;The Comedy Company&quot; in its 1989 season and, while working on the (unscreened) pilots for &quot;The Late Show&quot;, for the Nine Network (1990). Molloy was a cast member of ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1992–1993) as a writer and performer. As well as pairing up with Tony Martin for each episode&#x27;s introduction and the &quot;Street Interviews&quot; segment, Molloy co-hosted the segments &quot;Muckrakers&quot; with Jason Stephens and &quot;Commercial Crimestoppers&quot; with Santo Cilauro. He played the thick-witted assistant of stuntman Rob Sitch in &quot;Shitscared&quot; and performed in many other sketches (providing the voices of Sergeant Olden in &quot;The Olden Days&quot; and Chief Chromedome in &quot;Bargearse&quot;). He also delivered a series of volatile rants in the &quot;Mick&#x27;s Serve&quot; segment of &quot;Late Show News&quot;.

Molloy landed his own late-night TV show, &quot;The Mick Molloy Show&quot;, which premiered on the Nine Network in 1999. Planned to run for twenty episodes, it was slated by the critics and cancelled after eight. His next involvement with television was the show &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, with Nicole Livingstone, on the Nine Network in 2006. He was involved in the 2006 Commonwealth Games coverage on the Nine Network as a commentator for the lawn bowls events.

In 2007, Molloy filmed a pilot of &quot;The Nation&quot;, a weekly late-night news-based comedy hour on the Nine Network. The show debuted on 5 June but struggled for ratings, attracting 575,000 viewers nationally for its fourth show. Originally it was on Tuesdays at 9:30 pm, but was moved to Wednesdays at 10:30 pm and ended in August 2007.

In 2008, it was announced that Molloy would replace Peter Helliar on the panel of Channel 10&#x27;s &quot;Before the Game&quot;, an AFL themed show, after Helliar had discontinued his position post-2007. On the show, his views as a keen supporter of the Richmond Football Club (Tigers) were often made clear. Molloy is one of the club&#x27;s more prominent supporters and as well as appearing on &quot;Before the Game&quot; he has appeared in club membership advertising campaigns. In June 2008, Molloy made comments on the show regarding Nicole Cornes, the wife of former Adelaide coach Graham Cornes, in which he suggested she had slept with footballer Stuart Dew. Nicole Cornes sued the Ten Network for defamation and was awarded A$85,000 in July 2011. Molloy remained with &quot;Before the Game&quot; until it was axed at the end of the 2013 AFL season.

In 2009, Molloy starred in the sitcom &quot;The Jesters&quot; which aired on Movie Extra on Foxtel. He played a veteran comic Dave Davies who has become the manager of a group of young, rookie comedians and who has to cope with the behind-the-scenes antics of producing a comedy sketch show. A second series aired in 2011.

In February 2010, it was announced that Molloy and Eddie McGuire would be investigated by the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board following complaints that their on-air coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics men&#x27;s figure skating contained homophobic remarks. The complaint was later withdrawn after the complainant met with McGuire.

In February 2014, it was announced by the Seven Network that Molloy would be joining its one-hour AFL match preview show on Saturday nights during the football season. In 2015, Molloy was announced as a host of an online show called &quot;Friday Front Bar&quot; (subsequently renamed to &quot;The Front Bar&quot;). In 2016, Channel 7 picked up the show.

===Radio===
After writing and performing on &quot;The D-Generation Breakfast Show&quot; on Triple M Melbourne, from 1990 to 1992, Molloy teamed up with Tony Martin for Triple M&#x27;s &quot;Bulltwang&quot; (1990)

After &quot;The Late Show&quot; finished, Molloy developed, again with Martin, the successful Austereo radio programme, &quot;Martin/Molloy&quot; (1995–98), which produced three ARIA award-winning compilation albums, &quot;The Brown Album&quot; (1995), &quot;Poop Chute&quot; (1996) and &quot;Eat Your Peas&quot; (1998). Molloy occasionally appeared with his former D-Generation cohorts on Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;The Panel&quot; (1998–2004).

Molloy hosted another radio show, &quot;Tough Love with Mick Molloy&quot; (2004–06) on Triple M alongside Robyn Butler and Richard Molloy.

In 2011, Molloy returned to radio and to Triple M Melbourne, as a permanent member of &quot;The Hot Breakfast&quot;.
He is also appearing daily at 6:50am on Triple M Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;The Grill Team&quot;.

In July 2017, Triple M announced that Molloy would host a new national drive show with Jane Kennedy across the Triple M network in 2018. As a result, he transitioned away from &quot;The Hot Breakfast&quot; and was replaced by Wil Anderson. Molloy finished on &quot;The Hot Breakfast&quot; on 6 October 2017 and debuted on the new show, &quot;Kennedy Molloy&quot;, the following week.

===Film===
Following the cancellation of &quot;The Mick Molloy Show&quot;, Molloy returned with a video release, entitled &quot;Shonky Golf with Mick Molloy&quot;, and he directed the feature-length documentary &quot;Tackle Happy&quot; (2000). He played Kim&#x27;s dad Gary Poole on &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; (2003–04) and co-starred, with David Wenham, in two &quot;Murray Whelan&quot; telemovies, &quot;Stiff&quot; and &quot;The Brush-Off&quot; (both 2004).

He has starred in three movies, &quot;Crackerjack&quot; (2002) (which he also co-wrote, receiving an AFI nomination), Tony Martin&#x27;s &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; (2003), and &quot;BoyTown&quot; (2006), which, like &quot;Crackerjack&quot;, he co-wrote with his brother Richard Molloy. During production of the DVD-release for &quot;Boytown&quot; in 2007, Molloy and his long-time collaborator Tony Martin had a dispute over the proposed extra content for the DVD and the two have not worked together since. In the 2006 Australian feature film &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Molloy played Brown; it was the second time he has appeared in a production of Macbeth.

He also had a role in the 2019 biographical film based on Michelle Payne&#x27;s life, &quot;Ride Like a Girl&quot;.

==Personal life==
Molloy was the long-term partner of Australian actress Sophie Lee in the 1990s. (Lee regularly appeared on Molloy&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show, as well as playing Tracey Kerrigan in the film &quot;The Castle&quot;, which was made by Molloy&#x27;s former D-Gen colleague Rob Sitch).

Molloy is also a famous supporter of the Richmond Football Club. His affinity for the Tigers has been a topic on &quot;The Front Bar&quot;, and he has also turned on the yellow lights at the Richmond Town Hall to celebrate Richmond&#x27;s 2017 preliminary final victory over Greater Western Sydney and had a street mural outside of Hector&#x27;s Deli in Richmond depicting him wearing a Richmond guernsey.

In April 2012, at the 54th Logie Awards, Molloy delivered an onstage tribute to friend and colleague Bill Hunter, who died in 2011.

On &quot;The Hot Breakfast&quot; on 8 June 2012, Molloy announced that his partner was pregnant with twin boys. On 11 July he announced that they had been born the previous day, a month ahead of schedule.

Molloy has used his resemblance to Saddam Hussein to create jokes.

<text>Army One is the callsign of any United States Army aircraft carrying the president of the United States. An Army aircraft carrying the vice president is designated Army Two.

From 1957 until 1976, the callsign was usually used for an Army helicopter transporting the president. Prior to 1976, responsibility for helicopter transportation of the president was divided between the Army and the U.S. Marine Corps, under the call sign Marine One, until the Marine Corps was given the sole responsibility of transporting the president by helicopter.
The best known helicopters that used the Army One callsign were Sea King VH-3A helicopters that were part of the presidential fleet from 1961 to 1976. During its presidential service, the helicopter was known either as Army One or Marine One, depending on whether Army or Marine pilots were operating the craft. The helicopter, with seats for sixteen, has a seat reserved for the president and the first lady, and single, smaller seats for the two Secret Service agents who always flew with the presidential party.

<text>Australian industrial relations law maintains a system of compulsory arbitration in the settlement of industrial disputes between employers, employees, and their respective registered industrial associations. Associations of employers or employees must be &quot;registered&quot; by the relevant Industrial Relations Commission in order to have disputes heard before that commission. However, in the Fair Work Commission individuals may appoint an unregistered/deregistered industrial organisation to represent them in any disputes.

For a variety of reasons, some industrial associations are not registered under their commission.
They may not meet the requirements for registration, may have had their registration revoked, or may have elected not to register.

The following are examples of &quot;deregistered or unregistered Australian unions&quot; that organisations of employee associations or groups which are not registered under State or Federal law as registered employee groups may have occurred due to a range of issues:

*Builders Labourers Federation
*Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union
* Health Workers Union (Queensland)
*Industrial Workers of the World
* National Jet Systems Pilots Group
* Queensland Power Workers&#x27; Association (now defunct) 
* Queensland Prison Officers Association] (QPOA) &quot;Prison Officers working for Prison Officers&quot;
*Retail and Fast Food Workers Union
*Shearers and Rural Workers&#x27; Union
*Unite Union

<text>Xinhua Daily () was the first newspaper published in the People&#x27;s Republic of China by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is owned by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CCP.

==History==
The &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; was founded in Hankou on 11 January, 1938. After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the paper continued to publish in Chongqing. The &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; was the only newspaper published by the CCP during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was published by the party in order to consolidate public sentiment against the Japanese. As a propaganda instrument, the paper faced competition from the &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot;, which began publishing on 16 May 1941 under the direct control of Mao Zedong. The &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot; was created as part of Mao&#x27;s larger strategy to move the CCP&#x27;s propaganda arm under his direct control - the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; had moved to Chongqing and was not controlled by Mao. The Chongqing edition of the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; was controlled directly by Zhou Enlai until February 1947.

In March 2018, &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; won the Third National Top 100 Newspapers in China. In June 2022, Jiangsu launched an international communication center called JiangsuNow, which is run by &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot;.

=== Political positions ===
In the relatively liberal media environment of war-time Chongqing, the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; competed with other publications of different affiliations, as the Kuomintang was not able to exert ironclad control over speech. However hardline supporters of the Kuomintang made serious attempts to stifle the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; as a newspaper of the CCP, such as refusing to grant it legal rights for paper distribution, exerting control over post offices and newspaper vendors, and by implementing a newspaper censorship system that inspected all content published by the paper. 

Other newspapers publishing in Chongqing included the &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; (then an independent newspaper also known as &quot;L&#x27;Impartial&quot;) and a Kuomintang newspaper, the &quot;Zhongyang Ribao&quot; &quot;(Central Daily News)&quot;, along with many other smaller papers. Along with &quot;L&#x27;Impartial&quot;, the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; published vernacular poetry, compared to the strictly classical poetry published by &quot;Central Daily News&quot;. Written vernacular Chinese () had been associated with the progressive movement since the New Culture Movement in 1917, whereas the classical language was associated with conservatism. &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; published a number of poems by the poet Liu Yazi, many of which commented on the arrival of Mao in Chongqing in 1945 for peace talks with Chiang Kai-shek. Mao was then believed to be a proponent of multiparty democracy that &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; championed regularly. 

On February 28, 1947, the publication of the &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; was forbidden by the Kuomintang. Later, on April 23, 1949, &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; began publication with official support.
== Coverage ==
The &quot;Xinhua Daily&quot; was formed during the latter part of the Nanjing Massacre and began publishing news reports of the Japanese Army&#x27;s atrocities after January 1938, particularly after Western reporting on the topic dwindled in February 1938.

<text>Durham County (area ) is an historic county in Ontario, Canada. It was named for the English County Durham and city of Durham. It was created in 1792 but was later merged Northumberland County to form the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham. In 1974, the two counties were split and reorganized, with the former portions of Durham County reorganized into the Regional Municipality of Durham.

== History ==
Durham County was created in 1792 by a proclamation of Lieutenant Governor Simcoe. The original boundaries were as follows:

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada passed a statute defining the boundaries of the counties. Durham was then defined to include:

In 1834, the townships of Verulam, Fenelon and Eldon were added to Durham County.

=== Mergers and dissolution ===

Durham was united administratively with Northumberland County as the United Counties of Northumberland and Durham from 1850 until Durham County was dissolved on January 1, 1974.

Effective January 1, 1974, about half of Durham County was merged with Ontario County to create the Regional Municipality of Durham. The township of Manvers was transferred to Victoria County, which is now the city of Kawartha Lakes, Cavan was transferred to Peterborough County, where it is now part of Cavan-Monaghan, and Hope was transferred to Northumberland County, where it is now part of the town of Port Hope.

The townships of Darlington and Clarke were amalgamated with the Town of Bowmanville and the Village of Newcastle as the Town of Newcastle, and the township of Cartwright was combined with the Ontario County townships of Scugog and Reach to create a new Township of Scugog. In 1993, Newcastle was renamed Clarington.

==Historic townships==

The county was originally composed of the townships of Cartwright, Manvers, Cavan, Darlington, Clarke and Hope, and portions of what is now Peterborough County, created in 1838.
*Cartwright – Area . Located in the northwest portion of Durham County, touching Lake Scugog. The Township was opened in 1816. The name is in honour of Richard Cartwright. Mostly settled between 1850 and 1858 by Irish immigrants. Community centres: Purple Hill, Caesarea, Scugog. This Township is now in Scugog Township
*Cavan – Area 62,296 acres. Settled in 1816. Community centres : Millbrook, Cavan and Carmel. This Township is now in Cavan-Monaghan Township in Peterborough County
*Clarke - Area, . Was opened in 1792 and named in honour of General Alured Clarke. Community centres: Newcastle, Newtonville, Crooked Creek, Morgan&#x27;s Corners, Orono, Kendall, Leskard. This Township is now in Clarington Municipality
*Darlington – Area, . It was opened in 1792 and named after the ancient English town. The first European settlers arrived from the United States in 1794. Community centres, Bowmanville, Enniskillen, Tyrone, Courtice. (the settlement was mostly Irish). This Township is now in Clarington Municipality.
*Hope – Area, . First settlement was in the town of Port Hope. The Township as opened in 1792 and named in honour Colonel Henry Hope, a member of the Legislative Council of Canada. The Township is now the Town of Port Hope in Northumberland County
*Manvers – Area . Opened in 1816. Named in honour of Charles Pierrepont, 1st Earl Manvers. Community centres: Pontypool, Manvers Station, Janetville, Yelverton, Bethany, Franklin, Brunswick, Burton, Ballyduff, Lotus, Fleetwood, Lifford. Now in the City of Kawartha Lakes.

<doc id="1088625" wikidata="Q5408221" url="?curid=1088625" title="Eugenics Record Office">
<text>The Eugenics Record Office (ERO), located in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States, was a research institute that gathered biological and social information about the American population, serving as a center for eugenics and human heredity research from 1910 to 1939. It was established by the Carnegie Institution of Washington&#x27;s Station for Experimental Evolution, and subsequently administered by its Department of Genetics.

Both its founder, Charles Benedict Davenport, and its director, Harry H. Laughlin, were major contributors to the field of eugenics in the United States. Its mission was to collect substantial information on the ancestry of the American population, to produce propaganda that was made to fuel the eugenics movement, and to promote the idea of race-betterment.

==History==
The eugenics movement was popular and viewed as progressive in the early-twentieth-century United States. Charles Davenport was one of the leaders of this campaign and avidly believed that it was necessary to apply Mendelian Genetics principles to humans. Davenport&#x27;s wife, Gertrude Davenport, was also an important figure in this movement and the establishment of the ERO. Gertrude Davenport was an embryologist and a geneticist who wrote papers with her husband supporting the idea that Mendelian genetics theories applied to humans.

Supported by the argument that the eugenics office would collect information for human genetics research, Davenport convinced the Carnegie Institute to establish the ERO. He was well connected to wealthy people during the time and he lobbied them to finance his vision of the ERO. The ERO was financed primarily by Mary Harriman (widow of railroad baron E. H. Harriman), the Rockefeller Foundation, and then the Carnegie Institution until 1939. In 1935, the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review the ERO&#x27;s work, and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all work. In 1939 the Carnegie Institution&#x27;s new president, Vannevar Bush, forced Laughlin&#x27;s retirement and withdrew funding for the ERO entirely, leading to its closure at the end of that year.

Superintendent Harry H. Laughlin, formerly a school superintendent in Iowa, held a position akin to that of an assistant director of the ERO. Charles Davenport appointed Laughlin as a head of the ERO due to Laughlin&#x27;s extensive knowledge about breeding and the implementation of this knowledge in humans. Under the direction of Laughlin, the ERO advocated laws that led to the forced sterilization of many Americans it categorized as &#x27;socially inadequate&#x27;.

The endeavors of the Eugenics Record Office were facilitated by the work of various committees. The Committee on Inheritance of Mental Traits included among its members Robert M. Yerkes and Edward L. Thorndike. The Committee on Heredity of Deafmutism included Alexander Graham Bell. Harry H. Laughlin was on the Committee on Sterilization, and the Committee on the Heredity of the Feeble Minded included, among others, Henry Herbert Goddard. Other prominent board members included scientists like Irving Fisher, William E. Castle, and Adolf Meyer.

In the 1920s, the ERO merged with the Station for Experimental Evolution and adopted the name of the Department of Genetics of the Carnegie Institute.

Eventually, the ERO closed in December 1939 in part due to the disapproval it received. The information that had been collected by the ERO was distributed amongst other genetic research based organizations and collections services.

The ERO&#x27;s reports, articles, charts, and pedigrees were considered scientific facts in their day, but have since been discredited. In 1944, its records were transferred to the Charles Fremont Dight Institute for the Promotion of Human Genetics at the University of Minnesota. When the Dight Institute closed in 1991, the genealogical material was filmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah and given to the Center for Human Genetics. The non-genealogical material was not filmed and was given to the American Philosophical Society Library. The American Philosophical Society has a copy of the microfilm as well. Today, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory maintains the full historical records, communications and artifacts of the ERO for historical, teaching and research purposes. The documents are housed in a campus archive and can be accessed online and in a series of multimedia websites.

==Methods==
The ERO collected research mostly through questionnaires. These questionnaires asked questions which described the characteristics of individual people and their families. These characteristics ranged from physical to temperamental properties. Many of these questionnaires were collected by field workers, usually educated women (who had few other jobs open to them), who would go door-to-door asking people to fill out this information. Many of these women had bachelor&#x27;s degrees in biology, and graduate school degrees were not uncommon. Additionally, the ERO had other methods of collecting these questionnaires such as sending them through the mail, and promoting them as methods for families to learn about their genetic lineage and family history.

The research collected by these field workers provided much of the information which facilitated the passage of several laws during the 1920s.

The ERO disseminated its information and its message via a variety of outlets. These included a journal called &quot;Eugenical News&quot;, posters with propaganda full messages about intelligent breeding, and pamphlets with information on the movement.

==Controversy==
Eugenics was and continues to be a controversial issue due to the pressure radical eugenicists put on the government to pass legislation that would restrict the liberties of the people who had traits that could be considered undesirable. Specifically, the ERO dedicated its resources to the restriction of immigrants and the forced sterilization of individuals deemed to have undesirable characteristics. They promoted their ideas through the distribution of propaganda that came in the form of images and information packets.

Something else that caused tension within and surrounding the ERO was Harry H. Laughlin&#x27;s radical policy suggestions. He was known for presenting fraudulent evidence to support policies of forced sterilization and was known for dogmatism. For instance, after being appointed to House committee for immigration, Harry H. Laughlin attempted to convince the committee that there were lower quality genes coming from southern and eastern parts of Europe. Consequently, the Johnson-Reed Act was passed in 1924 which prevented immigration from these areas. Harry Laughlin also advocated for compulsory sterilization on the state level. Over 35 states approved of these laws and numerous people were sterilized before the laws were repealed. Furthermore, the rise of Nazism in the 1930s and their use of and belief in eugenics led to opposition to the American program. The ERO finally being closed in 1939. Harry Laughlin&#x27;s policies were used in Germany where forced sterilization laws were passed. The result of these laws led to the sterilization of 400,000 individuals. Adolf Hitler also referred to American eugenics in his memoir, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. He claimed non-Aryan races to be subordinate and compulsory sterilization was justified in his view as a result.

Many government officials who were proponents of the ERO sought to implement forced sterilization laws. For example, Menendez Ramos, governor of Puerto Rico in the 1930s, established sterilization laws for Puerto Rican women. The intent was to battle generational poverty and increase economic utility among Puerto Ricans. Some historians say these laws were implemented in order to supposedly prevent the gene pool from being pervaded by Latino blood. In addition, in 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court claimed that sterilizing disabled citizens does not violate the Constitution. While these laws were ultimately repealed, a large majority of individuals had been already sterilized. Moreover, during the eugenics era, California lawmakers forcibly sterilized thousands of individuals in mental health facilities. The goal was to prevent the spread of mental illness in the following generations. Some children were allegedly denied healthcare unless their mothers were forcibly sterilized as well.

Many academics criticized the ERO. Herbert Spencer Jennings from Johns Hopkins University criticized Laughlin&#x27;s data which was used to justify restrictions on immigration. Other critics challenged the claims of eugenicists that there was a genetic influence from certain groups of people. For example, anthropologist Franz Boas from Columbia University claimed that Laughlin used racism masquerading as science.

Many scholars criticized how data was obtained and further used to justify the claims from the Eugenics Record Office. Major criticism came from the Galton Laboratory. Critics mentioned data obtained by eugenicists lacked an approach free from bias. They also claimed the data did not match Mendelian genetics. For instance, one main critique was the labeling of heterozygotes. Heterozygotes were sometimes labeled intermediate, while other times heterozygotes were labeled normal. According to the Galton Laboratory, the inconsistency in data showed the carelessness of their approach. Furthermore, a major critic of eugenics, A. M. Carr-Saunders of Britain, mentioned eugenicists were incapable of providing a distinction between biological heredity and the environment. He claimed social factors were largely dismissed by eugenicists.

Economist Joseph M. Gillman criticized the statistical analysis and research methodology of the ERO&#x27;s work, arguing that there were rudimentary statistics errors, as well as selection bias. For instance, Harry H. Laughlin asserted that various forms of &quot;degeneracy&quot; were innate to certain racial groups of recent immigrants by looking at populations in asylums and homes for the disabled. However, he failed to account for the fact that racial groups of older immigrant communities were more likely to take care of their disabled at home rather than place them in institutions, which was not the case for smaller recent immigrant groups who may not have family in the country to take care of them. Gillman wrote that the errors were so rudimentary that,what prompted both these gentlemen to commit these errors was apparently their intense desire, of one to associate with, and of the other to dissociate from race the incidence of the various social inadequacies. Facts were therefore selected in such a manner and the methods of interpretation were so chosen as to yield the desired support for their preconceived conclusions.Although the ERO and eugenics movement was prominent in the early to mid twentieth century, many of the initial philosophies remained. In a 1976 investigation, the Government Accountability Office found that over 25 percent of Native Americans were forcibly sterilized in the early 1970s. Additionally, in China, many Chinese geneticists sought to improve population quality. Beginning in the 1990s, some Chinese government officials sought to eliminate those with opposing moral values which tend to be influenced by the Buddhist and Taoist religions.

<doc id="1088632" wikidata="Q15371504" url="?curid=1088632" title="Platonia">
<text>Platonia insignis, the sole species of the genus Platonia, is a tree of the family Clusiaceae native to South America in the humid forests of Brazil, Paraguay, parts of Colombia and northeast to Guyana; especially in Amazon Rainforest. Common names include bacuri (and numerous variant spellings thereof; bacurí, bacury, bakuri, pacuri, pakuri, pakouri, packoeri, pakoeri), maniballi, naranjillo and bacurizeiro.

There was a degree of nomenclatural confusion, caused by &quot;Moronobea esculenta&quot;. If that were validly published for this species the current name would be &quot;Platonia esculenta&quot;. It was established that &quot;Moronobea esculenta&quot; is not a formal name (not &quot;validly published&quot;), so the name remains &quot;Platonia insignis&quot;.

&quot;Platonia&quot; is related to &quot;Montrouziera&quot; from New Caledonia.

==Description==
&quot;Platonia insignis&quot; is a dry-season deciduous tree, reaching 25–40 m high. It has a pyramidal crown and copious yellow latex in the bark. The leaves are opposite, simple oblong to elliptic, 8–15 cm long, and glossy dark green, with wavy margins and a leathery texture.

The flowers are 5–7 cm long and pink in color, with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is round to oval and 7–14 cm long, with a thick, yellow skin. It resembles a papaya. The rind exudes a yellow latex when pressed. The sticky white pulp is fragrant, with a taste that is both sweet and sour. There are 3 to 5 seeds.

The white-bellied parrot (&quot;Pionites leucogaster&quot;) is a pollinator of the plant, making it ornithophilous.

==Cultivation and uses==

The bacuri is grown for its fruit, which is made into various condiments and beverages. It contains high levels of phosphorus, iron, and vitamin C. The oily brown seeds are used as a home remedy to treat skin conditions. Its yellowish wood is frequently used as timber.

==Oil and butter==

The grease of the bacuri oil has a high absorption rate, due to its high level of tripalmitin (50% to 55%), which penetrates the skin quickly. The high amount of fatty palmitoleic acid (5%), compared to other oils (less than or equal to 0.5 to 1.5%), makes the bacuri oil useful as an emollient and moisturizing agent.

Physico-chemical data

==Chemistry==
&quot;Platonia&quot; is a natural source of trioxygenated xanthones. The latex contains resinotol.

<doc id="1088639" wikidata="Q1888364" url="?curid=1088639" title="The Battle of Olympus">
<text>The Battle of Olympus is a 1988 action role-playing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in 1990, and released in Europe in 1991. A port for the Game Boy was released.

== Plot ==
&quot;The Battle of Olympus&quot; takes place in ancient Greece which is being terrorized by Hades, the dark ruler of the underworld.

Helene, the lover of Orpheus, is kidnapped by Hades. A top-down map of Greece shows various dungeons and ancient Greek city-states for the player to visit on their journey. Swords, shields, and crystals help to provide offensive power and defensive strength for the player. Three fragments of love are there to remind Orpheus of his affection for Helene. Hades rules his dominion in Tartarus, where his strongest minions live alongside him.

During his adventure, Orpheus needs to meet the Greek gods and gain their favor, starting with Zeus, the leader of the Olympian gods, who encourages the other gods to grant Orpheus powers. These powers are in the form of a weapon, a shield, and other special equipment, among them a harp, which summons Pegasus to carry Orpheus to far locations. As the game progresses, players are exposed to various forms of upgraded weaponry. The player starts off with a basic wooden club. The player later obtains items such as the Staff of Fennel (also known as a thyrsus, which is able to project a fireball), Nymph&#x27;s Sword, and the Divine Sword (able to project a lightning bolt).

The game features encounters with mythological creatures such as the Taurus, Lamia, cyclops, centaur, Talos, Minotaur, Graeae, Cerberus, Stymphalian birds, Nemean lion, and also a Siren. Players must fight their way deep into the underworld, fight and defeat Hades, and save Helene. Several items depicted in the Greek mythology are acquired, such as the Harp of Apollo, the Sword of Hephaestus, the Staff of Prometheus, and the Sandals of Hermes.

==Gameplay==

Primarily a sidescroller with some light platforming, the player is a hero with a sword and shield, while just a handful of secondary items come along later in the game, mostly for the purpose of advancement as the protagonist move to new areas. He can find upgrades to maximize health, protection, and speed. The biggest differences in combat from Zelda II are the lack of the downward stab in midair, and the lack of the sword beam at full health. However, &quot;The Battle of Olympus&quot; does have a sword later in the game that can shoot beams, but doing so damages the health bar if a certain item is not found first.

&quot;The Battle of Olympus&quot; is somewhat non-linear and there are some optional side quests that can make the game easier in the long run, leading to a secret item or power-up from one of the gods.

The final battle brings to the Temple of Hades in fight with the ruler of the underworld in a two-stage event. The first is a blind fight against a shadow reflection, and then the final form is of Hades himself.

== Development ==
&quot;The Battle of Olympus&quot; was developed by Infinity, and was the first game from the company. The development team for the game was quite small, with only three members. Yukio Horimoto served as designer and programmer. Kazuo Sawa was the composer, and Reiko Oshida, Horimoto&#x27;s future wife, did story and graphics.

Designer Hoshimoto drew inspiration from &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; for gameplay. Similarities include a final confrontation with a shadow, similar character abilities, and the general appearance of the game. It was one of several NES games inspired by &quot;Zelda II&quot;, which also include &quot;Moon Crystal&quot;.

==Release==
It was published by Imagineer as &quot;Olympus no Tatakai&quot; and released in Japan on March 28, 1988. In North America, it was published by Broderbund and released in January 1990. In Europe, it was published by Nintendo and released in 1991.

The game was ported to the Game Boy by Canadian developer Radical Entertainment in 1993 and published by Imagineer for the European market only.

==Reception==
Japanese game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40. Reviewers noted similarities between the game and to the earlier game, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;.

<doc id="1088647" wikidata="Q8055421" url="?curid=1088647" title="York County, Ontario">
<text>York County is a historic county in Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Canadian province of Ontario. It was organized by the Upper Canada administration from the lands of the Toronto Purchase and others.

Created in 1792, at its largest size, it encompassed the area that presently comprises the City of Toronto, the regional municipalities of Halton, Peel, and York as well as portions of Regional Municipality of Durham and the City of Hamilton. However by 1851, York County only consisted of the areas presently comprising Toronto and Regional Municipality of York. In 1953, York County was split again, with the area south of Steeles Avenue forming the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.

York County was formally dissolved in 1971, with its remaining municipalities reorganized as the Regional Municipality of York.

==History==
York County was created on 16 June 1792 and was part of the jurisdiction of the Home District of Upper Canada. It originally comprised all of what is now the City of Toronto, the regional municipalities of Halton, Peel, and York as well as portions of the Regional Municipality of Durham, and the City of Hamilton. The town of York, later incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834, served as the initial seat for the county. Once Toronto was incorporated, it was severed from York County, although county offices remained located in Toronto.

In 1816, Wentworth and Halton counties were created, with portions of York County transferred to the new counties. In 1851, the western portions of York County were separated to form Peel County. In the same year, the eastern riding of York County was separated from York to form Ontario County.

In April 1953, the &quot;Metropolitan Toronto Act&quot; was passed in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. This resulted in municipalities south of Steeles Avenue being severed from York County to form the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, and the county offices for York County were moved from Toronto to Newmarket. The Act went into effect on 1 January 1954.

At a meeting in Richmond Hill on 6 May 1970, officials representing the municipalities of York County approved plans for the creation of a regional government entity to replace York County. In 1971, the remaining portion of York County was dissolved by restructuring it into the new Regional Municipality of York.

===Historic municipalities===
The following table is a list of historic municipalities that were at one point situated within York County.
==Governance==
The seat of government for York County was situated in Toronto (named York prior to 1834) from 1792 to 1953. After the creation of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, the seat of government for York County was moved to Newmarket.

===County offices===
From the 19th century to 1900, the offices of York County were held in various court houses. York County offices were first held at the First York County Courthouse on Front Street and Parliament Street from 1800 to 1813. The First York County Courthouse also housed the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada.)After the Battle of York, the county officials and legislative assembly met at the home of Major Alexander Montgomery Jr., located on north side of Richmond Street between Yonge and Victoria Streets (now Confederation Life Building). From 1824 to 1845, the county&#x27;s offices were located at the Second York County Courthouse on Church Street and King Street. From 1852 to 1900, the county offices were located at the Adelaide Court House.

From 1900 to 1953, the municipal government of Toronto shared its office space with York County at Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall.

After the southern portion of York County was severed to form Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, the county&#x27;s offices were relocated to the Old Newmarket Town Hall and Courthouse. In 1957, the York County Administrative Offices was also opened at 62 Bayview Parkway.

===Representation in colonial legislatures===
====Upper Canada====
York County was represented in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada by several ridings, initially grouped with neighbouring counties, then for the town of York (York, Upper Canada) and rural parts or York County:

====Province of Canada====
York was represented in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1867 with rural and town (city after 1834) ridings:

Most members were residents in Toronto and did not necessary represent a specific geographical area of York County.

<doc id="1088648" wikidata="Q1424550" url="?curid=1088648" title="Lake Ruataniwha">
<text>Lake Ruataniwha is an artificial lake in the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island of New Zealand. It was formed in 1977–1981 as part of the Waitaki hydroelectric project. It lies on the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago provinces, with the town of Twizel two kilometres to the north.

The lake takes its name from the Ruataniwha Station, a large sheep-station in the area, part of which the NZ Electricity Department purchased as the site for the township of Twizel (founded in 1968). Ruataniwha was a Māori chief who drowned when the canoe Arai-te-uru sank near Moeraki in the 12th century CE.

==Features==

The lake is approximately 4.5 km in length and covers 3.4 square km.

It was formed by the New Zealand Ministry of Works as part of the Upper Waitaki Power Project between 1977 and 1981 in a gorge created by the Ōhau River. The gorge was blocked by the building of the Ruataniwha Dam whose crest carries State Highway 8 between Twizel and Omarama.

Lake Ruataniwha is fed by the output from the Ōhau A power station and also by an overflow discharge from Lake Ōhau down the normally dry bed of the Ōhau River.

Ruataniwha discharges through a natural gap in the dam into a canal which feeds the Ōhau B power station. Immediately downstream is a connection to Wairepo Arm, a small lake. Connected to the Wairepo Arm by way of a culvert under State Highway 8 is Kellands Pond, whose 22 hectare area occupies further gravel pits.
There is a spillway (Gate 22) built into the dam which contains 3 gates with a total discharge capacity of 4,900 cubic metres per second which flows into the normally dry bed of the Ōhau River.

The lake functions as a surge reservoir for the power scheme. If, during excessive inflows into Lake Ōhau which Ōhau A is unable to pass or, when there has been a failure of the Ōhau canal, Lake Ōhau can overflow a weir into the normally dry bed of the upper reaches of the Ōhau River and thus into Lake Ruataniwha. Also, if water cannot pass down the canal to Ōhau B then the excess inflows into the lake can be diverted by the spillway down the bed of the lower reaches of the Ōhau River to Lake Benmore. While limited the storage capacity of the lake also ensures that the flows through Ōhau A do not have to be exactly matched to those through Ōhau B and Ōhau C.

==Construction==

Before construction of the dam could start the Ōhau River was diverted by cutting a channel through a low, rocky extension of the Benmore Range and building three diversion gates there which consumed 200,000 cubic metres of concrete. The Ōhau River was diverted in August 1980 so that water passed through Ōhau A and then back down the river bed. Later that year, downstream of Ōhau A, the river was again diverted, this time away from its natural channel and through the completed gates. An earth dam with gravel shoulders was then built on its upstream and downstream sides. The main dam, which blocks the original river channel, is 240 metres long while an adjoining wing dam is 480 metres.
When the dam was completed the diversion gates were closed which, beginning in March 1982, impounded the water behind the dam up to and over a temporary weir which had been built downstream of Ōhau A. In 1984 the lake was temporarily lowered by 3 metres while this weir was removed to improve the performance of the Ōhau A power station. The diversion gates now function as spillway gates to allow excess water to pass safely through the dam.
The lake was officially opened on Saturday 24 April 1982. There was a weekend event which attracted 7000 spectators with the rowing course hosting a regatta attended by 188 crews and representing 80 South Island rowing clubs.

==Recreation==
The lake was developed by the Ministry of Works into a major recreational resource for the area with a large number of trees and a holiday park on the lakeside. Ruataniwha is also one of New Zealand&#x27;s main rowing venues.

This was not planned as part of the hydroelectric project but instead came about as facilities were constructed as a public service on the instructions of Max Smith, the locally based Project Engineer of the Upper Waitaki Power Project. The rowing course was surveyed, landscaping undertaken and anchors put down for lane markers before the lake was filled. He reached agreement with the Rowing Association that it would fund the building of the regatta control building at an estimated cost of NZ$75,000. When pressure to complete the building before the official opening of the lake raised the cost to approximately NZ$130,000 he used project funds to temporarily bridge the gap until the Rowing Association made full payment.

Senior officials in the headquarters of the Ministry of Works alleged this was a misuse of funds. Despite overwhelming support from the local community, he took early retirement rather than face charges under the State Services Act. At the time Smith was voicing disagreement with the government&#x27;s proposals to reduce the Ministry of Works&#x27; experienced construction workforce and to disestablish Twizel; all of which may have influenced the official displeasure. The principal access road to the lake was named Max Smith Drive by the local community in his honour while the South Island Rowing Association made him its first life member.

The lake&#x27;s facilities can accommodate 600 rowing boats and 2000 competitors. The rowing course has eight lanes. The regatta control building contains a first aid room, drug testing area, administration rooms, storage rooms and on the upper floor, facilities for judges and the timekeepers, as well as a commentary room. The lake typically hosts an average of 5 major rowing events a year. The New Zealand national rowing championships are held there every second year, alternating with the national secondary school rowing championships. (During these the Maadi Cup is contested.)
The lake is also used for swimming, yachting, canoeing and windsurfing.

==In popular culture==

Lake Ruataniwha was a filming location for the 2009 zombie film &quot;Last of the Living&quot;.

<text>David Henshaw (April 2, 1791 – November 11, 1852), son of Captain David Henshaw and Mary Sargent, was the 14th United States Secretary of the Navy.

Henshaw was born in Leicester, Massachusetts in 1791 and educated at Leicester Academy. Trained as a druggist, he achieved notable success in that field, then expanded his energies into banking, transportation and politics. Before he was 33 he had acquired means to become a banker and to establish an insurance company.  The panic of 1837 forced his &quot;Commonwealth Bank&#x27; into bankruptcy. He was elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1826 and served as Collector of the Port of Boston from 1827 to 1830. In 1828, he handled a project for running railroad through the Berkshires to Albany, New York. Though he suffered business reverses during the later 1830s, Henshaw regained his political position as a leader of the Massachusetts Democratic Party within a few years.

In July 1843, President John Tyler selected Henshaw as Secretary of the Navy to follow Abel P. Upshur. During his brief term in office, he addressed shipbuilding problems, selected senior officers for important seagoing commands, revised supply arrangements in the Navy Yards and attempted to establish a school for Midshipmen. Another accomplishment during his tenure was saving the USS Constitution from the scrap heap. His recess appointment as Secretary failed to receive Congressional confirmation, requiring that he leave office when his successor, Thomas W. Gilmer, was confirmed. (Gilmer was killed, after only nine days in office, by a canon explosion while firing a salute to a ship passing in review) Henshaw then returned to Massachusetts politics. After he left this post he dominated Democratic affairs in Massachusetts until the slavery issue began to disrupt parties. He died in 1852, buried Pine Grove Cemetery, Leicester, Massachusetts.

David was conservative, he was a capitalist, a Mason, an opponent of prohibition and a friend of slaveholders.  He read much and possessed a keen knowledge of men.  Although he never married, he dispensed a generous hospitality at his country home in Leicester.

USS &quot;Henshaw&quot; (DD-278) was named in his honor.

<doc id="1088665" wikidata="Q302013" url="?curid=1088665" title="NForce4">
<text>The nForce4 is a motherboard chipset released by Nvidia in October 2004. The chipset supports AMD 64-bit processors (Socket 939, Socket AM2 and Socket 754) and Intel Pentium 4 LGA 775 processors.

==Models==
===nForce4/nForce4-4x===
nForce4 is the second evolution of the Media Communications Processor (MCP) and incorporates both Northbridge and Southbridge on a single die (the first was nForce3).

The Socket 754 version of the board has the HyperTransport link clocked to 800 MHz (6.4 GB/s transfer rate). 
Motherboards based on early revisions are mostly referred to as &quot;nForce4-4x&quot; (relating with their ability to handle HT speeds of 4x).

*Support for up to 20 PCI Express (PCIe) lanes (up to 38-40 lanes for the nForce4 SLI x16). Reference boards are set up with one x16 slot and three x1 slots, leaving 1 lane unused.
*Support for up to 10 USB 2.0 ports.
*Support for 4 SATA and 4 PATA drives, which can be linked together in any combination of SATA and PATA to form a RAID 0, 1, or 0+1.
*Nvidia RAID Morphing, which allows conversion from one RAID type to another on the fly.
*Nvidia nTune, a tool for easy overclocking and timing configurations.
*Full 1000 MHz speed on HyperTransport (8 GB/s transfer rate).
*Eight-channel AC&#x27;97 audio.
*Onboard Gigabit Ethernet.
*Nvidia ActiveArmor, an onboard firewall solution. (Not available on regular nForce 4)
*Does not support Windows 98 or Windows Me.

===nForce4 Ultra===
The Ultra version contains all of the features of the nForce4-4x version with the addition of:
*Hardware processing for the ActiveArmor to reduce CPU load.
*Serial ATA 3 Gbit/s interface with 300 MB/s transfer speeds for SATA 3 Gbit/s drives.

Enthusiasts discovered early after the release of nForce4 Ultra that the chipset was identical to nForce4 SLI other than a single resistor on the chip package itself. By modifying this resistor as the SLI is configured, an Ultra can be turned into an SLI.

===nForce4 SLI===
The SLI version has all the features of the Ultra version, in addition to SLI (Scalable Link Interface). This interface allows two video cards to be connected to produce a single output. This can theoretically double framerates by splitting work between the two GPUs.

On a standard (non x16) nForce4 SLI motherboard, the system can be configured to provide an x16 slot for one graphics board or twin x8 slots for the SLI configuration. A jumper bank must be altered to set these options.

===nForce4 SLI Intel Edition===
Unlike its AMD Athlon 64 sibling, the Intel Edition is an older chipset as it has both a northbridge and southbridge. As with the older nForce2 chipsets, Nvidia calls the northbridge the &quot;System Platform Processor&quot; (SPP) and the southbridge the &quot;Media and Communications Processor&quot; (MCP). This change in design was necessitated because, unlike the Athlon 64/Opteron, the Pentium 4 does not have an on-board memory controller thus requiring Nvidia to include one in the chipset like in older nForce2. In addition to supporting Pentium 4 processors (with up to a 1066 MHz FSB) the chipset includes support for DDR2 SDRAM. Also like Nvidia&#x27;s older chipsets, the MCP and SPP communicate through a Hypertransport link, in this case only at (1.6 GB/s. transfer rate) Apart from these differences, the nForce4 SLI Intel Edition shares the same features as the regular nForce4 SLI.

An oddity of the Intel Edition is the fact that while it works with the Pentium D 830 (3.0 GHz) and 840 (3.2 GHz), as well as the Extreme Edition of the 840, it does not work with the Pentium D 820 (2.8 GHz) because the 820 has a much lower current draw than the 830 and 840. Attempting to boot an Intel Edition board with an 820 will cause it to shut down so as to avoid damaging the processor. Nvidia have stated that they do not consider the 820 to be an enthusiast (because it is older) processor, and as such will not be enabling support for it. However, the nForce4 SLI X16 supports it.

===nForce4 SLI x16===
The nForce4 SLI x16 has similar features to the nForce4 SLI, except it now provides 16 PCI-Express lanes to both graphics cards in an SLI configuration (as opposed to only 8 lanes per graphics card with the original SLI chipset).
This is the only version of the nForce4 for AMD processors that has a separate northbridge and southbridge. It comprises the existing nForce4 MCP for the southbridge and a new AMD nForce4 System Platform Processor (SPP). The two chips are connected via the HyperTransport link. This solution provides 38 PCI-Express lanes in total, and can be divided over 7 slots.
It is also available for Intel processors, whereby it provides 40 PCI-Express lanes, which can be divided over 9 slots.

==Southbridges==
===nForce400/405/410/430===
The nForce400/405/410/430 refer to nForce4 based southbridges which are used together with GeForce 6100/6150 series northbridges to form a chipset with integrated graphics. The combination is a follow-up to the popular nForce2 IGP chipset.

==Driver Availability==
Nvidia offers nForce4 chipset driver downloads for NT-based Windows versions from 2000 up to and including Vista in the &quot;Legacy&quot; product type category on their download page. However, there is no official support for Windows 7 or newer, but Windows 7 has a built-in driver for the nForce 6 chipset, which is very similar.

==Flaws==

Nvidia&#x27;s nForce4 chipset suffers from several unresolved issues.

The ActiveArmor hardware firewall is nearly non-functional, with many unsolved bugs and potentially serious instability issues. Installing ActiveArmor can cause BSODs for users of certain software, especially peer-to-peer file sharing applications. Some programs, such as μTorrent, go so far as to have warning messages about using Nvidia&#x27;s firewall in combination with their software. ActiveArmor also has a high probability of causing corruption of file downloads. Nvidia has been unable to solve these issues and points to hardware bugs within the chipset itself, problems which they are unable to work around.

There have also been data corruption issues associated with certain SATA 3 Gbit/s hard drives. The issues can often be resolved with a firmware update for the hard drive from the manufacturer.

The nForce4 chipset has also been blamed for issues with PCI cards, relating to Nvidia&#x27;s implementation of the PCI bus. RME Audio, a maker of professional audio equipment, has stated that the latency of the PCI bus is unreliable and that the chipset&#x27;s PCI Express interface can &quot;hog&quot; system data transfer resources when intense video card usage is occurring. This has the effect of causing audible pops and clicks with PCI sound cards. Gamers have noticed this effect, especially with Creative&#x27;s Sound Blaster X-Fi and Sound Blaster Audigy 2 sound cards. Compatibility issues between these sound cards and nForce4 motherboards have been ongoing, including reports of serious and irreversible damage to crucial motherboard components. Driver updates were also found to be unsuccessful. Latency issues are more readily apparent with sound cards than other addon cards because of the direct user feedback the audio problems demonstrate.

<doc id="1088674" wikidata="Q737926" url="?curid=1088674" title="Scalable Link Interface">
<text>Scalable Link Interface (SLI) is the brand name for a now discontinued multi-GPU technology developed by Nvidia (The technology was invented and developed by 3dfx and later purchased by Nvidia during the acquisition of 3dfx) for linking two or more video cards together to produce a single output. SLI is a parallel processing algorithm for computer graphics, meant to increase the available processing power.

The initialism SLI was first used by 3dfx for Scan-Line Interleave, which was introduced to the consumer market in 1998 and used in the Voodoo2 line of video cards. After buying out 3dfx, Nvidia acquired the technology but did not use it. Nvidia later reintroduced the SLI name in 2004 and intended for it to be used in modern computer systems based on the PCI Express (PCIe) bus; however, the technology behind the name SLI has changed dramatically.

==Implementation==
SLI allows two, three, or four graphics processing units (GPUs) to share the workload when rendering real-time 3D computer graphics. Ideally, identical GPUs are installed on the motherboard that contains enough PCI Express slots, set up in a master–slave configuration. All graphics cards are given an equal workload to render, but the final output of each card is sent to the master card via a connector called the SLI bridge. For example, in a two graphics card setup, the master works on the top half of the scene, the slave the bottom half. Once the slave is done, it sends its render to the master to combine into one image before sending it to the monitor.

The SLI bridge is used to reduce bandwidth constraints and send data between both graphics cards directly. It is possible to run SLI without using the bridge connector on a pair of low-end to mid-range graphics cards (e.g., 7100GS or 6600GT) with Nvidia&#x27;s Forceware drivers 80.XX or later. Since these graphics cards do not use as much bandwidth, data can be relayed through just the chipsets on the motherboard. However, if there are two high-end graphics cards installed and the SLI bridge is omitted, the performance will suffer severely, as the chipset does not have enough bandwidth.

Configurations include:
* Two-way, three-way, and four-way SLI uses two, three, or four individual graphics cards respectively. 
* Two GPUs on one graphics card. Examples include the GeForce GTX 590, the GeForce GTX 690 and the GeForce GTX Titan Z. This configuration has the advantage of implementing two-way SLI, while only occupying one PCI Express slot and (usually) two expansion I/O slots. This also allows for four-way SLI using only two cards (which is referred to as Quad SLI).

Nvidia has created a set of custom video game profiles in cooperation with video game publishers that will automatically enable SLI in the mode that gives the largest performance boost.

Nvidia has three types of SLI bridges:
*Standard bridge (400 MHz pixel clock and 1 GB/s bandwidth)
*LED bridge (540 MHz pixel clock)
*High-bandwidth bridge (650 MHz pixel clock and 2 GB/s bandwidth)

The standard bridge is traditionally included with motherboards that support SLI and is recommended for monitors up to 1920×1080 and 2560×1440 at 60 Hz. The LED bridge is sold by Nvidia, EVGA, and others and is recommended for monitors up to 2560×1440 at 120 Hz and above and 4K. The LED bridges can only function at the increased pixel clock if the GPU supports that clock. The high-bandwidth bridge is only sold by Nvidia and is recommended for monitors up to 5K and surround.

The following table provides an overview on the maximum theoretical bandwidth for data transfers depending on bridge type specifications as found on the open market:
==SLI modes==

===Split-frame rendering (SFR)===
This analyzes the rendered image in order to split the workload equally between the two GPUs. To do this, the frame is split horizontally in varying ratios depending on geometry. For example, in a scene where the top half of the frame is mostly empty sky, the dividing line will lower, balancing geometry workload between the two GPUs.

===Alternate-frame rendering (AFR)===
Each GPU renders entire frames in sequence. For example, in a two-way setup, one GPU renders the odd frames, the other the even frames, one after the other. Finished outputs are sent to the master for display. Ideally, this would result in the rendering time being cut by the number of GPUs available. In their advertising, Nvidia claims up to 1.9 times the performance of one card with the two-way setup. While AFR may produce higher overall framerates than SFR, it also exhibits the temporal artifact known as micro stuttering, which may affect frame rate perception. It is noteworthy that while the frequency at which frames arrive may be doubled, the time to produce the frame is not reduced – which means that AFR is not a viable method of reducing input lag.

===SLI antialiasing===
This is a standalone rendering mode that offers up to double the antialiasing performance by splitting the antialiasing workload between the two graphics cards, offering superior image quality. One GPU performs an antialiasing pattern which is slightly offset to the usual pattern (for example, slightly up and to the right), and the second GPU uses a pattern offset by an equal amount in the opposite direction (down and to the left). Compositing both the results gives higher image quality than is normally possible. This mode is not intended for higher frame rates, and can actually lower performance, but is instead intended for games which are not GPU-bound, offering a clearer image in place of better performance. When enabled, SLI antialiasing offers advanced antialiasing options: SLI 8×, SLI 16×, and SLI 32× (for quad SLI systems only).

===Hybrid SLI===
Hybrid SLI is the generic name for two technologies, GeForce Boost and HybridPower.

GeForce Boost allows the rendering power of an integrated graphics processor (IGP) and a discrete GPU to be combined in order to increase performance.

HybridPower, on the other hand, is another mode that is not for performance enhancement. The setup consists of an IGP as well as a GPU on MXM module. The IGP would assist the GPU to boost performance when the laptop is plugged to a power socket while the MXM module would be shut down when the laptop was unplugged from power socket to lower overall graphics power consumption. Hybrid SLI is also available on desktop Motherboards and PCs with PCI-E discrete video cards. NVIDIA claims that twice the performance can be achieved with a Hybrid SLI capable IGP motherboard and a GeForce 8400 GS video card.

HybridPower was later renamed as Nvidia Optimus.

==SLI HB==
In May 2016 Nvidia announced that the GeForce 10 series would feature a new SLI HB (High Bandwidth) bridge; this bridge uses 2 SLI fingers on the PCB of each card and essentially doubles the available bandwidth between them. Only GeForce 10 series cards support SLI HB and only 2-way SLI is supported over this bridge for single-GPU cards. SLI HB interface runs at 650 MHz, while legacy SLI interface runs at slower 400 MHz.

Electrically there is little difference between the regular SLI bridge and the SLI HB bridge. It is similar to two regular bridges combined in one PCB. The signal quality of the bridge improved, however, as the SLI HB bridge has an adjusted trace-length to make sure all traces on the bridge have exactly the same length.

A PC gaming magazine did a comparison between SLI bridges and their SLI HB successors with X-rays, and found differences in the PCB tracing allowed clock rates to go up from 400 MHz to 650 MHz and thus the data rates along with that. With the increased bus width a noticeable bandwidth increase should be expected; however tests with a GTX 1080 GPU showed the improvements in gaming performance were marginal. Newer HB bridges are LED illuminated (often back-side-illuminating some logo) and as a result more costly than earlier bridges at a comparable base functionality.

==Caveats==
* Not all motherboards with multiple PCI-Express x16 slots support SLI. On August 10, 2009, Nvidia announced that Intel and other leading motherboard manufacturers including ASUS, EVGA, Gigabyte and MSI have all licensed Nvidia SLI technology for inclusion on their Intel P55 Express Chipset-based motherboards designed for the upcoming Intel Core i7 and i5 processor in the LGA 1156 socket. Older motherboards using the P55&#x27;s predecessors Intel P35 or Intel P45 do not support SLI. Recent motherboards as of October 2017 that support it are Intel&#x27;s Z and X series chipsets (Z68, Z77, Z87, Z97, Z170, Z270, Z370, X79, X99 and X299) along with AMD&#x27;s 990FX, X370 and X399 chipsets. Earlier chipsets, such as the Intel X58, could support 2-way SLI over 16 lane PCI-e. In order for motherboards of that generation to support more than two GPUs they were required to implement Nvidia nForce chipsets.
* In an SLI configuration, cards can be of mixed manufacturers, card model names, BIOS revisions or clock speeds. However, they must be of the same GPU series (e.g., 8600, 8800) and GPU model name (e.g., GT, GTS, GTX). There are rare exceptions for &quot;mixed SLI&quot; configurations on some cards that only have a matching core codename (e.g., G70, G73, G80, etc.), but this is otherwise not possible, and only happens when two matched cards differ only very slightly, an example being a differing amount of video memory, stream processors, or clockspeed. In this case, the slower/lesser card becomes dominant, and the other card matches. Another exception is the GTS 250, which can be paired with the 9800 GTX+, as the GTS 250 GPU is a rebadged 9800 GTX+ GPU.
* In cases where two cards are not identical, the faster card – or the card with more memory - will run at the speed of the slower card or disable its additional memory. (Note that while the FAQ still claims different memory size support, the support has been removed since revision 100.xx of Nvidia&#x27;s Forceware driver suite.)
* SLI does not always give a performance benefit – in some extreme cases, it can lower the frame rate due to the particulars of an application&#x27;s coding. This is also true for AMD&#x27;s CrossFire, as the problem is inherent in multi-GPU systems. This is often witnessed when running an application at low resolutions.
* Vsync + Triple buffering is not supported in some cases in SLI AFR mode.
* Users having a Hybrid SLI setup must manually change modes between &quot;HybridPower&quot; and &quot;GeForce Boost&quot;, while automatically changing mode will not be available until future updates become available. Hybrid SLI supports only single link DVI at 1920×1200 screen resolution.
* When using SLI with AFR, the subjective framerate can often be lower than the framerate reported by benchmarking applications, and may even be poorer than the framerate of its single-GPU equivalent. This phenomenon is known as micro stuttering and also applies to CrossFire since it is inherent to multi-GPU configurations.
*With the new RTX 20xx series of graphics cards as launched in 2018 the interconnect is no longer SLI HB. These newer cards are using NVLink as its communication base and require either a three-slot-long or four-slot-long NVLink bridge - reasoned partially by thermal considerations and by socket availability. As of now only two GPU cards can be connected with NVLink; three-way, four-way and quad are not possible using NVLink bridges even if NVLink by principle is a very versatile interface.
* As of the GeForce RTX 3000-series, SLI has been effectively replaced with NVLink.

==Discontinuance==
In 2020 Nvidia announced that they would no longer be adding new SLI driver profiles on RTX 2000 series and older, from January 1 2021. It was possible for game developers to use DirectX 12 or Vulkan to introduce a multi-GPU setup without an SLI or CrossFire connection, but few developers supported the feature &amp; with the increased graphical performance of newer video cards, multi-GPU setups for gaming were rendered obsolete by the early 2020s.

<doc id="1088677" wikidata="Q673738" url="?curid=1088677" title="The Draughtsman's Contract">
<text>The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract is a 1982 British period comedy-drama film written and directed by Peter Greenaway – his first conventional feature film (following the feature-length mockumentary &quot;The Falls&quot;). Originally produced for Channel 4, the film is a form of murder mystery, set in rural Wiltshire, England in 1694 (during the joint reign of William III and Mary II). The period setting is reflected in Michael Nyman&#x27;s score, which borrows widely from Henry Purcell, and in the extensive and elaborate costume designs (which, for effect, slightly exaggerate those of the period). The action was shot on location in the house and formal gardens of Groombridge Place. The film received the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

==Plot==
Mr Neville, a young and conceited artist, is contracted by Mrs Virginia Herbert to produce a series of twelve landscape drawings of her country house, its outbuildings and gardens, as a gift for her cold and neglectful husband, who is currently away on business.

Part of the contract is that Mrs Herbert agrees to comply with Mr Neville&#x27;s sexual demands. Several sexual encounters between them follow, each indicating reluctance or distress on the part of Mrs Herbert, and sexual aggression or insensitivity on the part of Mr Neville. During his stay, Mr Neville becomes disliked by several of the estate&#x27;s inhabitants and visitors, especially by Mrs Herbert&#x27;s German son-in-law, Mr Talmann.

Eventually Mrs Herbert, wearied by Mr Neville&#x27;s excessive sexual appetite, tries to terminate the contract before the drawings are completed. But Neville refuses and their encounters continue as before. Then Mrs Herbert&#x27;s married but childless daughter, Mrs Talmann, frustrated by her husband&#x27;s lack of interest in sex, blackmails Neville into a second contract, in which he agrees to comply with her sexual demands, rather than she with his. Mrs Talmann wishes to become pregnant, and knows this is unlikely to happen with her husband.

Mr Herbert does not return when expected, and his dead body is eventually discovered in the moat. Mr Neville completes his drawings and leaves, but returns to make an unlucky thirteenth drawing. During his visit, he is surprised when Mrs Herbert propositions him for sex, and they make love. Mrs Herbert also indicates that her daughter&#x27;s plan to conceive a child by Mr Neville has been successful.

In the evening, while Mr Neville is apparently finishing the final sketch, he is approached by a masked man, obviously Mr Talmann in disguise, who is then joined by the estate manager and Mrs Herbert&#x27;s former fiancé, Mr Noyes, her neighbour Mr Seymour, and the Poulenc twins, eccentric local landowners.

The party accuses Mr Neville of the murder of Mr Herbert, for the drawings can be interpreted to suggest more than one illegal act and to implicate more than one person. They also accuse him of the sexual violation of Mrs Herbert, as evidenced by his sexual congress with her that afternoon.

Neville realises, too late, that he has been entrapped by Mrs Herbert. Despite his protests, the group of men blind him and beat him to death, finally casting his body into the moat at the place where Mr Herbert&#x27;s corpse was found.

==Cast==
==Themes==
Although there is a murder mystery, its resolution is not explicit; it is implied that the mother (Mrs Herbert) and daughter (Mrs Talmann) planned the murder of Mr Herbert. Mrs Herbert and Mrs Talmann were aided by Mr Clarke, the gardener, and his assistant.

In order to keep the estate in their hands, they needed an heir. Because Mr Talmann was impotent, they used Mr Neville as a stud. Mr Herbert was murdered at the site where Mr Neville is murdered. (In the original treatment, Mr Herbert is murdered on his return on the 12th day and the site was vetoed as a painting site, because it was instead to be used as a murder site.)

== Background ==
The film was inspired when Greenaway, who trained as an artist before becoming a filmmaker, spent three weeks drawing a house near Hay-on-Wye while holidaying with his family. Much like Mr Neville in the final film, every day he would work on a particular view at a set time, to preserve the lighting effects while sketching from day to day. The hands shown drawing in the film are Greenaway&#x27;s own, as are the completed drawings.

The original cut of the film was about three hours long. The opening scene was about 30 minutes long and showed each character talking, at least once, with every other character. Possibly to make the film easier to watch, Greenaway edited it to 103 minutes. The opening scene is now about 10 minutes long and no longer shows all the interactions among all of the characters. Some anomalies in the longer version film are deliberate anachronisms: the depiction of the use of a cordless phone in the 17th century and the inclusion on the walls of the house of paintings by Greenaway in emulation of Roy Lichtenstein which are partly visible in the released version of the film.

The released final version provides fewer explanations to the plot&#x27;s numerous oddities and mysteries. The main murder mystery is never solved, though little doubt remains as to who did it. The reasons for the &#x27;living statue&#x27; in the garden and why Mr Neville attached so many conditions to his contract were also more developed in the first version.

==Locations==
Groombridge Place was the main shooting location.
==Music==
Michael Nyman&#x27;s score is derived from grounds by Henry Purcell overlaid with new melodies, while one of the recurring tracks, apparently excluded from the film&#x27;s soundtrack, is at least partly derived from the second movement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Violin Sonata in E Minor, K. 304. The original plan was to use one ground for every two of the twelve drawings but Nyman states in the liner notes that this was unworkable. The ground for one of the most popular pieces, &quot;An Eye for Optical Theory&quot;, is considered to be probably composed by William Croft, a contemporary of Purcell. The goal was to create a generalized memory of Purcell, rather than specific memories, so a piece as readily recognizable as &quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot; was not considered an acceptable source of a ground. Purcell is credited as a &quot;music consultant&quot;.

The album was the fourth album release by Michael Nyman and the third to feature the Michael Nyman Band. &quot;It&#x27;s like harpsichord and a lot of strings, woodwind and a bit of brass,&quot; remarked Neil Hannon, frontman of The Divine Comedy. &quot;Somehow they just manage to… rock. With a vengeance.&quot;

The following ground sources are taken from the chart in Pwyll ap Siôn&#x27;s &quot;The Music of Michael Nyman: Text, Context and Intertext&quot;, reordered to match their sequence on the album.

The album was issued on compact disc in 1989 by Virgin Records, marketed in the United States by Caroline Records under their Blue Plate imprint. Initially this was indicated with a sticker; it was later incorporated into the back cover design in a much smaller size.

The entire album has been rerecorded by the current lineup of the Michael Nyman Band. See &quot;The Composer&#x27;s Cut Series Vol. I: The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot;.

== Art references ==
The visual references for the film are paintings by Caravaggio, de La Tour, Rembrandt, Vermeer and other Baroque artists and this gives the film a &quot;painterly quality&quot;. Greenaway also said: &quot;I consider that 90% of my films one way or another refers to paintings. &quot;Contract&quot; quite openly refers to Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour and other French and Italian artists&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; has a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Smart and utterly original, &quot;The Draughtsman&#x27;s Contract&quot; is a period piece that marks the further maturation of a writer-director with a thrillingly unique vision&quot;. Roger Ebert, who gave the film a full four stars, wrote, &quot;What we have here is a tantalizing puzzle, wrapped in eroticism and presented with the utmost elegance. [...] All of the characters speak in complete, elegant, literary sentences. All of the camera strategies are formal and mannered. The movie advances with the grace and precision of a well-behaved novel.&quot; In &quot;Slant&quot;, a mildly positive Jeremiah Kipp called it &quot;a first, fledgling attempt at what he later perfected, but that modesty could be seen as a virtue, since there is indeed some form of narrative here instead of the nonlinear, compulsive list-making and categorization that drives some people crazy about his other films. [...] The story marches forward like a death march and is resolved with merciless efficiency.&quot; Danny Peary wrote that &quot;Greenaway handles everything with such elegance that we are totally unprepared for the final act of cruelty. Ending is haunting; it makes you reassess all that went before – supposed victims are really heartless predators.&quot;

== Restoration ==
The film was originally shot on  then blown up to  for cinema releases. In 2003 the BFI restored the film digitally and this restoration was released on DVD. Umbrella Entertainment released the digitally restored film on DVD in Australia, with special features including an introduction and commentary by Peter Greenaway, an interview with composer Michael Nyman, behind the scenes footage and on set interviews, deleted scenes, trailers and a featurette on the film&#x27;s digital restoration.

<doc id="1088681" wikidata="Q7735593" url="?curid=1088681" title="The Gadget Maker">
<text>The Gadget Maker is a 1954 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.

On its appearance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Gadget Maker&quot; as &quot;the story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledge&quot; and called it &quot;an absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The novel traces the life of Stanley Brack, captivated by model aircraft as a child. He enters MIT, and in a memorable scene, is interviewed by the head of the School of Aeronautical Engineering, a legendary German aerodynamicist. His main concern is unexpected. &quot;From your hair and general coloring,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I thought you might perhaps be Jewish.&quot; Brack reassures him that he and both his parents are Baptists and of Scots-Irish descent. &quot;We have to be careful,&quot; the professor confides; &quot;The aircraft industry is one of the few &quot;they&quot; haven&#x27;t managed to take over yet,&quot; and congratulates Stanley on his acceptance into the course. The incident turns out to be one of many in which Brack swallows any thought of protest and goes along to get along.

After graduation, he joins Amcraft, the Amalgamated Aircraft Corporation, in Los Angeles. It is a manufacturer of aircraft components that is just about to unveil its first complete airplane, a transport. The company is run personally by Dave Humbler, &quot;president, founder of the company, chief engineer—big wheel number one. Real nice guy, Dave,&quot; a colleague explains. (Resemblances can be seen to the Douglas Aircraft Company.) Brack rises through the ranks and grows with the company.

After the war Amcraft acquires the services of Gunther Rausch, &quot;a spoil of war&quot; and a rocket expert from Peenemünde. His presence gives the company an edge in picking up missile work.

Rausch is brilliant but arrogant and Brack detests him. Nevertheless, as the book draws to a climax, he makes common cause with him in an effort to perfect a guided missile. Brack is the project manager, and the project is in trouble and behind schedule. He pressures a friend and colleague into conducting some dangerous rocket tests with Rausch. Rausch is tense and jittery and gives coworkers an impression that he is concealing personal inexperience in conducting such tests. There is an explosion, and Brack&#x27;s friend Sim suffers terrible injuries: physical and chemical burns and lung damage that leaves him close to death.

Brack&#x27;s fiancée, a witness, tells Brack that Rausch was panicky during the test and &quot;never stopped fiddling with the switches... he was like some hot-head whose car won&#x27;t start but who keeps on turning the ignition switch.&quot; She thinks Rausch could have caused the explosion (a concern which ultimately turns out to be unfounded). Brack furiously argues with Rausch, then debates with his superior about the project&#x27;s future and who should lead it. Brack convinces his superior to let him continue as leader. As the discussion closes, his superior says &quot;Okay, it&#x27;s all settled.&quot; But he adds &quot;One other thing—I&#x27;m firing the girl.&quot; Brack&#x27;s protest sticks in his throat; &quot;ashamed, he looked at his feet, and then he nodded.&quot;

The book closes with Brack and Rausch standing together literally arm in arm, watching the conclusion of a successful missile test. &quot;Did you see it, Gunther?&quot; Brack says. &quot;Yah,&quot; breaths Rausch, &quot;Just like a star. A shooting star.&quot; &quot;And we made it,&quot; says Brack, proudly, as the tale ends.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer says that &quot;the question arises... whether Brack is to be regarded as an all-wool idealist pursuing heroically his destiny despite any and all distractions tossed in his way. Or is he a less desirable type, possessed of the ability to abandon all pretense to ethical conduct in his ambitious pursuit after self-advancement?&quot;

Although the &quot;Times&quot; calls it an &quot;absorbing narrative,&quot; to a modern reader much of the interest lies, not in the broad story outline, but in the dozens of little details and circumstantial touches which bring times, places, and situations—not well documented elsewhere—to life.

==Quotations==
*At night, floodlights glare from artfully concealing shrubbery and lave the main building with a white light that emphasizes black-trimmed, three-story windows rising in uninterrupted, eye-leading verticals toward a dominant, austere dome mimicked from some classic pile of ancient Rome. On every slab-sided cornice, like proclamations of faith needing no explanation, are chiseled Darwin, Newton, Aristotle and, in lesser letters, the names of the more numerous Lavoisiers and Eulers and Faradays who have discovered the chemical elements or evolved the equations or stumbled upon the fundamentals of nature. Indeed, not unlovely is the breeding ground of technicians and engineers which, as announced in stone above great, fluted columns, is the MASSACHVSETTS INSTITVTE OF TECHNOLOGY.

*&quot;What do you expect from me—miracles!&quot; Rausch demanded angrily. &quot;Do you expect me to build an engine—&quot; he snapped his fingers—&quot;like so? I am a scientist, not a magician! To develop a new engine you must haf an organization that can supply the test benches with one experimental engine after the other. You must make, break and remake engines until you get one that works.&quot;

<text>Wentworth County, area , is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

It was created in 1816 as part of the Gore District (1816-1849) in what was then Upper Canada and later Canada West (1841-1867). It was named in honour of Sir John Wentworth, the last royal governor of colonial New Hampshire, lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia (1792 to 1808) and an intimate friend of William Jarvis, the first provincial secretary of Upper Canada. The county originally consisted of seven townships that formerly belonged to Haldimand, Lincoln and York Counties.

Between 1850 and 1854, Wentworth County and Halton County were briefly joined for government purposes as the United Counties of Wentworth and Halton although for administrative purposes, they remained distinct.

In 1973, Wentworth County was replaced by the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth. In 2001, the Regional Municipality and its six constituent municipalities were amalgamated as the &quot;megacity&quot; of Hamilton.

==Constituent townships==
Each township that was ever part of the county is listed alphabetically below along with its years of existence, and its previous and subsequent configurations.

* Ancaster, area , (surveyed 1798), 1816–1973, later became a village then town and part of township to Town of Dundas
* Barton, area . The township was surveyed 1792 and named after the English town. The township included Hamilton and existed from 1816 to 1973, later became Village and City of Hamilton
* Beverley, area . Surveyed and opened for settlement in 1798. The five northern concessions were surveyed in 1794 and the southern part in 1797. The Township was named from the town in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Community centres were: Copetown, Lynden, Rockton and Westover. The Township existed from 1851 to 1973, later divided with one part to North Dumfries, Ontario and majority to Town of Flamborough
* Binbrook (surveyed 1798), existed from 1816 to 1973, later one half of Glanbrook Township
* Caistor, existed from 1845 to 1851, earlier and later part of Haldimand County, then Lincoln County and, since 1970, the Township of West Lincoln in the Regional Municipality of Niagara 
* Flamborough East, area . Both East and West Flamborough were surveyed and opened for settlement in 1792. The Township existed from 1851 to 1973, later divided with one part to City of Burlington and majority to Town of Flamborough
* Flamborough West, area Both East and West Flamborough were surveyed and opened for settlement in 1792. The Township existed from 1851 to 1973, later divided with one part to Town of Dundas and majority to Town of Flamborough
* Glanford, area Was surveyed and opened for settlement in 1798. The township was named from Glanford-Brigg in Lincolnshire. Community centres were Glanford and Fenton. The Township existed from 1816 to 1974. The Township was later the other half of Glanbrook Township
* Onondaga, existed from 1816 to 1851, home of the Six Nations of the Grand River
* Saltfleet, area . Was surveyed and opened in 1792. The name was suggested by the existence of several salt water springs. The Township existed from 1816 to 1973, later the town and city of Stoney Creek
* Seneca, existed from 1816 to 1851, later part of Brant County

<doc id="1088686" wikidata="Q354174" url="?curid=1088686" title="Clive Burr">
<text>Clive Ronald Burr (8 March 1956 – 12 March 2013) was an English musician. He was the drummer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden from 1979 to 1982. Together with fellow Iron Maiden member Dennis Stratton, he joined Praying Mantis for the recording of their 1996 live album &quot;Captured Alive in Tokyo City&quot;.

==Career==
Previously a member of Samson, Burr joined Iron Maiden in 1979. Auditioning and joining upon the recommendation of then-Iron Maiden guitarist Dennis Stratton, Burr played on their first three records: &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;Killers&quot; and their breakthrough release &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, the last of which was the Maiden debut of Bruce Dickinson. Burr was fired from the band in 1982 during The Beast on the Road tour. He was replaced by the band&#x27;s now retired drummer, Nicko McBrain. Burr co-wrote one song on &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Gangland&quot;, and another song, &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, that was cut from the album and showed up as the B-side of the &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; single, and later on the &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; remastered CD re-release, and again on the 2022 40th Anniversary record, where it replaced Gangland. Burr also appeared on &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; (a cover of the Australian band Skyhooks).

In an interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in February 2011, Burr candidly discussed his split from Maiden. Describing much of what has been written about the split as &quot;hogwash&quot;, Burr indicated that he was ousted from the band after taking a break to mourn the recent death of his father, rebutting claims that his departure was due to overindulgence. Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s 2017 autobiography suggests Burr was ousted due to personality conflicts with Steve Harris which led to the two arguing and acting out during performances.

After &quot;leaving&quot; Iron Maiden, Burr briefly played in the French group Trust, thus switching places with McBrain, and briefly with the American band Alcatrazz. Burr was featured in the short-lived NWOBHM supergroup Gogmagog which also included ex-Iron Maiden vocalist Paul Di&#x27;Anno and future Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, ex Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray and ex Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis. He also had a band known as Clive Burr&#x27;s Escape (later known as Stratus), featuring former Praying Mantis members and future Uriah Heep vocalist Bernie Shaw, which disbanded after releasing one album. Burr then joined Dee Snider in his post-Twisted Sister outfit Desperado, which was never fully realized due to a falling out with the band&#x27;s record company. Burr performed with British bands Elixir and Praying Mantis in the 1990s and appears on the Praying Mantis 1996 live album &quot;Captured Alive in Tokyo City&quot;, but did not become a full member of either.

Burr&#x27;s signature white drum kit was donated to the Hard Rock Cafe in London in 2005.

==Illness==
Burr was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the late 1990s, the treatment of which left him deeply in debt. Iron Maiden staged a series of charity concerts and were involved in the founding of the Clive Burr MS Trust Fund. Burr used a wheelchair due to his condition.

He was also the patron of Clive Aid, a charity formed in 2004. Clive Aid has continued to raise awareness and funds for various cancer and multiple sclerosis programs around the world through the staging of rock events. Burr attended many of these events. His partner Mimi was also diagnosed with MS.

==Death==
Burr died in his sleep on 12 March 2013 in London due to complications related to MS.

In a statement released on the band&#x27;s website Iron Maiden bass player Steve Harris stated &quot;This is terribly sad news. Clive was a very old friend of all of us. He was a wonderful person and an amazing drummer who made a valuable contribution to Maiden in the early days when we were starting out. This is a sad day for everyone in the band and those around him and our thoughts and condolences are with his partner Mimi and family at this time.&quot;

Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson stated &quot;Even during the darkest days of his M.S., Clive never lost his sense of humour or irreverence.&quot;

A funeral service was held for Burr on 25 March 2013 in London.

== Legacy ==
Burr&#x27;s style was influential on many heavy metal drummers. Dave Lombardo, known for his work with bands such as Slayer, Grip Inc., Fantômas, Suicidal Tendencies and Testament stated that &quot;his style was inspiring and the albums he recorded with Iron Maiden are touchstones of my music education&quot;. Charlie Benante of Anthrax said: &quot;the drumming on &#x27;Killers&#x27; inspired me to kick it up a notch and I did.&quot; According to Dave McClain, former drummer for Machine Head, who considers Burr a huge influence, he &quot;brought punk rock drumming into heavy metal&quot;.

Other drummers like Lars Ulrich (Metallica), Paul Bostaph (Slayer, Exodus, Testament), Stefan Schwarzmann (Helloween, Krokus), Chris Reifert (Death, Autopsy), Steve Asheim (Deicide), Jan Axel Blomberg (Mayhem), Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall) and Richard Christy (Iced Earth, Death, Charred Walls of the Damned) also cited Burr as an influence.

Jeff Waters, guitarist and leader of Annihilator, regards his drumming as an inspiration on the drum parts he writes for his band.

Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickinson considered him to be &quot;...the best drummer the band ever had. That&#x27;s not taking anything away from [present drummer] Nicko. Technically, Nicko&#x27;s probably a far more competent drummer than Clive. It&#x27;s just that Clive had this incredible feel, and you can&#x27;t learn that, and I regret that he wasn&#x27;t given more time to try and sort himself out.&quot; Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith also praised his drumming ability. &quot;Clive was a great drummer, an Ian Paice-type drummer, steady and solid with a nice feel to everything.&quot;

In a tribute article posted by Rolling Stone the day after Burr&#x27;s passing, writer Greg Prato pointed out that &quot;It was Burr&#x27;s drumming that proved a major ingredient on such early Maiden classics as 1980&#x27;s self-titled debut, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Killers&quot; and 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, and such headbanging anthems as &#x27;Running Free,&#x27; &#x27;Wrathchild&#x27; and &#x27;Run to the Hills&#x27;.&quot;

<text>The Dart River (officially Dart River / Te Awa Whakatipu from ) flows through rugged forested country in the southwestern South Island of New Zealand. Partly in Mount Aspiring National Park, it flows south-west and then south for from its headwaters in the Southern Alps and the Dart Glacier, eventually flowing into the northern end of Lake Wakatipu near Glenorchy.

There are many popular tramping tracks in the region. The Rees-Dart Track is a five-day loop which combines the valley of Te Awa Whakatipu with the nearby Rees River. Jetboats operate on the river.

The Dart River, as many other areas in and around the Glenorchy and Queenstown area, was the location for many scenes filmed for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. Examples are Isengard, filmed at Dan&#x27;s Paddock, and Lothlórien in the forests slightly further north. The only road bridge across the river, north of Glenorchy and en route to the start of the Routeburn Track, was used as the eponymous bridge in the 2020 television drama series &quot;One Lane Bridge&quot;.

The upper valley was the site of one of New Zealand&#x27;s worst light aircraft accidents in 1989, when an Aspiring Air Britten-Norman Islander crashed, killing all ten people on board.

==Name==
The river was first known by its Māori name of , with literally translating as &#x27;the river&#x27;. The name &quot;Whakatipu&quot; is shared with several nearby geographic features, including Lake Wakatipu and Whakatipu Kā Tuka (the Hollyford River) though this name is an archaic term and its original meaning is no longer known. During the 1860s, the William Gilbert Rees named the river the Dart, after the river&#x27;s swift flow.

In 1998, the river became one of nearly 90 geographic features to be given an official dual name as part of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, a Treaty of Waitangi settlement between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown. This dual name combined the name Dart River with the Māori name, in recognition of the significance of both names.

<text>Navy One is the call sign of any United States Navy aircraft carrying the president of the United States.

There has only been one aircraft designated as Navy One: a Lockheed S-3 Viking, BuNo &quot;159387&quot;, assigned to the &quot;Blue Wolves&quot; of VS-35, which transported President George W. Bush to the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; off the coast of San Diego, California, on 1 May 2003. The pilot was Commander John &quot;Skip&quot; Lussier, then VS-35&#x27;s executive officer; and the flight officer was Lieutenant Ryan &quot;Wilson&quot; Phillips. The S-3 used for the flight was retired from service and placed on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida on 17 July 2003.

A Navy aircraft carrying the vice president would be designated Navy Two.

<doc id="1088701" wikidata="Q230962" url="?curid=1088701" title="Hiromu Arakawa">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known for the manga series &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2001–2010), which became a hit both domestically and internationally, and was adapted into two anime television series. She is also known for &quot;Silver Spoon&quot; (2011–2019) and the manga adaptation of &quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan&quot; novels.

==Biography==
Born on May 8, 1973, in Tokachi, Hokkaidō, Japan, Arakawa was born and raised on a dairy farm with three elder sisters and a younger brother. Arakawa thought about being a manga artist ever &quot;since [she] was little&quot; and during her school years, she would often draw on textbooks. After graduating high school, she took oil painting classes once a month for seven years while working on her family&#x27;s farm. During this time, she also created dōjinshi manga with her friends and drew yonkoma for a magazine.

Arakawa moved to Tokyo in the summer of 1999. She began her career in the manga world as a Square Enix employee and assistant to Hiroyuki Etō, author of &quot;Mahōjin Guru Guru&quot;. Her own career began with the publication of &quot;Stray Dog&quot; in Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; in 1999. &quot;Stray Dog&quot; won the ninth 21st Century &quot;Shōnen Gangan&quot; Award. She published one chapter of &quot;Shanghai Yōmakikai&quot; in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; in 2000.

In July 2001, Arakawa published the first chapter of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot;. The series spanned 108 chapters, with the last one published in July 2010, and the series was collected in twenty-seven volumes. Some reviewers say that the combination of Arakawa&#x27;s art style and the writing in &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; contribute to its dark thematic elements. &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; has been adapted into two anime series by Bones. When they were creating the first, Arakawa assisted them in its early development. However, she was not involved in the making of the script, so the anime has a different ending from the manga, which she developed further. The series won the 49th Shogakukan Manga Award in the &quot;shōnen&quot; category in 2004. When the second anime adaptation was reaching its ending, Arakawa showed director Yasuhiro Irie her plans for the manga&#x27;s ending, making both end in near dates. Most reviewers distinguish between the manga and anime, which they attribute to differences in style and subject matter. One review explains that the manga is more &quot;emotional,&quot; whereas the anime is more whimsical. Arakawa&#x27;s simple, dark style and plot choices contrast with the anime&#x27;s &quot;cartoony,&quot; colorful rendering. Reviews in general tend to ascribe the anime to children and the manga to teens and adults.

Arakawa is married with three children. She gave birth to a daughter in 2007 and had her third child in January 2014.

She is currently living in Tokyo and has published more works, including &quot;Raiden-18&quot;, &quot;Sōten no Kōmori&quot; (also known as &quot;Bat in Blue Sky&quot;), and &quot;Hero Tales&quot;. Arakawa has collaborated with the creation of &quot;Hero Tales&quot; with Studio Flag under the name of Huang Jin Zhou. In the anime adaptation of the series, Arakawa was responsible for the character designs. She has also drawn the cover from the Japanese edition of the novel &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Lexicon&quot; authored by Sarah Rees Brennan.

In April 2011, Arakawa began a series called &quot;Silver Spoon&quot; in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. Rather than writing another fantasy series like &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, Arakawa wanted to challenge herself by trying a more realistic story with &quot;Silver Spoon&quot;. It quickly rose among Shogakukan&#x27;s best-selling titles and an anime series by A-1 Pictures began airing in July 2013. Also in July 2013 she began her manga adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka&#x27;s &quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan&quot; series of novels in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine&quot;.

Arakawa started the manga series &quot;Daemons of the Shadow Realm&quot; in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; on December 10, 2021.

==Influences==
Arakawa states that Suihō Tagawa, the author of &quot;Norakuro&quot;, is the &quot;root of [her] style as an artist&quot;. She also learned composition and drawing during her time as assistant of . She also cites Rumiko Takahashi, Shigeru Mizuki, and &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; by Yudetamago as influences and is a fan of Mike Mignola&#x27;s work. Reviewers consider &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; to have steampunk influences.

<text>General [[Nawab]] Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan V Abbasi (; 29 September 1904 – 24 May 1966) was the 12th and final Nawab (&quot;ruler&quot;) of the state of Bahawalpur from February 1907 to October 1955, and then as a titular figure until his death in 1966.

He became the Nawab on the death of his father when he was only two years old. A Council of Regency, with Sir Rahim Bakhsh as its president, ruled on his behalf until 1924.

The Nawab served as an officer with the British Indian Army, fighting in the Third Afghan War (1919) and commanding forces in the Middle East during the Second World War. By 1947, its institutions consisted of departments run by trained civil servants; there was a Ministerial Cabinet headed by a prime minister; the State Bank was the Bank of Bahawalpur, with branches outside the State, including Karachi, Lahore. There was a High Court and there were lower courts, as well as a trained police force and an army commanded by officers trained at the Royal Indian Military Academy at Dehra Doon. The Nawab had a keen interest in education, which was free till A level and the state&#x27;s government provided scholarships of merit for higher education. In 1951, the Nawab donated 500 acres in Bahawalpur for the construction of Sadiq Public School. Nawab was known for his relationship with the Quaid-i-Azam (Muhammad Ali Jinnah), Founder of Pakistan.

In August 1947, on the withdrawal of British forces from the British India, the Nawab decided not to accede his State at once to the new Dominion of Pakistan. However, on 3 October 1947, after some delay, he relented and became the first ruler of a princely state (Bahawalpur) to accede successfully.

As tens of thousands of Muslim refugees flooded into the state from the new India, he set up the Ameer of Bahawalpur Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Fund to provide for their relief. In 1953, the Ameer represented Pakistan at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In 1955, he signed an agreement with the governor-general of Pakistan, Malik Ghulam Muhammad, under which Bahawalpur became part of the province of West Pakistan, with effect from 14 October 1955, and the Amir received a yearly privy purse of 32 lakhs of rupees, keeping his titles. The same year, he was promoted to the rank of general in the Pakistan Army.

==Early life==
Sir Sadeq Muhammad Khan Abbasi was born at Derawar on 29 September 1904, the only son and heir of Haji Nawab Muhammad Bahawal Khan Abbasi V, Nawab of the state of Bahawalpur. When only two and a half, his father fell ill and died while at sea off the Aden coast, on 15 February 1907, leaving Sadeq as ruler of Bahawalpur. He was educated at Aitchison College, Lahore. At the age of 15, Sadeq fought in the Third Afghan War in 1919, was knighted in 1922 when he reached his majority and was invested with the throne two years later by the Viceroy of India, Rufus Isaacs, Lord Reading.

In 1929, he visited Egypt and was a guest of King Fuad I. Very fond of cars, he bought a Rolls-Royce Phantom car, 45WR, body by Thrupp &amp; Maberly, one of the two Cars on display at the Cairo Show.

His last wife was Linda Sayce, a British citizen. The couple had three sons.

==Ruler of Bahawalpur==
The Bahawalpur State under his rule was considered to be an important sovereign state in Punjab. The Bahawalpur State had a special privilege as it was larger than some states of the present time . Its rulers also enjoyed special protocol and titles conferred by the British since 1866 as they were accorded 17 guns salute and had special access to the Viceroy of British India. Bahawalpur state also had a separate mint to cast coins for its public and the facility remained intact until 1940. The British Government established a Regency Council under the supervision of Maulvi Sir Rahim Bakhsh until the minor Nawab grew up as a young man. This council was responsible for state administration. Special attention was paid to the education and upbringing of Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan. He started his education at a college in Lahore and completed it in England. He had an aptitude for military affairs and achieved several military titles, conferred on him by the British Empire. The Viceroy of India, Lord Reading awarded total authority of the state administration to Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan (V) on 8 March 1924.

Sir Sadiq continued his military career in the British Indian Army, which he had begun as a Lieutenant in 1921; by 1932 he was a Major, by 1941 a Lieutenant-Colonel, commanding troops in the Middle East during the Second World War. Since 1933, he had also been a Member of the Chamber of Princes, and since 1940, a member of the Indian Defence Council. Promoted to major general in 1946, the following year, on 15 August 1947, Sir Sadeq was promoted to the title of Amir of Bahawalpur. He acceded to the Dominion of Pakistan a month later.

From the 1930s Sir Sadiq began regularly holidaying in England, purchasing Ardene and the surrounding woodland on the outskirts of Farnham, Surrey. During World War II, this was given over to the community and used as a children&#x27;s nursery until the end of the war. He then resumed his annual holiday, moving to Selham House near Chichester in 1948.

In 1956, following the concept of Aitchison college, he laid the foundation stone of the largest school of Asia in Bahawalpur namely Sadiq Public School.

==Later life and death==
After the partition of India Nawab proved to be very helpful and generous to the government of Pakistan. He gave seventy million rupees to the government and the salaries of all the government departments for one month were also drawn from the treasury of Bahawalpur state. He gave his private property to the University of the Punjab, King Edward Medical College and the Mosque of Aitchison College, Lahore.

At the time of partition, all the princely states of the subcontinent were given the choice of joining Pakistan or India or remaining independent. To try to convince the Nawab to join India, Pandit Nehru went to him while he was in London and offered various incentives in this regard, but he did not accept them. On 5 October 1947, he signed an Instrument of Accession with the government of Pakistan, for Bahawalpur State to accede to Pakistan. Thus the State of Bahawalpur was the first of the states that joined Pakistan.

The main factor was the Islamic sentiments of the Muslims who were in the majority in Bahawalpur. Moreover, the Nawab and Quaid-i-Azam were close friends and they had great respect for each other, even before the creation of Pakistan. The Amir of Bahawalpur Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Fund was instituted in 1947 for providing a central organization for the relief of refugees fleeing from the new India, and the Quaid acknowledged the valuable contribution of the Bahawalpur State for the rehabilitation of the refugees.

In 1953, Sir Sadiq represented Pakistan at the installation of Faisal II of Iraq and also at the coronation of Elizabeth II, who was also the Queen of Pakistan. In 1955, an accord was signed between Sadiq Mohammad and Governor-General Malik Ghulam Muhammad, according to which the State of Bahawalpur would become part of the province of West Pakistan and the Nawab was to receive a yearly stipend, or privy purse, of 32 lakhs of rupees and was to keep the title of Nawab and its precedence both inside and outside Pakistan.

In May 1966, Nawab Sadiq died in London, which ended his long 59 years as Nawab and Amir of Bahawalpur; his body was brought back to Bahawalpur and was buried in his family&#x27;s ancestral graveyard at Derawar Fort. His eldest son Nawab Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi succeeded to his father&#x27;s title of Nawab of Bahawalpur. Another son, Saeed-ur-Rashid Abbasi was a Federal Minister of the Government of Pakistan. Sir Sadiq&#x27;s grandson Nawab Salahuddin Ahmed Abbasi currently holds the title of Nawab.

His descendants of the royal house include: his heir apparent, Nawab Brig. Muhammad Abbas Khan Abbasi (former Governor of Punjab); his grandchildren Nawab Salahuddin Ahmed Abbasi (Urdu: نواب صلاح الدین عباسی‬) who is a Member of Parliament in Pakistan, Prince Falahuddin Abbasi (who died in London in April 2016, from cancer), Princess Aiysha Yasmien Abbasi and Princess Safia Nausheen Abbasi.

<text>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), also known as estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists (ERAAs), are a class of drugs that act on estrogen receptors (ERs). Compared to pure ER agonists–antagonists (e.g., full agonists and silent antagonists), SERMs are more tissue-specific, allowing them to selectively inhibit or stimulate estrogen-like action in various tissues.

== Medical uses ==
SERMs are used for various estrogen-related diseases, including treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in the management of infertility treatment, prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment and risk reduction of breast cancer, and treatment of dyspareunia due to menopause. SERMs are also used in combination with conjugated estrogens indicated for the management of estrogen deficiency symptoms and of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

SERMs are also being explored for gender-affirming hormone therapy in some non-binary transgender individuals that were assigned male at birth. Unlike pure estrogen receptor agonists like estradiol which cause the broad development of feminine secondary sex characteristics, SERMs can be used to achieve partial feminization in individuals who wish to develop certain feminine traits such as softer skin and feminine body fat distribution without significant breast growth. Unlike bioidentical estrogens, SERMs themselves do not suppress testosterone and therefore are used alongside antiandrogens. The use of SERMs for gender-affirming hormone therapy is still relatively new and uncommon as there is limited research into their efficacy and safety when used long-term. 

==Examples==

Tamoxifen is a first-line hormonal treatment for ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. It is used for breast cancer risk reduction in women at high risk, and as adjuvant treatment for axillary node-negative and node-positive ductal carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot;. Tamoxifen treatment is also used for the treatment of osteoporosis and blood lipids in postmenopausal women. Adverse effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes and an increase in the risk of developing endometrial cancer compared to women of similar age.

Toremifene, a chlorinated tamoxifen derivative developed to avoid hepatic carcinomas, was associated with fewer DNA adducts in the liver than tamoxifen in preclinical studies. It is used as endocrine therapy for women with estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive, stage 4 or recurrent metastatic breast cancer and has demonstrated similar efficacy compared to tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Raloxifene is used for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and breast cancer prevention in high-risk postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Preclinical and clinical reports suggest that it is considerably less potent than estrogen for the treatment of osteoporosis. It is associated with an acceptable endometrial profile and has not demonstrated tamoxifen-like effects on the uterus, but has been associated with adverse effects such as venous thromboembolism and vasomotor symptoms, including hot flushes.

Ospemifene is an analogous metabolite of toremifene. Unlike tamoxifen, toremifene is not a rat hepatocarcinogen, and therefore ospemifene would also be a safer SERM than tamoxifen. It is used for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. Clinical data on breast cancer are not available, but both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; data suggest that ospemifene may have chemopreventive activity in breast tissue.

Bazedoxifene is used for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. It has been shown to be relatively safe and well-tolerated. It shows no breast or endometrial stimulation and in the first two years the small increase is better in venous thromboembolism, and similar in the long term to other SERMs. The advantage of bazedoxifene over raloxifene is that it increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and does not antagonize the effect of 17β-estradiol on vasomotor symptoms.

The first tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) combines conjugated estrogens and the SERM bazedoxifene to blend their activities. The combination therapy is used in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis as well as treatment of estrogen deficiency symptoms in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women. The combination allows for the benefits of estrogen with regard to relief of vasomotor symptoms without estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium.

SERMs have also been used in hormone replacement therapy by some transgender people.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

SERMs are competitive partial agonists of the ER. Different tissues have different degrees of sensitivity to the activity of endogenous estrogens, so SERMs produce estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects depending on the tissue in question, as well as the percentage of intrinsic activity (IA) of the SERM. An example of a SERM with high IA and thus mostly estrogenic effects is chlorotrianisene, while an example of a SERM with low IA and thus mostly antiestrogenic effects is ethamoxytriphetol. SERMs like clomifene and tamoxifen are comparatively more in the middle in their IA and their balance of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity. Raloxifene is a SERM that is more antiestrogenic than tamoxifen; both are estrogenic in bone, but raloxifene is antiestrogenic in the uterus while tamoxifen is estrogenic in this part of the body.

==== Binding site ====

SERM act on the estrogen receptor (ER), which is an intracellular, ligand-dependent transcriptional activator and belongs to the nuclear receptor family. Two different subtypes of ER have been identified, ERα and ERβ. ERα is considered the main medium where estrogen signals are transduced at the transcriptional level and is the predominant ER in the female reproductive tract and mammary glands while ERβ is primarily in vascular endothelial cells, bone, and male prostate tissue. ERα and ERβ concentration are known to be different in tissues during development, aging or disease state. Many characteristics are similar between these two types such as size (~600 and 530 amino acids) and structure. ERα and ERβ share approximately 97% of the amino-acid sequence identity in the DNA-binding domain and about 56% in the ligand-binding domain. The main difference of the ligand-binding domains is determined by Leu-384 and Met-421 in ERα, which are replaced by Met-336 and Ile-373, respectively, in ERβ. The variation is greater on the N-terminus between ERα and ERβ.

DNA-binding domain consists of two subdomains. One with a proximal box that is involved in DNA recognition while the other contains a distal box responsible for DNA-dependent, DNA-binding domain dimerization. The proximal box sequence is identical between ERα and ERβ, which indicates similar specificity and affinity between the two subgroups. DNA-binding domain&#x27;s globular proteins contain eight cysteines and allow for a tetrahedral coordination of two zinc ions. This coordination makes the binding of ER to estrogen response elements possible. The ligand-binding domain is a globular, three-layered structure made of 11 helixes and contains a pocket for the natural or synthetic ligand. Influencing factors for binding affinity are mainly the presence of a phenol moiety, molecular size and shape, double bonds and hydrophobicity.

The differential positioning of the activating function 2 (AF-2) helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain by the bound ligand determines whether the ligand has an agonistic and antagonistic effect. In agonist-bound receptors, helix 12 is positioned adjacent to helices 3 and 5. Helices 3, 5, and 12 together form a binding surface for an NR box motif contained in coactivators with the canonical sequence LXXLL (where L represents leucine or isoleucine and X is any amino acid). Unliganded (apo) receptors or receptors bound to antagonist ligands turn helix 12 away from the LXXLL-binding surface that leads to preferential binding of a longer leucine-rich motif, LXXXIXXX(I/L), present on the corepressors NCoR1 or SMRT. In addition, some cofactors bind to ER through the terminals, the DNA-binding site or other binding sites. Thus, one compound can be an ER agonist in a tissue rich in coactivators but an ER antagonist in tissues rich in corepressors.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Estrogenic compounds span a spectrum of activity, including:
* Full agonists (agonistic in all tissues), such as the natural endogenous hormone estradiol.
* Mixed agonists/antagonistic (agonistic in some tissues while antagonistic in others), such as tamoxifen (a SERM).
* Pure antagonists (antagonistic in all tissues), such as fulvestrant.

SERMs are known to stimulate estrogenic actions in tissues such as the liver, bone and cardiovascular system but known to block estrogen action where stimulation is not desirable, such as in the breast and the uterus. This agonistic or antagonistic activity causes varied structural changes of the receptors, which results in activation or repression of the estrogen target genes. SERMs interact with receptors by diffusing into cells and their binding to ERα or ERβ subunits, which results in dimerization and structural changes of the receptors. This makes it easier for the SERMs to interact with estrogen response elements which leads to the activation of estrogen-inducible genes and mediating the estrogen effects.

SERMs unique feature is their tissue- and cell-selective activity. There is growing evidence to support that SERM activity is mainly determined by selective recruitment of corepressors and coactivators to ER target genes in specific types of tissues and cells. SERMs can impact coactivator protein stability and can also regulate coactivator activity through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Multiple growth signaling pathways, such as HER2, PKC, PI3K and more, are downregulated in response to anti-estrogen treatment. Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) is phosphorylated by activated kinases that also enhance its coactivator activity, affect cell growth and ultimately contribute to drug resistance.

The ratio of ERα and ERβ at a target site may be another way SERM activity is determined. High levels of cellular proliferation correlate well with a high ERα:ERβ ratio, but repression of cellular proliferation correlates to ERβ being dominant over ERα. The ratio of ERs in neoplastic and normal breast tissue could be important when considering chemoprevention with SERMs.

When looking at the differences between ERα and ERβ, Activating Function 1 (AF-1) and AF-2 are important. Together they play an important part in the interaction with other co-regulatory proteins that control gene transcription. AF-1 is located in the amino terminus of the ER and is only 20% homologous in ERα and ERβ. On the other hand, AF-2 is very similar in ERα and ERβ, and only one amino acid is different. Studies have shown that by switching AF-1 regions in ERα and ERβ, that there are specific differences in transcription activity. Generally, SERMs can partially activate engineered genes through ERα by an estrogen receptor element, but not through ERβ. Although, raloxifene and the active form of tamoxifen can stimulate AF-1-regulated reporter genes in both ERα and ERβ.

Because of the discovery that there are two ER subtypes, it has brought about the synthesis of a range of receptor specific ligands that can switch on or off a particular receptor. However, the external shape of the resulting complex is what becomes the catalyst for changing the response at a tissue target to a SERM.

X-ray crystallography of estrogens or antiestrogens has shown how ligands program the receptor complex to interact with other proteins. The ligand-binding domain of the ER demonstrates how ligands promote and prevent coactivator binding based on the shape of the estrogen or antiestrogen complex. The broad range of ligands that bind to the ER can create a spectrum of ER complexes that are fully estrogenic or antiestrogenic at a specific target site. The main result of a ligand-binding to ER is a structural rearrangement of the ligand-binding pocket, primarily in the AF-2 of the C-terminal region. The binding of ligands to ER leads to the formation of a hydrophobic pocket that regulates cofactors and receptor pharmacology. The correct folding of ligand-binding domain is required for activation of transcription and for ER to interact with a number of coactivators.

Coactivators are not just protein partners that connect sites together in a complex. Coactivators play an active role in modifying the activity of a complex. Post-translation modification of coactivators can result in a dynamic model of steroid hormone action by way of multiple kinase pathways initiated by cell surface growth factor receptors. Under the guidance of a multitude of protein remodelers to form a multiprotein coactivator complex that can interact with the phosphorylated ER at a specific gene promoter site, the core coactivator first has to recruit a specific set of cocoactivators. The proteins that the core coactivator assembles as the core coactivated complex have individual enzymatic activities to methylate or acetylate adjacent proteins. The ER substrates or coenzyme A can be polyubiquitinated by multiple cycles of the reaction or, depending on linkage proteins, they can either be activated further or degraded by the 26S proteasome.

Consequently, to have an effective gene transcription that is programmed and targeted by the structure and phosphorylation status of the ER and coactivators, it is required to have a dynamic and cyclic process of remodeling capacity for transcriptional assembly, after which the transcription complex is then instantly routinely destroyed by the proteasome.

== Structure and function ==

=== Structure–activity relationships ===
The core structure of SERMs simulates the 17β-estradiol template. They have two aromatic rings separated by 1-3 atoms (often a stilbene-type of arrangement). Between the two phenyls of the core, SERMs typically have a 4-substituted phenyl group that, when bound to ER, projects from a position of an estratriene nucleus so that helix 12 moves from the receptor opening and blocks the space where coactivator proteins would normally bind and cause ER agonist activity. There has been a lot of variations in the core portion of SERMs while there has been less flexibility with what is tolerated in the side chain. SERMs can be classified by their core structure.

==== First-generation triphenylethylenes ====

The first main structural class of SERM-type molecules reported are the triphenylethylenes. The stilbene core (similar to the nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstilbestrol) essentially mimics steroidal estrogens such as 17β-estradiol, while the side chain overlays with the 11th position of the steroid nucleus. Triphenylethylene derivatives have an additional phenyl group attached to the ethylene bridge group. The 3-position H-bonding ability of phenols is a significant requirement for ER binding.
The first drug, clomifene, has a chloro-substituent on the ethylene side chain which produces similar binding affinities as the later discovered drug tamoxifen. Clomifene is a mixture of estrogenic (cis-form) and antiestrogenic isomers (trans-form). Cis and trans are defined in terms of the geometric relationships of the two unsubstituted phenyl rings. The two isomers of clomifene have different profiles, where the trans-form has activity more similar to tamoxifen while the cis-form behaves more like 17β-estradiol. Cis is approximately ten times more potent than trans. However, trans isomer is the most potent stimulator of epithelial cell hypertrophy since clomifene is antagonistic at low doses and agonistic at high doses. The antagonist isomers may cause inhibitory estrogenic effects in the uterus and mammary cancers, but the estrogenic isomer could combine with novel receptors to produce estrogen-like effects in bone.

Tamoxifen has become the treatment of choice for women diagnosed with all stages of hormone-responsive breast cancer, that is, breast cancer that is both ER and/or progesterone positive. In the US, it is also administered for prophylactic chemoprevention in women identified as high risk for breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a pure antiestrogenic trans-isomer and has differential actions at estrogen target tissues throughout the body. Tamoxifen is selectively antiestrogenic in the breast but estrogen-like in bones and endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen undergo phase I metabolism in the liver by microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The major metabolites of tamoxifen are &quot;N&quot;-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

The crystallographic structure of 4-hydroxytamoxifen interacts with the amino acids of the ER within the ligand-binding domain. The contact between the phenolic group, water molecule, and glutamate and arginine in the receptor (ERα; Glu 353/Arg 394) resolves in high affinity binding so that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, with a phenolic ring that resembles the A ring of 17β-estradiol, has more than 100 times higher relative binding affinity than tamoxifen, which has no phenol. If its OH group is eliminated or its position is changed the binding affinity is reduced.

The triphenylethylene moiety and the side chain are required for tamoxifen binding to the ER, whereas for 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the side chain, and the phenyl-propene do not appear as crucial structural elements for binding to the ER. The basicity and length of the side chain do not seem to play a crucial role for tamoxifen binding affinity to the ER nor the β-ring of tamoxifen, but the stilbene moiety of tamoxifen is necessary for binding to the ER. The hydroxyl group is of particular importance for ER binding of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and the ethyl side chain of tamoxifen protrudes out of the ligand-binding domain of the ER.

Few tamoxifen users have had increased rates of uterine cancer, hot flushes, and thromboembolisms. The drug can also cause hepatocarcinomas in rats. This is likely due to the ethyl group of the tamoxifen stilbene core that is subject to allylic oxidative activation causing DNA alkylation and strand scission. This problem is later corrected in toremifene. Tamoxifen is more promiscuous than raloxifene in target sites because of the relationship between ER&#x27;s amino acid in Asp-351 and the antiestrogenic side chain of the SERM. The side chain for tamoxifen cannot neutralize Asp-351, so the site allosterically influences AF-1 at the proximal end of the ER. This issue is mended with the second-generation drug raloxifene.

Toremifene is a chlorinated derivative of the nonsteroidal triphenylethylene antiestrogen tamoxifen with a chloro substituent at the ethylene side chain producing similar binding affinities to that of tamoxifen. The structure and activity relationship of toremifene is similar to that of tamoxifen, but it has a substantial improvement from the older drug in regards to DNA alkylation. The presence of the added chlorine atom reduces the stability of cations formed from activated allylic metabolites and thus decreases alkylation potential, and indeed toremifene does not display DNA adduct formation in rodent hepatocytes. Toremifene protects against bone loss in ovariectomized rat models and affects bone resorption markers clinically in a similar fashion to tamoxifen. Toremifene undergoes phase I metabolism by microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, like tamoxifen, but primarily by the CYP3A4 isoform. Toremifene forms its two major metabolites N-desmethyltoremifene and deaminohydroxy-toremifene (ospemifene) by undergoing N-demethylation and deamination-hydroxylation. N-desmethyltoremifene has similar efficacy as toremifene while 4-hydroxytoremifene has a higher binding affinity to the ER than toremifene. 4-hydroxytoremifene has a role similar to that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

==== Second-generation benzothiophenes ====
Raloxifene belongs to the second-generation benzothiophene SERM drugs. It has a high affinity for the ER with potent antiestrogenic activity and tissue-specific effects distinct from estradiol. Raloxifene is an ER agonist in bone and the cardiovascular system, but in breast tissue and the endometrium it acts as an ER antagonist. It is extensively metabolized by glucuronide conjugation in the gut and because of that has a low bioavailability of only 2% while that of tamoxifen and toremifene is approximately 100%.

The advantage of raloxifene over the triphenylethylene tamoxifen is reduced effect on the uterus. The flexible hinge group, as well as the antiestrogenic phenyl 4-piperidinoethoxy side chain, are important for minimizing uterine effects. Because of its flexibility the side chain can obtain an orthogonal disposition relative to the core so that the amine of raloxifene side chain is 1 Å closer than tamoxifens to amino acid Asp-351 in ERα&#x27;s ligand-binding domain.

The critical role of the intimate relationship between the hydrophobic side chain of raloxifene and the hydrophobic residue of the receptor to change both the shape and charge of the external surface of a SERM-ER complex has been confirmed with raloxifene derivatives. When the interactive distance between raloxifene and Asp-351 is increased from 2.7 Å to 3.5-5 Å it causes increased estrogen-like action of the raloxifene-ERα complex. When the piperidine ring of raloxifene is replaced by cyclohexane, the ligand loses antiestrogenic properties and becomes a full agonist. The interaction between SERM&#x27;s antiestrogenic side chain and amino acid Asp-351 is the important first step in silencing AF-2. It relocates helix 12 away from the ligand-binding pocket thereby preventing coactivators from binding to the SERM-ER complex.

==== Third-generation ====

Third-generation compounds display either no uterine stimulation, improved potency, no significant increases in hot flushes or a combination of these attributes.

The first dihydronapthalene SERM, nafoxidine, was a clinical candidate for the treatment of breast cancer but had side effects including severe phototoxicity. Nafoxidine has all three phenyls constrained in a coplanar arrangement like tamoxifen. But with hydrogenation, the double bond of nafoxidene were reduced, and both phenyls are cis-oriented. The amine-bearing side chain can then adopt an axial conformation and locate this group orthogonally to the plane of the core, like ralofoxifene and other less uterotropic SERMs.

Modifications of nafoxidine resulted in lasofoxifene. Lasofoxifene is among the most potent SERMs reported in protection against bone loss and cholesterol reduction. The excellent oral potency of lasofoxifene has been attributed to reduced intestinal glucuronidation of the phenol. Unlike raloxifene, lasofoxifene satisfies the requirement of a pharmacophore model that predicts resistance to gut wall glucuronidation. The structural requirement is a non-planar topology with the steric bulk close to the plane of a fused bicyclic aromatic system. The interactions between the ER and lasofoxifene are consistent with the general features of SERM-ER recognition. Lasofoxifene&#x27;s large flexible side chain terminates in a pyrrolidine head group and threads its way out toward the surface of the protein, where it interferes directly with the positioning of the AF-2 helix. A salt bridge forms between lasofoxifene and Asp-351. The charge neutralization in this region ER may explain some antiestrogenic effects exerted by lasofoxifene.

The indole system has served as a core unit in SERMs, and when an amine is attached to the indole with a benzyloxyethyl, the resultant compounds were shown to have no preclinical uterine activity while sparing rat bone with full efficacy at low doses. Bazedoxifene is one of those compounds. The core binding domain consists of a 2-phenyl-3-methyl indole and a hexamethylenamine ring at the side chain affecter region. It is metabolized by glucuronidation, with the absolute bioavailability of 6.2%, 3-fold higher than that of raloxifene. It has agonistic effects on bone and lipid metabolism but not on breast and uterine endometrium. It is well tolerated and displays no increase in hot flush , uterine hypertrophy or breast tenderness.

Ospemifene is a triphenylethylene and a known metabolite of toremifene. It&#x27;s structurally very similar to tamoxifen and toremifene. Ospemifene does not have 2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy group as tamoxifen. Structure–activity relationship studies showed that by removing that group of tamoxifen agonistic activity in the uterus was significantly reduced, but not in bone and cardiovascular system. Preclinical and clinical data show that ospemifene is well tolerated with no major side effects. Benefits that ospemifene may have over other SERMs is its neutral effect on hot flushes and ER-agonist effect on the vagina, improving the symptoms of vaginal dryness.

=== Binding modes ===
The SERMs are known to feature four distinctive modes of binding to ER. One of those features are strong hydrogen bonds between the ligand and ERα&#x27;s Arg-394 and Glu-353 that line the &quot;A-ring pocket&quot; and help the ligand to stay in ER&#x27;s binding pocket. This is unlike 17β-estradiol which is hydrogen bonded to His-524 in the &quot;D-ring pocket&quot;. Other distinctive bindings to the ligand-binding pocket are with a nearly planar &quot;core&quot; structure typically composed of a biaryl heterocycle, equivalent to the A-ring and B-ring of 17β-estradiol, to the corresponding binding site; a bulky side chain from the biaryl structure, analogous to the B-ring of 17β-estradiol and finally a second side group that is the C- and D-ring equivalent and usually aromatic, fills the remainder volume of the ligand-binding pocket.

The small differences between the two subtypes of ER have been used to develop subtype-selective ER modulators, but the high similarity between the two receptors make the development very challenging. Amino acids in the ligand-binding domains differ at two positions, Leu-384 and Met-421 in ERα and Met-336 and Ile-373 in ERβ, but they have similar hydrophobicity and occupying volumes. However, the shapes and the rotational barrier of the amino acid residues are not the same, leading to distinguish α- and β-face of the binding cavity between ERα and ERβ. This causes ERα-preferential-binding of ligand substituents that are aligned downwards facing Met-336 while ligand substituents aligned upwards facing Met-336 are more likely to bind to ERβ. Another difference is in Val-392 in ERα, which is replaced by Met-344 in ERβ. ERβ&#x27;s binding pocket volume is slightly smaller and the shape a bit different from ERα&#x27;s. Many ERβ-selective ligands have a largely planar arrangement as the binding cavity of ERβ is slightly narrower than that of ERα, however, this by itself leads to modest selectivity. To attain strong selectivity, the ligand must place substituents very close to one or more of the amino acid differences between ERα and ERβ in order to create a strong repulsive force towards the other subtype receptor. In addition, the structure of the ligand must be rigid. Repulsive interactions may otherwise lead to the conformational change of the ligand and, therefore, create alternative binding modes.

==== First-generation triphenylethylenes ====
Tamoxifen is converted by the liver cytochrome P450 into the 4-hydroxytamoxifen and is a more selective antagonist of the ERα subtype than ERβ. 4-hydroxytamoxifen binds to ERs within the same binding pocket that recognizes 17β-estradiol. The receptor recognition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen appears to be controlled by two structural features of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the phenolic A ring, and the bulky side chain. The phenolic A ring forms hydrogen bonds to the side groups of ER&#x27;s Arg-394, Glu-354 and to structurally conserved water. The bulky side chain, protruding from the binding cavity, displaces helix 12 from ligand-binding pocket to cover part of the coactivator binding pocket. The ER-4-hydroxytamoxifen complex formation recruits corepressors proteins. This leads to decreased DNA synthesis and inhibition of estrogen activity. Clomifene and torimefene produce binding affinities similar to that of tamoxifen. Thus, these two drugs are more selective antagonists of the ERα subtype than ERβ.

==== Second-generation benzothiophenes ====
Raloxifene, like 4-hydroxytamoxifen, binds to ERα with the hydroxyl group of its phenolic &quot;A ring&quot; through hydrogen bonds with Arg-394 and Glu-353. In addition to these bonds, raloxifene forms a second hydrogen bond to ER through the side group of His-524 because of the presence of a second hydroxyl group in the &quot;D ring&quot;. This hydrogen bond is also unlike that between 17β-estradiol and His-524, as the imidazole ring of His-524 is rotated to counteract the difference of the oxygen position in raloxifene and in 17β-estradiol. Just like in 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the bulky side chain of raloxifene displaces helix 12.

==== Third-generation ====
Lasofoxifene interaction with ERα is typical of those between SERM-ERα such as a nearly planar topology (the tetrahydronapthalene carbocycle), hydrogen bonding with Arg-394 and Glu-353 and the phenyl side chains of lasofoxifene filling the C-ring and D-ring volume of the ligand-binding pocket. Lasofoxifene diverts helix 12 and prevents the binding of coactivator proteins with LXXLL motives. This is achieved by lasofoxifene occupying the space normally filled by Leu-540&#x27;s side group and modulating the conformation of residues of helix 11 (His-524, Leu-525). Furthermore, lasofoxifene also directly interferes with helix 12 positioning by the drug&#x27;s ethyl pyrrolidine group. In vitro studies indicate that bazedoxifene competitively blocks 17β-estradiol by high and similar binding to both ERα and ERβ. Bazedoxifenes main binding domain consists of the 2-phenyl-3-methylindole and a hexamethylenamine ring at the side chain affected region.

Ospemifene is an oxidative deaminated metabolite of toremifene as has a similar binding to ER as toremifene and tamoxifen. The competitive binding to ERα and ERβ of the three metabolites 4-hydroxy Ospemifene, 4&#x27;-hydroxy Ospemifene and the 4-hydroxy-, side chain carboxylic acid Ospemifene is at least as high as the parent compound.

== History ==

The discovery of SERMs resulted from attempts to develop new contraceptives. Clomifene and tamoxifen prevented conception in rats but did the opposite in humans. Clomifene successfully induced ovulation in subfertile women and on February 1, 1967, it was approved in the US for the treatment of ovulation dysfunction in women who were trying to conceive. Toxicological issues prevented long term use of clomifene and further drug development for other potential applications such as breast cancer treatment and prevention.

It was another ten years before tamoxifen was approved in December 1977, not as a contraceptive but as a hormonal treatment to treat and prevent breast cancer. The discovery in 1987 that the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene, then thought to be antiestrogens because of antagonist effects in breast tissue, showed estrogenic effects in preventing bone loss in ovariectomized rats had a great effect on our understanding of the function of estrogen receptors and nuclear receptors in general. The term SERM was introduced to describe these compounds that have a combination of estrogen agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist activities depending on the tissue. Toremifene has been shown to be compatible with tamoxifen, and in 1996 it was approved for use in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Raloxifene originally failed as a breast cancer drug due to its poor performance in comparison to tamoxifen in the laboratory but the estrogenic effects of raloxifene on bone led to its rediscovery and approval in 1997. It was approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and was the first clinically available SERM to prevent both osteoporosis and breast cancer. Ospemifene was approved on February 26, 2013, for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, which is a symptom, due to menopause, of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Combined therapy with conjugated estrogens and the SERM bazedoxifene, was approved on October 3, 2013, for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms linked with menopause. Bazedoxifene is also used in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The search for a potent SERM with bone efficacy and better bioavailability than raloxifene led to the discovery of lasofoxifene. Although lasofoxifene was approved in 2009, it was not marketed for three years following the approval, so the marketing authorization for it has expired. In Europe, bazedoxifene is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. In India, ormeloxifene has been used for dysfunctional uterine bleeding and birth control.

<text>Mohammad Bahawal Khan V (1883–1907) was the 11th Nawab of the Kingdom of Bahawalpur, a former princely state of the British Raj, now part of Pakistan. He ruled from 1899 until his death. As Nawab of Bahawalpur, he was entitled to a 17-gun salute.

==Biography==
Mohammad Bahawal Khan V was the second son by the second wife of Nawab Amir Sir Sadeq Mohammad Khan Abbasi IV Bahadur. In 1899, when he was only fifteen, Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan V ascended the throne of Bahawalpur following his father&#x27;s death. He reigned under a Council of Superintendence until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers in a ceremony attended by the Viceroy, Lord Curzon himself, at Derawar Fort on 12 November 1903.

In 1902 Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan V was invited to London to attend the Coronation of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Westminster Abbey. He set out from Karachi, but on the preliminary voyage to Bombay he suffered so severely from sea sickness that on landing there he cancelled the visit.

On 15 February 1907 Mohammad Bahawal Khan V died of illness on a ship while sailing off the coast of Aden. He was succeeded by his only male heir, Sadeq Mohammad Khan V, who was then only 3 years old.

<text>Lincoln County is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

The county was formed in 1792. In 1845, the southern portion of Lincoln County was separated to form Welland County.

In some census and election records from the late 19th century, the townships of Caistor and Gainsborough (which can be seen on the map below) were enumerated as part of Monck County, while Grantham and Niagara Townships were enumerated as part of Niagara County. However, neither Monck nor Niagara ever existed as incorporated municipal counties, but rather as electoral districts.

In 1970, Lincoln and Welland Counties were amalgamated to form the Regional Municipality of Niagara.

<doc id="1088724" wikidata="Q1646557" url="?curid=1088724" title="Pan Tau">
<text>Pan Tau (Czech for &quot;Mr. Tau&quot;) is a character created for a children&#x27;s television series. There were 33 episodes in 3 series made by the Czechoslovak Television (ČST) in cooperation with Barrandov Studios and the West German TV network Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR). A pilot film was shot in 1966, and 33 episodes were made from 1970 until 1979. The project ended with a feature film in 1988.

The protagonist Pan Tau, who generally didn&#x27;t speak and communicated through pantomime, was played by Otto Šimánek (1925–1992). The series was written by Ota Hofman and directed by Jindřich Polák. The plot of each episode was generally comical but contained some kind of problem for a child, and here Pan Tau found the way to solve the problem.

Pan Tau always had a gentle expression and a friendly smile, he was elegantly dressed in a stroller, with an umbrella and a white carnation in the lapel. Foremost, he was famous for his magic bowler hat. By tapping on his hat, Pan Tau was able to change his appearance into a puppet, to conjure up miscellaneous objects or to do other magic. His most characteristic behaviour is that he would help children who were experiencing some sort of difficulties in-between their dreams and reality, like finding a place for skiing, settling family problems on Christmas, and even give a boy a good time at a fair when he is supposed to have piano lessons. To adults, he usually remained invisible.

Although Czechoslovakia then was under a Communist regime, this never was very obvious for the viewers. Pan Tau was a popular children&#x27;s program in several countries at both sides of the Iron Curtain (such as in both West and East Germany and also in the Scandinavian countries), which also appealed to the adult viewers to a certain degree.

Theodor Pištěk designed the costumes for the series.

Ten years after the end of the series, Šimánek again appeared as Pan Tau in a 1988 cinema film. He was also featured in the German singer Nena&#x27;s 1990 music video for &quot;Du bist überall&quot; (&quot;You Are Everywhere&quot;, from her &quot;Wunder gescheh&#x27;n&quot; studio album), which was shot in Prague.

In 2020 a reboot with Matt Edwards as Pan Tau produced by German broadcaster ARD was broadcast.

<text>Welland County (area, excluding cities was 226,970 acres) is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

The county was formed in 1845 from Lincoln County. The county was named from the Welland River. The river got its name from John Graves Simcoe who named it after the River Welland which forms a border of Lincolnshire, England. Niagara Falls, and the Townships in this county were among the earliest settlements in Upper Canada.

In some census and election records from the late 19th century, the townships of Pelham and Wainfleet (which can be seen on the map below) were enumerated as part of Monck County. However, Monck never existed as a county in the political sense, but only as an electoral district.

In 1970, Lincoln and Welland Counties were amalgamated to form the Regional Municipality of Niagara.

== Historic Townships ==

<doc id="1088731" wikidata="Q8532" url="?curid=1088731" title="Külüg Khan">
<text>Külüg Khan (Mongolian: Хүлэг; Mongolian script: ; ), born Khayishan (Mongolian: Хайсан ; , , meaning &quot;wall&quot;), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Wuzong of Yuan () (August 4, 1281 – January 27, 1311), was an emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China. Apart from being the Emperor of China, he is regarded as the seventh Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. His regnal name &quot;Külüg Khan&quot; means &quot;warrior Khan&quot; or &quot;fine horse Khan&quot; in the Mongolian language.

== Early life ==
He was the first son of Darmabala and Dagi of the influential Khunggirad clan, and the full brother of Ayurbarwada. He was sent to Mongolia to assume an army that defended the western front of the Yuan against Kaidu, &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Chagatai Khanate, and other princes in Central Asia under him. In 1289, Khayishan&#x27;s force was nearly routed and the Kipchak commander, Tutugh, rescued him from capture by Kaidu&#x27;s army. In 1301 he clashed with Kaidu, who died from a battle wound. In recognition of the great success, Külüg Khan was given the title of Prince Huaining (懷寧王) in 1304.

When Chapar attacked Duwa, Temür helped the latter and sent an army under Khayishan. In 1306 Khayishan forced Melig Temür, a son of Ariq Böke, who had aligned himself with Kaidu, to accept a surrender in the Altai Mountains and pushed Kaidu&#x27;s successor Chapar westward. For these military achievements he gained a high reputation among Mongol princes and non-Mongol corps. Since his uncle Temür Khan did not have a male heir, he was considered a major candidate for the emperor.

== Enthronement ==
In 1307 when Temür Khan died, Külüg Khan returned eastward to Karakorum and watched the situation. Temür&#x27;s widow Bulugan of the Bayaud tribe had kept away the Khunggirad-mothered brothers of Khayishan and Ayurbarwada and attempted to set up Ananda, a Muslim cousin of Temür, who was the prince of Anxi. Her alliance was supported by some senior officials of the Secretariat under Aqutai, the Chancellor of the Left. They made Bulugan regent and intended to put Ananda on the throne. Ananda was a popular prince who had successfully defended the Yuan against the Ögedeid and Chagatayid armies and had a bulk of the imperial army under him in Anxi. However, he lacked military power in the imperial capital city and was a Muslim, as opposed to the majority of the Yuan Mongols.

The Darkhan Harghasun, Tura, a great-great-grandson of Chagatai Khan, and Yakhutu, a descendant of Tolui, fought for the candidacy of Darmabala&#x27;s sons against them. The pro-Darmabalaid faction arrested Ananda and Bulugan by coup and recalled Ayurbarwada and Dagi from Henan. Then, Khayishan decided to hold the coronation ceremony in Shangdu just as his great-grandfather Kublai Khan did and advanced southward with thirty thousand soldiers from Mongolia. He was welcomed by Ayurbarwada, who gave up emperorship, and ascended to the throne, having executed Ananda and Bulugan prior to his succession. Ariq Böke&#x27;s son, Melig Temür, was also executed because of his support for Ananda.

Khayishan&#x27;s enthronement at Shangdu on June 21, 1307, was performed properly at a kurultai. After that, he made his younger brother Ayurbarwada the heir apparent, and they promised that their descendants would succeed each other in relay.

==Reign==

Soon after Khayishan&#x27;s accession the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiao Jing), one of the works attributed to Confucius, having been translated into the Mongolian language, was distributed throughout the empire. He granted the princes and officials who attended his ceremony lavish gifts in accordance with the amounts set by the previous emperor. Huge amounts, moreover, were spent on the construction of Buddhist temples at Dadu and Shangdu. Fresh honors were decreed to the memory of the old sage, and the characters Da Qing were added to his titles.

His administration was founded on the unstable balance between Khayishan, his younger brother Ayurbarwada and their mother Dagi of the Khunggirad clan. Khayishan appointed Ayurbarwada as Crown Prince on the condition that he would pass the status to Khayishan&#x27;s son after his succession. He generously gave bonuses to imperial princes and Mongol aristocrats and enjoyed popularity among them. Khayishan freely gave away noble and official titles and filled the government with supernumeraries. Having little regard for the unwritten law of Kublai Khan that only the sons of Khagans could be made princes of the first rank, he granted the Genghisids and the non-Borjigins many princely titles. Meanwhile, his administration was plagued with financial difficulties caused by free-spending policies and longstanding military spending, so he brought back the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) for financial affairs in parallel with the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) for administrative affairs. He changed the branch offices of the Central Secretariat to those of the Department of State Affairs to strengthen the monopoly in salt and other goods and issued new bills (Jiaochao) called Zhida-yinchao () to replace Zhiyuan-chao (). His anti-inflation plans did not achieve adequate results in his short reign and dissatisfied Han Chinese officers and commoners. He attempted to push through a new nonconvertible silver currency but was defeated by public resistance.

Although, he first shared with Ayurbarwada the tutorship of the Confucian scholar Li Meng, he apparently was little affected by Confucian culture. He transferred Harghasun to Mongolia as the grand councillor of the left wing of Branch secretariat of Lin-pei despite his great contribution. Khayishan heavily relied on his retainers and commanders he had brought from Mongolia. He gave key posts to them and favored non-Mongol corps including the Kipchak, the Asud (Alans) and the Qanglï. In contrast, he did not reward abundantly the Khunggirad faction who had carried out a coup against Bulughan. Because Tula said something suspicious in rage, Khayishan suspected that he had a further object, and had him tried and put to death.

Khayishan greatly favored Buddhism, so that he ordered the Tibetan Lama Chogdi Osor to translate the sacred books of Buddha. When the Buddhist monks made mistakes except in cases affecting the Yuan dynasty, he refused to punish them. A law was passed that whoever struck a Lama should lose his tongue, but Ayurbarwada repealed it as entirely contrary to precedent. However, Khayishan was the first Khagan to tax the lands held by the Buddhist monks and the followers of Taoism, hitherto exempt.

In order to reduce the cost of supporting the Yuan bureaucracy, he issued an order in 1307 to dismiss the supernumeraries and to bring total number of officials in line with the quota that had been set by his uncle Temür Khan. The order produced no practical results; the number of bureau&#x27;s chief officials jumped from 6 in Kublai&#x27;s reign to 32. He also had the building of court officials and a new palace city built at Dadu and Zhongdu (the ruins of Zhongdu in Zhangbei County can be seen until today).

In 1308 the Goryeo king Chungnyeol of Korea died, and Khayishan sent a patent for his successor Chungseon. That year Chapar and other princes of the Khanate of Ögedei came to Khayishan with their submission, permanently ending the threat against the Chagatai Khanate and the Yuan dynasty by Khaidu&#x27;s sons. During his reign, the Yuan completed the subjugation of Sakhalin, forcing its Ainu people to accept their in 1308.

In 1308, the court made major readjustments in terms of official salaries. Zhiyuan notes would be used instead of Zhongtong notes. The court also abolished the &quot;salary rice&quot; policy decreed by his predecessor, Temür Khan. The Zhida-yinchao became so depreciated in value that in 1309 there was a fresh issue, made to replace that which was the discredited paper, but this also sank rapidly in value, and at length the Emperor, Khaissan, determined upon a recurrence to the ancient money, and accordingly, in 1310, there were struck two kinds of copper coins, having Mongol characters upon them. Some with the inscription, precious money of the Zhida period; and others with this legend, precious money of the Great Yuan. These copper coins were of three sizes: 1 of the value of one li; 2 of the value of ten li; and 3 of coins worth several of those of the dynasties Tang and Song dynasties. Khayishan&#x27;s court encountered financial difficulties. For example, the total government expenditure for the year 1307 was 10 million ting of paper notes and 3 million dan of grains. By 1310, 10,603,100 ting had been borrowed from the reserves for current expenditures. That same year, to address financial difficulties, he reformed the government&#x27;s finances by abolishing the office land system and replacing it with salary rice to support the capital. However, the reform caused widespread dissatisfaction especially among government officials. Local officials without office lands received no rice, and court officials lost their rice altogether due to the cancellation of the salary rice policy.

Tula&#x27;s son Kokechu conspired against the Emperor with the high court officials and Buddhist monks in 1310; but their plans were discovered, the monks were duly executed, and Kokechu was exiled to Korea. Arslan, the governor of Dadu and commander of the kheshig, shared same fate with the conspirators. He was executed with several of his companions.

During Khayishan&#x27;s reign, all Branch Secretariats were renamed Branch Departments of State Affairs. The new major department of state affairs came under Toghta, the grand councillor of the left, Sanpanu and Yueh shi, managers of the government affairs, and Paopa, the assistant administrator of the right.

The selling price of salt licences issued under the state monopoly was raised by 35 percent over the price in 1307. A grain tax surcharge of 2 percent was imposed on the wealthy families of Chiang-nan. The merits of tax collectors were evaluated on the basis of the percentage increase in the taxes they collected the tax quota at the end of Temür&#x27;s reign. To fight against inflation, Khayishan&#x27;s administration established granaries in localities and drastically increased the quota for the maritime shipment of grain from Yangtze valley, reaching 2.9 million shih in 1310. Khayishan reduced the number of chief officials in the Secreatariat, the Censorate, the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the Bureau of Transmission as well as supernumeraries in various offices.

==Death==
After a reign of less than 4 years, Khayishan suddenly died on January 27, 1311. Immediately after his death and Ayurbarwada&#x27;s succession in 1311, the unsatisfactory Khunggirad faction came together under his mother Dagi and purged pro-Khayishan officials. It also broke Ayurbarwada&#x27;s promise to appoint Khayishan&#x27;s son as Crown Prince. His court drove Khayishan&#x27;s sons Kuśala and Tugh Temür out of the central government. Pro-Khayishan generals cherished grievances until they managed to set up Tugh Temür in 1328 after overthrowing another of Khayishan&#x27;s relatives, Ragibagh.

<text>Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) is the state-run media organisation of Kenya. It broadcasts in English and Swahili, as well as in most local languages of Kenya.

The corporation was launched as a radio service in 1928 when Kenya was a British colony, making it the first radio station in Kenya.

The radio station was launched as the East African Broadcasting Corporation (EABC) which relayed BBC News. In 1964, when Kenya became independent, and the corporation&#x27;s name was changed to Voice of Kenya.

In 1989, the Kenyan parliament reverted the corporation&#x27;s name back to Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC).

During the rule of president Daniel arap Moi, KBC became the mouthpiece of the government. Each broadcast opened with a piece on what the president had been doing that day. Under the then president, Mwai Kibaki, KBC took a more objective approach. The corporation helped most of Kenya&#x27;s notable journalists especially before the liberalization of the airwaves in Kenya. The pioneer broadcasters post independence were Maurice Mwendah (TV), Simeon Ndesanjo (Radio), Dalail Mzee (Radio), Aziz Yakub, (Radio &amp; TV), and Aish Jenneby (TV).

English service broadcasters who pioneered the service were Peter Clare, David Kelly, Hassan Mazoa, Sammy Lui, Norbert Okare, and Martin Billy Mutta, followed later by Peter Njoroge Mwaura, Elizabeth Omolo, Esther Kanyago, Yakub Ishaq, Amos Njogu amongst many.

In the 80s and 90s names such as Khamisi Themor, Leornard Mambo Mbotela, Omuga Kabisae, Ngulamu Mwaviro, John Obong&#x27;o Junior and Enacled Araba, were also heard. The English service had its share of KIMC graduates, Serah Kihara, Gladys Erude, John Karani, Wanjiru Kago and Johnstone Omurunga. Opportunities were also accorded to other KBC Technical employees such as Ike Mulembo, William Kiamba, Larry Wambua and others on the English Service.

The modern day KBC boasts of presenters like Rashid Mwamkondo, Cynthia Anyango, Rebecca Cherotich, Beatrice Gatonye, O&#x27; Brien Kimani, Isaac Lemoka, Edward Kabasa, Jeff Mwangemi, Catherine Ndonye, John Karani, Jeff Muya, Nick Ndeda, Ann Lemaiyan. Some of the renown producers include award-winning broadcaster Carolyne Gachacha, Geoffrey Onditi, Julia Wanjiku, Weldon Kirui, Nagayo Nura, Wamoyi Merciella, Ben Kamuti among others.

After many decades of dominance in the Kenyan market, KBC has been overtaken in programming content and ratings, especially with the advent of private TV stations and digital satellite television in the early 2000s. These new platforms brought more content options by airing classic TV shows (sitcoms, action thriller series, weekend movie nights), more children&#x27;s entertainment (more allocation time and wide variety), and more refined local content.

KBC has however fought back and is among the leading stations in Kenya. KBC was particularly praised for being neutral in the coverage of the 2022 general elections. The KBC digital platform is very active and it has given a boost to its traditional media i.e. Radio and Television. The digital department is headed by Jared Ombui who was a presenter at KBC English Service. 
The newly elected government of President William Ruto promised to help KBC to overcome it&#x27;s financial challenges. KBC is expected to be upgraded in parastatal rankings. This is expected to boost morale among its staff.

KBC aired the popular &quot;Vitimbi&quot; comedy and drama show for more than 30 years before the show was taken off air on the national broadcaster in 2015.

<text>A thavil (Tamil:தவில்) or tavil is a barrel-shaped percussion instrument from Tamil Nadu. It is also widely used in other South Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana) as well as in the North and East of Sri Lanka (in the Tamil majority area called Tamil Eelam). It is used in temple, folk and Carnatic music, often accompanying the &quot;nadaswaram&quot;. The &quot;thavil&quot; and the &quot;nadaswaram&quot; are essential components of traditional festivals and ceremonies in South India.

In folk music contexts, a pair of wider, slimmer sticks are sometimes used. Thanjavur is famous for &quot;thavil&quot;, so called &quot;Thanjavur Thavil&quot;. In Tamil Filmi songs thavils are mostly used, Notable movies: &quot;Thillaanaa Mohanambal&quot;, &quot;Paruthiveeran&quot;, &quot;Karagattakaran&quot;, &quot;Sarvam Thaala Mayam&quot;.
== History ==
Thavil is a traditional musical instrument of the ancient city of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. It is an integral part of the Carnatic music in Thanjavur.
It is mostly made in Thanjavur and Valayapatti.

== Physical components ==

The &quot;thavil&quot; consists of a cylindrical shell hollowed out of a solid block of jackfruit wood. Layers of animal skin (water buffalo on the right, goat on the left) are stretched across the two sides of the shell using hemp hoops attached to the shell. The right face of the instrument has a larger diameter than the left side, and the right drum head is stretched very tightly, while the left drum head is kept loose to allow pitch bending. The larger face is higher in pitch than the smaller face.

The modern Thavil has a corpus that is bordered by a steel ring coated in plastic on which the two skins are fixed by metal straps. Both skins can be separately tuned.

== Methods of use and posture ==

The instrument is either played while sitting, or hung by a cloth strap (called &quot;nadai&quot;) from the shoulder of the player. The right head is played with the right hand, wrist and fingers. The player usually wears thumb caps on all the fingers of the right hand, made of hardened glue from maida flour. The left head is played with a short, thick stick made from the wood of the portia tree. It is not uncommon for left-handed players to use the opposite hands, and some nadaswaram groups feature both a right- and a left-handed thavil player.

<text>Öljeyitü Khan (Mongolian: Өлзийт; Mongolian script: &#x27;; ), bornTemür( ; ; 15 October 1265 – 10 February 1307), also known by his [[temple name]] as theEmperor Chengzong of Yuan&quot;&#x27; (), was the second emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China, ruling from 10 May 1294 to 10 February 1307. Apart from being the Emperor of China, he is considered as the sixth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. He was an able ruler of the Yuan dynasty, and his reign established the patterns of power for the next few decades.

Temür was the third son of the Crown Prince Zhenjin and a grandson of the Yuan Dynasty founder Kublai Khan. During his rule, he achieved the nominal suzerainty of all Mongol states of the time. He showed respect for Confucianism, and called off invasions of Burma, Đại Việt and Japan. However, his reign was beset by corruption and administrative inefficiencies.

== Early life ==

Named Öljeyitü Khan (&quot;Blessed Khan&quot;) in the Mongolian language, Temür (&quot;iron&quot;) was born the third son of Zhenjin of the Borjigin clan and Kökejin (Bairam-Egechi) of the Khunggirad clan on 15 October 1265. Because Kublai&#x27;s first son Dorji died early, the second-born Zhenjin became the crown prince. Zhenjin died in 1286 when Temür was 21 years old. Kublai remained close to Zhenjin&#x27;s widow Kökejin, who was high in his favor. Like his grandfather Kublai, Temür was a follower of Tibetan Buddhism.

Temür followed his grandfather Kublai to suppress the rebellion of Nayan (Naiyan) and other rival relatives in 1287. Then he and Kublai&#x27;s official, Oz-Temür, came to guard the Liao River area and Liaodong in the east from Nayan&#x27;s ally, Qadaan, and defeated him. Kublai appointed Temür the princely overseer of Karakorum and surrounding areas in July 1293. Three Chagatai princes submitted to him while he was defending Mongolia, fleeing to Chagatai Khanate and returning to the Yuan dynasty again during the reign of Temür.

After Kublai Khan died in 1294, Kublai&#x27;s old officials urged the court to summon a kurultai in Shangdu. Because Zhenjin&#x27;s second son Darmabala had already died in 1292, there were only two potential successors: Zhenjin&#x27;s other sons, Gammala and Temür. It was proposed that they hold a competition over who had better knowledge of Genghis Khan&#x27;s sayings. Temür won and was declared the emperor.

== Reign ==

Following in the policies of his grandfather Kublai, Temür was finally able to achieve nominal suzerainty of the entire Mongol realm. However, he failed to improve the corruption and administrative inefficiencies that were endemic during his rule of the empire.

Ideologically, Temür&#x27;s administration showed respect for Confucianism and Confucian scholars. Shortly after his accession, Temür issued an edict to revere Confucius. Temür appointed Harghasun, who was particularly close to the Confucian scholars, right grand chancellor in the secretariat. Nevertheless, the Mongol court did not accept every principle of Confucianism. Temür bestowed new guards and assets on his mother and renamed her ordo (great palace-tent or camp) Longfugong palace, which became a center of Khunggirad power for the next few decades. Mongol and westerner statesmen were assisted by an array of Chinese administrators and Muslim financiers. The most prominent Muslim statesman was Bayan (Баян), great-grandson of Saiyid Ajall Shams al-Din, who was in charge of the Ministry of Finance. Under Mongol administrators Oljei and Harghasun, the Yuan court adopted policies that were designed to ensure political and social stability. Orders were given that portraits be painted of the khagans and khatuns during the reign of Temür.

The number of the Tibetans in the administration gradually increased. The Khon family of Tibet was honored, and one of them became an imperial son-in law in 1296. Temür reversed his grandfather&#x27;s anti-Taoist policy and made Taoist Zhang Liusun co-chair of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies. In 1304, Temür appointed the Celestial master of Dragon and Tiger Mountain as head of the Orthodox Unity School. He banned sales and distillation of alcohol in Mongolia in 1297, and the French historian René Grousset applauded his activity in the book, &quot;The Empire of the Steppes&quot;.

Temür was opposed to imposing any additional fiscal burden on the people. Exemptions from levies and taxes were granted several times for part or all of the Yuan. After his enthronement, Temür exempted Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing) and Shangdu from taxes for a year. He also exempted the Mongol commoners from taxation for two years. In 1302 he prohibited the collection of anything beyond the established tax quotas. The financial state of the government deteriorated, however, and the draining of monetary reserves greatly weakened the credibility of the paper currency system. Corruption among officials of the Yuan became a problem.

In his 1303 decree, Temür noted that low salaries for officials hinder honesty and suggested adding &quot;salary rice&quot;. The Central Secretariat decided to increase salaries for clerks by providing one sheng of rice for each liang of salary notes. Officials earning ten to twenty-five liang would receive one dan of rice, with additional sheng given for higher amounts. In non-rice producing areas, officials received an extra twenty-five liang of Zhongtong notes for each dan of rice due.

During the last years of Temür, a peace among the Yuan dynasty and the western Mongol khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate, Ilkhanate) was achieved around 1304 after the Kaidu–Kublai war that had lasted for more than 30 years and caused the permanent division of the Mongol Empire. Temür Khan was recognized as their nominal suzerain. While the peace itself was short-lived and the war soon resumed, this established the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates that lasted for a few decades.

=== Foreign Policy: Southeast Asia ===

Soon after his enthronement in 1294, Temür called off all preparations for further expansions to Japan and the Đại Việt, whose new ruler ignored his grandfather&#x27;s envoy in 1291. Temür sent his messengers to Japan and Champa to demand submissions. Champa accepted the terms, but the Kamakura shogunate declined, and the Japanese Wokou attacked Ningbo late in his reign. The rulers of Đại Việt, Burma, and Sukhotai visited Khanbaliq to greet him as their overlord in 1295, 1297, and 1300. In response to the visit from the prince of Burma, he aborted the Burmese campaign and said to all his ministers: &quot;They are our friendly subjects. Do not attack their people&quot;. Temür also released envoys of Đại Việt to show his goodwill, and the Tran court began to send tributary missions. But Temür&#x27;s government had to quell rebellions in the southwestern mountainous area, led by tribal chieftains like Song Longji and female leader Shejie in 1296. It took long months for the generals Liu Shen and Liu Guojie to suppress these rebellions.

By the request of the Burmese prince, Tribhuvanaditya, Temür dispatched a detachment of the Yuan army to Burma in 1297. They successfully repelled the Shans from Myanmar. Temür also received envoys from Siam and Cambodia. He dispatched Zhou Daguan to Khmer Cambodia in 1296, and Zhou wrote an account about his journey. In 1299 Athinkaya murdered his brother Tribhuvanaditya, who submitted to Temür in 1297. In 1300, a punitive expedition was launched as the Second Mongol invasion of Burma for dethroning Temür&#x27;s protectorate, Tribhuvanaditya. The Shan warlords of Babai-Xifu, who were quarreling over the royal succession of Pagan, also raided the Yuan realms. Temür sent his Yunnan-based force in turn to halt the advance of Babaixifu (Lanna Kingdom of Chiangmai) in 1301–1303. Although those campaigns were fruitless, Athinkaya and the Shan lords offered their submission. The costly expedition spurred rebellions of a Yunnan official, Song Longji, and the Gold-Tooths (ancestors of the Dai people) in 1301–03. The revolts were eventually suppressed. After Temür Khan ordered to withdraw his army from Burma, Central and southern Burma soon came under the Thai rulers who paid nominal tribute to the Yuan dynasty.

== Death ==

Because his only son Deshou died a year earlier (January 1306), Temür died without a male heir, in the capital Khanbaliq on 10 February 1307. While he did not use a Chinese regnal name as Emperor during his two eras of Yuánzhēn (元貞) 1295–1297 then Dàdé (大德), 1297–1307, while Kublai had done so before him, posthumously he became Emperor Qinming Guangxiao (欽明廣孝皇帝) with temple name Emperor Chengzong of Yuan. He was succeeded by Khayishan, a son of his deceased elder brother Darmabala, who ruled as Külüg Khan and Emperor Tongtian Jisheng Qinwen Yingwu Dazhang Xiao (統天繼聖欽文英武大章孝皇帝) with later temple name Emperor Wuzong of Yuan and who made a pact before his coronation for his younger brother Ayurbarwada to be crown prince before any progeny of Khayishan, and then for their descendants to alternate rule; though this pact was broken and Khayishan&#x27;s descendants persecuted by Ayurbarwada&#x27;s mother after Ayurbarwada succeeded as Buyantu Khan with later temple name Emperor Renzong of Yuan. A bit downstream, the Khan and Emperor title would pass out of both Temür and Darmabala&#x27;s descendants to one from their brother Gammala who had been older than Temür but lost out as successor in the competition devised to choose between them.

== Early life ==
Rita Wilson (birth name is Margarita Ibrahimoff) was born on October 26, 1956 in Los Angeles. Her mother, Dorothea Tzigkou (), was Greek, raised in Sotirë near Dropull i Sipërm in Albania, close to the border with Greece. Her father, Hassan Halilov Ibrahimoff (; 1920–2009), was a Bulgarian Muslim (Pomak) born in Oraio (Breshtene), Greece, close to the border with Bulgaria. Her father&#x27;s family moved to Bulgaria when he was a child. He moved from Bulgaria to the US in 1949. He converted from Islam to Orthodox Christianity upon his marriage and changed his name to Allan Wilson in 1960, choosing his name after a local street. The family lived in Los Angeles, where Wilson&#x27;s father worked as a bartender. Wilson was raised in the Greek Orthodox faith. In addition to Bulgarian, her father could speak &quot;Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, a little bit of Italian, a little bit of French&quot; according to Wilson&#x27;s husband Tom Hanks, who said he modeled his portrayal of the character Viktor Navorski in the film &quot;The Terminal&quot; on his father-in-law.

== Career ==

=== Film, television, theater ===
Wilson&#x27;s career began with a guest appearance on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; in the 1972 episode &quot;Greg&#x27;s Triangle,&quot; where she played Pat Conway, one of the candidates running against Marcia Brady for head cheerleader. She also twice appeared on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1982 as Nurse Lacey as well as the sitcoms &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; starring her future husband Tom Hanks, and as Hester Rose Crane, the deceased mother of Frasier Crane on &quot;Frasier&quot;. 

In the 1980s, Wilson attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in England.

She has appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Volunteers&quot;, &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;, &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, &quot;Now and Then&quot;, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;, &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;, &quot;Invisible Child&quot;, &quot;The Story of Us&quot;, &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;, and &quot;Larry Crowne&quot;.

On television, she played Susan Borman, wife of astronaut Frank Borman, in the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. She guest starred in many series, including &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Body of Proof&quot;, and had recurring roles on &quot;The Good Wife&quot; and &quot;Girls&quot;.

She was instrumental in helping actress-playwright Nia Vardalos get the movie deal for &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, which became the highest-grossing independent film of all time and for which she served as a producer. Wilson produced two stage productions of the play, as they were developing the film. A sequel, &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&quot;, which Wilson co-produced and in which she had a supporting role, was released in 2016.

Wilson&#x27;s own Greek heritage was honored in 2016 when the Greek Postal Service ELTA commemorated her with a stamp along with five others. The other four depicted on stamps were the filmmaker Costa-Gavras, engineer and entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, journalist George Stephanopoulos, and billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis. In 2008, Wilson produced the film &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, and eight years later its sequel, &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot;.

In 2006, Wilson made her Broadway debut where she performed the role of Roxie Hart in the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;. In April 2015, Wilson announced that she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. After a one-month hiatus, she returned to Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot; Broadway show. Off Broadway, she played various roles in Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron&#x27;s play &quot;Love, Loss and What I Wore&quot;. She reprised her roles in the Los Angeles production at the Geffen Playhouse. Also at the Geffen, Wilson performed in Daniel Margulies&#x27; Pulitzer Prize-winning play, &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot;, directed by Tony Award winner Dan Sullivan. Wilson originated the role of &quot;Mama&quot; in the world premier of Lisa Loomer&#x27;s play, &quot;Distracted,&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum, also in Los Angeles.

In March 2020, while filming in Australia, Hanks announced through his Instagram profile that the couple had contracted COVID-19 and were experiencing minor symptoms while he was shooting an upcoming film &quot;Elvis&quot; (as Colonel Tom Parker) with director Baz Luhrmann in Australia. Before they were returned to quarantine, they were admitted to the Gold Coast University Hospital. On March 27, Wilson and her husband returned home to Los Angeles after they recovered from the virus. The couple decided to donate their blood antibodies for virus research.

Wilson produced the film &quot;A Man Called Otto&quot;, initially released in December 2022. Wilson became interested in producing the film after watching &quot;A Man Called Ove&quot;, the Swedish film upon which &quot;A Man Called Otto&quot; is based. The film was sold to Sony Pictures in February 2022 for $60 million, at that time the largest deal to date at the virtual European Film Market. In December, Wilson launched her production company Artistic Films, with &quot;A Man Called Otto&quot; as the company&#x27;s first project.

=== Music ===
Wilson&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;AM/FM&quot; was released on May 8, 2012, on Decca Records. The album featured classics from the 1960s/70s, including a cover of &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot; that she performed with the song&#x27;s writer-composer Jimmy Webb. She also performed a duet of &quot;All I Have To Do Is Dream&quot; with former Soundgarden and Audioslave musician Chris Cornell. Additional harmonies on the album come from Faith Hill, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, and Patti Scialfa (who also produced the track &quot;Come See About Me&quot; with Ron Aniello).

At the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony in Washington, DC on December 4, 2014, she performed for President Obama and Michelle Obama, and served as co-host of the event.

In 2016, Wilson began writing her own songs with the help of co-writer, the Grammy-nominated Kara Dioguardi. The first song she wrote and sang was &quot;Grateful&quot; (later appearing on the self-titled album, &quot;Rita Wilson&quot;) with Dioguardi and Jason Reeves. Earlier, in 2014, Wilson wrote the song &quot;Bad Things&quot; with Matt Nathanson, for the Scott Eastwood film &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;, in which she also starred.

That same year, her second album, &quot;Rita Wilson,&quot; was released. Wilson co-wrote all the songs on the album with Dan Wilson, Kara Dioguardi, Jason Reeves, Darrell Brown, Sugarland&#x27;s Kristian Bush, Richard Marx, Lauren Christy, Mikal Blue, Nathan Chapman, Jason Wade, Stephanie Chapman, Ron Aniello, Jillian Jacqueline, Jessi Alexander, JR Randall, Yugomir Lonich, Blair Daly, and Kelly Archer. The song &quot;Strong Tonight&quot; was performed by Connie Britton on the ABC television show, &quot;Nashville&quot;, in the opening of the episode in which it was included.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Ms. Wilson has a catch in her voice that conveys yearning and potential heartbreak behind a facade of cheer.&quot;

To support the release of &quot;Rita Wilson,&quot; she opened on a tour with Chicago; she has said she is a lifelong fan of the band.

A year later, Wilson presented &quot;Liner Notes: Songwriters, Stories and Music with Rita Wilson and Friends&quot;, where she sang, and also invited other singer/songwriters to participate in the event. The show, which took place at the Audrey Skirball Kenis Theater at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, included Patty Smyth, Desmond Child, Jeff Barry, Kristian Bush, among others.

With her third album, &quot;Bigger Picture&quot;, Wilson drew directly from her personal life for its theme. The album, released September 28, 2018, reunited her with producer Fred Mollin (Johnny Mathis, Jimmy Webb, and Kris Kristofferson); the pair originally worked together on her debut album &quot;AM/FM&quot; in 2012. Wilson once again wrote originals such as the title track and others with Kristian Bush and Darrell Brown, as well as new partners The Warren Brothers, Lindy Robbins and Alex Reid. The set also included covers of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;The Wind&quot; and Burt Bacharach/Hal David&#x27;s &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot;.

Also, in 2018, Wilson&#x27;s original song, &quot;Heart Unknown&quot;, was used in the indie film, &quot;Simple Wedding&quot;. She performed the song, which she co-wrote with Josh Alexander, Kara Dioguardi, and Mozella. In addition, she performed &quot;Sometimes Love&quot;, co-written with David Hodges, for the independent film &quot;Emmett,&quot; in which she also stars.

On March 29, 2019, Wilson released her fourth album, &quot;Halfway to Home&quot; which included &quot;Throw Me a Party&quot;, a song inspired by her survival from breast cancer. Other songs were created during a writing workshop that partnered her with Mozella, Mitch Allan (Demi Lovato), Kara DioGuardi (Pink), Liz Rose and Krisian Bush. &quot;Halfway to Home&quot; was co-produced by Nathan Chapman, who has worked regularly with Taylor Swift. &quot;&quot;Halfway to Home&quot; finds Wilson pulling from musical traditions that revere deep storytelling (Southern California rock, classic Nashville country), which was a hallmark for her growing up,&quot; explained Rolling Stone.

In the course of her music career, Wilson has performed her songs on &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Today&quot;.

In March 2020 after she and husband Tom Hanks contracted the coronavirus while filming in Australia and in self-quarantine and going &quot;stir crazy&quot;, she filmed an Instagram video showing her rapping the Naughty by Nature song, &quot;Hip Hop Hooray&quot;. The video went viral and reached Naughty by Nature&#x27;s Vin Rock. After she and husband both fully recovered from virus, the two teamed up for a &quot;Hip Hop Hooray&quot; remix that benefit the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. In July 2020, Wilson appeared on Jimmie Allen&#x27;s &quot;Bettie James&quot; EP, collaborating on the song &quot;When This Is Over&quot; with Tauren Wells and The Oak Ridge Boys. In October 2020, Wilson was featured on the single &quot;Pink&quot; alongside Dolly Parton, Monica, Jordin Sparks and Sara Evans. The single was released in aid of Breast Cancer Research.

In 2021 she contributed to the Blues Traveler rendition of &quot;Crazy&quot; on their album &quot;Traveler’s Blues&quot;. 

On August 24, 2022, Wilson announced her duets album &quot;Now &amp; Forever&quot;, a collection of 70s covers with male vocalists, through a behind the scenes trailer. Co-produced by Wilson and Matt Rollings, the album features Willie Nelson, Keith Urban, and Elvis Costello among other guests. The album, which was preceded by 3 singles including &quot;Songbird&quot; which she performed with Josh Groban at Radio City Music Hall in April, was released on September 27. To promote the album Wilson performed on Good Morning America with Smokey Robinson and Later with Jools Holland with Jackson Browne, and celebrated the release with a two week residency at Cafe Carlyle. The album was nominated for Self-Released Record of the Year at the 2023 Libera Awards. In December 2023, Barack Obama featured Wilson&#x27;s song &quot;Crazy Love&quot; with Keith Urban on his list of favorite songs of the year.

In 2022, Wilson collaborated with Sebastián Yatra on the single &quot;Til You&#x27;re Home&quot; from the soundtrack to the film &quot;A Man Called Otto&quot;.

On March 29, 2023, Wilson attended the White House&#x27;s Greek Independence Day celebration hosted by President Biden alongside other prominent Greek-Americans. Wilson led the event&#x27;s cultural program, performing four songs.

=== Journalism ===
Wilson has been a contributing editor to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine, writing over twenty-one articles. She also started, and was Editor at Large of, a section on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called Huff/Post50, which explored issues and topics relative to people over fifty years old. She has also written for &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Wilson married actor Tom Hanks in 1988. Hanks already had two children from a previous marriage, Colin and Elizabeth Hanks. She has two sons with Hanks, Chet and Truman. Wilson has three grandchildren.

She is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church.

== Activism ==
In 2015, Wilson signed an open letter on which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures. The letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively. The G7 and AU were expected to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that was to establish new development goals for the generation.

== Philanthropy ==
For over 20 years, Wilson and her husband, Tom Hanks, have been honorary co-chairs along with Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw of the Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), specializing in raising money for women&#x27;s cancers. In 2016, WCRF joined forces with Evelyn Lauder&#x27;s Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Wilson contributed to the Moffitt Cancer Center by donating &quot;True Hearts&quot; jewelry made of sterling silver and 14k gold.

Wilson has credited Rosie O&#x27;Donnell as inspiration for her charitable work, particularly with cancer and children&#x27;s charities. She and her husband have long supported the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles, going back to 1989 when Wilson appeared as Celia in a production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Their annual Simply Shakespeare event raises funds to support programs for underprivileged youth. Musicians at the fundraiser have included Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Jackson Browne, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Ben Harper, Reba McEntire, and more. 

In 2018, Wilson and Hanks were honored with USC Shoah Foundation&#x27;s Ambassadors For Humanity award in recognition of their &quot;longstanding commitment to humanitarian causes and support of veterans&quot;. The couple also contribute to other charities including AIDS Project Los Angeles, and many more.

Wilson and her husband have also made a significant contribution in helping the people who suffered from the Mati Fire in Greece. This has earned her and Hanks an offer of honorary naturalization in Greece from the Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos on December 27, 2019.

<text>Gadjah Mada University (; , abbreviated as UGM) is a public research university located in Sleman, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Officially founded on 19 December 1949, Gadjah Mada University is one of the oldest and largest institutions of higher education in the country, and has been credited as one of the best universities in Indonesia. In the 2024 QS World University Rankings, UGM is ranked 2nd in Indonesia and 263rd in the world.

During the period when native education was often restricted, the institution was the first to open its medicine to native Indonesians when it was founded in the 1940s under Dutch rule.

Comprising 18 faculties and 27 research centers, UGM offers 68 undergraduate, 23 diplomas, 104 master&#x27;s and specialist, 43 doctorates, and 4 clusters of post-doctoral study programs. The university has enrolled approximately 55,000 students, 1,187 foreign students, and has 2,500 faculty members. UGM maintains a campus of , with facilities that include a stadium and a fitness center.

The university is named after Gajah Mada, the leader of the Majapahit Empire of Java in the 14th century, who is also considered to be the nation&#x27;s first unifier by some historians. The spelling of the university&#x27;s name still reflects the old Dutch-era spelling.

==History==

UGM was the first state university in Indonesia, established as Universiteit Negeri Gadjah Mada (UNGM) when Indonesia was still facing threats from the Netherlands, which wanted to regain control. At the time, the capital of Indonesia had moved from Jakarta to Yogyakarta.

UGM was established through Government Regulation (PP) No. 23 of 1949, regarding the merger of colleges to form a university. Although the regulations were dated 16 December, UGM&#x27;s inauguration took place on 19 December, intentionally chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the Dutch invasion of Yogyakarta, exactly one year before 19 December 1948. The intentional date was meant to show that one year after the Netherlands had invaded the city, the government would establish a nationwide university there.

When it was founded, UGM had six faculties: Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy; Law, Economics, Social and Political Sciences; Engineering; Letters, Pedagogy and Philosophy; Agriculture; and Veterinary Medicine.

From 1952 until 1972, the Faculty of Law, Social and Political Sciences was split into two faculties: the Surabaya branch of the Faculty of Law, Social, and Political Sciences, which was integrated into University of Airlangga; and the Faculty of Education and Teacher Training, which was integrated into IKIP Yogyakarta (now Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta).

During its initial years of Dutch resistance, the university taught literature and law in the buildings and other facilities belonging to the palace of Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, who volunteered his palace for the university&#x27;s use. UGM gradually established a campus of its own in Bulaksumur, on the northern side of Yogyakarta, and now occupies an area of three square kilometres.

==Faculties and schools==

The UGM main building is called the &quot;Balairung,&quot; a rectorate building, in Sleman. Nearby is the &quot;Grha Sabha Pramana&quot;, a large building utilized for graduation ceremonies, with an adjoining square used for sport and recreation. There is also a university library and a sports center, consisting of a stadium, tennis court, and basketball field.

Most of the main campus is located in Sleman, with the small parts (such as part of the Vocational School and part of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences) located within Yogyakarta city.

The UGM administration is divided into 18 faculties, offering study programs from the undergraduate to post-doctoral level. There is also a vocational school offering vocational study programmes.

===International Programmes===
UGM provides some major programs in English and admits international students. In 2018, 1,334 Asian students, 566 European students, 213 Australian/Oceanian students, 101 North American students, 58 African students, and 12 South American students studied in the 18 faculties of Gadjah Mada University.

====Computer Science International Undergraduate Programme====
CSIUP began in the 2012 academic year. It offers undergraduate computer science classes in English. It teaches algorithm and software design, intelligent systems, programmable logic and embedded systems, and mobile computing. The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has been teaching Computer Science courses since 1987 (BSc), 2000 (MSc), and 2003 (PhD), organized jointly by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Physics, which has also offered courses in Electronics and Instrumentation since 1987 (BSc). In 2010, the Department of Computer Science and Electronics (DCSE) was formed by merging Computer Science resources within the Department of Mathematics with the Electronics and Instrumentation group within the Department of Physics. Students of DCSE have won gold medals in robotics competitions both nationally and internationally (in Korea in 2012 with a humanoid robot, and in the US in 2013 with a legged robot).

====Medicine International Undergraduate Programme====
In 2002, UGM began offering an English-language-based medicine programme for overseas and Indonesian students to study medicine with an international standard curriculum. The International Medicine Programme is over five years, with the first three and a half years being study and a further one and a half years of clinical rotations. The programme is designed around a problem-based learning approach, making use of small study groups.

====Business school====
In 1988, UGM opened a master&#x27;s programme in management (MM-UGM), to train students in business practices. The program is a collaboration with the University of Kentucky and Temple University. The Faculty of Economics and Business UGM is ranked among 5% of the world&#x27;s best business schools after it received an international Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation. In 2010, UGM opened a similar campus in South Jakarta, Jakarta.

====Medical school====
The Faculty of Medicine UGM is one of the oldest medical schools in Indonesia, having been established on 5 March 1946. It is ranked number 72 by the Times Higher Education Supplement 2006 for biomedicine.

====Engineering school====
Before being part of the UGM, the faculty of engineering was already providing engineering education under the name of STT Jogjakarta since 1946. After the UGM establishment meeting on 20 May 1949, STT Jogjakarta changed its name to the Faculty of Engineering of UGM and admitted 205 students. The faculty consists of 3 departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering.
Between 1957 and 1966, the engineering faculty received support from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). UCLA gave books, equipment, and scholarships to lecturers as well as sent their professors to teach in the faculty of engineering of Gadjah Mada University.

Currently, the faculty of engineering has 8 departments: Architecture &amp; urban planning, civil &amp; environmental engineering, geodetic engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical &amp; industrial engineering, electrical and informatics engineering, nuclear and physic engineering, and geological engineering. Each department has been accredited by ABET (USA), IChemE (UK), ASIIN (Germany), KAAB (South Korea), AUN QA (ASEAN), IABEE (Indonesia), and BAN-PT (Indonesia).

===Research Centers===

==Student life==

===Student orientation===

Every year, UGM welcomes new undergraduate students by holding a one-week student orientation session called PPSMB (&quot;Pelatihan Pembelajar Sukses bagi Mahasiswa Baru Palapa&quot;, &quot;Training for New Students to be Successful Learners&quot;) which involves a short course introducing UGM&#x27;s common knowledge, values, rules, and soft-skill education. It was named &quot;PPSMB Palapa&quot; (named after Palapa oath) since its inception in 2012, before renamed to &quot;PPSMB Pionir&quot; () in 2023. On the last day of the program, there is a closing ceremony where students make a formation of a symbol or logo. In 2018, the students created a formation called &quot;Bersatu Nusantara Indonesia&quot; (&quot;United Indonesian Archipelago&quot;) with the Indonesian national flag, to encourage a spirit of unity across differences in the country. In 2023, PPSMB broke a record for featuring ten different formations with just 30 minutes of preparation.

===Community service===
UGM organizes a community service called KKN-PPM (short for &quot;Kuliah Kerja Nyata-Pembelajaran Pemberdayaan Masyarakat&quot; or &quot;Student Community Service-Community Empowerment Learning&quot;, in English), which is obligatory for undergraduate students. KKN-PPM is a research-based community service offered three times each academic year, in the middle of both the odd semester and the even semester, and between these two semesters. Not only local students joining the KKN, but also international academicians, including lecturers and students, are involved in KKN-PPM UGM. In 2011, 150 international students participated in KKN-PPM, coming from many countries, such as South Korea, Australia, France, the US, and Norway.

==Controversies==
===Yogyakarta Principles===

The Yogyakarta Principles—a set of principles outlined in Geneva, Switzerland, which were intended to apply international human rights law guidelines in support of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people—were developed at Gadjah Mada University.

Islamic and religious groups, and civil prosecutors, attacked the LGBT community as being suspect in &quot;promoting communism or westernization&quot;, although the Yogyakarta Principles merely address ending violence, abuse, and discrimination of LGBT people.

===2016 student demonstration===
In 2016, more than 1000 of UGM&#x27;s students and staff flocked to the university&#x27;s headquarters for a demonstration that was said to be the biggest after the 1998 national demonstration. The demonstration went peacefully, with no damage reported by the university, although it got a bit heated when the university&#x27;s rector, Mrs. Dwikorita Karnawati, claimed that the demonstration was a simulation officially held by UGM. Three factors led to this demonstration: tuition (&quot;uang kuliah tunggal&quot;) that was deemed too expensive; the university&#x27;s status as a &quot;state university with corporation status&quot; (PTNBH), which led to the tuition fee rate ruling by the university; and to stop the relocation of so-called &quot;bonbin&quot; canteen located between Faculty of Cultural Sciences and Faculty of Psychology.
===2017 sexual assault case===
On 5 November 2018, UGM&#x27;s student publication body BPPM Balairung through its online portal &quot;Balairungpress.com&quot; published an article containing the account, from a female student (&quot;Agni&quot;), of an alleged rape she experienced at the hands of a male fellow student (&quot;HS&quot;) while doing a so-called &quot;student work experience&quot; (&quot;Kuliah Kerja Nyata&quot; – KKN) program in Seram Island, Maluku in June 2017. However, on 4 February 2019, UGM announced the case was resolved and claimed it concluded with a rather &quot;peaceful&quot; resolution.

When learning of the rape allegation, UGM–KKN officials chose not to forward Agni&#x27;s accusation to the police. Instead, they were skeptical of Agni&#x27;s account. Regardless, HS was pulled from the KKN program about a week later because he was deemed to be &quot;incompatible&quot; with other KKN participants.

After Agni returned to Yogyakarta in September 2017, she received a C-grade for the program, apparently in retaliation for the shame her allegation had brought upon an official. Agni then filed a formal complaint about her alleged rape to higher-ranking officials at the university, who raised her grade to A/B but still did not report HS to law enforcement. Instead, the university agreed to pay for the counseling Agni had been seeking to deal with her trauma, as well as requiring HS to go to counseling as well. HS was allowed to take part in another KKN program the semester after the alleged rape, and he is expected to graduate soon.

UGM spokesperson Iva Ariani confirmed the account as told in &quot;Balairungpress.com&quot; and says that the university is now taking further steps to investigate the rape allegation. She admitted to &quot;Kompas&quot; that the case was happened, that UGM has &quot;extraordinary empathy&quot; for the victim and also &quot;concerned&quot; about the incident.
===2024 tuition fee protest===
On 2 May 2024, coinciding with National Education Day, students held a demonstration at UGM&#x27;s rectorate building that criticized the high tuition fees that didn&#x27;t match the students&#x27; financial capabilities. In a statement given by the Coordinator of the UGM Advocacy Forum, Rio Putra Dewanto, it&#x27;s revealed that a survey conducted on 722 students from the class of 2023, it was found that 511 or 70.7 percent of students felt that the tuition fees set by UGM are too heavy, and 52.1 percent of students urged that it should be reconsidered.

Vice Rector for Human Resources and Finance, Supriyadi, guarantees that all students can complete their education without having to be constrained by costs. He added that the campus had made a decision letter to assign students as verifiers of tuition determination data in each faculty. In this verification, a team containing students is tasked with re-verifying all data so that tuition determination is more accurate.

<doc id="1088746" wikidata="Q5477720" url="?curid=1088746" title="Vikramaditya II">
<text>Vikramaditya II (reigned 733 – 744 CE) was the son of King Vijayaditya and ascended the Badami Chalukya throne following the death of his father. This information comes from the Lakshmeshwar inscriptions in Kannada dated 13 January 735 A.D. From inscriptions it has come to be known that even before his coronation, Vikramaditya II, as a crown prince (&quot;Yuvaraja&quot;), had conducted successful military campaigns against their arch enemy, the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. His most important achievements were the capture of Kanchipuram on three occasions, the first time as a crown prince, the second time as an emperor and the third time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. This is attested to by another Kannada inscription, known as the Virupaksha Temple inscription which alludes to the emperor as the conqueror of Kanchi on three occasions and reads &quot;Sri Vikramaditya-bhatarar-mume-Kanchiyan-mume parajisidor&quot;. The other notable achievement was the consecration of the famous Virupaksha Temple (&quot;Lokeshwara&quot; temple) and Mallikarjuna Temple (&quot;Trilokeshwara&quot; temple) by his queens Lokadevi and Trilokadevi at Pattadakal. These two monuments are the centre piece of the UNESCO World Heritage Monuments at Pattadakal. Vikramaditya II was a powerful ruler and was in power for 40 years. In order to maintain peace he entered into marriage alliance with Rashtrakutas.

== Wars against Pallavas ==

Unlike King Vijayaditya, who had ruled till a very old age in a long and peaceful reign of four decades, Vikramaditya II&#x27;s inscriptions seem to convey an impatience for war. From those inscriptions, historians feel that he nursed a grudge against the Pallavas, who a century ago, under the leadership of Narasimhavarman I, had defeated the Chalukyas and occupied their regal capital Badami, thus bringing to an end the glorious reign of Pulakeshi II and causing humiliation to the Chalukya royal family. From these inscriptions, it is known that nothing short of complete annihilation of the Pallavas (&quot;prakrity-amitra&quot;) could redeem the lost dignity of the Chalukyas. Vikarmaditya II, armed with this vengeful enthusiasm (&quot;mahotsaha&quot;), invaded the Pallava country.

Immediately after coming to power, Vikramaditya II saw an opportunity in the ensuing civil war in Kanchipuram and espoused the cause of Chitramaya, against that of Nandivarma II. Vikramaditya II fought many battles with the Pallavas, won three important victories, and occupied Kanchipuram on those occasions. Around 730, as the Chalukya crown prince, assisted by the Western Ganga Dynasty prince Ereyappa, he attacked the Pallava Paramesvaravarman II. The Pallava king had to sue for peace at a great financial loss to his kingdom. The Pallava subsequently tried to mount a counter-attack at the Ganga ally King Sripurusha (731), but was killed in the battle of Vilande. Sripurusha seized the kings insignia, the royal umbrella and earned the title &quot;Permanadi&quot;. Though this victory to the Chalukyas happened during the rule of King Vijayaditya, the records of Chalukya monarchs give full credit to Vikramaditya II.

Vikramaditya again invaded the Pallava kingdom after 734, aided by the faithful ally, the Western Ganga King Sripurusha, who joined the Chalukyas in this expedition. The earliest mention of this invasion is in the Narwan plates issued on 21 December 741 or 742. The Pallava King Nandivarman was a 13-year-old boy who nevertheless made a valiant but futile attempt to face the invasion. The Pallava king fled Kanchipuram into exile, leaving behind all his regal attributes which included among other things, a prestigious musical drum (&quot;katumukha&quot;), a musical instrument (&quot;samudraghosa&quot;) and a mace. Many of his war elephants, a large quantity of precious stones and gold fell into the hands of the victorious Chalukya monarch.

The road to Kanchipuram lay open and Vikramaditya II entered the city victorious. He ensured that the residents of the city were not harmed nor were the beautiful monuments destroyed (from inscription - &quot;Kanchim avinasya pravisya&quot;). The bounties of war were also returned. Unlike many conquering kings, Vikramaditya behaved in a very honorable way and showed consideration towards both the inhabitants and the city. Many donations were made to local Brahmins and gifts given to the weak and the forlorn citizens. Vikramaditya II had in his moment of revenge transformed himself from an overbearing conqueror to a humble devotee of the deities in the temples of Kanchipuram. The act of returning large amounts of bounty to the temples earned him religious merit. All that was then inscribed on a Kannada language inscription on the back of a pillar in the &quot;mantapa&quot; (hall) of the Kailasanatha temple. His benevolent acts at other temples have also been recorded in his copper plate inscriptions. Vikramaditya thus wiped out the disgrace that had fallen on the Chalukya empire by the occupation of Vatapi a century earlier by the Pallava Narasimhavarman I. Having satiated his quest for revenge, Vikramaditya II returned to Badami. The Chalukyan empire then reached its proportions during the rule of Pulakeshi II.

He overran the kingdoms of Chera, Chola and Pandyas and defeated a Kalabhra ruler as well. Those victories were written in his inscription on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The final invasion of Kanchipuram happened in the final years of the reign of Vikramaditya II, under the leadership of his son Kirtivarma II.

== Conflict with Arabs ==
In the early years of Vikramaditya&#x27;s reign, Arab invaders who had established themselves in the Sindh made a push into the Deccan during the Umayyad campaigns in India. Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin, a son of Vikramaditya I&#x27;s brother Jayasimhavarman who was the governor of the Lata branch (Gujarat) fought and defeated an Umayyad army in 739 CE. Vikramaditya II so appreciated his valour, he conferred the title of &quot;Avanijanasraya&quot; (refuge of the people of the earth) on Pulakeshin. The Rashtrakuta King Dandivarma or Dantidurga also fought along the Chalukyas against the Arabs.

==Rule==
Vikramaditya II donated 50 &quot;nivartanas&quot; of land for maintenance of charity house of &quot;Dhavala-Jinalaya&quot; at Lakshmeshwara, Dharwad district in 735 CE.

<text>USS &quot;Mingo&quot; (SS-261) — a submarine — was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the mingo snapper.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Mingo&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 30 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Henry L. Pence, and commissioned on 12 February 1943.

==Operational history==
After shakedown off Long Island, &quot;Mingo&quot; departed for Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island, on 1 April 1943 for three weeks of operations with the Naval Torpedo Station. She cleared Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut on 16 May 1943 for the Pacific via the Panama Canal Zone.

===First and second war patrols===
After further training at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, &quot;Mingo&quot; departed on her maiden war patrol on 25 June 1943. She made damaging attacks on three Japanese merchant ships and bombarded Sorol Island off the Palaus before returning to Pearl Harbor for refit.

Her second war patrol — from 29 September-20 November — took her to the Marshalls, Carolines, and Marianas. Her torpedoes damaged a Japanese cruiser. She departed the Hawaiian Islands for overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, San Pablo Bay, California. It is likely that her Hooven-Owens-Rentschler diesels were replaced with Fairbanks-Morse Model 38D opposed piston engines during this overhaul. The submarine left the West Coast on 3 February 1944 for continued operations in the Pacific.

===Third and fourth war patrols===
For her third war patrol, &quot;Mingo&quot; joined the US 7th Fleet in patrolling the South China Sea. She then sailed for Brisbane, Australia, via the Bismarck Sea and Milne Bay, New Guinea, arriving on 9 May. She continued on to Manus, Admiralty Islands on 10 June for further training.

&quot;Mingo&quot; left Manus for the Philippines on 18 June on her fourth war patrol. On 7 July, she attacked a Japanese high-speed convoy off Luzon and sank the destroyer . The submarine put into Fremantle, Australia on 30 July.

===Fifth and sixth war patrols===
&quot;Mingo&quot; began her fifth war patrol on 27 August 1944. Although her primary operation was lifeguard duty in support of the US Thirteenth Air Force strikes on the Philippines and Borneo, she sank four coastal freighters. &quot;Mingo&quot; did a noteworthy job as lifeguard as she rescued 16 B-24 Liberator fliers shot down off Balikpapan, Borneo; six of them from rubber boats in Makassar Strait and the other 10 from the beach of Celebes Island. On 4 October, a U.S. Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator patrol bomber mistakenly attacked her, dropping a bomb which landed from &quot;Mingo&quot;, inflicting no damage or casualties. She moored in Fremantle on 13 October.

Her sixth war patrol, mostly reconnaissance duty, took place west of Borneo. On 25 November, &quot;Mingo&quot; made a night torpedo attack on a Japanese convoy on a run between Singapore and Brunei, Borneo. Beside damaging an escort gunboat, she sank loaded 9,486-ton tanker &quot;Manila Maru&quot;. The sinking of a maru of that name was prophetic, for the Japanese were only three months away from losing their hold completely on the ship&#x27;s namesake, the Philippine capital. After assisting two other submarines in successful attacks, she returned to Fremantle on 29 December for repairs.

===Seventh war patrol===
&quot;Mingo&quot; took station at the South China Sea again for her seventh and last war patrol from 6 February–10 April 1945. On 14 February, she sailed to Fremantle to repair damage caused by a hurricane in which she had lost two men on 10 February. She departed on 19 February for further patrol off the Gulf of Siam before arriving in the Marianas on 10 April.

&quot;En route&quot; to Hawaii on 14 August, &quot;Mingo&quot; received word of the end of hostilities. After a short stay at Pearl Harbor, she sailed for the West Coast.

===Japanese service, 1955–1966===

On 1 January 1947 &quot;Mingo&quot; decommissioned at Mare Island and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Recommissioned on 20 May 1955. &quot;Mingo&quot; was transferred on loan to Japan under the Military Assistance Program and renamed &quot;Kuroshio&quot; (SS-501) on 15 August. Her initial role was as an underwater training target for surface vessels. She continued to serve the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as &quot;Kuroshio&quot; until decommissioned on 31 March 1966. She was sunk as a target in 1973.

==Awards==
&quot;Mingo&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service. Five of her seven war patrols were designated &quot;successful&quot;.

<doc id="1088753" wikidata="Q203937" url="?curid=1088753" title="Gaudeamus igitur">
<text>&quot;De Brevitate Vitae&quot; (Latin for &quot;On the Shortness of Life&quot;), more commonly known as &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; (&quot;So Let Us Rejoice&quot;) or just &quot;Gaudeamus&quot;, is a popular academic commercium song in many European countries, mainly sung or performed at university graduation ceremonies. Despite its use as a formal graduation hymn, it is a jocular, light-hearted composition that pokes fun at university life. The song is thought to originate in a Latin manuscript from 1287. It is in the tradition of &quot;carpe diem&quot; (&quot;seize the day&quot;) with its exhortations to enjoy life. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many early universities and is the official song of many schools, colleges, universities, institutions, student societies and is the official anthem of the International University Sports Federation.

==Content==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the bacchanalian mayhem of student life while simultaneously retaining the grim knowledge that one day we will all die. The song contains humorous and ironic references to sex and death, and many versions have appeared following efforts to bowdlerise this song for performance in public ceremonies. In private, students will typically sing ribald words.

The song is sometimes known by its opening words, &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; or simply &quot;Gaudeamus&quot;. In the UK, it is sometimes affectionately known as &quot;The Gaudie&quot;. The centuries of use have given rise to numerous slightly different versions.

===Lyrics===
The proposition that the lyrics originate in 1287 is based on a manuscript held in the &quot;Bibliothèque nationale de France&quot; in Paris. A poem starting with the words &quot;Subscribere proposui&quot; (&quot;I have suggested signing (it)&quot;) has two verses that closely resemble the later &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; verses, although neither the first verse nor the actual words &quot;Gaudeamus igitur&quot; appear. The music accompanying this poem bears no relation to the melody which is now associated with it. A German translation of these verses was made in about 1717 and published in 1730 without music. A Latin version in a handwritten student songbook, dating from some time between 1723 and 1750, is preserved in the Berlin State Library (formerly located at Marburg); however, this differs considerably from the modern text. The current Latin lyrics with a German translation were published by Halle in 1781 in &quot;Studentenlieder&quot; (&quot;Students&#x27; Songs&quot;) written by Christian Wilhelm Kindleben (1748-1785), who admitted to making important changes to the text.

Below is Kindleben&#x27;s 1781 Latin version, with two translations to English (one anonymous, and another by Tr. J. Mark Sugars, 1997). The New-Latin word &quot;Antiburschius&quot; refers to opponents of the 19th-century politically active German student fraternities.

When sung, the first two lines and the last line of each stanza are repeated; for instance:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Gaudeamus igitur,&quot;
&quot;Iuvenes dum sumus,&quot;
&quot;Gaudeamus igitur,&quot;
&quot;Iuvenes dum sumus!&quot;
&quot;Post iucundam iuventutem,&quot;
&quot;Post molestam senectutem,&quot;
&quot;Nos habebit humus,&quot;
&quot;Nos habebit humus.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Music===
The first appearance in print of the present melody was in &quot;Lieder für Freunde der Geselligen Freude&quot; (&quot;Songs for Friends of Convivial Joy&quot;), published in Leipzig in 1782, together with Kindleben&#x27;s German lyrics; however, the tune was evidently well known before this date. The first publication of the present Latin text together with the present melody was probably in Ignaz Walter&#x27;s 1797 operatic setting of &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;. It is also heard in Berlioz&#x27; Damnation of Faust.

Johannes Brahms quoted the melody in the final section of his &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot;, in a fortissimo rendition performed by the full orchestra.

Sigmund Romberg used it in the operetta &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, which is set at the University of Heidelberg.

It is quoted in Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Studenten-Polka&quot; (Française, Op.263), first performed at the students&#x27; ball at the Redoutensaal on 24 February 1862.

The tune is quoted, along with other student songs, in the overture of Franz von Suppé&#x27;s 1863 operetta &quot;Flotte Burschen&quot;, the action being once again set at the University of Heidelberg.

Based on the original melody, Franz Liszt composed the Gaudeamus igitur—Paraphrase and later (1870) the Gaudeamus igitur—Humoreske. Pyotr Tchaikovsky made an arrangement for male chorus with piano accompaniment (1874) (TH 187 ; ČW 413).

Tom Lehrer mentioned the Gaudeamus in his satirical song, &quot;Bright College Days&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Turn on the spigot&quot;
&quot;Pour the beer and swig it&quot;
&quot;And gaudeamus igit-itur&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;In 1979, New England Science Fiction Association member Joe Ross wrote a parody of the song, with lyrics referencing the 1955 film &quot;This Island Earth&quot;. The parody was titled &quot;Haec Insula Terra&quot; (a Latin translation of the film&#x27;s title) and was published in the first volume of the &quot;NESFA Hymnal&quot;. Warwick Academy in Bermuda uses part of the lyrics as their school song.

<text>Jewellery Quarter station is a combined railway station and tram stop, situated in the Jewellery Quarter of Birmingham, England. The station is served by West Midlands Trains (who operate the station), Chiltern Railways, and West Midlands Metro.

The station is set at the mouth of Hockley No 2 Tunnel below the elevation of its road-level access point on Vyse Street; stairs and a lift are provided.

==History==
Jewellery Quarter station was opened in 1995, as part of the &quot;Jewellery Line&quot; project which saw the re-introduction of cross-city services via Birmingham Snow Hill. Midland Metro services commenced in 1999, when its first (and so far only) line from Birmingham to Wolverhampton opened.

No previous station had existed at this site, however the area was historically served by Hockley station, located a short distance west, which had been opened by the Great Western Railway in 1854, and was closed with the line in 1972.

==Facilities==
The station has no car park, but ten cycle storage spaces are available. The station has a ticket office, but this has limited opening hours; a self-service ticket machine is provided for use when the ticket hall is closed and for collecting pre-paid tickets. Train running information is offered via automated announcements, CIS displays, timetable posters and customer help points on each side.

Outside the station entrance on Vyse Street is a sculpture called &quot;Clockwork&quot; by Mark Renn, which dates from 2004. There is also a Victorian cast iron public urinal, dating from around 1880, which is now disused but is grade II listed.

<text>Queens Moat Houses PLC was a British public limited company engaged primarily in the hotel business.

==History==
Queens Moat House Hotels was founded in the early 1970s by John Bairstow. By 1991, the company was the third largest hotelier in the United Kingdom, after Forte Group and Mount
Charlotte. On 31 March 1993, trading in its shares was suspended after an accounting scandal. The company was subsequently investigated under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985. In 1997, the company sold 25 hotels. The company was bought by Goldman Sachs in August 2005 and renamed QMH Limited. In October 2005, 9 hotels were sold for approximately £100m. In February 2013, 20 German hotels were sold to Fattal Hotels, an Israeli company. In 2014, 11 hotels were sold to Marathon Asset Management.

<text>Saves the Day is an American rock band formed in 1997 in Princeton, New Jersey. The band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Chris Conley, guitarist Arun Bali, bassist Rodrigo Palma, and drummer Claudio Rivera.

After forming under the name Sefler in 1994, Saves the Day released their debut studio album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;, through Equal Vision Records in 1998. It was followed by &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; (1999), which featured their first single, &quot;Shoulder to the Wheel&quot;. The band achieved mainstream success with the release of &quot;Stay What You Are&quot; (2001), released through Vagrant Records, which sold 200,000 copies and spawned the MTV2 hit singles &quot;At Your Funeral&quot; and &quot;Freakish&quot;. The album&#x27;s success allowed the band to sign to the major label DreamWorks Records, who released the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;In Reverie&quot; (2003). DreamWorks folded into Interscope Records, who dropped the band weeks after the album&#x27;s release. The band have since released five more albums under the Vagrant, Razor &amp; Tie and Equal Vision labels, with their most recent, &quot;9&quot;, being released on October 26, 2018.

== History ==

=== Formation and first releases (1994–2000) ===
Sefler was a four-piece band, formed in 1994, which performed in the New Jersey area, and featured Chris Conley on bass guitar and vocals. Sefler changed its name to Saves the Day in late 1997. Of Saves the Day&#x27;s original lineup, only Conley remains today; the band has gone through numerous personnel changes over the years, and has only recorded two consecutive albums with the same lineup (&quot;Through Being Cool&quot; and &quot;Stay What You Are&quot;, respectively), with Conley as the only permanent member.

Saves the Day&#x27;s first proper release, &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;, was recorded and released through Equal Vision Records in 1998, while the members were still in high school.

Using their own resources, Saves the Day released a five-song acoustic EP, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;m Leaving&quot;, in early 1999. Later that year, they released their second full-length with Equal Vision, &quot;Through Being Cool&quot;, which saw them further refining their melodic sound. They began drawing attention from some of the larger independent labels, eventually signing with Vagrant Records.

=== &quot;Stay What You Are&quot; and commercial exposure (2001–2003) ===
In 2001, Saves the Day began moving away from their roots with the release of &quot;Stay What You Are&quot;. The album had a poppier feel, with more intricate guitar work and arrangements rather than the previous power chord-based sound. They gained some exposure with a video for the song &quot;At Your Funeral&quot;, and made appearances on &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;. They also released a video for &quot;Freakish&quot; in April 2002; the video featured Muppet-esque puppets. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, guitarist Ted Alexander left and Conley took over guitar duties. The album was also original drummer Bryan Newman&#x27;s last recording with the band, who also left shortly after the album&#x27;s release. The album artwork featured photographs taken by the photo duo Day 19.

&quot;At Your Funeral&quot; reached No. 76 on the UK Singles Chart in June 2002.

=== Major label signing for &quot;In Reverie&quot; (2003–2005) ===
With the success of &quot;Stay What You Are&quot;, Saves the Day signed with major label DreamWorks Records, who would co-release their next album with Vagrant, who still had them under contract. The 2003 release of &quot;In Reverie&quot; saw them further experiment with their sound and featured less macabre lyrics than past recordings. The drastic change in sound was alienating among fans, and the album received little support from DreamWorks. The song &quot;Anywhere With You&quot; was released as a single, but went largely unnoticed, despite the album peaking at 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart. Conley later said the following about the album&#x27;s release in an interview with &quot;Skratch Magazine&quot;:
&quot;DreamWorks Records completely abandoned it three days after it was released, saying that we made the wrong record. Then they were sold a month later. They were worthless.&quot;
Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, DreamWorks Records was absorbed by Interscope, who would eventually drop them from its roster.

Saves the Day finally fulfilled their contractual obligations with Vagrant Records in 2004 with the release of &quot;Ups and Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides&quot;, which was a collection of b-sides and included the &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;m Leaving&quot; EP. &quot;Ups and Downs&quot; also featured a song from their early days as Sefler. Conley said in an AP Podcast interview that the wrong Sefler song had been put on the CD. He had asked for a different song, but when he received the final version he discovered it was the wrong one. The album was dedicated to former bassist Sean McGrath, who died in 2004 at age 28, after a two-year battle with intestinal cancer. McGrath recorded with them on &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; and had left during the writing of &quot;Through Being Cool&quot;. Saves the Day was relatively inactive in 2004, though during that time they set up their own studio, The Electric Ladybug, located in Chico, California.

=== Three-part concept: &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot;, &quot;Under the Boards&quot; and &quot;Daybreak&quot; (2005–2011) ===

In early 2005, Saves the Day began writing their follow-up to &quot;In Reverie&quot;. During the writing process, longtime bassist Eben D&#x27;Amico left and was replaced by Glassjaw bassist Manuel Carrero.

Saves the Day recorded their fifth studio album, &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot;, in 2005, without a label. They announced in January 2006 that they had re-signed with Vagrant, who would release &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot; in April. The album marked a return to their macabre lyrics and drew more from their influences than &quot;In Reverie&quot; had. During the &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot; recording sessions, they also recorded an EP of acoustic versions of several songs from past albums, which was sold on tour throughout 2006 as &quot;Bug Sessions Volume One&quot;. Saves the Day toured extensively throughout 2006 and early 2007 in support of the album. It was announced that &quot;Sound the Alarm&quot; was part one of a three-part concept. The next album in the trilogy, &quot;Under the Boards&quot;, was released in 2007. The third album in the series, &quot;Daybreak&quot;, was finally released in September 2011, after a very long wait by fans.

In February 2007, they announced that thirteen demos had already been recorded for a new album, which would be titled &quot;Under the Boards&quot;. It was also revealed that this would be the second of a three-part concept involving &quot;&quot;Sound the Alarm&quot;, &quot;Under the Boards&quot; and the yet to be released &quot;Daybreak&quot;. Chris Conley said that &quot;&quot;Sound the Alarm&quot; is an expression of discontent. &quot;Under the Boards&quot; is reflection and remorse. &quot;Daybreak&quot; is acceptance.&quot;

Conley also said about the three-album concept:
&quot;The whole trilogy was just a bit of a therapeutic experiment. I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn&#x27;t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like &#x27;this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself&#x27;. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there. The second album, &quot;Under the Boards&quot;, dealt with how all of that was making my life unbearable, and I realized I had to change, so that album was the transitional part, starting to transition out of that dark place, because you realize how it&#x27;s affecting your life. So &quot;Daybreak&quot; is coming to terms with everything and trying to understand why I actually got that way and learning to accept it by exploring what it is and why it was there and simultaneously trying to grow through it and be a better person, not purely full of anger.&quot;

In March 2007, after more than four years with the band, drummer Pete Parada left to join the Offspring. Carrero&#x27;s Glassjaw bandmate Durijah Lang took over drumming duties, and recorded on &quot;Under the Boards&quot;. The album was released on October 30, 2007, through Vagrant Records.

Chris Conley said in an interview that the next &quot;Bug Sessions&quot; would be a collection of live songs recorded on their 30-date acoustic tour. Volumes 2 and 3 of the once-tour-exclusive EPs were originally only sold on tour, but are now on the iTunes Music Store. After a string of shows on the East Coast in late October 2008, &quot;Saves the Day&quot; planned to enter the studio to begin work on their next studio album, &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

Saves the Day began working on &quot;Daybreak&quot; in 2009. It was announced in March 2009 that longstanding guitarist David Soloway would no longer be playing for Saves the Day. He continues to play bass for his side project Two Tongues with Chris Conley. In April, Arun Bali was announced as Soloway&#x27;s replacement. Continuing this string of events, on December 21, it was announced that bassist Manuel Carrero and drummer Durijah Lang would be leaving to focus on Glassjaw. They were replaced by Rodrigo Palma on bass and Spencer Peterson (ex-Hidden In Plain View) on drums.

In September 2010, Peterson&#x27;s personal website announced that he had left Saves the Day and joined Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Pete Wentz&#x27;s new electropop group Black Cards. About two weeks later, drummer Claudio Rivera&#x27;s personal website announced that he had joined Saves the Day. In October 2010, the band announced that they would be selling dropcards to access a digital-only EP, &quot;1984&quot;, while on tour with Say Anything and Motion City Soundtrack. The EP contains the track &quot;1984&quot; from the upcoming album.

&quot;Daybreak&quot; was released on September 13, 2011, through Razor &amp; Tie, after several delays during the previous two years. This was the first time Saves the Day had released an album without a single band member (besides Conley) having played on an earlier record.

=== &quot;Saves the Day&quot; (2011–2015) ===

In a December 2011 interview, Chris Conley revealed that an eighth Saves the Day album was in the works and that he was hoping that the band would be back in the studio in the fall of 2012 to record it. On November 23, 2012, Saves the Day announced they were making a new record, but wanted the fans to get involved. They signed up on PledgeMusic and offered fans everything from free downloads and album updates to limited edition T-shirts, tickets to shows, and private house shows. They released a demo to &quot;pledgers&quot; of one of the songs on the new album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Kind of Love&quot;, when pledging started. For Christmas 2012, they did a cover of &quot;Baby Please Come Home&quot;, and in the new year, Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Across the Sea&quot;. Saves the Day released a music video for their song &quot;Ring Pop&quot; on YouTube. The album, titled &quot;Saves the Day&quot;, was released on September 17, 2013.
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Dennis Wilson had joined Saves the Day on a permanent basis, replacing former drummer Claudio Rivera.
After the album was released, the band did two tours: a headlining North American tour, with Into It. Over It. and Hostage Calm supporting, and a North American holiday acoustic tour, with Walter Schreifels and Jon Simmons.

In 2014, Saves the Day supported Brand New on their UK tour.

On September 4, 2014, Saves the Day and Say Anything announced a co-headlining tour, with support from Reggie and the Full Effect. The three bands were celebrating anniversaries. Saves The Day celebrated 15 years since &quot;Through Being Cool&quot;; Say Anything had their 10th anniversary of &quot;...Is a Real Boy&quot;, and Reggie celebrated &quot;Under The Tray&quot;.

=== &quot;9&quot; (2016–present) ===
On February 26, 2016, Chris Conley tweeted about the &quot;first song on the next saves the day record&quot; being his &quot;new favorite song of all time.&quot;

On August 14, 2018, Saves the Day released a new song called &quot;Rendezvous,&quot; and announced that they would be releasing their ninth album, containing nine tracks, and called &quot;9&quot;, on October 26, 2018, via Equal Vision Records.

In 2020, drummer Dennis Wilson left Saves the Day and Claudio Rivera rejoined the band. (Wilson would later join Balance and Composure in 2023.)

==== Sexual misconduct allegations ====
In May 2021, Conley was accused of sexual misconduct and grooming by a fan of his. Among the allegations included claims that Conley sent unsolicited nude photographs and manipulated his fandom to lure him into a relationship. Conley admitted to &quot;making an unacceptable number of inappropriate missteps causing irreversible harm&quot; and said &quot;I am truly ashamed and embarrassed by my abhorrent behavior.&quot; Equal Vision Records, which released &quot;Saves the Day&quot; and &quot;9&quot;, stated &quot;We are working diligently to uncover the truth behind what happened and our actions moving forward will reflect what we are able to find.&quot;

== Side projects ==
In 2009, Chris Conley and former Saves the Day guitarist David Soloway got together with Max Bemis and Coby Linder of Say Anything to form the supergroup Two Tongues. The group features Bemis and Conley sharing lead vocals and guitar duties, with Soloway on bass guitar and Linder on drums. Thirteen songs were recorded in Electric Ladybug Studio, Conley&#x27;s home studio in Chico, California. Bemis, Conley, and Linder previously collaborated on a cover song of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Man In Me&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Paupers, Peasants, Princes &amp; Kings: The Songs of Bob Dylan&quot;, released by Doghouse Records in 2006. The group&#x27;s self-titled debut was released on February 3, 2009.

In Fall 2010, Two Tongues made their first public (surprise) performance in the middle of Say Anything&#x27;s set each night of the Motion City Soundtrack/Say Anything/Saves the Day tour, performing the song &quot;Crawl&quot;. Arun Bali (current guitarist of Saves the Day) played guitar, Kenny Vasoli (of the Starting Line and Person L) played bass, Jake Turner (of Say Anything) played guitar, and Coby Linder played drums, while Chris Conley and Max Bemis sang.

<text>Shadowgate is a point-and-click adventure game developed by ICOM Simulations and published in 1987 for the Macintosh as part of the MacVenture series. The game takes place in the Castle Shadowgate, residence of the evil Warlock Lord. The player, as the &quot;last of a great line of hero-kings&quot;, is tasked with saving the world by defeating the Warlock Lord, who is attempting to summon the demon Behemoth out of Hell. The original Macintosh version was only in black-and-white, but color versions of the game were later released for the Amiga and Atari ST, and in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was generally well-received, and was followed by several sequels and remakes for various systems.

==Gameplay==


&quot;Shadowgate&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game in which the player must solve a series of puzzles throughout a castle to proceed to the Warlock Lord&#x27;s chamber. Due to the castle&#x27;s perilous nature, at least one lit torch must be in the player&#x27;s possession at all times. If all torches are extinguished, the player soon stumbles, breaking their neck, and must then continue from a saved game (or the area where they died, in console versions). Only a limited number of torches can be found throughout the game, which effectively acts as a time limit. The player may acquire various items such as a sword, a sling and other ancient weapons which can be used at the appropriate time to deliver a fatal blow to specific enemies. 

The game has many instances of death, including being burned by dragon&#x27;s breath, attacked by a cyclops, sucked into outer space through a broken mirror, dissolved by acidic slime, eaten by sharks, mauled by a wolf-woman, and suicide. Virtually any action taken by the player which is not the correct solution to a puzzle will result in a fatality. These deaths are often graphically described in the game&#x27;s text (along with frequent sardonic and humorous comments), even in the NES version (in spite of Nintendo&#x27;s policy of censorship at the time). Many of the game&#x27;s puzzles rely on a system of trial and error, requiring the player to frequently save their game to avoid losing progress. Subtle hints can be found in books and the descriptive game texts. In the NES version, these are replaced by a hint feature which gives vague clues about what is noteworthy in any given room. 

==Plot==
&quot;Shadowgate&quot; begins as the protagonist finds themselves standing at the entry to the Castle Shadowgate, remembering that they had been tasked by the wizard Lakmir with defeating the evil Warlock Lord before he can raise the Behemoth from the depths and destroy the world.

The protagonist then enters Castle Shadowgate and begins to solve its puzzles, while surviving its many traps and defeating various monsters along the way. During the journey, he collects three sacred artifacts which together form the Staff of Ages, a holy weapon capable of stopping the Warlock Lord once and for all. 

The protagonist eventually enters the Warlock Lord&#x27;s chamber just as he succeeds in opening the gates of Hell and summoning the Behemoth. The protagonist assembles the Staff and uses it to mortally wound the Behemoth. As it dies, the Behemoth then drags the Warlock Lord with him into Hell. The protagonist returns victorious, where he is betrothed to the King&#x27;s daughter and entitled High Lord of the Westland.

==Ports==
&quot;Shadowgate&quot; was originally released for Macintosh in 1987 and ported to other computers, including a color version for the Atari ST and Amiga later the same year. In 1988, it was released for MS-DOS and in 1989 for the Apple IIGS. It made its first console appearance later that year for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The success of &quot;Shadowgate&quot; on the NES prompted ICOM Simulations to have Kemco port the other MacVenture titles to the console, including &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;. The NES version of &quot;Shadowgate&quot; is one of the few NES games with a Swedish language version. In 1992, an enhanced version of the game was released for Windows 3.1x. 

The NES port was rereleased in October 2017 (alongside &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;) for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in a collection called &quot;8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume 1&quot;, developed by Abstraction Games.

In 2024, a port for the Playdate handheld console was announced.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game a very positive review, noting the game uses the same superior interface as prior MacVenture games. The difficulty was noted as a step up from &quot;Deja Vu&quot; and &quot;Uninvited&quot;, but &quot;Shadowgate&quot; was also said to be more flexible, allowing more than one solution to some puzzles.

The game was reviewed in 1987 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #128 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers stated &quot;&quot;Shadowgate&quot; is a great adventure game in that you must continually be aware of what’s already been accomplished to complete subsequent puzzles&quot;. The reviewers gave the game 5/5 stars.

Keith McCandless of &quot;Macworld&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of &quot;Shadowgate&quot;, praising its extensive gameplay, stating &quot;so much is jammed into these two disks that nearly everyone should find this game appealing ... &quot;ShadowGate&quot; plays easily and instinctively&quot;. McCandless also praised &quot;Shadowgate&#x27;s&quot; graphics and sound, calling the graphics &quot;expertly crafted&quot;, despite &quot;[lacking] originality&quot;, and called the sound effects &quot;far better than those of most adventure games&quot;. He further called &quot;Shadowgate&quot; &quot;technically, visually, and aurally superior to most of its competition&quot;, but criticized the game&#x27;s mood, stating that it doesn&#x27;t &quot;take itself seriously enough to create a mood of mystery&quot;, and also lacks the &#x27;tongue-in-cheek&#x27; humor of other adventure games, creating a feeling of something &quot;lacking&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1996, Infinite Ventures acquired from Viacom the rights to &quot;Shadowgate&quot; and other games originally developed by ICOM Simulations. ICOM Simulations had been acquired by Viacom in 1994, but had published no updates to the original products. After the acquisition, Infinite Ventures ported the game to other operating systems such as Windows 9x, as well as portable systems including Windows CE and Palm OS, under the name of &quot;Shadowgate Classic&quot;. These versions had a new interface and menu layout, with artwork based on the 1996 Windows versions.

In 1999, Infinite Ventures licensed the NES version of &quot;Shadowgate&quot; to Kemco and it was ported to the Game Boy Color with enhanced sprites and animations, also under the name of &quot;Shadowgate Classic&quot;.

In 2005, a mobile phone version of the game was released by Vindigo Entertainment. Once again using the name of &quot;Shadowgate Classic&quot;, this version featured brand new graphics, puzzles, challenges, and areas.

In 2006, Infinite Ventures licensed the rights to the ICOM Simulations portfolio to Zojoi, LLC, a company formed by &quot;Shadowgate&quot;″s original game designers, Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs. In October 2012, Zojoi launched a Kickstarter campaign to secure funding for a remake of &quot;Shadowgate&quot;. Original game creators Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs appeared in the pitch video and showed pre-production footage of the game in development. They set a crowd-funding goal of $120,000. In the 2nd update of the Kickstarter campaign, the Black Axe, an item and quest that had been cut from the original game due to size constraints, was announced to be reintroduced in the new version of &quot;Shadowgate&quot;. Those who pledged $2,500 or more received a replica Staff of Ages. The campaign finished successfully, earning $137,232 in pledges by November 2012 and reaching its first stretch goal. The remake was completed and released for Windows in 2014. In 2019, it was ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.

===Sequels===

In 1991, a novel written under the pen name &quot;F.X. Nine&quot; called &quot;Before Shadowgate&quot; was published by Scholastic Corporation as part of the &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; series of video game novelizations of third party Nintendo Entertainment System games. The novel acts as a prequel to the game, and featured contributions from &quot;Shadowgate&quot; co-creators Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs, who provided important details and information to the book&#x27;s author.

There have been two sequels to the game. The first, &quot;Beyond Shadowgate&quot;, was released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1993 and the second, &quot;Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers&quot;, for the Nintendo 64 in 1999. Another N64 sequel, &quot;Shadowgate Rising&quot;, was well into development, but the project was scrapped when Nintendo announced a new console which became the GameCube.

On September 16, 2021, 317 Games launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for &quot;Shadowgate, The Living Castle&quot;, a board game based on the &quot;Shadowgate&quot; series.

In October 2021, Zojoi and Azure Drop Studios released &quot;Shadowgate VR: The Mines of Mythrok&quot;, an exclusive Oculus Quest title.

On January 22, 2023, Zojoi announced a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for &quot;Beyond Shadowgate&quot;, the official sequel to the NES version of &quot;Shadowgate&quot;. A video from series co-creator Dave Marsh notes this project uses the original design documents from 1990 and is unrelated to the TurboGrafx-16 game. It was released on Steam and GOG on September 19, 2024.

<text>Avilés (; ) is a town in Asturias, Spain. Avilés is, along with Oviedo and Gijón, one of the main cities in the Principality of Asturias.

The town occupies the flattest land in the municipality, partially in a land that belonged to the sea, surrounded by small promontories, all of them having an altitude of less than 140 metres. Situated in the Avilés estuary, in the Northern Central area of the Asturian coast, west of Peñas Cape, is its national seaport.

Avilés is mainly an industrial city. It is close to popular beaches like Salinas. It also has important churches like St. Thomas of Canterbury.
Avilés has also cultural spaces such as the Palacio Valdés Theatre (in Spanish: ) or the Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre (in Spanish: ).

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===

The existence of the town proper is documented only in the latter Early Middle Ages, although the etymology of the name &quot;Avilés&quot; is likely ancient. It is thought to come from a local Roman landowner or likely a Romanized Germanic warrior who settled there from/to the Kingdom of the Suebi or Visigothic Kingdom, as much toponymy in northern Spain shares a Germanic origin named &quot;Abilius&quot;.

=== Chronology ===

Archaeological excavations have shown that the area was already settled in the upper palaeolithic era.

The first well known document is an endowment of two churches by Asturias King Alfonso III, in 905. During the Middle Ages, it was one of the most important ports of the Biscay Bay, trading mainly with French ports, the main trade was salt. At this time, it had two nuclei: a fishermen&#x27;s district, Sabugo, and the aristocratic centre, La Villa, standing each other across a small water inlet at the site of present-day Avilés&#x27; main Park. La Villa was surrounded by strong walls, which demonstrated its strategic and commercial importance. On 15 January 1479 the Catholic Monarchs granted a free market on each Monday of the year, which still takes place. The importance of the town as a naval centre is supported by the building of ships with wood harvested from nearby forests, and with the participation of local sailors in the conquest of Seville by the Castilian army, which is reflected in Avilés&#x27;s coat of arms.

It is the birthplace of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, a soldier in the army of Felipe II, who explored Florida in the 16th century and founded in 1565 the first successful (continuously populated) European town in what is now the United States, San Agustín (now St. Augustine, Florida). St. Augustine and Avilés are now sister cities. Avilés is also the birthplace of Juan Carreño de Miranda, court painter to the king Charles II.

The estuary, which had been closed to navigation since the early modern era, was partially drained and cleared in the 19th century. The water inlet dividing the place was covered, so that the two nuclei, Sabugo and La Villa, could be joined together. Then the city began to grow outside the medieval wall, which had been demolished in 1818. In the 20th century, there was an enormous growth in population due to the arrival of several large factories to the town. In 1953 were started the first earthworks for the construction of the factory of ENSIDESA, a large steel mill, currently Aceralia (part of ArcelorMittal); other companies in the area are Cristalería Española, which together with ENDASA, currently Alcoa, transformed Avilés into one of Spain&#x27;s industrial centres. Nowadays, the city is trying to focus on new industries, particularly cultural tourism, and recover its antique flavour.

<doc id="1088786" wikidata="Q1684725" url="?curid=1088786" title="Ranfurly, New Zealand">
<text>Ranfurly is a town in the Central Otago District of Otago, New Zealand. Located north of Dunedin, it lies in the dry rough plain of Maniototo at a moderately high altitude (around above sea level) close to a small tributary of the Taieri River. It operates as a service town for the local farming community. The town was formerly known as Eweburn, one of the &quot;farmyard&quot; names bestowed by former Otago Chief Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson on many small streams and locations in the district. The modern name honours the Fifth Earl of Ranfurly, who served as Governor of New Zealand (1897–1904) at the time of the extension of the Otago Central Railway to the area. Ranfurly is well known for its Art Deco buildings, such as its hotel and the dairy.

==History==
During the Otago gold rush of the 1860s, several important deposits of the precious metal were found near Ranfurly, notably at Kyeburn and Naseby, close to the southwestern face of the Kakanui Range.

After the gold-rush faded Ranfurly grew at the expense of Naseby, spurred by the arrival of the railway in 1898. The rail line was closed in 1989 and the track removed, but its course became a major walking and cycling route, the Otago Central Rail Trail, which attracts tourists. The former railway station now serves as a museum and display centre.

The town became an important service-centre for the rural community, experiencing a building boom in the 1930s. It has a large proportion of rural Art Deco buildings which have been preserved from that time. An annual festival commemorating Ranfurly&#x27;s Art Deco heritage used to take place each February. 

The nearby Ida Valley functioned as one of the locations for Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001–2003 &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, representing the wide plains of Rohan.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification Ranfurly has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with continental influence.

Central Otago in general, and the Maniototo in particular, has one of New Zealand&#x27;s very few zones influenced by continental climates, with large daily and seasonal temperature extremes. Average highs in summer are around , with occasional days as warm as ; average winter highs are around , with the coldest nights below . The lowest temperature on record in New Zealand () was recorded at Ranfurly in 1903. Heavy frosts are common throughout winter.

The town is sheltered from the prevailing rain patterns by the mountains to the west. The Nor&#x27;wester foehn wind is thus a frequent weather pattern, and annual rainfall is only in the region of .

<doc id="1088787" wikidata="Q5988368" url="?curid=1088787" title="Identity component">
<text>In mathematics, specifically group theory, the identity component of a group &quot;G&quot; (also known as its unity component) refers to several closely related notions of the largest connected subgroup of &quot;G&quot; containing the identity element. 

In point set topology, the identity component of a [[topological group]] &quot;G&quot; is the connected component &quot;G&quot;0 of &quot;G&quot; that contains the identity element of the group. The identity path component of a topological group &quot;G&quot; is the path component of &quot;G&quot; that contains the identity element of the group. 

In algebraic geometry, the identity component of an [[algebraic group]] &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is the identity component of the underlying topological space. The identity component of a [[group scheme]] &quot;G&quot; over a base scheme &quot;S&quot; is, roughly speaking, the group scheme &quot;G&quot;0 whose fiber over the point &quot;s&quot; of &quot;S&quot; is the connected component &quot;G&quot;&quot;s&quot;0 of the fiber &quot;Gs&quot;, an algebraic group.

== Properties ==
The identity component &quot;G&quot;0 of a topological or algebraic group &quot;G&quot; is a closed normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. It is closed since components are always closed. It is a subgroup since multiplication and inversion in a topological or algebraic group are continuous maps by definition. Moreover, for any continuous automorphism &quot;a&quot; of &quot;G&quot; we have 

:&quot;a&quot;(&quot;G&quot;0) = &quot;G&quot;0.

Thus, &quot;G&quot;0 is a characteristic (topological or algebraic) subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, so it is normal.

By the same argument as above, the identity path component of a topological group is also a normal subgroup (characteristic as a topological subgroup). It may in general be smaller than the identity component (since path connectedness is a stronger condition than connectedness), but these agree if &quot;G&quot; is locally path-connected.

The identity component &quot;G&quot;0 of a topological group &quot;G&quot; need not be open in &quot;G&quot;. In fact, we may have &quot;G&quot;0 = {&quot;e&quot;}, in which case &quot;G&quot; is totally disconnected. However, the identity component of a locally path-connected space (for instance a Lie group) is always open, since it contains a path-connected neighbourhood of {&quot;e&quot;}; and therefore is a clopen set.

== Component group ==
The quotient group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;0 is called the group of components or component group of &quot;G&quot;. Its elements are just the connected components of &quot;G&quot;. The component group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;0 is a discrete group if and only if &quot;G&quot;0 is open. If &quot;G&quot; is an algebraic group of finite type, such as an affine algebraic group, then &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;0 is actually a finite group.

One may similarly define the path component group as the group of path components (quotient of &quot;G&quot; by the identity path component), and in general the component group is a quotient of the path component group, but if &quot;G&quot; is locally path connected these groups agree. The path component group can also be characterized as the zeroth homotopy group, formula_1

==Examples==
*The group of non-zero real numbers with multiplication (R*,•) has two components and the group of components is ({1,−1},•).
*Consider the group of units &quot;U&quot; in the ring of split-complex numbers. In the ordinary topology of the plane {&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + j &quot;y&quot; : &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ R}, &quot;U&quot; is divided into four components by the lines &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = − &quot;x&quot; where &quot;z&quot; has no inverse. Then &quot;U&quot;0 = { &quot;z&quot; : |&quot;y&quot;| &lt; &quot;x&quot; } . In this case the group of components of &quot;U&quot; is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
*The identity component of the additive group (Zp,+) of p-adic integers is the singleton set {0}, since Zp is totally disconnected.
*The Weyl group of a reductive algebraic group &quot;G&quot; is the components group of the normalizer group of a maximal torus of &quot;G&quot;.
*Consider the group scheme μ&quot;2&quot; = Spec(Z[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2 - 1)) of second roots of unity defined over the base scheme Spec(Z). Topologically, μ&quot;n&quot; consists of two copies of the curve Spec(Z) glued together at the point (that is, prime ideal) 2. Therefore, μ&quot;n&quot; is connected as a topological space, hence as a scheme. However, μ&quot;2&quot; does not equal its identity component because the fiber over every point of Spec(Z) except 2 consists of two discrete points.

An algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a topological field &quot;K&quot; admits two natural topologies, the Zariski topology and the topology inherited from &quot;K&quot;. The identity component of &quot;G&quot; often changes depending on the topology. For instance, the general linear group GL&quot;n&quot;(R) is connected as an algebraic group but has two path components as a Lie group, the matrices of positive determinant and the matrices of negative determinant. Any connected algebraic group over a non-Archimedean local field &quot;K&quot; is totally disconnected in the &quot;K&quot;-topology and thus has trivial identity component in that topology.

<doc id="1088788" wikidata="Q16962094" url="?curid=1088788" title="Orley Farm (novel)">
<text>Orley Farm is a novel written in the realist mode by Anthony Trollope (1815–82), and illustrated by the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais. It was first published in monthly shilling parts by the London publisher Chapman and Hall. Although the novel appeared to have undersold (possibly because the shilling part was being overshadowed by magazines such as &quot;The Cornhill&quot; that offered a variety of stories and poems in each issue), &quot;Orley Farm&quot; was later named by Trollope as his personal favourite among his novels. George Orwell said the book contained &quot;one of the most brilliant descriptions of a lawsuit in English fiction.&quot;

The Orley Farm property depicted in the book was based on a farm in Harrow, London once owned by the Trollope family. The real-life farm became a school that was originally designated as a feeder school to Harrow. It was renamed Orley Farm School after the novel, with Trollope&#x27;s permission.

==Background==
&quot;Orley Farm&quot; was written between July 1860 and June 1861. The novel was first published in monthly shilling parts by the London publisher Chapman and Hall from March 1861 to October 1862, with forty wood-engraving illustrations by John Everett Millais. Each part comprised two illustrations that were situated at the front, and two to three chapters that followed. The first volume, also published by Chapman and Hall, appeared in December 1861, before the novel&#x27;s serialisation was completed. The second volume was published in September 1862, and both volumes included the illustrations.

To produce some of these volumes, Chapman and Hall used the unsold parts, making the double volume set valuable for present-day collectors. While the cost for the monthly parts had been low, the double volume set was eleven shillings per volume. The standard price for such books was ten shillings, and in a letter to the publisher, Trollope blamed the increased price for slow sales of the first volume.

Trollope&#x27;s arrangement with Chapman and Hall was that he would receive £125 for each of the monthly parts, a sum of £2,500, with an additional half interest in each copy sold after the first 10,000. He was paid a total of £3,135 under this agreement.

==Plot summary==
When Sir Joseph Mason of Groby Park, Yorkshire, died, he bequeathed his large estate to his eldest son (also named Joseph) by his first marriage. However, in a last-minute codicil to the will, Sir Joseph left his Orley Farm property near London to his young second wife Mary (known as Lady Mason) and their infant son Lucius. Because Sir Joseph suffered from gout and was unable to write, the codicil was written by Lady Mason. There were three witnesses to the execution of the document, one of whom, Sir Joseph&#x27;s lawyer Jonathan Usbech, died soon afterwards. The eldest son, Joseph Mason, bitterly contested the codicil and his loss of Orley Farm. He brought a lawsuit against the widowed Lady Mason, charging that she obtained the changes to the will in an improper manner. But the two surviving witnesses could not be shaken from their testimony that they had duly witnessed and signed the document on the specified date. The lawsuit was decided in Lady Mason&#x27;s favor.

Twenty years pass. She is living at Orley Farm with her now-adult son Lucius. Samuel Dockwrath is a tenant of Orley Farm, a not-very-successful lawyer, and a man of questionable character. He is asked to give up his acreage because Lucius wants to try new intensive farming methods. Aggrieved, and knowing the details of the original lawsuit—because (a) his wife Miriam is the daughter of Jonathan Usbech; and (b) John Kenneby, one of the two surviving codicil witnesses, was an unsuccessful suitor of Miriam&#x27;s—Dockwrath rummages through his deceased father-in-law&#x27;s papers. He discovers a deed, which had no connection to the Masons or Orley Farm, signed by the same witnesses on the same date as the codicil. He finds it suspicious that they would have witnessed and signed two unrelated legal documents on the same day. If they remember signing only one, then he has a strong case against Lady Mason that she forged the codicil.

Dockwrath travels to Groby Park to persuade Joseph Mason to initiate another lawsuit against his stepmother. Mason agrees since he still harbors a venomous hatred towards her, who he insists has cheated him out of Orley Farm for twenty years. Dockwrath also locates and interviews the two codicil witnesses—they recall signing only one document. Joseph Mason consults his law firm, and they decide to pursue a legal strategy, which they deem more likely to succeed, of prosecuting Lady Mason for perjury (not forgery), i.e., that she perjured herself during the first trial when she testified to the circumstances of the codicil.

A sizable portion of the novel consists of the build-up to the second trial. When Lady Mason hears that a new lawsuit is pending, she becomes distraught and leans for support on her neighbors Sir Peregrine Orme, a widower in his seventies, his widowed daughter-in-law Mrs. Orme and her son. They all believe, along with Lucius, that Lady Mason is innocent and is being unjustly harassed and persecuted by her resentful stepson.

There are numerous subplots. Mr. Furnival, an experienced and well-regarded barrister, heads up Lady Mason&#x27;s legal team. Because she is characterized as a very attractive forty-year-old, her consultations with Furnival arouse the jealousy of his wife and cause a marital separation. One of the other subplots chronicles a slowly unfolding romance between Felix Graham (a relatively poor lawyer without family) and Madeline Staveley, daughter of Judge Staveley of Noningsby. Graham has a long-standing engagement to the penniless Mary Snow, whom he supports and educates while she is being &quot;moulded&quot; to be his wife. Furnival&#x27;s daughter Sophia has a flirtation with Madeline&#x27;s brother Augustus Staveley, and a brief engagement to Lucius Mason. Eventually, Furnival and his wife are reconciled, and Sophia&#x27;s engagement to Lucius is dropped. Sophia is portrayed as a shrewd young woman who writes comically adroit letters as she is always looking out for her own best interest.

Meanwhile, Sir Peregrine falls in love with Lady Mason and proposes to her. Feeling indebted to him and to Mrs. Orme for their kindness, she accepts. In the ensuing days, friends and relatives urge them to call it off, that it will be unseemly prior to the trial, and it will make Sir Peregrine appear like a foolish old man. Lady Mason is finally persuaded by Lucius that the marriage is a bad idea. She meets with Sir Peregrine to ask that they break off the engagement. He refuses, seeing no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t go forward. In a shocking admission in the middle of the novel, she confesses to him that she forged the codicil, and she will probably lose the upcoming lawsuit. She says that by marrying a criminal, he will besmirch his good name. He is stunned by her confession, agrees to terminate the engagement, and is temporarily estranged from her. But Mrs. Orme, who also learns the truth, is first to forgive Lady Mason, empathizing that it was a desperate measure undertaken to provide financial security for her son. Sir Peregrine gradually comes around as well. But they convince Lady Mason that if she is acquitted, she should return the Orley Farm property to Joseph Mason as an appropriate act of justice.

The long-awaited trial arrives near the end of the novel. On the last day of the proceedings, Lady Mason tells her son Lucius that she forged the codicil, which fills him with shame. Due to the skill of her attorneys in raising a reasonable doubt when cross-examining the two codicil witnesses, she is found not guilty of perjury. The very next day, she and Lucius notify Joseph Mason that they are turning over Orley Farm to him, which is an implicit admission of her guilt. To escape ignominy, she and Lucius leave England and settle in Germany.

==Major themes==
Against a vast panorama of carefully depicted human types and their relationships, the major themes of &quot;Orley Farm&quot; are guilt (the different manifestations of its acknowledgment by Lady Mason and by her son), revenge (its nature and reasons as indulged in by Joseph Mason and Samuel Dockwrath), suffering (by the guilty party herself and by others who love her), and love/hate (their respective presence or absence in individual characters among the Ormes, the Staveleys, the Furnivals, Felix Graham, and Mary Snow).

Another major theme is the question of individual judgment versus group judgment. Augustus Staveley purports to advise Felix Graham that a person must allow oneself &quot;to be governed by the united wisdom of others&quot; rather than to take it upon oneself to &quot;judge as to every step by his own lights.&quot; Trollope calls this advice into question. Similarly, a comic minor character, Mr. Moulder, defends Lady Mason&#x27;s acquittal thus: &quot;If a jury of her countrymen doesn&#x27;t make a woman innocent, what does?&quot;

A darker theme, also seen in Trollope&#x27;s other books such as &quot;Castle Richmond&quot; and &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot;, is that the changing Victorian world often brought anguish and disillusionment to those who had started out with great advantages. A related theme, which recurs frequently throughout Trollope&#x27;s works, is the threatened loss of one&#x27;s house or property.

==Reception==
George Eliot praised &quot;Orley Farm&quot; but found the &quot;comic relief&quot; scenes somewhat out-of-place, and wondered why &quot;The Spectator&quot; enthused over those passages. She wrote in a January 1862 letter to Sara Sophia Hennell: &quot;I have read most of the numbers of &quot;Orley Farm&quot;, and admire it very much, with the exception of such parts as I have read about Moulder and Co., which by the way, I saw in glancing at a late &quot;Spectator&quot;, the sapient critic there selects for peculiar commendation.&quot;

Trollope offered his own comments about &quot;Orley Farm&quot; and his regard for it. In Volume I of his autobiography, he wrote: &quot;The plot of &quot;Orley Farm&quot; is probably the best I have ever made; but it has the fault of declaring itself, and thus coming to an end too early in the book. When Lady Mason tells her ancient lover [Sir Peregrine Orme] that she did forge the will, the plot of &quot;Orley Farm&quot; has unravelled itself;—and this she does in the middle of the tale.&quot;

<text>Slank is an Indonesian rock band. It was founded in 1983 by teenagers in an alley street in Jakarta called Gang Potlot. The band is known for songs which are often accompanied by political and socially conscious lyrics. It continues to be active and has received many awards from the Indonesian music industry. Along with God Bless and Dewa 19, they are dubbed one of the greatest rock bands in the history of Indonesian popular music. The name Slank was inspired by friends who often called them &quot;slengean guys&quot; (in Betawi, it means men who are free in terms of characteristics and actions). Slank is an abbreviation of the word &quot;slenge&#x27;an&quot; and changes the letter G to K to improve the aesthetic. All personnel have compromised to agree on this naming. In making music, Slank voices his concern for music and the interests of all levels of society in Indonesia.

==History==
===Early years===
Bimo Setiawan Almachzumi (Bimbim) created Cikini Stones Complex (CSC) in the early 1980s. The band covered Rolling Stones songs. In 1983 the band broke up.

Accompanied by his colleagues Denny and Erwan, Bimbim created the band Red Devil. For the guitarist, Bimbim brought in Bongky Marcel. In December 1983 they changed their band name to Slank because they looked &quot;selengean&quot; (&quot;rebellious&quot; or &quot;unruly&quot;).

The initial formation of the group based in Potlot consisted of Bimbim (drums), Denny BDN (bass), Erwan (vocals), Kiki (guitar) and Bongky (guitar). The first appearance under the name Slank was held at the National University (Indonesia), Jakarta.

===Mainstream success===
Their first album, &quot;Suit-Suit...He-He&quot;, was not released until 1990. This album, which featured the songs &quot;Memang&quot; and &quot;Maafkan&quot;, was an enormous hit and won the band the BASF Award for best newcomer category. The album also seemed to slap the Indonesian music industry which at that time was still incessant Malay songs like Search&#x27;s Issabella song. Solid rock and roll blues and a la Slank music finally got close to young people in Indonesia, and their success inspired the formation of other bands, such as Dewa. Their distinctive style, ignorant, slengean, but friendly managed to attract the masses who were then still limited to a minority. 

In 1991, their second album, Kampungan, achieved the same level of success as their first album. The singles from this album, &quot;Mawar Merah&quot; and &quot;Terlalu Manis&quot;, were made in two versions: Fun and Sales. Unusually, it was precisely the song version of fun, which became hits and was often played. Here Kaka plays harmonica. In this village album, Slank included the song Nina Bobo.

In December 1993, Slank releases third album, Piss!, which is a play on the word peace. This jargon became a trend at that time. The hits single of this album are &quot;Piss&quot; and &quot;Kirim Aku Bunga&quot;. Their first three albums, awarded by BASF Indonesia for Best Selling Albums on BASF tapes in each years of released.

1994, Slank released their fourth album Generasi Biru with the several popular hits like &quot;Generasi Biroe&quot;, &quot;Terbunuh Sepi&quot;, and &quot;Kamu Harus Pulang&quot; entering Indonesia&#x27;s top charts. This was Slank&#x27;s first album to reach multi-platinum status, and the band was once again awarded by BASF Indonesia for Best Selling Albums.

Their fifth album, Minority, was released in January 1996. It featured the single &quot;Bang Bang Tut&quot; on the market. On the album, Bimbim sang a song of his title entitled &quot;Bidadari Penyelamat&quot;. There is no arrangement whatsoever, only Bimbim&#x27;s voice.

===Conflicts, various changes, and struggle===
Slank was plagued by a number of defections, some involving personal issues, others having to do with internal tensions based around creative decisions. Since its inception, Slank&#x27;s band members have changed frequently. Reasons have ranged from drug use and woman to money and differences in musical styles. The best line up of the band was Kaka (vocals), Bimbim (drums), Pay (guitar), Bongky (bass) and Indra (keyboards).While working on the sixth album, Lagi Sedih, Bimbim decided to fire Bongky, Pay and Indra. But there is also a mention that Bongky, Indra and Pay quit or resigned because of the behavior of Bimbim and Kaka who have been too severe in drug use. The split can actually be seen on their fourth album in the song &quot;Pisah Saja Dulu&quot;. Bimbim even intends to disperse Slank. But a letter written in blood by a Slanker made him discouraged. Its contents are scary. &quot;Don&#x27;t be cheeky, Bim! If Slank breaks up, it means it&#x27;s wrong! I wrote this letter using blood. Don&#x27;t let me write the next letter using your blood!&quot; Letters of threat and vows to kill Bimbim if it dissolves Slank is unavoidable. Kaka and Bimbim finally continued to work on their sixth album with the help of additional musicians. Reynold entered to fill the position of guitar and Ivanka who was often hanging out at Potlot also helped in working on the Slank project for the sixth album with the formation of this transition period. The album, Lagi Sedih, was released in February 1997. Single &quot;Koepoe Liarkoe&quot; and &quot;Tonk Kosong&quot; prove that Slank can still survive. Bid gig also arrived.

===New formation and continue success===
The entry of Abdee and Ridho, Slank continued his musical journey. The result was the album Seven which was released in January 1997 with reliable song &quot;Balikin&quot;. The album sold one million copies in a matter of weeks. From there, more albums, most of them commercially successful, followed. The negativity was overcome, and over the next 20 years, Slank was able to increase their profile, tour the world and maintain commercial success. In 2007, Slank released their 20th album, &quot;Slow But Sure&quot;.

Slank became the first MTV Indonesia icon in 2005.

In 2007, Slank released the new album, &quot;Slow But Sure&quot;; the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Slalu Begitu&quot; was played heavily on Indonesian radio stations.

In 2008 Slank toured the U.S. and Europe. They have also played in various Asian countries, such as Thailand, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea.

Having more than fifteen albums sold and occasionally causing political controversy in Indonesia, Slank decided to travel to the US to record their first English-language album, &quot;Anthem for the Broken-Hearted&quot;. Blues Saraceno was chosen to be the producer of the album. They recorded and mixed the album in only twenty-two days.

“&quot;If you want the world to see what you want to say, you better go to the highest mountain. And for music, the highest mountain now is in the U.S.A.&quot;”, says Abdee Negara.

===Java Jazz Festival 2009===
In 2009, surprisingly, Slank was invited to take part in the well known Java Jazz Festival.

Their invitation to a jazz festival by Peter F. Gontha was meant as a challenge to see if they had what it took to perform in a jazz music setting. Their show, attended by thousands, successfully transformed their songs into jazz. In the spirit of reaching a greater jazz audience by combining genres, this show featured Michael Paulo, Ron King and Tony Monaco. It later was described as a &quot;once in a lifetime experience&quot;.

==Slankers==
For more than two decades, Slank has managed a healthy attitude towards their music career, which in turn has helped them throughout the years. Slank has also gained somewhat of a cult status in Indonesia, Slank fans are known as &#x27;Slankers&#x27;, and they have a reputation for devotion. They wave their Slank flags, which consist of the word &#x27;Slank&#x27; shaped into a graffiti-style butterfly. They sing along with several punk rock songs and perform a stadium-worthy call-and-response routine. According to one of the guitarists Ridho, &#x27;Slankers&#x27; span all ages from children to adults.

==Biopic==
In 2009 Slank took part in a film called &quot;Generasi Biru&quot; that depicts their life and journey. It was directed by Garin Nugroho. For the film, Slank released a single, &quot;Slank Dance&quot;, the video clip of which depicts members of the band performing a unique dance created by their fans, the Slankers.

The storyline features members of one of two factions, both capable of time travel, engaged in a long-term conflict called &quot;The Change War&quot;. Their method of battle involves changing the outcomes of events throughout history (temporal war). The two opposing groups are nicknamed the &quot;Spiders&quot; and the &quot;Snakes&quot; after their respective sponsors. The true forms or identities of the Spiders and the Snakes, how those nicknames were chosen, or whether they are in any way descriptive are all unknown.

The narrator of the novel is Greta, a young human female employed at a Recuperation Station where soldiers recover from battles. Greta is an Entertainer: part prostitute, part nurse, part psychotherapist. However, other characters narrate parts of the story in lengthy monologues about their experiences and opinions as they visit the spider-staffed facility.

New soldiers, entertainers, and medical staff are recruited by existing Change War participants from various places and times; characters include: Cretan Amazons, Roman legionnaires, eight-tentacled Lunans (natives of a civilization that thrived on Earth&#x27;s Moon a billion years ago), Hussars, Wehrmacht Landsers, Venusian satyrs (recruited from Venus a billion years in the future), American GIs, and Space Commandos. Soldiers from the armies of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, and Stalin may find themselves fighting side by side or on opposing sides. Likewise, medical staff and entertainers are inducted into the temporal war to provide medical treatment, rest, and relaxation for injured and weary combatants.

Within the context of the story, the Universe as we know it runs on the Little Time. The Change War combatants and their facilities (places such as Field Hospitals, Express Rooms, Recuperation Stations, and Entertainment Spots), located within artificially-created bubbles of spacetime outside of the Universe, run on the Big Time. The Big Time is described metaphorically by the narrator as a train traveling through the Little Time&#x27;s countryside. Combat operations occur when soldiers venture into a time and place in the Little Time on orders from their superiors.

Adding to the atmosphere of cynicism about the war&#x27;s aims and causes is the revelation that one of its effects was to change history and cause an Axis victory in World War II. However devastating this development is to 20th century humanity, now doomed to live under the worldwide oppressive and genocidal rule of Nazi Germany, in the context of the overall Spider-Snake cosmic conflict, this change was incidental and of only marginal importance.

The first few chapters establish the backstory, setting, amazing futuristic technology and characters. The main plot of the novel involves the discovery of a time bomb in the Recuperation Station, and the attempts to defuse the bomb and identify the saboteur, essentially a locked room mystery within a science fiction context.

==Reception==
Algis Budrys praised &quot;The Big Time&quot; (which he categorized as a play, not a novel) as evidence that Leiber was the only science fiction writer of his generation &quot;who as a matter of course and conviction saw through the mores and circumstances which are now proving nonviable not only in commercial literature but in what we can call life as well&quot;, and a precursor to Roger Zelazny and Samuel R. Delany. In February 1968 he named the book the &quot;Best Thing All Year&quot;. In 2012, it was selected for inclusion in the Library of America&#x27;s two-volume compilation &quot;American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s&quot;.

==Legacy==
Leiber followed up &quot;The Big Time&quot; with seven short stories set in the same universe:

* &quot;Try and Change the Past&quot; (Astounding Science Fiction, 1958)
* &quot;A Deskful of Girls&quot; (The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, 1958)
* &quot;Damnation Morning&quot; (Fantastic, 1959)
* &quot;No Great Magic&quot; (Galaxy, 1960)
* &quot;The Oldest Soldier&quot; (The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, 1960)
* &quot;When the Change-Winds Blow&quot; (The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, 1964)
* &quot;Knight to Move&quot; (Broadside, 1965)

All seven stories were collected in &quot;Changewar&quot; (Ace, 1983).

Poul Anderson employed the same basic theme - a war between two powerful factions, who confront each other throughout time and use people plucked from various periods as their soldiers - in his novel &quot;The Corridors of Time&quot; (1965).

<text>James Cochran Dobbin (January 17, 1814 – August 4, 1857) was a nineteenth-century politician and lawyer who served as United States Secretary of the Navy from 1853 to 1857.

Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1814, the grandson of congressman James Cochran, Dobbin attended Fayetteville Academy and the William Bingham School and later went on to graduate from the University of North Carolina in 1832. While at Carolina, Dobbin distinguished himself as a member of the Philanthropic Assembly. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1835, commencing practice in Fayetteville.

Dobbin later got involved in politics and was elected a Democrat to the twenty-ninth congress, serving from 1845 to 1847. He later served in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1848, 1850 and 1852, also serving as speaker of the house in 1850.

In 1852, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention where he helped secure the nomination of dark horse candidate Franklin Pierce for the presidency. Pierce appointed Dobbin United States Secretary of the Navy as a reward for his work in the presidential campaign. A firm believer in a strong Navy as an insurance for peace, Dobbin instituted reforms throughout the Navy. Eighteen of the finest ships of their class in the world were built during his tenure as Navy secretary. Under his auspices, the Perry expedition to Japan was carried to a successful termination and the treaty with that country signed. He ordered U.S. Navy Lieutenant Isaac Strain to command a U.S. Darién Exploring Expedition to map and survey the Darién Gap for a Panama Canal to link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

After his term as Navy secretary expired in 1857, Dobbin returned to Fayetteville where later that year he would die; he was interred at Cross Creek Cemetery in Fayetteville. He was memorialized when a ship, present at the attack of Pearl Harbor, was named in his honor the &quot;USS Dobbin (AD-3)&quot;.

<doc id="1088817" wikidata="Q391009" url="?curid=1088817" title="Religious order (Catholic)">
<text>In the Catholic Church, a religious order is a community of consecrated life with members that profess solemn vows. They are classed as a type of religious institute.

Subcategories of religious orders are:
* canons regular (canons and canonesses regular who recite the Divine Office and serve a church and perhaps a parish);
* clerics regular (priests who take religious vows and have an active apostolic life);
* mendicants (friars and religious sisters, possibly living and working in a friary or a convent, who live from alms, recite the Divine Office, and, in the case of the men, participate in apostolic activities); and
* monastics (monks and nuns living and working in a monastery or a nunnery and reciting the Divine Office).

Catholic religious orders began as early as the 500s, with the Order of Saint Benedict being formed in 529. The earliest orders include the Cistercians (1098), the Premonstratensians (1120), the Poor Clares founded by Francis of Assisi (1212), and the Benedictine reform movements of Cluny (1216). These orders were confederations of independent abbeys and priories, who were unified through a loose structure of leadership and oversight.

Later the mendicant orders such as the Carmelites, the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Preachers, the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and the Order of Saint Augustine formed. These Mendicant orders did not hold property for their Religious Communities, instead begging for alms and going where they were needed. Their leadership structure included each member, as opposed to each Abbey or House, as subject to their direct superior.

In the past, what distinguished religious orders from other institutes was the classification of the vows that the members took as solemn vows. According to this criterion, the last religious order founded was that of the Bethlehemite Brothers in 1673. Nevertheless, in the course of the 20th century, some religious institutes outside the category of orders obtained permission to make solemn vows, at least of poverty, thus blurring the distinction.

== Essential distinguishing mark ==
Solemn vows were originally considered indissoluble. As noted below, dispensations began to be granted in later times, but originally not even the Pope could dispense from them. If for a just cause a member of a religious order was expelled, the vow of chastity remained unchanged and so rendered invalid any attempt at marriage, the vow of obedience obliged in relation, generally, to the bishop rather than to the religious superior, and the vow of poverty was modified to meet the new situation but the expelled religious &quot;could not, for example, will any goods to another; and goods which came to him reverted at his death to his institute or to the Holy See.&quot;

=== Weakening of the distinction in 1917 ===
The former 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the term &quot;religious order&quot; for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term religious congregation (or simply congregation) for institutes with simple vows. The members of a religious order for men were called regulars, those belonging to a religious congregation were simply religious, a term that applied also to regulars. For women, those with simple vows were called religious sisters, with the term nun reserved in canon law for those who belonged to an institute of solemn vows, even if in some localities they were allowed to take simple vows instead.
However, it abolished the distinction according to which solemn vows, unlike simple vows, were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious vows and thereby abrogated for the Latin Church the special consecration that distinguished orders from congregations, while keeping some juridical distinctions.

In practice, even before 1917 dispensations from solemn religious vows were being obtained by grant of the Pope himself, while departments of the Holy See and superiors specially delegated by it could dispense from simple religious vows.

The 1917 Code maintained a juridical distinction by declaring invalid any marriage attempted by solemnly professed religious or by those with simple vows to which the Holy See had attached the effect of invalidating marriage, while stating that no simple vow rendered a marriage invalid, except in the cases in which the Holy See directed otherwise. Thus members of orders were barred absolutely from marriage, and any marriage they attempted was invalid. Those who made simple vows were obliged not to marry, but if they did break their vow, the marriage was considered valid.

Another difference was that a professed religious of solemn vows lost the right to own property and the capacity to acquire temporal goods for themselves, but a professed religious of simple vows, while being prohibited by the vow of poverty from using and administering property, kept ownership and the right to acquire more, unless the constitutions of the religious institute explicitly stated the contrary.

After publication of the 1917 Code, many institutes with simple vows appealed to the Holy See for permission to make solemn vows. The Apostolic Constitution &quot;Sponsa Christi&quot; of 21 November 1950 made access to that permission easier for nuns (in the strict sense), though not for religious institutes dedicated to apostolic activity. Many of these latter institutes of women then petitioned for the solemn vow of poverty alone. Towards the end of the Second Vatican Council, superiors general of clerical institutes and abbots president of monastic congregations were authorized to permit, for a just cause, their subjects of simple vows who made a reasonable request to renounce their property except for what would be required for their sustenance if they were to depart. These changes resulted in a further blurring of the previously clear distinction between orders and congregations, since institutes that were founded as congregations began to have some members who had all three solemn vows or had members that took a solemn vow of poverty and simple vows of chastity and obedience.

=== Further changes in 1983 ===
The current 1983 Code of Canon Law maintains the distinction between solemn and simple vows, but no longer makes any distinction between their juridical effects, including the distinction between orders and congregations. Instead, it uses the single term religious institute to designate all such institutes.

While solemn vows once meant those taken in what was called a religious order, &quot;today, in order to know when a vow is solemn it will be necessary to refer to the proper law of the institutes of consecrated life.&quot;

The &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; continues to distinguish between &quot;Ordini&quot; (Orders) and &quot;Congregazioni Religiose Clericali&quot; (Clerical Religious Congregations). Some other authors use the terms religious order and religious institute as synonyms; canon lawyer Nicholas Cafardi, commenting on the fact that the canonical term is religious institute, write that religious order is a colloquialism.

== Authority structure ==

A religious order is characterized by an authority structure where a superior general has jurisdiction over the order&#x27;s dependent communities. An exception is the Order of Saint Benedict which is not a religious order in this technical sense, because it has a system of independent houses, meaning that each abbey is autonomous. However, the constitutions governing the order&#x27;s global independent houses and its distinct Benedictine congregations (of which there are twenty) were approved by the pope. Likewise, according to rank and authority, the abbot primate&#x27;s &quot;position with regard to the other abbots [throughout the world] is to be understood rather from the analogy of a primate in a hierarchy than from that of the general of an order like the Dominicans and the Jesuits.&quot;

The Canons Regular of Saint Augustine are in a situation similar to that of the Benedictines. They are organized in eight congregations, each headed by an abbot general, but also have an Abbot Primate of the Confederated Canons Regular of Saint Augustine. And the Cistercians are in thirteen congregations, each headed by an abbot general or an abbot president, but do not use the title of abbot primate.

== List of religious orders of men in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;==

The &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; presents the list of male religious institutes in an &quot;Elenco Storio-Giuridico di Precedenza&quot; (&quot;Historical-juridical list of precedence&quot;). This list gives priority to certain types of institutes: Orders (divided into Canons Regular, monastics, mendicant orders, clerics regular), clerical religious congregations, lay religious congregations, Eastern religious congregations, secular institutes, societies of apostolic life. The list is found in the 1964 edition of the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;, pp. 807–870, where the heading is &quot;States of Perfection (of pontifical right for men)&quot;. In the 1969 edition the heading is &quot;Religious and Secular institutes of Pontifical Right for Men&quot;, a form it kept until 1975. Since 1976, when work was already advanced on revising the Code of Canon Law, the list has been qualified as &quot;historical-juridical&quot;.

== Religious orders of women in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot;==

The list of religious institutes for women in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; does not distinguish between orders (with solemn vows) and congregations (with simple vows). Many of the religious orders for men listed above have comparable religious institutes for women with solemn vows.

<doc id="1088835" wikidata="Q7281157" url="?curid=1088835" title="Radio fingerprinting">
<text>Radio fingerprinting is a process that identifies a cellular phone or any other radio transmitter by the &quot;fingerprint&quot; that characterizes its signal transmission and is hard to imitate. An electronic fingerprint makes it possible to identify a wireless device by its radio transmission characteristics. Radio fingerprinting is commonly used by cellular operators to prevent cloning of cell phones — a cloned device will have the same numeric equipment identity but a different radio fingerprint.

Essentially, each transmitter (cell phones are just one type of radio transmitter) has a rise time signature when first keyed which is caused by the slight variations of component values during manufacture. Once the rise time signature is captured and assigned to a callsign, the use of a different transmitter using the same callsign is easily detected. Such systems are used in military signals intelligence and by radio regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for identifying illegal transmitters. They are also used for assessing usage for billing purposes in Subscriber Mobile Radio (SMR) systems.

This topic has garnered great attention in recent years as the radio fingerprinting technique offers a &quot;physical layer&quot; authentication solution, which can provide fundamentally superior performance than traditional higher-layer encryption solutions. The topic has been studied by various researchers across multiple disciplines, including Signal Processing, Antenna and Propagation and Computer Science.

<doc id="1088843" wikidata="Q8059996" url="?curid=1088843" title="Yu Yu Hakusho Trading Card Game">
<text>The Yu Yu Hakusho Trading Card Game was first published in 2003 by Score Entertainment, and is based on the anime and manga series YuYu Hakusho (the series is spelled Yu Yu Hakusho in FUNimation&#x27;s anime version and spelled &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; in the Viz English manga). It is a two-player tournament-styled collectible card game; each player uses a deck of forty-four or more cards that is headed by a team of four character cards. The game was discontinued in 2005.

==Expansions==
Six expansions were released for the Yu Yu Hakusho TCG:
* Base Set
* Dark Tournament
* Gateway
* Exile
* Betrayal
* Alliance

Tournament cards were distributed at tournaments in special packs called spirit packs. Promotional cards could be acquired in many ways: buying magazines or DVDs, or attending tournaments or special events. Alliance did not have any tournament or promotional cards. In addition, special league cards could be acquired by joining a league.

In addition, a &quot;mystery card&quot; called &quot;The Dark One&quot; said to be the ultimate card, was printed. Three copies were initially given to each Score employee (many of which became hole punched). It had an attack of 99000 and the effect &quot;Since you work for Score you can choose a card in your hand or in play and change the effect of the card into anything you want for the remainder of the game.&quot; This instantly became one of the most sought after cards in the game when it was first revealed and a sold for over $1,000 on eBay prior to release. This one copy was placed on eBay by Score Entertainment to increase the hype for the upcoming events and tournament prizes, but the card was never widely released to the public as planned due to unforeseen complications. Almost 20 years later, an original copy of &quot;The Dark One&quot; is still widely considered to be the &quot;holy grail&quot; of the Yu Yu Hakusho trading card game and routinely sees sales between $2-$5k when it becomes possible to find one.

In November 2011, the initial Season 4 Blu-ray release by Funimation contained a reprinted, non-foil copy of &quot;The Dark One&quot;, printed by Panini, edited to allow use by the casual player.

==Gameplay==
The game is divided into five matches that consist of one-on-one fights between two character cards. The players alternate turns until one character is defeated, then move on to the next pair of characters. The game ends when one player wins three out of the five matches, or when one player cannot draw or discard a card from their deck. There are also a select few cards that allow one to win the game after performing a set amount of conditions.

===Card types===
; Characters : Representing characters from the anime and manga, there must be at least four of them in the deck. Four selected cards start on the field while the others (if there are any) stay in the deck. Some characters have a team symbol; if there are at least three characters with the same team symbol on the field, then the player can use a special bonus attributed to that team. Each card has a Defense score, at least one Attack, and an Alignment (Hero or Villain). Some have effects that can be used at various steps.
; Techniques : Each Technique card is a single attack that the player&#x27;s character can use during the Attack step.
; Items : Items boost a character&#x27;s attack or defense power, put the player&#x27;s opponent at a disadvantage, or aid the player in some other way, such as drawing additional cards or changing the player&#x27;s characters&#x27; positions in the Match Slots.
; Events : Representing plot twists in the anime, Event cards perform a wide variety of things. They are played and used during the Main Step, unless stated otherwise on the card.

===Field===
The playing field has nine places for cards and a Spirit Energy tracker on each side.

On the leftmost side is the Arena, where the currently fighting Characters are placed opposite each other. Attached Item cards are placed on the lower-left of the Character, and Techniques on the lower-right.

To the right of the Arena are the deck and the discard pile, and placed in a line going left-to-right are the three (or four) other Characters. (This is called the Sideline.) Above the Sideline is the Spirit Energy Tracker, which is simply 0 through 10 printed on the game mat. Included with each Starter Deck is a cardboard counter that is used to mark what level the player&#x27;s Spirit Energy is, but any sort of counter (coins, pebbles, etc.) can be used.

===Setup===
The player and their opponent start the game with zero Spirit Energy. The player selects four characters from their deck and chooses one to place in the Arena section of the field; this one will fight the first match. The other three are placed face-down in a line to the right of the deck and discard, with the character that will fight next leftmost. Once the character cards of both players have been placed, the player turns them all right-side up.

The player should shuffle the deck and place it on the field, then flip a coin to determine who goes first. Both players then draw 4 cards from the top of their decks.

===Step 1: Draw===
#Unless this is the first turn of the game, the player draws two cards.
#The player gains two Spirit Energy. (The Spirit Energy Tracker is raised by two points.) Spirit Energy can go up to ten, but not above it, and drop to zero (0), but not below it.

Any cards&#x27; effects with &quot;Draw:&quot; can be used during this step.

===Step 2: Main===
The player may take any of these actions during this step:
*Place a 5th character card from their hand onto the last unoccupied Match Slot. (There are only four Match Slots, so if the player has more than five characters in their deck, they should choose their fifth fighter carefully.)
*Attach an item from their hand to one of their characters.
*Attach a technique from their hand to one of their characters.
*Play an event from their hand.
*Use an effect from a card already in play that can be used during this step. (That is, starts with &quot;Main:&quot;)

Alternatively, the player may do nothing at all, and go straight to the Attack step.

If a card the player is attaching to a fighter has one or more Spirit Energy icons on it, then they must spend that number of Spirit Energy and lower their Tracker accordingly. However, when the player attaches a card to a character on the Sideline, they should place it facedown under the character and therefore they will not pay any costs. The only time the player will pay costs is when the attached cards are flipped face-up on either the Sidelines or while entering the Arena. If the costs cannot be paid, the card must be discarded.

===Step 3: Attack===
The player uses one attack during this step. Attacks are done in this order, to prevent confusion:

#The player states which attack their character is using, either from their own card or from an attached Technique, and pay its cost.
#The player may use cards and effects that have the phrase &quot;when you use an attack&quot; in their text now.
#If the player&#x27;s attack has an effect, it is used now.
#Cards with effects that are prefixed with &quot;Attack:&quot; on them may be used now.
#The player compares the final Attack and Defense values. If the Attack is equal to or greater than the Defense, then 1 point of damage is dealt. If the Attack is twice the Defense or more, 2 points of damage are dealt instead. Unless stated by a card effect, no more than 2 points of damage can be dealt a turn.
#If no damage would be dealt, the player may discard 2 cards from their hand in order to deal 1 point of damage.
#The defender turns the damaged character ninety degrees clockwise for each point of damage. Alternatively when you are healing points of damage, turn the damaged character ninety degrees counter clockwise for every 1 point of damaged healed. You can not make your characters HP higher than four unless specifically stated by a card effect.

Once a character has taken four points of damage (thus returning it to its original position), both fighters are moved off the main playing field, and the winner is placed face-up and the loser face-down. Any cards attached to them are discarded. The next-in-line in the Match Slots are then moved to the Arena, any attached cards are flipped face-up and any costs for those cards are paid now.

==Discontinuation==
The game, which started in 2003 and ended in 2005, was discontinued for various reasons. One of the reasons was that each subsequent expansion of cards greatly overpowered the previous sets (see power creep). Cards in later sets had effects and power values which would have been considered overly powerful in the beginning. There were also cards that distorted the game and, with the right deck compilation, allowed you to win in a single turn without even allowing your opponent to have a turn. Some players believed Score did not act swiftly enough to ban or issue errata to these cards. The most notable change was when Israel &quot;I.Q.&quot; Quiroz, then head designer quit the game due to creative differences with the playtesting and development team.

After leaving Score Entertainment Israel Quiroz was accused of cheating in the draft portion of the GenCon 04 realms tournament when his deck was found to have too many ghost rares and rares possible for a deck. While opening packs he called the judge, Scott Sager, to inform and show him that one of the packs opened had an extra ghost rare. When brought to the attention of the tournament judge, Scott Sager, the claims were immediately dismissed. Quiroz&#x27;s team then went on to take second in the tournament.

==Reception==
The &quot;YuYu Hakusho Trading Card Game&quot; was voted the Best Trading Card Game of 2003 by &quot;Inquest Gamer Magazine&quot;.
