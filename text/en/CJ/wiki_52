<text>Sean Michael Coulthard (born December 8, 1968), better known by his ring name Michael Cole, is an American professional wrestling commentator and journalist. Since 1997, he is signed to WWE, where he serves as the play-by-play commentator for the Raw brand and as the vice president of announcing since 2020. 

Coulthard began his career in journalism in 1988 for CBS Radio before being hired by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1997 (WWF was renamed WWE in 2002). He has performed multiple on-screen hosting and commentary roles across his two-decade-plus-long career.

==Early life and education ==
Sean Michael Coulthard was born on December 8, 1966, in Syracuse, New York. He attended the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, graduating in 1988 with a B.A. in broadcast journalism.

==Journalism career==
Coulthard began his career in the media as a journalist, working for CBS Radio. His first high-profile assignment was to cover the 1988 US presidential campaign of Democratic Party nominee Michael Dukakis. In 1992, he reported on the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. He also covered the 51-day siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, and the following year, spent nine months covering the Yugoslavian civil war. In 1995, he was also selected to cover the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing. He returned to the presidential campaign trail in 1996 to cover the campaigns of Steve Forbes and Sen. Bob Dole.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1997–present)===

====Backstage interviewer and &quot;Raw&quot; (1997–1999)====
Coulthard came to the World Wrestling Federation in mid early-1997 after being recommended to company officials by Todd Pettengill, and started using the stage name &quot;Michael Cole&quot;. He provided voice-overs for promotional videos and later became the host of the &quot;LiveWire show&quot;. Cole first appeared on screen at the June 30, 1997 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, interviewing The Legion of Doom and replaced Todd Pettengill as a backstage interviewer after SummerSlam. In late 1997, Cole became one of the three announcers for the first hour of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, alongside Jim Ross and Kevin Kelly. Eventually, Cole was permanently replaced by Jerry Lawler in mid-1998. In December 1998, Cole became the regular play-by-play announcer for &quot;Raw is War&quot;, subbing for Jim Ross when Ross was ill with Bell&#x27;s palsy. He continued in this role until WrestleMania XV in March 1999.

====&quot;SmackDown!&quot; (1999–2008)====
When the promotion&#x27;s new &quot;SmackDown!&quot; television program debuted later that year, Cole was chosen to be the show&#x27;s play-by-play announcer. Lawler was his original broadcast partner, but when Lawler briefly left the WWF in 2001, he was replaced by Cole&#x27;s &quot;WWF Sunday Night Heat&quot; broadcast partner Tazz shortly before the WWF vs. WCW/ECW invasion storyline. After the WWE Brand Extension, Cole worked exclusively for the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand, cutting down to doing play-by-play on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;-only pay-per-views, while &quot;Raw&quot;-only pay-per-views were announced by Raw&#x27;s announce team.

Cole was rarely involved in storylines; however, he has had minor roles in storylines involving Heidenreich, Stephanie McMahon, Vito, and D-Generation X (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and Rick Rude). His 2004 angle with Heidenreich was infamous due to an implied scene where Heidenreich &quot;Heidenraped&quot; him in the arena restroom; in a 2008 interview, Heidenreich explained that the Cole rape angle was McMahon&#x27;s idea and that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; came to mind when Stephanie McMahon approached him with the idea. He called play-by-play at the 2006 Royal Rumble match because Jim Ross, who had commentated the last two Royal Rumble matches with Tazz, had been (kayfabe) &quot;fired&quot; and replaced by former ECW play-by-play man Joey Styles, reuniting the original &quot;SmackDown!&quot; team of Cole and Jerry Lawler. On February 3, 2006, it was announced that Cole and Tazz were starting a radio show on Howard Stern&#x27;s Howard 100 on Sirius Satellite Radio, but the show was a trial run that only lasted a couple of weeks.

On the June 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Cole&#x27;s broadcast partner Tazz left &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to ECW, leaving Cole at that moment without a broadcast partner. Two days later at ECW One Night Stand, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) announced he would replace Tazz as color commentator. After JBL left the broadcast booth and returned to wrestling on &quot;Raw&quot;, Jonathan Coachman became Cole&#x27;s new partner on the January 4, 2008 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Coachman was then replaced by Mick Foley, beginning at Backlash.

====Return to &quot;Raw&quot; (2008–2009)====
As part of the 2008 WWE Draft, Cole was drafted to the Raw brand as Jim Ross was drafted to the SmackDown brand, ending Cole&#x27;s nearly 10-year run as a play-by-play commentator on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On the July 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cole was attacked by Kane, who repeatedly asked Cole &quot;Is he alive or dead?&quot; before Cole was saved by Jerry Lawler. Cole made his in-ring debut on the July 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, teaming with Lawler against Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase for the World Tag Team Championship, but they lost after Cole inadvertently tagged himself in and was quickly pinned by Rhodes after a lariat. 

====Heel turn and feud with Jerry Lawler (2010–2012)====

Cole was the lead commentator for &quot;WWE NXT&quot; for its first three seasons, and during the first season in 2010, Cole began showing signs of arrogance and cockiness towards face wrestlers and WWE fans alike, turning heel for the first time in his WWE career. He also began to belittle Daniel Bryan and took a liking to The Miz, leading to confrontations with Bryan throughout the season. Meanwhile, on the Raw brand, Cole was made the official spokesman for the Anonymous Raw General Manager on June 21. On October 1, Cole returned to &quot;SmackDown&quot; to join Matt Striker and Todd Grisham on commentary, and branded himself the &quot;Voice of the WWE&quot;, stating that he should be on all WWE shows going forward. 
On the November 29, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cole interfered in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWE Championship between Jerry Lawler and The Miz, costing Lawler the match and helping The Miz retain his title. This began a feud with Lawler that built towards a match at WrestleMania XXVII. During this time, Cole revealed Jack Swagger as his trainer and antagonized Lawler with antics such as making light of his mother&#x27;s death and inviting his son Brian Lawler to air family secrets. At WrestleMania on April 3, special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin announced Lawler won the match, but the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision and declared Cole the winner by disqualification, due to Austin being involved in the match. On May 1, at Extreme Rules, Cole teamed with Swagger to defeat Jim Ross and Lawler in a Country Whipping match. Lawler and Cole had a final &quot;Kiss My Foot&quot; match at Over the Limit on May 22, which Cole lost; after the match, Bret Hart returned and put Cole in his signature submission move, the Sharpshooter, to help Lawler make Cole kiss his foot. Cole apologized to Lawler the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, ending their feud. 

Cole continued to wrestle sporadically after this and still favored most heels while questioning the actions of the faces to regain control in matches. On the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H placed Cole in a match against Zack Ryder, which Cole lost quickly. Cole and Alberto Del Rio lost a tag team match to John Cena and Jim Ross on the October 17 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, prompting Cole to challenge Ross to the &quot;Michael Cole Challenge&quot; (a series of three contests); Cole said that if Ross won each challenge, Cole would quit his job. During the challenge on the November 14 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Ross won the first two challenges (arm wrestling and dancing), causing Cole to declare that the third contest was who weighed less, which Cole won. Ross was subsequently fired and CM Punk came out and attacked Cole; Cole vowed revenge and said he would sue Punk for injuring him. On January 29, Cole was a surprise entrant in the 2012 Royal Rumble match, but was quickly eliminated by Lawler, Booker T, and the returning Kharma. Cole was put in a match with John Cena on the June 4, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, but lost and was forced to make an apology for all of his wrongdoings.

On the July 9 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Cole was booked against Jerry Lawler in a WrestleMania XXVII rematch, which he quickly lost. The Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision, making Cole the winner by disqualification following interference by Booker T, but then Santino Marella then came out and pulled out Hornswoggle from hiding underneath the ring, claiming that he was the Anonymous Raw General Manager.

====Face turn (2012–present)====
Cole was lauded for his handling of his fellow commentary partner Jerry Lawler&#x27;s legitimate on-air heart attack on the September 10, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Despite being a heel commentator for two years, Cole provided updates to television viewers on Lawler&#x27;s condition throughout the episode. He was praised for his handling of the emergency, turning face as he began favoring the face wrestlers and began receiving cheers. Cole also joined in commentary during &quot;Raw&quot; and pay-per-view events, including Night of Champions and Hell in a Cell by Jim Ross and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). On the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cole cemented his face turn when he hugged the returning Lawler in the ring.On the March 30, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cole, along with JBL and Booker T, was attacked by Brock Lesnar after Seth Rollins refused Lesnar his WWE World Heavyweight Championship rematch. Cole did not appear on commentary the following week as part of a storyline injury. On June 8, Cole welcomed Byron Saxton as the color commentator for &quot;Raw&quot;, replacing Booker T. On the January 15, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Cole was attacked by Braun Strowman due to Strowman&#x27;s anger at being fired by General Manager Kurt Angle and was subsequently replaced by Tom Phillips for the remainder of the broadcast.

On September 26, 2019, WWE announced as a part of their &quot;WWE Premiere Week&quot; that a new commentary team would be on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Cole returned to &quot;SmackDown&quot; as a full-time commentator for the first time in six years, appearing alongside former &quot;Raw&quot; commentators Corey Graves and Renee Young. He was joined on commentary with Pat McAfee on April 16, 2021. McAfee eventually took a break to work for ESPN&#x27;s College Gameday, and Cole would be joined by Wade Barrett on commentary for &quot;SmackDown&quot; and for premium live events with Graves.

On August 5, 2023, WWE went with more on-air commentary changes as Cole returned to &quot;Raw&quot; on August 7, with Wade Barrett joining him on commentary. He remained on &quot;SmackDown&quot; as Corey Graves would be returning on commentary with Kevin Patrick joining in. On January 1, 2024, Cole left &quot;SmackDown&quot; again, leaving Patrick and Graves as the two-man commentary team and was rejoined by Pat McAfee on &quot;Raw&quot; later that month.

With &quot;SmackDown&quot; returning to USA Network on September 13, 2024, Cole was replaced by the debuting Joe Tessitore on &quot;Raw&quot; on September 2, while McAfee is on hiatus due to his involvement on ESPN College Gameday. However, Cole and McAfee are expected to return to &quot;Raw&quot; upon its series premiere on Netflix, which acquired the rights to &quot;Raw&quot; in January 2024, starting January 6, 2025.

From 2020 onwards, Cole has engaged in longstanding feuds on commentary against Bayley, with whom he has had issues in storyline over the past few years, Top Dolla, whom Cole called out for a botched top rope spot on an episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and Dominik Mysterio, whom Cole sides against in Dominik&#x27;s feud with his father Rey Mysterio.

===Reality of Wrestling (2013)===
In December 2013, Cole served as a special guest announcer for fellow WWE employee Booker T&#x27;s professional wrestling promotion Reality of Wrestling, along with Rich Brennan (formerly known as Anthony Pratt and Rich Bocchini).

==Legacy==

Legendary professional wrestling commentator, WWE Hall of Famer and former broadcast partner colleague Jim Ross has praised Cole: &quot;Michael works his ass off. He&#x27;s a good family man, he&#x27;s a company man, he works diligently to do his job. I respect him for all those things. I&#x27;ve always liked him, he&#x27;s a good dude, and folks won&#x27;t understand that. They only judge him for his television persona, rightly or wrongly. It&#x27;s kind of frustrating&quot;. PWInsider&#x27;s Dave Scherer called Cole &quot;The GOAT (Greatest of All Time)&quot;, praising his work under Vince McMahon&#x27;s pressure. Nigel McGuinness also praised Cole, pointing how many things he learned from him.

==Other media==
Cole has appeared as a commentator in numerous WWE video games, providing his voice. He has also appeared as a non-playable character in several and is a playable character in &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;, &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot; as an unlockable character and &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot; as a downloadable character. 

Cole has also appeared in Activision&#x27;s Call of Duty Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty Warzone as Himself. He announced finish moves for the featured wrestler operator skins of Rhea Ripley, Rey Mysterio and Cody Rhodes, as well as other various voice lines in the game, including a variation of Team Deathmatch called &quot;Slam Deathmatch&quot;.

Cole appeared on the September 12, 2012 episode of &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; to address fellow WWE commentator Jerry Lawler&#x27;s heart attack that occurred during the September 10 live broadcast of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==Personal life==
Coulthard has been married to Yolanda since 1987 and together they have two sons. After being joined on commentary by Preston North End supporter Wade Barrett, Cole was photographed alongside Barrett in a Preston kit and expressed his support for the team on X.

<text>Australian constitutional law is the area of the law of Australia relating to the interpretation and application of the Constitution of Australia. Legal cases regarding Australian constitutional law are often handled by the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the Australian judicial system. Several major doctrines of Australian constitutional law have developed.

==Background==

Constitutional law in the Commonwealth of Australia consists mostly of that body of doctrine which interprets the Commonwealth Constitution. The Constitution itself is embodied in clause 9 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, which was passed by the British Parliament in 1900 after its text had been negotiated in Australian Constitutional Conventions in the 1890s and approved by the voters in each of the Australian colonies. The British government did, however, insist on one change to the text, to allow a greater range of appeals to the Privy Council in London. It came into force on 1 January 1901, at which time the Commonwealth of Australia came into being.

The Constitution created a framework of government some of whose main
features, and sources of inspiration, were the following:

*constitutional monarchy (British and existing colonial models)
* federalism (United States model)
* parliamentary, or &quot;responsible&quot;, government (British and existing colonial models)
*distinct textual separation of powers (US model)
*direct election to both Houses of Parliament (then a novelty)
*Governor-General as a representative of a monarch (existing colonial models, notably Canada)
*requirement of a referendum for amendment of the Constitution (Swiss model)
*only very limited guarantees of personal rights (rejection of the US model)
* judicial review (US model)

== The Constitution and the High Court ==

The process of judicial review – the ability of The High Court of Australia to declare legislation unconstitutional and therefore invalid – has its origin in American experience, where the right of the Supreme Court of the United States to strike down legislation deemed incompatible with the Constitution was first asserted by the Supreme Court itself in the seminal case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; in 1803. Although completely foreign to both British and Australian colonial experience, the framers of the Australian Constitution clearly intended that the practice would take hold in Australia, and even expressly adverted to it in the Constitutional text (in section 76). This power of judicial review of legislation for conformity with the Constitution has been exercised almost exclusively by the High Court of Australia, and almost invariably with a full bench of all its members, such as in the Communist Party case. Influence from American jurisprudence has occurred in specific cases.

A brief overview of the other listed features will provide a background for the doctrinal developments examined below.

==Constitutional monarchy==

Australia is a constitutional monarchy. Although the term &quot;Head of State&quot; is not used in the Constitution, it was intended that the Commonwealth (like the colonies) would continue to recognise the British Sovereign. &quot;The Queen&quot; (meaning Queen Victoria, defined to include &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom&quot;), was one of the three elements of Parliament, along with the Senate and the House of Representatives (section 1). Today, the King of Australia has replaced the King of the United Kingdom within Australia&#x27;s parliament, but they happen to be the same person. The Monarch is represented in Australia by an appointed Governor-General. The executive power is vested in the Governor-General &quot;as the Queen&#x27;s representative&quot; (section 61), as is the command-in-chief of the armed forces (section 68).

The Australian Constitution provides the Governor-General with a number of powers, including; the power to dissolve Parliament (Sections 5, 57), the power to refuse assent to bills presented to her (section 58) and the power to dismiss the government Ministers (section 64)., however, the practical use of such powers is restricted by constitutional convention, which mandate the Governor General to act on ministerial advice, except in exceptional circumstances. Because the conventions are not written in The Constitution, the limits of the Governor General&#x27;s powers are unclear. Convention does, however, allow The Governor General to exercise some powers without ministerial advice in exceptional circumstances. These powers are known as &quot;reserve powers&quot;.

The reserve powers allow The Governor General to commission a Prime Minister when no party, or coalition of parties has a majority of seats in The House of Representatives and the power to dismiss a Prime Minister, who has been subject to a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives.

The reserve powers may also include the power to dismiss a Prime Minister who is engaging in persistent illegal action (Governor Sir Philip Game of New South Wales dismissed Premier Jack Lang on this ground in 1932). However, it remains controversial whether they include the power to dismiss a Prime Minister who, while retaining the confidence of the House of Representatives, is not able to get the annual supply Bill passed by the Senate, as happened during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 when the Governor-General acted against the advice of Ministers.

The role of the Monarch is today even more circumscribed and amounts only to appointing (and, in theory, dismissing) a Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister, as well as performing (by invitation) certain ceremonial functions when personally present in Australia. See Constitutional history of Australia for further details on the development of the monarch&#x27;s role in relation to Australia.

The importance of constitutional conventions in this area means that Australia cannot be said, strictly, to operate entirely under a written constitution, but has to some extent a system like the British unwritten constitution. However, it would be a mistake to exaggerate the importance of this aspect of Australia&#x27;s constitutional arrangements:

*the reliance on constitutional convention is confined almost entirely to the relations between the Queen/Governor-General and the Ministers of State; and
*more completely written constitutional systems also develop binding conventions: for instance, popular election to the Electoral College of the United States, though not mandated by the United States Constitution, has probably become a binding norm.

==Federalism==

===Division of powers===

The Constitution sets up the Commonwealth of Australia as a federal polity, with enumerated limited specific powers conferred on the Federal Parliament. The State Parliaments are not assigned specific enumerated powers; rather the powers of their predecessor colonial Parliaments are continued except insofar as they are expressly withdrawn or vested exclusively in the Federal Parliament by the Constitution. The framers rejected an alternative model, the Canadian, which has been described as &quot;an allocation of exclusive powers to both levels of government, not concurrent powers.&quot;

The bulk of enumerated powers are contained in section 51 and section 52. Section 52 powers are &#x27;exclusive&#x27; to the Commonwealth (although some section 51 powers are in practice necessarily exclusive, such as the power with respect to borrowing money on the public credit of the Commonwealth in paragraph (iv), and the power to legislate with respect to matters referred to the Commonwealth by a State in paragraph (xxxvii)). By contrast, the subjects in section 51 can be legislated on by both state and Commonwealth parliaments. However, in the event of inconsistency or an intention by the Commonwealth to cover the field the Commonwealth law prevails (section 109).

Both concurrent (section 51) and exclusive (section 52) powers are stated to be &quot;subject to this Constitution&quot;. As a result, the Commonwealth&#x27;s law-making power is subject to the limitations and guarantees in the Constitution (both express and implied). For example, section 99 forbids the Commonwealth from giving preference to any State or part of a State &quot;by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue&quot;. And as discussed below, an implied guarantee of freedom of political communication has been held to limit the Commonwealth&#x27;s power to regulate political discourse.

The list of powers assigned to the Federal Parliament is quite similar to that assigned by the United States Constitution to the Congress, but is in some respects broader: for instance, it includes &quot;astronomical and meteorological observations&quot;, marriage and divorce, and interstate industrial relations. The interpretation of similar heads of power – for instance the Trade and Commerce Power in Australia and the Commerce Clause in the US – has in some cases been different.

The constitution also provides some opportunities for Federal-State co-operation: any State can &quot;refer&quot; a &quot;matter&quot; to the Commonwealth Parliament, and the Commonwealth Parliament can exercise, &quot;at the request or with the concurrence of the Parliaments of all the States directly concerned&quot;, any power which, at the time of Federation, could be exercised only by the British Parliament.

===Parliamentary structures===
Representation in the House of Representatives is based on population and ‘original states’ have equal numbers in the Senate. The two houses are equal in power except for certain restrictions in financial matters. For example, the Senate may not amend a supply Bill, although as the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 demonstrates, it may defer or refuse to pass such a Bill altogether; Bills to impose taxation or appropriate revenue may not originate in the Senate; and the Senate may not amend a Bill so as to increase taxation.

Again, federalism is evident in the process of constitutional amendment, which requires that the Bill to amend the Constitution be approved by a majority of electors overall &quot;and&quot; a majority of electors in a majority of States (that is, four out of the six).

Additionally, amendments &quot;altering the limits&quot; of a State or diminishing its proportional representation in Parliament require the approval of electors in that State.

==Parliamentary government==
It was assumed by the framers, in line with British and local colonial tradition, that the executive government would consist of Ministers who were members of Parliament and &quot;responsible&quot;, that is, answerable, to it, and that the continued existence of the government would depend on it maintaining the confidence in the House of Representatives.

These arrangements, however, are only hinted at in the text of the Constitution. There is a requirement (section 64) that the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Ministers of State&quot;, who are nominally appointed by the Governor-General, be or swiftly become members of either House of Parliament. The existence of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the requirement for them to have the confidence of the House of Representatives, are not mentioned. Nonetheless, these have been fundamental features of Australian constitutional practice from the start. More recently, the principle of responsible government was reinforced by the High Court of Australia which upheld orders for a Minister of the government to table documents in the NSW Legislative Council after he refused to do so.

==Separation of powers==

The Constitution features a distinct separation of powers. Legislative power is dealt with in Chapter I, and is vested in the Federal Parliament (section 1). Executive power is dealt with in Chapter II, and is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen&#x27;s representative (section 61). The judicature is dealt with in Chapter III, and is vested in the Federal High Court and &quot;in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction&quot; (section 71).

However, the Queen is an element of the Parliament as well as being head of the executive; and the Ministers of State who &quot;advise&quot; the Governor-General are actually &quot;required&quot; to be or become members of Parliament.

While there is no significant separation of the legislative and executive powers (the &quot;political branches&quot;), the High Court has developed an increasingly stringent doctrine of the separation of the judicial power from the other two.

==Direct election to both Houses of Parliament==
The Constitution required direct election of members to both Houses of Parliament from the beginning (sections 7 and 24). This was a novelty at the time, since the national upper houses with which the framers were best acquainted were chosen by other means: indirect election by the State legislatures (United States Senate before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913), executive appointment for life (Senate of Canada), or a combination of appointment for life and hereditary succession (British House of Lords).

==Referendum for constitutional amendment==

The text of the Constitution was not presented to the British Parliament for formal enactment until it had been approved by the electors of the colonies.

On the same principle, any amendment to the Constitution requires approval at a referendum, by the process set out in section 128 of the Constitution. A double majority – a majority of electors and of a majority of states – is required.

Constitutional referendums were based on the Swiss practice. However, the Swiss use of the popular initiative in constitutional amendment was not followed, so that constitutional alterations, although they must be approved by the people, can only be initiated by Parliament.

The use of the referendum in initially adopting the Constitution, and its requirement for constitutional amendment, has been cited by justices of the High Court to argue that the Constitution is fundamentally based on popular sovereignty (rather than on the supremacy of the British Parliament, which is its technical legal foundation). This doctrine has achieved greater prominence since the cessation, in 1986, of all authority of that Parliament over Australia: see Constitutional history of Australia for details.

There have been 44 proposals for constitutional amendment put to the people since Federation. Of these, only 8 have passed.

==Growth of federal power==
Probably the most obvious development in Australian constitutional law has been the steady growth in the power of the federal government relative to the states. Several factors could account for this, including:
*doctrines of constitutional interpretation which favour a broad reading of Commonwealth powers
*the &quot;fiscal imbalance&quot; between the Commonwealth and the States (see Constitutional basis of taxation in Australia)
*the development of new areas of competence which did not exist at Federation, and which have fallen to the Commonwealth
*the growing importance of legislative areas that were always Commonwealth powers (for example, external affairs and trading corporations)
*constitutional amendment or referral by the States
*the willingness of Australian governments, including supporters of States&#x27; rights, to exercise their powers to the full

===Centralising interpretations===

====Reserved State powers doctrine and the Engineers case====

Prior to 1920 the &quot;reserved State powers&quot; doctrine and &quot;implied inter-governmental immunities&quot; were used to preserve state power. Reserved state powers holds that the Constitution should be read in a restrictive way so as to preserve as much autonomy as possible for the States. Implied intergovernmental immunities holds that Commonwealth and States are immune to each other&#x27;s laws and cannot mutually regulate each other&#x27;s governmental apparatus.

In 1920, the Engineer&#x27;s case (after changes in the composition of the Court) swept away this doctrine. The court now insisted on adhering only to interpreting a statute &quot;expounded according to the intent of the Parliament that made it; and that intention has to be found by an examination of the language used in the statute as a whole&quot;. There was to be no reading in of implications by reference to the presumed intentions of the framers.

As a result, the constitution is no longer read in a way which attempts to preserve the power of the states.

====Broad interpretation of Commonwealth powers====
Even before the Engineer&#x27;s case, a line of judicial reasoning asserted that Commonwealth powers should be interpreted broadly rather than narrowly wherever possible.

After &quot;Engineers&quot;, this approach was reinforced. For example, Section 109, regarding inconsistency between Commonwealth and State laws, was broadly interpreted. Commonwealth law prevails not only where inconsistent obligations are imposed, but where Commonwealth legislation evinces an intention to &quot;cover the field&quot; by being the whole law on a particular subject. The Commonwealth can &quot;manufacture&quot; inconsistency by expressly stating that its legislation is intended to cover the field. However, an issue that was raised, without being conclusively resolved, in the Workplace Relations Challenge was whether the Commonwealth can &quot;clear the field&quot; by stating an intention that State laws are not to apply even if the Commonwealth does not enact other laws in their place.

The Commonwealth can only legislate with respect to an enumerated head of power, This does not mean that the law must be solely, or even predominantly, directed at that head of power. As long as it can be &quot;fairly characterized&quot; as a law with respect to an enumerated power, it is irrelevant that it could also be categorised as a law regarding some other subject matter.

Likewise, Parliament&#x27;s &quot;motivation&quot; in passing the law is irrelevant. An example is environmental legislation. The Constitution does not provide the Commonwealth Parliament with any power to control the environment or its use. Nonetheless, a very broad-ranging environmental protection Act could be passed relying on a combination of powers such as interstate and international trade, corporations, taxation, foreign affairs and so on. The law can be supported by those powers although Parliament intended it to be an &#x27;environmental law&#x27;. Particularly in the last two decades, many Acts of very wide-ranging effect have been passed on just these bases, in fields as diverse as environment protection, privacy, and anti-discrimination, fields in which the Commonwealth has no &quot;direct&quot; power.

===Fiscal imbalance===

At the time of Federation, the colonies&#x27; main source of revenue consisted of customs and excise duties (income tax being still a newer notion). Since one of the main reasons for Federation was to create a common market, inevitably authority over these taxes was vested exclusively in the Commonwealth Parliament (section 90). It was acknowledged that this would create a situation where the Commonwealth would raise much more money than it could spend, whereas the States, being still responsible for most areas of law and of social infrastructure, would need to spend much more money than they could raise (the problem now known as &quot;vertical fiscal imbalance&quot;). Although the framers were able to agree on a formula for distribution of the Commonwealth&#x27;s surplus to the States in the first few years after Federation, they could not agree on a long-term formula. Accordingly, section 96 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth Parliament &quot;may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit&quot;.

One result of this has been that the Commonwealth has been able to make grants to the States on terms so specific as to amount to the virtual takeover of particular fields of competence. For instance, although the Constitution gives the Commonwealth no express power over education, by means of &quot;tied grants&quot; it has in fact become paramount in the field of tertiary education. Although any state has the option to refuse a grant, the consequences of doing so make this unattractive. Similarly, the Commonwealth has become dominant in the field of public hospitals, and a major player in the field of roads and other major infrastructure.

The Commonwealth has also come to monopolise income tax. Once the advantages of income tax were recognised, both the Commonwealth and the States levied income taxes. However, during World War II, the Commonwealth government decided to take over the collection of income taxes and return some proceeds to the States as grants. The Commonwealth passed legislation to levy income tax at a nationwide rate similar to the previous combination of Commonwealth tax and the various state taxes. Separate legislation then granted section 96 monetary grants to states if the State did not levy income taxes. In practice, it would be difficult for States to continue taxing.

This arrangement was twice challenged by the States in the High Court and twice upheld. In the Second Uniform Tax case the taxation part of the scheme was held to be valid based on the taxation power, and the grants held to be valid on the basis of the words &#x27;terms and conditions&#x27; of section 96.

States are also at the mercy of the High Court&#x27;s definition of an &quot;excise duty,&quot; which states cannot levy. The High Court has long stated the definition in terms such as &quot;an inland tax on a step in production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods&quot;. However, it does not include a mere fee for a licence to carry on a particular business or profession. Accordingly, the States had for a long time levied, with the compliance of the High Court, &quot;business franchise fees&quot; on retailers of products, particularly liquor and tobacco products.

These &quot;franchise fees&quot; were mostly calculated according to the value of the retailer&#x27;s sales in a specific &quot;preceding&quot; period, rather than on the value of goods currently being sold. Although these seem similar to excise duties, a series of High Court precedents had effectively &quot;quarantined&quot; such fees from disallowance in the areas of liquor retailing, tobacco retailing, and petrol distribution. In 1997, by a bare majority, the High Court decided that this area of doctrinal quarantine was incoherent with the rest of the law relating to excise duties and removed it.
 The immediate result was the loss of some $5 billion (Australian) in the annual revenues of the States and Territories.

In 1999, the Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation introducing a new broad-based Federal indirect tax, the Goods and Services Tax; the revenue from this tax was to go entirely to the States and Territories in exchange for abolishing a range of other indirect taxes. By this stage, the financial dependence of the States on the Commonwealth had become almost complete.

===New areas of competence===
The development of various technologies during the twentieth century also added to the power of the centre. Section 51(v) of the Australian Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament power over &quot;postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services&quot;. With little controversy, this power now covers radio, television, satellite, cable, and optic fibre technologies.

A greater struggle occurred over Commonwealth legislation in the field of aviation. Commonwealth regulation is based on the interstate and international trade and commerce power. Prima facie, it does not cover intrastate aviation. However, a purely intrastate aviation industry is no longer economically feasible and separate systems of state regulation pose safety concerns. As a result, the High Court held that all aviation has an interstate character, placing it within Commonwealth legislative power. In 1937 a referendum was submitted to the people giving the Commonwealth power over aviation, and that the referendum was rejected by the people. The rejection of a power by the people has never persuaded the Court that the Commonwealth should not exercise the power.

Another example concerns intellectual property. Although the Constitution gave the Commonwealth Parliament power over &quot;copyrights, patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks&quot;, the enormous growth of electronic media content has given this power a much wider scope than could possibly have been envisaged at Federation.

===New powers===
The Commonwealth power has been extended by four constitutional amendments. An amendment in 1910 and an amendment in 1928 allowed the Commonwealth to take over and manage state debts. An amendment passed in 1967 gave the Commonwealth power over Aboriginal affairs, which has had a significant effect particularly in the pastoral and central regions of Australia.

An amendment passed in 1946 gave the Commonwealth power to provide a wide range of social services. This included unemployment and sickness benefits, maternity allowances, child endowment, and medical and dental services. Apart from defence, social services is the largest area of Commonwealth expenditure. Along with the grants power, it is the basis for the Medicare scheme of universal health insurance.

The High Court decided that the corporations power was not broad enough to cover incorporation itself. This decision threatened the validity of Australian companies incorporated under commonwealth law. The states used &#x27;the referral power&#x27; to refer the power over incorporation to the Commonwealth Parliament.

===The external affairs power===

The Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament power over &quot;external affairs&quot;. Originally this power had little content, because Australia&#x27;s foreign relations were managed by the United Kingdom. As Australia gained independence and international personality, so did the significance of this power.

Australia&#x27;s relations with other countries fall directly under the subject of external affairs. It includes relations with other British Dominions and further extends to relations with international organisations. The pursuit and advancement of friendliness with foreign governments is another vital aspect under the external affairs power. The High Court has held that the power covers the regulation of conduct that takes place outside Australia, suggesting that mere externality to Australia could enliven the power. In particular, Commonwealth legislation of 1998 that retroactively criminalised war crimes committed during World War II in Europe by Australian citizens was held a valid exercise of the external affairs power.

The power has also been held to extend to the implementation of international treaties, even if the subject matter of the treaty is otherwise not within Commonwealth power. In the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen, the High Court found that the Commonwealth had the power to implement the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the form of the Racial Discrimination Act. In the case of Tasmanian Dams Case, the High Court has upheld Commonwealth legislation forbidding the Tasmanian government from proceeding with a dam that would have submerged an area of Tasmanian government-owned land that had been declared a World Heritage Area under the World Heritage Convention to which Australia is a party. Land use is otherwise a State responsibility.

More recently, the external affairs power has been used to remove the States&#x27; power to criminalise male homosexual activity. This followed an adverse report by the Human Rights Committee on Tasmanian provisions. The Human Rights Committee was established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a party. Rather than challenge the resulting Commonwealth &quot;Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act&quot; of 1994, the Tasmanian Parliament repealed the legislation in question.

Although it would appear that there is an open-ended potential for the Commonwealth to encroach on areas of traditional State competence through the external affairs power, to date it has been used with some discretion, if only because the use of the power in this way inevitably excites considerable political controversy.

===The corporations power===

The corporations power allows the Commonwealth to legislate on &quot;foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth&quot;. Although the width of the expression &quot;trading or financial corporations&quot; has never been authoritatively settled, it appears that it covers at least all commercial enterprises carried out under the corporate form.

As corporations have come to dominate the economy, the practical scope the corporations power has increased. For example, in 2005 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the &quot;WorkChoices&quot; legislation, which, relying primarily on the corporations power, seeks to create a uniform national industrial relations system to the exclusion of both the States&#x27; and the Commonwealth&#x27;s own industrial relations systems. Previous systems were based on the &#x27;conciliation and arbitration&#x27; power. The new legislation applies to all employees of a &quot;constitutional corporation.&quot; A constitutional corporation is a corporation within the meaning of section 51(xx) of the Constitution. The legislation also applies to employees of the Commonwealth and its agencies, and some others. The expected coverage of this law is approximately 85% of the Australian workforce. That proportion is likely to increase as employers who operate as sole traders or in partnerships incorporate to take advantage of the new legislation&#x27;s relatively &quot;employer-friendly&quot; provisions.

On 14 November 2006, the High Court by a 5-to-2 majority upheld the validity of the &quot;WorkChoices&quot; legislation against all the challenges that had been made to it in an action brought by each of the States and mainland Territories, as well as certain trade unions. The single majority judgment, while it did not expressly adopt, waved aside all the objections that had been argued against the &quot;object of command&quot; test for the validity of the exercise of the corporations power. Accordingly, the judgment suggests that, henceforth, it may be a sufficient basis of validity that Federal legislation be specifically addressed to constitutional corporations (&quot;A constitutional corporation must...&quot;, &quot;A constitutional corporation must not...&quot;), without any additional requirement that the legislation also address some aspect of the status or activities of corporations which is specific to such entities. If this is correct, then given the preponderant role of corporations in the modern economy, the possibility exists for substantial Federal control of the greater part of the economy, with little if any regard to the traditional constitutional &quot;heads of power&quot;.

==Protection of rights==

=== Access to the High Court ===
To a very large extent, the Constitution leaves it to Parliament to determine both the High Court&#x27;s original jurisdiction (section 76), and the exceptions to, and conditions on, its power to hear appeals (section 73). However, the Constitution grants the Court some original jurisdiction directly, without the possibility of Parliamentary limitation (section 75). This includes matters in which &quot;a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth&quot;.

In recent years, the Parliament has all but eliminated the possibility of appeal against many decisions in the area of migration, especially in regard to applications for refugee status. However, since the Parliament is not constitutionally able to limit or abolish access to the High Court for the purpose of applying for one of these &quot;constitutional writs&quot;, such applications have become a major means of challenging migration decisions. In 2014–15 94% of the applications for constitutional writs involved immigration matters.

===No Bill of Rights===
The Constitution contains no comprehensive set of human rights guarantees. Factors sometimes cited for this include faith in the common law&#x27;s protection of rights and a belief that a powerful Senate would effectively resist overzealous governments. The Constitution does contain protection for several specific rights. These include:
*right to vote in Commonwealth elections if one can vote in State ones (section 41)
* freedom of religion, and prohibition of religious tests for Federal offices (section 116)
*trial by jury in Federal cases tried on indictment (section 80)
*&quot;just terms&quot; for the compulsory &quot;acquisition&quot; of property by the Commonwealth (section 51(xxxi))
*an ambiguously worded prohibition on discrimination against residents of other States (section 117)

All but the last of these have been read down by the High Court, at least relative to the content of the corresponding United States guarantees. On the other hand, since the 1990s the High Court has been developing a jurisprudence of rights said to be &quot;implied&quot; in the text and structure of the Constitution.

In addition, a constitutional requirement that &quot;trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States ... shall be absolutely free&quot; (section 92) was, for a time, interpreted as a guarantee of some degree of freedom from economic regulation by either Commonwealth or State Parliaments. The reference to &quot;intercourse&quot;, on the other hand, has always been understood as guaranteeing a right to movement across State boundaries.

Although express protections for human and civil rights in the Constitution are scant, and have mostly been read down, some protections have been created by the High Court through its jurisprudence on the separation of powers and through its findings of rights implied by the text and structure of the constitutional document.

===Express rights===
As mentioned, there are five rights which the Constitution guarantees against the Commonwealth – religious freedom, trial by jury, &quot;just terms&quot; compensation, free trade between the states, and protection against discrimination based on the state an individual lives in. (A referendum proposal to amend the Constitution to clarify these rights and to make them good also against the States was defeated in 1988.) As will be seen, guaranteed access to the High Court can itself amount to an important right. And the guarantee of free trade and commerce was for a time interpreted as something like an individual right.

====Freedom of religion====

The Constitution states that the Commonwealth &quot;shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth&quot; (section 116).

In determining what is considered a religion, the High Court has adopted a broad approach; demonstrating an unwillingness to create a limiting definition.

The prohibition on establishing any religion has had nothing like the impact that the corresponding ban on making a law &quot;respecting an establishment of religion&quot; in the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution has had in that country. The High Court, in rejecting a challenge to Federal funding of church schools,
 seemed to take the view that nothing less than an explicit establishment of a State Church as the official religion of the Commonwealth would come within the terms of the prohibition.

Section 116 also protects the right of a person to have &quot;no&quot; religion by prohibiting the Commonwealth from &quot;imposing any religious observance&quot;.

====&quot;Just terms&quot; compensation====

The Constitution gives the Commonwealth power &quot;with respect to ... the
acquisition of property on just terms&quot; in Section 51(xxxi). By contrast, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution
contains a prohibition: &quot;nor shall private property be taken ... without just compensation&quot;. The differences between &quot;acquisition&quot; and &quot;taking&quot;, and between &quot;terms&quot; and &quot;compensation&quot;, combined with the fact that the Australian provision is expressed as a positive grant of power coupled with a limitation, have been read so as to weaken the Australian guarantee relative to the American one.

The use of the term &quot;acquisition&quot; has been interpreted so as to require that the Commonwealth (or some other party for a Commonwealth purpose) actually acquire possessory or proprietary rights over the property in question, or at least some benefit: the mere extinguishment of a person&#x27;s proprietary rights by the Commonwealth (or a prohibition on effectively exercising them) is insufficient to amount to an acquisition. And &quot;just terms&quot; has been taken to mean something less than &quot;just compensation&quot;; in particular, it does not necessarily require payment to the owner of the value of the property when it was compulsorily acquired

The Australian film &quot;The Castle&quot; addresses this issue.

====Protection against residency discrimination====
====Trial by jury for indictable offences====
The constitutional guarantee that a trial on indictment for a federal offence must be by jury (section 80) has been rendered virtually worthless because the High Court has decided that it is applicable only to a trial that proceeds &quot;formally&quot; by way of indictment, and it is completely in Parliament&#x27;s discretion to decide which offences are triable on indictment and which are not. This narrow view is confirmed in the majority judgement of &quot;Kingswell v the Queen&quot;. Powerful dissents to the effect that the section must be given some substantive meaning (the trial of offences of some specific degree of gravity must be by jury) have not prevailed.

On the other hand, where Parliament &quot;has&quot; prescribed jury trial, the Court has been willing to impose some content on that notion. In particular, it has insisted that conviction by a jury for a Federal offence must be by the unanimous agreement of the jurors – a majority verdict will not suffice.

====Freedom from economic regulation====

The constitutional requirement that &quot;trade, commerce, and intercourse amongst the States ... shall be absolutely free&quot; (section 92) was for a considerable time interpreted as a guarantee of some degree of freedom from government regulation. A notable example of this line of jurisprudence was the High Court&#x27;s disallowance of a Commonwealth Act which had the aim of nationalising the banking industry.

In 1988 following the decision in &quot;Cole v Whitfield&quot;, which was notable also for the Court&#x27;s willingness to use the transcripts of the Convention debates as an aid to interpretation, the Court unanimously decided that what the section prohibited, in relation to interstate trade and commerce, were only &quot;discriminatory burdens of a protectionist kind&quot;. That is, the section did no more than guarantee &quot;free trade&quot; (in the conventional sense) among the States. But in relation to &quot;intercourse&quot; (i.e. personal movement between States), the Court suggested that the scope of the guarantee would be much wider, and may even, in relation to some forms of such intercourse, be truly absolute.

===Implied rights===
Implied rights are the political and civil freedoms that necessarily underlie the actual words of the constitution but are not themselves expressly stated directly in the constitution. The High Court has held that no implication can be drawn from the Constitution which is not based on the actual terms of the Constitution, or on its structure. Since the 1990s the High Court has discovered rights which are said to be implied by the very structure and textual form of the Constitution. Chief amongst these is an implied right to freedom of communication on political matters. In addition, some protections of civil liberties have been the result of the High Court&#x27;s zealous attempts to safeguard the independence of, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary.

====Freedom of political communication====

Two cases decided in 1992 established a new implied right to freedom of communication on political matters. The first case, &quot;Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills&quot;, concerned a Federal provision criminalising the &quot;bringing into disrepute&quot; of members of an industrial relations tribunal, and a prosecution under that provision of a person who had published a
newspaper article repeatedly describing such members as &quot;corrupt&quot; and &quot;compliant&quot;. The second case, &quot;Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth&quot;, concerned a Federal attempt to ban political advertising on radio and television during election periods and to strictly control it at other times, via a system of &quot;free time&quot; entitlements.

In both cases, the majority of the High Court reasoned that, since the Constitution required direct election of members of the Federal Parliament, and since moreover the Ministers of State were required to be or swiftly become members of that Parliament, the result was that &quot;representative democracy is constitutionally entrenched&quot;. That being so, freedom of public discussion of political and economic matters is essential to allow the people to make their political judgments so as to exercise their right to vote effectively. Furthermore, since &quot;public affairs and political discussion are indivisible&quot;, it is impossible to limit this necessary freedom to purely Federal issues:
it applies also to issues which might be the preserve of the State or local levels of government. Therefore, there is implied in the Constitution a guarantee of freedom of communication on &quot;all&quot; political matters.

The Court stressed that this freedom is not absolute, but the result in both cases was that the relevant Federal legislation was struck down. In the latter case, some strong dissents to the effect that limiting expenditure on political advertising in the electronic media might actually &quot;enhance&quot; representative democracy did not prevail.

Both these cases concerned the validity of Federal legislation. But two years later, the Court extended the implied guarantee into the area of private law, by holding that it also applied to limit the statutory and common law of defamation. A former chairman of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Committee on Migration claimed to have been defamed by a newspaper which had published a letter accusing him of bias, in his official capacity, towards people of his own ethnic background. By trial, it was conceded that the accusation was false. However the Court accepted a &quot;constitutional defence&quot; which was said (by three Justices) to operate when otherwise defamatory statements concerning the fitness of a public official to hold office were published without knowledge of, or recklessness as to, their falsity, and when publication was reasonable in the circumstances.

This case, however, and a series of following cases, failed to produce a clear statement of the operative principle which commanded the support of a majority of the Court. But in 1997 in &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; which involved the alleged defamation of a former Prime Minister of New Zealand a unanimous Court did state the operative principle. It rejected the &quot;constitutional defence&quot; of the migration-bias case just discussed, and instead expanded the scope of &quot;qualified privilege&quot;, requiring the defendant to have &quot;actively&quot; taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the published material, and also, in most circumstances, to have given the defamed person an opportunity to respond. On the other hand, the Court made it clear that the qualified privilege may extend to discussion concerning the United Nations and other countries, even where there is no direct nexus with the exercise of political choice in Australia. In &quot;McCloy v New South Wales&quot;, the High Court further endorsed the view that a qualified freedom of political communication exists and provided an updated and more detailed legal test.

The constitutional guarantee of freedom of political communication is, prima facie, far more restricted than the generalised guarantee of
freedom of speech and of the press in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. But it remains to be seen whether a suitable expansion of the notion of &quot;political communication&quot; may not lead, in time, to a similar result. In the migration-bias case, some of the Justices, while being careful to quarantine &quot;commercial speech without political content&quot;, seemed to imply that the scope of &quot;political speech&quot; may nevertheless be very broad indeed. Mitchell Landrigan goes as far as arguing that the exception to the &quot;Anti-Discrimination Act 1977&quot; (NSW) permitting the exclusion of women from ordination as priests infringes the right of women to &quot;rise to positions from which they may take part in political speech as [politically persuasive] religious leaders.&quot; Any such constitutional protection would depend on a court finding that the anti-discrimination laws, first, effectively burdened political speech (as relevant to the Commonwealth Parliament) and, secondly, disproportionately burdened such speech.

====Right to vote====

The Constitution is silent as to many aspects of the democratic process, leaving these details to be provided by Parliament. The Constitution does however require in sections 7 and 24 that the members of Parliament be &quot;&quot;directly chosen by the people&quot;. In 1975 two judges of the High Court suggested that these requirements may amount to a right to vote, holding &quot;the long established universal adult suffrage may now be recognized as a fact and as a result it is doubtful whether ... anything less than this could be described as a choice by the people.&quot;&quot; In 1983 the High Court took a limited view of the right to vote in R v Pearson; Ex parte Sipka. The High Court Judge Michael Kirby, writing extrajudicially in 2000, said that &quot;&quot;...in Australia, there may be a basic right to vote implied in the text of the constitution itself&quot;. Prior to 2006 prisoners were only disenfranchised if they were serving sentences of three years or more. 2006 legislation sought to disenfranchise all prisoners, regardless of the length of their sentence. The validity of the disenfranchisement was challenged by Vickie Roach who was serving a four-year gaol term for negligently causing serious injury in a car accident and her legal team comprised Ron Merkel, QC and Michael Pearce, SC.

In 2007 the High Court held in Roach v Electoral Commissioner that the requirement that members be &quot;directly chosen by the people&quot;&quot; conferred a limited &quot;right to vote&quot;. In principle, these words guaranteed qualified universal franchise, and limited the Federal government&#x27;s legislative power to limit that franchise. The court held that removing right to vote for serious misconduct was acceptable and that the previous legislation was valid, however imprisonment failed as a method of identifying serious criminal misconduct such that the 2006 amendments were invalid.

The 2006 legislation was again considered in Rowe v Electoral Commissioner, where the High Court held that amendments restricting the enrolment of voters once an election has been called were also invalid. * &quot; The High Court subsequently held that closing the electoral roles 7 days after the issuing of writs was not a burden on the constitutional mandate that members of Parliament be directly chosen by the people. The right to vote does not involve a corresponding right not to vote. The High Court rejected a challenge to the 2016 Senate voting changes holding that both above the line and below the line voting were constitutionally valid methods for the people to choose their Senators.

====Right to due process====
As mentioned above, the fact that the Constitution prescribes a system of &quot;responsible&quot;, or parliamentary, government means that there can be no meaningful separation of the legislative and executive powers, despite their distinct &quot;textual&quot; separation in the Constitution. However, the same consideration does not militate against a separation of the judicial power from the other two, and in fact the High Court has come to insist on this with some force. It has also held that the separation of the judicial power implies that a body exercising that power must do so in a manner that is consistent with traditional notions of what constitutes judicial process. The result may be a limited constitutional guarantee of due process.

The judicial power of the Commonwealth is vested, in Chapter III of the Constitution, in the High Court and such other courts as the Parliament creates or invests with Federal jurisdiction. In Australian constitutional jargon, such courts are called &quot;Chapter III courts&quot;. The members of Chapter III courts may not be removed except by the Governor-General on an address from both Houses of Parliament on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity; they otherwise hold office until the age of 70.

In separate cases in 1915, and 1918, the High Court held that &quot;judicial power&quot; (essentially, the power of interpretation of the law and enforcement of decisions) could not be invested in anything other than a Chapter III court, and specifically, in anything other than a body whose members have life tenure. In &quot;Kruger v Commonwealth&quot; (1997) the High Court considered claims by members of the Stolen Generation, including that their removal and subsequent detention without due process was in contravention of the Constitution. Dawson J, and McHugh J, held that the Constitution contained no general guarantee of due process of law. Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ held that the removal of Indigenous children was not the exercise of judicial power, hence no question of due process arose.

The converse of the separation of powers is the decision of the High Court in &quot;Boilermakers&#x27; Case&quot; in 1956, that Chapter III courts cannot be invested with anything &quot;other than&quot; judicial power. To some extent the rigour of the separation of powers doctrine was softened by the Court&#x27;s subsequent acceptance that judges could, constitutionally, be assigned functions in their &quot;personal&quot; capacity as judges rather than as members of a Chapter III court. But this raised the question of which such functions were compatible with the simultaneous holding of Federal judicial office. The answers offered by the Court have been controversial and involved some very fine distinctions: for instance, it has held that a power to authorise telephone interceptions &quot;is&quot; compatible, while a power to make recommendations concerning the protection of land which might be of heritage significance to Aboriginals &quot;is not&quot; compatible. The most striking application (and extension) of this &quot;incompatibility&quot; doctrine, however, has involved the Supreme Court of the State of New South Wales, a court that may be invested with Federal jurisdiction. &quot;Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot; (1996) concerned a criminal law passed by the New South Parliament and directed at a single named individual (somewhat in the manner of a Bill of attainder).

The individual was a prisoner (under state law) whose sentence was about to expire but who was alleged to have made threats against the safety of various persons, to be carried out when released. The State Parliament enacted a law, applying only to him, which authorised the Supreme Court of New South Wales to make &quot;preventive detention orders&quot; for periods up to six months, with the possibility of renewal. The orders were to be made if the Court was satisfied, &quot;on the balance of probabilities&quot;, that the person to whom the Act applied was &quot;more likely than not to commit a serious act of violence&quot;.

It is clear that, had the &quot;Federal&quot; Parliament passed such an Act, it would be found invalid, as it was in effect a legislative judgment and so violated of the constitutional separation of the judicial power. However, the High Court found that the separation of powers was &quot;not&quot; a feature of the New South Wales constitution, so the State Act was not invalid on that ground.

The Act was found invalid, however, on the ground that since the Supreme Court of New South Wales had been invested with federal jurisdiction, it must not be required to perform a function &quot;incompatible&quot; with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. To that extent, the States are not free to legislate as they please with respect to their own courts. A requirement to order the &quot;preventive detention&quot; of someone who has not been charged with any criminal offence was found &quot;incompatible&quot; with the exercise of Federal judicial power. In this rather circuitous manner, the High Court has found a limited constitutional guarantee of due process.

<doc id="1098041" wikidata="Q1422894" url="?curid=1098041" title="Swingin' Utters">
<text>Swingin&#x27; Utters (often typeset as $wingin&#x27; Utter$, and originally called Johnny Peebucks and the Swingin&#x27; Utters) is a Californian punk rock band that formed in the late 1980s. After U.S. and European tours supporting the release of 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dead Flowers, Bottles, Bluegrass and Bones&quot;, some band members concentrated on raising their new families. From 2003-2010, the band played frequently, though mostly limited to the west coast of the United States and Canada, taking a break from any longer, comprehensive touring or recordings. During this time, they released the &quot;Live in a Dive&quot; double live album on Fat Wreck Chords (2004), and &quot;Hatest Grits&quot;, a b-sides and rarities compilation (2008). After a seven-year gap in the release of any new, original recordings, the band released the &quot;Brand New Lungs&quot; 3-song 7-inch ep in 2010, followed by the &quot;Here, Under Protest&quot; LP (2011), and have since released four more records, and have resumed touring internationally.

==History==
Johnny Peebucks and the Swingin&#x27; Utters began in Santa Cruz, California, later moving to San Francisco. The early lineup comprised singer Johnny &quot;Peebucks&quot; Bonnel, guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Darius Koski, bassist Kevin Wickersham, and drummer Greg McEntee. The band changed its name to the Swingin&#x27; Utters in 1994.

The band&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; won them &#x27;Best Debut Album&#x27; at the Bay Area Music Awards, and they were included on the first Vans Warped Tour.

They have been signed to Fat Wreck Chords since 1996, releasing &quot;A Juvenile Product of the Working Class&quot; that year and releasing seven original albums, two EP&#x27;s, a rare/b-sides compilation, a best of compilation, several 7&quot; singles, and a live record on the label since. 

While Johnny Bonnel is the lead singer of the group, lead guitarist Darius Koski provides lead vocals on many of the band&#x27;s tracks. Spike Slawson, Max Huber and Jack Dalrymple have also provided lead vocals on occasion.

The band toured the US with the Damned and Dropkick Murphys in the early 2000s. They also toured Europe with Rancid.

The band&#x27;s track &quot;The Lonely&quot; was included in the Association for Independent Music (AFIM) Indie Award-winning soundtrack of the 2001 film &quot;That Darn Punk&quot;.

In 2010 a tribute album for the band, &quot;Untitled 21: A Juvenile Tribute to the Swingin&#x27; Utters&quot;, was released. After a seven-year gap in the release of any new, original recordings, the band returned in 2010 with the &quot;Brand New Lungs&quot; EP, and followed it with the album &quot;Here, Under Protest&quot; in 2011.

The band finished their second full-length since their return, &quot;Poorly Formed&quot;, which was released in early 2013. Longtime bassist Spike Slawson left the band in 2011, and was replaced by Miles Peck. Miles left the band in May of 2017, and was replaced by Tony Teixeira.

In April 2013, the band toured Australia with Dropkick Murphys and Frank Turner. The band released the album &quot;Fistful of Hollow&quot; in 2014. It was the last album to see original/co-founding member and longtime drummer Greg McEntee, who left the band in April of 2015. He was then replaced by Luke Ray. Johnny Bonnel and Darius Koski are the only remaining original members of the band. 

Swingin&#x27; Utters toured with several other Fat Wreck alumni to support the celebration of the Fat Wreck Chords 25th Anniversary, in August 2015. The U.S. tour was followed by a show in Tokyo, Japan.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s sound is a traditional punk rock sound, and has been described as &quot;street punk&quot;. &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; described their sound as &quot;blue-collar pop-influenced punk&quot;. Comparisons have been drawn with early punk bands such as the Clash, Sham 69, the Sex Pistols, and Stiff Little Fingers. The band have also incorporated elements of country music and roots rock, with comparisons to band such as Dropkick Murphys and the Pogues. Bonnel cites early punk rock bands and Celtic music as his early influences. Darius Koski said of their music &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought of [our] songs as just loud, aggressive and fast folk or country songs.&quot;

==Side projects==
Members of the Swingin&#x27; Utters have been involved in many musical side projects, most notably Johnny Bonnel, Darius Koski, and Spike Slawson&#x27;s Filthy Thievin&#x27; Bastards (formed in 2000). Druglords of the Avenues with Johnny Peebucks singing (formed in Oakland, California in 2004), and Spike Slawson&#x27;s Me First and the Gimme Gimmes (in which he is the vocalist).

Drummer Greg McEntee also joined Viva Hate in February 2007, and the Re-Volts are fronted by Spike Slawson, with Darius Koski and Jack Dalrymple on guitar for their first record. Dalrymple was the former vocalist/guitarist for fellow Fat Wreck band Dead to Me as well. Jack also sings and plays guitar in two bands that are on Adeline Records: One Man Army, who briefly reunited after almost a decade of hiatus and released a new EP, and toyGuitar, in which Jack is joined by Miles Peck on guitar. A former Utters bandmate, Miles was also the lead singer and guitarist in Bay Area punk band the Sore Thumbs.

<text>Herath Mudiyanselage Rangana Keerthi Bandara Herath (; ; born 19 March 1978), known as Rangana Herath is a former Sri Lankan cricketer, who played all forms of cricket game and a former Test cricket captain for Sri Lanka. Considered as one of the best spinners to ever play the game, Herath is the most successful left arm bowler in Test cricket history. Herath was a member of the Sri Lankan team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20.

Herath is a specialist left-arm bowler for Sri Lanka and holds the record of best bowling figures in Test matches by a left-arm spinner with 433 wickets. On 11 March 2017, Herath surpassed 362 wickets by Daniel Vettori to become the most successful left-arm spinner in Test cricket history. He is the first left-arm spinner to take 400 Test wickets. On 10 February 2018 during Bangladesh tour, Herath became the most successful left-arm bowler in Test cricket history by surpassing Wasim Akram. He has the longest Test cricket career for Sri Lanka with a span of 19 years from 1999 to 2018.

On 29 May 2016, Herath became the third Sri Lankan bowler to take 300 wickets in Test cricket history after Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas. On 8 November 2016, Herath became only the third bowler in history to take five-wicket hauls against all Test-playing nations. On 2 October 2017, he became the second Sri Lankan bowler to take 400 test wickets. He is the oldest player to reach 350 as well as 400 Test wickets.

On 23 October 2016, Herath was announced as captain for Sri Lanka tour to Zimbabwe. Angelo Mathews, the regular captain, was injured. With this he became the oldest Sri Lankan player to lead a Test team for the first time and from any country since Tom Graveney in 1968.

On 22 October 2018, Herath announced his retirement from international cricket after the first Test at Galle against England. On 6 November 2018, he played in his final Test in Galle. In the first innings of the match, he became the third bowler to take 100 Test wickets at the same venue, when he dismissed the England captain Joe Root. After the match, Herath said that it was &quot;the right time&quot; to retire, finishing his career with 433 Test wickets, the most for a left-arm spin bowler. 

He worked as spin bowling consultant with the Bangladesh cricket team.

==Personal life and early and domestic career==
Herath was born on 19 March 1978, in the small village of Waduwawa, Kurunegala, on the southeastern tip of the Northwestern Province as the second of the family. His elder brother is Deepthi Herath. He was promoted to opening batting in school times, and acted as a pacer, until his coach told him to start spin bowling due to height problem. Before starting professional career, Herath was working at Sampath Bank as a clerk, when he met brother of Chandika Hathurusingha.

Herath started his cricket career at his first school Mayurapada Central College, Narammala. Later, he moved to Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala. Having made his first-class debut for Kurunegala Youth Cricket Club in 1996–97 cricket season, Rangana Herath currently represents Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in Sri Lankan first-class cricket. He represented Moors Sports Club from 1998/99 to 2009/10 in local first-class cricket. He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Moors Sports Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament. He also played for Surrey during the latter part of the 2009 English cricket season. In April 2010, Herath joined Hampshire, where he played in the first half of the 2010 County Championship.

In March 2018, Herath was named in Dambulla&#x27;s squad for the 2017–18 Super Four Provincial Tournament.

==International career==
===Early career===
Herath made his Test debut at Galle International Stadium, Sri Lanka against Australia in 1999. His One Day International debut came five years later in 2004, against Zimbabwe at Harare Sports Club. During the 2016 England series, Herath was ranked as 13th Test match bowler in the world, having hit the heights of second in the list in 2012.

Although Herath made his Test debut back in 1999, he never came to the prominence as a leading spinner until the retirement of Muralitharan. Herath made a successful comeback to Test cricket in 2009 against Pakistan and took over the mantle of Sri Lanka&#x27;s main spin bowler from Muralitharan. Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene rated Herath as Sri Lanka&#x27;s number one bowler after the retirement of Muralitharan.

===Establishment in squad===
After playing second role in the team for long time behind the shadow of maestro Muttiah Muralitharan, Herath ascended to prominence against Australia in 1999 with a &quot;mystery&quot; ball. He broke into the national side after an impressive A tour to England. Herath while playing in two test matches in the series, deceived the visiting Australians with a delivery that darted the other way. He took six test wickets against the Australians. Herath made a comeback to the Test side, taking 15 wickets in the 3 match Test series vs. Pakistan played in Sri Lanka, also winning the man-of-the-match award in the first Test. Herath then took 8 wickets in the second Test in the two match Test-series between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka. This led Sri Lanka to a win, and a series victory.

Herath played only in the test at Galle during the home series against India. Though Sri Lanka won, he only managed to take the wicket of Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh in that match. Herath was recalled for the second test match against the West Indies in November 2010. In that match played at the newly renovated R. Premadasa Stadium, he took three wickets in the first innings. In the second Test of Sri Lanka&#x27;s tour of South Africa in December 2011, Herath took nine wickets and won the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; award. Sri Lanka won the match by 208 runs; it was their first Test win in South Africa.

Herath took 12 wickets during the first test match of the 2012 England test series. His match winning performance helped him to secure the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; award in Galle. Herath was England&#x27;s latest spin tormentor with 6 for 74 during the first inning and he took another 6 wickets for just 97 runs and confirmed the Sri Lanka&#x27;s victory against the touring English team.

===Memorable 2014 World Twenty20===
Herath memorably took figures of 5–3 against New Zealand in the 2014 World T20, a spell that helped Sri Lanka qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament. Sri Lanka eventually won the tournament and Herath&#x27;s spell was named the Wisden Men&#x27;s T20I spell of the decade in 2019.

===Breaking records===
In the first innings of the second Test against Pakistan, Herath took nine wickets for 127 runs, the best figures for a left-arm bowler in Test cricket. He was man of the match in both Test matches and also man of the series.

During the Sri Lankan cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2013–14, Herath became the first Sri Lankan and 16th overall to be dismissed for a king pair in test history.

For his performances in 2014, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

In the second innings of the first Test against India in 2015, Herath took seven wickets for 48 runs, where Sri Lanka only had 175 runs behind India&#x27;s total of 375. Herath was only able to take a single wicket in the first innings and had a fairly poor performance in the first innings. But his strong comeback in the second innings with other new spinner Tharindu Kaushal, India were all out for 112 runs, where Herath took 7 for 48 and Kaushal with 3 for 47. This was his 22nd five-wicket haul in Tests.

In the first match at Galle against West Indies in 2015, Sri Lanka posted a huge total of 484 with the help of two centuries. In the bowling, Herath took his 23rd five-wicket haul in test cricket and the very first against West Indies. He finished with 6/68 runs and West Indies were all out for 251. This gave windies to keep follow-on and they came in to bat for the second innings just on the third day. Just as in the first innings, Herath was all over the Windies, where they all out for 227 runs, giving Sri Lanka a huge win by an innings and 6 runs. Herath took 4/79 in second innings, finished his fifth ten-wicket haul in Test cricket and adjudged man of the match award as well. The second match was a show of bowlers. Both teams do not score more than 250 in each innings, and Herath only took a single wicket in the first innings. West Indies required 245 runs to win the match, but Herath strikes again, picked up 4 wickets and sealed the game for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka won the series 2-0 and Herath was the Player of the Series.

In England tour 2016, Herath took two wickets in the first test at Leeds, with 299 test wickets. However, Sri Lanka lost the match by an innings and 88 runs. In the second match at Chester-Le-Street, Herath took his 300th test wicket by dismissing Steven Finn, caught by himself. He became the third Sri Lankan after Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas to reach 300 test wickets in history. He also played well with the bat scoring 61 whilst batting with Dinesh Chandimal before being out to James Anderson.

On 11 February 2018, against Sri Lanka, Herath overtook the legendary Wasim Akram&#x27;s wicket tally in Test cricket to become the highest wicket-taking left-arm bowler.

===Limited overs retirement===
Herath revealed his intentions to retire from ODIs and T20Is after 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Sri Lanka exited from the World T20 in the first round and Herath announced his retirement on 17 April 2016. This was largely due to the fact that, Herath was picked to the recent limited over tournaments game after a game and with the few years to come with his age, he wants to focus more towards Test cricket. Until retirement, Herath played 71 ODIs, took 74 wickets with the average of 31.91. He played 17 T20Is, where took 18 wickets with the best bowling figures of 5 for 3 against New Zealand in 2014 World T20I.

===Dominating test arena===
Herath showed his talents in home soil back against Australian in the Warne Murali Series in 2016. In the first test, he took 4 four wickets in first innings and match-winning five-wicket haul in the second innings. Sri Lanka eventually won the match by 106 runs, which is only the second win against Australia in 27 test matches by Sri Lanka. Herath has taken 7 fifers in the fourth innings of Tests by 29 innings, which is the most fifers in second innings in least innings, previously held by Muttiah Muralitharan, who took 35 innings to reach the milestone. Bowling figures of 5 for 58 in the match is also the best bowling figures in a Test innings in Pallekele.

During the second Test at Galle, Herath took a hat-trick by dismissing Adam Voges, Peter Nevill, and Mitchell Starc in the Australian first innings. He became the second Sri Lankan after Nuwan Zoysa, and first Sri Lankan spinner to take a Test hat-trick. He is also the second left-arm orthodox bowler ever to take a Test hat trick after Johnny Briggs in 1892. In the process he became the oldest cricketer to take a hat-trick in Test matches.

In the third Test at SSC, Herath took his 25th and 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. This is his fourth consecutive Test against Australia in where he has taken four or more wickets in the opponent&#x27;s first innings. His 25th fifer mark is the highest by a bowler to take fifers since 2009. In this period, no other bowler has taken even 20 such hauls. His ten wicket haul in the match gave the series whitewash against Number 1 ranked Australia for the first time in history. He took 13 wickets in the last test match and 28 wickets in the series. Both these wicket figures are record for a Sri Lankan against Australia.

=== Captaincy ===
After usual captain Angelo Mathews injured during ODI series against Australia, vice captain Dinesh Chandimal was also injured during T20I series of the same tour. With these major players absent, Herath was appointed as the captain of Test team for the Zimbabwe tour. On 29 September 2016, he led the team in a test match, becoming the oldest player to lead a Test team for the first time since Somachandra de Silva in 1983. The match was won by Sri Lanka, where Herath led from the front, took 6 wickets in the match.

On 8 November 2016, Herath took his 27th five wicket haul, becoming the third overall to take five-wicket hauls against all Test-playing nations, after Muttiah Muralitharan and Dale Steyn. He took 13 wickets in the second test match, recording best bowling figures against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. He dismissed Carl Mumba by taking 350th wicket, recorded as the oldest player to achieve the feat. Only Muralitharan has taken more 12-wicket hauls than Herath, who has five to Murali&#x27;s six. Sri Lanka whitewashed Zimbabwe 2-0 and Herath adjudged man of the match for his impressive performance. For his performances in 2016, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC and Cricinfo.



Herath was appointed as the Test captain for the March 2017 Bangladesh tour in home soil, after Angelo Mathews was not able to recover from the injuries. In the fourth innings of first Test in Galle, Herath surpassed 362 test wickets by Daniel Vettori to become the most successful left-arm spinner in Test cricket history. He took six wickets at the end to give Sri Lanka a 257 runs win. With three consecutive wins, Herath became the first Sri Lanka captain to achieve this feat. He was only the second left arm spinner to grab 350+ test wickets after Daniel Vettori in test history. In the second match, Herath reached another milestone, by dismissing Mustafizur Rahman, to record 1,000 first-class wickets. He is the second player from Sri Lanka and the 12th from the subcontinent to achieve the feat. Despite his milestones, Sri Lanka lost the match by four wickets, which is their first defeat against Bangladesh. The Test series was drawn 1–1.

Herath was appointed as the stand-in captain for the first test against India in August 2017 as the captain Dinesh Chandimal was diagnosed with pneumonia. Herath took only one wicket and conceded 159 runs in the first innings of the visitors. During the second innings where Sri Lanka had to chase 550 runs, Herath did not bat, due to an injury suffered while fielding. With Asela Gunaratne too ruled out of the rest of the series due to a &quot;pretty serious&quot; fractured thumb which he suffered on the opening day of the match, Sri Lanka had to play with nine players. Sri Lanka lost the Test by 304 runs, which as of February 2018 is Sri Lanka&#x27;s biggest loss in term of runs in Tests.

===Late career===
During the second Test against South Africa in late 2016 at Newlands, Herath surpassed 355 test wickets of Chaminda Vaas by dismissing Kyle Abbott for LBW, becoming the second highest wicket-taker for Sri Lanka. During the first match, Herath ended the year 2016 as the second highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 57 scalps, only behind Indian Ravichandran Ashwin (72 scalps). He took 5 five-wicket hauls and 2 ten-wicket hauls in the year with economy of 2.61. Despite his achievements, Sri Lanka lost all three Tests.

Herath took 1/159 in the first innings of the first Test against India in Galle. He went wicketless in the second. In the second Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo he took 4/154 as India won the match by an innings and 53 runs. He had complained of a stiff back during the SSC Test having bowled 42 overs. Herath had also sent down 71.1 overs in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe before the series with India and had bowled 49 overs at Galle. He was rested from the final Test in Pallekele. India went on to win the series 3–0.

The first Test against Pakistan on 28 September 2017, was one of the career highlights for Herath. In the match he took his ninth ten-wicket haul which included his 32nd and 33rd five-wicket hauls guided Sri Lanka to a 21-run victory. During the match, Herath took his 100th test wicket against Pakistan by dismissing Mohammad Amir, becoming the first bowler to achieve the feat against Pakistan in Tests. Amir&#x27;s wicket was his 399th scalp in tests, until he dismissed Mohammad Abbas as his 400th Test wicket. With that wicket, Herath joined elite club of 400 test wickets, becoming the first left-arm spinner, 14th overall and second Sri Lankan to achieve the milestone. Herath adjudged man of the match award as well for his impressive match-winning bowling performances.

In the first Test against India Herath went wicketless on a seamer-friendly pitch in Kolkata. However, he made 67 to hand Sri Lanka a lead of 122 runs in the first innings. The rain-affected match ended in draw. In the second Test in Nagpur which Sri Lanka lost by an innings and 239 runs, Herath took 1/81 having bowled 39 overs. He had complained about back pain at the end of the Test and as a result was ruled out of the third Test in New Delhi. India won the series 1–0 after the 3rd Test was drawn.

In the first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong, Herath took 3/150 in the first innings and 2/80 in the second. During the second Test in Mirpur, Herath surpassed Wasim Akram&#x27;s tally of 414 wickets to become the most successful left-arm bowler in the history of Test cricket and moved to the 12th place in the list of leading wicket takers in Test cricket history with 415 scalps. Sri Lanka now has the unique record of having the greatest ever right arm bowler, Muttiah Muralitharan and Rangana Herath, the greatest ever left arm bowler in Test cricket. Although Herath gave away 31 runs in 12 overs and went wicketless in the first innings, he took 4/49 in the second and helped Sri Lanka cruise to a three-day win over Bangladesh to win the series 1–0. Herath also equalled the Sri Lankan record of Muttiah Muralitharan for taking the most wickets in the fourth innings of test matches (106) and just second only to Shane Warne who has achieved 138 wickets.

In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018–19 season. However, he only played one Test in Caribbean during the 3-Test match series against West Indies, where he missed the day-night test due to a split webbing in his hand, sustained during fielding drills.

In July 2018, during an interview with BBC Sinhala, he hinted that the England tour of Sri Lanka will be his final international appearance.

During the second test against South Africa, he took his 34th test fifer in South Africa&#x27;s second innings. With that, Sri Lanka won the match by 199 runs and sealed the series 2–0. This was his 12th fifer in a fourth innings of a match, more than any other bowler in the history.

===Retirement===
In July 2018, Herath hinted that he thinks to retire from international cricket in November, after the England series. On 22 October, he announced that he retire from Test cricket after the first Test against England at Galle. He is the last Test cricketer to retire after making his debut in the 20th century.

He played his last Test match at his favorite venue Galle International Stadium on 6 November 2018. He scored 14 runs in the first innings and 5 runs in the second innings, until he run out as the last victim in Sri Lanka innings. Even Sri Lanka lost the match by 221 runs, Herath took the wicket of Joe Root as his 100th wicket in Galle International Stadium. With that, he became only the second Sri Lankan, third bowler and first left arm bowler to take 100 Test wickets at a single venue. In the second innings, Herath took two wickets and finished his 19 years of career. As said by skipper Chandimal, the match was dedicated to Herath.

The ground was covered by many tributes to Herath highlighting that &quot;Good Bye Legend Herath&quot;, and &quot;Thank You Herath&quot;. Until his retirement from Tests, Herath is the 8th highest wicket taker of all time.

In November 2020, Herath was nominated for the ICC Men&#x27;s Test Cricketer of the Decade award.

===International five-wicket hauls===

His best bowling figures are 9/127 against Pakistan in 2014, 18th time in Test cricket a bowler took 9 or more wickets in an innings. His best T20I figures of 5/3 are the third best ever in T20 Internationals.

As of May 2022, Herath&#x27;s 34 five-wicket hauls in Tests and one in a T20Is, ranks him seventh among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, and second in the equivalent list for Sri Lanka, behind Muttiah Muralitharan.

<text>The Korea Cup (), formerly the Korean FA Cup, is a national football cup knockout competition of South Korea, held annually by the Korea Football Association (KFA). Before the competition was established in 1996, two similar tournaments named All Joseon Football Tournament (1921–1940) and Korean National Football Championship (1946–2000) were played. It was renamed Korea Cup in 2024, with the winners qualifying for the AFC Champions League Elite (if they finish top four in the K League 1) or the AFC Champions League Two (if they finish outside the top four in the K League 1).

==History==

The All Joseon Football Tournament was founded by the Joseon Sports Council in 1921, during Japanese rule in Korea. Youth, student and adult football clubs from various provinces participated. After 1934, it became a part of the Korean National Sports Festival, which was the championship for various sports games and matched Koreans against other sports championships operated by Japanese who lived in Korea. The Joseon Sports Council was disbanded in 1937, due to the Japanese government&#x27;s oppression, and the Joseon Football Association (currently KFA) succeeded it after 1938, but was cancelled after 1940 for the same reason during World War II.

After the liberation of Korea, the KFA founded the National Football Championship and the President&#x27;s Cup, entered by many semi-professional clubs and amateur clubs from all over South Korea. They opened in spring and late autumn each.

The National Football Championship declined after the founding of the K League, because professional clubs and famous players didn&#x27;t take part in it. There were several efforts to make professional clubs join the tournament, and it became so successful that many top-rank clubs joined the championship, renamed &quot;FA Cup&quot;, during 1988 and 1989 season. However, it soon returned to a semi-professional tournament in 1990, because of discord between the KFA and professional clubs. The current FA Cup separated from the National Championship in 1996, and two competitions merged again since 2001. The President&#x27;s Cup was also abolished in 2010.

==Format==
===1996–2005===
The Korean FA Cup took place after the end of the regular K League season, and was usually completed over a short period. Games were played in a single-elimination format, with extra time and penalties if required. K League sides were seeded in the 1st round of the tournament proper, but all matches were played at neutral venues, such as Gimcheon and Namhae.

===2006–present===
To elevate the status of the tournament, matches were spread throughout the year. The 2006 edition, for example, started in early March, with rounds also held in April, July, August and November. The final was played in December. As in previous years, the competition was contested in a straight knockout format.

<text>John Hart Ely ( ; December 3, 1938 – October 25, 2003) was an American legal scholar. He was a professor of law at Yale Law School from 1968 to 1973, Harvard Law School from 1973 to 1982, Stanford Law School from 1982 to 1996, and at the University of Miami Law School from 1996 until his death. From 1982 until 1987, he was the 9th dean of Stanford Law School.

As a student at Yale Law School, Ely became a member of the legal team of Abe Fortas, contributing to the landmark ruling in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; that required states to provide legal representation to those who could not afford their own. He continued his legal career as the youngest staff member of the Warren Commission tasked with investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After clerking for Justice Earl Warren, he went on to study abroad and returned to take a position as a public defender before beginning a distinguished career in academia as a professor at Yale, Harvard, and Stanford.

During his scholarly career, Ely became known for his devotion to the separation of powers and championship of the political process theory. An outspoken critic of judicial activism, he penned an article in the pages of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; criticizing the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in spite of his own agreements with the ruling on policy grounds. His 1980 work &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot; became the most-cited legal text written in the 20th century.

In 1996, Ely had three publications which were among the most-cited law review articles of all time. According to a 2000 study in the University of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Legal Studies,&quot; he was ranked fourth among the most widely cited legal scholars in American history after Richard Posner, Ronald Dworkin, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

==Early life and education==
Ely was born and raised in New York City. His father was John H. Ely Sr. and his mother was Elliott Payne. After graduating from Westhampton Beach High School in 1956, he enrolled at Princeton University, majoring in philosophy and earning a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, with Phi Beta Kappa membership in 1960. He then attended Yale Law School, where he was the notes and comments editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, graduating in 1963 with an LL.B., &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and membership in the Order of the Coif.

While still a third-year student at Yale, Ely became a summer clerk at Arnold, Fortas, &amp; Porter—a Washington, D.C. law firm. There, he assisted Abe Fortas in the landmark case of &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, writing a first draft of a brief on behalf of the plaintiff, Clarence Earl Gideon. Ely had been tasked with doing the basic research for the case, writing under pressure to produce a set of legal memoranda including a 25-page paper titled &quot;Application, Ambiguities, and Weaknesses of the Special Counsel Rule&quot; that examined the application of &quot;Betts v. Brady&quot; in state courts.

After law school, Ely served as the youngest staff member of the Warren Commission, aiding its investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. From 1964 to 1965, Ely clerked for Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court. As a law clerk, Ely drafted the majority opinion in the landmark decision &quot;Hanna v. Plumer&quot;; he considered Warren his hero, later dedicating his landmark book, &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot;, to him. Ely studied at the London School of Economics as a Fulbright scholar following his clerkship. Upon returning to the United States, he spent some time as part of the Military Police Corps and, despite being overqualified for the job, took a modest position as a public defender in San Diego.

== Academic career ==

In 1968, Ely joined the faculty of Yale Law School. For five years, he served as a professor at Yale before moving to teach at Harvard Law School in 1973—holding the school&#x27;s first chair in constitutional law. During this period, he wrote several influential law review articles, including his highly critical analysis of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in an article entitled &quot;The Wages of Crying Wolf,&quot; published in the &quot;Yale Law Journal.&quot; For a brief period, he took a year&#x27;s leave to serve as general counsel to the U.S. Department of Transportation and spent a year at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1982, Ely left his place at Harvard in order to serve as the dean of Stanford Law School, remaining with the faculty until 1996. At Stanford, his tenure as dean was marked by a program to implement a loan forgiveness program for public interest lawyers and to revitalize the law school&#x27;s curriculum—something he described as &quot;a boring wasteland&quot;. A liberal Democrat, he also worked to advance the university&#x27;s social justice and diversity. At the end of his deanship in 1987, Ely continued teaching at Stanford as the university&#x27;s Robert E. Paradise Professor of Law and developed an interest in subjects concerning congressional war powers.

Prompted by his love of scuba diving, Ely visited the University of Miami School of Law in 1996. Upon discovering he liked the city and the faculty, he chose to stay and became the university&#x27;s Richard A. Hausler Professor of Law—the law school&#x27;s most distinguished chair.

== Scholarship ==

=== &quot;The Wages of Crying Wolf&quot; ===
In 1973, Ely&#x27;s article entitled &quot;The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade&quot; was published in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. The article was a vociferous criticism of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; which had given a constitutional basis for a right to abortion. Despite his own personal views in support of the availability of abortions, Ely was critical of the Court&#x27;s decision to utilize the doctrine of substantive due process, arguing that since the Court&#x27;s ruling was untethered from the constitution&#x27;s text, it had &quot;no business imposing it.&quot; He further contended that justices of the Supreme Court had an obligation to establish constitutional rights &quot;in some identifiable constitutional value&quot; before barring states from imposing their own regulations on abortion:What is frightening about &quot;Roe&quot; is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers&#x27; thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation&#x27;s governmental structure. Nor is it explainable in terms of the unusual political impotence of the group judicially protected vis-à-vis the interest that legislatively prevailed over it.

Ely agreed that a right of privacy can be inferred from various provisions in the Constitution and that the right was grounded in its history, text, and theory. However, he saw no reason why it would have included a right to abortion, why that right would be fundamental, and why the countervailing interests of protecting the fetus did not count as part of a disenfranchised minority. Towards the end of his article, he wrote:It is, nevertheless, a very bad decision. Not because it will perceptibly weaken the Court—it won&#x27;t; and not because it conflicts with either my idea of progress or what the evidence suggests is society&#x27;s—it doesn&#x27;t. It is bad because it is bad constitutional law, or rather because it is &quot;not&quot; constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.&quot;The Wages of Crying Wolf&quot; projected a profound influence over legal opinions concerning &quot;Roe&quot;, with the article eventually becoming the third most-cited work in the history of &quot;The Yale Law Journal&quot; according to a 1991 study by Fred R. Shapiro. A similar ranking by Shapiro in 2012 placed it as the 20th most-cited law review article of all time. In a 2022 piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Emily Bazelon described it as having &quot;eviscerated Blackmun&#x27;s opinion,&quot; with Linda Greenhouse stating that Ely &quot;sent &quot;Roe&quot; into the world disabled...It really was very damaging. Not because the American public cared about doctrine—they cared about results—but because it left &quot;Roe&quot; without friends in high places.&quot; When the Supreme Court overruled &quot;Roe&quot; in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, Justice Samuel Alito cited &quot;Wages&quot; as an example of the academic criticism it faced.

=== &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot; ===
While a professor at Harvard, Ely produced his most notable work: the book &quot;Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review&quot;, published in 1980. It would become one of the most influential works about American constitutional law and among the most praised for deconstructing—and defending—the doctrine of judicial review on procedural grounds. &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot; rejected theories which had no basis in the constitutional &quot;text, history, or structure&quot;, using political theory as opposed to originalism to serve as argumentative foundations.

The book may be viewed as two separate books: one criticizing constitutionally ungrounded legal theories and the other providing a theory for judicial interventions. Ely expounds a theory of constitutional interpretation known as political process theory, suggesting that judges ought to focus on maintaining a well-functioning democratic process and guard against systematic biases in the legislative process.

Ely asserts that the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government by ensuring equal representation in the political process (as in the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;). He argues that the Constitution&#x27;s unenumerated rights (such as the Ninth Amendment and the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) are procedural rather than substantive in nature and thus protect rights to democratic processes but are not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone&#x27;s Footnote Four from &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot; (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely&#x27;s theory of judicial review.

The initial release of &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot; was controversial; it received a large amount of criticism from academics, including a dismissive piece from Laurence Tribe published in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. However, a 1991 appraisal of the work by Michael J. Klarman concludes that &quot;political process theory emerges relatively unscathed from attacks leveled by Ely&#x27;s critics against its more global aspects.&quot; In a &quot;New York Times&quot; piece after Ely&#x27;s death, Mark Tushnet called it &quot;the most important work of constitutional scholarship in the two generations from the time it was published to now.&quot;

===&quot;War and Responsibility&quot;===
In 1993, Ely published his second book titled &quot;War and Responsibility: Constitutional Lessons of Vietnam and Its Aftermath&quot;, which criticized the Vietnam War and re-assessed the discussion of the War Powers Act. The book is presented in six chapters and the initial chapters put into question the constitutionality of the Vietnam War. Chapters four and five bring into question belligerent acts conducted by the United States against the states of Laos and Cambodia. Chapter six discusses the future of covert warfare as part of the government&#x27;s diligence or lack of diligence in conducting its foreign affairs. The closing Appendix discusses the paramenters of the War Powers Act.

==Personal life and death==
In 1971, Ely married Nancy Halliday Ely-Raphel, who would later become the United States Ambassador to Slovenia. They had two sons: John and Robert. However, the two divorced and Ely married Gisela Cardonne Ely, a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge.

On October 25, 2003, Ely died in his Miami home at Coconut Grove after a long battle with cancer. His funeral was held at Coral Gables Congregational Church and was attended by Dennis O. Lynch, then the dean of the University of Miami School of Law.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1981, Ely was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The next year, he received the 1982 Triennial Award of the Order of the Coif for &quot;Democracy and Distrust&quot;. As the primary subject of the &quot;Virginia Law Review&quot;, the journal dedicated its May 1991 issue to examining Ely&#x27;s book in the decade since it had been published.

Ely was the recipient of multiple honorary degrees including those from the University of San Diego and the Chicago-Kent College of Law. In 2003, Ely was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale Law School; the award&#x27;s citation read: &quot;Your work set the standard for constitutional scholarship for our generation.&quot; Following his death in October of that same year, the school held a November symposium in his honor titled &quot;On Democratic Ground: New Perspectives on John Hart Ely.&quot;

In her 2011 book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine Baume identified Ely as a significant defender of the &quot;compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy&quot;. Ely was listed alongside Ronald Dworkin as one of the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years.

<text>The President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition (PCSFN) is an American government organization that aims to promote &quot;programs and initiatives that motivate people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities to lead active, healthy lives.&quot; It is part of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Prior to June 2010, it was called the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.

The council&#x27;s work is informed by a Science Board, composed primarily of academic researchers and scholars. The first Science Board was appointed during the George W. Bush administration in 2003 with Charles B. &quot;Chuck&quot; Corbin, Ph.D., Arizona State University, serving as its inaugural chair. In 2016, Corbin received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the PCSFN.

The Science Board was active for several years, but eventually went dormant. It was reinstated on June 21, 2019, with strong urging from organizations such as the National Academy of Kinesiology.

A newly formed Science Board was announced on January 22, 2020, with Bradley J. Cardinal, Ph.D., Oregon State University, appointed as chair. During their 2-year term, the Science Board established the scientific basis of the National Youth Sports Strategy, including a wide variety of evidence-based documents and reports.

==History==
During the 1940s, the American Medical Association and the National Committee on Physical Fitness had a joint committee encouraging physical fitness.

The President&#x27;s Council on Youth Fitness was founded on July 16, 1956, to encourage American children.

In 1963, President Kennedy changed the council&#x27;s name to President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness to reflect its role to serve all Americans.

In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Presidential Physical Fitness Award, the name of which was later changed to President&#x27;s Challenge Youth Physical Fitness Awards Program. In 1968, the council&#x27;s name was changed to President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports to emphasize the importance of sports in life.

In 1972, the Presidential Sports Award Program was created.

In 1983, the United States Congress declared May as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.

In 1996, the Surgeon General&#x27;s Report on Physical Activity and Health was released. In 1997, the Council released its report on Physical Activity and Sport in the Lives of Boys.

In June 2010, President Barack Obama renamed the agency the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, with a new emphasis on nutrition as an element of fitness. First Lady Michelle Obama announced the new commission&#x27;s goal &quot;to end the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation&quot; and also announced that the president had named, as the new co-chairs of the council, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and former Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes.

On January 11, 2012, operators of the website for participants of the Challenge and Active Lifestyle programs learned that the site had been hacked, resulting in the release of personal information of the participants. The President&#x27;s Challenge site displayed a notice that it was down for &quot;Site Maintenance – We&#x27;re taking a little breather.&quot; On January 20, 2012, the site was modified to explain the hacking. On January 27, 2012, The President&#x27;s Challenge sent out emails to its participants saying that the website was functional as of January 24, 2012, and asked participants to reset their user passwords.

==Awards==
The council publishes guidelines for awards that are given out. They are the Presidential Physical Fitness Award, the National Physical Fitness Award, and the Participant Physical Fitness Award. However, it has been announced that the Physical Fitness Test on which these awards are based will no longer be available after the 2012–2013 school year.

There is also a Community Leadership Award that is given out annually to 50 people or organizations for encouraging physical activity, fitness, and nutrition.

===Standardized tests===
The award was given to students who achieved the top fifteenth percentile cumulative scores across these events and were based on age/gender and were taken by all participants. Pull ups/flexed-arm hang was based on gender and was the only event where one was done by boys and the other by girls:

<text>The President&#x27;s Challenge (also called Presidential Champions) was an American program promulgated by the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition that aimed to encourage all Americans to &quot;make being active part of their everyday lives&quot; and to be physically fit. The President&#x27;s Challenge was introduced by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966. It was designed to help motivate participants (international participants also eligible) to improve regardless of activity and fitness level. The Presidential Champions program was discontinued on June 30, 2018.

==Program content==
The President&#x27;s Challenge program included Awards for actively performing members in their preferred games, sports, or athletics. There were various levels of Awards available. They are:

* Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA)
* Health Fitness Award
* Presidential Champions Awards
** Presidential Champions Bronze Award
** Presidential Champions Silver Award
** Presidential Champions Gold Award
** Presidential Champions Platinum Award

To obtain credit participants had to log in their daily efforts, which could include both sports and physical fitness activities. Each daily activity gave a certain number of points, the number computed by both its intensity and duration. Reporting was entirely on the honor system. Each higher level award required accumulating more points. There was no time limit. Qualifiers were eligible for certificates, medals and patches, with the platinum award being a large medallion.

Participants who achieved the Platinum Award were also offered participation in the Presidential Champions Platinum Award program. The Platinum Awards page was taken down in 2016 following the transition of the program from being under the administration of FDA to the Department on Agriculture on August 31, 2016. SuperTracker and the new management did not track Platinum earners or post any information about them, and the program was suspended in 2018.

==Website hacked==
On January 11, 2012, the operators of the website for participants of the Challenge and Active Lifestyle programs learned that the website had been hacked resulting in the release of personal information of the participants.

On January 27, 2012, The President&#x27;s Challenge sent out emails to its participants saying that the website was functional as of January 24, 2012, and asked participants to reset their user passwords.

==Discontinuation==
The Trump administration terminated the program on June 30, 2018. The reason stated was that the private sector created many other tools that have the same purpose, so it was discontinued to invest in newer ways to help Americans have a healthy lifestyle.

<doc id="1098071" wikidata="Q6142271" url="?curid=1098071" title="USS Rasher">
<text>USS &quot;Rasher&quot; (SS/SSR/AGSS/IXSS-269), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the rasher, or vermilion rockfish, a fish found along the California coast.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Rasher&quot;, a fleet submarine, was laid down on 4 May 1942 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched 20 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. G. C. Weaver; and commissioned 8 June 1943, Commander E. S. Hutchinson in command. Admiral Charles A. Lockwood had earlier relieved Hutchinson of command of the submarine for lacking aggressiveness.

==Service history==
Following builder&#x27;s trials in Lake Michigan, &quot;Rasher&quot; was decommissioned and towed down the Mississippi on a floating drydock. After recommissioning and fitting out in New Orleans, the new submarine trained in the Bay of Panama, departed Balboa 8 August 1943, and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 11 September.

=== First war patrol, September – November 1943 ===
On her first war patrol, 24 September through 24 November 1943, &quot;Rasher&quot; operated in the Makassar Strait–Celebes Sea area, and sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kogane Maru&quot; in a submerged attack at dawn on 9 October. Four days later, off Ambon Harbor, she spotted a convoy of four merchantmen escorted by two destroyers and a &quot;Pete&quot; seaplane. She fired two salvoes of three torpedoes each, then crash dived to avoid the destroyers and bombs from the scout plane. Freighter &quot;Kenkoku Maru&quot; broke up and sank, while the escorts struck back in a vigorous but vain counterattack.

On the afternoon of 31 October, while patrolling the shipping lanes off the Borneo coast, &quot;Rasher&quot; commenced trailing tanker &quot;Koryo Maru&quot;, but because of a patrolling float plane, was unable to attack until night. &quot;Rasher&quot; then surfaced, attacked and sent the tanker to the bottom after a thunderous explosion of exploding torpedoes and gasoline.

The submarine&#x27;s next victim was tanker &quot;Tango Maru&quot; which lost her stern to a spread of three torpedoes on the afternoon of 8 November. &quot;Rasher&quot; escaped the escorts by diving deep and silently slipping away. A midnight attack on a second convoy in the Makassar Strait off Mangkalihat Peninsula resulted in a hit on a tanker, but vigorous countermeasures by enemy destroyers prevented any assessment of damage. &quot;Rasher&quot; escaped the enemy surface craft and, her torpedoes expended, headed home. During her transit, an Allied patrol bomber mistakenly attacked her in the Indian Ocean north-northeast of Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia at on 20 November 1943, dropping a depth charge as &quot;Rasher&quot; was submerging and passing a depth of . &quot;Rasher&quot; sustained no damage, and arrived at Fremantle on 24 November 1943.

Hutchinson had cleared his record on &quot;Grampus&quot; with the sinkings and was promoted to command a submarine division.

=== Second war patrol, December 1943 – January 1944 ===
Command of &quot;Rasher&quot; was given to Willard Ross Laughon, former commanding officer of in the Atlantic Ocean. Following refit, &quot;Rasher&quot; commenced her second war patrol on 19 December 1943 and hunted Japanese shipping in the South China Sea off Borneo. When she attacked a three-tanker convoy on the night of 4 January 1944, her first torpedo exploded prematurely. A melee ensued, with tankers scattering and escorts racing about, firing in all directions. &quot;Rasher&quot; was pursuing &quot;Hakko Maru&quot; when the tanker exploded from a torpedo from . &quot;Rasher&quot; fired at a second target while submerged, and heard explosions, but was unable to confirm a sinking. She pursued the third tanker, firing a spread of four torpedoes early on the morning of 5 January 1944. A mushroom-shaped fire rose as the last two torpedoes struck, and &quot;Kiyo Maru&quot; sank, leaving an oil slick and scattered debris. During the patrol, &quot;Rasher&quot; planted mines off the approaches to Saigon harbor. Prematurely exploding torpedoes and vigilant escorts frustrated her attacks on convoys on 11 January and 17 January. A week later she returned to Fremantle.

=== Third and fourth war patrols, February – June 1944 ===
&quot;Rasher&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol from 19 February to 4 April 1944, was conducted in the Java Sea–Celebes Sea area. On 25 February she attacked a Japanese convoy off Bali. First she sank the cargo ships &quot;Tango Maru&quot;, killing thousands of Imperial Japanese Army soldiers, Javanese &quot;rōmusha&quot; forced laborers, and Allied prisoners-of-war. Later in the same attack she sank &quot;Ryusei Maru&quot;, killing up to 5,000 of her complement of Japanese Army soldiers, Indian prisoners of war, and rōmusha forced labourers. Then, after transiting Makassar Strait into the Celebes Sea, she destroyed the cargo ship &quot;Nattai Maru&quot; on 3 March.

On 19 March 1944, &quot;Rasher&quot; sighted the Japanese submarine as &quot;Ro-112&quot; was surfacing in the Java Sea north of Bali off Cape Bungkulan at . &quot;Rasher&quot;′s watch officer described &quot;Ro-112&quot; as a black submarine of the &quot;&quot;Ro-51&quot; class.&quot; At 11:49, &quot;Rasher&quot; fired four Mark 14 Mod 3 torpedoes at &quot;Ro-112&quot;, but &quot;Ro-112&quot; turned to port and evaded them. En route home, however, &quot;Rasher&quot; met the 2,750-ton freighter &quot;Nichinan Maru&quot; on 27 March and sank her.

&quot;Rasher&quot; returned to the Makassar Strait-Celebes Sea area for her fourth patrol, from 30 April to 23 June 1944. On 11 May, she torpedoed and sank the freighter &quot;Choi Maru&quot;. Next to go down were the converted gunboat &quot;Anshu Maru&quot; on 29 May and the tanker &quot;Shioya Maru&quot; in the Celebes Sea off Manado on 8 June. On 14 June, the cargo ship &quot;Koan Maru&quot; went to the bottom, after taking a spread of torpedoes aft and capsizing.

=== Fifth war patrol, 22 July – 3 September 1944 ===
Commander Henry G. Munson relieved Commander Laughon as commanding officer of &quot;Rasher&quot;. &quot;Rasher&#x27;s&quot; fifth patrol was spent largely with in the South China Sea west of Luzon.

Thirty miles south of Scarborough Shoal at 2255 5 August, &quot;Rasher&quot; launched a spread of six bow torpedoes at the largest ship in a three-ship convoy. Diving to avoid being rammed, &quot;Rasher&#x27;s&quot; crew counted five hits and heard the sounds of a ship breaking up as the army cargo ship &quot;Shiroganesan Maru&quot; went down.

&quot;Rasher&quot; observed nine successive aircraft contacts to the north on the afternoon of 18 August and deduced these were air patrols for an important convoy. That dark, rainy night &quot;Rasher&quot;&#x27;s radar picked up a convoy of thirteen ships protected by six escorts. After a surfaced approach to , two stern torpedoes were launched at &quot;Teiyo Maru&quot; at 2122. Both torpedoes hit and the tanker loaded with gasoline exploded into a column of flame high, with parts of the ship being blown from the flaming hulk. The escorts fired wildly and laid depth charge patterns astern of &quot;Rasher&quot;. In a second surfaced approach to &quot;Rasher&quot; launched a spread of six bow torpedoes. Three torpedoes hit and sank the 17,000 ton transport &quot;Teia Maru&quot;, killing 2,665 Japanese soldiers, and a fourth torpedo was heard exploding at a timed range of 3900 yards. &quot;Rasher&quot; swung hard to port to launch four stern torpedoes at 2214. Three torpedoes hit and sank the 20,000 ton carrier , which was escorting the convoy, and the fourth torpedo was heard exploding on a more distant ship.

&quot;Rasher&quot; pulled away to reload torpedo tubes and the convoy split into two groups. &quot;Rasher&quot; followed the group moving northwest while &quot;Bluefish&quot; intercepted the remaining ships continuing southwesterly and sank two tankers. &quot;Rasher&quot; launched four bow torpedoes at a range of , and three hits on the cargo-transport &quot;Eishin Maru&quot; caused an ammunition detonation with the pressure wave sweeping over the submarine&#x27;s bridge. The fourth torpedo was heard exploding on a more distant ship. &quot;Rasher&quot; then swung hard right to launch two stern torpedoes. Both torpedoes hit and &quot;Noshiro Maru&quot; slowed to and reversed course. joined the wolfpack and scored hits on two of the surviving transports.

&quot;Rasher&quot; counted sixteen detonations from the eighteen torpedoes fired on 18 August and five detonations for the six fired on 5 August. With all torpedoes expended, &quot;Rasher&quot; set course for Midway. Munson was called into a secret conference at Midway to compare his observations with decrypted Japanese message traffic. Postwar accounting verified &quot;Rasher&quot; had sunk the highest tonnage of any World War II U.S. submarine patrol to that date. That record would be exceeded only once, when sank the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shinano&quot; three months later. &quot;Rasher&quot; proceeded to San Francisco via Hawaii for overhaul at Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard on 11 September. She was given a new 5-inch deck gun, ST radar, and many other upgrades.

=== Sixth, seventh, and eighth war patrols, January – August 1945 ===
Benjamin Ernest Adams Jr. replaced Munson for the sixth war patrol. &quot;Rasher&quot; departed San Francisco on 20 December 1944, arriving at Midway via Pearl Harbor in early January 1945. Her sixth patrol, as a unit of a wolfpack with and , commenced on 29 January, and was conducted in the southern sector of the East China Sea. &quot;Rasher&quot; attacked a pair of ships on 15 February but missed, and approached a convoy the next day but was unable to get in position to attack. A later attack on another convoy also ended in misses. No other suitable targets were found, only small patrol craft, hospital ships, and ubiquitous patrol aircraft. The patrol ended on 16 March 1945 at Guam.
Charles Derick Nace replaced Adams for the seventh and eighth patrols. &quot;Rasher&#x27;s&quot; seventh patrol, 17 April to 29 May 1945, was little more rewarding than the sixth. On lifeguard station off Honshū, she riddled two small craft with gunfire. No aircraft came down in her area, and she returned to Midway on 29 May.

&quot;Rasher&quot; departed Midway 23 June 1945 to take lifeguard station off southern Formosa. No Allied planes were downed in her area before orders arrived to proceed to the Gulf of Siam. While she was en route the war ended, and &quot;Rasher&quot; returned to the Philippines. She departed Subic Bay on 31 August arriving New York on 6 October, via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal. Following deactivation overhaul, she was decommissioned 22 June 1946 and was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New London, Connecticut.

&quot;Rasher&quot; was credited with sinking 99,901 tons of Japanese shipping, the third highest total for US submarines in World War II. However, a Japanese destroyer credited as sunk by sister ship is given a name that never existed and may have been a case of mistaken identity. If the tonnage credited for this ship is removed from the record of &quot;Flasher&quot;, then &quot;Rasher&quot; becomes the second highest-scoring US submarine for tonnage.

=== Service as radar picket submarine, 1953–1960 ===
She was placed in commission in reserve at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 14 December 1951, Lt. V. D. Ely in command. After being reclassified as a radar picket submarine, SSR-269, she commenced conversion which continued after she decommissioned 28 May 1952. After extensive hull and interior alterations at Philadelphia Navy Yard, she was recommissioned 22 July 1953, Lt. Comdr. R. W. Stecher in command. She departed New London on 12 November, arriving San Diego 17 December via Guantanamo Bay and the Panama Canal.

The following two years were spent off the west coast in operations from Washington state to Acapulco. On 4 January 1956, she deployed to the 7th Fleet, where she operated with U.S. and SEATO naval units. She returned to San Diego 3 July 1956. Prior to and following a second WestPac deployment from 4 March to 4 September 1958, SSR-269 served in Fleet exercises as an early warning ship, and in ASW training operations.

On 28 December 1959, &quot;Rasher&quot; departed the continental United States for the Far East. While attached to the 7th Fleet, she participated in exercise &quot;Blue Star&quot;, a large-scale American-Nationalist Chinese amphibious exercise. In May 1960, she took part in the Black Ship Festival at Shimoda, Japan, commemorating Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s landing. She returned to San Diego on 20 June 1960.

=== Vietnam War service ===

&quot;Rasher&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-269, on 1 July 1960, with conversion being accomplished at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Involved in maintaining fleet readiness until mid-August 1962 when she deployed to WestPac, &quot;Rasher&quot; continued to exhibit her usual high standards of performance. She returned to San Diego on 15 February 1963, and was overhauled that summer.

During the next year, AGSS-269 was engaged in strike exercises involving other American and Canadian ships. Her next deployment, beginning on 3 August 1964, involved support of 7th Fleet operations off Vietnam, as well as ASW exercises with SEATO allies.

After returning to San Diego on 5 February 1965, she had ASW and amphibious training. Her next WestPac deployment, from 3 January to 17 July 1966, included amphibious and ASW training support for Republic of Korea, Nationalist Chinese, and Thai units, as well as operations with the 7th Fleet off Vietnam.

&quot;Rasher&quot; spent the remainder of her commissioned career providing training services off the coast of California to UDT and ASW units.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Rasher&quot; was decommissioned 27 May 1967, and later was reclassified &quot;unclassified miscellaneous submarine&quot; IXSS-269, was towed to Portland, Oregon, where she served as a training submarine for Naval reservists until struck from the Navy List, 20 December 1971.

<doc id="1098073" wikidata="Q1433311" url="?curid=1098073" title="Worry beads">
<text>Worry beads or komboloi/kompoloi (, , &#x27;bead collection&#x27;; plural: , ) is a string of beads manipulated with one or two hands and used to pass time in Greek and Cypriot culture. Unlike the similar prayer beads used in many religious traditions, worry beads have no religious or ceremonial purpose.

==Etymology==
Modern Greek κομπολόι is derived from κομβολόγιον &lt; κόμβος &quot;knot&quot; + -λόγιο &quot;collection&quot;. It is sometimes said that it is short for the phrase &quot;σε κάθε κόμπο προσευχή λέω&quot;, &quot;in every knot I say a prayer&quot;- &quot;κόμπο&quot; &quot;knot&quot;-&quot;λέω&quot; &quot;say&quot; &gt; κόμπο-λέω &gt; κομπολόι. This etymology accounts for the fact that κομπολόι evolved from &quot;κομποσκοίνι&quot;, the Greek word for prayer rope.

==Use==
Worry beads have several uses in Greek culture, including:
*relaxation, enjoyment, and generally passing the time
*as an amulet, to guard against bad luck
*used by people who wish to limit smoking
*as a mark of power and social . This is especially true in the case of expensive worry beads made of silver or amber.

Many prominent Greeks were users and collectors of worry beads, including former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and business magnate Aristotle Onassis.

==Features==

Worry beads may be constructed from any type of bead, although amber, amber resin (such as faturan), and coral are preferred, as they are thought to be more pleasant to handle than non-organic materials such as metal or minerals.

Greek worry beads generally have an odd number of beads, often one more than a multiple of four (e.g. (4×4)+1, (5×4)+1, and so on) or a prime number (usually 17, 19 or 23), and usually have a head composed of a fixed bead (παπάς &quot;priest&quot;), a shield (θυρεός) to separate the two threads and help the beads to flow freely, and a tassel (φούντα). Usually the length of worry beads is approximately two palm widths.

==Usage==
Worry beads can be handled in many different ways. The most common are a quiet method, for indoors, and a noisier method that is acceptable in public places.

===Quiet===

The most common quiet method is to start at one end of the thread or chain, near the shield, and to pull the thread forward using that hand&#x27;s thumb and the side of the index finger until one of the beads is reached. Then the cord is tipped so that the bead falls and hits the shield. This is repeated until all the beads have been tipped and then the user starts over.

===Loud===

The second, louder, method is to divide the beads into two groups. On one end is the shield and a small number of the beads. On the other end is the rest of the beads. Where the two threads are empty, that space is laid between the index and middle fingers. The hand should be in a position where the palm is facing the torso. Then the end behind the hand is swung up and forward so that it hits the other beads, making a noise. 

The threads are then switched back into the space between the index and middle fingers by holding the threads between the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is repeated rhythmically, creating a louder clicking noise than the quiet method. Another method is to hold all of the worry beads in one hand and roll them against each other, creating soft clicking sounds.

===As musical instrument===
Worry beads can be a musical instrument, related to rebetiko. Sound is emitted using a drinking glass and rubbing the lip against the worry bead, which is suspended from one button.

<text>Arthur Anae (born 1945) is a New Zealand politician who served on the Auckland Council. He was an MP from 1996 to 1999, and again from 2000 to 2002. He was part of the National Party, being its first Pasifika MP.

==Early life==
Anae, who was born in 1945, is Samoan, although he was born in Fiji. His family migrated to New Zealand in 1951 when he was five years old.

==Member of Parliament==

Anae first stood for Parliament in the , when he contested the electorate; he came third on that occasion. He first entered Parliament in the 1996 election as a list MP (he did not contest an electorate), but after the 1999 election, missed returning to Parliament by a single place. When Don McKinnon resigned, however, Anae entered Parliament as his replacement. In the 2002 election, Anae was ranked lowly on the party list (in 28th place), could not win the electorate (he came a distant second to Labour&#x27;s Ross Robertson), and was thus not returned to Parliament. At the time, he was highly critical of the National Party for his low list ranking and perceived it as an insult to the Pacific community.

==Local politics==


Anae first stood for Auckland City Council in the 1987 local elections. In October 2004 he was elected to the Manukau City Council from the Ōtara ward. He ran for the mayoralty of Manukau City in the 2007 local body elections, polling third.

In the 2010 Auckland Council elections Anae was elected from the Manukau ward to serve in the newly formed Auckland Council and served as the Chair of the Council&#x27;s Economic Forum. He was re-elected in 2013, but did not stand at the 2016 elections, and opted to leave politics. His seat was won by Efeso Collins at the 2016 elections.

<text>HMNZS &quot;Te Kaha&quot; (F77) is one of ten frigates, and one of two serving in the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). The name &quot;Te Kaha&quot; is Māori, meaning &#x27;fighting prowess&#x27; or &#x27;strength&#x27; (for further information on this term, see Kaha).

==Design and construction==

During the mid-1980s, the RNZN began considering the replacement of their four frigates. Around the same time, a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations forced the New Zealand government to improve ties with local nations. As the Royal Australian Navy was seeking to replace their s with ships nearly identical to what the RNZN wanted, the two nations decided to collaborate on the acquisition in early 1987. Tenders had been requested in 1986, and 12 ship designs (including an airship) were submitted. By August 1987, these were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later ) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. However, the decision to buy the frigates had been highly controversial in New Zealand, primarily because of the cost of purchasing frigate-type ships, plus the idea that the high-capability warships would be too few and too overspecialised for the fisheries and economic exclusion zone (EEZ) patrols expected to be the RNZN&#x27;s core operations. Despite ongoing debate, the New Zealand government agreed to purchase two frigates in addition to the RAN&#x27;s eight, and had an option for two more. This option expired in 1997 without New Zealand exercising it; there were proposals to buy a new or second-hand &quot;Anzac&quot; outside the terms of the original contract, but a lack of political support stopped this developing, and the number built for the RNZN remained at two. The drop in capability and the issue of tying up the &quot;Anzac&quot;s on EEZ patrols when they could be deployed more suitably elsewhere were factors leading to the RNZN&#x27;s Project Protector acquisition program.
The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or ) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . The ships are fitted with a Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout, consisting of two controllable-pitch propellers driven by a single General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU diesel engines: initially the TB83 model, but these were replaced in 2009 with more powerful TB93s. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow surface to air missiles, two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets firing Mark 46 torpedoes. They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (a Phalanx CIWS installed shortly after the frigate&#x27;s completion, supplemented by two Mini Typhoons from 2006 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon missile launchers, and a second Mark 41 launcher (neither of which have been added to the New Zealand ships). The New Zealand &quot;Anzac&quot;s initially operated with a Westland Wasp helicopter, which were later replaced by Kaman SH-2 Seasprites, then Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopters.

&quot;Te Kaha&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 19 September 1994. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 22 July 1995, and commissioned into the RNZN on 22 July 1997. In early 2002, microscopic cracks in &quot;Te Kaha&quot;″s bilge keel and hull plating were discovered. This problem, which was common to the first four ships of the &quot;Anzac&quot; class, was later rectified.

==Operational history==
In 1999, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; pursued Patagonian Toothfish poachers in the Ross Dependency, participated in the INTERFET multinational deployment to East Timor from 19 to 26 September, and operated as part of the Multinational Interception Force in the Persian Gulf.

The frigate was also involved in the Solomon Islands conflict during 2000 and 2001, with several periods as guardship at the capital, Honiara.

In 2002, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, after a four-month flag-showing deployment in Asian waters. The frigate was replaced in the Gulf by &quot;Te Mana&quot; in early 2003.

In 2010 &quot;Te Kaha&quot; and became the first RNZN ships to Visit the USA Mainland since the dissolution of the ANZUS treaty.

In 2012 &quot;Te Kaha&quot; attended Exercise RIMPAC.

On 16 February 2015, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; sailed from New Zealand to Gallipoli, ahead of the 100th Anniversary of the landings there during World War I. After completion of this event, the frigate sailed for the Gulf of Oman where she was assigned to anti-piracy patrols. Following this, she sailed back to New Zealand after participating in the Australian-led exercise Exercise Talisman Saber. The ship returned to New Zealand on 2 August 2015 to family members, senior naval staff and the Maori Cultural group who performed a haka. Also involved in Talisman Saber 2015 was the multi-role vessel, and the fleet tanker, HMNZS &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

In June 2017, the ship&#x27;s deployment in the western Pacific was extended to provide support to the US 7th Fleet after collided with the container ship , killing seven sailors and causing extensive damage to the destroyer. The frigate directly contributed to the escort of , an aircraft carrier replacing in the region.

In September 2021 and &quot;Te Kaha&quot; sailed for an international defence exercise in South East Asia and also interact with the United Kingdom’s Carrier Strike Group (CSG) as it conducts engagement activities in the Indo-Pacific region.

=== Refit ===
In March 2018, &quot;Te Kaha&quot; arrived in Victoria, British Columbia, to undergo a major upgrade of her combat management system to the Lockheed Martin CMS 330, as well as replacing the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow with the new Sea Ceptor surface-to-air missile. The upgrade is expected to cost NZD639 million. In September 2020, the refit of &quot;Te Kaha&quot; was reportedly complete and the ship began post-upgrade sea trials in preparation for a return to active service.

In December 2020 &quot;Te Kaha&quot; completed initial refit upgrades and sea trials and sailed back to Auckland, arriving at the Devonport Naval Base on 20 December. While she has finished the upgrades she has not completed her maintenance routine.

&quot;Te Kaha&quot; suffered minor damage to its bow in May 2024 when it collided with the wharf at Kauri Point Armament Depot. The damage cost $NZ220,000 to repair.

===Honours===
In November 2018, the US Navy awarded &quot;Te Kaha&quot; the Meritorious Unit Commendation for supporting the 7th Fleet after the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; collision.

<text>A relict is a surviving remnant of a natural phenomenon.

==Biology==

A relict (or relic) is an organism that at an earlier time was abundant in a large area but now occurs at only one or a few small areas.

In geology, a relict is a structure or mineral from a parent rock that did not undergo metamorphosis when the surrounding rock did, or a rock that survived a destructive geologic process.

In geomorphology, a relict landform is a landform formed by either erosive or constructive surficial processes that are no longer active as they were in the past.

A glacial relict is a cold-adapted organism that is a remnant of a larger distribution that existed in the ice ages. 

==Human populations==
As revealed by DNA testing, a relict population is an ancient people in an area, who have been largely supplanted by a later group of migrants and their descendants. 

In various places around the world, minority ethnic groups represent lineages of ancient human migrations in places now occupied by more populous ethnic groups, whose ancestors arrived later. For example, the first human groups to inhabit the Caribbean islands were hunter-gatherer tribes from South and Central America. Genetic testing of natives of Cuba show that, in late pre-Columbian times, the island was home to agriculturalists of Taino ethnicity. In addition, a relict population of the original hunter-gatherers remained in western Cuba as the Ciboney people.

==Other uses==
* In ecology, an ecosystem which originally ranged over a large expanse, but is now narrowly confined, may be termed a relict.
* In agronomy, a relict crop is a crop which was previously grown extensively, but is now only used in one limited region, or a small number of isolated regions.
* In real estate law, reliction is the gradual recession of water from its usual high-water mark so that the newly uncovered land becomes the property of the adjoining riparian property owner.
* &quot;Relict&quot; was an ancient term still used in colonial (British) America, and in England and Ireland of that era, now archaic, for a widow; it has come to be a generic or collective term for widows and widowers.
* In historical linguistics, a relict is a word that is a survivor of a form or forms that are otherwise archaic.

<text>In basketball, free throws or foul shots are unopposed attempts to score points by shooting from behind the free-throw line (informally known as the foul line or the charity stripe), a line situated at the end of the restricted area. Free throws are generally awarded after a foul on the shooter by the opposing team, analogous to penalty shots in other team sports. Free throws are also awarded in other situations, including technical fouls, and when the fouling team has entered the &quot;bonus/penalty situation&quot; (after a team commits a requisite number of fouls, each subsequent foul results in free throws regardless of the type of foul committed). Also, depending on the situation, a player may be awarded between one and three free throws. Each successful free throw is worth one point.

==Description==
In the NBA, most players make 70–80% of their attempts. The league&#x27;s best shooters (such as Mark Price, Steve Nash, Steve Kerr, Rick Barry, Larry Bird, Ray Allen, José Calderón, Stephen Curry, Reggie Miller, Kevin Durant, and Dirk Nowitzki) can make roughly 90% of their attempts over a season, while notoriously poor shooters (e.g. Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Andre Drummond, Andris Biedrins, Chris Dudley, Ben Wallace, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Ben Simmons, and Dennis Rodman) may struggle to make 50% of them. During a foul shot, a player&#x27;s feet must both be completely behind the foul line.

==Awarding free throws==
There are many situations when free throws can be awarded.

The first and most common is when a player is fouled while in the act of shooting. If the player misses the shot during the foul, the player receives either two or three free throws depending on whether the shot was taken in front of or behind the three-point line. If, despite the foul, the player still makes the attempted shot, the number of free throws is reduced to one, and the basket counts. This is known as a three-point or four-point play, depending on the value of the made basket. &quot;And-One&quot; is also a popular term for this type of free throw.

The second is when the fouling team is in the team bonus (or foul penalty) situation. This happens when, in a single period, a team commits a set number of fouls whether or not in the act of shooting. In FIBA, (W)NBA and NCAA women&#x27;s play, the limit is four fouls per quarter; in the NBA, starting with the fifth foul (fourth in overtime), or the second in the final 2 minutes if the team has less than 5 fouls (4 in OT), the opposing team gets two free throws. The WNBA follows the NBA&#x27;s rules regarding reset of the team foul count in the final 2 minutes of any period (including overtime). In FIBA and NCAA women&#x27;s basketball, the fouled player also shoots two free throws starting with the opponent&#x27;s fifth foul in a period, considering that team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it for purposes of accrued team fouls. In NCAA men&#x27;s basketball, beginning with the seventh foul of the half, one free throw is awarded; if the player makes the free throw, another is given. This is called shooting a &quot;one-and-one&quot;. Starting with the tenth foul of the half, two free throws are awarded. In addition, overtime is considered an extension of the second half for purposes of accumulated team fouls. Free throws are not awarded for offensive fouls (most often charging fouls), even if the team fouled is in the bonus. The number of fouls that triggers a penalty is higher in college men&#x27;s basketball because the game is divided into two 20-minute halves, as opposed to quarters of 12 minutes in the NBA or 10 minutes in the WNBA, college women&#x27;s basketball, or FIBA play (the college women&#x27;s game was played in 20-minute halves before 2015–16). As in professional play, a foul in the act of shooting is a two- or three-shot foul, depending on the value of the shot attempt, with one free throw being awarded if the shot is good.

Free throws are normally taken by the fouled player. If a player is injured upon being fouled and cannot shoot free throws; in college, the opposing team&#x27;s coach may designate any player in the game at the time of the foul to shoot free throws in the place of the injured player; in the NBA, the opposing team designates the player to shoot, and the injured player cannot return unless the foul committed was a flagrant-2, in which case the player&#x27;s own team also gets to pick the replacement shooter. The opposing team chooses a replacement shooter if the player fouled is ejected (such as participating in a fight) before taking their free throws.

If a player, coach, or team staff (e.g., doctor, statistician) shows poor sportsmanship, which may include arguing with a referee, or commits a technical violation (delay of game, excessive time outs, or when a team has no eligible players remaining after a player has fouled out or subsequently the last player to foul out must re-enter the game, the latter two are NBA rules) that person may get charged with a more serious foul called a technical foul. In the NBA and in FIBA, a technical foul results in one free-throw attempt for the other team. Under NCAA rules, technical fouls are divided into &quot;Class A&quot; (violent or serious unsportsmanlike conduct) and &quot;Class B&quot; (less egregious violations such as hanging on the rim or delay of game). Class A technicals result in two free throws, and Class B technicals result in one. At all levels, the opposing team may choose any player who is currently on the court to shoot the free throws and is then awarded possession of the ball after the free throws. Since there is no opportunity for a rebound, these free throws are shot with no players on the lane.

Finally, if a referee deems a foul extremely aggressive, or that it did not show an attempt to play the ball, the referee can call an even more severe foul, known as an &quot;unsportsmanlike foul&quot; in international and NCAA women&#x27;s play or a &quot;flagrant foul&quot; in the NBA and NCAA men&#x27;s basketball. This foul is charged against the player (who, depending on the severity of the offense, can even be ejected), and the opponent gets two free throws and possession of the ball afterward. Unlike technical fouls, the player fouled must shoot the awarded free throws.

Fouls &quot;away from the ball&quot; (fouls that do not occur on the shooter or near the ball) are handled like the second case above in most situations. Many times defenders hold their opponent to prevent them from catching an in-bound pass or fight through screens and thus are called for fouls. These fouls are almost always treated as normal personal fouls. In the NBA, when there are only two minutes left on the clock of either half, off-ball fouls when the fouling team is over the limit are rewarded with one free throw and possession of the ball. It is therefore common for a losing team to deliberately single out its opponent&#x27;s poor free-throw shooters, regardless of their dominance in other aspects of the game (as in the cases of Ben Wallace and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal), as the targets of deliberate fouls until the two-minute mark, after which the losing team plays intense defense for the rest of the game; this strategy is known as the &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot;. It is believed that this rule was instituted because of Wilt Chamberlain. Previously, teams had been allowed to foul any player on the court regardless of whether that player had possession of the ball, with only two free throws awarded to the fouled player. This motivated teams to chase poor free-throw shooters, such as Chamberlain, around the court in an attempt to foul him in an effort to extend the game. To discourage this practice, the NBA changed the rule to award one free throw and possession of the ball to a player who has fouled away from the ball in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter. This rule does not apply in international or NCAA play and in fact, plays a very vital strategic role in the NCAA Tournament.

Effective in October 2022, FIBA established a new category of personal foul that it calls a &quot;throw-in foul&quot;. This category only applies in the last 2 minutes of any period (quarter or overtime). Any personal foul by the defense on an offensive player while the ball is out of bounds and either in the hands of the referee or at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in results in 1 free throw and possession.

3x3, FIBA&#x27;s version of the half-court three-on-three game, has its own unique free-throw rules.
* No free throws are awarded for the first 6 team fouls during a game (regulation 3x3 games are played in a single period). Exceptions are shooting fouls, technical fouls, and unsportsmanlike and disqualifying fouls.
* In standard free-throw shooting situations, only one free throw is awarded. This matches normal scoring, in which baskets inside the &quot;three-point&quot; arc are worth 1 point and those from outside the arc are worth 2 points.
* A player fouled on a missed basket attempt normally receives a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot (either 1 or 2).
* A player fouled on a made basket normally receives one free throw.
* A team enters the bonus once its opponent has committed its seventh foul of the game. On team fouls 7, 8, and 9, the fouled player receives two free throws. Starting with the 10th team foul, the fouled player receives two free throws &quot;and&quot; the non-offending team receives possession of the ball. This supersedes the standard rule for shooting fouls (whether the basket was made or missed).
* Technical fouls result in one free throw for the non-offending team, and add 1 to the offending team&#x27;s foul count. No additional free throws are awarded.
* Unsportsmanlike fouls result in two free throws. Disqualifying fouls, including a player&#x27;s second unsportsmanlike foul (which automatically results in ejection), result in two free throws and possession. Both types add 2 fouls to the team foul count, but no additional free throws are awarded.
* As in standard full-court rules, offensive fouls never result in free throws.
* Double fouls never result in free throws, even if one or both of the fouls are unsportsmanlike or disqualifying.

==Procedure==
Free throws are organized in procession. The shooter takes his place behind the free-throw line ( from the base line, from the front of the basket). All the other players must stand in their correct places until the ball leaves the shooter&#x27;s hands: up to four people in the NCAA rules and three people in the FIBA rules from the defensive team and two people from the shooting team line up along the sides of the restricted area (keyhole, paint, lane). These players are usually the ones that rebound the ball. Three line up on each side. A defensive player always takes the place closest to the basket.

The remaining players must remain behind the three-point line and the &quot;free-throw line extended&quot; (an imaginary line extended from the free-throw line in both directions to the sidelines).

Leaving their designated places before the ball leaves the shooter&#x27;s hands, or interfering with the ball, are violations. In addition, the shooter must release the ball within five seconds (ten seconds in the United States) and must not step on or over the free-throw line until the ball touches the hoop. Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point. A violation by the shooter cancels the free throw; a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed; a violation by the offensive team or a shot that completely misses the hoop results in the loss of possession to the defensive team (only if it is on the last free throw).

Under FIBA rules, if the shooter does not commit a violation, and the ball goes in the basket, the attempt is successful, regardless of violations committed by any member of the non-shooting team.

==Free throws awarded (NBA)==






&lt;br&gt;1 Penalty applies to fouls in excess of four in a regulation period or in excess of three in an overtime period. If a team has not committed its foul quota by the two minute mark of a period, it shall be allowed one foul before the penalty applies. Offensive fouls do not count toward this total.
&lt;br&gt;2 Defensive fouls committed during an inbounds pass prior to the ball being released result in two free throws regardless of the penalty situation.
&lt;br&gt;3 In the NBA, a team must have five players on the court at all times. If a team is down to five players because of injuries and players with six fouls, and a player commits his sixth foul, he remains in the game and a technical foul is charged. The technical foul penalty of one free throw applies.

===Historical===
Before the 1954–55 season, the NBA established the rule that a backcourt foul would result in a &quot;three to make two&quot; situation (up to three attempts to make two free throws) if the violating team was over the team foul limit. By 1979, the rule had been extended to the penalty situation for flagrant fouls, fouls made in the act of shooting (resulting in a miss), and fouls due to the swinging of the elbows. Prior to the 1981–82 season, this rule and the related &quot;two to make one&quot; rule were abolished.

In 1956, in response to reports that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk free throws, the NCAA established a rule requiring that free-throw shooters keep both feet behind the free-throw line during an attempt. The NBA later adopted this rule.

Starting with the 2017-18 season, in order to reduce wasted time, the NBA implemented a rule change that the free throw shooter may not walk back beyond the three-point line in between free throws. While this did not affect most players, in at least the case of Russell Westbrook, it changed his prior routine of walking back nearly to half-court between shots. His free throw percentage dropped from 82.3% for the nine years prior to the rule change, to 68.5% for the 7 1/2 years since. 

==Strategy==

As mentioned earlier, some players are notoriously bad free-throw shooters. Historical examples of star players who were poor shooters include Wilt Chamberlain, Ben Wallace, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. This allows a strategy where a team intentionally fouls this player, hoping that he will miss one or both shots and the defending team will re-gain possession of the ball. This strategy was dubbed Hack-a-Shaq when famously used on Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond have been subjected to this strategy as well, as have other players.

It can be advantageous for a trailing team to intentionally foul late in a close game. While this allows the leading team to shoot free throws and increase their lead, it also stops the clock, similar to a time out in football (in basketball, a time out may only be called by a team with possession of the ball). Additionally, it allows the trailing team the chance to take possession if the second free throw is missed, and if it is made awards possession outright to the trailing team. Therefore, many teams substitute players with high free-throw percentages when they are leading late in games to combat this strategy. It is seen as a last resort strategy with little chance of success, but if it is not employed the leading team may run out the clock and end the game.

A defensive team leading by three may foul an offensive team intentionally late in the game, if the game clock is no greater than a couple of seconds. In such circumstances, the opposing team would most likely not have enough time for multiple possessions. Down three points, the opposing team&#x27;s obvious strategy would be to attempt a three-pointer to try to send the game into overtime; however, the leading team may attempt to foul the trailing team before a shot is attempted, as this would lead to only two free throws which is not enough to tie the game. If the trailing team is placed into the situation of shooting two free throws, they must attempt to intentionally miss the second free throw in the hopes of securing the offensive rebound (which is harder than normal with free throws, as the defending team is automatically given position) and scoring before the game clock expires – if the first free throw is made, a two-pointer would tie the game, and a three-pointer would win the game; if the first free throw is missed, only a three-pointer would tie the game. Theoretically, adopting this strategy makes a leading team four times more likely to win the game than allowing the trailing team to attempt a three-pointer.

==Technique==

To shoot a free throw, a player must position their body with both feet fully behind the free throw line. Players will either position both feet square to the line or will have one foot forward in a split stance. While standing as close to the line as possible is typically advantageous, players like Nick Van Exel have been known to take a few steps (1–2 feet) back from the line to shoot from a farther distance. Many players perform a &quot;ritual&quot; before shooting free throws; this can range from bouncing the ball off the floor or touching their shoes to more unusual and iconic rituals, such as Gilbert Arenas wrapping the ball around his waist 3 times or Jeff Hornacek touching his face once for each of his children. Once prepared, the player will bend his legs to generate power, extend the ball over his head, and shoot in a form similar to the typical basketball jump shot, although they will not always leave the ground during a free throw.

Nearly every adult professional player shoots free throws in this overhand style, despite both theoretical and practical demonstrations that the underhand style (aka &quot;granny-style&quot;) usually produces better average results.

NBA player and underhand free-throw shooter Rick Barry retired in 1980 while ranked 1st in NBA history at the time with a 90.0% average of successful free throws. There have been very few professional players who have used this technique since; the vast majority of players decline to use the technique for fear of ridicule or for similar reasons unrelated to performance. Famously bad free throw shooter Shaquille O&#x27;Neal once said in an interview, &quot;I told Rick Barry I&#x27;d rather shoot 0% than shoot underhand. I&#x27;m too cool for that.&quot; Professionals who have adopted the style include Chinanu Onuaku and Barry&#x27;s son Canyon.

<text>Ted Henter (born 1950 in Panama Canal Zone) is an American computer programmer and businessperson known for having invented the JAWS screen reader for the blind. He studied engineering, but learned computer programming and started his own business after becoming blind in a car accident in 1978, which put an end to a promising career as an international motorcycle racer.

In 1987, he teamed up with businessperson Bill Joyce, who together founded Henter-Joyce in St. Petersburg, Florida. Henter was president and led the operation and provided technology direction while Joyce acted as a silent partner. Henter-Joyce produced JAWS, a screen reader for personal computers using MS-DOS, and later Microsoft Windows.

After becoming blind, Henter rediscovered waterskiing, and started competing in waterskiing events. He won six times out of seven competitions in the United States and twice in international competition. He retired in 1991 after winning the overall Gold medal in the United States and World Championship for Disabled Skiers.

Henter-Joyce merged with Arkenstone and Blazie Engineering in 2000 to form Freedom Scientific. Henter currently remains on the board of directors of Freedom Scientific, and in 2002 he founded Henter Math, to produce software that helps the &quot;pencil-impaired&quot; with mathematics.

<doc id="1098093" wikidata="Q16145584" url="?curid=1098093" title="Alec Neill">
<text>Alexander George Neill (born 22 July 1950 in Dunedin, New Zealand) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a member of parliament for the National Party on three non-consecutive occasions between 1990 and 2002 and was later a member of the Canterbury Regional Council from 2003 until 2010.

==Early life and career==
Neill was born in Dunedin, the youngest son of Alf Neill QC, then a prominent barrister practising in Dunedin. Alec Neill was raised at Allans Beach on the Otago Peninsula, attended the Hoopers Inlet Primary School and then attended St Kevin&#x27;s College, Oamaru, and the University of Otago where he graduated with an LLB.

He commenced his law career with Ross Dowling Marquet and Griffen in Dunedin before shifting to Oamaru in 1974, joining solicitors George Berry and Evan Alty in the firm of Hjorring Tait and Farrell. Neill became a partner on 1 May 1976 (then aged 25) and the firm was rebranded as Berry Alty and Neill. He remained a partner of the firm until elected to Parliament in 1990. After losing the 1996 election he relocated to Christchurch in 1997 and returned to legal practice.

Neill is married to Diane and they have a blended family of five children.

==Member of Parliament ==


Jim Sutton of the Labour Party had won the Waitaki electorate in 1984 and 1987, though only by 89 votes on the second occasion. Neill was selected as the new National candidate for the 1990 election. He defeated Sutton, who was by that time the Minister of Agriculture, by 2,095 votes and was one of 27 National candidates who defeated Labour incumbents. He was comfortably re-elected in the 1993 election.

Neill was never appointed to a ministerial position in the Fourth National Government, but he was the chairman of the planning and development committee, which oversaw the passing of the Resource Management Act 1991, and of the justice and law reform committee.

The 1996 election was the first conducted under the mixed-member proportional representation system. The existing 99 electorates under the previous first-past-the-post voting system were reduced to 60 and Neill&#x27;s Waitaki electorate was one of those disestablished. He sought National&#x27;s selection for the enlarged Otago electorate but lost to newcomer Gavan Herlihy. Neill opted not to seek the nomination in the new Timaru electorate, which also took in area from Waitaki. Neill stood as a list-only candidate in 1996 and 1999 but the party did not secure enough votes for his election on either occasion.

Despite this, Neill entered Parliament twice as a list MP to succeed retiring incumbents. In January 1999, Paul East resigned from Parliament to take up a diplomatic post, and Neill became a list MP until the election that November, where he was again unsuccessful in being re-elected. In January 2001, Simon Upton resigned; Neill was again the next candidate on the National Party list, allowing him to return to Parliament. He was junior whip under National leader Jenny Shipley until October 2001 and National&#x27;s spokesperson for local government and conservation under Bill English until the 2002 election.

In the 2002 election, Neill was ranked 22 on the National Party list and also contested Wigram, where he placed third behind the Progressive leader Jim Anderton and Labour candidate Mike Mora. National polled very poorly and Neill was not returned to Parliament. He did not stand in the 2005 election.

==Member of Canterbury Regional Council ==
Neill served seven years on Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury) as a councillor in the Christchurch West constituency, including seven months as chair.

Neill and future National MP Nicky Wagner were elected to fill the Christchurch West constituency positions of the retired councillor Neil Cherry and the deceased councillor Peter Yeoman. Neill was re-elected in the 2004 and 2007 local elections. Neill was the leader of the right-leaning Independent Citizens grouping and, after the 2007 elections, sought the chairmanship of the council but lost to Sir Kerry Burke by one vote.

The 2007–2010 term saw the councillors being removed by the National Government. Before urgent legislation was passed on 30 March 2010 to enable the Government-appointed commissioners to provide the region&#x27;s governance, concerns about poor regional relationships and water management had surfaced, including through a Government-commissioned review led by former deputy prime minister Wyatt Creech. Neill had been elected chair of the council in September 2009, when Burke lost a confidence motion, and remained on the council until it was discharged on 1 May 2010.

==Post-political career==
After leaving the council, Neill returned to legal practice and said he did not intend to again stand for public office. He has worked as a resource management commissioner and served on the board of the Rata Foundation (formerly the Canterbury Community Trust) from 2009 to 2013. He was a director of SBS Bank from 2012 to 2015. He is a commissioner in the Office of the Chief Freshwater Commissioner.

<doc id="1098100" wikidata="Q6974911" url="?curid=1098100" title="National Physical Fitness Award">
<text>The National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) is a standard physical fitness test for Singaporeans as part of Singapore&#x27;s Sports For Life programme. NAPFA was launched in January 1982 as a standardised assessment of overall fitness for the general population.

All primary and secondary schools in Singapore are required to participate in NAPFA tests on alternate years, in April for secondary schools and in August for primary schools respectively. It is one of the three criteria for banding for the Trim and Fit (TAF) Awards, other than the fitness index and the percentage of overweight students. Singaporeans studying within Singapore&#x27;s tertiary education system, or those who have graduated from the education system are not required to participate, but are strongly encouraged to do so.

Despite the requirement for mandatory participation, failing to achieve at least a passing grade (E) usually does not carry any academic consequences for primary and secondary school students, although students are still strongly encouraged to pass. Exceptions include sports-based schools such as the Singapore Sports School, and might yield non-academic consequences, such as the requirement to further retake the tests or the required participation in the Trim and Fit programme.

Before the changes to the IPPT, a minimum of a silver grade allowed Singaporean males who have reached the age of 18 to perform just 9 weeks of Basic Military Training (BMT) in their National Service (NS) period, instead of the usual 17 weeks if the silver grade is not attained. Those without at least a NAPFA Silver have to undergo an extra eight-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) prior to their nine-week BMT. In addition, medically fit servicemen who have attained a silver grade enjoy a two-month exemption at the end of their full-time NS period because exemption from PTP would mean a reduction of two months of NS, making the entire NS shortened to one year and ten months. With the new IPPT system, the exemption criteria for PTP is now 61 points based on sit-up, push-up and 2.4 km run done in a single session, graded according to the IPPT scoring system.

According to data from the Ministry of Education, the percentage of students passing NAPFA has been increasing steadily over the years, from 58% in 1992 to 74% in 1998, and further to 80% in 2007.

== Testing ==
NAPFA involves a series of five stations and a 2.4-km (1.5-mile) Walk-Run for secondary school students and above or a 1.6-km (1-mile) Walk-Run for primary school students. All of the 5 station tests are attempted on the same day, with a 2–5-minute rest period permitted between stations. The Walk-Run item is usually attempted on a different day, although sometimes a 2-week window limit is set.

The test items are:
# Sit-ups: Maximum in one minute
# Pull-ups (secondary schools)/Push-ups (ITE/Poly/JC/MI) (for males 15 years old and above) or Inclined Pull-ups (for females and males below 15 years old): Maximum in half-a-minute
# Sit-and-Reach: Maximum distance
# Shuttle Run: Minimum time for two laps of fixed distance
# Standing Broad Jump: Maximum distance
# 2.4-km Run (1.5-mile Run) [1.6-km Run (1-mile run) for primary schools]: Minimum time on firm and level surface

Performances are then compared to a chart and the grades from A to F for each test item. An A grade constitutes excellent performance and an E grade constitutes barely passing. On the other hand, an F grade indicates that the participant has failed that test item.

There are points awarded for each station based on the grades that the participant gets for the particular station.

The points are then totalled up, resulting in either of the three awards, bronze, silver and gold.

<text>The Adams Prize is a prize awarded each year by the Faculty of Mathematics at St John&#x27;s College to a UK-based mathematician for distinguished research in mathematical sciences.

The prize is named after the mathematician John Couch Adams and was endowed by members of St John&#x27;s College and approved by the senate of the university in 1848, to commemorate Adams&#x27; role in the discovery of the planet Neptune. Originally open only to Cambridge graduates, the current stipulation is that the mathematician must reside in the UK and be under forty years of age.

The Adams Prize is awarded in three parts: the first is paid directly to the candidate; another third is paid to the candidate&#x27;s institution to fund research expenses; and the final third is paid on publication of a survey paper in the winner&#x27;s field in a major mathematics journal.

The prize has been awarded to many well-known mathematicians, including
James Clerk Maxwell and Sir William Hodge. The first female recipient, in 2002, was Susan Howson, then a lecturer at the University of Nottingham, for her work on number theory and elliptic curves.

==Subject area==
* 2015–16: Applied analysis
* 2016–17: Statistical analysis of big data
* 2017–18: The mathematics of astronomy and cosmology
* 2018–19: The mathematics of networks

<text>Arthur Edward Moore (9 February 1876 – 7 January 1963) was an Australian politician. He was the Country and Progressive National Party Premier of Queensland, from 1929 to 1932. He was the only Queensland Premier not to come from the ranks of the Labor Party between 1915 and 1957. Although successful in achieving the unity of the conservative forces in Queensland for an extended period, Moore&#x27;s abilities were tested by the onset of the Great Depression and like many other governments in Australia and elsewhere his was unable to endure the formidable challenges it posed.

==Early career==
Moore was born in Napier, New Zealand in 1876. His family moved to Australia in 1887 when his father became a bank manager in Melbourne. The younger Moore arrived in Queensland in 1898, where he was a dairy farmer on the Darling Downs and the owner of two cheese factories. He followed what was to be the standard National Party road to office for many years – a career in local government, becoming member of Rosalie Shire Council in 1905 and its chairman from 1911-1929 and the president of the Queensland Local Authorities Association.

Moore entered the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1915 representing the Farmers Union (a forerunner to the Country Party) in the seat of Aubigny. This election saw the defeat of the government of Digby Denham and the election of the Labor government of Thomas J. Ryan. The non-Labor forces in Queensland were in a period of chronic disunity, with the Country Party coming into conflict with what was then known as the Queensland Liberal Party but would later also be called the National and then the United Party. Bitter strife within and between these various parties was a contributing factor to Labor&#x27;s election victories in 1920, and 1923.

Moore, who had been made Deputy Leader of the Opposition in 1920, was among those Country Party members who, suspicious of United Party motives, refused to join a proposed Country-United merger mooted in the January 1923. The feuding had begun to subside by 1924, when on 9 April Moore was elected Leader of the Opposition, and then in the next year the Country and United parties joined to form the Country Progressive Party, amid criticisms from members of the organisational wings of both former organisations. The Party changed its name in December 1925 to the Country and Progressive National Party (CPNP). The CPNP gained sixteen seats in the elections of 1926 without winning government, and in 1929, amid threats of further division within the CPNP ranks, Moore won a large victory against William McCormack, plagued with his own internal problems, to become Premier.

==The Moore government==

Moore&#x27;s government soon had to deal with the effects of the Great Depression that was wreaking havoc on the economy throughout Australia. Moore responded by following a policy of deflation, limiting government expenditure and attempting to scale back wages and worker&#x27;s entitlements. In order to assist the state&#x27;s finances he implemented an income tax, much to the chagrin of many supporters. His proposals for economic assistance to wool growers in 1931 met with opposition from banks and financial institutions. He also came under fire in 1931 when divisions in the CPNP&#x27;s parliamentary party emerged over the restoration of the Legislative Council, abolished in 1921. Moore came under repeated attack from the conservative &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot;.

During his term, Moore also redrew the electoral boundaries, becoming one of the many Queensland premiers accused of gerrymandering. The size of the Legislative Assembly was reduced from 72 to 62 seats, mainly accomplished by the abolition of sitting Labor members&#x27; seats.

In 1932 Moore instituted a Royal Commission to investigate former Labor Premier E. G. Theodore over his alleged corruption in what was known as the Mungana affair. Moore was accused by many in the Labor movement of orchestrating the Commission&#x27;s activities in such a way as to deal maximum political damage to the Scullin federal government. The elections of that year confirmed his party&#x27;s loss of standing with the onset of the Great Depression, as well as continued internal bickering. The CPNP was defeated by Labor under William Forgan Smith.

==After defeat==
Moore kept the CPNP together as leader until the disastrous defeat of 1935, where it won sixteen out of 62 seats. In the aftermath, the CPNP split, and most of its rural members refounded the Country Party. Holding Moore responsible for the 1935 debacle, Country Party MPs insisted on Moore&#x27;s resignation as leader. Moore stood down in favour of Ted Maher. He remained on the opposition front bench until his retirement in 1941.

Moore died in 1963. He was accorded a state funeral at Brisbane&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral and later cremated.

<doc id="1098113" wikidata="Q7688176" url="?curid=1098113" title="Tatkreis">
<text>Tatkreis (&quot;Action Circle&quot;) was a Völkisch movement which existed during the era of the Weimar Republic. They followed the beliefs of most Völkisch movements but claimed the current republic &quot;corrupt and sterile beyond repair&quot; and called for &quot;freedom and rebirth&quot; in Germany. Tatkreis used a combination of nationalism and revolutionary Right-wing populism to generate passion within their ranks in a fashion that pre-dated National Socialism and was no doubt an influence.

Tatkreis called for an end to capitalism and promoted a neomercantilist ideology, a system which encourages exports and discourages imports, with a high level of state manipulation of the economy introducing high tariffs, and called for German self-sufficiency. This idea was easily received by the citizens of Germany, who lived in a time of depression after World War I. The middle-class craftsmen and shopkeepers were a majority in Germany and thus a key demographic.

At the end of the 1920s, Tatkreis was formed around the publication &quot;Die Tat&quot; (&quot;Action&quot;). Edited by Hans Zehrer, it produced a circulation of over 25,000 in 1933. After the rise to power of the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), Tatkreis was dissolved, as were other political parties under Hitler&#x27;s rule. Even before this, the way the NSDAP undermined Tatkreis was by drawing from their membership, as both parties targeted the same types of followers.

<doc id="1098118" wikidata="Q368023" url="?curid=1098118" title="Bill Harris (trombonist)">
<text>Willard Palmer Harris (October 28, 1916 – August 21, 1973) was an American jazz trombonist.

==Biography==
Harris was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

Early in his career, Harris performed with Benny Goodman, Charlie Barnet, and Eddie Condon. He is remembered for his broad, thick tone and quick vibrato, that remained for the duration of each tone.

He joined Woody Herman&#x27;s First Herd in 1944. He was also in the Four Brothers Second Herd during the late 1940s, and he worked with Herman again in the 1950s. He then teamed up with Charlie Ventura and later with Chubby Jackson. Together with Flip Phillips, he became a stalwart of Benny Goodman&#x27;s group in 1959, although it has been said that Goodman was frequently irritated at Harris because of Harris&#x27; indifferent approach to &quot;sight-reading,&quot; the skill of playing previously unseen written music with fluency, an ability which Goodman and trumpeter Harry James both possessed.

As an improviser, Harris seemed comfortable playing among divergent stylists, as shown on Jazz at the Philharmonic recordings, as his &quot;one-off&quot; style seemed to work in any context, from Dixieland, to swing, or bebop.

His solo on &quot;Bijou&quot; with Herman remains a classic, while his idiosyncratic treatment of the ballad, &quot;Everything Happens to Me&quot;, is known for its vocality, and his treatment of the ballad &quot;Everywhere&quot; was inspiration for Roswell Rudd&#x27;s free-contrapuntal &quot;Everywhere.&quot; Later, Harris worked in Las Vegas, Nevada, finally retiring to Florida.

Harris died in Hallandale, Florida, in August 1973, at the age of 56.

<doc id="1098136" wikidata="Q193622" url="?curid=1098136" title="Order (distinction)">
<text>An order is a visible honour awarded by a sovereign state, monarch, dynastic house or organisation to a person, typically in recognition of individual merit, that often comes with distinctive insignia such as collars, medals, badges, and sashes worn by recipients.

Modern honour systems of state orders and dynastic orders emerged from the culture of orders of chivalry of the Middle Ages, which in turn emerged from the Catholic religious orders.

==Terminology==
The word order (), in the case referred to in this article, can be traced back to the chivalric orders, including the military orders, which in turn trace the name of their organisation back to that of the Catholic religious orders.

Orders began to be created &quot;ad hoc&quot; and in a more courtly nature. Some were merely honorary and gradually the &quot;badges&quot; of these orders (i.e. the association) began to be known informally as &quot;orders&quot;. As a result, the modern distinction between &quot;orders&quot; and &quot;decorations&quot; or &quot;insignia&quot; has become somewhat blurred. While some &quot;orders&quot; today retain the original notion of being an association or society of individuals, others make no distinction, and an &quot;order&quot; may even be the name of a decoration.

Most historic chivalric orders imply a membership in a group, typically a confraternity. In a few exclusive European orders, membership is or was also limited in number. Decorations seldom have such limitations. Orders often come in multiple classes, including knights and dames in imitation of the original chivalric orders.

==History==
Modern national orders, orders of merit, and decorations, emerged from the culture of chivalric orders established in the Middle Ages, originally the military orders of the Middle Ages and the Crusades, who in turn grew out of the original Catholic religious orders.

While these chivalric orders were &quot;societies, fellowships and colleges of knights&quot;, founded by the Holy See or European monarchs in imitation of the military orders of the Crusades, granting membership in such societies gradually developed into an honour that could be bestowed in recognition of service or to ensure the loyalty of a certain clientele. Some of modern Europe&#x27;s highest honours, such as the Order of the Golden Fleece, England&#x27;s Order of the Garter, Denmark&#x27;s Order of the Elephant and Scotland&#x27;s Order of the Thistle, were created during that era. They were essentially courtly in nature, characterised by close personal relations between the orders&#x27; members and the orders&#x27; sovereign.

In the contemporary era, 96% of the world&#x27;s states – 196 out of a sample of 204 polities, which includes sovereignty-claiming entities like Abkhazia – were found to use Orders to bestow them upon their own citizens and, as a diplomatic tool, upon foreigners. In total, 133 states even regulate the use of Orders in their constitutions. Only Switzerland, Micronesia, Libya, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, and the Seychelles do not seem to confer official civil orders of merit.

==Orders by fount of honour==
===State orders===

===Dynastic orders===

By the time of the Renaissance, most European monarchs had either acquired an existing order of chivalry, or created new ones of their own, to reward loyal civilian and especially military officials. Such orders remained out of reach to the general public, however, as being of noble rank or birth was usually a prerequisite to being admitted.

In the 18th century, these ideas gradually changed and the orders developed from &quot;honourable societies&quot; to visible honours. An example of this gradual development can be seen in two orders founded by Maria Theresa of Austria. While the Military Order of Maria Theresa (1757) was open to any deserving military officer regardless of social origin, and would grant titles of nobility to those who did not already have them, the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary (1764) still required that one had to have at least four generations of noble ancestors.

Still today, many dynastic orders are granted by royal families to worthy individuals for service and achievements.

==Orders by type==

===Orders of chivalry===
====Military orders====

===Orders of merit===

In 1802 Napoleon created the Legion of Honour (), which could be awarded to any person, regardless of status, for bravery in combat or for 20 years of distinguished service. While still retaining many trappings of an order of chivalry, it was the first modern national order of merit and is still France&#x27;s highest award today. The French Legion of Honour served as the model for numerous modern orders of merit in the Western world, such as the Order of Leopold in Belgium (1832) and the Order of the British Empire in the United Kingdom (1917). Orders of merit based on the French Legion of Honour typically retain five classes in accordance with habits of chivalric orders.

In communist countries, orders of merit usually come in one to three grades, with only a badge worn with or without a ribbon on the chest. An example of a communist order of merit was the one-class Order of Lenin of the Soviet Union (1930). Unlike Western orders, however, communist orders could be awarded more than once to an individual. After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the 1990s, most Eastern European countries reverted to the Western-style orders originally established before the rise of communism.

Today, many countries have some form of order of merit or national decorations. Both Thailand&#x27;s Order of the White Elephant and Japan&#x27;s Order of the Rising Sun are over 100 years old. In Canada and some Commonwealth Realms, the Order of Merit is the highest civilian honour. Canada has the Order of Canada and provincial orders such as the Order of Nova Scotia. Australia has the Order of Australia, and New Zealand awards the Order of New Zealand and the New Zealand Order of Merit. The Order of Mapungubwe is the highest honour in South Africa, while the Orders of Luthuli, and the Baobab exist alongside other decorations. The United States awards the Medal of Honor to members of its military for acts of valour, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal to civilians. The Legion of Merit is the only United States decoration which may be issued in award degrees (much like an order of chivalry or certain orders of merit), but award degrees are only made to foreign nationals, typically senior military officers or government officials.

Switzerland does not award any orders. Article 12 of the 1848 Swiss Constitution prohibited the acceptance of honours and titles by Swiss citizens. The current Constitution of 1999 has no specific prohibition, but a federal statute effectively continues the prohibition by barring holders of foreign orders from holding public office. This practice has become common across the globe (albeit other countries usually issue a general prohibition to accept foreign orders, allowing for generous exceptions). Australia, for instance, bans the acceptance of honors from other sovereigns unless the honorific order comes from a list of countries specified in a regulation.

In 1974 the Cabinet of Sweden passed a regulation forbidding the monarch of Sweden from awarding membership in orders to Swedish citizens. The orders themselves were not abolished, but only the Royal Orders of the Seraphim and the Polar Star (both established in 1748) continued to be awarded, and only to foreign citizens and stateless individuals. In 1995 the regulation was altered, allowing the monarch to bestow the two remaining active orders to members of the Swedish royal family. Finally, in 2022, the 48-year-old regulation was repealed by the Swedish Government, the orders were re-opened to Swedish citizens, and the two dormant orders (Sword and Vasa) were revived, with effect from 2023.

Modern orders are usually open to all citizens of a particular country, regardless of status, sex, race or creed; there may be a minimum age for eligibility. Nominations are made either by private citizens or by government officials, depending on the country. An order may be revoked if the holder is convicted of a crime or renounces citizenship. Some people nominated for an award refuse it.

<doc id="1098140" wikidata="Q2384084" url="?curid=1098140" title="Von Economo neuron">
<text>Von Economo neurons, also called spindle neurons, are a specific class of mammalian cortical neurons characterized by a large spindle-shaped soma (or body) gradually tapering into a single apical axon (the that &quot;transmits&quot; signals) in one direction, with only a single dendrite (the ramification that &quot;receives&quot; signals) facing opposite. Other cortical neurons tend to have many dendrites, and the bipolar-shaped morphology of von Economo neurons is unique here.

Von Economo neurons are found in two very restricted regions in the brains of hominids (humans and other great apes): the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the fronto-insular cortex (FI) (which each make up the salience network). In 2008, they were also found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. Von Economo neurons are also found in the brains of a number of cetaceans, African and Asian elephants, and to a lesser extent in macaque monkeys and raccoons. The appearance of von Economo neurons in distantly related clades suggests that they represent convergent evolutionspecifically, as an adaptation to accommodate the increasing size of these distantly-related animals&#x27; brains.

Von Economo neurons were discovered and first described in 1925 by Austrian psychiatrist and neurologist Constantin von Economo (1876–1931).

==Function==
Von Economo neurons are relatively large cells that may allow rapid communication across the relatively large brains of great apes, elephants, and cetaceans. Although rare in comparison to other neurons, von Economo neurons are abundant, and comparatively large, in humans; they are however three times as abundant in cetaceans.

==Evolutionary significance==
The discovery of von Economo neurons in diverse whale species has led to the suggestion that they are &quot;a possible obligatory neuronal adaptation in very large brains, permitting fast information processing and transfer along highly specific projections and that evolved in relation to emerging social behaviors.&quot; The apparent presence of these specialized neurons only in highly intelligent mammals may be an example of convergent evolution.

Their restriction among the primates to great apes leads to the hypothesis that they developed no earlier than 15–20 million years ago, prior to the divergence of orangutans from the African great apes. Recently, primitive forms of von Economo neurons have also been discovered in macaque monkey brains and raccoons.

==In the anterior cingulate cortex==
In 1999, American neuroscientist John Allman and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology first published a report on von Economo neurons found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of hominids but not any other species. Neuronal volumes of ACC von Economo neurons were larger in humans and bonobos than the von Economo neurons of the chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan.

Allman and his colleagues have delved beyond the level of brain infrastructure to investigate how von Economo neurons function at the superstructural level, focusing on their role as &quot;air traffic controllers for emotions ... at the heart of the human social emotion circuitry, including a moral sense&quot;. Allman&#x27;s team proposes that von Economo neurons help channel neural signals from deep within the cortex to relatively distant parts of the brain. Specifically, Allman&#x27;s team found signals from the ACC are received in Brodmann&#x27;s area 10, in the frontal polar cortex, where regulation of cognitive dissonance (disambiguation between alternatives) is thought to occur. According to Allman, this neural relay appears to convey motivation to act, and concerns the recognition of error. Self-controland avoidance of erroris thus facilitated by the executive gatekeeping function of the ACC, as it regulates the interference patterns of neural signals between these two brain regions.

In humans, intense emotion activates the anterior cingulate cortex, as it relays neural signals transmitted from the amygdala (a primary processing center for emotions) to the frontal cortex, perhaps by functioning as a sort of lens to focus the complex texture of neural signal interference patterns. The ACC is also active during demanding tasks requiring judgement and discrimination and when errors are detected by an individual. During difficult tasks, or when experiencing intense love, anger, or lust, activation of the ACC increases. In brain imaging studies, the ACC has specifically been found to be active when mothers hear infants cry, underscoring its role in affording a heightened degree of social sensitivity.

The ACC is a relatively ancient cortical region and is involved with many autonomic functions, including motor and digestive functions, while also playing a role in the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. Significant olfactory and gustatory capabilities of the ACC and fronto-insular cortex appear to have been usurped, during recent evolution, to serve enhanced roles related to higher cognitionranging from planning and self-awareness to role-playing and deception. The diminished olfactory function of humans, compared with other primates, may be related to the fact that von Economo neurons located at crucial neural network hubs have only two dendrites rather than many, resulting in reduced neurological integration.

== In the fronto-insular cortex ==

At a Society for Neuroscience meeting in 2003, Allman reported on von Economo neurons his team found in another brain region, the fronto-insular cortex, a region which appears to have undergone significant evolutionary adaptations in mankindperhaps as recently as 100,000 years ago.

This fronto-insular cortex is closely connected to the insula, a region that is roughly the size of a thumb in each hemisphere of the human brain. The insula and fronto-insular cortex are part of the insular cortex, wherein the elaborate circuitry associated with spatial awareness are found, and where self-awareness and the complexities of emotion are thought to be generated and experienced. Moreover, this region of the right hemisphere is crucial to navigation and perception of three-dimensional rotations.

== Concentrations ==

=== Anterior cingulate cortex ===
The largest number of ACC von Economo neurons are found in humans, fewer in the gracile great apes, and fewest in the robust great apes. In both humans and bonobos they are often found in clusters of 3 to 6 neurons. They are found in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, some cetaceans, and elephants. While total quantities of ACC von Economo neurons were not reported by Allman in his seminal research report (as they were in a later report describing their presence in the frontoinsular cortex, below), his team&#x27;s initial analysis of the ACC layer V in hominids revealed an average of ~9 von Economo neurons per section for orangutans (rare, 0.6% of section cells), ~22 for gorillas (frequent, 2.3%), ~37 for chimpanzees (abundant, 3.8%), ~68 for bonobos (abundant/clusters, 4.8%), ~89 for humans (abundant/clusters, 5.6%).

=== Fronto-insular cortex ===

All of the primates examined had more von Economo neurons in the fronto-insula of the right hemisphere than in the left. In contrast to the higher number of von Economo neurons found in the ACC of the gracile bonobos and chimpanzees, the number of fronto-insular von Economo neurons was far higher in the cortex of robust gorillas (no data for orangutans was given). An adult human had 82,855 such cells, a gorilla had 16,710, a bonobo had 2,159, and a chimpanzee had a mere 1,808despite the fact that chimpanzees and bonobos are great apes most closely related to humans.

=== Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ===
Von Economo neurons have been located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans and elephants. In humans they have been observed in higher concentration in Brodmann area 9 (BA9)mostly isolated, or in clusters of 2, while in Brodmann area 24 (BA24) they have been found mostly in clusters of 2–4.

==Clinical significance==
Abnormal von Economo neuron development may be linked to several psychotic disorders, typically those characterized by distortions of reality, disturbances of thought, disturbances of language, and withdrawal from social contact. Altered von Economo neuron states have been implicated in both schizophrenia and autism, but research into these correlations remains at a very early stage. Frontotemporal dementia involves loss of mostly von Economo neurons. An initial study suggested that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease specifically targeted von Economo neurons; this study was performed with end-stage Alzheimer brains in which cell destruction was widespread, but later it was found that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease does not affect the von Economo neurons.

<text>Lake Monowai (officially Monowai Lake; ) is a large lake () in the southern part of Fiordland National Park, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, 120 kilometres northwest of Invercargill. At an altitude of 196 metres in a long curved valley, the lake appears on maps shaped like a letter &quot;U&quot;. The western part of the lake is set in beautiful mountainous country. It is drained in the northeast by the short Monowai River, which enters the Waiau River eight kilometres to the northeast.
== Power station ==

One of the South Island&#x27;s oldest hydroelectric stations is powered by the waters of the Monowai. It is located at the junction of the Waiau and Monowai Rivers and was opened in 1925.

As a result of the Save Manapouri campaign, plans to raise the level of the lake to create more hydroelectric power were shelved by the Labour government of Norman Kirk in the 1970s, and an independent body, the Guardians of Lake Manapouri, Monowai, and Te Anau was created to oversee management of the lake levels (more information at Manapouri Power Station).

== Accreditations ==

=== ABET accreditation ===
In 2017, the first- and second-cycle Mechatronic Engineering programmes of study at the AGH University Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics, with English as the language of instruction, received ABET accreditation. The AGH University was able to obtain accreditation as the first university in Poland and one of a few in Europe.

=== ENAEE accreditation ===
Four first- and second-cycle programmes of study at the AGH University received accreditation from the European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education, namely, Mining Engineering at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Resource Management, Technical Computer Science, Materials Engineering, and Metallurgy at the Faculty of Metals Engineering and Industrial Computer Science.

== International cooperation ==
The university has concluded more than 280 general agreements on cooperation with higher education institutions around the world. The AGH University has partners in more than 60 countries.

The AGH University participates in international programmes, such as Erasmus+, Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate (EMJD), SMILE, CEEPUS, T.I.M.E., VULCANUS in Japan, HUSTEP, SIT, NAWA, and Spinaker.

The university is a member of the following international organisations: ACRU, EUA, IAU, SEFI, AEUA, KMM-VIN AISBL, C-MAC NSU NPO, T.I.M.E., Magalhaes Network, EIT InnoEnergy, CEEPUS, UNIVERSEH (the European Space University for Earth and Humanity), IROs Forum, SPIRE, and UN Global Compact.

== Business cooperation ==
Cooperation with the economic sector, higher education institutions, and research institutes, as well as participation in Polish and international scientific and industrial consortia allows the AGH University to carry out numerous projects and implement them to the market. Annually, the university concludes about 100 contracts, letters of intent, and agreements on cooperation with industry, central administration, and business environment institutions. Additionally, the AGH University implements about 1,000 research and development contracts annually, among which more than 75% are commissioned by industry.

The innovative potential of the AGH University is based on its intellectual property, which is expressed in the number of obtained patents, trademarks, and utility models, as well as the know-how and experience of its scientists and students. Each year, the university obtains nearly 100 patents and grants several dozens of licenses.

== Campus ==

The AGH University Campus is located in the centre of Krakow. All teaching facilities, seats of faculties, administration, and student organisations, as well as the largest in Poland AGH University Student Campus, together with student clubs and sports and recreation facilities constitute a compact 40-hectare hub.

The Main Building (A-0) was erected between 1923 and 1935. The winning building design was presented at a competition organised in 1913 and won by an architect from Krakow – Sławomir Odrzywolski. After the First World War, the project served as a starting point, and Wacław Krzyżanowski was asked to cooperate thereon; he designed the façade and the interior of the building. The monumental edifice serves as a perfect example of academic classicism in Poland, in style during the 1920s. Currently, the building houses the university&#x27;s central authorities and administration, the Faculty of Geology, Geophysics, and Environmental Protection, and the Geological Museum.

With the development of the university after the war, the campus began to grow. A prospective construction plan of the AGH University, aimed at expanding its premises, was initiated by Professor Walery Goetel and continued throughout the following decades.

In 1964, construction of the student campus began. To date, it remains the largest academic settlement of this kind in Poland. Its designer was Professor Tomasz Mańkowski. Until the end of 1979, 21 student dormitories were erected.

The beginning of the 21st century marks an intense expansion of the entire campus. More than a dozen modern buildings were constructed, and the numerous existing ones have been extended or modernised.

=== AGH University Main Library ===
The Main Library of AGH University is the largest technical library in Krakow and one of the largest in Poland.

The library was established in the academic year 1921–22 and its initial loci were 18 Loretańska Street and subsequently 7 Smoleńsk Street. In 1929, the library collection was transferred to a room within the newly built main building of the Mining Academy at 30 Mickiewicza Avenue. In 1938, the book collection amounted to more than 17,000 volumes. During World War II, the collection was deposited at the Jagiellonian Library. Despite the prohibition introduced by the General Government administration, the books were secretly lent out to MA students and employees. After the war, the collection, reduced by 25%, returned to the main building of the academy.

In 1966, a new free-standing library building was opened, erected due to the efforts of Władysław Piasecki, the library head. Since then, the library has begun to develop dynamically. As a result of launching new programmes of study at the Mining Academy, the library&#x27;s book collection grew and its thematic scope broadened.

In the 1990s, the library underwent digitalisation. Between 1996 and 1999, the interior was renovated and in 2010, the façade of the main library building was modernised, and the decision was taken to expand it and completely remodel it. The modernised building was made available in 2014.

Currently, the library collection has more than 900,000 volumes including books, journals, and special items. Furthermore, the library&#x27;s collection, in addition to printed materials, also includes access to Polish and foreign databases, online journals and e-books.

=== Laboratories ===
The AGH University has more than 800 laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art apparatus, including the transmission electron microscope Titan Cubed G-2 60-300, devices requiring the so-called clean room conditions, nanotechnology and material nanodiagnostics equipment, a computed tomography scanner to study construction materials, an electron microprobe Jeol SuperProbe JXA-8230 that facilitates the determination of elemental contents from boron to uranium in all kinds of solid substances, mass spectrometers, diffractometers, 3D printers for prototype creation, numerous appliances for environmental tests, microscopes for microstructure parameter analyses and measurements, as well as various types of laboratory installations (including a fully functional production line in the Industry 4.0 Laboratory or a singing Tesla coil in the High Voltage Laboratory). The AGH University has one of the quietest places in Poland – an anechoic chamber, as well as the Experimental Mine, which is unique in Poland and one of the few such research and educational laboratories in Europe, and also serves as a museum.

=== Green areas and an outdoor gallery ===
The green spaces and garden squares of the campus constitute an outdoor gallery. It features, for example, sculptures of Bronisław Chromy, a Krakow artist, sculptures of students from the Faculty of Sculpture of the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow, as well as natural creations – glacial erratics. Moreover, campus premises abound in industrial machines related to the development of technological thought and research activity of respective faculties.

=== AGH University Student Campus ===
The Miasteczko Studenckie AGH, which spans about 13 ha, is an integral part of the university campus and remains the largest student settlement in Poland. The 20 student houses offer more than 7,500 beds to students.

The campus comprises student clubs, a swimming pool with a gym and bowling alley, and sports fields.

Student clubs:

* Academic Cultural Centre, Klub STUDIO – one of the largest concert clubs in Poland
* Klub Zaścianek
* Klub Gwarek
* Klub Filutek

== History ==

=== Efforts to establish the Mining Academy ===

The efforts to establish a Polish mining school in Krakow and to appoint suitable teaching staff began in the second half of the 19th century and intensified when Galicia gained autonomy in 1860. This endeavour involved Polish engineers – miners and metallurgists, Galician representatives, and Krakow authorities. Concentrated diplomatic action was taken in Vienna to win the favour of the Austrian government.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a group of prominent engineers and mining activists, led by engineer Jan Zarański, went to great lengths to obtain approval for establishing a higher education institution in Krakow to educate mining engineers. These efforts were successful, and on 10 July 1912, Krakow authorities received a permit to open an academy.

=== 1913 – institution of the Mining Academy ===

In April 1913, the Ministry of Civil Engineering in Vienna appointed the Organising Committee of the Mining Academy in Krakow, chaired by Professor Józef Morozewicz.

The document that confirmed the establishment of a higher school of mining in Krakow was signed on 31 May 1913, by emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.

The outbreak of World War I made it impossible to inaugurate the first academic year of the newly established academy in October 1914. The minutes from a conference at the President of Krakow, Juliusz Leo, contain a footnote related to the Mining Academy. A magistrate official, probably reorganising documents, wrote an additional note at the bottom of one of them that said: &quot;‘Due to the outbreak of war, the Mining Academy was not opened, the whole matter being postponed to more peaceful times, 21st March 2015.’&quot;

=== 1919 – the opening of the academy ===
When Poland regained its independence in 1918, the Organising Committee of the Mining Academy in Krakow recommenced its work.

On 8 April 1919, the Council of Ministers put forward an official motion to establish and open the Mining Academy in Krakow. On 1 May 1919, the first six professors of the Mining Academy were appointed.

On 20 October 1919, Józef Piłsudski officiated a celebratory inauguration of the Mining Academy in the main hall of the Jagiellonian University.

=== Polish-Soviet War ===

Students of the Mining Academy took active part in the Polish-Soviet war in 1920. These events were described by Professor Antoni Hoborski: &quot;‘our youth submitted to voluntary conscription, which I witnessed; then, on the 19th day of July 1920, they all went to their camps (only 6 were deemed unfit for military service)’&quot;.

=== Development in the interwar period ===
On 15 June 1923, with the participation of the contemporary President of the Republic of Poland, Stanisław Wojciechowski, and numerous representatives of the world of science and mining industry, the cornerstone of the new main building of the academy was laid.

In 1925, the design of the Mining Academy emblem was created. It had the initials B.T. (Bogdan Treter) on it. It was probably approved by the General Assembly of Professors.

From September 1929 to March 1930, the main building was gradually filled with departments and central administration of the academy. In 1935, the building was officially and ceremonially blessed.

The academy has quickly achieved a high-quality level of education, assuming its place among the best mining schools in Europe. Moreover, since its inauguration, the academy has cooperated closely with industry, according to its resources and capabilities, and maintained connections with the Polish economy.

The Main Building of the Mining Academy assumed its final shape shortly before the outbreak of World War II. The construction is a perfect example of academic classicism, in style in the 1920s in Poland, which constitutes a manifestation of the power and might of the reborn Polish state. The façade decoration was complemented by monumental statues of miners and metallurgists. The figures were made in 1935 by the sculptor Jan Raszka. On 24 August 1939, the top of the building was crowned with the statue of Saint Barbara made by Stefan Zbigniewicz.

At its two faculties, the Faculty of Mining and the Faculty of Metallurgy, in the interwar period, the Mining Academy had educated 792 engineers, many of whom later held high positions in Polish industry and higher education.

=== World War II ===

The Nazi German invasion of Poland in September 1939 brought the university to a halt. On 6 September, Krakow was seized by German troops. They began to loot and plunder the university property, and reorganise the Main Building of the Mining Academy to house the Regierung des Generalgouvernements (General Government administration). In 1940, the statue of Saint Barbara was thrown off the top of the main building and shattered to pieces.

==== Sonderaktion Krakau ====

On 6 September 1939, a general assembly of Jagiellonian University professors was called to inform them about the policy of German authorities on science and education. On this day at noon, in room 66 of the JU Collegium Novum, professors and lecturers gathered numerously. The building was surrounded by the Gestapo and the meeting participants were arrested. Among the detainees were also Mining Academy professors who had attended another meeting in the boardroom of the JU Faculty of Philosophy. 183 people were imprisoned, among them professors, associate professors, and assistants from both universities, as well as many other people outside the academic community.

The arrested were detained at the prison at Montelupich Street in Krakow and subsequently transferred to the barracks at Mazowiecka Street. Later, they were transported to a prison in Wrocław and finally to the concentration camp in Sachsenhausen.

The concentration camp took the lives of the following:
* Professor Antoni Hoborski – first Mining Academy rector (1920–1922),
* Professor Władysław Takliński – Mining Academy rector (1933–1939),
* Antoni Meyer, DSc – head of the MA Faculty of Mining Department of Legal Theory (1932–1939).

Others who remained in the camp were Andrzej Bolewski, Stanisław Gołąb, and Julian Kamecki. They were transported to the concentration camp in Dachau and released only in the last quarter of 1940. Releasing the professors was possible due to a united protest action of world scientific communities.

==== Mining Academy employees as victims of the Katyn massacre ====

Among the victims murdered by the NKVD on the territory of the Soviet Union between April and May 1940 were three Mining Academy employees:
* Zygmunt Mitera, DSc – Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Mining (murdered in the so-called Kharkov camp),
* Tadeusz Ramza, Eng – Senior Teaching Assistant at the Faculty of Mining (shot in the back of the head during the liquidation of the prison camp of Polish officers in Starobielsk),
* Augustyn Jelonek – Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Metallurgy (shot in the back of the head during the liquidation of the prison camp of Polish officers in Starobielsk).

Forced by the Germans, but with the consent of the Polish government in London and the Polish Underground State, in 1943, more than a dozen Poles went to Katyn, including the writer Ferdynand Goetel (secretary of the Mining Academy between 1920 and 1925, brother of Professor Walery Goetel). The committees corroborated that the massacre of Polish officers was executed by the Soviets. After the war, Ferdynand Goetel was to the Soviets one of the most inconvenient witnesses of the Katyn massacre.

==== Education during the war ====

Thanks to the generosity and dedication of the Mining Academy employees, the collection of the MA Main Library was safely deposited in the Jagiellonian Library. Academy activities had to go underground, and the governance attempted to reclaim or establish makeshift teaching venues and educational materials.

With the consent of the occupier, in 1940, a State School of Mining, Metallurgy, and Measurement (Staatlische Fachschule für Berg- Hütten- und Vermessungwesen) was established with Polish as the language of instruction. Professor Walery Goetel took the position of the head teacher; other professors from the closed Mining Academy became teachers. Both professors and assistants were also involved in underground education, lecturing, and teaching classes for academic students. During the underground schooling action, 278 examinations and 16 diploma exams took place.

=== After World War II ===

In 1947, by virtue of an important resolution, the academy was renamed Academy of Mining and Metallurgy (Polish: &quot;Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicz&quot;a, &quot;AGH&quot;). Formal approval of this change by the central authorities came only in 1949.

Professor Walery Goetel, who promoted a far-reaching development plan, initiated the expansion of the academy. His plan was carried out and implemented in the following decades.
During the authoritarian times of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic (Polish: &quot;Polska Republika Ludowa&quot;, &quot;PRL&quot;), the academic and educational profile of the academy was adjusted to the needs of industry, and the university itself thrived, as no other higher education institution at that time.

In 1969, the academy received a patron – Stanisław Staszic. It was also when the academy obtained its banner.

On 14 December 1981, the AGH academic community, under the banner of the ‘Solidarity’ Movement, took a stand and protested against suppressing – by introducing martial law – the newly acquired sense of freedom and fellowship. The AGH NSZZ ‘Solidarity’ was an academic organisation, the only one in Krakow and one of three in the country, that organised sit-down strikes in the first days of the martial law.

Since the 1990s, the academy has been developing programmes of study that chart out technological advancement, such as control engineering and robotics, computer science, electronics and telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and mechatronics.

In 1999, the top of the AGH Main Building was once again crowned with a reconstructed statue of Saint Barbara, made by Jan Siek. The figure was blessed on 17 June 1999, by pope John Paul II during his sixth pilgrimage to Poland (5–17 June 1999).

In relation to a debate on the change of the academy name in 2003, it has been decided that the English translation of the name will be: AGH University of Science and Technology. However, there are many documents, books, research papers etc. in English that still use the literal translation of the university name in Polish.

In the academic year 2006–2007, the AGH UST implemented a new Visual Identity System, including a new sign identifying the university.

In 2023, the university Senate decided that the name AGH University of Science and Technology (AGH UST) will be changed into AGH University of Krakow (AGH University).

In the 21st century, the university has experienced extensive expansion. The campus premises have gained more than a dozen new buildings, and numerous existing objects have been modernised.

== University symbols ==

=== Emblem ===
The AGH University emblem shows a stylised eagle with a crown, head turned right, and a shield with Hammer and Pick (symbol of mining), as well as AGH University initials.

The present version of the emblem was designed on the basis of a drawing made in 1925 by Bogdan Treter. The AGH University emblem ought to be used exclusively to promote the history and scientific legacy of the university.

=== Graphic symbol ===
The AGH University graphic symbol is the only sign used for everyday visual identification of the university. It has replaced the AGH University emblem in this role. The ideogram represents a stylised eagle, which is an allusion to the university emblem. In its coloured version, the ideogram has three colours.

=== Colors ===
AGH University colors are green, black and red in reference to the tradition of mining and metallurgy. Green being a symbol of nature, black symbolizing mines, prudence and wisdom and red being a symbol of fire and molten iron.

== Traditions ==

=== Mining Ceremonies ===

&#x27; (English: St. Barbara&#x27;s day) is a mining holiday, deeply embedded in the AGH University tradition, drawing on the customs of old Austrian mining schools, which were transplanted onto the Krakow soil by the university professors. Each year, on 4 December, &#x27; (English: March of the Foxes) – a mining procession parades through the streets of Krakow. ‘Foxes’ are newly admitted students who enter the mining tribe. On this day, in St. Anna&#x27;s Collegiate Church a ceremonial mass is said. The highlight of the celebration is held in the Assembly Hall. Subsequently, in the Main Hall, the traditional &#x27; (English: leather jump) takes place, which consists in jumping over the miner&#x27;s apron (a short leather apron traditionally worn to protect the miners’ clothing as they sat or knelt while working). For first-year mining and geology students, the jump constitutes a rite of acceptance as a miner. The celebration is accompanied by the recurrent Mining Division Student Research Clubs Conference and the International Exhibition and Trade Fair of Minerals, Fossils, and Jewellery. The culmination of the celebration is the annual meeting of the &#x27; (English: guilds).

=== Metallurgy Ceremonies ===

Another remarkable celebration held at the AGH University is the Metallurgist&#x27;s Day. The way in which it is celebrated is very similar to the mining ceremonies. The event takes place annually in May, and in addition to the official ceremonies in the Assembly Hall, the programme includes, among other things, the Metallurgy Division Student Research Clubs Conference and an academic conference. Metallurgical traditions, which are nurtured at the university, include the Metallurgist&#x27;s Vowing ceremony, which takes place in the Main Hall of the AGH University Main Building. Traditionally, the celebration is accompanied by a meeting of academic staff and students during the so-called &quot;&quot; (English: metallurgy tavern).

=== Hoborski Science Days ===

Each year, in October, the AGH University holds Science Holidays – better known as Hoborski Science Days. The event aims to popularise science and its technical applications, simultaneously commemorating the figure of Professor Antoni Hoborski, a prominent Polish mathematician, the first rector of the Mining Academy.

<doc id="1098156" wikidata="Q1288804" url="?curid=1098156" title="Calochortus">
<text>Calochortus is a genus of flowering plants in the lily family. The group includes herbaceous, perennial and bulbous species, all native to North America (primarily the Western United States).

The genus &quot;Calochortus&quot; includes mariposas (or mariposa lilies) with open wedge-shaped petals, globe lilies and fairy lanterns with globe-shaped flowers, and cat&#x27;s ears and star tulips with erect pointed petals. The word &quot;Calochortus&quot; is derived from Greek and means &quot;beautiful grass&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Calochortus&quot; flowers have six tepals. Unlike most other Liliaceae, &quot;Calochortus&quot; tepals are in two series that differ in size and color. The outer three are generally narrower and more sepal-like, while the inner three are larger, usually with bright marks at the base, and are often described as petals. The flowers are borne on a stem that arises from a bulb, generally in the spring or early summer. Flowers can be white, yellow, pink, purple, bluish, or streaked. The insides of the petals are often very &#x27;hairy&#x27;. These hairs, along with the nectaries, are often used in distinguishing species from each other.

;Species 


==Distribution and habitat==
The genus &quot;Calochortus&quot; includes approximately 70 species distributed from southwestern British Columbia, through California and Mexico, to northern Guatemala and eastwards to New Mexico, Nebraska and the Dakotas. &quot;Calochortus&quot; is the most widely dispersed genus of Liliaceae on the North American Pacific Coast. Of these, 28 species are endemic to California.

In 1998, T.B. Patterson conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the genus, dividing it into seven main clades (see Subdivision update below). The study indicated highly localized speciation, so that different floral syndromes were strongly linked to specific habitats, as follows: 
*Mariposas: dry grasslands, open chaparral, semideserts
*Star-tulips: wet meadows
*Cat&#x27;s ears: montane woodlands
*Fairy lanterns: oak woodlands, closed forests.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===
&quot;Calochortus&quot; was first proposed in 1814 by Frederick Pursh to accommodate a specimen—&quot;C. elegans&quot;—received from the Lewis and Clark expedition. In the 1800s, several species were added to the genus; however, much mistakes in naming conventions led to confusion and minimal knowledge gained by the end of the century. 

In 1940, Francis Marion Ownbey wrote a comprehensive monograph on &quot;Calochortus&quot;, referencing morphological evidence, geographical distribution, and his own study of cytological material. Ownbey proposed a treatment dividing &quot;Calochortus&quot; into three sections (later corroborated by J.M. Beal):

# Eucalochortus
#* Ten basic chromosomes and two known cases of tetraploidy
#* Includes subsections Pulchelli, Eleganti, Nudi, Nitidi
# Mariposa
#* Basic chromosome numbers between six and nine
#* Includes subsections Venusti, Macrocarpi, Nuttalliani, Gunnisoniani
# Cyclobothra
#* Nine basic chromosomes
#* Includes subsection Weediani

In 1985, F.N. Rasmussen developed a new treatment splitting &quot;Calochortus&quot; from Liliaceae, moving it into a separate family—Calochortaceae—based on chromosomal evidence, septicidal fruit, and a Polygonum type embryo sac formation. Rasmussen found that the basic chromosome numbers of Calochortus vary between seven and twenty.

=== Subdivision update ===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Thomas B. Patterson and Thomas J. Givnish gathered additional evidence to create a new &quot;Calochortus&quot; treatment, subdividing it into seven sections and providing reasoning behind &quot;Calochortus&quot; being separate from Liliaceae. In 1999, Patterson used cpDNA (specifically rbcL and ndhF sequences) isolated from frozen or silica dried leaf tissue to develop a molecular phylogeny, finding that &quot;Calochortus&quot; should be divided into seven major clades based on geographic location: 

* Bay Area
* Pacific Northwest
* San Diego
* Great Basin- Rocky Mountains
* Coast Ranges- Sierra Nevada
* Southwestern California
* Central Mexico

Patterson also determined at the time that concerted convergence and phylogenetic niche conservatism may have confounded the idea that Calochortaceae (&quot;Calochortus&quot;) and Liliaceae are closely related. In 2002, Patterson and Givnish expanded on these arguments, showing that concerted convergence was demonstrated through independent evolution of characteristics such as bulbs and showy flowers and the distinct differences of these appearing as a result of survival in specific habitats. Regarding phylogenetic niche conservatism, Patterson and Givnish make the argument that this phenomenon is present in the plesiomorphic characteristics of rhizomes, inconspicuous flowers, berries, broad leaves, and reticulate venation.

In 2004, Patterson and Givnish made the shift to lump &quot;Calochortus&quot; within Liliaceae within their paper per the recommendations of Bremer et al. (2003) and Bremer, Chase, and Stevens (1998). Using similar DNA collection techniques to Patterson (1999), Patterson and Givnish developed a more detailed molecular phylogeny, comparing the seven recently determined sections to Ownbey&#x27;s original three and finding that Ownbey&#x27;s Eucalochortus section is monophyletic, Mariposa is paraphyletic, and Cyclobothra is polyphyletic. As a result of their research, Patterson and Givnish (2004) found that the two main factors of &quot;Calochortus&quot; speciation are: 

# Poor dispersal caused by heavy, passively dispersed seeds
# Chromosomal evolution allowing different clades to “double up” and radiate sympatrically without hybridizing

=== Serpentine tolerance ===
Within &quot;Calochortus&quot;, almost one-third of species are characterized by ultramafic (form serpentine soils) habitat preferences or specific edaphic requirements, with several being endemic to their environments. Thus, scientists have used serpentine tolerance in understanding evolutionary relationships within the genus. For instance, Patterson and Givnish (2004) created a serpentine tolerance phylogeny. 18 serpentine tolerant species were found (classified by occurring in whole or in part on serpentine soils) and the largest presence of tolerance was found in the Bay Area and Pacific Northwest clades—areas with unusually high numbers of serpentine rocks at the Earth&#x27;s surface. In addition, Patterson and Givnish (2004) found that 11 out of 18 species displayed only two origins of serpentine tolerance in evolutionary history. 

==Uses==

=== Culinary ===
The bulbs of many species were eaten by Native Americans. These bulbs were eaten raw or gathered in the fall and boiled, and the flower buds when young and fresh. They were eaten by the Mormon settlers between 1853 and 1858 when famine threatened new immigrants in the Great Salt Lake Valley, due to crop failures. The bulbs are a starchy food source similar to a potato tuber.

Native Americans called &quot;Calochortus&quot; &quot;sego&quot;. They used it as food, in ceremonies and as a traditional medicinal plant.

=== Cultivation ===
Some &quot;Calochortus&quot; species are cultivated as ornamental plants by specialty nurseries and botanic gardens to sell. The bulbs are planted for their flowers, in traditional, native plant, and wildlife gardens; in rock gardens; and in potted container gardens for those needing unwatered Summer dormancy.

<doc id="1098157" wikidata="Q769012" url="?curid=1098157" title="Jimmy Calderwood">
<text>James Calderwood (28 February 1955 – 19 January 2025) was a Scottish football player and manager. Calderwood played for Birmingham City and Dutch clubs Sparta Rotterdam, Willem II Tilburg, Roda JC and Heracles Almelo. After retiring as a player, Calderwood stayed in the Netherlands and became a coach, becoming a manager of Willem II Tilburg and NEC Nijmegen.

Calderwood returned to his native Scotland in 1999 to become manager of Dunfermline Athletic, guiding them to the 2004 Scottish Cup Final. Calderwood left Dunfermline that summer to become manager of Aberdeen, a position he held for five seasons. Aberdeen performed relatively well in the SPL under Calderwood and reached the last 32 of the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, but suffered a number of domestic cup defeats by lower league opponents. He then had brief stints with Kilmarnock and Ross County, helping each club retain their league status. Calderwood returned to the Netherlands in March 2012, with Go Ahead Eagles.

In January 2014, Calderwood spent just under a month as manager of De Graafschap before resigning. Calderwood cited the sale of several of De Graafschap&#x27;s key players without adequate replacement as the reason for his resignation from the post. In July 2016, Calderwood was appointed to the board of directors at Cowdenbeath.

In August 2017, Calderwood revealed that he had had earlier-onset dementia for the past two years and was being treated for the condition. He died on 19 January 2025. His funeral procession on 19 February 2025 passed right by Ibrox Park, home of Rangers F.C.

==Playing career==

Born in Govan, Glasgow, Calderwood was raised in the Castlemilk housing scheme in the city. He played in youth teams with Ricky Sbragia who also became a footballer and later a manager, and also played at schoolboy level with future Scotland captain Willie Miller.

He started his professional career with Birmingham City as an apprentice in 1971, making his first team debut against Stoke City in 1972 (Sbragia joined him a year later). He made 159 appearances for the club before spending a couple of months on loan at Cambridge United in 1979 and early 1980 and at Dutch club Sparta Rotterdam from March 1980 to the end of the season. Calderwood chose to reject Birmingham&#x27;s offer of a new contract, and he moved on to another Dutch club, Willem II, for a £50,000 fee. After two years with Willem II and a further six with Roda JC, Calderwood spent a short spell with Heracles Almelo before retiring in 1989.

==Managerial career==

=== Netherlands ===
Calderwood first became a coach in 1991, of amateur club Rietvogels of Almelo. A year later he became an assistant coach of professional club FC Zwolle, before moving in 1993 to Cambuur Leeuwarden. He returned to Willem II Tilburg in 1995, initially as assistant coach before becoming the manager of the club a year later. A year later, he moved to the managerial position at NEC Nijmegen.

=== Dunfermline ===

After a two-year spell with NEC, Scottish First Division side Dunfermline Athletic moved to make him their new manager. Calderwood spent five seasons at East End Park, where he led the club to promotion to the SPL in his first season in charge. He also led them to their highest ever SPL position, finishing fourth in 2003–04. That season the side also reached the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, guaranteeing their return to European competition for the first time in 35 years as opponents Celtic had already earned Champions League qualification.

=== Aberdeen ===
In the summer of 2004 Willie Miller, returning to Pittodrie as director of football, brought Calderwood to Aberdeen to replace Steve Paterson as manager. Calderwood oversaw an improvement in Aberdeen&#x27;s fortunes on the playing field. They narrowly missed out on qualifying for European competition in 2004–05 and 2005–06 but finished the 2006–07 league campaign in third place, ensuring UEFA Cup qualification. However, there was humiliation for his team when they were eliminated from the 2006–07 Scottish League Cup by the amateur club Queen&#x27;s Park.

In December 2007, Calderwood led Aberdeen to the last 32 of European competition for the first time since 1986 with a surprising 4–0 demolition of FC Copenhagen at Pittodrie. With this great achievement, the Dons were rewarded by drawing FC Bayern Munich. Calderwood&#x27;s team drew 2–2 with Bayern at Pittodrie on 14 February 2008, but the Germans pulled off a convincing 5–1 win the following week. Calderwood signed a -year contract to end a month of speculation about his future, along with assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl and coach Sandy Clark.

Calderwood took Aberdeen to the 2007–08 Scottish Cup semi final, where they lost 4–3 to Dumfries First Division side, Queen of the South. This was despite two goals and an assist from Barry Nicholson playing against his hometown club.

The 2008–09 season saw Calderwood come in for some stern criticism following the club&#x27;s poor start to the campaign. The Dons failed to win any of their opening four home matches, and were beaten 4–2 by Kilmarnock in the League Cup. Fans became impatient with some claiming it was time for a fresh start just as the team recovered form and were in the race for third place. On 18 January 2009, Calderwood led Aberdeen to a memorable 4–2 victory over Celtic that propelled Aberdeen to third in the league. However, just three league wins followed in the next 16 and Calderwood left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot; on 24 May 2009, after the team had qualified for a place in the UEFA Europa League with a 2–1 victory over Hibernian.

===Kilmarnock===
Calderwood was appointed manager of Kilmarnock on 14 January 2010, succeeding Jim Jefferies. He agreed to a contract with the club until the end of the 2009–10 season. Calderwood managed to secure Kilmarnock&#x27;s SPL status for another season, but left the club in the summer after disagreeing with chairman Michael Johnston about the player and coaching budgets.

===Ross County===
On 16 February 2011, Calderwood agreed to fill the managerial post at First Division club Ross County until the end of the season.

===Go Ahead Eagles===
Calderwood was appointed coach of Go Ahead Eagles in the Eerste Divisie on 30 March 2012. He left the Deventer club after they were knocked out of the promotion play-offs by FC Den Bosch after the second leg of their double-header on 13 May.

===De Graafschap===
Calderwood was appointed manager of De Graafschap in January 2014. He left the club after less than a month in the job, furious at the sale of two key players before the start of the season. His decision to quit was not well received by the players, with club captain Edwin Linssen saying: &quot;When we were told, we were very depressed. It&#x27;s not good, it&#x27;s a sad day for the club.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
In a 1978 pen picture in &quot;Shoot!&quot; magazine, the then 22-year-old Calderwood named Eddie Gray as his favourite player, Rangers as his favourite team, and Trevor Brooking as the toughest opponent he had faced. His most memorable match was his Birmingham City debut, against Stoke City in November 1972, his &quot;biggest thrill&quot; was being picked to represent his country at under-23 level, and he had been disappointed to be dropped for the 1975 FA Cup semi-finals against Fulham. Apart from his father, he cited former Birmingham coach Willie Bell as having had the greatest influence on his career. Away from football, he enjoyed snooker, golf and badminton and named Neil Diamond and Diana Ross as his favourite singers.

Calderwood died from complications of dementia on 19 January 2025, at the age of 69. His funeral procession one month later was driven past Rangers stadium Ibrox Park.

<text>The Cyprus Mathematical Society (CMS) aims to promote the mathematical education and science. It was founded in 1983. The C.M.S. is a non-profit organization supported by the voluntary work of its members. The C.M.S. counts over 600 members. In order to promote its aims, C.M.S. organizes Mathematical competition between students all over Cyprus, and takes part in international mathematics competitions (BMO, Junior BMO competition, PMWC, IMO). CMS organize a series of mathematics competitions as part of the selection process of the national teams in the international mathematics competitions and the Cyprus Mathematical Olympiad. The new selection process in described below.

== High School (Lyceum) competitions ==

As of 2005, in Cyprus Four provincial competitions are held in November in every district capital. In Lefkosia is called &quot;Iakovos Patatsos&quot;, in Lemesos is called &quot;Andreas Vlamis&quot;, in Larnaka and Ammochostos is called &quot;Petrakis Kyprianou&quot; and in Pafos is called &quot;Andreas Hadjitheoris&quot;. Every grade has different problems. Afterwards ten high-school (Lyceum) students from every grade (1st, 2nd and 3rd grade) of every district are selected.&lt;br&gt;
Total: 4 districts * 3 grades * 10 students = 120 students.

Then a National (Pancyprian) competition is held in December and is called &quot;&quot;Zeno&quot;. Every grade still has different problems. Afterwards ten students from every grade are selected.&lt;br&gt;
Total: 3 grades * 10 students = 30 students.&lt;br&gt;
These student are usually divided into two groups according to the district they come from.

Each group watches about eight to ten four-hour preparation lessons for the olympiad. During the lessons Four Team Selection Tests are held which are considered the four parts of the Selection Competition above 15.5 and are called &quot;Euclides&quot;. All the student have the same test. In each of the competition five students are eliminated. So after the fourth competition the six member of national team for IMO and BMO and the four runners-up are selected.

*In every competition or test there are four problem usually covering geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics (elementary level) and last four hours each.

== Junior high-school (Gymnasium) competitions ==

Four provincial competitions are also held in November in every district capital which have the same name as above. Afterwards 10 junior high-school (Gymnasium) students from every grade (1st, 2nd and 3rd grade) from every district are selected.&lt;br&gt;
Total: 4 districts * 3 grades * 10 students = 120 students.

Then a National (Pancyprian) competition is held in December and is called &quot;Evagoras Pallikaridis&quot;&quot;. Every grade has different problems. Afterwards 10 students from every grade are selected.&lt;br&gt;
Total: 3 grades * 10 students = 30 students.&lt;br&gt;
This student are usually divide into two groups according to the district they come from.

Each group watches about ten to twelve-four hour preparing lessons for the olympiad. During the lessons Four Team Selection Tests are held which are considered the four parts of the Selection Competition under 15.5 and are called &quot;Euclides&quot;. All the student have the same test. In each of the competition 5 students are eliminated. So after the 4th competition the six member of national team for Junior BMO and the four runners-up are selected.

*In every competition or test there are four problem usually covering geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics (elementary level) and last four hours each.

<text>NuCalc, also known as Graphing Calculator, is a computer software tool made by Pacific Tech. It can graph inequalities and vector fields, and functions in two, three, or four dimensions. It supports several different coordinate systems, and can solve equations. It runs on OS X as Graphing Calculator, and on Windows.

==History==
The Graphing Calculator 1.0 software was bundled with all Power Macintosh computers since its introduction in 1994. Having shipped on more than 20 million machines, it is the most familiar version of the program. This version of Graphing Calculator was secretly developed at Apple by Ron Avitzur, an abandoned contractor who felt obligated to complete the project, and their friend and colleague Greg Robbins. NuCalc 1.0 is for 680x0 Macintosh. In 2005, &quot;This American Life&quot; featured Avitzur&#x27;s story in episode 284, &quot;Should I Stay or Should I go?&quot;.

At one time, it was a free download for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X 10.3, and Mac OS X 10.4. However, these may lack some features of 1.0 and may include promotion for the more advanced, commercial version of the software. A Windows version (offered for sale) was renamed NuCalc.

The app has been ported from C++ to SwiftUI.

<text>Michael Peter Staniforth (15 December 1942 – 31 July 1987), born in Selly Oak, Birmingham, was a British stage actor.

==Life==
Staniforth&#x27;s father was a sergeant major in the Army and so Michael&#x27;s childhood was spent with his family in Germany, Egypt and Libya. 

He emigrated to Australia at the age of 21 and two years later landed a role in &quot;South Pacific&quot; at The Menzies Theatre Restaurant in Sydney, where for the next few years he performed in a further 12 musicals, including &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Out Of This World&quot;, followed by a national tour of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. 

He returned to England in late 1969 and first appeared in the West End in &quot;Hair&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre. He also appeared in the &quot;Two Gentlemen Of Verona&quot; (Speed) and &quot;Winnie The Pooh&quot; (Tigger) at the Phoenix Theatre. In 1977 he played the role of Paul in the original British cast of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, returning to the same venue (Theatre Royal, Drury Lane) three years later as the young Tobias in Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;.

Staniforth&#x27;s best-known role was as ghostly jester Timothy Claypole, a mischievous medieval poltergeist, in the long-running BBC children&#x27;s television comedy series &quot;Rentaghost&quot;.

Staniforth played Timothy Claypole from 1976, when the show first aired, until 1984, and was the longest-standing member of the cast. Claypole was a bearded medieval jester, dressed in motley and bells. He caused mayhem for the rest of the &quot;Rentaghost&quot; cast. Danny Birchall at BFI Screenonline noted:
The sheer energy of Michael Staniforth (who also performed the theme tune) as Claypole made it one of the longer-lasting children&#x27;s television series, if not always the most fondly remembered.
Staniforth also composed, played and sang the &quot;Rentaghost&quot; theme music, although he had to re-write it as &quot;concern grew that it was too close to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.&quot;

In 1984, Staniforth had a significant role as CB the Red Caboose in the original line-up in the long-running Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical &quot;Starlight Express&quot;.

Staniforth was gay. He died from an AIDS-related illness on 31 July 1987, aged 44.

<text>The prime minister of New Zealand is the country&#x27;s head of government and the leader of the Cabinet, whose powers and responsibilities are defined by convention. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the governor-general, but by convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the House of Representatives. The prime minister is always a member of parliament.

Originally, prime ministers headed loose coalitions of independents, which were often unstable; since the advent of political parties, the prime minister is usually the leader of the largest party represented in the house. Since 1935, every prime minister has been a member of either the National party or the Labour party, reflecting their domination of New Zealand politics. After the introduction of mixed-member proportional voting in 1996, prime ministers have usually needed to negotiate agreements with smaller parties to maintain a majority in Parliament.

The title of the office was originally &quot;colonial secretary&quot;, which was formally changed to &quot;premier&quot; in 1869. That title remained in use almost exclusively for more than 30 years, until Richard Seddon changed it to &quot;prime minister&quot; during his tenure in the office; he used the title officially at the 1902 Colonial Conference.

Some historians regard James FitzGerald as New Zealand&#x27;s first prime minister, although a more conventional view is that neither he nor his successor (Thomas Forsaith) should properly be given that title, as New Zealand did not yet have responsible government when they served. Most commonly, Henry Sewell, who served during 1856, is regarded as New Zealand&#x27;s first premier. Beginning with Sewell, 42 individuals have so far held the premiership, not including Hugh Watt, who was acting prime minister following the death of Norman Kirk. Eight prime ministers have held the position for more than one period in office. Richard Seddon, prime minister for thirteen years between 1893 and 1906, held the office for the longest term. The youngest prime minister was Edward Stafford, who assumed office at age 37, and the oldest was Walter Nash, who left office at age 78. Three prime ministers have been women, a count equalled by Finland, Lithuania, Poland and the United Kingdom, and only surpassed by Switzerland.

The current prime minister is Christopher Luxon, who assumed office on 27 November 2023.

== List of officeholders ==

<doc id="1098181" wikidata="Q1857411" url="?curid=1098181" title="Ray Guy">
<text>William Ray Guy (December 22, 1949 – November 3, 2022) was an American professional football punter who played for the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). Guy was a first-team All-American selection in 1972 as a senior for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles, and is the only pure punter ever to be drafted in the first round of the NFL draft, when the Raiders selected him with the 23rd overall pick in the 1973 NFL draft. He won three Super Bowls with the Raiders. Guy was elected to both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014. An eight-time All-Pro, Guy is widely considered to be the greatest punter of all time.

With his induction to the Hall of Fame on August 2, 2014, he became the first pure punter to be so honored.

==Early life==
Guy attended Thomson High School in Thomson, Georgia, where he was a four-sport star. Playing quarterback, safety, linebacker, and tailback, aside from kicking and punting duties, Guy led Thomson to the Georgia Class A state football championships in 1967 and 1968. Guy averaged 49.7 yards per punt in 1968. Playing basketball, Guy scored 39 points in a Thomson basketball game the day after the 1968 state championship football game, with no practice. In baseball, Guy pitched a 15-inning scoreless game for Thomson in the state playoff semifinals in 1969. He was also a member of the track team.

==College career==
Guy was both a punter and a placekicker at the University of Southern Mississippi, once kicking a then-NCAA record 61-yard field goal in a snowstorm during a game in Utah. In 1972, he kicked a 93-yard punt in a game against the University of Mississippi. He led the nation with an average of 46.2 yards per punt, earning him first-team All-American honors from the Football Writers Association of America. After his senior season, Guy was named most valuable player of the 1972 Chicago College All-Star Game, in which an all-star team of college seniors played the current Super Bowl champion. His career average of 44.7 yards per punt is a school record. He was also a starting safety at Southern Miss; during his senior season, he set a single-season school record with eight interceptions and was named an All-American defensive back by the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

Guy also played baseball at Southern Miss, striking out 266 in 200 innings and pitching a no-hitter.

==Professional career==
Guy was the first punter ever to be selected in the first round in the NFL draft, when the Oakland Raiders selected him with the 23rd overall pick of the 1973 draft.

In his career as a punter, Guy played his entire career with the Raiders and was selected to seven Pro Bowl teams, including six in a row from 1973 to 1978. He was named as the punter on the NFL&#x27;s 75th and 100th anniversary teams. His trademark was kicking punts that stayed in the air for long periods of time. His punts frequently left opposing offenses pinned deep in their end of the field; by the time opposing punt returners fielded a Guy punt, the Raiders had the field covered so well that a return was impossible. Pro Football Hall of Fame historian Joe Horrigan once said of Guy, &quot;He&#x27;s the first punter you could look at and say: &#x27;He won games.&#x27;&quot;

In Super Bowl XVIII, Guy punted seven times for 299 yards (42.7 average), with 244 net yards (34.8 average). Five of his punts pinned the Washington Redskins inside their own 20. Due in part to his effective punting, the Los Angeles Raiders easily won the game, 38–9.

After a 1977 game against Houston, Oilers coach Bum Phillips accused Guy of using footballs illegally inflated with helium. Houston returner Billy Johnson stated that he had &quot;never seen anyone hang kickoffs like Guy did&quot;, and that the ball was &quot;hanging up there too long&quot;. Additionally, the Raiders had used a new ball for every punt, adding to the Oilers&#x27; suspicions. Phillips said after the game that he would send the ball to Rice University for testing. Guy punted three times for 107 yards in the game, significantly less than his career average.

During his career, Guy was also the Raiders&#x27; emergency quarterback. He also handled kickoffs in the first five years of his career.

In his 14-year career, Guy: 
* Played in 207 consecutive games
* Punted 1,049 times for 44,493 yards, averaging 42.4 yards per punt, with a 33.8 net yards average
* Had 210 punts inside the 20-yard line (not counting his first 3 seasons, when the NFL did not keep track of this stat), with just 128 touchbacks
* Led the NFL in gross yards per punt three times
* Had a streak of 619 consecutive punts before having one blocked
* Has a record of 111 career punts in postseason games

===Hall of Fame===
Guy was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2014 on August 2, 2014. For many years before his induction, he was considered one of the most worthy players who had not yet been selected for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the first punter enshrined in the Hall of Fame, and as of 2024, is still the only player at his position in the Hall. In his enshrinement speech, he proudly proclaimed, &quot;Now the Hall of Fame has a complete team.&quot;

Guy was inducted into both the Mississippi and Georgia Sports Halls of Fame, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, the National High School Sports Hall of Fame, and the College Football Hall of Fame.

==NFL career statistics==

===Postseason===
==Ray Guy Award==
In 2000, the Greater Augusta Sports Council instituted the Ray Guy Award, to be awarded to the nation&#x27;s best collegiate punter.

==Pro kicking camps==
In 2005, Guy helped organize and participated in two-day kicking camps, held throughout the United States, for high school punters, placekickers, and long snappers.

==Personal life and death==
Guy was married to Beverly Guy. The couple had two children, Ryan and Amber.

In 2011, Guy filed for bankruptcy and auctioned his three Super Bowl rings to help pay his debts. The auction of the rings brought in $96,216, exceeding the upper estimate of $90,000.

After a lengthy illness, Guy died on November 3, 2022, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, at age 72. The cause was advanced-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

<doc id="1098211" wikidata="Q7231645" url="?curid=1098211" title="Porter Ranch, Los Angeles">
<text>Porter Ranch is a suburban neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles, in the northwest portion of the San Fernando Valley.

==History==
Porter Ranch community started as a housing tract in the community of Northridge. This was along San Fernando Mission Blvd west of Reseda Blvd circa 1960–1963. Almost no homes were north of Rinaldi Street until the area was annexed by the City of Los Angeles in 1965. These homes were only accessible via Tampa. Approximately 50 homes of the original tract was destroyed north of San Fernando Mission Blvd to build the 118 freeway. 

In the 1970/1971 &quot;shake and bake&quot; three merging fires from Indian Dunes to the Ocean in Malibu, surrounding Simi Valley. The fall 1970 fire crossed Rinaldi west of Reseda Blvd. The largest hill just northeast of Reseda/Rinaldi was thereafter called &quot;cherry hill&quot; as it glowed like a cherry as its tall grasses burned. 
Undeveloped areas south of Rinaldi were substantially feral orange groves, north of Rinaldi was all grasslands. Kids would ride dirt bikes and motorcycles on the many trails in the grasslands and orange groves. Popular with the kids was &quot;the secret of the three trees&quot; visible on top of Oat Mountain. Kids would leave from Rinaldi hiking to the &quot;three trees&quot;, the secret was a fourth tree behind out of sight. It was not unusual to have teen parties complete with rock band (using a generator) in the canyon just west of Tampa Ave.

The new home construction that was completed in the Porter Ranch area in the 1990s–2000s, including the Renaissance Summit development, was mired in controversy and Los Angeles politics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This largely undeveloped area on the very edge of the San Fernando Valley slated for a master-planned $2 billion real estate and commercial development was opposed by the &quot;slow growth&quot; movement, which was gaining traction through a combination of ballot initiatives and court cases along with growing environmental concerns as L.A. at the time was experiencing multiple environmental and infrastructure problems related to the previous decades rapid expansion, in terms of air quality, sewage capacity, and flood control. More locally, this combined with the more &quot;nimby&quot; type sentiment of existing and nearby residents of the Porter Ranch area who feared the increased traffic that would be brought by the planned building of an area commercial complex to service the new homes being built. Developments were also criticized for destroying the natural beauty of the brush and wild areas that inhabited the space before the houses were built.

However, Shapell Homes, a company founded by Nathan Shapell, a major Los Angeles builder, brought together powerful Los Angeles political figures to support the new home building.

===Aliso Canyon Bridge===
In the late 80s, there was an attempt to connect Sesnon Boulevard, the road that flanks the north side of the neighborhood, to its counterpart across the Aliso Canyon, also named Sesnon, via a bridge to be named simply, the &quot;Aliso Canyon Bridge&quot;. This plan never came to fruition due to demonstrations from the residents of Porter Ranch, the primary opponents of the bridge, who believed that connecting the road to the neighborhood across the canyon would bring &quot;crime...drag racing, and drug dealing&quot;. Residents were also afraid of Sesnon becoming &quot;a [highway] 118 alternate route&quot;, which would &quot;send many cars through Porter Ranch&quot;.

Proponents of the bridge said that there was a &quot;critical need&quot; to build a bridge because &quot;the city of Los Angeles has installed heavy-duty guard rails to stop any vehicle that is out of control as it moves east at Beaufait. There is a much smaller rail 200 feet farther east...however, the first guard rail is usually partially broken because of out-of-control vehicles hitting it. Before it can be repaired, there is almost no protection to prevent a vehicle from falling into Aliso Canyon. Additionally, if a vehicle heading west on Sesnon becomes lost, there is no barrier to prevent it from falling into this deep canyon.&quot; Despite the proponents&#x27; argument about the severity of the situation, the bridge was never built.

There is still evidence of the bridge seen from Sesnon heading east towards the canyon, the road (which is now closed off behind multiple guard rails) is visible heading towards the canyon just short of the bridge, and the counterpart is still visible on the west-bound side.
=== Aliso Canyon oil well fire===
A company of Texas oil well firefighters, headed by the legendary Paul “Red” Adair, came to Oat Mountain and stopped a 1968 blaze after six days.

===Gas blowout===

On October 23, 2015, Southern California Gas Company workers discovered a leak in one of the over 110 wells at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, about one mile north of homes in Porter Ranch. The gas blowout began spewing 110,000 pounds of methane per hour. The blowout involved gas stored under pressure in an underground reservoir; the stored gas included mercaptan (tert-Butylthiol), an odorant added to the odorless natural gas to produce a &quot;rotten egg&quot; smell for safety. The California Air Resources Board estimated that the leak increased California&#x27;s methane gas emissions by 25%.

By order of the Los Angeles County Dept of Health, the company relocated thousands of families from the Porter Ranch area; the Federal Aviation Administration established a temporary flight restriction over the leak site until March 2016. On December 15, the county of Los Angeles declared a state of emergency, and two days later it approved a plan to close two schools in the area. Officials estimated that the leak would take months to repair.

On January 11, 2016 Mitchell Englander, the LA City Councilman representing Porter Ranch, said &quot;Most people weren&#x27;t aware that one of the largest gas storage facilities in the United States was in their backyard. There was, from what we&#x27;re hearing, no disclosure when they bought their homes.&quot;

On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged.

On March 12, 2016, Los Angeles County Public Health Department officials say its test of dust in Porter Ranch homes turned up the presence of metals, including barium, that could have caused the kinds of health symptoms some residents have reported experiencing even after the big gas blowout was plugged.

===Fires and other major disasters===
=== Clampette fire===
Sept. 25, 1970 this fire made a one-day 20 mile run to the sea in Malibu from Newhall pass. This fire was the most destructive to date both in loss of property and life. One fatality was in Porter Ranch; there were four deaths total. The Porter Ranch death occurred as a homeowner tried to drive up Tampa through the flames to get to his family at the family home above the ridge (near Sesnon). Note that Tampa was abutted by brush on both sides north of Rinadi until you pass the ridge. It merged with two other fires. This event was part one of the event nicknamed &quot;Shake and Bake&quot;, a combination of wildfire and earthquake. The fire burned along Rinaldi, crossing Rinadi just west of Reseda Blvd. A hill just northeast of Reseda/Renadi was named Cherry Hill after its grasses caused the hill to glow like a cherry. 

===1971 Sylmar quake===
This quake had a major impact on Porter Ranch, on the northwest portion along San Fernando Mission Blvd pools were half emptied, many block walls fell over, the area was without running water for a couple of weeks. Many of the homes floor joists were not bolted to the pylons underneath, causing remediation. A major aftershock was on a fault in Porter Ranch. Note: there were no issues with the Aliso Cyn oil field.

=== 1988 brush fire ===
About 5:00 am a brush fire propelled by 70 mph Santa Anna winds crossed Aliso Creek and destroyed 13 homes and damaged 23 mostly on Beaufait Avenue. The use of wood roof shingles was blamed for the enhanced level of destruction of the fire. Many residents fended off flames on their house roofs with garden hoses. The fire consumed 3,000 acres and $10 million (1988) in damages.

===2019 wildfire===
On October 10, 2019, the Saddleridge Fire broke out in the nearby community of Sylmar due to an electrical power line short circuit. Despite efforts to control the fire, the blaze spread to Porter Ranch within a few hours, forcing the entire community to evacuate while burning some of the homes in the eastern part of the neighborhood. During these fires the skies were gray with ashes falling from the sky, and schools were closed for a few days due to the poor air quality and floating debris. 

==Geography==
The neighborhood is bounded by Brown&#x27;s Canyon/Chatsworth on the south and west, Northridge on the south, and Granada Hills on the northeast and east. The Santa Susana Mountains, which separate the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, lie to the north. The principal thoroughfares are Mason Ave., Corbin Ave., Porter Ranch Drive, Tampa Ave. and Reseda Blvd., running north–south, and Sesnon Blvd., Rinaldi St. and the Ronald Reagan Freeway (State Route 118), running east and west.

Porter Ranch is in the hilly northwestern tip of the San Fernando Valley, where, according to a 2008 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, it was a &quot;calm outpost of Los Angeles&quot; that attracted residents &quot;seeking sanctuary from the urban hubbub.&quot; It was noted that the neighborhood had &quot;some of the cleanest air in the Valley year-around—some of which is attributable to winds that sweep through the community regularly.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;those same winds, which have been clocked at 70 mph, take down trees and holiday lights.&quot; * Renaissance Summit is a neighborhood at the highest point of Porter Ranch.

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census in 2000, the population was 24,923. Based on the Los Angeles Department of City Planning estimates, the population was 30,571 in 2008.

<text>Jai Telangana Party, is a defunct political party in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh founded by P. Indra Reddy. JTP existed around 1998 and was part of the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led &quot;Jan Morcha&quot; (People&#x27;s Front) in the 1998 elections. JTP worked for a separate Telangana state to be carved out of Andhra Pradesh.

P. Indra Reddy, had been the Home Minister of AP in the Telugu Desam Party cabinet. When TDP split after Chandrababu Naidu&#x27;s internal coup, Reddy sided with Lakshmi Parvathi and her parallel TDP, NTR Telugu Desam Party (Lakshmi Parvathi). He later left NTRTDP(LP) to form JTP. After the 1998 elections, he merged his JTP with Indian National Congress.

In the 1999 elections to the AP assembly, Reddy was elected on a Congress ticket. Reddy died in a car accident in 2000.

<doc id="1098223" wikidata="Q111699632" url="?curid=1098223" title="Black Week">
<text>Black Week refers to the week of Sunday 10 December – Sunday 17 December 1899 during the Second Boer War, when the British Army suffered three devastating defeats by the Boer Republics at the battles of Stormberg on Sunday 10 December, Magersfontein on Monday 11 December and Colenso on Friday 15 December 1899. In total, 2,776 British soldiers were killed, wounded and captured during this period. 

The events were an eye opener for the government and troops, who had thought that the war could be won very easily.
British units were armed with then-modern magazine-fed small arms, the .303 caliber Lee–Enfield and Lee–Metford, and breech-loading field artillery. Boers were armed with the 7mm 1893 Mauser rifle, and fielded German-built breech-loading field artillery. The British, however, were accustomed to fighting tribal wars with tactics more suited to the Napoleonic era, and had no tactical doctrine in place to fight against a foe also armed with the same modern weapons, and suffered accordingly.

With new, modernized troops came new tactics; only a few months after Black Week, one of the main British cavalry divisions led a flanking march that ended with a victory. Besides equipping the cavalry with rapid-firing rifles instead of lances, the new British military doctrine also started using artillery as a defensive unit of the army, and saw innovation in the use of machine guns.

These new volunteers served as a &quot;new face, untainted by defeat and accusations of defeatism…to breathe life back into the campaigns and restore hope at home.&quot; Other changes enacted by the British immediately following the Black Week disaster were the mobilization of two more divisions, the calling up of the army reserves, raising a force of mounted infantry for better mobility, and most importantly by sending volunteers from home overseas which added more than one hundred thousand additional troops by the end of the war.

==Political situation==
During Black Week, the British War Office assumed the leading role while the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain stepped back in the cabinet and the Boer War raged on. The reverses and humiliations for the Army hit the London government hard. Chamberlain was eclipsed in Cabinet during December 1899. Ironically Chamberlain had initially been offered the War Office by Lord Salisbury when the government was formed in 1895; had he accepted he would have been at the War Office dealing with the difficulties in the Cape.

Arthur Balfour was acting Prime Minister, and Lord Lansdowne, Secretary for War. Lord Salisbury, grieving at Hatfield for his dead wife, was incapacitated. After Lord Roberts&#x27; victories in the first half of 1900 Chamberlain came to be hailed as a great statesman, in part filling the gap left by the gradual retirement of Lord Salisbury, the former titan of foreign policy. Chamberlain wanted a tolerant, liberal, civilized Empire, and a generous reconstruction of South Africa.

==Military situations==

Lord Methuen was on the march to Kimberley, only 25 miles away. Unscreened from the Boer&#x27;s trenches in the town, the mounted force lost 500 men. But they managed to wheel round to cross the Modder River by nightfall. There he rested from 1 to 7 December, using the river for refreshment. They fully expected Redvers Buller to simultaneously march on Ladysmith in north Natal. These blows they hoped would end the war by Christmas. By Lord Milner&#x27;s assessment conveyed to London, 70,000 troops would be needed to complete the business. Milner&#x27;s concern over losses mitigating success on the field had caused a rethink of the situation in the Transvaal.

...If we had known all we do now, I suppose that we should have taken up a position probably at Colenso and left all the northern part of Natal undefended. We ought also probably to have abandoned Mafeking. One serious deficiency was the low velocity artillery which shot less far than the Boers&#x27; excellent guns.

Milner wrote:.

I dare not speculate on the further progress of the war. The Boers seem to have fought with the greatest courage and determination, and I do not gather that they have lost their power as marksmen.

On Monday 11 December, General Gatacre&#x27;s night attack into strong Boer defences at Stormberg had ended in failure. The enemy had modern rifles, accurate artillery, bandoliers for all, and proven horse commandos. Ganache lost two guns, and 700 men, of whom 500 were prisoners. The senior officers had left them behind. But as usual the Boers did not bother to pursue.

On the Modder River, Methuen&#x27;s division of 15,000 frontline troops ran into heavily dug-in Boers on the Magersfontein Heights. The British artillery barrage warned the Boer of the impending assault, led by the Highland Brigade in the monsoon rains in the darkness. At dawn the British were caught by a murderous cross-fire. Major-General Wauchope became a high-ranking casualty. The British casualties were 1000 men to the Boers&#x27; 250. The defeat delayed the relief of Kimberley.

In Natal, Buller was already pessimistic about the coming battle, although in England they only knew his great reputation. On Friday, December 15, he tried to cross the river. A sortie from Ladysmith might have taken the Boer pickets on Hlangwane Hill, but its significance was overlooked. The British lost 1100 men and ten artillery guns. A humiliating retreat was ordered at nightfall although half the army had not yet engaged the enemy. Lord Roberts&#x27; son was killed. Buller, at his wits end, advised Ladysmith to surrender, but Sir George White pledged to fight on.

Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman declared from Aberdeen on December 19,
The gravity of the situation, the formidable character of the campaign as now disclosed ...these furnish no ground for doubt or for despondency... We have a united people in this country, and in every part of the Empire, and with these forces on our side moral and material success is certain... Mr Chamberlain is largely responsible for this war.

==Consequences of the defeats==
The British government drastically changed their mindset after the Black Week disaster to the realization that the Boer war would not be an easy victory or won by Christmas. They undertook many changes in the military including military personnel, better mobilization, and better modernization in order to match and then surpass the Boer troops. Many different opinions arose in the United Kingdom. Although there were many doubters who criticized the overall justice of the British cause, the patriots who would end up volunteering, fighting, and winning this conflict were the majority. Following Black Week, the government called &quot;for able-bodied men willing to abandon their homes and families and risk their lives to serve their country.&quot; Even with this dangerous task, many still volunteered either for the regular army or for shorter enlistments.

Buller&#x27;s decisions at Ladysmith caused him to be sacked and replaced with Lord Roberts. It was the end of a career for the man the press dubbed &quot;Sir Reverse&quot; Buller.

Another consequence was the recruitment within months of 30,863 new troops from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These were ordered by the Imperial Conference held in 1902. 8400 Canadians volunteered, of which 600 Horse were raised by Lord Strathcona in British Columbia.

Of the Australians, 6208 came from New South Wales, 3897 from Victoria, 2903 from Queensland, 1494 from South Australia, 1165 from Western Australia, 796 from Tasmania. About 6000 from New Zealand. The Canadians were eager horsemen, and when the matter was settled on the day after Colenso, the necessity of cavalry doctrine was acknowledged. Since Black Week large numbers of Australians were encamped awaiting departure. The day after Buller&#x27;s defeat Premier of New Zealand Richard Seddon telegrammed Chamberlain declaring how they would be delighted to help.

<doc id="1098226" wikidata="Q10370831" url="?curid=1098226" title="Sewell's Point">
<text>Sewells Point is a peninsula of land in the independent city of Norfolk, Virginia in the United States, located at the mouth of the salt-water port of Hampton Roads. Sewells Point is bordered by water on three sides, with Willoughby Bay to the north, Hampton Roads to the west, and the Lafayette River to the south. It is the site of Naval Station Norfolk.

== Origins and variations of name ==
The area was originally named in the 17th century after Henry Sewell, an Englishman who arrived in Jamestown, Virginia aboard the George in 1619.

Later, variations in spelling were used, such as Sowells Point, Seawells Point, and Sewalls Point. The common spelling today is Sewells Point.

== First church in Norfolk ==

About 1637, the Elizabeth River Parish was created. The first Anglican church of Elizabeth River Parish was erected between 1638 and 1640 &quot;at Mr. Seawell&#x27;s Pointe,&quot; with assistance of Thomas Willoughby. The first recorded minister was the Reverend John Wilson. The second church to be located in the area now known as South Hampton Roads (the first being St Lukes in Smithfield), it stood somewhere within the present western limits of the US Naval Station Norfolk. According to old court records, the Episcopal churches in Norfolk are directly descended from it.

== Local government – Shire to County to City – A Virginia tradition ==

Sewells Point is an area of land, most notable because of its prominence along the eastern shore of the harbor of Hampton Roads. Never declared a town or city, Sewells Point is more correctly described as a geographical area. The listing of political entities which have constituted the local government at Sewells Point is complex, but typical of many communities in the state of Virginia dating back to the colonial period.

During the 17th century, shortly after establishment of Jamestown in 1607, English settlers and explorers began settling the areas adjacent to Hampton Roads. By 1634, the English colony of Virginia consisted of eight shires or counties with a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Sewells Point was a part of Elizabeth River Shire.

In 1636, the southern portion of Elizabeth River Shire became New Norfolk County, and was divided in 1637 into Upper and Lower Norfolk Counties. In 1691 Lower Norfolk County was in turn divided to form Norfolk County and Princess Anne County.

Sewells Point was to remain located in Norfolk County for over 225 years, until the independent City of Norfolk annexed the area in 1923. (Virginia has had an independent city political subdivision since 1871). The City of South Norfolk and Norfolk County merged to form the new independent city of Chesapeake in 1963.

== Boundaries determined by weather ==
Although Hampton Roads represents a sheltered area from the tempests of both the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, the area&#x27;s shorelines change with extreme weather. At one time, apparently since English settlement began at Jamestown in 1607, Willoughby Bay did not border Sewells Point to the north, since it didn&#x27;t even exist yet.

The area known as Willoughby takes its name from Thomas Willoughby, who came to Virginia in 1610 and received a land grant around 1625. Willoughby&#x27;s son, Thomas II, was living there in the 1660s. According to local legend, his wife awoke one morning following a terrific storm (possibly the &quot;Harry Cane&quot; of 1667) to see a point of land in front her home, where there had been only water the night before. The Willoughby family, it is said, were quick to apply for an addendum to the original land grant, giving them ownership of the &quot;new&quot; property.

Severe storms and hurricanes would continue to transform the contour of the coast, and the Willoughby holdings, for more than a century. Although official records of Hampton Roads weather go back only to 1871 when the National Weather Service office was established in downtown Norfolk, records of earlier storms have been located in ships&#x27; logs, newspaper accounts, history books and writings of early settlers.

Residents of coastal Virginia in the colonial period (1607–1776) were very much aware of the weather. To people who lived near the water and derived much of their livelihood from the sea, a tropical storm was a noteworthy event. During a hurricane in 1749, the Chesapeake Bay rose above normal, sand spit was washed up at Sewells Point. With the help of the Great Coastal Hurricane of 1806, Willoughby Spit was formed. The area of water now located between Sewells Point and Willoughby Spit became known as Willoughby Bay.

== A strategic Civil War location ==

Sewells Point&#x27;s location at the mouth of Hampton Roads proved to be a strategic location during the early portion of the Civil War.

=== Battle of Sewells Point ===
The first skirmish in Virginia, the little-known Battle of Sewells Point, was fought on May 18–19, 1861, on ground now occupied by the US Naval Station Norfolk. The events leading up to the initial engagement on Virginia soil had moved with whirlwind rapidity.

==== Events leading onto the Battle ====
On December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union. Four months later, on April 12, 1861, troops of that state opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston&#x27;s harbor. Five days later, Virginia became the eighth Southern state to withdraw from the Union, and join the newly formed Confederacy.

A few weeks later that spring, US General-in-Chief Winfield Scott proposed to President Lincoln a plan to bring the states back into the Union: cut the Confederacy off from the rest of the world instead of attacking its army in Virginia.

His plan was to blockade the Confederacy&#x27;s coastline and control the Mississippi River valley with gunboats. Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern seaboard from the South Carolina line to the Rio Grande on April 19 and on April 27 extended it to include the North Carolina and Virginia coasts. On April 20, the Union Navy burned and evacuated the Norfolk Navy Yard, destroying nine ships in the process, leaving only Fort Monroe at Old Point Comfort as the last bastion of the United States in Tidewater Virginia.

Occupation of Norfolk gave the Confederacy its only major shipyard and thousands of heavy guns, but they held it for only one year. CS Brigadier General Walter Gwynn, who commanded the Confederate defenses around Norfolk, erected batteries at Sewells Point, both to protect Norfolk and to control Hampton Roads.

The Union dispatched a fleet to Hampton Roads to enforce the blockade, and on May 18–19 Federal gunboats exchanged fire with the batteries at Sewells Point, resulting in little damage to either side.

==== The Battle Itself ====
Stewart&#x27;s &quot;History of Norfolk County, Virginia&quot; (1902), contains a detailed account of the Battle of Sewells Point that took place one month later.


There were no fatalities on either side. The only person wounded was a Confederate private who was struck by a fragment of a bursting shell. Subsequently, the Sewells Point batteries were under fire many times, but they were never silenced or captured in combat. A long-range rifled Sawyer gun of 24-pounder bore, firing 42-pound projectiles, was mounted at Fort Calhoun and shelled Sewells Point circa August 1861. Later, when Confederate forces evacuated Norfolk on May 10, 1862, the batteries were abandoned.

=== Battle of Hampton Roads ===

The famous Battle of Hampton Roads took place off Sewells Point in Hampton Roads on March 8–9, 1862.

USS &quot;Monitor&quot; of the Union Navy faced CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; of the Confederate States Navy.

The battle, which was inconclusive, is chiefly significant in naval history as the first battle between two powered, ironclad warships.

=== Abraham Lincoln and the bombardment of Sewells Point ===
On May 5, 1862, President Lincoln, with his Cabinet Secretaries Stanton and Chase on board, proceeded to Hampton Roads on steamer &quot;Miami&quot; to personally direct the stalled Peninsular Campaign. The following day, Lincoln directed gunboat operations in the James River and the bombardment of Sewells Point by the blockading squadron in the five days he acted as Commander-in-Chief in the field.

On May 8, 1862, &quot;Monitor&quot;, &quot;Dacotah&quot;, &quot;Naugatuck&quot;, &quot;Seminole&quot;, and &quot;Susquehanna&quot; by direction of the President &quot;-shelled Confederate batteries at Sewells Point, Virginia, as Flag Officer L. M. Goldsborough reported, &quot;mainly with the view of ascertaining the practicability of landing a body of troops thereabouts&quot; to move on Norfolk. Whatever rumors President Lincoln had received about Confederates abandoning Norfolk were now confirmed; a tug deserted and brought news that the evacuation was well underway and that CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, with her accompanying small gunboats, planned to proceed up the James River or York River.

It was planned that when the &quot;Virginia&quot; came out, as she had on the 7th, the Union fleet would retire with the &quot;Monitor&quot; in the rear hoping to draw the powerful but under-engined warship into deep water where she might be rammed by high speed steamers. The bombardment uncovered reduced but still considerable strength at Sewells Point. The &quot;Virginia&quot; came out but not far enough to be rammed.

Two days later, President Lincoln, still acting as Commander-in-Chief, directed Flag Officer Goldsborough: &quot;If you have tolerable confidence that you can successfully contend with the &quot;Merrimac&quot; [Lincoln and the North used the ships&#x27; former name] without the help of the &quot;Galena&quot; and two accompanying gunboats, send the &quot;Galena&quot; and two gunboats up the James River at once to support General McClellan.&quot; This division power afloat by the President silenced two shore batteries and forced gunboats CSS &quot;Jamestown&quot; and CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; to return up the James River.

On May 9, 1862, President Lincoln himself, after talking to pilots and studying charts, reconnoitered to the eastward of Sewells Point and found a suitably unfortified landing site near Willoughby Point. The troops embarked in transports that night. The next morning they landed near the site selected by the President. The latter, still afloat, from his &quot;command ship&quot; &quot;Miami&quot; ordered the &quot;Monitor&quot; to reconnoiter Sewells Point to learn if the batteries were still manned. When he found the works abandoned, President Lincoln ordered Major General Wool&#x27;s troops to march on Norfolk, where they arrived late on the afternoon of the 10th.

On May 10, 1862, Norfolk Navy Yard was set afire before being evacuated by Confederate forces in a general withdrawal up the peninsula to defend Richmond. Union troops crossed Hampton Roads from Fort Monroe, landed at Ocean View, and captured Norfolk. With the entire area back under Union control, the isolated batteries at Sewells Point lost their importance and were abandoned. For the remainder of the 19th century, the area was largely undeveloped and sparsely populated.

== Sewells Point in the 20th century ==
Early in the 20th century, two developments at Sewells Point would have a long-lasting effect on its role in US history. Each laid the groundwork for founding of what was to become the world&#x27;s largest naval base.

The first could be described as a civilian battle, one of competition, between the growing railroad and industrial powers. The other had its beginning as a civilian celebration. These were the building of the Virginian Railway and the Jamestown Exposition.

=== Building the Virginian Railway ===
In the mid-1890s, William N. Page, a civil engineer who had previously worked building the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) had a dream. He knew of rich untapped bituminous coal fields lying between the New River Valley and the lower Guyandotte River in southern West Virginia in an area not yet reached by the C&amp;O and its major competitor, the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W).

While the bigger railroads which were busy developing nearby areas and shipping coal via rail to Hampton Roads, he formed a plan. To take advantage of the undeveloped coal lands, Page enlisted several friends as investors to help purchase the land. In 1898, he acquired a small logging railroad, and converted and expanded it to become the intrastate (within West Virginia only) Deepwater Railway. The new short-line railroad planned to connect with the existing lines of the C&amp;O along the Kanawha River at Deepwater and the N&amp;W at Matoaka.

As Page developed his Deepwater Railway, he ran into a wall in negotiating to make connections and share favorable rates with either of the larger railroads. It was later revealed that the leaders of both the C&amp;O and the N&amp;W considered the territory to be potentially theirs for future growth. They secretly agreed to refuse to negotiate with Page and his upstart Deepwater Railway.

Page didn&#x27;t give up as apparently was anticipated. Instead, he stubbornly continued building his Deepwater Railroad, to the increasing puzzlement of the two big railroads. They were unaware that one of Page&#x27;s investors, who were silent partners in the venture, was financier and industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a millionaire who had made his initial fortune as one of the key men with the Standard Oil Trust. Rogers wasn&#x27;t about to have the investment foiled by the big railroads. Instead, he and Page set about secretly planning and securing their own route out of the mountains, &quot;all the way east across Virginia to Hampton Roads!&quot;

A separate company, the Tidewater Railway, was formed in Virginia for the portion to be in that state. Both planning and land acquisition were done largely in secret. One group of 35 surveyors posing as fishermen (on a Sunday in February) mapped out a crossing of the New River at Glen Lyn, Virginia, as well as the adjacent portion of the line from West Virginia through Narrows, Virginia. The new line essentially followed the valley of the Roanoke River through the Blue Ridge Mountains, and then was to run almost due east to the Hampton Roads area.

Deals were quietly struck with the various communities all along the way. Among these was Norfolk, the home-turf for the established Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and its coal pier at Lambert&#x27;s Point. Access to Hampton Roads frontage with enough adjoining land to build a new coal pier was crucial to the whole scheme. Undeveloped land was located at Sewells Point where the Page-Rogers interests purchased of frontage on Hampton Roads, and adjoining land. To facilitate building of the new railroad, Norfolk provided a right-of-way extending virtually completely around the city to reach Sewells Point.

With their land and route secured, in 1905, Page (with Rogers&#x27; identity still not revealed) began building the rest of the new railroad. By the time the larger railroads finally realized what was happening, their new competitor could not be successfully blocked. Rogers&#x27; identity and backing were finally disclosed more than a year later. Early in 1907, the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways, still under construction, were combined to become the Virginian Railway (VGN).
About the same time, the Norfolk portion of the new Virginian Railway tracks had been completed. This proved just in time to serve the Jamestown Exposition, which was held on land just north of the VGN coal pier site at Sewells Point, which opened in the spring of 1907.

By using construction techniques not available when the larger railroads had been built about 25 years earlier, and paying for work with Rogers&#x27; own personal fortune, the new Virginian Railway was built to the highest standards. An engineering marvel of the day, the final spike in the VGN was driven on January 29, 1909.

In April 1909, Rogers was feted at Norfolk in celebration of the completion his new &quot;Mountains to the Sea&quot; railroad. He toured the railway&#x27;s new $2.5 million coal pier at Sewells Point and Mark Twain spoke at a grand Norfolk banquet.

The Virginian Railway and its terminal location at Sewells Point played an important role in 20th-century US naval history. Located immediately adjacent to the former Exposition grounds (which became an important Navy facility beginning in 1917) the VGN transported the high quality smokeless bituminous coal favored by the US Navy for its ships.

When the VGN was merged with the Norfolk &amp; Western in 1959, civilian coal loading was shifted to Lambert&#x27;s Point, and the Navy purchased the site a few years later. The former VGN Sewells Point site is now part of the United States&#x27; Naval Station Norfolk.

=== Jamestown Exposition of 1907 ===
The Jamestown Exposition was one of the many world&#x27;s fairs and expositions that were popular in the United States early part of the 20th century. It was held from April 26 to December 1, 1907, at Sewells Point to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown Settlement in 1607.

Early in the 20th century, as the tercentennial neared, leaders in Norfolk began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities had gotten the ball rolling in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown, to be held on the 300th anniversary.

No one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site at Jamestown Island would be suitable. Jamestown had no facilities for large crowds, and the fort housing the Jamestown Settlement was believed to have been long-ago swallowed by the James River. However, there was an assumption in many parts of the state that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.

Hampton Roads&#x27; interest was awakened by an editorial in James M. Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Norfolk Dispatch&quot;, on February 4, 1901, proclaiming: &quot;Norfolk is undoubtedly the proper place for the holding of this celebration. Norfolk is today the center of the most populous portion of Virginia, and every historical, business and sentimental reason can be adduced in favor of the celebration taking place here rather than in Richmond.&quot;

The Dispatch was an unrelenting champion of Norfolk as the site for the exposition, noting in subsequent editorials that &quot;Richmond has absolutely no claim to the celebration except her location on the James River.&quot;

By September 1901, the Norfolk City Council had given support to the project and in December, 100 prominent residents of Hampton Roads journeyed to Richmond to urge Norfolk as the site. In 1902, the Jamestown Exposition Co. was incorporated. Former Virginia Governor Fitzhugh Lee, nephew of General Robert E. Lee, was named its president.

The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at Sewells Point. The location was politically correct, as it was almost an equal distance from the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News and Hampton. Rural Sewells Point was also conveniently located near any one of them. While hard to reach by land, it was more favorably accessible by water, which ultimately proved an asset.

The Jamestown Exposition proved to be a logistical nightmare. Roads had to be built to the site. Piers had to be constructed for moving supplies to exposition buildings. Hotels had to be raised to handle the exposition visitors, almost 3 million by the November closing. Bad weather slowed everything.

Another major setback was the death of Fitzhugh Lee. He died while in New England drumming up trade for the celebration. Henry St. George Tucker, another former Virginia Congressman, succeeded him. Norfolk businessman David Lowenberg ran most of the operation as director general.

Opening day had its share of headaches. Only a fifth of the electric lights could be turned on, and the Warpath recreation area was far from ready. Construction of the government pier left much of the ground in the center of the exposition muddy soup.

But in time, things improved and the event became spectacular. Planners asked each state of the union to contribute a house to celebrate its history and industry. Lack of interest or funds prevented participation by all, but 21 states funded houses, which bore their names: Pennsylvania House, Virginia House, New Hampshire House, North Carolina House, etc. During the exposition, days were set aside to honor the states individually. The governor of the state usually appeared to greet visitors to the state&#x27;s house. Thirteen of the state houses can still be seen on Dillingham Boulevard at the Naval Station Norfolk, on what has been called &quot;Admiral&#x27;s Row.&quot; Many of them are now residences of high-ranking Navy officers.

US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers also paid a visit, in the latter&#x27;s yacht &quot;Kanawha&quot;. Twain&#x27;s humorous talk was partly an introduction of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, &quot;In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I am not going to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough.&quot;

Although the exposition was a financial failure, it served an American purpose and one for Norfolk and Hampton Roads.

Perhaps the exposition&#x27;s most impressive display was on water rather than land. Ships of two squadrons commanded by Admiral Robley Evans formed a continuing presence off Sewells Point. The assembly included sixteen battleships, five cruisers, and six destroyers. The fleet remained in Hampton Roads after the exposition closed and became President Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;, which toured the globe as evidence of the nation&#x27;s military might. Nearly every Congressman and Senator of prominence had attended the exposition, and Admirals in Norfolk urged the creation of a Naval Base at the exposition site. However, nearly 10 years would elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War I, would become a reality.

On June 28, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson set aside $2.8 million for land purchase and the erection of storehouses and piers for the base. Of the originally acquired, 367 had been the old Jamestown Exposition grounds. The military property was later expanded considerably. The former Virginian Railway coal piers, land, and an adjacent coal storage facility owned by Norfolk &amp; Western Railway were added in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Sewells Point in the 21st century ==
Naval Station Norfolk currently occupies Sewells Point. The base is approximately and is the largest naval base in the world.

The headquarters of the 5th Naval District, the Atlantic Fleet, the 2nd Fleet, the NATO Joint Force Command Norfolk and NATO Allied Command Transformation are there. The Naval Complex includes Naval Station Norfolk, NAS Norfolk, as well as other Naval Facilities of the Hampton Roads area.

When the 78 ships and 133 aircraft home ported there are not at sea, they are alongside one of the 14 piers or inside one of the 15 aircraft hangars for repair, refit, training and to provide the ship&#x27;s or squadron&#x27;s crew an opportunity to be with their families. The base is home port to aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, large amphibious ships, submarines, and a variety of supply and logistics ships. Port Services controls more than 3,100 ships&#x27; movements annually as they arrive and depart their berths. Port facilities extend more than four miles (6 km) along the waterfront and include some seven miles (11 km) of pier and wharf space.

<doc id="1098230" wikidata="Q24256513" url="?curid=1098230" title="Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A">
<text>Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) is the first of Launch Complex 39&#x27;s three launch pads, located at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida. The pad, along with Launch Complex 39B, was first constructed in the 1960s to accommodate the Saturn V launch vehicle, and has been used to support NASA crewed space flight missions, including the historic Apollo 11 moon landing and the Space Shuttle. The site is currently leased by SpaceX and supports launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

== History ==
=== Apollo program ===
In 1961, U.S. President Kennedy proposed to the U.S. Congress the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Congressional approval led to the launch of the Apollo program, which required a massive expansion of NASA operations, including an expansion of launch operations from the Cape to adjacent Merritt Island to the north and west.

First named Launch Complex 39C, Launch Complex 39A was designed to handle launches of the Saturn V rocket, the largest and most powerful launch vehicle, which would propel the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. The first launch from Launch Complex 39A occurred in 1967 with the first Saturn V launch, which carried the uncrewed Apollo 4 spacecraft. The second uncrewed launch, Apollo 6, also used Pad 39A. With the exception of Apollo 10, which used Pad 39B (due to the &quot;all-up&quot; testing resulting in a 2-month turnaround period), all crewed Apollo-Saturn V launches, commencing with Apollo 8, used Pad 39A.

=== Skylab program ===
Launch Complex 39A was used for the uncrewed launch of the Skylab space station on May 14, 1973. This used a modified Saturn V originally built for the cancelled Apollo 18 mission. The subsequent Skylab crewed missions launched from Launch Complex 39B using Saturn IB launch vehicles.

=== Space Shuttle ===
With the advent of the Space Shuttle program in the early 1980s, the original structure of the launch pads were remodeled for the needs of the Space Shuttle. The first usage of Pad 39A for the Space Shuttle came in 1979, when &quot;Enterprise&quot; was used to check the facilities prior to the first operational launch. Since then, Pad 39A hosted all Space Shuttle launches until January 1986, when would become the first to launch from pad 39B during the ill-fated STS-51-L mission.

During the launch of &quot;Discovery&quot; on STS-124 on May 31, 2008, the pad at LC-39A suffered extensive damage, in particular to the concrete trench used to deflect the SRBs&#x27; flames. The subsequent investigation found that the damage was the result of carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors that held the refractory bricks in the trench in place. The damage had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters.

Just as for the first 24 shuttle flights, LC-39A supported the final shuttle flights, starting with STS-117 in June 2007 and ending with the retirement of the Shuttle fleet in July 2011. In total, Pad 39A hosted 94 launches from 1967 to 2011, including 12 Saturn V rockets and 82 space shuttles. Prior to the SpaceX lease agreement, the pad remained as it was when &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched on the final shuttle mission on July 8, 2011, complete with a mobile launcher platform. The pad was originally going to be modified for the Ares V rocket for the Constellation program in the mid 2010s, looking identical to LC-39B with the three lightning towers. The Ares I was planned to launch on the adjacent 39B but in 2010, the Constellation program was cancelled.

=== SpaceX ===
Talks for use of the pad were underway between NASA and Space Florida—the State of Florida&#x27;s economic development agency—as early as 2011, but no deal materialized by 2012, and NASA then pursued other options for removing the pad from the federal government inventory.

By early 2013, NASA publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease LC-39A, and followed that, in May 2013, with a formal solicitation for proposals for commercial use of the pad. There were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex. SpaceX submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex, while Jeff Bezos&#x27; Blue Origin submitted a bid for shared non-exclusive use of the complex, so that the launchpad would handle multiple vehicles, and costs could be shared over the long-term. One potential shared user in the Blue Origin plan was United Launch Alliance. Prior to the end of the bid period, and prior to any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process, Blue Origin filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) &quot;over what it says is a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39A&quot;. NASA had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest &quot;will delay any decision until the GAO reaches a decision, expected by mid-December&quot;. On December 12, 2013, the GAO denied the protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use. &quot;The [solicitation] document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility&quot;.

On December 13, 2013, NASA announced that it had selected SpaceX as the new commercial tenant. On April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a lease agreement that gave it a 20-year exclusive lease on LC-39A. SpaceX planned to launch their launch vehicles from the pad and build a new hangar nearby. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, stated that he wanted to shift most of SpaceX&#x27;s NASA launches to LC-39A, including commercial cargo and crew missions to the International Space Station.

==== Modifications ====
In 2015, SpaceX built the Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to house both the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy rockets, and their associated hardware and payloads, during preparation for flight. Both types of launch vehicles are transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which rides on rails up the former crawlerway path. Also in 2015, the launch mount for the Falcon Heavy was constructed on Pad 39A over the existing infrastructure. The work on both the HIF building and the pad was substantially complete by late 2015. A rollout test of the new Transporter Erector was conducted in November 2015.

In February 2016, SpaceX indicated that they had &quot;completed and activated Launch Complex 39A&quot;, but still had more work yet to do to support crewed flights. SpaceX originally planned to be ready to accomplish the first launch at pad 39A—of a Falcon Heavy—as early as 2015, as they had architects and engineers working on the new design and modifications since 2013. By late 2014, a preliminary date for a wet dress rehearsal of the Falcon Heavy was set for no earlier than July 1, 2015. Due to a failure in a June 2015 Falcon 9 launch, SpaceX delayed launching the Falcon Heavy in order to focus on the Falcon 9&#x27;s failure investigation and its return to flight. In early 2016, considering the busy Falcon 9 launch manifest, it became unclear if the Falcon Heavy would be the first vehicle to launch from Pad 39A, or if one or more Falcon 9 missions would precede a Falcon Heavy launch. In the following months, the Falcon Heavy launch was delayed multiple times and eventually pushed back to February 2018.

SpaceX used the former Fixed Service Structure (FSS) of the Pad 39A launch towers and initially intended to extend it above its former height. It did not need the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) and removed it beginning in February 2016.

NASA removed the Orbiter Servicing Arm—with intent to use the space later to build a museum—and the white room by which astronauts entered the Space Shuttle. SpaceX indicated in late 2014 that additional levels to the FSS would not be added in the near term. SpaceX planned to eventually add at least two additional levels to the FSS, to provide crew access for the Dragon 2 launches.

In August 2018, SpaceX&#x27;s Crew Access Arm (CAA) was installed on a new level, which was built at the necessary height to enter the Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket. It very closely resembles jetways that are frequently found at airports. In September 2018, the refurbished Space Shuttle Emergency Egress System was raised to this new level.

SpaceX added a crew gantry access arm and white room to allow for crew and cargo ingress to the vehicle. The existing Space Shuttle evacuation slide-wire basket system was re-purposed to provide a safe emergency egress for the Dragon crew in the event of an emergency on the pad that does not necessitate using the Crew Dragon&#x27;s launch abort system&quot;.

In 2019, SpaceX began substantial modification to LC 39A in order to begin work on phase 1 of the construction to prepare the facility to launch prototypes of the large -diameter methalox reusable rocket—Starship—from a launch stand, which would fly from 39A on suborbital test flight trajectories with six or fewer Raptor engines. A second phase of the construction was planned for 2020 to build a much more capable launch mount capable of launching the entire Starship launch vehicle, powered by 33 Raptor engines and producing a total of liftoff thrust when departing 39A.

In August 2019, SpaceX submitted an Environmental Assessment for the Starship launch system at Kennedy Space Center. This document included plans for the construction of additional structures at LC-39A to support Starship launches, including a dedicated pad, liquid methane tanks, and a Landing Zone. These are separate from the existing structures that support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

In December 2021, SpaceX started construction of a Starship orbital launch pad on the site.

On June 16, 2022, the first tower segment for the Starship orbital pad arrived at LC-39A. Stacking began on June 21, and the Starship launch mount was also under construction. In 2024, an additional Environmental Impact Statement was underway to support an annual launch cadence of 40+ Starship launches.

==== Launch history ====
The first SpaceX launch from pad 39A was SpaceX CRS-10 on February 19, 2017, using a Falcon 9 launch vehicle; it was the company&#x27;s 10th cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, and the first uncrewed launch from 39A since Skylab.

While Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) was undergoing reconstruction after the loss of the AMOS-6 satellite on September 1, 2016, all SpaceX&#x27;s east coast launches were from Pad 39A until SLC-40 became operational again in December 2017. These included the May 1, 2017, launch of NROL-76, the first SpaceX mission for the National Reconnaissance Office, with a classified payload.

On February 6, 2018, Pad 39A hosted the successful liftoff of the Falcon Heavy on its maiden launch, carrying Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster car to space; and the first flight of the human-rated spacecraft ; (Demo-1) took place there on March 2, 2019.

The second Falcon Heavy flight, carrying the Arabsat-6A communications satellite for Arabsat of Saudi Arabia, successfully launched on April 11, 2019. The satellite is to provide Ku-band and Ka-band communication services for the Middle East and northern Africa, as well as for South Africa. The launch was notable as it marked the first time that SpaceX was able to successfully soft-land all three of the reusable booster stages, which were to be refurbished for future launches.

The Crew Dragon Demo-2 test flight launched with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley from Launch Complex 39A on 30 May 2020, and docked to pressurised mating adapter PMA-2 on the Harmony module of the ISS on 31 May 2020. The first operational Commercial Crew mission Crew-1 was launched on November 15, 2020.

SpaceX launched the IM-1 robotic lander for NASA&#x27;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program on 15 February 2024, returning the pad to Lunar missions since the end of the Apollo program. The Starlink Group 6-56 mission launched on 8 May 2024, and was the Falcon 9&#x27;s 83rd launch from LC-39A. That milestone made the rocket family the pad leader for launches from that launch complex, surpassing the Space Shuttle&#x27;s 82 launches.

== Launch statistics ==
== Current status ==
The private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company SpaceX has been the lease holder as of April 14, 2014. The terms of the agreement gave SpaceX a 20-year exclusive lease to LC-39A. SpaceX has launched their launch vehicles from the pad since the launch of the SpaceX CRS-10 Dragon resupply mission in 2017, and crewed missions since the launch of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission in 2020. Currently Pad 39A is used to host launches of astronauts on the crewed-version of the Dragon space capsule in a public–private partnership with NASA. 

SpaceX assembles its launch vehicles horizontally in a hangar near the pad and transports them horizontally to the pad before erecting the vehicle to vertical for the launch. For military missions from Pad 39A, payloads are vertically integrated, as that is required per a launch contract with the United States Air Force.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Anne Caplan was born on June 30, 1982, in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in its Miracle Mile district. Her family are Reform Jews of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. She had a Bat Mitzvah and attended Jewish summer camp. Her father, Richard Caplan, was a lawyer and her mother, Barbara (née Bragman), was a political aide. She is the youngest of three children with a brother, Benjamin, and a sister, Julie. Her mother died of cancer when she was 13 years old. Her uncle was publicist Howard Bragman. Caplan attended Alexander Hamilton High School in Castle Heights, and attended the school&#x27;s Academy of Music. She first focused on playing the piano, then later decided to pursue drama. She was also on her school&#x27;s soccer team. She graduated in 2000, but did not attend college because she wanted to focus on acting.

==Career==

Caplan began her acting career in 1999, first playing a girl named Sara in the critically acclaimed series &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;. Due to her performance, her character became the girlfriend of Jason Segel&#x27;s character. She then had a series of guest appearances on numerous shows, and appeared in Jason Mraz&#x27;s music video &quot;You and I Both&quot;. In 2000 she appeared in her first film &quot;From Where I Sit&quot; which was released straight to television. In 2001, she played Tina Greer in an episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;, and reprised her role on the show in 2003. She appeared in two episodes of the ABC series &quot;Once and Again&quot;. In 2003, she starred in the television series &quot;The Pitts&quot;, playing Faith Pitt. She gained wider notice for playing Janis Ian in the 2004 film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. She played Avery Bishop in the second season of &quot;Tru Calling&quot;.

In 2005, Caplan played troubled sister Marjee Sorelli in &quot;Related&quot;, a one-hour comedy-drama on The WB that was canceled after one season. In 2006, she starred as Sara Weller in the thriller film &quot;Love is the Drug&quot; and was named one of &quot;10 Actors to Watch&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot;. After &quot;Related&quot; ended, Caplan was cast in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Class&quot;, which premiered in September 2006 and lasted for one season. She played Kat Warbler, one of several elementary school friends that reunite after 20 years.

In 2008, Caplan played Marlena Diamond in the film &quot;Cloverfield&quot; and was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared as Ami in the romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;. Later that year, she guest-starred as Amy Burley on the HBO vampire show &quot;True Blood&quot;. She was the voice of Faith Pitt in the proposed animated version of &quot;The Pitts&quot;, which was developed in 2007. She also appeared in the critically acclaimed Starz ensemble comedy &quot;Party Down&quot;, playing a struggling comedian who is part of a catering crew. In 2010, she appeared in &quot;127 Hours&quot;.

In early 2012, Caplan premiered two films at the Sundance Film Festival: &quot;Save the Date&quot; and &quot;Bachelorette&quot;. Also in 2012, she appeared as Julia in several episodes of the Fox sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot;.

She played Agent Lacey in the 2014 film &quot;The Interview&quot;.

===&quot;Masters of Sex&quot; (2013–2016)===

In 2013, she began playing 1960s human sexuality pioneer Virginia E. Johnson on the Showtime series &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;. Caplan also provided her own vocals for a cover version of the song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; in the &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; episode &quot;Phallic Victories&quot;. Her performance on the show was well-reviewed, and on July 10, 2014, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

Caplan was cast in her role as Johnson before they signed her co-star Michael Sheen as William H. Masters because he was busy working on another production. Producer Sarah Timberman said of Caplan, &quot;The minute we met Lizzie we thought that she just embodied so much of the spirit of Virginia Johnson.&quot; Caplan also stated herself that as a single woman pursuing her career above a family, she identified with many of Johnson&#x27;s characteristics. Once she met the producers, it took several months before Caplan was officially signed, and she turned down several other roles in the meantime.

Virginia Johnson had worked alongside William H. Masters as they completed research of human sexual response and sexual dysfunction beginning in the late 1950s. To learn about the characters they were portraying, Caplan along with her other co-stars read Thomas Maier&#x27;s 2009 biography &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;. The author also allowed Caplan to listen to some of his interview tapes with Johnson. Caplan also attempted to spend some time with Johnson before she died in 2013, but Johnson was ambivalent about the development of the show. It was the first time Caplan portrayed a real person and she mentioned in an interview that she felt a &quot;deep responsibility&quot; to Johnson, but that she had some wiggle room because most people have no idea what Johnson looked or sounded like. Maier stated that the developers of the show have remained mostly accurate to his book and have included other events that are historically relevant to St. Louis, where the series takes place and where Masters and Johnson lived. Caplan has discussed becoming comfortable with the large number of sex scenes in &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;.

Her portrayal earned her nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award, Satellite Award and Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award, all for Outstanding Lead Actress.

==Personal life==
Caplan became engaged to British actor Tom Riley in New York in May 2016. They had met in January 2015 while Caplan was filming &quot;Now You See Me 2&quot; in London and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Prague Opera Ball in February 2016. They married in September 2017, and have a son born in 2021. Previously, Caplan dated Matthew Perry from 2006 until 2012.

<text>Beacon Hill is a neighbourhood located in Beacon Hill-Cyrville Ward in the east end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Beacon Hill was a part of the City of Gloucester until it was amalgamated with the new city of Ottawa in 2001.

Beacon Hill is a primarily residential area, built in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. It consists of two parts, Beacon Hill North and Beacon Hill South, divided by Montreal Road. It includes the Robert O. Pickard sewage treatment plant and three high schools, Colonel By Secondary School, Gloucester High School, and Lester B. Pearson Catholic High School. According to the Beacon Hill Community Association, the neighbourhood is bounded on the east by the Greenbelt, including the Green&#x27;s Creek ravine, to the south by Highway 174, and on the west by Blair Road (south of Montreal Road) and Rothwell Heights (north of Montreal Road).

Beacon Hill North had a population of 9,177 while Beacon Hill South had a population of 8,319 (17,496 total) according to the Canada 2016 Census.

==Sub-neighbourhoods==
*Beacon Heights
*Beacon Hill North
*Beacon Hill South
*Beaconwood
*Cardinal Heights
*Rothwell Village

==History==
It is most likely that the community drew its name from a lighthouse in the Ottawa River, downstream from Duck Island. It is thought that the light from the river could be seen from Naskapi Dr. (the top of the hill), hence Beacon Hill. Though the lighthouse is no longer in use, its foundation is still visible from the bike path.

The &#x27;Hill&#x27; the name refers to is actually a ridge running roughly parallel to the Ottawa River. A large area of the ridge is the municipal Ski Hill Park. An open area of the park located behind the Beacon Hill Mall on Ogilvie Road is a very popular winter sledding and skiing hill. while the remaining two thirds (approximate) of Ski Hill Park is undeveloped natural woodlands with many walking and snowshoeing trails throughout.

== Community Association ==
In the mid- to late 1970s the Beacon Hill Community Association was formed. It was disbanded for lack of interest in the late 1980s. It was later revived as the Beacon Hill North Community Association (with borders to match the name) in 2009 by a group of residents, with the main goal to rally residents to help save local High School Colonel By from being closed.

In 2010 it was returned to the Beacon Hill Community Association, again with the expanded borders to include Beacon Hills North and South.

== Schools ==
*Le Phare Elementary School (French Immersion Public)
*Robert Hopkins Public School (English/French Immersion Public)
*Henry Munro Middle School (English/French Immersion Public)
*Colonel By Secondary School (English/French Immersion Public, with International Baccalaureate Program)

*Lester B. Pearson Catholic High School
*Brother Andre Catholic School (former Elmridge Catholic)

== Toboggan Hills ==

<text>Loktantrik Morcha Himachal Pradesh (abbr LMHP) Democratic Front Himachal Pradesh was a political party in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. LM(HP) was registered as a political party in 2003. It is led by Mohinder Singh, former Himachal Vikas Congress minister and convenor of Him Loktantrik Morcha.

But shortly after the 1998 elections, a group of BJP legislators demanded his resignation on ground of corruption. HVC leader Sukh Ram had to bow to their demand, and Singh was expelled from HVC. Initially Singh joined Lok Janshakti Party. Ahead of the 2003 assembly elections he launched LMHP as a political party and was elected as its sole member of the assembly. In total LMHP had 14 candidates, who together got 66,102 votes (2,17% of the votes in the state).

In the 2004 elections LM(HP) supported the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Ahead of the elections there were discussions on a merger with BJP, He merged his party with the BJP in 2004.In the 2007 election he fought the election under the ticket of bjp and again retained his seat.

<text>Beacon Hill is a hill and neighborhood in southeastern Seattle, Washington. It is roughly bounded on the west by Interstate 5, on the north by Interstate 90, on the east by Rainier Avenue South, Cheasty Boulevard South, and Martin Luther King Junior Way South, and on the south by the Seattle city boundary. It is part of Seattle&#x27;s South End.

The neighborhood has a major population of Asian Americans and African Americans and is among the most racially diverse in Seattle. It was formerly home to the world headquarters of Amazon (at the Pacific Tower) and present home to the Seattle Division of the Department of Veterans Affairs&#x27; Puget Sound Health Care System.

==Geography==

Beacon Hill offers views of downtown, the Industrial District, Elliott Bay, First Hill, Rainier Valley, and, when the weather is good, Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountains. It is roughly bounded on the west by Interstate 5, on the north by Interstate 90, on the east by Rainier Avenue South, Cheasty Boulevard South, and Martin Luther King Junior Way South, and on the south by the Seattle city boundary. It is part of Seattle&#x27;s South End.

The municipal government subdivides it into North Beacon Hill, Mid-Beacon Hill, Holly Park, and South Beacon Hill, though most people who live there simply call it &quot;Beacon Hill.&quot;

Homes on the northern part of the hill were mostly built in the early 1900s; thus, North Beacon Hill contains many examples of Craftsman bungalows and Seattle box houses, a local variant of the Foursquare style.

==History and demographics==

The Duwamish call the hill &quot;Greenish-Yellow Spine&quot; (Lushootseed: qWátSéécH, pronounced QWAH-tseech), probably referring to the color of the deciduous trees that once grew thickly on the hill. Early settlers named it Holgate and Hanford Hill after two early settlers, John Holgate and Edward Hanford, who settled in the area in the 1850s and are commemorated to this day by South Holgate and Hanford Streets on North Beacon Hill. A later arrival, M. Harwood Young, named the hill after the Beacon Hill in his hometown, Boston, Massachusetts.

Beacon Avenue, the main thoroughfare through the neighborhood, was built with a wide median that covered the wooden pipe carrying Seattle&#x27;s drinking water supply from the Cedar River. The water main had been constructed in 1901 along the ridgeline of the hill. The street was later used for streetcar service from 1931 to 1941 and utility poles—becoming a &quot;pole forest&quot; by the 1950s. The city government relocated the utility poles and beautified Beacon Avenue in the 1970s and 1980s, which included landscaping the median into a walking trail.

Beacon Hill was nicknamed &quot;Boeing Hill&quot; in the 1950s and 60s due to the number of residents who worked in the nearby Boeing airplane factory. The term fell out of use when many Boeing employees joined the general exodus to the suburbs, and Asian immigrants took their place. Today the neighborhood is majority Asian, as can be seen by the many Chinese, Vietnamese, and Filipino businesses along Beacon Avenue South. However, the area remains racially diverse, as shown by the 2000 United States census: 51% Asian, 20% white, 13% black, 9% Hispanic/Latino and 7% other. The census also showed the total Beacon Hill population to be 22,300. Neighboring Rainier Valley also shows a similar diversity.

==Awards and honors==

In 2012, the American Planning Association named Beacon Hill as one of the 30 Great Places in America.

==Culture==

The Beacon Arts Guild is a community nonprofit arts organization that is based on Beacon Hill. They organize cultural events in the neighborhood and sponsor affordable housing and studio space for artists. A summer music festival, named &quot;Beacon Rocks&quot;, was organized in the 2010s by another organization to host monthly performances on the Roberto Maestas Festival Street.

The neighborhood is home to the Beacon Food Forest, an urban food forest on adjacent to Jefferson Park that was created in 2012. The project is part of the city&#x27;s P-Patch network of shared neighborhood farms and is maintained year-round by volunteers. It includes walnuts, chestnuts, berry shrubs and vegetables.

<doc id="1098261" wikidata="Q1141779" url="?curid=1098261" title="Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale">
<text>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test designed to measure intelligence and cognitive ability in adults and older adolescents. For children between the ages of 6 and 16, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is commonly used. 

The original WAIS (Form I) was published in February 1955 by David Wechsler, Chief Psychologist at Bellevue Hospital (1932–1967) in NYC, as a revision of the Wechsler–Bellevue Intelligence Scale released in 1939. It is currently in its fifth edition (&quot;WAIS-5&quot;), released in 2024 by Pearson. It is the most widely used IQ test, for both adults and older adolescents, in the world.

==History==
The WAIS was founded to get to know Wechsler&#x27;s patients at Bellevue Hospital and on his definition of intelligence, which he defined as &quot;... the global capacity of a person to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment.&quot; He believed that intelligence was made up of specific elements that could be isolated, defined, and subsequently measured. However, these individual elements were not entirely independent, but were all interrelated. His argument, in other words, is that general intelligence is composed of various specific and interrelated functions or elements that can be individually measured.

This theory differed greatly from the Binet-Simon Intelligence Test which, in Wechsler&#x27;s day, was generally considered the supreme authority with regard to intelligence testing. A drastically revised new version of the Binet scale, released in 1937, received a great deal of criticism from David Wechsler (after whom the original Wechsler–Bellevue Intelligence scale and the modern Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV are named).
* Wechsler was a very influential advocate for the concept of non-intellective factors, and he felt that the 1937 Binet scale did not do a good job of incorporating these factors into the scale (non-intellective factors are variables that contribute to the overall score in intelligence, but are not made up of intelligence-related items. These include things such as lack of confidence, fear of failure, attitudes, etc.).
* Wechsler did not agree with the idea of a single score that the Binet test gave.
* Wechsler argued that the Binet scale items were not valid for adult test-takers because the items were chosen specifically for use with children.
* The &quot;Binet scale&#x27;s emphasis on speed, with timed tasks scattered throughout the scale, tended to unduly handicap older adults.&quot;
* Wechsler believed that &quot;mental age norms clearly did not apply to adults.&quot;
* Wechsler criticized the then existing Binet scale because &quot;it did not consider that intellectual performance could deteriorate as a person grew older.&quot;

These criticisms of the 1937 Binet test helped produce the Wechsler–Bellevue scale, released in 1939. However, the present-day WAIS-IV has contradicted many of these criticisms, by incorporating a single overall score, using multiple timed tasks, focusing on intellective items and other ways. While this scale has been revised (resulting in the present day WAIS-IV), many of the original concepts Wechsler argued for have become standards in psychological testing, including the point-scale concept and the performance-scale concept.

==Wechsler–Bellevue Intelligence Scale==
The Wechsler–Bellevue tests were innovative in the 1930s because they:
# gathered tasks created for nonclinical purposes for administration as a &quot;clinical test battery&quot;,
# used the point scale concept instead of the age scale, and
# included a non-verbal performance scale.

=== Point scale concept ===
In the Binet scales (prior to the 1986 version) items were grouped according to age level. Each of these age levels was composed of a group of tasks that could be passed by two-thirds to three-quarters of the individuals in that level. This meant that items were not arranged according to content. Additionally, an individual taking a Binet test would only receive credit if a certain number of the tasks were completed. This meant that falling short just one task required for the credit, resulted in no credit at all (for example, if passing three out of four tasks was required to receive credit, then passing two yielded no credit).

The point scale concept significantly changed the way testing was done by assigning credits or points to each item. This had two large effects. First, this allowed items to be grouped according to content. Second, participants were able to receive a set number of points or credits for each item passed. The result was a test that could be made up of different content areas (or subtests) with both an overall score and a score for each content area. In turn, this allowed for an analysis to be made of an individual&#x27;s ability in a variety of content areas (as opposed to one general score).

===The Non-Verbal Performance Scale===
The non-verbal performance scale was also a critical difference from the Binet scale. The earlier Binet scale had been persistently and consistently criticized for its emphasis on language and verbal skills. Wechsler designed an entire scale that allowed the measurement of non-verbal intelligence. This became known as a performance scale. This scale required a subject to actively do something, such as copying symbols or pointing to a missing detail in a picture, rather than just answering questions. This was an important development, as it attempted to overcome biases that were caused by &quot;language, culture, and education.&quot; Further, this scale also provided an opportunity to observe a different type of behavior, because something physical was required. Clinicians were able to observe how a participant reacted to the &quot;longer interval of sustained effort, concentration, and attention&quot; that the performance tasks required.
As the Wechsler–Bellevue scale was the first to effectively use the performance scale, it also introduced the &quot;possibility of directly comparing an individual&#x27;s verbal and nonverbal intelligence&quot;. This was possible as &quot;the results of both scales were expressed in comparable units&quot;. The Binet scale did have performance tasks, but they were geared toward younger children. The Wechsler-Bellevue was also unique in that there were entire tests that were considered supplements or alternatives, including &quot;performance&quot; measures such as the Leiter International Performance Scale.

==WAIS==
The WAIS was initially created as a revision of the Wechsler–Bellevue Intelligence Scale (WBIS), which was a battery of tests published by Wechsler in 1939. The WBIS was composed of subtests that could be found in various other intelligence tests of the time, such as Robert Yerkes&#x27; army testing program and the Binet-Simon scale. The WAIS was first released in February 1955 by David Wechsler. Because the Wechsler tests included non-verbal items (known as &quot;performance scales&quot;) as well as verbal items for all test-takers, and because the 1960 form of Lewis Terman&#x27;s Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales was less carefully developed than previous versions, Form I of the WAIS surpassed the Stanford–Binet tests in popularity by the 1960s.

==WAIS-R==

The WAIS-R, a revised form of the WAIS, was released in 1981 and consisted of six verbal and five performance subtests. The verbal tests were: Information, Comprehension, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Similarities, and Vocabulary. The Performance subtests were: Picture Arrangement, Picture Completion, Block Design, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol. A verbal IQ, performance IQ and full scale IQ were obtained.

This revised edition did not provide new validity data, but used the data from the original WAIS; however new norms were provided, carefully stratified.

==WAIS-III==
The WAIS-III, a subsequent revision of the WAIS and the WAIS-R, was released in 1997. It provided scores for Verbal IQ, Performance IQ, and Full Scale IQ, along with four secondary indices (Verbal Comprehension, Working Memory, Perceptual Organization, and Processing Speed). Some new contributors to the third edition of the most commonly used test of intellectual abilities include Hsin‐Yi Chen, Louise O’Donnell, Mark Ledbetter, David Tulsky, and Jianjun Zhu.

===Verbal IQ (VIQ)===
Included seven tests and provided two sub-indices; verbal comprehension and working memory.

The Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) included the following tests:
* Information
* Similarities
* Vocabulary

The Working Memory Index (WMI) included:
* Arithmetic
* Digit Span
* Letter-Number-Sequencing

Subtest(s) not included in the sub-indices:
* Comprehension

Supplementary subtest(s) (Only to be used for total VIQ index scoring and specified sub-index):
* Letter-Number-Sequencing

===Performance IQ (PIQ)===
Included six tests and it also provided two sub-indices; perceptual organization and processing speed.

The Perceptual Organization Index (POI) included:
* Block Design
* Matrix Reasoning
* Picture Completion

The Processing Speed Index (PSI) included:
* Digit Symbol-Coding
* Symbol Search

Subtest(s) not included in the sub-indices:
* Picture Arrangement

Supplementary subtests (Only to be used for total PIQ index scoring and specified sub-index):
* Object Assembly
* Symbol Search

==WAIS-IV==
The current version of the test, the WAIS-IV, which was released in 2008, is composed of 10 core subtests and five supplemental subtests, with the 10 core subtests yielding scaled scores that sum to derive the Full Scale IQ. With the WAIS-IV, the verbal/performance IQ scores from previous versions were removed and replaced by the index scores. The General Ability Index (GAI) was included, which consists of the Similarities, Vocabulary and Information subtests from the Verbal Comprehension Index and the Block Design, Matrix Reasoning and Visual Puzzles subtests from the Perceptual Reasoning Index. The GAI is clinically useful because it can be used as a measure of cognitive abilities that are less vulnerable to impairments of processing speed and working memory. There are several notable features in this version of the intelligence scale that make it unique from previous versions. Some of these changes include the removal of Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, Mazes, Verbal IQ, and Performance IQ and the addition of five subtests that emphasize fluid reasoning and/or working memory. 

===Index scores and scales===
There are four index scores representing major components of intelligence:
* Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI)
* Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI)
* Working Memory Index (WMI)
* Processing Speed Index (PSI)

Two broad scores, which can be used to summarize general intellectual ability, can also be derived:
* Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), based on the total combined performance of the VCI, PRI, WMI, and PSI. The WAIS-IV can generate an FSIQ in the range of 40 to 160.
* General Ability Index (GAI), based only on the six subtests that the VCI and PRI comprise; it is intended to portray a snapshot of general intelligence that is less influenced by working memory and processing speed demands.

===Standardization===

The WAIS-IV was standardized on a sample of 2,200 people in the United States, ranging in age from 16 to 90. The demographic characteristics of the sample were modeled after the proportions of different groups in an analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau. An extension of the standardization has been conducted with 688 Canadians in the same age range.

==WAIS-5==
The fifth edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was released in late 2024. Normative data were collected in 2023–24 on a U.S. Census-reflective sample that was conormed on the Wechsler Memory Scale: Fifth Edition.

The WAIS-5 introduces several new subtests, particularly in the working memory domain, with Digit Span Sequencing and Running Digits now being the core subtests that compose the Working Memory Index. Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, Spatial Addition, Symbol Span, and Letter-Number Sequencing may also be used to construct the Expanded Working Memory Index.

The Perceptual Reasoning Index has been split into Visual Spatial Ability (Block Design, Visual Puzzles) and Fluid Reasoning (Matrix Reasoning, Figure Weights). A complementary Fluid Reasoning subtest Set Relations was also introduced, as well as an additional Processing Speed subtest Naming Speed Quantity, which was originally featured in the WISC-V.

The Full Scale Intelligence Quotient is now generated from only seven subtests (Similarities, Vocabulary, Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, Figure Weights, Digit Span Sequencing, Coding), similar to the WISC-V. Fifteen ancillary index scores, including the General Ability Index, are also present.

Administration is anticipated to be shorter than the WAIS-IV, especially for those who are suspected as being intellectually gifted. The test may be administered in the classic physical format or on a digital platform.

==Age range and uses==
The WAIS-IV measure is acceptable for use with people who are 16–90 years of age. For people younger than 16, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI, 2½–7 years, 7 months) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC, 6–16 years) are used.

Intelligence tests may be used to assess the level of cognitive functioning in individuals with psychiatric illness or brain injury. Rehabilitation psychologists and neuropsychologists use neuropsychological tests (including the WAIS-IV) to assess how the individual&#x27;s brain is functioning after it has been injured. Specific subtests can provide insight into specific cognitive functions; for example, the digit span subtest could be used to look for attentional difficulties.

The Wechsler tests can also be used to identify intellectual giftedness, and are commonly accepted as qualifying evidence for high-IQ societies, such as Mensa, Intertel and the Triple Nine Society.

==WASI-II==

The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence – 2nd edition (WASI-II) is a short psychological test that was developed in 2011 by Pearson to estimate intellectual functioning in a shorter period of time than the WAIS-IV. The WASI-II only has 4 subtests: Block Design, Vocabulary, Similarities, and Matrix Reasoning, compared to the 10 core subtests that are present in the WAIS-IV. These 4 subtests have the same structure as the similarly-named subtests on the WAIS-IV, but have different questions.

The WASI-II can derive 4 composite scores from a combination of the 4 subtests. A Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) can be derived from the raw scores on the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests. A Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) can be derived from the raw scores on the Matrix Reasoning and Block Design subtests. A Full Scale IQ-2 (FSIQ-2) can be derived from the raw scores on the Matrix Reasoning and Vocabulary subtests, while a Full Scale IQ-4 (FSIQ-4) can be derived from the raw scores on all 4 subtests.

<text>Him Loktantrik Morcha was a political front in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. HLM was formed ahead of the 2002 Shimla Municipal Corporation elections, as an alternative to both Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. The convenor of HLM was Mohinder Singh Chaudhury. The front consisted of Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Janata Dal (Secular), the Lok Janshakti Party, the Samajwadi Party and a few secular regional parties.

Following dissatisfaction over Singh&#x27;s move to make HLM into a political party, Samajwadi Party, Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) and Janata Dal (Secular) formed the &quot;Himachal Jan Morcha&quot; (Himalyana People&#x27;s Front) in October 2002.

Singh later registered Loktantrik Morcha (Himachal Pradesh) as a political party.

<doc id="1098265" wikidata="Q419415" url="?curid=1098265" title="Simeticone">
<text>Simeticone (INN), also known as simethicone (USAN), is an anti-foaming agent used to reduce bloating, discomfort or pain caused by excessive gas.

==Medical uses==

Simeticone is used to relieve the symptoms of excessive gas in the gastrointestinal tract, namely bloating, burping, and flatulence. While there is a lack of conclusive evidence that simeticone is effective for this use,⁣ studies have shown that it can relieve symptoms of functional dyspepsia and functional bloating.

It has not been fully established that simeticone is useful to treat colic in babies, and it is not recommended for this purpose. A study in the United Kingdom reported that according to parental perception simeticone helped infant colic in some cases.

Simeticone can also be used for suspected postoperative abdominal discomfort in infants.

==Side effects==
Simeticone does not have any serious side effects. Two uncommon side effects (occurring in 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 patients) are constipation and nausea.

==Pharmacology==
Simeticone is a non-systemic surfactant which decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract. This allows gas bubbles to leave the GI tract as flatulence or belching. Simeticone does not reduce or prevent the formation of gas. Its effectiveness has been shown in several in vitro studies.

==Chemistry==
Simeticone is a mixture of dimethicone and silicon dioxide.

==Names==
The INN name is &quot;simeticone&quot;, which was added to the INN recommended list in 1999.

Simeticone is marketed under many brand names and in many combination drugs; it is also marketed as a veterinary drug.

<text>Beacon Hill () is a hill in the northern part of the Kowloon peninsula in Hong Kong. It is the 71st-highest hill of Hong Kong and is 457m tall. Beacon Hill is located within the Lion Rock Country Park. The tower and its relevant equipment on the top of Beacon Hill is not open to the public and is a secured facility controlled and maintained by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department.

==Name==
The hill&#x27;s name dates back to the Great Clearance between 1661 and 1669, which required the complete evacuation of the coastal areas of Kowloon in Hong Kong in order to fight against and then subsequently defeat the anti-Qing movement that was first started and largely led by surviving Ming Dynasty loyalists carrying on the struggle against the new Manchu-formed Qing Dynasty. Qing military garrisons were created and stationed throughout most of Kowloon&#x27;s coastal areas to enforce the Qing government&#x27;s decree in locations which later became referred to as beacons.

==Conservation==
The steep north face of Beacon Hill, together with a valley to the north-east of Eagle&#x27;s Nest, covering a total area of 53.2 hectares, was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1979.

<text>Beacon Hill is a suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 17 kilometres north-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. It is part of the Northern Beaches region.

==History==
Beacon Hill was given the title when the Department of Lands built a trigonometric beacon there in 1881.

=== Aboriginal culture===
Little is known of local aboriginal culture in the Beacon Hill area but other local areas towards the sea have a rich and diverse aboriginal background. There are some aboriginal carvings in rocks to the north of Red Hill.

=== European settlement===
Daniel Egan, a member of the NSW Parliament, purchased two parcels of land on 5 October 1857.

Most of the houses in the suburb were built in the boom days after World War II, in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the streets in Beacon Hill are named after notable battles, military men or places where Australian troops served in World War II. These include Owen Stanley Avenue, Kokoda Crescent, Goroka Place and Lae Place.

Beacon Hill Post Office opened on 1 August 1949 and closed in 1986. Beacon Hill High School was established in 1964 and closed in 2002.

==Demographics==
According to the , there were 7,814 people in Beacon Hill. 68.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 5.5%, China 2.6%, Italy 2.3% and New Zealand 2.0%. 77.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 3.2%, Mandarin 2.4% and Cantonese 1.3%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 36.4%, Catholic 29.3% and Anglican 13.3%.

== Transport ==
Beacon Hill is serviced by Keolis Downer Northern Beaches bus services. Warringah Road (A38) runs east/west through the suburb and provides access to Dee Why in the east and Roseville in the west.

== Landmarks ==

===Governor Phillip Lookout===
This lookout is located atop Beacon Hill itself. Views of almost the entire eastern half of the Sydney region may be had from the summit which is approximately 152 metres (500 ft) above sea level.

Views extend from the southern outskirts of Sydney, west to the Blue Mountains and north to Gosford and the Central Coast. The skyline of the city is to the south. Ships, pleasure craft and occasional migratory whales can be seen out to sea in the east.

The lookout is popular with locals on New Year&#x27;s Eve when the firework displays across Sydney Harbour are clearly visible, approximately 11 kilometres (7 mi) to the south.

The lookout may be reached via Warringah Road. There is a small parking area adjacent to the road with stairs leading to a pathway and the summit.

===Red Hill===
Red Hill, not to be confused with Beacon Hill, is located at the northern end of the suburb behind the former Beacon Hill High School site. From here there are views across to the Governor Phillip Lookout, and onwards to the city. The views to the north are over the eastern sections of the Garigal National Park, to Cromer and beyond into the suburbs of Elanora, Narrabeen and Ingleside.

The Red Hill Preservation Society attempted to prevent a state government development of Red Hill in the early 1990s.

== Community services and organizations ==

The Governor Phillip Lookout Trust was gazetted on 9 December 1966 and was charged with the responsibility not only of protecting and developing the area as an historical feature of the district, but also for the preservation and propagation of the native flora and fauna that surrounds the lookout. The first meeting took place on 10 April 1966.

On 13 October 2017, Paul Toole, Minister for Lands and Forestry transferred responsibility for the Trust to Northern Beaches Council.

<doc id="1098271" wikidata="Q7253359" url="?curid=1098271" title="Germanic kingship">
<text>Germanic kingship is a thesis regarding the role of kings among the pre-Christianized Germanic tribes of the Migration period (c. 300–700 AD) and Early Middle Ages (c. 700–1000 AD). The thesis holds that the institution of feudal monarchy developed, through contact with the Roman Empire and the Christian Church, from an earlier custom of sacral and military kingship based on both birth status and consent from subjects.

The term barbarian kingdom is used in the context of those Germanic rulers who after 476 AD and during the 6th century ruled territories formerly part of the Western Roman Empire, especially the Barbarian kings of Italy. In the same context, Germanic law is also derisively termed &quot;leges barbarorum&quot; &quot;barbarian law&quot; etc.

The thesis of Germanic kingship appeared in the nineteenth century and was influential in the historiography of early medieval society, but has since come under criticism for drawing generalizations from limited evidence.

==Alleged characteristics==
The Germanic king originally had three main functions:
*To serve as judge during the popular assemblies.
*To serve as a priest during the sacrifices.
*To serve as a military leader during wars.

The office was received hereditarily, but a new king required the consent of the people before assuming the throne. All sons of the king had the right to claim the throne, which often led to co-rulership (diarchy) where two brothers were elected kings at the same time. This evolved into the territories being considered the hereditary property of the kings, patrimonies, a system which fueled feudal wars, because the kings could claim ownership of lands beyond their &quot;de facto&quot; rule.

As a sort of pre-Christianization high priest, the king often claimed descent from some deity. In the Scandinavian nations, he administered pagan sacrifices (blóts) at important cult sites, such as the Temple at Uppsala. Refusal to administer the blóts could lead to the king losing power (see Haakon the Good and Anund Gårdske).

According to the testimony of Tacitus (&quot;Germania&quot;), some early Germanic peoples had an elective monarchy already in the 1st century.
In the election of kings they have regard to birth; in that of generals, to valor.

Germanic pre-Christianization society had three levels, the king, the nobility and the free men.
Their respective political influence was negotiated at the thing. According to the testimony of Tacitus,

On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of greater importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance, that what is referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely discussed by the chiefs. [...] When they all think fit, they sit down armed. Silence is proclaimed by the priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power. Then the king, or chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age, birth, military renown, or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention rather from their ability to persuade, than their authority to command. If a proposal displease, the assembly reject it by an inarticulate murmur; if it prove agreeable, they clash their javelins.

Tacitus notes that as each tribe had its own customary law, the political power of the king could vary between nations. Thus, he states that the Gothones were ruled by a monarchy &quot;somewhat more strict than that of the other German nations, yet not to a degree incompatible with liberty&quot; while beyond the Gothones, the Rugii and Lemovii (tribes placed at the far end of Magna Germania, near the Baltic Sea) lived in &quot;submission to regal authority&quot;.

==Later development==
With the decline of the Roman Empire, many of its provinces came under the rule of Germanic kings: Hispania to the Visigoths, Italia to the Ostrogoths, Gallia to the Franks, Britannia to the Anglo-Saxons, and Africa to the Vandals. These nations had by then been in contact with Rome for a century or more and had adopted many Roman customs. They were also undergoing Christianisation and pre-Christianization practice was slowly being replaced.

The Frankish state under the Merovingian dynasty had many of the characteristics of Germanic monarchy under heavy influence from secular and ecclesiastic Rome. Its kings, through their division of the territory, treated it not as a state independent of themselves, but as their patrimony, land won by conquest (theirs and their forefathers&#x27;). The king was primarily a war leader and a judge. There are many theories to explain the collapse of Merovingian power, most of which blame the inability of later Merovingians in war as an important factor. The commonly cited occasion of Sigebert III sobbing in his saddle after a defeat (the king was then only ten years old) highlights the importance of victory in battle for a king who is chiefly a warrior.

The principle of election, which determined Germanic succession, was abandoned in those states under the heaviest influence from the papacy, such as Merovingian Gaul, where hereditary succession and the divine right of the reigning dynasty was recognised. In Anglo-Saxon Britain, the principle survived until the Norman Conquest removed it. Anglo-Saxon kings were elected by the witena gemót. Finally, the principle survived in some form or other for centuries after the demise of the last Germanic monarchies. The civil wars of medieval Scandinavia and the electorate of the Holy Roman Empire are part of its legacy.

==Foreign visitors by country==
Most visitors arriving to Romania in 2022 were from the following countries:
==Facilities for disabled travellers==
Facilities for disabled travellers in Romania range from patchy to nonexistent. Anyone with mobility problems should go prepared and ideally have local contacts. 
Although it has made some slow strides towards disabled access since then, and new buildings need to be wheelchair-accessible, implementation has been very poor. In practice Romania remains by and large off-limits to disabled travellers.

==Industrial and creative tourism==
Industrial tourism, as a niche of tourism in Romania and as a solution to the restructuring and disappearance of former large industrial sites (mining, metallurgy, heavy industry), takes on interest in the country still slowly, despite the country&#x27;s join to the European Union in 2007. Even if presently the country is confronted with a long and difficult economic transition, it has a rich industrial and scientific history with many of the world&#x27;s priorities and still has surviving authentic traditional crafts and rural communities. Limited to some geographic areas and not yet on a large scale, by the means of European funds and projects, a sustainable revival of the traditional sector is supported, which also implies creative tourism participatory activities.

Against this big potential, there are relatively few entities, the majority being state owned, that are organizing, providing or permitting public visits, a main cause of this still being the weak implication and support of many public authorities. Meanwhile, the tourism stakeholders pay a relatively weak attention to the hard core of this niche (industrial heritage, technique, science and living industry), and practically there are not many package offers of this kind on the market, with some notable exceptions: ethnographic and wine tourism, also some rehabilitated industrial and forest narrow railways and steam engines still operating.

===Primary attractions===
According, an industrial and creative tourism attractions web directory for Romania and some neighbouring countries, providing photos and short English descriptions of each objective, the main attractions open to the public are:

* the national and regional technical and ethnographic museums: the Dimitrie Leonida National Technical Museum and the Aviation Museum in Bucharest, the mining museums in Brad, Petrosani, Rosia Montana, a technical museum in Iasi, the tram museum in Timișoara, the Oil Museum in Ploiesti, the astronomic observatories in Bucharest and Bacau, the village museums from Bucharest, Pitesti, Sibiu, Cluj, Timișoara, Valcea, Suceava; 
* the railway tourism on the recently rehabilitated narrow gauges from Brad, Abrud, Covasna, Moldovita, Agnita, Vaser, the Oravita – Anina mountain railway opened in 1864;
* the power plant museums from Cernavoda (nuclear), Iron Gates (hydro, on the Danube, 2200 MW, the biggest in European Union), Sadu (hydro, built in 1896), Sinaia (hydro, built in 1899), Grebla – Resita (hydro, built in 1904);
* factory tours: exception making some food (chocolate, soft drinks, yogurt) factories which provide visits for school children, there are no important companies (car, manufacturing, porcelain, textile, high technology, etc.) to promote such tourist visits. However, some reference enterprises may accept visits at special requests (the Resita Works, metallurgy, heavy machinery, founded in 1771, having a very interesting museum too, The Ruschita Marble Exploitation). A remarkable visit program, started in October 2013, offers the Timisoreana brewery, a factory founded in 1718, with very valuable heritage;
* industrial heritage: even if valuable, a large majority of the monuments are still abandoned by their owners. However, a few exceptions could be mentioned;
* motorsports: despite the missing of an international standard infrastructure like raceways, there are national federations organizing events for many categories and racing schools offering participatory courses;
* the salt mines from: Turda, Praid, Cacica, Slanic Prahova, Ocnele Mari, Ocna Sibiului (salt lakes) are equally famous for their tourism interest (museums, underground entertainment parks) as well as therapeutic exploitation (respiratory diseases)
* traditional crafts: wood carving, weaving, pottery, glass, embroidery. Many craftsmen preserved the traditions in some village areas from Moldavia, Transylvania and Oltenia. The majority are only selling their products on local markets, but they begin to organize and a few open their workshops to the tourists too;
* wineries: some vineyards have incredible landscapes and the wines produced here have a well established and long tradition. Wine tourism provides presentations of the technologies and the storage caves, and is well developed in Romania. Famous big wineries: Murfatlar, Cotnari, Dragasani, Recaș, Prahova Valley, Odobesti, Husi, Cricova (near Chisinau, in the Republic of Moldova, is huge, with about 80 kilometres of tunnels and caves)

==Infrastructure==
There are 16 international commercial airports in service today. Overall, airports in the country were transited in 2016 by 16.4 million passengers. The largest number of passengers was attracted by Bucharest&#x27;s Henri Coandă International Airport, which closed the year with a traffic of almost 11 million passengers.

Romania also has a large network of railways, CIA World Factbook lists Romania with the 22nd largest railway network in the world. The railway network is significantly interconnected with other European railway networks.

<text>Breda ( , , , ) is a city and municipality in the southern part of the Netherlands, located in the province of North Brabant. The name derived from &quot;brede Aa&quot; (&#x27;wide Aa&#x27; or &#x27;broad Aa&#x27;) and refers to the confluence of the rivers Mark and Aa. Breda has 
185,072 inhabitants on 13 September 2022 and is part of the Brabantse Stedenrij; it is the ninth largest city/municipality in the country, and the third largest in North Brabant after Eindhoven and Tilburg. It is equidistant from Rotterdam and Antwerp.

As a fortified city, it was of strategic military and political significance. Although a direct fiefdom of the Holy Roman Emperor, the city obtained a municipal charter; the acquisition of Breda, through marriage, by the House of Nassau ensured that Breda would be at the center of political and social life in the Low Countries. Breda had a population of in ; the metropolitan area had a population of .

==History==

In the 11th century, Breda was a direct fief of the Holy Roman Emperor, its earliest known lord being Henry of Brunesheim (1080–1125). The city of Breda obtained a municipal charter in 1252. After that Breda had the rights to build fortifications. The city constructed brick walls and Roman-style gates.

In 1327, Adelheid of Gaveren sold Breda to Duke Johannes III of Brabant. In 1350, the fief was resold to Johannes II of Wassenaar (d. 1377). In 1403, the heiress of his line, Johanna of Polanen (1392–1445), married Engelbert I of Nassau (1370–1442; his sarcophagus is in the Grote Kerk in Breda). Through her, the city came into the possession of the House of Nassau, where it remained until 1795, passing to William I of Orange (1533–1584), stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht and leader of the Dutch revolt. Thus, the baron of Breda was also Count of Nassau in the Holy Roman Empire, Prince of Orange, and (the main) stadtholder in the Dutch Republic (from 1572 to 1650, 1672–1702, 1747–1795). Breda remained part of the barony of Breda until it was captured by French revolutionary forces in 1795.

===Residence city===

The acquisition of the city by the House of Orange-Nassau marked its emergence as a &quot;residentiestad&quot; (residence city). The presence of the Orange-Nassau family attracted other nobles, who built palatial residences in the old quarters of the city. The most impressive one, built by the Italian architect Thomas Vincidor de Bologna for the first Dutch prince, was the first renaissance-style palace built north of the Alps. In the 15th century the city&#x27;s physical, economic and strategic importance expanded rapidly. A great church was built in Brabantine Gothic style with an elegant tower, called &quot;Grote Kerk&quot; (main church) or also &quot;Onze Lieve Vrouwe Kerk&quot; (Church of Our Lady). In 1534 Henry III of Nassau-Breda rebuilt the modest medieval fortifications in impressive style.

In 1534, a fire destroyed over nine tenths of the city, close to 1300 houses, churches, and chapels, and the town hall. Only 150 houses and the main church remained. In July 1581, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Breda was captured in a surprise attack and siege by Spanish troops then under the command of Claudius van Barlaymont, whose sobriquet was Haultpenne. Although the city had surrendered upon the condition that it would not be plundered, the troops vented their fury upon the inhabitants. In the resulting mayhem, known as &quot;Haultpenne&#x27;s Fury&quot;, over 500 citizens were killed. In March 1590, Breda fell back into the hands of the Dutch and Maurice of Nassau, when a 68 men hand-picked force, concealed under the turf of a peat-boat, had contrived to enter the city in a daring plan devised by Adriaen van Bergen, known as the ruse with the Peat Ship of Breda. Around 1610 the construction of the Spanish Gate or &quot;Spanjaardsgat&quot; was started as a remembrance to that successful action.

After a ten-month siege in 1624–25, the city again surrendered to the Spaniards, now led by Spinola; the event was immortalized by Diego Velázquez. In the Siege of Breda of 1637 the city was recaptured by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, after a four-month siege, and in 1648 it was finally ceded to the Dutch Republic by the Treaty of Westphalia.

In 1646, Frederick Henry founded the Orange College of Breda, modelled on Saumur, Geneva, and Oxford, intending it to train young men of good family for the army and the civil service.

===Stuart exiles===
The exiled Stuart Charles II of England resided in Breda for a little over a month of his time in exile during the Cromwellian Commonwealth and Protectorate, thanks to the proximity of Charles&#x27;s sister Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the widow of Prince William II of Orange (died 1702).

Based mostly on suggestions by the Parliamentarian General George Monck, Charles II&#x27;s Declaration of Breda (1660) announced his conditions for accepting the crown of England, which he was to regain a few months later in the year.

===Later history===
The Treaty of Breda was signed in the city on 31 July 1667, bringing to an end the Second Anglo-Dutch War in which the Dutch faced the same Charles II who had been their guest. Between 1746 and 1748 it was the site of the Congress of Breda, a series of talks between Britain and France aimed at bringing an end to the War of the Austrian Succession, which ultimately led to the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
During the Second World War, the city was under German occupation for over four years. During Operation Pheasant Breda was liberated following a successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by forces of 1st Polish Armoured Division of General Maczek on 28 October 1944. Each year during Liberation Day festivities, Breda is visited by a large Polish contingent and the city of Breda reserves a special portion of the festivities for the fallen Polish soldiers. A museum and a monument honoring Maczek and the Polish 1st Armoured Division stands in the city center. General Maczek and many soldiers of his division are buried in the nearby Polish military cemetery.

Breda was the site of one of the first panopticon prison establishments, Koepelgevangenis. This prison housed the only German war criminals ever to be imprisoned in the Netherlands for their war crimes during the Second World War. Known as &quot;The Breda Four&quot;, or &quot;Vier von Breda&quot;, they were Willy Paul Franz Lages, who was released in 1966 due to serious illness, Joseph Johann Kotalla, who died in prison in 1979, and Ferdinand aus der Fünten and Franz Fischer, who were both released in 1989 and died later the same year.

==Economy==

Historically, economic activities were mainly industrial. Breda was a center of the food- and drink industry. Companies like Hero (lemonade), Van Melle (Mentos), De Faam (liquorice) and Kwatta (chocolate) are famous throughout Western Europe. Breda also had a sugar factory, supplying its best-known products.

Breda formerly housed the largest brewery in the Netherlands (Oranjeboom). The multinational Interbrew took over the brewery in 1995 and then closed it in 2004. Production of the &quot;Breda&quot; brand was moved to both Bremen and Leuven until 2008, when Randalls Brewery (in Guernsey) acquired the licence. Guernsey is now the only place in the world where draught Breda is brewed.

However, the decline of industrial activity did not harm the city&#x27;s economy. Nowadays, Breda is a service oriented economy based on business, trade and logistics. A growing number of international companies choose to establish their head office for Benelux operations and manufacturing in Breda. Examples of these companies are 3M Abbott Laboratories, Alfa Laval, Amgen, Dockwise, ExxonMobil, General Electric, General Motors, Krohne Oil &amp; Gas, Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, Scania, Texaco, and Toshiba. Also, the food industry is still largely represented by companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Hero Group, Perfetti Van Melle and . Furthermore, the city is host to the headquarters of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Because of its central location between the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, the city also attracts logistics companies such as Van Wijngen International. Koch Media has its Benelux office in Breda.

The main shopping areas of Breda are the city center and the southern part of Breda. Known shopping centers are De Barones and &#x27;t Sas. Major shopping streets are the Eindstraat, , Wilhelminastraat and Ginnekenweg. A market is held on the Grote Markt every Tuesday and Friday from 09:00 to 13:00. A book and antique market is held on Wednesday from 09:00 to 17:00.

==Education==
Breda became since 1970 a more specific &quot;education city&quot; and &quot;student city&quot;. In 2012 there were 27,000 students registered in Middelbaar- and Hoger Onderwijs.

Secondary education consists of;
*vmbo – Pre-vocational secondary education
*vmbo-theoretical or mavo – secondary general continued education

<text>Mysore Zoo (or Mysuru Zoo), officially known as Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, is a composite of zoological gardens and animal park located in the southern Indian city of Mysore, Karnataka. Stretching across a -expanse and situated at about 700 metres (0.43 miles) from Mysore Palace, it is the oldest zoo in India and one of the oldest in the world. One of the most popular zoos in India and one of the city&#x27;s most popular attractions, it is home to a wide range of over 168 species.

== History ==
Mysore Zoo was created from the private menagerie of Chamaraja Wadiyar X, the twenty-third Maharaja of Mysore. in 1892, on of the Summer Palace. Over the next 10 years, the zoo was expanded to with spacious enclosures that are still in use.

Originally called the Palace Zoo, it was renamed &quot;Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens&quot; in 1909. A.C. Hughes, from South Wales, was the zoo&#x27;s first superintendent, serving from 1892 to 1924. Hughes, Sir Mirza Ismail, and G.H. Krumbiegel worked towards refashioning the zoo and updating it with modern, natural enclosures. It now features a bandstand and an artificial lake.

In 1948, management of the zoo was devolved to the Department of Parks and Gardens, Government of Mysore. The zoo was expanded first with another , and then another with the acquisition of the Karanji Tank, in which an artificial island has been created as a sanctuary for birds. In 1972, the zoo was entrusted the Forest Department and later in 1979 to the Zoo Authority of Karnataka, the first autonomous organisation in India to manage a zoo.

The zoo had completed 100 years in 1992. The centenary celebrations were held in 1990 and 91. During the centenary celebrations various developmental activities were initiated such as renovation and modification of the entrance gate, hospital building, walkthrough reptiles, &quot;etc&quot;. A bust of Chamaraja Wadiyar X was unveiled. The logo of the zoo, centenary souvenir, publication of literature and leaflets, conducting various competitions, preparation of a documentary film were other highlights.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of Mysore Zoo are as under:
* Conservation education
* Conservation breeding
* Research, documentation and study
* Rescue and rehabilitation of the wild animals and birds
* Recreation and education for general visitors, tourist &amp; locals

== Management and lands holdings ==
While mainly depending on entry fees for its financing, an adoption scheme introduced in the early 2000s has been a success. Celebrities, institutions, animal lovers and volunteers of various clubs in the zoo have contributed directly to the welfare of the zoo inhabitants.

=== Lands under the control of Mysore Zoo ===
* Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, Mysore.
* Karanji Lake Nature Park, Mysore.
* Chamundi Conservation and Rehabilitation Center, Kurugahalli, Mysore.

== Karanji Lake ==
The Karanji Lake which covers is located on the eastern side of the zoo. The Chamundi Hills acts as catchment and provides a dramatic backdrop.

Previously the tank was almost a garbage dump being used by all and sundry for each and every function. There was no bird life but for scavengers, crows, and the entire area was a slum. As such it was in constant danger of being taken over by developers for real estate development. The tank was handed to Mysore Zoo in March 1976 by public works department for development and maintenance. The tank is situated on north-east side of Mysore city. It functions as a percolation tank. After the protection and afforestation in the foreshore area, the tank started attracting a variety of birds for breeding &amp; nesting activities. Restoration and development activities were taken up under the Asian Development Bank project through Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation to the extent of Rs.1.17 crores.

About of prime zoo land has been donated to the Natural History Museum, which will enhance the educational potential of the zoo by offering people a rare opportunity to study natural history of wild animals, aquatic birds and tropical vegetation, etc.

== Animals ==

The zoo is currently home to ten elephants, and has more elephants than any other zoo in India. A total of 34 elephants have lived at this zoo, many of which were eventually transferred to other zoos in Mysore. The zoo also has five green anacondas, contributed by Colombo Zoo. It is also the only zoo in India to house chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, white rhinos and cheetahs.

Some of the animals housed in the Mysore Zoo include:

== Incidents ==

The zoo witnessed a series of animal deaths in 2004 and 2005. In August 2004, a lion-tailed macaque was found mysteriously dead. An emu and a tiger were also reported to have died mysteriously. On 4 September 2004, an elephant died, reportedly of acute haemorrhagic enteritis and respiratory distress. It was reported that the illness in elephants was due to poisoning. As a safety measure, the zoo authority suspended several staff members who were allegedly responsible for the &quot;gruesome killings&quot;. Laboratory tests later confirmed that the two elephants, named Ganesha and Roopa, had been poisoned. This was followed by another elephant death (Komala) on 7 September despite heightened security. Komala had been scheduled to be transferred to Armenia in about a month.

On 24 October 2005 another elephant, Rohan along with his mate Ansul, died with suspicions of poisoning. The elephants were supposed to be sent to Armenia as a goodwill gesture. The Chief Minister of Karnataka immediately ordered a probe into the death of Ansul and Rohan.

4 January 2017, the zoo announced that it was hit by avian influenza. Lab reports confirmed that six free-ranging and migratory birds died due to avian influenza (H5N8) in late December. The monthlong closure is the longest for the 124-year-old Mysore Zoo

<text>Transmission security (TRANSEC) is the component of communications security (COMSEC) that results from the application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis. Goals of transmission security include:

* Low probability of interception (LPI)
* Low probability of detection (LPD)
* Antijam — resistance to jamming (EPM or ECCM)
This involves securing communication links from being compromised by techniques like jamming, eavesdropping, and signal interception. TRANSEC includes the use of frequency hopping, spread spectrum and the physical protection of communication links to obscure the patterns of transmission. It is particularly vital in military and government communication systems, where the security of transmitted data is critical to prevent adversaries from gathering intelligence or disrupting operations. TRANSEC is often implemented alongside COMSEC (Communications Security) to form a comprehensive approach to communication security.

Methods used to achieve transmission security include frequency hopping and spread spectrum where the required pseudorandom sequence generation is controlled by a cryptographic algorithm and key. Such keys are known as transmission security keys (TSK). Modern U.S. and NATO TRANSEC-equipped radios include SINCGARS and HAVE QUICK.

<text>Kročehlavy is a municipal part of the city of Kladno, Czech Republic. It has about 35,000 inhabitants.

In history, Kročehlavy was a stand-alone village. The first mention of Kročehlavy, dating back to 1316, is found in local records relating to a member of lower Czech nobility, Zdeněk Kladenský from Kladno.

Prior to the 19th century, the population Kročehlavy was about 130 people. After the growth of coal mining and metallurgic industry the population soared multiple times. Kročehlavy was first merged with Kladno in 1938, which lasted for a few years. They merged again in 1948 and remain so to this day.

<doc id="1098309" wikidata="Q649847" url="?curid=1098309" title="Bezant">
<text>In the Middle Ages, the term bezant (, from Latin ) was used in Western Europe to describe several gold coins of the east, all derived ultimately from the Roman. The word itself comes from the Greek Byzantion, the ancient name of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

The original &quot;bezants&quot; were the gold coins produced by the government of the Byzantine Empire, first the and from the 11th century the . Later, the term was used to cover the gold dinars produced by Islamic governments. In turn, the gold coins minted in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and County of Tripoli were termed &quot;Saracen bezants&quot; (), or &quot;fake dinars&quot; (), since they were modelled on the Fatimid dinar. A completely different electrum coin based on Byzantine was minted in the Kingdom of Cyprus and called the &quot;white bezant&quot;.

The term &quot;bezant&quot; in reference to coins is common in sources from the 10th through 13th centuries. Thereafter, it was mainly employed as a money of account and in literary and heraldic contexts.

==Medieval history==
Gold coins were rarely minted in early medieval Western Europe, up until the later 13th century; silver and bronze were the metals of choice for money. Gold coins were almost continually produced by the Byzantines and medieval Arabs. These circulated in Western European trade in smallish numbers, originating from the coinage mints of the Eastern Mediterranean. In Western Europe, the gold coins of Byzantine currency were highly prized. These gold coins were commonly called bezants. The first &quot;bezants&quot; were the Byzantine &quot;solidi&quot; coins; later, the name was applied to the &quot;hyperpyra&quot;, which replaced the &quot;solidi&quot; in Constantinople in the late 11th century. The name &quot;hyperpyron&quot; was used by the late medieval Greeks, while the name bezant was used by the late medieval Latin merchants for the same coin. The Italians also used the name &quot;perpero&quot; or &quot;pipero&quot; for the same coin (an abridgement of the name &quot;hyperpyron&quot;).

Medievally from the 12th century onward (if not earlier), the Western European term bezant also meant the gold dinar coins minted by Islamic governments. The Islamic coins were originally modelled on the Byzantine &quot;solidus&quot; during the early years after the onset of Islam. The term bezant was used in the late medieval Republic of Venice to refer to the Egyptian gold dinar. Marco Polo used the term bezant in the account of his travels to East Asia when describing the currencies of the Yuan Empire around the year 1300. An Italian merchant&#x27;s handbook dated about 1340, &quot;Pratica della mercatura&quot; by Pegolotti, used the term &quot;bisant&quot; for coins of North Africa (including Tunis and Tripoli), Cyprus, Armenia and Tabriz (in today&#x27;s northwestern Iran), whereas it used the term &quot;perpero&quot; / &quot;pipero&quot; for the Byzantine bizant.

Although the medieval &quot;bezant&quot; usually referred to a gold coin, some medieval Latin texts have been noted to expand its usage to cover silver coins. These silver bezants were often called &quot;white bezants&quot;. Occasionally in Latin they were also called &quot;miliaresion bezants&quot; / &quot;miliarense bezants&quot;. Like the gold bezants, the silver bezants by definition were issuances by the Byzantine government or by an Arabic government, and not by a Latin government, and the usage of the term was confined to the Latin West.

==Bezants in heraldry==
In heraldry, a roundel of a gold colour is referred to as a &quot;bezant&quot;, in reference to the coin. Like many heraldic charges, the &quot;bezant&quot; originated during the crusading era, when Western European knights first came into contact with Byzantine gold coins, and were perhaps struck with their fine quality and purity. During the Fourth Crusade the city of Constantinople was sacked by Western forces. During this sacking of the richest city of Europe, the gold &quot;bezant&quot; would have been very much in evidence, many of the knights no doubt having helped themselves very liberally to the booty. This event took place at the very dawn of the widespread adoption of arms by the knightly class, and thus it may have been an obvious symbol for many returned crusaders to use in their new arms. When arms are strewn with bezants, the term &quot;bezantée&quot; or &quot;bezanty&quot; is used.

<text>The Samajwadi Krantikari Sena (Socialist Revolutionary Army) was a political organisation and private army that operated in Saharsa district of Bihar in India. It was founded in 1980 by Anand Mohan Singh and was dominated by members of the Rajput caste who formed part of the feudal elite of Saharsa district and surrounding areas but were reduced to subordinate position due to political condition of period following the implementation Mandal Commission due to spur of some rising backward castes in politics. 

The Samajwadi Krantikari Sena was part of a wave of caste-based militias that were formed in Bihar during the 1970s onwards.
The group claimed that its aim was to fight against the reservation policies that it believed to be as bad as the divide-and-rule policies of the British Raj. The prime objective of the Sena was to work against reservation quotas for any caste. The group, along with its leader, has also been implicated in several politically-motivated murders.

The sena primarily worked to suppress the voices of dissent from the backward communities after the Mandal politics began in 1990 and reservation for the socially and educationally backward castes was implemented. In order to suppress the supporters of Mandal Commission and to take on growing challenge to their superiority from newly emerging powerful communities from the backward caste in the caste conscious state of Bihar, the Rajputs rallied around the Sena.

However; Pappu Yadav a close associate of Lalu Prasad Yadav formed his own outfit called Mandal Sena to pose a formidable challenge to the aspirations of the Samajwadi Krantikari Sena and its leader Anand Mohan Singh. The clashes between Yadav&#x27;s outfit with those dominated by upper castes and the action of Yadav&#x27;s private army in retaliation against the upper castes in the Kosi region, turned the area into a crime zone.

<doc id="1098319" wikidata="Q2775608" url="?curid=1098319" title="White Hart Lane railway station">
<text>White Hart Lane is a station on the Weaver line of the London Overground, located in Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey in North London. It is from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and stations. It is in Travelcard zone 3. The station is close to Bruce Grove and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the home ground of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

==History==
White Hart Lane was originally a stop on the Stoke Newington &amp; Edmonton Railway line (part of Great Eastern Railway) which opened on 22 July 1872. The station was named after the local road on which it is sited – White Hart Lane (the road probably acquired its name in the 17th century but part of it existed earlier as Apeland Street), and it was once the location of a spring called Bishop&#x27;s Well. The area was semi-rural before the arrival of railway with some villas and other buildings along Tottenham High Road, and the opening of the station drew increasing population to the area, which then developed to become more urban. The line was extended to Enfield, and within a few years 4 trains per hour was running from Liverpool Street to Enfield, more at peak hours, with two reversing at White Hart Lane. It was also linked to Cheshunt in October 1891, initially with services that ran only between White Hart Lane and Cheshunt. In addition to the passenger service, there were also freight facilities on the up side with a refuge siding on the opposite side until 1968.

The original station building built in 1872 is a two-storey brick structure. The White Hart Lane football stadium (which had the same name as the station) opened in 1899 and the station became a point of arrival for fans attending matches at the stadium. As attendance increased, wide exit doors were provided to cope with the 10,000-strong crowds that passed through the station to the stadium on match days. At its busiest, train were running at intervals of under five minutes, the maximum possible with steam trains. In 1961, after the line had been electrified, trains from Liverpool Street were running at intervals of four minutes at its peak on match days, with additional trains from and .
In 1957, a scheme was initiated to raise the railway bridge over the adjoining road White Hart Lane by so that double-decker buses may pass under. This required substantial alterations to the platforms and lifting of the tracks which was completed in 1958. The work was one of the schemes undertaken in preparation for the electrification of the line. In 1962, a new entrance was added at the station for football fans returning after matches.

In 1978, a fire caused some damage to old station, and a new ticket office was built to the north of the original Victorian building. The entrance frontage beside the road of White Hart Lane dates from this period. New staircases were also constructed on both sides of the exteriors of the platforms for passengers&#x27; access.

The Provisional IRA planted a small bomb at the station on 1 March 1992, which coincided with a League Cup semi-final match against Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane. The match was delayed while the device was made safe.

Today, the station and services that call are operated by the Weaver line of the London Overground, which took over from Abellio Greater Anglia in May 2015. At that time, the station was added to the Tube map.

===Rebuilding===

As part of the Northumberland Development Project to redevelop the White Hart Lane stadium and regenerate the area the station was also selected to be upgraded. This involved the building of a new ticket hall to the south of the original station building on Love Lane to create a better connection with Tottenham High Road, and an additional entrance on Penshurst Road as well as two lifts for step-free access to ease the bottlenecking of fans on match day. There is also additional new cycle parking. The rebuilding, which was undertaken by Taylor Woodrow Construction, was originally scheduled to start in autumn 2017 and finish in spring 2019 but was delayed. The new entrance to the station was opened on 26 August 2019.

Discussions were reported in 2019 regarding a proposal that the station could be renamed &quot;Tottenham Hotspur&quot;.

==Tottenham Hotspur matches==
On days that see football matches at Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s ground nearby the station sees increased usage. A special timetable operates on match days, with trains arriving and departing every two to three minutes before and after the game. There is an increase in the number of trains to and from the line&#x27;s termini at and , as well as starting and terminating White Hart Lane trains and services to and from and Liverpool Street.

Historically, additional match-day services also connected to the Gospel Oak to Barking line and to from .

==Services==

All services at White Hart Lane are operated as part of the Weaver line of the London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Liverpool Street
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, and on matchdays at the nearby Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

== Connections ==
London Buses routes 149, 259, 279, 349, W3 and night route N279 serve the station.

<doc id="1098322" wikidata="Q6954125" url="?curid=1098322" title="NHS Direct">
<text>NHS Direct was the health advice and information service provided by the National Health Service (NHS), established in March 1998. The nurse-led telephone information service provided residents and visitors in England with healthcare advice 24 hours a day, every day of the year through telephone contact on the national non-geographic 0845 46 47 number. The programme also provided a web based symptom checkers on the NHS Direct website and via mobile, both as apps for iPhone and Android smart phones and a mobile website.

It was discontinued on 31 March 2014 and replaced by NHS 111. As a part of the National Health Service, NHS Direct services were free, although the 0845 number was usually chargeable as a non-geographic number. Some landline providers allowed 0845 calls within &quot;inclusive&quot; minutes.

Users of the service, through whichever channel, were asked questions about their symptoms or problem. Common problems were often given simple self care advice, which they could follow, thereby avoiding an expensive visit to a health care professional. More complex problems were assessed by a nurse and could then be given treatment advice or referred on to another service within the NHS.

As well as these core services, NHS Direct provided a number of commissioned services throughout the NHS, such as specialised support for patients with long term conditions, access to GP and dental healthcare out of hours, and a professional response system for times of public health anxiety.

NHS Direct only provided its service for residents and visitors in England, and there are corresponding public services covering Scotland (NHS 24) and Wales (NHS Direct Wales). Northern Ireland does not have such a service.

==Health and symptomatic advice==
NHS Direct&#x27;s core service was the provision of health advice to the public through the national telephone service or through digital channels including the website.

===Telephone service===
In England and Wales, the NHS Direct telephone service was available on 0845 46 47 and was run by a specially trained team of information handlers and healthcare professionals, including nurses and dental nurses. The service was equipped to deal with a huge range of health enquiries, from symptomatic queries that require assessment and treatment, to requests for local healthcare services and healthy living advice.

Every person that called NHS Direct feeling unwell was assessed to establish the severity of their symptoms, so as to re-route any urgent or life-threatening situations to the emergency services as quickly as possible.

Other symptomatic callers were able to speak to a nurse practitioner, who asked about their condition in order to recommend the best course of action. This could be giving advice about treating the problem at home, suggesting a visit to a pharmacist, or advising an appointment with their GP, which, if in the out of hours period (when the GP surgeries are closed), could possibly be arranged over the phone.

As many callers were advised to look after their symptoms at home without seeing their GP, the NHS Direct telephone service reduced the demand on NHS resources and helped to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor, dentist and accident and emergency department.

The NHS Direct telephone service also provided a confidential interpreter service in many different languages, which could be accessed by stating the language required when the call was answered. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, there was a textphone service available on 0845 606 4647.

===Website===
The NHS Direct website had a variety of symptom checkers, based on the same system used on the telephone service and could either give self care advice or direct a user to another NHS service. For more complex queries, the symptom checkers allowed the user to receive a call back from a nurse or to take part in a webchat for further information and help.

All NHS Direct health advice and information on the website passed through a rigorous clinical check by medical professionals before it was published.

Non-urgent health queries could be submitted to the NHS Direct online enquiry service and the website also offered a confidential webchat service for those needing advice about unprotected sex or emergency contraception.

===Mobile services===
NHS Direct offered its full range of symptom checkers optimised for mobile devices on its mobile website and also launched stand alone &#x27;apps&#x27; for iPhone and Android smart phones, both available in the normal app stores.

==Other services==
===Digital television channel===
NHS Direct provided an interactive TV service via Sky Interactive until 31 March 2009, when the service was closed.

The Freeview service, on channel 100 is now hosted by NHS Choices.

The digital television service contained condensed versions of many of the most common and popular health encyclopedia topics and common health questions.

===Commissioned services===
Although it is not well known, NHS Direct supplies a multitude of additional commissioned services within the NHS.

NHS Direct supported many local health authorities in England, including primary care trusts (PCTs), helping them to deliver high-quality healthcare to people in each region.

These services ranged from dedicated projects in particular areas, such as the local telephone helpline set up for Sandwell PCT after a dental health scare, to schemes that were developed nationwide. These include a telephone-based pre and post-operative assessment for patients having surgery, and allocating care managers to give regular coaching and advice to those with long term conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

==History and background==
NHS Direct was launched in 1998 after the government identified a need for a telephone health advice line staffed by nurses as part of its plans to modernise the NHS.

The aim of NHS Direct, as stated by the government in the NHS White Paper, &quot;The New NHS&quot;, was &quot;to provide people at home with easier and faster advice and information about health, illness, and the NHS, so that they are better able to care for themselves and their families&quot;.

The NHS Direct telephone service began taking calls in three contact centres in Lancashire, Northumbria and Milton Keynes in March 1998. These original sites were set up as pilots but soon proved successful, reaching over 1 million people and earning highly positive feedback. Additional waves of pilots were established in contact centres around England until the whole country was covered by the NHS Direct telephone service in 2000.

NHS Direct added a website to its services at the end of 1999, allowing users to find clinically accurate health advice and information anonymously. Since its creation, the NHS Direct website was steadily improved and developed, attracting more users. By 2008, there were over 1.5 million visitors to the website every month. NHS Direct&#x27;s services continued to expand and improve. It had been said that this has made the organisation &quot;the largest and most successful healthcare provider of its kind, anywhere in the world&quot;.

It was reported that each call made to NHS Direct cost £25 to answer - an earlier official report had put the total at £16.

In April 2007, NHS Direct became an NHS Trust, giving it the opportunity to apply for foundation trust status.

In August 2010, the BBC reported that David Cameron&#x27;s coalition government was planning to scrap the NHS Direct 0845 46 47 helpline telephone service in favour of the cheaper NHS 111 number. This intention was set out in the white paper, but was portrayed in the media as a &#x27;leak&#x27; by the Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. The service was shut down on 26 March 2014. A copy of the website was archived a few weeks before the official closedown.

==Replacement in England==
It was announced in October 2013 that NHS Direct would be closed down in 2014, following three pilots in the North East, East Midlands and East of England. NHS 111 was intended to work in an integrated way with local GPs, out-of-hours services, ambulance services and hospitals, for the benefit of patients and to help the NHS become more efficient. NHS Direct was intended to have an ongoing role, along with other providers, in helping to deliver the NHS 111 Service and, in the interim, continued providing local and national telephone and web-based services on behalf of its commissioners. after the organisation became entangled in and failed to deliver correctly a number of contracts to deliver NHS 111.

<text>Olegas Truchanas (22 September 1923 – 6 January 1972) was a Lithuanian-Australian conservationist and nature photographer.

He was a key figure in the attempt to stop the damming of the ecologically sensitive Lake Pedder in South West Tasmania by the Hydro Electricity Commission. His photographs, along with those of his protégé, Peter Dombrovskis, helped raise public awareness of the importance of the south-west Tasmania.

==Early life==
Truchanas was born in Šiauliai, Lithuania. In 1941, he graduated from the Šiauliai Gymnasium. After the 1945 fall of Lithuania to the USSR, he fled to Munich, Germany. Though he enrolled in a law degree at UNRRA University, he was sent to a displaced persons camp and subsequently migrated to Tasmania in 1948.

Upon arriving in Tasmania, Truchanas worked for a zinc company in Hobart for two years, which was necessary under Australian migration law of the time. During that time, he began to take an interest in the Tasmanian wilderness.

==South West Tasmania==
In 1958, Truchanas became the first person in recorded history to kayak the length of the dangerous Serpentine and Gordon Splits.

Most of Truchanas&#x27; early photographs were lost when his house was destroyed in the Hobart bushfire in 1967. However, over the next five years, he substantially rebuilt his collection of photos of the Lake Pedder area. As a clerk temporarily employed by the Hydro Electricity Commission, Truchanas was forbidden to speak about the increasing controversy surrounding the impending damming. His photographs played an important role in the publicity of the campaign. He was once quoted as stating &quot;This vanishing world is beautiful beyond our dreams and contains in itself rewards and gratifications never found in an artificial landscape or man-made objects.&quot;

After taking what is now among the only remaining records of the pre-dam era Lake Pedder, Truchanas realised that the campaign was lost. He turned his attention to the Pieman, Gordon and Franklin Rivers. In 1972, Truchanas drowned in the Gordon River after he slipped and fell into the current. His body was found by Dombrovskis, trapped beneath a log.

==Legacy==
He lived to see the failure of the Lake Pedder and Pieman River campaigns although the actual damming did not occur until after his death. The campaign to stop the Franklin Dam and thus save the Gordon and Franklin rivers, was ultimately successful. After his death, a book with his work was published. With an initial print of 5,000 copies, eight further editions sold out.

Truchanas&#x27; and Dombrovskis&#x27; stories were depicted in a 2003 documentary, &quot;Wildness&quot;. In the same year a tribute, &quot;The Forest of Stumps&quot; by artist Geoff Parr, was exhibited at Hobart&#x27;s &quot;Ten Days on the Island&quot; arts festival. It included a number of Truchanas&#x27; photographs.

Some of his photographs have been turned into postage stamps by Australia Post. A canoe used by Truchanas, and several other possessions, is part of the National Library of Australia&#x27;s National Historical Collection. Singer-songwriter Bruce Watson wrote in his song &quot;Olegas&quot;, &quot;the Franklin runs today because of what [Truchanas] began.&quot;

In 2007 IHOS Music Theatre and Opera staged excerpts from a major opera, &quot;Olegas&quot;, based on the life of Olegas Truchanas. His work appeared in the 2013 photographic exhibition Into the Wild: Wilderness Photography in Tasmania at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston, Tasmania and in the catalogue of this exhibition. His collection of colour slides, as well as an archival collection, was donated to the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in 2014. His work also appeared in the 2020 QVMAG exhibition Natural Visions: the camera and conservation.

<text>Moritz Johann Bleibtreu ( is a German film actor, voice actor, and film director. He has been a successful actor in many movies such as &quot;Run Lola Run, Das Experiment, The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot;, and &quot;Elementary Particles&quot;. His role in &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; was the one that set off his career in 1997.

==Life==
Moritz Bleibtreu was born in 1971 and was raised in the St. Georg district of Hamburg. Moritz Bleibtreu&#x27;s parents, Monica Bleibtreu, (1944–2009) and, Hans Brenner, (1938–1998) were both actors. Renato Attilio Bleibtreu is Moritz&#x27;s grandfather and is a well-known writer. Many of his ancestors were actors also, such as his great-grandmother Maximiliane Bleibtreu, her sister Hedwig Bleibtreu and their parents Amalie and Sigmund Bleibtreu. Actress Cilli Drexel is the half-sister of Moritz Bleibtreu. The Bleibtreustrasse, a street in Berlin, was originally named after Georg Bleibtreu who was a battle painter and a distant ancestor of Moritz. Moritz as a child was already in the spotlight when he starred in &quot;Neues aus Uhlenbusch&quot; (&quot;News From Uhlenbusch).&quot; The children series was written by Rainer Boldt, Monica Bleibtreu, and Hans Peter Korff. Monica and Hans were married at the time this series was produced. Bleibtreu&#x27;s career continued to grow as he got a role in Boldt&#x27;s, &quot;I Had a Dream&quot;, and then in 1986 in, &quot;With My Hot Tears&quot;, a television series that he acted in with his mother. 

Moritz Bleibtreu grew up attending the Jahnschule, which is now known as the Ida-Ehre-School in Hamburg-Harvestehude. He obtained his secondary school certificate in the eleventh grade while attending the school. He then began to not attend the school anymore after obtaining his certificate. Bleibtreu then moved to Paris to work as an Au-Pair for almost two years. While working this job, he was also able to learn French. He then moved to Italy afterwards for a year and then on to New York. In New York, he attended acting school. He was not offered a job in his audition at the Actors Studio, but he was able to get on as a factotum, which let him observe the actors&#x27; rehearsals.

Moritz Bleibtreu had a son in November 2008 with his now ex-wife Annika in Reinbek, Germany.

He married Saskia de Tschaschell in Reinbek at the Maria-Magdelenen Church on 21 July 2022.

== Career ==
At the age of 21 and after 4 years of studying abroad, Bleibtreu continued his career by working at the Thalia Theater and the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, Germany. After this, he began getting smaller roles in television series. Moritz Bleibtreu began his television acting career in 1993 with a role in the series &quot;Schulz &amp; Schulz.&quot; Bleibtreu took a role in &quot;&quot; (1994) as a gay bartender named Thorsten who lives in the Hamburg prostitute scene. In the show, he helps a 16-year-old boy with a predicament with his father. They seek to prove his father&#x27;s innocence after he is convicted of killing a young man who resided in the red-light district in Hamburg. Bleibtreu also starred in a romantic comedy called &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; (1995). He played the role of Karl, a homosexual naive carpenter.

In 1998, Moritz began to step away from acting in T.V. series and began to work on more movies. He said, &quot;cinema is an active form of watching, while television is a passive one&quot;. Bleibtreu has worked in many well-known films such as &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot;, and &quot;The Experiment&quot;. He also worked on many other films such as &quot;Solino&quot;, &quot;im Juli&quot;, &quot;Chiko&quot;, and &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; in which he worked with filmmaker Fatih Akin. Moritz won the German Film Award for best leading actor in the films &quot;im Juli&quot; and &quot;The Experiment&quot;. In 2003, he was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. Bleibtreu also worked in many films as a voice actor. In 2004 and 2006, he was a voice actor in the film &quot;Brother Bear&quot; and &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot; which were both produced by Walt Disney Studios. He was also awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actor in 2006 for his role in &quot;Elementary Particles&quot; directed by Oskar Roehler. He also enjoys taking smaller supporting roles in international co-productions. One movie that he worked in was Sam Barbarski&#x27;s &quot;Vijay and I&quot;. Bleibtreu, back in 2004, played a role in the Danish film &quot;Der Fakir&quot; and then in 2016 in Johannes Naber&#x27;s film adaptation of Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;. Finally, in February 2015, he stepped back into the TV production spotlight after 17 years. He started acting in the ZDF crime series called &quot;Schuld&quot;. The TV series was based on Ferdinand von Schriach. Bleibtreu played the role of Friedrich Kronberg, a criminal defense lawyer, for three seasons. Following wide positive feedback by fans on his Facebook page whether there should be a sequel to the 2001 classic German stoner film &quot;Lammbock&quot;, Bleibtreu announced in November 2015 that the sequel would be titled &quot;Lommbock&quot;. Filming began in summer 2016 and the film premiered in 2017. He played a main role in the musical adaptation, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been to New York&quot;, which was first shown in cinemas in Germany in October 2019. He worked alongside a couple other famous actors and actresses such as Katharina Thalbach, Heike Makatsch, and Uwe Ochsenknecht in movies such as I&#x27;ve Never Been to New York and Love Your Neighbour. Bleibtreu then began his journey as a director in September 2020 with his film &quot;&quot;Cortex&quot;&quot;. He premiered his film at the Hamburg Film Festival in October 2020. The next year he worked in a six-part RTL drama series called &quot;Faking Hitler&quot;.

== Directing career ==
Moritz Bleibtreu began his career in directing in 2019 with his film Cortex which released in theaters on 22 October 2020. He said, in an interview with the German Films Quarterly, that the film was &quot;very personal to him&quot; as he directed the psychological thriller. Bleibtreu exclaimed that the motivation behind him directing his film was that &quot;... he believed he wanted to watch a film like this himself&quot;. He also said that &quot;directing was not an escape from acting, but rather just another challenge for his journey&quot;. Not only did Bleibtreu direct the film, but he also played the lead role of a security officer named Hagen. According to IMDb with 540 viewer ratings, Cortex received a 5.3 out of 10 stars. German film critic, Christopher Diekhaus, said in a review that &quot;Bleibtreu finds his own way to challenge and captivate the audience&quot;. He also says it &quot;creates an abysmal pull and makes you want to watch it several times to better understand the dance between dream and reality&quot;.

== Controversy ==
Bleibtreu decided in April 2021 to join the #allesdichtmachen campaign. This campaign was meant for people to give advice or measures that they would take to stop COVID-19 from spreading. There were about 50 other actors along with Bleibtreu that joined in on this movement. When an advertising partner decided to step in and talk to him about how this could affect his career and future, he decided it was best to not send out the video that he made for the campaign.

<doc id="1098342" wikidata="Q3141607" url="?curid=1098342" title="Thomas Bodström">
<text>Thomas Lennart Bodström (born 9 April 1962) is a Swedish former politician of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. He is also a former footballer, and is best remembered for representing Allsvenskan side AIK between 1987 and 1989.

== Political career ==
Thomas Bodström was the Swedish Minister for Justice in the two last succeeding governments of the Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, from 2000 to 2006. From October 2006 until October 2010, he was the chairman of the Riksdag committee for judicial issues. When the new parliament, that was elected in 2010, was inaugurated, Bodström lost his position as a committee chairman. Bodström shortly afterwards requested half-time leave of absence from his seat in the parliament, combined with half-time parental leave, in order to relocate to the USA together with his family. His request for leave of absence was denied by the Social Democratic group leader in the parliament, and Bodström has thus left his seat in the Parliament. His part-time parental leave was already granted from the Swedish Social Insurance Administration. Thomas Bodström is also active as the chairman of the children&#x27;s rights organization ECPAT Sweden.

Thomas Bodström is the son of Lennart Bodström, who was Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1982 to 1985 in the Olof Palme government. In his youth, however, Thomas Bodström was not involved in party politics. Instead, his first brush with media attention came as a football player in AIK, a team in the Premier Division of the Swedish Football league, 1987–1989. In 1990, he graduated from Stockholm University with a Degree of Master of Laws, LL.M. After that, he worked as a lawyer for ten years. During his career, he took interest in international affairs, and in 1999, he joined the board of the Swedish branch of the international organisation Lawyers Without Borders.

However, when Prime Minister Göran Persson announced his new cabinet appointment on 11 October 2000, Bodström was a completely unknown face to most of the political journalists attending the press conference. At the time, he was not even a member of the Social Democratic Party. Although Bodström was unaccustomed to national politics at the time, he has managed to keep his job, despite calls for his resignation, especially loudly voiced after several high-profile prison breaks during the summer of 2004.

He has written a book, &quot;700 dagar i Rosenbad&quot; (700 days in Rosenbad), about his experiences as a newcomer in the government.

==Controversy==
At the time of his appointment, Bodström revealed in an interview that he had used hashish in his youth, and also, that he on several occasions had employed a person in his home without paying the appropriate taxes.

During his term in office, Bodström was heavily criticized by advocates of privacy and liberal think tanks, as he is said to have worked towards giving the police the possibility of monitoring people who might be involved in minor crimes, as well as other things that could be seen as intrusive to privacy.

On 23 August 2010, during an interview by Swedish Radio, in light of the current drug testing debate, the reporter asked Bodström if he was willing to participate in a drug test. Bodström at first agreed, but when the nurse explained that he would be tested for amphetamines, hashish, opiates, and benzodiazepines, he changed his mind, and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like doing it now. I am sweating too much.&quot;

The Pirate Party defended his right not to take the test in reference to their views on privacy.

Since mid-2011, Bodström has been an expert commentator on law on the crime reality TV show &quot;Efterlyst&quot; on TV3.

==Football career==
Bodström played professional football in the 1980s as a defender and represented Allsvenskan club AIK between 1987 and 1989, making a total of 48 league appearances and scoring three goals for the club. Prior to representing AIK, he also played for Spånga IS and Enköpings SK FK.

<doc id="1098346" wikidata="Q220244" url="?curid=1098346" title="Sanakht">
<text>Sanakht (also read as Hor-Sanakht) is the Horus name of an ancient Egyptian king (pharaoh) of the Third Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. His chronological position is highly uncertain (though he is more likely to have reigned towards the end of the dynasty), and it is also unclear under which Hellenized name the ancient historian Manetho could have listed him. Many Egyptologists connect Sanakht with the Ramesside cartouche name &quot;Nebka&quot;. However, this remains disputed because no further royal title of that king has ever been found; either in contemporary source or later ones. There are two relief fragments depicting Sanakht originally from the Wadi Maghareh on the Sinai Peninsula.

== Identity ==
Sanakht&#x27;s identity and position in the Third Dynasty is not entirely clear and remains the subject of debate. While Sanakht&#x27;s existence is attested by seal fragments from mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf and a graffito, his position as the founder of the Third Dynasty, as recorded by Manetho and the Turin Canon, has been seriously undermined by recent archaeological discoveries at Abydos. These discoveries establish that it was likely Djoser who helped bury—and thus succeed—Khasekhemwy, rather than Sanakht. This is determined from seals bearing Djoser&#x27;s name found at the entrance to the latter&#x27;s tomb.

Proponents of the theory that Sanakht was nonetheless the founder of the dynasty object that the presence of Djoser&#x27;s seals in Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb only shows that Djoser conducted cultural rituals in honor of this king, and does not necessarily imply that Djoser was Khasekhemwy&#x27;s immediate successor. Sanakht could then have married Queen Nimaethap, with Nimaethap being the daughter of Khasekhemwy rather than his wife. Together with Sanakht, they could be the parents of Djoser. Alternatively, some have considered Sanakht to be Djoser&#x27;s elder brother.

Presently, the dominant theory is that Sanakht&#x27;s reign dates to the later Third Dynasty, after Djoser. Egyptologists Toby Wilkinson, Stephan Seidlmayer, Kenneth Kitchen and Rainer Stadelmann equate Sanakht with &quot;Nebka&quot;, a name appearing in Ramesside king lists. In support of this theory is a clay seal fragment on which the lower part of a cartouche appears. In this cartouche Wilkinson, Seidlmayer and Stadelmann see traces of a &quot;Ka&quot;-sign, the end of the name &quot;Nebka&quot;. Likewise, Dietrich Wildung favors equating Nebka with Sanakht, although he questions the validity of the seal as evidence given that it is too badly damaged to read the inscription within the cartouche as &quot;Nebka&quot; with any certainty.

John D. Degreef, Nabil Swelim, and Wolfgang Helck are against equating Nebka with Sanakht. They refer to the fact that the name &quot;Nebka&quot; is not attested on any monument nor in any document dating to before Djoser. Instead, Nabil Swelim identifies Nebka with the Horus name Khaba. He further identifies Sanakht with a king &quot;Mesochris&quot; mentioned by Manetho, regarding this as a Hellenized form of the throne name of Sanakht. He dated Sanakht&#x27;s reign to between the seventh and eighth king of the Third Dynasty.

Jürgen von Beckerath, Wolfgang Helck, Dietrich Wildung and Peter Kaplony proposed that Sanakht&#x27;s Horus name is that of the shadowy &quot;Horus Sa&quot;, seeing the name &quot;Sa&quot; as a short form of &quot;Sanakht&quot;. From this, Wolfgang Helck holds that Sanakht&#x27;s Nisut-Biti name was Weneg. King Weneg, however, is widely held to have ruled during the Second Dynasty, and Helck&#x27;s theory has been greeted with skepticism.

Sanakht&#x27;s name was once read &quot;Hen Nekht&quot; by Egyptologists such as Ernest Wallis Budge. Today, this reading is not in use anymore; the up-to-date reading is &quot;Sanakht&quot; or (seldom) &quot;Nakht-Sa&quot;.

== Reign ==

The exact duration of Sanakht&#x27;s time on the throne is unknown. Unlike Djoser, few relics survive from his reign, which casts serious doubts on the traditional figure of 18 years of reign for this king, as given by both Manetho and the Turin Canon. It must be stressed that the Turin Canon and Manetho were more than one and two thousand years removed from the time of Egypt&#x27;s Third Dynasty, and would be expected to contain some inaccurate or unreliable data. The Turin Canon, for instance, was transcribed on papyri that dates to the reign of the New Kingdom king, Ramesses II, who ruled Egypt from 1279 to 1213 BC.

Very little is known of Sanakht&#x27;s activities during his reign. The presence of reliefs depicting him in the Sinai at Wadi Maghareh together with those of Djoser and Sekhemkhet suggest an important Egyptian presence there at the time of the Third Dynasty. Expeditions were launched to that location for the procurement of mineral resources, in particular turquoise.

== Tomb ==

The location of Sanakht&#x27;s tomb is not known with certainty. It was long thought that Sanakht&#x27;s tomb was the large mastaba K2 at Beit Khallaf, as excavations there yielded relief fragments bearing his name. However, some Egyptologists now regard this mastaba as the burial of a high official, prince or queen rather than that of a pharaoh, while others continue to support the first hypothesis.

In the mastaba were found the skeletal remains of a man over tall. According to Charles S. Myers, this stature was considerably taller than the average of prehistoric and later Egyptians. The specimen&#x27;s skull was very large and capacious. Although his cranial index was unusually broad and almost brachycephalic, the proportions of his long bones were tropically adapted like those of most other ancient Egyptians; especially those from the predynastic period. His overall cranial features, however, were closer to those of dynastic period Egyptian skulls.

Consequently, the mastaba has been associated with an anecdote related by Manetho in which he tells of a late Second Dynasty king, called &quot;Sesochris&quot;, whom he describes as being particularly tall. The Egyptologist Wolfgang Helck proposed another hypothesis; namely, that Sanakht&#x27;s tomb is an unfinished structure west of the pyramid of Djoser.

While the case of Sanakht has often appeared in the medical literature as a potential case of pituitary disease, no definitive consensus has existed for many years on whether it was acromegaly or gigantism. In 2017 palaeopathologist Francesco M. Galassi and Egyptologist Michael E. Habicht from Zurich University&#x27;s Institute of Evolutionary Medicine coordinated an international team of researchers to reassess this case. Their conclusion was that the alleged remains of Sanakht are clearly the oldest known case of gigantism in the world.

<text>Milsons Point is a suburb on the lower North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located three kilometres north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of North Sydney.

Milsons Point is also the geographical feature that juts into Sydney Harbour from the northern side, directly opposite Sydney Cove, the spot where the first European settlement was established in 1788. It was named after James Milson, one of the earliest settlers.

==History==
The area was originally known as &quot;Miller&#x27;s Point&quot; or &quot;Kurraba&quot;. It adopted its name &quot;Milson&#x27;s Point&quot; in the 1830s to refer to the area near the northern side of Sydney Harbour.

Milsons Point was named after James Milson, a free settler originally from Lincolnshire. Milson settled in the area near Milsons Point and established a profitable business supplying ships with stone ballast, fresh water, and the produce of his dairy, orchard, and vegetable gardens. In the early 1820s, Milson settled in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street, Kirribilli, on 120 acres of land he leased from Robert Campbell. In 1824 Milson received a 50-acre grant of his own adjoining Campbell&#x27;s land (which is marked on the 1840s map above). In 1826 a bushfire raged through the area destroying Milson&#x27;s home, orchard and dairy and farm which he subsequently rebuilt (refer to 1840s map). In 1831 Campbell was involved with Milson in a court action over Milson&#x27;s non-payment of the lease of the 120 acres. Milson lived in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street until 1831 when he built a new home, &quot;Brisbane House&quot;, on his 50 acres facing Lavender Bay. The next home he built, also on his 50 acres, was called &quot;Grantham&quot;. By the 1840s, Milson was leasing only the portion Campbell&#x27;s 120 acres that contained Milson&#x27;s orchard in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street. In 1872, Milson died at home at &quot;Grantham&quot; in the modern suburb of Milsons Point in what was then called the Municipality of East St Leonards.

The last of the family&#x27;s holdings in the lower North Shore area were resumed in the early 1920s for the construction of the Harbour Bridge and associated roadways.

After World War II, Milsons Point became largely residential, but its location made it a highly desirable area for development. The suburb, in close proximity to the Sydney central business district (CBD), was a prime spot for growth and urbanization. More high-rise buildings began to develop in the 1960s, especially around the main thoroughfares like Alfred Street and the areas near the Harbour Bridge. It fully embraces its status as a major residential and business area, with its proximity to the Harbour Bridge, making it one of the most sought-after locations in Sydney. Today, the area is home to many contemporary apartment buildings and office complexes and remains a popular location for both locals and visitors in closeness to the Sydney Harbour.

SBS operated its headquarters and television station from 1991 until its closure in 2016.

== Heritage listings ==
Milsons Point has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* North Shore railway line: Milsons Point railway station

==Sport and recreation==
Milsons Point has the entertainment centre Luna Park and the North Sydney Olympic Pool.
On 4 October 1935, Luna Park was opened in Milsons Point on the northern edge of Sydney Harbour. The harbour-side amusement park features a collection of preserved fantasy architecture in the style of Art Deco.

==Schools==
Schools in the area include the Catholic schools Loreto Kirribilli for girls and St Aloysius&#x27; College for boys.

A state school, Milsons Point Public School, opened in 1887. It was closed by the state government in 1990, despite earlier promises by Premier Nick Greiner that it would remain open and a legal challenge by the school&#x27;s parents. The former campus was then purchased by St Aloysius&#x27; College in 1991 and converted into the college&#x27;s junior school.

<text>Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900 (1995), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning &quot;affirmative gerrymandering/racial gerrymandering&quot;, where racial minority-majority electoral districts are created during redistricting to increase minority Congressional representation.

==Background==
Only one of Georgia&#x27;s ten congressional districts was primarily African American between 1980 and 1990. According to the 1990 census, Georgia&#x27;s increase in population entitled the state to an eleventh congressional seat. That prompted Georgia&#x27;s General Assembly to re-draw the state&#x27;s congressional districts. After the Justice Department denied several of the Assembly&#x27;s proposed new districts, as the state&#x27;s population was 27% African-American, but formed a majority in only one of the now 11 districts, the Assembly drew the 11th district to create a second majority-black district. However the district lacked any sort of organic structure, and was deemed a &quot;geographic monstrosity&quot; because it extended approximately 260 square miles from Atlanta to the Atlantic Ocean. The case was brought to court by white voters in the Eleventh Congressional District of the state of Georgia.

==Question before the Supreme Court==
Is racial gerrymandering of the congressional redistricting process a violation of the Equal Protection Clause?

==Decision of the Court==
Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the Court. Ruling against the district, the Court declared the district unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to the interpretation in &quot;Shaw v. Reno&quot; (1993). The court noted that in some instances, &quot;a reapportionment plan may be so highly irregular and bizarre in shape that it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to segregate voters based on race.&quot; Citing &quot;Shaw v. Reno,&quot; the majority concluded that strict scrutiny is required whenever race is the &quot;overriding, predominant force&quot; in the redistricting process. Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor wrote a concurrence, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissent joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Stephen G. Breyer, and David H. Souter. Stevens wrote an additional, separate dissent joined by no other justice.

<text>Sir Francis Joseph Kitts (1 May 1912 – 16 March 1979) was a New Zealand politician. Originally from the South Island, he served in the military and later was a civil servant before entering politics with the Labour Party. He was the Member of Parliament for between and 1960. He was also the longest-serving Mayor of Wellington, holding the post from 1956 to 1974. He was also a member at various times of several other local bodies and was still an elected official at his death.

==Early life==
Kitts was born in Waimate, the son of an Australian quarryman, and attended Marist Brothers primary school alongside his half-brother John before completing his education at Timaru Boys&#x27; High School. He was an active athlete and was a talented swimmer also having an interest in both boxing and rugby. He was a firm believer in physical fitness and had a lifelong twice-a-day exercise regimen. Whilst still at high school he joined the branch of the Labour Party at 16, with his father&#x27;s encouragement, and was branch president from 1936 to 1938. In 1938 Kitts stood unsuccessfully for the Timaru Borough Council as a Labour candidate. Kitts enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in July 1940 during World War II and served for five years with the home forces as a staff sergeant. Whilst posted in Otaki he met Iris Woodcock at the local racecourse and the two married in 1949. The couple had no children.

Following the war he moved to Wellington, and worked as a civil servant in a clerical role for the Government Stores Board. He became the vice-president of the branch of the Labour Party in 1947. He was a competent debater and was a team leader for the Wellington Metropolitan Debating Club. He held Saturday morning talks along a walking route down Bowen Street Lambton Quay and Willis Street with residents from all around Wellington, which earned him a public reputation in the city. Kitts walked the route nearly every day for the next 25 years.

Newspaper reports after his death say he was a &quot;man of mystery&quot; as little is known about his early life, and his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in New Zealand&quot; entries in 1971 and 1978 both start with his election to Wellington local bodies in 1950. His brother, Father John Kitts, who was chaplain at the Villa Maria Convent in Brisbane, stated that Kitts seldom spoke of his private life and his wife Iris was the only person who truly knew him.

==Political career==
===National politics===


Kitts stood unsuccessfully for Labour in two elections, in for , and in for . He was also speculated as a potential successor to Peter Fraser in the 1951 Brooklyn by-election but declined to stand. He was finally elected as the Member of Parliament for from to replace the retiring Charles Chapman. Given his mayoral experience the press speculated he was a likely candidate for the role of either Speaker of the House of Representatives or Chairman of Committees after the formation of the Second Labour Government. He was appointed to neither and remained a backbencher. During the government&#x27;s term, Kitts was one of a group of three Labour MPs (the others being Mick Moohan and Bill Fox) who were deeply critical of the decisions made in the &quot;Black Budget&quot;. Kitts supported the 1959 National Roads Amendment Bill, which allowed the construction of free-flowing state highways into urban centres by the government funded by petrol taxes. He also supported the controversial plan by the Ministry of Works to build the Wellington Urban Motorway through the historic Bolton Street Cemetery, arguing it was necessary for commuters to get to and from work.

He was to hold the seat to 1960, when he was unexpectedly defeated by the National candidate Dan Riddiford. He later failed to win back the electorate in 1963. Years later, ahead of the , he put himself forward for the Labour nomination to stand in the newly created electorate, but lost out to Gerry Wall. Kitts&#x27; brother said that not remaining in Parliament longer had been his biggest regret.

===Local-body politics===
At the 1950 local-body elections the Labour Party had no obvious mayoral candidate, and Labour activist Gerald O&#x27;Brien suggested to Kitts should stand. Kitts was reluctant but was persuaded to do so. He likewise stood for the Wellington City Council, Wellington Harbour Board and Wellington Hospital Board. He polled far better than expected for the mayoralty, but was defeated by Robert Macalister of the Citizens&#x27; Association. He was however elected to the City Council, Harbour Board and Hospital Board. In 1953 he stood again for all four offices but was again defeated by Macalister for the mayoralty. His popularity had grown significantly and was not only re-elected to the three local bodies, but topped the poll for all three, gaining more votes than any other candidate, the first time this had been achieved in Wellington history. He served on the Wellington Fire Board from 1954, the Hospital Board from 1950 to 1956 and the Harbour Board from 1950 until his death in 1979. He was also the chairman of the Wellington City and Suburban Water Supply Board, director of the New Zealand Municipalities Co-operative Insurance Company and patron of the City of Wellington Highland Pipe Band.

In 1956 Kitts was elected mayor on his third attempt, exploiting a split vote on the centre-right with Macalister running as an independent after losing the Citizens&#x27; Association nomination to Ernest Toop. He became Wellington&#x27;s first Labour mayor in 46 years. He would remain Wellington&#x27;s mayor for the next 18 years. During his entire mayoralty Labour never had a council majority and Kitts led Citizens&#x27; dominated councils. Accordingly, Kitts adopted a leadership style that encouraged impartial chairmanship of council committees. He was re-elected over Toop (this time his sole opponent) in 1959 despite Labour&#x27;s council ticket faring much worse with its representation being halved from six seats to three. The overall anti-Labour vote (which was consistent nationwide) was attributed to the unpopularity of the then Labour government. In increasing his majority over twelve percent against the national trend newspapers lauded Kitts&#x27; win as a &#x27;personal triumph&#x27;.

In 1962 he recorded the highest ever number of votes in a mayoral election in Wellington. He was a &quot;full-time mayor&quot; devoting as full working day to the role and made a point of attending to the ceremonial and social aspects of the mayoralty. He would attend thousands of meetings and functions in the city every year. This was a departure from the traditional concept of the mayoral office as a part-time role for a businessman-politician, which was used unsuccessfully by the Citizens&#x27; mayoral candidates in 1959 and 1962 as the basis for their campaigns against Kitts. This backfired on the Citizens&#x27; as many groups and businesses in the city appreciated the advent of an &quot;open door policy&quot; for them with the mayoral office. Kitts&#x27; had a legendary reputation for food consumption at such functions. He was said to swallow sausage rolls &quot;like he was posting a letter&quot; and famously devoured two cooked chickens in a single sitting.

The city continued to modernise under Kitts, one particular landmark of this was in May 1964 when the council replaced its system of trams for public transport with trolley buses. This was after a long public campaign to retain the trams led by Saul Goldsmith. Kitts himself confessed he had a secret desire to keep the trams, but as the council had a Citizen&#x27;s majority he could not stop the process, describing the decision to replace them as a &quot;retrograde step.&quot; During his mayoralty the council began its foray into public housing. In August 1965 the Hanson Court flats, with 30 low-rental units, were opened in Newtown. This opened a new a civic endeavour that was to produce multiple affordable high-density homes. This was followed by the Te Ara Hou flats, Arlington Flats and the Central Park flats among others, ultimately resulting 2,300 units making Wellington City Council one of the country&#x27;s largest residential landlords. This was part of a larger urban renewal agenda promoted by Citizens&#x27; councillor George Porter, who Kitts thought of as a &#x27;secret socialist&#x27; and was happy to support him.

In 1969 he surpassed Thomas Hislop to become Wellington&#x27;s longest serving mayor. That year, Cuba Street was pedestrianised by his council to create what is now known as Cuba Mall. As mayor Kitts travelled overseas as an ambassador for the city and made a point of visiting every city named Wellington in the world. In 1971 he visited Antarctica. Like Norman Kirk, also from Waimate, he was &quot;a big man, using his imposing six foot two inch, 17 stone frame to overshadow his opponents.&quot;

He was unexpectedly defeated by a narrow margin in 1974 by Michael Fowler. The result was so close that several re-counts were required before the final result was known, ending Kitts&#x27; record tenure as mayor, though he was still re-elected as a member of the Harbour Board.

===Post mayoralty===
To the surprise of most, the Third Labour Government did not appoint him to any higher office. Labour city councillor Joe Aspell said &quot;Thousands expected Frank Kitts to be given something to make use of his considerable ability&quot;. He did become President of the Sporting Clubs Association of New Zealand. There was also speculation that he would stand for Parliament once again at the for the Wellington seat of , however he did not put himself forward for the Labour nomination.

In a surprise move, Kitts attempted a political comeback in 1977. He was again defeated by Fowler with his vote share falling further, though contrarily his vote increased for the Harbour Board, to which he was again elected. A &quot;Dominion&quot; editorial said of Kitts&#x27; candidature &quot;No one knew what Frank Kitts did during his three years in the political wilderness and no one knew why he wanted to come back&quot;.

==Death==
Kitts died suddenly on 16 March 1979, aged 67, collapsing at his home after completing a morning shopping trip with his wife. His funeral was held in St Mary of the Angels and attracted over 400 mourners. Tributes were given by Kitts&#x27; successor as mayor Michael Fowler and former prime minister Bill Rowling among others. Following the service his body was taken in a civic cortège along his famous walking route along Willis Street, Lambton Quay and Bowen Street to Karori Cemetery where he was buried.

He was still a member of the Harbour Board at his death. A by-election was avoided when Terry Brandon, the highest polling unsuccessful candidate from the 1977 election, was appointed to fill Kitts&#x27; vacant seat.

==Frank Kitts Park==
Frank Kitts Park on Wellington&#x27;s waterfront is named after him. The park, on the site formerly used for a row of wharf sheds, was opened in 1976 and after redevelopment reopened in 1990. There is a children&#x27;s playground, the orange foremast recovered from , and a water sculpture &quot;The Albatross&quot; by Tanya Ashken.

==Honours==
Kitts was known for his tireless public service, which continued after his retirement, including helping Wellington&#x27;s immigrant community. In the 1966 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services as mayor of Wellington. In the 1975 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Kitts&#x27; wife, Iris, Lady Kitts, was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community as mayoress of Wellington between 1956 and 1974. Iris was well-liked as Mayoress, but attracted sympathy due to unsubstantiated innuendos about her husband being a philanderer.

The Kitts Trophy for Impromptu Speaking is awarded by the Wellington Speaking Union every year. The trophy is named after Kitts, who donated it in 1967 to encourage excellence in impromptu speaking.

<text>The Fender Jaguar is an electric guitar by Fender Musical Instruments characterized by an offset-waist body, a relatively unusual switching system with two separate circuits for lead and rhythm, and a short-scale 24&quot; neck. Owing some roots to the Jazzmaster, it was introduced in 1962 as Fender&#x27;s feature-laden top-of-the-line model, designed to lure players from Gibson. During its initial 13-year production run, the Jaguar did not sell as well as the less expensive Stratocaster and Telecaster, and achieved its most noticeable popularity in the surf music scene. After the Jaguar was taken out of production in 1975, vintage Jaguars became popular first with American punk rock players, and then more so during the alternative rock, shoegazing and indie rock movements of the 1980s and 1990s. Fender began making a version in Japan in the mid-1980s, and then introduced a USA-made reissue in 1999. Since then, Fender has made a variety of Jaguars in America, Mexico, Indonesia and China under both the Fender and Squier labels. Original vintage Jaguars sell for many times their original price.

==History==

===Initial production, 1962–75===
Both the Fender company and vintage guitar authorities date the introduction of the Jaguar to 1962. One writer states that the model was introduced in December 1960, but a 1962 ad featuring a Jaguar automobile in the background referred to the &quot;new&quot; Fender Jaguar.

1960s advertising for the Jaguar often had beach themes, underscoring the guitar&#x27;s appeal to surf musicians. Photographs for the campaign, done by Bob Perine, included photographs of bikini-clad girls on sandy beaches holding Jaguars—many of these featured Perine&#x27;s daughter and her friends. The guitar was not, however, heavily publicized by surf players themselves, although The Beach Boys&#x27; Carl Wilson is featured in one early publicity photo.

The Jaguar never enjoyed the popularity of its Stratocaster and Telecaster siblings. After several upgrades—which included custom finishes, a bound neck, pearloid block inlays, maple fingerboard with black binding, and block inlays—the Jaguar was discontinued in December 1975 after a thirteen-year production run.

===Resurgence===
Punk and early new wave guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of the band Television (who can be seen playing a Jaguar on a 2003 album cover) adopted the Jaguar for both contrarian and economic reasons; its lack of mainstream use made it both a style statement and less expensive than guitars of comparable quality. In the 1990s the popularity of the Jaguar and Jazzmaster exploded after they were used by guitarists such as Scott Hill, John Squire,
Kurt Cobain (for whom a signature model was introduced),
Kevin Shields, Black Francis, J Mascis, Brian Molko, Rowland S. Howard,
Thurston Moore, John Frusciante, Will Sergeant
and Johnny Marr (who has a signature model).
Despite this, Jaguars still fetch considerably less than Telecasters and Stratocasters of similar vintage.

One of the reasons why the Jaguar was used by indie rock artists is the sonic possibilities offered by the bridge construction. The bridge and vibrato unit of the Jaguar and the Jazzmaster help produce sympathetic resonance since there is a considerable length of string between the bridge and the tailpiece. Additionally, by strumming the strings behind the bridge, a characteristic chiming sound can be created, an effect which has been exploited by artists like Sonic Youth.

Given the relative rarity of Jaguar players, perhaps the only example of a band that used two guitarists on Jaguars simultaneously in performance on certain of their numbers was the 2003-2004 and post-2012 lineups of The Mavericks, featuring Raul Malo and Eddie Perez.

===Reissue===
Fender reissued the 1962 version of the Jaguar in 1999 as part of its American Vintage Reissue (AVRI) Series (lower cost Japanese-made versions were available between 1984 and 2015, originally made of basswood and then alder like their American counterparts). Several other variations have been released within the last decade, including several humbucker versions and a Jaguar bass guitar in 2006. Fender Japan produced Jaguars for its own domestic market with numerous special editions including an accurate version of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s modified model until Fender chose to end the licensing agreement in place since the early 1980s in favor of taking over Japanese production themselves in 2015. There are notable differences between the typical Japanese models and their American counterparts. One of the more notable examples would be the electronics: Japanese production models typically used cheaper wiring, miniature pots throughout the guitar (as opposed to only in the rhythm circuit as would be found on original and AVRI examples), lower-quality pickups, and shielding paint as opposed to brass shielding plates installed in the cavities (Japanese guitars made before 96/97 also have brass shielding) seen on typical American Jaguars. Original and AVRI variants have nitrocellulose lacquer finishes, while Japanese versions would typically be finished in polyester, though there are rare Japanese examples with nitrocellulose finishes as well. US-produced AVRI Jaguars often did not sport matching headstocks, unlike their vintage counterparts, however, many Japanese models do, and also offer some custom colors not found as easily on American models.

In the late 2000s, Fender began to offer limited editions of the AVRI models from a few of their more-popular retailers, with these specific variants being referred to as the Thin Skin series. A collaboration between several notable American guitar retailers (Such as Dave&#x27;s Guitar Shop in Wisconsin and Wildwood Guitars in Colorado) culminated in the release of otherwise typical AVRI Jaguars as well as Jazzmasters, Telecasters, and Stratocasters, but in more sought-after Classic finishes that Fender otherwise had little interest in releasing themselves. These were almost identical to the production AVRI models, with the exception of their finish options and the inclusion of matching headstocks, a 9.5&quot; fretboard radius instead of the vintage-accurate 7.25&quot;, and jumbo fretwire. The Thin Skin models used 100% nitrocellulose finishes, a departure from the production models, which used polyurethane undercoats/sealers. These Thin Skin models also featured thinner color and clear coats. These models were available in a number of Custom Colors, and, unlike the standard production &#x27;62 Jaguars, these did feature matching headstocks.

In 2012, Fender replaced the entire AVRI line with the American Vintage (AV) Series. The AV Series included more vintage-accurate appointments, such as more accurate decals, thinner cases (as would be found with original 1950s/60s models), a new &#x27;flash&#x27; finishing process, updated neck profiles, pickups, tuners, and vintage-reproduction paperwork and manuals. The replacement for the 1962 Jaguar was the 1965 Jaguar. The 1965 Jaguar features a bound rosewood fingerboard with larger pearloid dot inlays, a slightly larger C profile, new, more vintage-accurate pickups, a thinner finish, no amber tint in the clear coat on the neck, and ships with a black tolex case with a red plush interior. Originally offered in Candy Apple Red and Three-Color Sunburst, the Candy Apple Red has since been discontinued. As with the AVRI model, the headstock on the AV &#x27;65 in Candy Apple Red did not feature a matching headstock. Fender did offer a limited production run of the &#x27;65 Jaguar in Ice Blue Metallic, which did feature a matching headstock.

Fender&#x27;s Custom Shop also produces various Jaguar models, many of which are reissues/relics. Some of the Custom Shop offerings feature modern appointments (such as radius, pickups, hardware, and finishes).

Although Fender has many signature Stratocasters and Telecasters designed in conjunction with famous players and the first signature Jazzmasters were introduced in 2007, Kurt Cobain&#x27;s signature Jaguar was introduced in 2011 (20th anniversary of the release of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; album). In the past, a Kurt Cobain replica Jaguar was made for the Japanese domestic market. The Fender Jag-Stang, a Mustang/Jaguar hybrid, was built for Kurt Cobain based on his design.

In May 2008 Fender introduced the Classic Player Series Jaguar and Jaguar HH with dual humbuckers, which are made in Mexico and sold for under $1000. Fender have made numerous changes to the classic design, however, replacing the bridge with a Tune-o-matic type, giving it a 9.5&quot; fretboard radius, moving the vibrato unit plate closer to the bridge and installing high output pickups. This Classic Player guitar is also available as a &quot;1966&quot; limited-edition version with a bound neck featuring rectangular block inlays and CBS-style decals as of 2009.

In September 2010 the Black Top Jaguar HH was introduced as part of the Mexico-made Black Top series. Features include a solid alder body with gloss polyester finish, chrome hardware, dual Hot Vintage AlNiCo humbucking pickups with chrome metal covers and black skirted amp knobs. Other refinements include a maple neck with a 9.5&quot;-radius rosewood fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, 24&quot;-scale length, a stop tailpiece and a three-way toggle switch.

==Features==
The Jaguar was built from ideas first incorporated in the Jazzmaster, with a similar &quot;offset waist&quot; body and vibrato unit. Unlike the Jazzmaster, the Jaguar was fitted with a shorter 24-inch scale, 22-fret neck and featured smaller single-coil pickups with notched side plates that improved RF shielding, making the Jaguar less prone to interference than the more popular Stratocaster and Telecaster.

The Jaguar and the Jazzmaster also shared a dual-circuit setup, one circuit for lead and another for rhythm, each with separate controls, allowing for two preset tone and volume settings between which the guitarist could rapidly switch. The Jaguar, however, had a more complex lead circuit consisting of three switches and two dials on the lower bout: the first two switches were on/off switches for the neck and bridge pickups, respectively, while the third switch engaged a capacitor that served as a high-pass filter (sometimes referred to as a &quot;strangle&quot; switch). The rhythm circuit, set into operation when the upper bout switch is flicked upwards, had individual volume and tone rollers but no option to choose between pickups. This rhythm circuit has a bassier, neck-pickup only range.

Another new feature was a spring-loaded rubber string mute, which was flipped upwards from under the strings by a lever. The mute was designed for guitarists who had to palm mute for extended periods, which was difficult or impossible on the Jaguar&#x27;s floating bridge without knocking the bridge out of position. This feature proved unpopular and became known as a &quot;tone killer&quot;; the cover and its foam were usually quickly removed.

The bridge on many versions of the Jaguar has become known for several design shortcomings and consequent problems. The &quot;threaded&quot; bridge saddles allow the strings to slip out of alignment if they are plucked or strummed hard, motivating some players to fit replacement saddles that have deeper slots or grooves to hold the strings, or to replace the bridge completely. The Fender Mustang style bridge is a popular choice of replacement. Another issue sometimes encountered is a tendency for the bridge&#x27;s support posts to slip down into the holes that house them. Some people have use strategies inconsistent with the original intended physics to stop the bridge from rocking as it was designed to do, including wrapping tape around the bridge posts.

Like the Jazzmaster and Bass VI, the Jaguar has an unusual floating vibrato mechanism that was a complete departure from the &quot;synchronized vibrato&quot; system found on the Stratocaster. Leo Fender believed that this new design was superior to previous designs since the bridge actually moved backwards and forwards along with the strings during vibrato use, thereby maintaining proper intonation even under duress, and preventing strings from binding. This floating bridge concept was also later used on the Fender Mustang. The floating vibrato mechanism also features a built-in lock, which helped the player preserve the guitar&#x27;s tuning in the event of a string breakage and easing removal of the vibrato arm.

==Variations==

;Fender 50th Anniversary Jaguar
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jaguar in 2012, Fender released a USA-made model that featured a C-shaped maple neck with lacquer finish and vintage-style truss rod, bound 9.5&quot;-radius rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets and pearloid block inlays, a modified one-degree neck-angle-pocket cut to improve pitch, a re-positioned tremolo plate to increase bridge break angle to prevent string slippage and increased sustain, a custom neckplate and specially designed hotter wound single-coil neck and bridge pickups for fatter tone and more output. The 50th Anniversary Jaguar was available in three Custom Colors: Burgundy Mist Metallic, Candy Apple Red, and Lake Placid Blue. The first 100 of each color were hand-numbered.

<text>Alun Morgun Richards (27 October 1929 – 2 June 2004) was a Welsh novelist, best known for his novel &quot;Ennal&#x27;s Point&quot;, about the work of a lifeboat crew in South Wales.

Richards was born in King Edward Avenue, Caerphilly. He was educated at Pontypridd Grammar School and the University College of Wales. After training to be a teacher Richards joined the Royal Navy which sparked a fascination with the sea that inspired much of his writing.

In 1955, he returned to Wales from London but became ill with tuberculosis and was admitted to the sanatorium at Talgarth. After two years he was released and married Helen Howden, a probation officer, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.

He taught English for 10 years and settled in Mumbles, Swansea, which provided the backdrop for much of his writing.

As well as novels and short stories, he wrote extensively for theatre and television, including at least one episode of &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;.

A connoisseur of rugby union, Richards published &quot;A Touch of Glory&quot; to mark the centenary of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1980 and a memoir of Carwyn James in 1984.

In 1985, Richard was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the University College of Swansea.

He died in Singleton Hospital, Swansea, on 2 June 2004, aged 74, after a heart attack.

<doc id="1098368" wikidata="Q1473265" url="?curid=1098368" title="Information technology management">
<text>Information technology management (IT management) is the discipline whereby all of the information technology resources of a firm are managed in accordance with its needs and priorities. Managing the responsibility within a company entails many of the basic management functions, like budgeting, staffing, change management, and organizing and controlling, along with other aspects that are unique to technology, like software design, network planning, tech support etc.

==Purpose==
The central aim of IT management is to generate value through the use of technology. To achieve this, business strategies and technology must be aligned.

IT Management is different from management information systems. The latter refers to management methods tied to the automation or support of human decision making. IT Management refers to IT related management activities in organizations. MIS is focused mainly on the business aspect, with a strong input into the technology phase of the business/organization.

A primary focus of IT management is the value creation made possible by technology. This requires the alignment of technology and business strategies. While the value creation for an organization involves a network of relationships between internal and external environments, technology plays an important role in improving the overall value chain of an organization. However, this increase requires business and technology management to work as a creative, synergistic, and collaborative team instead of a purely mechanistic span of control.

Historically, one set of resources was dedicated to one particular computing technology, business application or line of business, and managed in a silo-like fashion. These resources supported a single set of requirements and processes, and couldn&#x27;t easily be optimized or reconfigured to support actual demand. This led technology providers to build out and complement their product-centric infrastructure and management offerings with Converged Infrastructure environments that converge servers, storage, networking, security, management and facilities. The efficiencies of having this type of integrated and automated management environment allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with simpler manageability and maintenance, and enables IT to adjust IT resources (such as servers, storage and networking) quicker to meet unpredictable business demand.

==IT management disciplines==
The below concepts are commonly listed or investigated under the broad term IT Management:


* Business/IT alignment
* IT governance
* IT financial management
* IT service management
*Information Systems
*Information security
* Sourcing
* IT configuration management
* IT infrastructure

==IT managers==
IT managers have a lot in common with project managers but their main difference is one of focus: an IT manager is responsible and accountable for an ongoing program of IT services while the project manager&#x27;s responsibility and accountability are both limited to a project with a clear start and end date.

Most IT management programs are designed to educate and develop managers who can effectively manage the planning, design, selection, implementation, use, and administration of emerging and converging information and communications technologies. The program curriculum provides students with the technical knowledge and management knowledge and skills needed to effectively integrate people, information and communication technologies, and business processes in support of organizational strategic goals.

IT Managers need to know predominantly Technical and Managerial skills such as analyst of computer systems, information security analyst, compute, planning, communication technologies, and business processes.

Graduates should be able:

#to explain the important terminology, facts, concepts, principles, analytic techniques, and theories used in IT management.
#to apply important terminology, facts, concepts, principles, analytic techniques, and theories in IT management when analyzing complex factual situations.
#to integrate (or synthesize) important facts, concepts, principles, and theories in IT management when developing solutions to IT management multifaceted problems in complex situations.

==Consequences of IT management deficiencies==

In 2013, hackers managed to install malware with the intent of stealing Target&#x27;s customers&#x27; information. The malware targeted “40 million credit card numbers—and 70 million addresses, phone numbers, and other pieces of personal information”. About six months before this happened, Target invested 1.6 million dollars to install the malware detection tool made by FireEye, whose security product is also used by the CIA. The software spotted the malware, and alert was sent out as intended. However, nothing was done beyond that point. The hackers successfully got away with one third of US Consumers’ confidential information. Target&#x27;s security system’s unresponsiveness led to 90 lawsuits being filed against Target, which went on top of another approximate $61 million USD spent just responding to the breach,

<doc id="1098399" wikidata="Q2468823" url="?curid=1098399" title="Twenty-one Conditions">
<text>The Twenty-one Conditions, officially the Conditions of Admission to the Communist International, are the conditions, most of which were suggested by Vladimir Lenin, to the adhesion of the socialist parties to the Third International (Comintern) created in 1919. The conditions were formally adopted by the Second Congress of the Comintern in 1920.

== Content ==
The conditions were:

==SFIO congress==
During the December 1920 Tours Congress of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), the 21 conditions were rejected although the majority, led by Fernand Loriot, Boris Souvarine, Marcel Cachin, and Ludovic Frossard, adhered to the Third International, creating the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC), which would later take the name of the French Communist Party (PCF).

==PSOE congress==
At the July 1920 PSOE congress Fernando de los Ríos proposed that the PSOE should join the Communist International only if defined conditions were met. He and Daniel Anguiano were appointed to visit Soviet Russia to discuss membership of the PSOE in the Communist International. Their trip lasted from 17 October to 13 December 1920. While in Moscow de los Ríos met Lenin, who answered a question by de los Ríos about the compatibility between personal freedom and the length of the dictatorship of the proletariat with the often-quoted answer, „Freedom, what for?“. De los Rios, who believed in a Fabian-humanist form of socialism, told his hosts in Russia that the PSOE should have the right to pick and choose from the Twenty-one Conditions, and should be completely independent of Moscow. This was completely unacceptable to the Bolsheviks.

At the PSOE Extraordinary Congress in April 1921 Anguiano gave a positive report on the Moscow visit and de los Ríos gave a negative report. The congress voted to reject the Twenty-one Conditions demanded by Moscow. Supporters of the Third International left the PSOE and formed the Spanish Communist Workers Party, which combined with the Spanish Communist Party to form the Communist Party of Spain.

<text>Rush Valley is a long north-trending valley in the southeast of Tooele County, Utah. It lies adjacent to and attached to the south of Tooele Valley; the separation point is the low point of the valley at Rush Lake, and lies at the southeast of the small mountain massif causing the separation, South Mountain at . The region of Rush Lake is a marsh region, fed by various streams from the mountain regions east and west.

A southern section of the Tooele Army Depot lies in the valley&#x27;s center-northeast, at the southwest foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains.

==Valley description==
Rush Valley narrows to about wide in the north, between the Stansbury Mountains west, and the Oquirrh Mountains east. The valley widens in the south, making two sections, a due-south section, and a region to the southeast. The southern section contains the communities of Vernon and Faust, with Faust north, closer to the valley&#x27;s center-south. Vernon is in flatlands fed by the Sheeprock Mountains or foothills, southwest, south, and southeast.

The southeast valley section is long from the Rush Valley center and lies at the northwest of the East Tintic Mountains. A ridge north separates Rush Valley from Cedar Valley to the east. Lofgreen is in mountain foothills southwest, and Pehrson with Topliff are in lower elevation regions.

The two southern sections cover a width of about , south of the valley center. The Rush Valley Centerpoint is north of Faust, and the small James Walter Fitzgerald Wildlife Management Area.

==Access==
Utah State Route 36 (SR-36) transects the center of the valley, starting from a section at the northeast, from Tooele and Stockton. It turns and leaves the valley&#x27;s southeast to meet the region of Eureka and Silver City in the East Tintic Mountains.

Utah State Route 73 (SR-73) joins SR-36 at the valley&#x27;s center after traversing the south of the Oquirrh Mountains in the valley&#x27;s southeast (the north perimeter of the southeast section).

From the West, Utah State Route 199 (SR-199) enters the valley center from Dugway, and its canyon route through the western mountains is the dividing line between the Stansbury Mountains north, and the Onaqui Mountains south.
