<text>Claude Closky (born 22 May 1963) is a French artist who lives and works in Paris.

== Reception ==
Closky won the &quot;Grand prix des Arts plastiques&quot; (1999) and the Marcel Duchamp Prize (2005) awarded by the ADIAF.

Dike Blair wrote in &quot;Artforum&quot; Magazine that &quot;The lightness of Closky&#x27;s art belies the depth of its absurdist heredity. Working in a post-modernist mode, Closky&#x27;s art works combine aspects of the Situationists, Fluxus, Beckett, Daniel Buren, and Andy Warhol.&quot;

== Life and career ==
Claude Closky has no formal training as a visual artist. He entered the ENSAD (Ecole National Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs) in 1982, but quit at the end of the first year to co-found &quot;The Ripoulin Brothers&quot;, a street artist collective, with Bla+Bla+Bla, Nina Childress, Jean Faucheur, Pierre Huyghe, Manhu, Ox, Trois carrés. In 1988, he left the group to develop his independent work, using voluntarily poor means such as drawing and printed matter.

He has participated in the Biennials of Lyon (1995), Sydney (1996), Taipei (2000), València (2001), Sharjah (2005), Venice (2017), Mardin (2024). In 2000, the Mudam (Luxembourg Art Museum) commissioned him to conceive and manage its website, for which he made a magazine and a gallery dedicated to the internet. The site was launched at the Luxembourg Pavilion in the 2001, Venice Biennale. It presented specific works by Heath Bunting, François Curlet, Pierre Leguillon, Aleksandra Mir, Peter Kogler, David Shrigley, among others. Since 2005, he has taught at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 2012, he curated &quot;This &amp; There&quot;, an exhibition to celebrate the tenth year of the &quot;Pavilion, Palais de Tokyo Laboratory for Creation&quot; (Paris) which presented the work of 74 artists in 74 different spaces. He has curated in 2020 &quot;X&quot; at the Frac Pays de la Loire and in 2023 &quot;Offset&quot; at the Centre des livres d&#x27;artistes.

== Work ==
The work of Claude Closky is mainly immaterial. Language is his model to articulate images, text, numbers, and sounds collected in our environment, or made in his studio. Although Closky is reluctant to produce objects and spectacular effects, his work still addresses issues about visibility and space appropriation.

Claude Closky&#x27;s projects always find alternative ways to emancipate themselves from the formats imposed by the sites where they are exhibited. He seeks to point out the contradictions of our contemporary society and its representations, but also to question the role of art as producer of a cultural consensus and set of values. His works confront and question our environment, the conditions and benefits of artistic production, its relation to an audience.

<text>Hong Kong (1800s–1930s) oversaw the founding of the new crown colony of Hong Kong under the British Empire. After the First Opium War, the territory was ceded by the Qing Empire to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland through Treaty of Nanjing (1842) and Convention of Peking (1860) &quot;in perpetuity&quot;. Together with additional land that was leased to the British under the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory (1898), Hong Kong became one of the first parts of East Asia to undergo industrialisation.

==Territorial establishment==
===Beginning of trade===


China was the main supplier of its native tea to the British, whose annual domestic consumption reached in 1830, an average of per head of population.

From the British economic standpoint, Chinese tea was a crucial item since it provided massive wealth for the taipansforeign (especially British) businessmen in Chinawhile the duty on tea accounted for 10% of the government&#x27;s income. Some of the earliest items sold to China in exchange for tea were British clocks, watches and musical boxes known as &quot;sing-songs&quot;. However, these were not enough to compensate for the trade imbalance and the insistence by the Chinese that they be paid in silver. Opium exports from India after 1830 provided the silver needed to balance the trade. Lin Zexu, a special Chinese commissioner appointed by the Qing Daoguang Emperor, wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839 taking a stance against the acceptance of opium in trade. He confiscated more than 20,000 chests of opium already in Hong Kong, which had already been used years earlier as a transhipment point, and supervised their destruction.

===Confrontation===

London saw the destruction of British products as an insult and sent the first expeditionary force to the region. The First Opium War (1839–1842) began at the hands of Captain Charles Elliot of the Royal Navy and Captain Anthony Blaxland Stransham of the Royal Marines. After a series of Chinese defeats, Hong Kong Island was occupied by the British on 20 January 1841. Commander (later Admiral) Edward Belcher, aboard HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot;, landed in Hong Kong on 25 January 1841. Possession Street still exists to mark the event, with Belcher&#x27;s Bay named after Belcher. Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer raised the Union Jack and claimed Hong Kong as a colony on 26 January 1841. He erected naval store sheds there in April 1841.

The island was first used by the British as a staging post during the war, and while the East India Company intended to establish a permanent base on the island of Zhoushan, Elliot took it upon himself to claim the island on a permanent basis. The ostensible authority for the occupation was negotiated between Captain Eliot and the Viceroy of Liangguang, the Manchu official Qishan. The Convention of Chuenpi was concluded but had not been recognised by the Qing Dynasty court at Beijing. Subsequently, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking, when the territory became a Crown colony.

The Opium War was ostensibly fought to liberalise trade with China. With a base in Hong Kong, British traders, opium dealers, and merchants including Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Dent &amp; Co. launched the city which would become the &#x27;free trade&#x27; nexus of the East. American opium traders and merchant bankers such as the Russell, Perkins and Forbes families would soon join the trade. 

On signature of the 1860 Convention of Peking, which marked the end of formal ended hostilities in the Second Opium War (1856–1858), Britain acquired the area south of Boundary Street on the Kowloon Peninsula rent-free under a perpetual lease. Later, in 1898, the Qing government reluctantly agreed to the Convention between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory (also known as the Second Convention of Peking) that compelled China to cede a further area north of Boundary Street to the Sham Chun River along with more than two hundred nearby islands. Seen by the British government as vital to safeguard the defensive capabilities of Hong Kong, these areas became collectively known as the New Territories. The 99-year lease would expire at midnight on 30June, 1997.

==Demographics==

===Population===

When the union flag was raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841, the population of Hong Kong island was about 6,000, mostly Tanka fishermen and Hakka charcoal burners living in a number of coastal villages. In the 1850s large numbers of Chinese would emigrate from China to Hong Kong due to the Taiping Rebellion. Other events such as floods, typhoons and famine in mainland China would also play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place to escape the mayhem. According to the census of 1865, Hong Kong had a population of 125,504, of which some 2,000 were Americans and Europeans. In 1914 despite an exodus of 60,000 Chinese fearing an attack on the colony during World War I, Hong Kong&#x27;s population continued to increase from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and 1.6 million by 1941.

===Segregation===

The establishment of the free port made Hong Kong a major entrepôt from the start, attracting people from China and Europe alike. The society remained racially segregated and polarised due to British colonial policies and attitudes. Despite the rise of a British-educated Chinese upper class by the late 19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented Chinese from living in elite areas like Victoria Peak. Politically, the majority Chinese population also had little to no official governmental influence throughout much of the early years. There were, however, a small number of Chinese elites that the British governors relied on, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung. They accepted their place in the Hong Kong hierarchy, and served as main communicators and mediators between the government and the Chinese population. Sir Kai Ho was an unofficial member of the Legislative Council. Robert Hotung wanted Chinese citizens to recognise Hong Kong as the new home after the fall of China&#x27;s last dynasty in 1911. As a millionaire with financial influence, he emphasised that no part of the demographics was purely indigenous.

==Culture==
===Lifestyle===
The east portion of Colonial Hong Kong was mostly dedicated to the British; filled with race courses, parade grounds, barracks, cricket and polo fields. The west portion was filled with Chinese shops, crowded markets and tea houses. The Hong Kong tea culture began in this period and evolved into yum cha. One of the most common breakfasts was congee with fish and barley.
In the mid-19th century many of the merchants would sell silk, jade and consult feng shui to open shops that favoured better spiritual arrangements. Other lower ranked groups like coolies arrived with the notion that hard work would better position them for the future. Due to the commercial success of merchants, boatmen, carters and fishermen there, Hong Kong overtook China&#x27;s most populous port in Canton. By 1880 Hong Kong&#x27;s port would handle 27% of the mainland&#x27;s export and 37% of imports.
A British traveller, Isabella Bird, described Hong Kong in the 1870s as a colony filled with comforts and entertainment only a Victorian society would be able to enjoy. Other descriptions mentioned courts, hotels, post offices, shops, city hall complexes, museums, libraries and structures in impressive manner for the era. Many European businessmen went to Hong Kong to do business. They were referred to as tai-pans or &quot;bigshot&quot;. One of the more notable Tai-pan hangout spots was the Hong Kong Club at Queen&#x27;s Road.

===Education===

In 1861, Frederick Stewart would become the founder of Hong Kong education system bringing Western-style pedagogy to the East. Some have argued that his contribution is the key turning point between the group of Chinese that were able to modernise Hong Kong versus the group that did not in China. The education would bring Western-style finance, science, history, technology into the culture. The father of modern China, Sun Yat-sen was also educated in Hong Kong&#x27;s Central School.

===Law and order===

In 1843 the legislative council was established. The governor of Hong Kong generally served as the British plenipotentiary in the far east in the early years. The Colonial Secretary would also assist in legal matters.
A colonial police force was established in the 1840s to handle the high crime rate in Hong Kong. By China&#x27;s standards, colonial Hong Kong&#x27;s code of punishment was considered laughably loose and lenient. The lack of intimidation may have been the leading cause for the continual rise in crime. Po Leung Kuk became one of the first organisations established to deal with the abduction of women and prostitution crisis. Crime at sea was also common as some pirates had access to cutlasses and revolvers. Court sessions for criminal and admiralty matters were first held on 4March 1844 under the aegis of the first governor, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pottinger and the Lieutenant-governor George D&#x27;Aguilar.

===Pandemics and disasters===

The Third Pandemic of bubonic plague broke out in China in the 1880s. By the spring of 1894 about 100,000 were reported dead in the mainland. In May 1894 the disease erupted into Hong Kong&#x27;s overcrowded Chinese quarter of Tai Ping Shan. By the end of the month, an estimated 450 people died of the illness. At its height, the epidemic was killing 100 people per day, and it killed a total of 2,552 people that year. The disease was greatly detrimental to trade and produced a temporary exodus of 100,000 Chinese from the colony. Plague continued to be a problem in the territory for the next 30 years.

In the 1870s a typhoon hit Hong Kong one evening, reaching its height by midnight. An estimated 2,000 people lost their lives in a span of just six hours.

==Economy==

===Transport===
The growth of Hong Kong depended greatly on domestic transport of citizens and cargo across Victoria Harbour. The establishment of the Star Ferry and the Yaumati Ferry would prove to be vital. In 1843 the colony had built the first ship at a private shipyard. Some of the customers later included the Spanish government in the Philippines and the Chinese navy. The Peak Tram would begin in 1888 along with the Tramway service in 1904. The first railway line was also launched in 1910 as the Kowloon-Canton Railway.
On land the rickshaws were extremely popular when they were first imported from Japan in 1874, since it was affordable and necessary for street merchants to haul goods. Sedan chairs were the preferred mode of the transport for the wealthy Europeans who lived on Victoria Peak due to the steep grade which ruled out rickshaws until the introduction of the Peak Tram. The first automobiles in Hong Kong had petrol-driven internal combustion engines and arrived between 1903 and 1905. Initially they were not well received by the public. Only around 1910 did the cars begin to gain appeal. Most of the owners were British. Buses operated by various independent companies flourished in the 1920s until the government formally issued franchises for the China Motor Bus and Kowloon Motor Bus companies in 1933.
The flying boats were the first British aeroplanes to reach Hong Kong in 1928. By 1924 the Kai Tak Airport would also be found. The first flight service from Imperial Airways would become available by 1937 at a price of 288 pounds per ticket.

===Hospitals and hospitality===

Soon after the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841, Protestant and Catholic missionaries started to provide social service. Italian missionaries began to provide boy-only education to British and Chinese youth in 1843. &quot;The Catholic French Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres&quot; was one of the first orphanage and elderly home was established in 1848.

In 1870 the Tung Wah Hospital became the first official hospital in Hong Kong. It handled much of the social services and was providing free vaccinations in Hong Kong Island and Kwang Tung. After raising funds for the 1877 famine in China, a number of the hospital officials became Tung Wah elites with much authority and power representing the Chinese majority.
Some of the booming hotel businesses of the era included the Victoria Hotel, New Victoria Hotel and the King Edward Hotel.

===Finance===

In 1864 the first large scale modern bank Hong Kong Shanghai Bank would be established turning Hong Kong into the focal point of financial affairs in Asia. Its chief manager, Sir Thomas Jackson, has a statue in Statue Square. The bank first leased Wardley House at HKD 500 a month in 1864. After raising a capital of HKD 5 million, the bank opened its door in 1865. The Association of Stockbrokers would also be established in 1891.

===Resources===

In December 1890 the Hongkong Electric company went into production with help from Catchick Paul Chater. It was the first step in allowing the transition of gas lamps to light bulbs. Other companies like Jardine Matheson would launch the &quot;Hong Kong Land Investment and Agency company Ltd&quot; accumulating a wealth as large as the entire government&#x27;s total revenue. (See also China Light and Power.)

==Politics==


One observer summed up the decades as &quot;politics, propaganda, panic, rumour, riot, revolution and refugees&quot;. The role of Hong Kong as a political safe haven for Chinese political refugees further cemented its status, and few serious attempts to revert its ownership were launched in the early 20th century. Both Chinese Communist and Nationalist agitators found refuge in the territory, when they did not actively participate in the turmoil in China. However, the dockworkers strikes in the 1920s and 1930s were widely attributed to the Communists by the authorities, and caused a backlash against them. A strike in 1920 was ended with a wage increase of HKD 32 cents.
Ambrose King, in his controversial 1975 paper &quot;Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong&quot;, described the colonial Hong Kong&#x27;s administration as &quot;elite consensual government&quot;. In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong&#x27;s administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them British honours, and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong&#x27;s horse racing clubs. He called this &quot;synarchy&quot;, an extension of John K. Fairbank&#x27;s use of the word to describe the mechanisms of government under the late Qing dynasty in China.
When modern China began after the fall of the last dynasty, one of the first political statements made in Hong Kong was the immediate change from long queue hairstyles to short haircuts. In 1938, Guangzhou fell to the hands of the Japanese, Hong Kong was considered a strategic military outpost for all trades in the far east. Though Winston Churchill assured that Hong Kong was an &quot;impregnable fortress&quot;, it was taken as a reality check response since the British Army actually stretched too thin to battle on two fronts.

<text>Daniel &quot;Terrible&quot; Turpin is a character published by DC Comics. Created by Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;New Gods&quot; #5 (November 1971).

Turpin is a supporting character of Superman and a member of the Metropolis police. Turpin has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily in association with Superman. Joseph Bologna voices the character in &quot;&quot;, where he is modeled after Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
In Turpin&#x27;s first appearance, he is one of the few citizens of Metropolis aware that a secretive war is taking place in the city between super-powered beings. When this war turns violent, Turpin&#x27;s boss tries to take him off the case, but Turpin ignores him. Turpin leads the fight against Kalibak, using the city&#x27;s energy to assist Lightray and Orion in defeating him. Turpin is injured, but survives.

He keeps his job and becomes Lieutenant Inspector of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit. In the third &quot;Superboy&quot; series, Turpin is sent to Hawaii to investigate whether they need a Special Crimes Unit of their own. While initially skeptical, a visit from the Female Furies convinces Turpin that the islands need an SCU. In later &quot;Superman&quot; titles, Turpin is loyal to Maggie Sawyer before her transfer to Gotham City. His romantic feelings for her fall apart when he learns she is lesbian.

He has spent a long time fighting threats in Metropolis; such as the rampaging group of mutants called the &#x27;Underworlders&#x27;.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Turpin investigates the case of several missing children and Orion&#x27;s death. He is possessed by Darkseid, but freed after Batman shoots him with a poisonous Radion bullet.

<doc id="1091948" wikidata="Q891382" url="?curid=1091948" title="Survival skills">
<text>Survival skills are techniques used to sustain life in any type of natural environment or built environment. These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life, including water, food, and . Survival skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over time.

Survival skills are basic ideas and abilities that ancient people invented and passed down for thousands of years. Today, survival skills are often associated with surviving in a disaster situation.

Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially to handle emergencies. Individuals who practice survival skills as a type of outdoor recreation or hobby may describe themselves as survivalists. Survival skills are often used by people living off-grid lifestyles such as homesteaders. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented but require many of the same skills.

== First aid ==
First aid (wilderness first aid in particular) can help a person survive and function with injuries and illnesses that would otherwise kill or compromise them. Common and dangerous injuries include:
* Bites from snakes, spiders, and other wild animals
* Bone fractures
* Burns
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Heart attack
* Hemorrhage
* Hypothermia and hyperthermia
* Infection from food, animal contact, or drinking non-potable water
* Poisoning from poisonous plants or fungi
* Sprains, particularly of the ankle
* Vomiting
* Wounds, which may become infected

The person may need to apply the contents of a first aid kit or, if possessing the required knowledge, naturally occurring medicinal plants, immobilize injured limbs, or even transport incapacitated comrades.

== Shelter ==

Many people who are forced into survival situations often have an elevated risk of danger because of direct exposure to the elements. Many people in survival situations die of hypothermia or hyperthermia, or animal attacks. An effective shelter can range from a natural shelter, such as a cave, overhanging rock outcrop, or a fallen-down tree, to an intermediate form of man-made shelter such as a debris hut, tree pit shelter, or snow cave, to a completely man-made structure such as a tarp, tent, or a longhouse. It is noted that some common properties between these structures are:

*Location (away from hazards, such as cliffs; and nearby materials, like food sources)
*Insulation (from the ground, rain, wind, air, or sun)
*Heat Source (either body heat or fire-heated)
*Personal or Group Shelter (having multiple individuals)

== Fire ==
Fire is a tool that helps meet many survival needs. A campfire can be used to boil water, rendering it safe to drink, and to cook food. Fire also creates a sense of safety and protection, which can provide an overlooked psychological boost. When temperatures are low, fire can postpone or prevent the risk of hypothermia. In a wilderness survival situation, fire can provide a sense of home in addition to being an essential energy source. Fire may deter wild animals from interfering with an individual, though some wild animals may also be attracted to the light and heat of a fire.

There are numerous methods for starting a fire in a survival situation. Fires are either started with the case of the solar spark lighter, or through a spark, as in the case of a flint striker. Fires will often be extinguished if either there is excessive wind, or if the fuel or environment is too wet. Lighting a fire without a lighter or matches, e.g. by using natural flint and metal with tinder, is a frequent subject of both books on survival and in survival courses, because it allows an individual to start a fire with few materials in the event of a disaster. There is an emphasis placed on practicing fire-making skills before venturing into the wilderness. Producing fire under adverse conditions has been made much easier by the introduction of tools such as the magnesium striker, solar spark lighter, and the fire piston.

== Water ==
A human being can survive an average of three to five days without water. Since the human body is composed of an average of 60% water, it should be no surprise that water is higher on the list than food. The need for water dictates that unnecessary water loss by perspiration should be avoided in survival situations. Perspiration and the need for water increase with exercise. Although human water intake varies greatly depending on factors like age and gender, the average human should drink about 13 cups or 3 liters per day. Many people in survival situations perish due to dehydration, and/or the debilitating effects of water-borne pathogens from untreated water.

A typical person will lose a minimum of two to four liters of water per day under ordinary conditions, and more in hot, dry, or cold weather. Four to six liters of water or other liquids are generally required each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep the body functioning properly. The U.S. Army survival manual does not recommend drinking water only when thirsty, as this leads to inadequate hydration. Instead, water should be consumed at regular intervals. Other groups recommend rationing water through &quot;water discipline.&quot;

A lack of water causes dehydration, which may result in lethargy, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces endurance and impairs concentration, which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Dark yellow or brown urine is a diagnostic indicator of dehydration. To avoid dehydration, a high priority is typically assigned to locating a supply of drinking water and making provisions to render that water as safe as possible.

Recent thinking is that boiling or commercial filters are significantly safer than the use of chemicals, with the exception of chlorine dioxide.

== Food ==
Culinary root tubers, fruit, edible mushrooms, edible nuts, edible beans, edible cereals or edible leaves, edible cacti, ants and algae can be gathered and, if needed, prepared (mostly by boiling). With the exception of leaves, these foods are relatively high in calories, providing some energy to the body. Plants are some of the easiest food sources to find in the jungle, forest, or desert because they are stationary and can thus be obtained without exerting much effort. Animal trapping, hunting, and fishing allow a survivalist to acquire high-calorie meat but require certain skills and equipment (such as bows, snares, and nets).

Focusing on survival until rescued, the Boy Scouts of America especially discourages foraging for wild foods on the grounds that the knowledge and skills needed to make a safe decision are unlikely to be possessed by those finding themselves in a wilderness survival situation.

When going on a hike or trip in an unfamiliar location, search and rescue advises to notify a trusted contact of your destination, your planned return time, and then notify them when returning. In the event you do not return in the specified time frame, (e.g. 12 hours of the scheduled return time), your contact can contact the police for search and rescue.

Survival situations can often be resolved by finding a way to safety, or a more suitable location to wait for rescue. Types of navigation include:
* Celestial navigation, using the sun and the night sky to locate the cardinal directions and to maintain course of travel
* Using a map, compass or GPS receiver
* Dead reckoning
* Natural navigation, using the condition of surrounding natural objects (i.e. moss on a tree, snow on a hill, direction of running water, etc.)

== Mental preparedness ==
Mental clarity and preparedness are critical to survival. The will to live in a life-and-death situation often separates those that live and those that do not. Even well-trained survival experts may be mentally affected in disaster situations. It is critical to be calm and focused during a disaster.

To the extent that stress results from testing human limits, the benefits of learning to function under stress and determining those limits may outweigh the downside of stress. There are certain strategies and mental tools that can help people cope better in a survival situation, including focusing on manageable tasks, having a Plan B available, and recognizing denial.

== Urban survival ==

===Earthquake===
Governments such as the United States and New Zealand advise that in an earthquake, one should &quot;Drop, Cover, and Hold.&quot;

New Zealand Civil Defense explains it this way:
*DROP down on your hands and knees. This protects you from falling but lets you move if you need to.
*COVER your head and neck (or your entire body if possible) under a sturdy table or desk (if it is within a few steps of you). If there is no shelter nearby, cover your head and neck with your arms and hands.
*HOLD on to your shelter (or your position to protect your head and neck) until the shaking stops. If the shaking shifts your shelter around, move with it.

The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) adds that in the event of a building collapse, it is advised that you:
* Seek protection under a structure like a table
* Cover your mouth with your shirt to filter out dust
* Don&#x27;t move until you are confident that something won&#x27;t topple on you
* Use your phone light to signal for help, or call

== Important survival items ==

Survivalists often carry a &quot;survival kit.&quot; The contents of these kits vary considerably, but generally consist of items that are necessary or useful in potential survival situations, depending on the anticipated needs and location. For wilderness survival, these kits often contain items like a knife, water vessel, fire-starting equipment, first aid equipment, tools to obtain food (such as snare wire, fish hooks, or firearms), a light source, navigational aids, and signaling or communications devices. Multi-purpose tools are often chosen because they serve multiple purposes, allowing the user to reduce weight and save space.

Preconstructed survival kits may be purchased from various retailers, or individual components may be bought and assembled into a kit.

==Controversial survival skills==
Some survival books promote the &quot;Universal Edibility Test.&quot; Allegedly, it is possible to distinguish edible foods from toxic ones by exposing your skin and mouth to progressively greater amounts of the food in question, with waiting periods and checks for symptoms between these exposures. However, many experts reject this method, stating that even a small amount of some &quot;potential foods&quot; can cause physical discomfort, illness, or even death.

Many mainstream survival experts have recommended the act of drinking urine in times of dehydration and malnutrition. However, the U.S. Army Survival Field Manual (FM 21–76) instructs that this technique is a myth and should never be used. There are several reasons to avoid drinking urine, including the high salt content of urine, potential contaminants, and the risk of bacterial exposure, despite urine often being touted as &quot;sterile.&quot;

Many classic western movies, classic survival books, and even some school textbooks suggest that using your mouth to suck the venom out of a venomous snake bite is an appropriate treatment. However, venom that has entered the bloodstream cannot be sucked out, and it may be dangerous for a rescuer to attempt to do so. Similarly, some survivalists promote the belief that when bitten by a venomous snake, drinking your urine provides natural anti-venom. Effective snakebite treatment involves pressure bandages and prompt medical treatment, and may require antivenom.

==Seizonjutsu==
Seizonjutsu (生存術) are survival skills such as gathering, hunting tracking etc. used in Ninjutsu and expertise in meteorology, botanics and training for physical strength to endure hardships in the outback.

<doc id="1091949" wikidata="Q311281" url="?curid=1091949" title="Anchisaurus">
<text>Anchisaurus is a genus of basal sauropodomorph dinosaur. It lived during the Early Jurassic Period, and its fossils have been found in the red sandstone of the Upper Portland Formation, Northeastern United States, which was deposited from the Hettangian age into the Sinemurian age, between about 200 and 192 million years ago. Until recently it was classed as a member of Prosauropoda. The genus name &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;αγχι&quot; (&#x27;) ; &quot;near, close&quot; + Greek (&#x27;); &quot;lizard&quot;. &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; was coined as a replacement name for &quot;&quot;Amphisaurus&quot;, which was itself a replacement name for Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Megadactylus&quot;&quot;, both of which had already been used for other animals.

==Discovery and naming==

Sauropodomorph remains were first documented in North America in 1818, when some bones nearly in length were uncovered by Mr. Solomon Ellsworth Jr. while excavating a well with gunpowder in East Windsor, Connecticut. At the time of their discovery it was thought that the bones might be those of a human, but the presence of tail vertebrae falsified that idea. They are now recognized as those of an indeterminate sauropodomorph, possibly more closely related to the plateosaurian prosauropods.

In 1855, the original type specimen of &quot;Anchisaurus polyzelus&quot;, AM 41/109, which is housed at the Amherst College Museum of Natural History, was found by William Smith in Springfield, Massachusetts during blasting a well for the waterhouse at the Springfield Armory. Unfortunately, both the East Windsor and Springfield specimens were severely damaged due to the blasting at the construction sites where they were found, and many of the bones were either accidentally thrown away by the workmen or kept by interested onlookers. As a result, these dinosaurs were only known from incomplete remains.

In 1863, the son of the ichnologist Edward Hitchcock, Edward Hitchcock Jr, described the Springfield remains in a supplement to his father&#x27;s work on fossil footprints, suggesting they could explain a certain mysterious kind of reptile tracks. He then contacted the British paleontologist Richard Owen. Owen advised him to name the finds as a new genus. Owen suggested the name &quot;Megadactylus&quot;, &quot;large finger&quot; in Greek, in reference to the enormous thumb of the animal. Hitchcock Jr himself then chose the specific name &quot;polyzelus&quot;, &quot;much sought for&quot; in Greek, referring to the fact that his father had for many years vainly sought to discover the identity of the track-maker.

In 1877, Professor Othniel Charles Marsh had noted that the name &quot;Megadactylus&quot; had been preoccupied by &quot;Megadactylus&quot; Fitzinger 1843, a subgenus of the lizard genus &quot;Stellio&quot;. In 1882, he replaced the name with &quot;Amphisaurus&quot;, &quot;near saurian&quot;, probably referring to Marsh&#x27;s interpretation of it as intermediate between primitive dinosaurs—at the time the British &quot;Palaeosaurus&quot; was an example of what was thought to be a primitive dinosaur—and more derived dinosaurs. In 1885, Marsh had discovered that this name also had been preoccupied, by the anthracosaurian &quot;Amphisaurus&quot; Barkas 1870, and again replaced it by &quot;Anchisaurus&quot;, with the same meaning.

Meanwhile, nearly complete specimens had been found in Manchester, Connecticut. In 1884, a series of bridges was built over the Hop Creek. Sandstone blocks were sawed out of Wolcott&#x27;s Quarry north of Buckland Station. On 20 October, an amateur paleontologist, Charles H. Owen, observed that a block had been removed containing the hind part of a skeleton. He warned Marsh who, using T. A. Bostwick as an intermediary, acquired the piece from the quarry owner, Charles O. Wolcott. Marsh tried to secure the front half of the skeleton but it had already been used in a bridge abutment. The specimen, YPM 208, was named &quot;Anchisaurus major&quot;, &quot;the larger one&quot;, by Marsh in 1889. Eventually, when the bridge was demolished in August 1969, John Ostrom would save the front block. Subsequently, two other dinosaur fossils were located in the quarry. Six metres south of the original find a second skeleton was visible in the quarry face. It was removed as a single block and given the inventory number YPM 1883. In Yale, the part containing the skull was split off and became specimen YPM 40313. In 1891, Marsh made &quot;Anchisaurus major&quot; a separate genus, &quot;Ammosaurus&quot;, the &quot;sand saurian&quot;. In the same publication he named YPM 1883/YPM 40313 as a new species of &quot;Anchisaurus&quot;, &quot;Anchisaurus colurus&quot;, &quot;the mangled one&quot;. They served as the templates from which O. C. Marsh in 1893 restored the skeleton. The Manchester specimens are now considered conspecific with &quot;Anchisaurus polyzelus&quot;. The East Windsor and Manchester specimens are housed at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

The type species is Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;A. polyzelus&quot;. Marsh&#x27;s &quot;A. major&quot; (also known as &quot;Ammosaurus&quot;), &quot;A. solus&quot;, and &quot;A. colurus&quot; (also known as &quot;Yaleosaurus&quot;), have since been recognized as synonyms of &quot;A. polyzelus&quot;, their supposed differences being due to misinterpretation and different stages of growth. In 2015, the ICZN formally made the more complete type specimen of &quot;A. colurus&quot; the neotype of the genus &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; and the species &quot;A. polyzelus&quot;, rendering &quot;A. polyzelus&quot; and &quot;A. colurus&quot; objective synonyms (both names being based on exactly the same fossil).

Broom named &quot;Gyposaurus capensis&quot; in 1911, from bones discovered in South Africa but Peter Galton renamed these &quot;Anchisaurus capensis&quot; in 1976. This species has since been reclassified again and is probably a juvenile of &quot;Massospondylus carinatus&quot;. &quot;G. sinensis&quot; was also referred here, but appears to be a distinct animal.

The Navajo Sandstone of Arizona is the same age as the Portland Formation, and has produced prosauropod remains that have been referred to as &quot;Ammosaurus&quot;. However, it is possible that these actually belong to the genus &quot;Massospondylus&quot;, otherwise known only from South Africa.

In the eastern Canadian province of Nova Scotia, scientists have unearthed prosauropods from the McCoy Brook Formation, which is about 200 to 197 million years old, from the Early Jurassic Hettangian stage. The Nova Scotia material provides clues about the diet of these animals. A large number of gastroliths, stones swallowed to grind up plant material in the gut, were found in the abdomen, as well as bone from the skull of a small sphenodont, &quot;Clevosaurus&quot;. This indicates that these dinosaurs were omnivorous, with a diet mainly consisting of plants but with an occasional supplement of meat. However, these remains have never been fully described or illustrated and were only tentatively referred to &quot;Ammosaurus&quot;. A further study identified them as a new taxon of sauropodomorph, &quot;Fendusaurus eldoni&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Anchisaurus&quot; was a rather small dinosaur, with a length of just over , which helps explain why it was once mistaken for human bones. It probably weighed around . However, Marsh&#x27;s species &quot;A. major&quot; (also known as &quot;Ammosaurus&quot;) was larger, from and some estimates give it a weight of up to . Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at and its weight at in 2010.

According to the presence of cf. &quot;Otozoum&quot; tracks on the Connecticut Valley, &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; could reach even greater sizes. &quot;Otozoum&quot; tracks were made by a semibipedal to quadrupedal sauropodomorph close to or on the line leading toward eusauropods. &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; is one of the two sauropodomorphs recognized in the zone. Based on the four known specimens of &quot;Anchisaurus&quot;, Yates estimated that the animal measured up to in length. This matches well with the estimated average size of the adult &quot;Eubrontes&quot; track-maker in the Hartford and Deerfield basins. Based on the largest known &quot;Eubrontes&quot; footprint, exceptionally large individuals of &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; probably measured up to in length.

==Classification==
Due to its primitive appearance, &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; was previously classified as a prosauropod, a member of a group of animals related to or ancestral to the sauropods. Recent investigations show that a group of traditional prosauropods form a monophyletic sister-group to Sauropoda, and that &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; is instead closer to sauropods.

The family Anchisauridae was first proposed by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1885 and later defined as a clade consisting of &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; and its nearest relatives. However, it is not clear which other genera are included in the family; many of the dinosaurs once included have since been moved elsewhere, and the group is not used in most current taxonomies.

==Paleobiology==
Fossils of &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; were originally discovered in the Portland Formation of the Newark Supergroup in the Connecticut River Valley. This formation preserves an arid environment with strong wet and dry seasons, from the Hettangian age into the Sinemurian age, between about 200 and 195 million years ago.

Digesting plant matter is a much more intensive biochemical process than digesting meat. This herbivore swallowed gastroliths (gizzard stones) to help break down the food in its stomach. Herbivorous dinosaurs needed a huge gut. Since this had to be positioned in front of the pelvis, balancing on two legs became increasingly difficult, as dinosaurs became larger and they gradually evolved into the quadrupedal position that characterizes the later sauropods such as &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. Prosauropods represented a middle phase between the earliest bipedal herbivores and the later giant sauropods. As a prosauropod, &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; was mostly typical of this group, which flourished briefly during the late Triassic and early Jurassic. &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; teeth, used to rip food, were shaped like spoons. It had fewer and more widely spaced teeth than true prosauropods, and as Peter Galton and Michael Cluver observed, narrower feet. &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; would have spent most of its time on four legs but could have reared up on its hind legs to reach higher plants.

As a facultative biped, &quot;Anchisaurus&quot; had to have multi-purpose front legs. As &#x27;hands&#x27;, they could be turned inwards and be used for grasping. It had a simple reversible first &#x27;finger&#x27;, similar to a &#x27;thumb&#x27;. As feet, the five toes could be placed flat against the floor and were strong at the ankle. This unspecialized design is typical of the early dinosaurs.

<text>Tzitzit ( &quot;ṣīṣīṯ&quot;, ; plural &quot;ṣīṣiyyōṯ&quot;, Ashkenazi: &#x27;; and [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]]:&#x27;) are specially knotted ritual fringes, or tassels, worn in antiquity by Israelites and today by observant Jews and Samaritans. are usually attached to the four corners of the &quot;tallit gadol&quot; (prayer shawl), usually referred to simply as a or ; and &quot;tallit katan&quot; (everyday undershirt). Through synecdoche, a may be referred to as .

==Etymology==

The word may derive from the Hebrew root [n-ts-h]. shares this root with the Hebrew for &#x27;lock of hair&#x27;. For example, in the Book of Ezekiel an angel grabs the prophet &quot;by the of [his] head;&quot; he could be said to be &quot;dragged by his hair.&quot;

A popular etymological interpretation of derives from another word which shares this root. ( &#x27;budding flower&#x27;) may once have referred to floral ornamentation on clothing. One can hear distinct similarities with contemporaneous Akkadian clothing vocabulary: (&#x27;thread&#x27;, &#x27;edge&#x27;, &#x27;loom&#x27;) or (a floral ornamentation). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the custom of making fringes from extending the threads of embroidery was common in the ancient Near East as the means of strengthening the fabric. The further analyses of the antique iconography suggest that apart from this pragmatic purpose the tassels could also decorate the cloth and as such be a marker of the social status: the more elaborate and elegant the fringes, the higher the position of the owner. In addition to this and given the unique nature of each of the tassels it could also be used as a personal &quot;signet&quot; for sealing documents. This data has led the scholars to assume that the practice itself is of very ancient origins and evolved into Jewish ritual clothing where it was invested with religious meaning.

The ending is the feminine adjectival suffix, used here to form a feminine singular noun. In the Hebrew Bible (), this noun is used to refer to one or many tassels, but later scholars used the feminine plural . In English-language academic texts on Judaica the term is sometimes translated as &quot;show-fringes&quot;. The Septuagint translation is &quot;tassels&quot; (Greek plural , from singular ).

==Torah sources==
The Five Books of Moses mention ritual fringes in two places:


Since the Hebrew word can mean &#x27;corner&#x27; or &#x27;border&#x27;, the specific place of the attachment of the fringes is unclear. Their exact number is also not specified. Lastly, the passage lacks any instructions on the binding of the fringes, save for the obligation to include &quot;a cord of blue&quot; (Heb. ). The lack of detail on these points suggests that the tying of was to a great extent Oral Torah until the third to first century BCE with the codifying of the Talmud.

The primary mnemonic purposes of this are expressed clearly: wearing reminds a daily practitioner to bring God&#x27;s love into action by practicing all other &quot;.&quot; The paragraph from Numbers is included in daily prayer as the final paragraph of the Shema. Here, also remind Jews that they are no longer slaves.

==Rabbinic Judaism==
The Talmud equates observance of with that of all the mitzvot. Maimonides includes it as a major commandment along with circumcision and the Passover offering.

The &quot;tallit&quot; and &quot;tallit katan&quot; are four-cornered garments worn by practicing Jews which incorporate . The garment itself is commonly referred to as .The tallit is typically worn over the shirt/ clothes, like a cloak, whereas the tallit katan (or arba kanfot) is smaller and worn underneath the clothing. It is a simplistic garment with a front and back fold, creating four corners to which the tzitzit are fastened. The blue thread mentioned in the Torah, &quot;tekhelet&quot;, is omitted by most Rabbinic Jews due to controversy over the dye-making process.

===Fabrics===
The medieval rabbis debated the source of the obligation for garments made from different types of fabric. All agree that garments made from wool or linen (the typical materials of Biblical garments) require by Biblical law. However, they debated whether the requirement is Biblical or rabbinic if the garment is made from any other material. The Shulchan Aruch ruled that this obligation is rabbinic, while the Rema ruled that it is Biblical.

The Torah forbids &quot;shatnez&quot; (&quot;intertying&quot; wool and linen together). However, unlike other forms of &quot;kil&#x27;ayim&quot; (combinations of various phenomena like planting different types of seed or ploughing with different animals), there is an exception to the rule: was not only allowed but required in the priestly garments, which combined dyed-wool and linen threads. According to the rabbis, this exemption to applied only while performing priestly service. Rabbinic Judaism (but not Karaite Judaism or Samaritanism) makes a further exemption to this law for , based on the Torah&#x27;s juxtaposition of the laws for and in Deuteronomy 22:11-12. Thus, according to rabbinic Judaism, both laymen and priests were supposed to wear mixtures of wool and linen all the time. From this perspective, the of the layman reflects that of the priest.

In practice, the rabbinic sages permitted using wool and linen strings in tandem only when what they hold to be genuine tekhelet is available.

===Threads and knots===

The tassel () on each corner is made of four strands, which must be made with intent. These strands are then threaded and hang down, appearing to be eight. (It is customary that each of the four strands is made of eight fine threads, known as ). The four strands are passed through a hole (or according to some: two holes) 1-2 inches (25 to 50 mm) away from the corner of the cloth. There are numerous customs as to how to tie the tassels. The Talmud explains that the Bible requires an upper knot () and one wrapping of three winds (). The Talmud enjoined that between seven and thirteen be tied, and that &quot;one must start and end with the color of the garment&quot;. As for the making of knots in between the , the Talmud is inconclusive, and as such later poskim have interpreted this requirement in various ways. The Talmud described tying assuming the use of dye. Following the loss of the source of the dye, various customs of tying were introduced to compensate for the lack of this primary element.

The tying method which gained the widest acceptance can be described as follows: The four strands of the are passed through a hole near the garment&#x27;s corner. The two groups of four ends are double-knotted to each other at the edge of the garment near the hole. One of the four strands (known as the ) is made longer than the others. The long end of the is wound around the other seven ends and double-knotted; this is done repeatedly so as to make a total of five double knots separated by four sections of winding, with a total length of at least four inches, leaving free-hanging ends that are twice that long This tying procedure is used for each of the garment&#x27;s four corners; if it has more than four corners, the four that are farthest apart are used.

In Ashkenazi custom, the four sections of winding number 7-8-11-13 winds, respectively. The total number of winds comes to 39, which is the same number of winds if one were to tie according to the Talmud&#x27;s instruction of 13 of 3 winds each. Furthermore, the number 39 is found to be significant in that it is the gematria (numerical equivalent) of the words: &quot;The Lord is One&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4). Others, especially Sephardi Jews, use 10-5-6-5 as the number of windings, a combination that represents directly the spelling of the Tetragrammaton (whose numerical value is 26).

Before tying begins, declaration of intent is recited: (&#x27;for the sake of the commandment of &#x27;).

===Interpretations===

Rashi, a prominent Jewish commentator, bases the number of knots on a gematria: the word (in its Mishnaic spelling, ) has the value 600. Each tassel has eight threads (when doubled over) and five sets of knots, totaling 13. The sum of all numbers is 613, traditionally the number of commandments in the Torah. This reflects the concept that donning a garment with reminds its wearer of all Torah commandments, as specified in Numbers 15:39. (Rashi knots are worn by the majority of Ashkenazic Eastern European Jews.)

Nachmanides disagrees with Rashi, pointing out that the Biblical spelling of the word () has the gematria of 590 rather than 600, which upends Rashi&#x27;s proposed gematria. He points out that in the Biblical quote &quot;you shall see &quot;it&quot; and remember them&quot;, the singular form &quot;it&quot; can refer only to the thread of . The strand serves this purpose, explains the Talmud, for the blue color of resembles the ocean, which in turn resembles the sky, which in turn is said to resemble God&#x27;s holy throne – thus reminding all of the divine mission to fulfill His commandments. (Nachmanides knots are worn by the majority of Sephardic Jews and Teimani Jews)

Modern Biblical scholar Jacob Milgrom notes than in ancient Middle Eastern societies, the corner of the garment was often elaborately decorated to &quot;ma[k]e an important social statement&quot;, functioning as a &quot;symbolic extension of the owner himself&quot;. He also notes that the Torah requires , normally a royal and priestly color, to be used by all Jews:
===Color of the strings===
====Tekhelet====
 () is a color dye which the Hebrew Bible commands the Jews to use for one, two, or four of the eight half-strings hanging down (as interpreted in Rabbinic Judaism), or a number of cords ranging from one up to the same number of threads as the non- threads (according to opinions in Karaite Judaism). At some point following the destruction of the Second Temple, the knowledge and tradition about the correct method of the dye was lost for Rabbinic Judaism in Israel and since then, most rabbinic diaspora Jews and Israeli Jews as well have worn plain white without any dyes. Tekhelet, which appears 48 times in the Tanakh – translated by the Septuagint as (, blue) – is a specific blue-violet dye produced, according to the rabbis, from a creature referred to as a Ḥillazon, other blue dyes being unacceptable. Some explain the black stripes found on many traditional prayer shawls as representing the loss of this dye.

While there is no prohibition on wearing blue dye from another source, the rabbis maintain that other kinds of do not fulfill the mitzvah of , and thus all the strings have been traditionally kept un-dyed (i.e., white) for many centuries. In recent times, with the (debated) re-discovery of the Ḥillazon in the &quot;Murex trunculus&quot; mollusk, some have noted that one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of without the strand. This position, however, has been strongly disputed. Others have disputed whether the coloring that comes from the &quot;Murex trunculus&quot; is the same as the biblical , based on the fact that according to traditional Jewish sources is supposed to be a dark shade of blue, while wool that was discovered in archaeological excavations and was found to have been colored with Murex dye is violet.

When is used, there are varying opinions in rabbinic literature as to how many of the strands are to be dyed: one of eight (Rambam), two of eight (Raavad), four of eight (Tosafot). While the white threads are to be made of the material of the garment, rabbinic law instructs that the -dyed thread must be made of wool.
According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the color of God&#x27;s Glory. Staring at this color aids in meditation, bringing us a glimpse of the &quot;pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity&quot;, which is a likeness of the Throne of God. Many items in the Mishkan, the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, such as the Menorah, many of the vessels, and the Ark of the Covenant, were covered with a blue-violet cloth when transported from place to place.
====The other threads====
The other threads in the (all the threads, where is not used) are described as &quot;white&quot;. This may be interpreted either literally (by Rama) or as meaning the same colour as the main garment (Rambam). Normally, the garment itself is white so that the divergence does not arise. Similarly the threads may be made either of wool or of the same fabric as the garment; again many authorities recommend using a woollen garment so that all views are satisfied.

===&quot;Tzitzit&quot; for women===
In rabbinic law, is considered a &quot;time-dependent positive commandment&quot;, as the Torah (Numbers 15:39) mentions &quot;seeing&quot; one&#x27;s , and one could not see them in the darkness of night, but rather only in daytime. In general, women are not required to perform time-dependent positive commandments, but may perform them if they choose to. Therefore, many Rishonim permitted women to wear (including Isaac ibn Ghiyyat, Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Baal HaMaor, Rambam, Raaviyah, Rashba, and Ra&#x27;ah). Similarly, the Shulchan Aruch rules that women may wear garments with . Opinions differ on whether women may make the blessing on such &quot;optional&quot; commandments; in general Ashkenazi women make the blessing, and Sephardic women do not.

At the same time, other Rishonim, beginning with R&#x27; Meir of Rothenburg, hold that women should not wear for various reasons. The Rema states that while women are technically allowed to don a , doing so would appear to be an act of arrogance (). The Maharil and the Targum Yonatan Ben Uziel view a garment with as a &quot;male garment&quot;, and thus forbidden to women as cross-dressing. Some other sources mention concern for &quot;shaatnez&quot; or carrying on shabbat.

The vast majority of contemporary Orthodox authorities forbid the donning of a by women, although Moshe Feinstein, Joseph Soloveitchik, and Eliezer Melamed approve women wearing in private, if their motivation is &quot;for God&#x27;s sake&quot; rather than motivated by external movements such as feminism. When the Satmar Rebbe&#x27;s wife died, she was found to be wearing (a ) under her clothes.

Women in Conservative Judaism have revived the wearing of the since the 1970s, usually using colors and fabrics distinct from the traditional garment worn by men. The Rabbinical Assembly has since formally approved the wearing and tying of by women. It has become common in Reform and other non-Orthodox streams for girls to receive a at their bat mitzvah, although some do not subsequently wear it on a regular basis. Other women have adopted the later in life, to connect with their communities, embody egalitarian values, or create a personalized connection to Judaism. It is rare for women to wear a .

==Karaite &quot;tzitzit&quot;==
Karaite Jews maintain that the must be braided and have the appearance of chains, rather than being knotted as are the of Rabbinic Judaism.

Karaites have blue-violet threads () in them. In contrast to rabbinic Jews, Karaites believe that the source can be any dye, except those produced from impure (a definition mostly overlapping &quot;un-kosher&quot;) species, such as the molluscs used by Rabbinic Jews. Instead, Karaites propose that the source of the dye was indigo or woad (&quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;). Karaites also consider synthetic blue or blue-violet to be acceptable for . Contrary to some claims, Karaites do not hang on their walls.

==Samaritan &quot;tzitzit&quot;==

In the Samaritan tradition, the is a gown worn over their clothes during most holy days, and the are the 22 &quot;buttons&quot; on the right lapel of the gown, and the corresponding loops on its left lapel. The are always in the same color as the gown, which is usually white.

Another version of Samaritan is the simple fringes on the sides of the very large white worn by the priests when carrying a Torah scroll.

Similarly to most Orthodox rabbinic Jews, the Samaritans hold that the blue-violet thread for their was produced from a specific dye, and claim that the tradition for producing it was lost.

Contrary to some rumors, the Samaritans do not use either rabbinic or Karaite .

==In archaeology and secular scholarship==

According to the modern documentary hypothesis, the reference to in Numbers comes from the Priestly Code, while that from Deuteronomy comes from the Deuteronomic Code. They are believed to date to around the late 8th century BCE and late 7th century BCE, respectively, some time after the practice became part of regular ritual. The custom however, clearly predates these codes, and was not limited to Israel. Images of the custom have been found on several ancient Near East inscriptions in contexts suggesting that it was practiced across the Near East.
While uses the Hebrew , employs the plural form of , which is an Akkadian loanword for a &#x27;cord&#x27; or &#x27;string&#x27;. The reason for this lexical change is open to speculation, yet, the scholars are inclined to assume that in the times when Deuteronomy was composed, the meaning of the of had been lost and the is a dynamic translation of an unusual term.

<text>The Royal Canberra Hospital implosion was a failed building implosion that killed one person and injured nine others. The implosion occurred on 13 July 1997, when the city&#x27;s superseded hospital buildings at Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin (that formerly constituted the Royal Canberra Hospital) were demolished to make way for the National Museum of Australia.

==Background==

The Royal Canberra Hospital closed on 27 November 1991 amid much controversy. Consultant physician Marcus de Laune Faunce wrote: &quot;Towards the end of 1990 many Canberra citizens were either bewildered, angered or saddened as they realised that the &quot;Royal Canberra Hospital&quot; on Acton Peninsula was soon to be closed. Its staffing structure and organisation were thought to have been planned in step with population needs and the hospital was firmly and warmly placed in the memories and affections of many people. Its beautiful, central position on the lake had been marked by Walter Burley Griffin on his original plan. After its formative years, it served Canberra for more than three decades as a first-class hospital staffed by hard-working, skilled and caring health workers. With its magnificent site and proximity to the Australian National University it had enormous potential as a future teaching hospital reflecting the best of Australian medical services.&quot;

==Implosion==

In April 1995 the Keating Government agreed in principle with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government to exchange certain sites of land within the ACT to facilitate the building of the National Museum. In July 1995 a feasibility study was undertaken for the demolition and clearance of the buildings on Acton Peninsula. On 4 August 1995 the ACT Cabinet approved a submission recommending the implosion method of demolition. On Friday 13 December 1996 the Prime Minister, John Howard, announced the design work on Acton Peninsula for the National Museum would begin immediately. The next day, a fence was erected around the site.

The demolition of the Canberra Hospital by way of implosion was billed as a spectator event by the ACT government. For this event, over 100,000 people, one of the largest crowds in Canberra&#x27;s history, were in attendance.

The implosion of the Royal Canberra Hospital was a disaster, with large pieces of debris reaching spectators situated 500 metres away on the opposite side of the Lake at a designated safe viewing location. A twelve-year-old girl, Katie Bender, was killed instantly, and nine other people were injured. Large fragments of masonry and metal were found 650 metres from the demolition site. The main building did not fully disintegrate and was manually demolished afterwards.

==Aftermath==
The ACT Government led by Chief Minister Kate Carnell was subject to sustained criticism, and a number of official inquiries were held. Many people complained the event should never have been made a public spectacle, as they felt this was inviting disaster. Other people felt that this was unfair, as implosions around the world generally excited local interest and had an enviable safety record.. Carnell gave her full approval to promote the implosion as a public event, drawing a near-record Canberra crowd.

ACT Work Cover is the authority responsible for administering, implementing and enforcing legislation in the Australian Capital Territory covering occupational health and safety (OH&amp;S), workers&#x27; compensation, dangerous substances and labour regulation. The coroner found that the authority did not follow established safety processes. It failed to ensure that the explosive workplan required by the ACT Demolition Code of Practice was met. It also failed to scrutinise departures from the original demolition workplans and to issue appropriate prohibition notices in accordance with the OH&amp;S Act to ensure the methodology was safe, not only to the workplace employees but also to the public.

The ACT Government has since carried out two bridge implosions without prior notice, as part of the Gungahlin Drive Extension project. The first one was carried out following an unexpected disruption to traffic, and the second one was carried at an early hour of a Saturday morning with a 1 km exclusion zone.

== In popular culture ==
The implosions were featured in news reel footage in the film &quot;Joe Cinque&#x27;s Consolation&quot; (2016).

<text>The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist) was a Nepalese political party. It was formed on 1 November 1991 by a group of former leaders of the original Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist) that had been expelled from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist). Initially, it was known as the Communist Party of Nepal (15 September 1949) but took the name Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist) after approximately one year of existence. Prabhunaryan Chaudhary was the chairman of the party.

== History ==
Ahead of the 1992 Nepalese local elections, the CPN (15 September 1949) took part in forming a front together with the Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal, Nepal Workers Peasants Party, Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist), and Nepal Communist League.

In the 1994 Nepalese general election, it had 49 candidates and polled 0.39% of the votes nationwide. In the 1999 Nepalese general election, it had 28 candidates, and got 0.094% of the votes nationwide. The students wing of the party was called Nepal Progressive Students Union and its trade union was the Nepal Trade Union Centre (NTUC). On 6 April, a major chunk of its membership (5.153) joined the CPN (UML).

In 2005, the party merged with the Communist Party of Nepal (United) and formed the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist).

<doc id="1091978" wikidata="Q4438427" url="?curid=1091978" title="Battle of Tendra">
<text>The Battle of Tendra (or the battle of [[Khadjibey]]) was a naval action fought on 8 and 9 September 1790 (28 and 29 August, O.S.) in the Black Sea as part of the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). It ended in a decisive victory for Ushakov&#x27;s Russians over the Ottomans.

==Battle==
The Russian fleet of 10 Ships of the line, 6 frigates and small craft sailed from Sevastopol on 5 September under Fyodor Ushakov for Kherson to pick up some frigates. At 6 a.m. on 8 September it encountered the Ottoman fleet of 14 battleships, 8 frigates and 23 small crafts at anchor near Tendra. As the Ottomans formed into a battle line, the Russian fleet sailed toward the tail end of the Ottoman line in 3 parallel lines, forming into one line as they did so.

The Ottoman admiral, Hussein Pasha, seeing his tail threatened, turned north and came back parallel to the Russians, who followed suit so the two fleets ended up on paralleled tracks, heading north-east. This was completed by about 2 p.m. Ushakov ordered 3 frigates to the off-battle side of the van to guard against an Ottoman doubling of the Russian line (Ottoman ships of the period were usually coppered and therefore several knots faster than Russian ships), leaving 13 ships of 710 guns in his line, opposed to 14 with 900 guns. Ushakov then turned toward the Ottoman ships and firing began at about 3 p.m.

The Ottomans began to bear away and by 6 p.m. were in full retreat. The Russians followed closely, inflicting much damage—in particular, the Ottoman Vice Admiral&#x27;s ship was attacked by &quot;Ioann Bogoslov&quot;, and the Admiral&#x27;s and Rear-Admiral&#x27;s ships by &quot;Rozhdestvo Christovo&quot; and &quot;Preobrazhenie Gospodne&quot;. The Ottomans speed allowed them to get away though, and soon after 8 p.m. firing ceased and the Russians anchored.

The next day, 2 damaged Ottoman ships, the &quot;Kapitana&quot; (Vice Admiral&#x27;s ship) and &quot;Melike Bahri&quot; were seen close by, and the Russians attacked. &quot;Melike Bahri&quot; surrendered to &quot;Maria Magdalina&quot; without resistance, but the &quot;Kapitana&quot; put up a stout resistance. At 10 a.m. she was attacked by &quot;Sv. Andrei Pervozvannyi&quot;, which brought down her fore topsail, then by &quot;Sv. Georgii Pobyedonosets&quot;, &quot;Preobrazhenie Gospodne&quot; and others. By noon she was completely surrounded, but fought on. At 2 p.m. Ushakov in &quot;Rozhdestvo Christovo&quot; shot away all her masts and placed his ship across her bows, and at 3 p.m. she surrendered. She was seen to be on fire, and blew up after only 20 men, including Said Bey and her captain, had been taken off. Only 101 men were saved out of 800 on board.

Some Russian ships had been chasing the rest of the Ottoman fleet but they were losing ground and at about 4:30 p.m. Ushakov recalled them. Russian privateers later brought in 3 small craft. Russian casualties were 25 killed and 25 wounded, and 733 Ottomans were captured. Several ships had minor damage in their masts and rigging. Russian victory in the Battle of Tendra allowed them to control the Black Sea, and Grigory Potemkin finally considered it possible to begin military action against the Vizier, leading eventually to the siege of Izmail.

Given the Navy service designation NK9, the &quot;Homare&quot; was also given the company designation NBA, Army experimental designation Ha-45 (ハ45) or, Army long designation Nakajima Army Type 4 1,900 hp Air-Cooled Radial and, (coincidentally) unified designation code of Ha-45.

==Design and development==
Development of the Homare started in 1940, and certification was completed in 1941. It succeeded Nakajima&#x27;s previous 14 cylinder Sakae (Ha-25) engine, which had its own forward seven cylinders staggered from the rear seven for efficient cooling.

The design was exceptionally compact, with an external diameter of 118 cm, a mere 3 cm larger than the Sakae. With a bore and stroke of 130 mm x 150 mm, it was classified as a short-stroke engine. It was designed to output around 1800 hp (1340 kW), or 100 hp (75 kW) per cylinder. However, the tight design of the engine made it difficult to maintain quality in manufacturing, and unreliability in the field was a significant problem; actual output of early models at altitude was in the range of 1300 hp (970 kW), far below the designed capability. Later models had improved performance, and it became one of the predominant powerplants of Japanese military aircraft in the latter part of the war. A total of 9089 were produced.

==Variants==
* Homare 11 - 1,650 hp (1,230 kW), 1,820 hp (1,357 kW), 1,900 hp (1,417 kW)
* Homare 12 - 1,825 hp (1,361 kW)
* Homare 21 - 1,990 hp (1,460 kW)

<text>Sostratus of [[Knidos|Cnidus]] (; ; born 3rd century BC) was a Greek architect and engineer. He is said to have designed the lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (c. 280 BC), on the island of Pharos off Alexandria, Egypt. This claim is disputed.

Strabo writes that the lighthouse was dedicated and presumably funded by Sostratus, a friend of Egypt&#x27;s ruler, Ptolemy. Pliny says that Sostratus was the architect and that Ptolemy graciously allowed him to &quot;sign&quot; the monument.

<text>Janes is an English patronymic family name. Its root is believed to be from the possessive of the given name &quot;Jan&quot; (see &quot;Jayne&quot;), &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Ian&quot;. In England, the name appears to have its densest roots in Bedfordshire and Gloucestershire as well as a few in the East End of London though migration has spread it across the country and the English-speaking world. There are two coats of arms associated with Janeses, one Gloucester-based and the other Kent-based. Janes is an uncommon given name. 

Equivalents exist in other languages, most often in pronunciation rather than spelling:
* Eanes
* Ianes
* Iōannēs (Greek)
* Janeš (Czech)

<doc id="1091997" wikidata="Q5513850" url="?curid=1091997" title="General Motors E platform">
<text>The General Motors E platform or E-body was the automobile platform designation used for a number of personal luxury cars produced from 1963 to 2002. Notably, early E-bodies were produced in both front wheel drive and rear wheel drive configurations, and were the first front wheel drive automobiles produced in the United States since 1937. The initial front-wheel drive E-platform power plant was referred to as the Unitized Power Package (UPP).

E-bodies were re-engineered to a smaller size in 1979, gaining a relationship to the FWD K-platform used in the Cadillac Seville. Later, the cars were made smaller still with the 1986 redesign, along with the K-body. Most 1986–1993 E-bodies were produced at GM&#x27;s high-tech Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant, with the Buick Reatta being built at the Lansing Craft Centre—then known as the Reatta Craft Centre. GM used the E-body designation until the Cadillac Eldorado ceased production in 2002.

The E-body was used as the basis for the V-body Cadillac Allanté luxury coupes. It also provided the front end of the GMC Motorhome and the Jetway 707 limousine.

This body shell designation was used for the following vehicles:

* 1963–1976 Buick Riviera (RWD)
* 1979–1985 Buick Riviera (FWD, longitudinal engine)
* 1986–1993 Buick Riviera (FWD, transverse engine)
* 1988–1991 Buick Reatta (FWD, transverse engine, shortened chassis)
* 1967–1985 Cadillac Eldorado (FWD, longitudinal engine)
* 1986–2002 Cadillac Eldorado (FWD, transverse engine)
* 1966–1985 Oldsmobile Toronado (FWD, longitudinal engine)
* 1986–1992 Oldsmobile Toronado (FWD, transverse engine)

Between 1983 and 1990, he was the regional secretary of the United Democratic Front and a member of the front&#x27;s national executive. During the negotiations to end apartheid, he worked at Shell House as the head of the ANC&#x27;s internal department of economic planning from 1991 to 1994.

Elected to the National Assembly in the first post-apartheid elections of April 1994, Manuel was also appointed as the Minister of Trade and Industry in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s Government of National Unity. During his two years in that portfolio, he championed South Africa&#x27;s post-apartheid economic liberalisation. He became Mandela&#x27;s Minister of Finance in a cabinet reshuffle in April 1996 and remained in that office for the next 13 years, serving throughout the terms of Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe. He presided over sustained economic growth in South Africa, which admirers credited partly to the market-friendly Growth, Employment and Redistribution policy of the National Treasury. Though his critics in the Tripartite Alliance derided him as neoliberal, others described him as a pragmatist.

After the April 2009 general election, Manuel was retained in President Jacob Zuma&#x27;s cabinet as Minister in the Presidency for the National Planning Commission. He oversaw the establishment of the commission, becoming its inaugural chairperson, and presided over the drafting of the National Development Plan 2030, which was adopted in 2012. He announced his retirement from politics ahead of the May 2014 general election. Since 2017, he has been the chairperson of Old Mutual Emerging Markets.

== Early life and education ==
Born on 31 January 1956, Manuel grew up in Kensington, a suburb of Cape Town. His parents were Philma van Söhnen, a garment worker, and Abraham James Manuel, who worked for the Cape Town City Council until he died when Manuel was 13. According to Manuel&#x27;s &quot;family legend&quot;, his great-grandparents were a Portuguese immigrant and a Khoekhoe woman; Manuel was classified as Coloured under apartheid.

He attended Windermere Primary School in Kensington and then Harold Cressy High School in District Six. He later said that &quot;politics came to me&quot; when his primary school class was halved by the implementation of the Bantu Education Act, and he was active in local civic organisations as a teenager. He also briefly joined the youth wing of the Labour Party in 1969, at the encouragement of his father, but dropped out due to &quot;peer pressure at school&quot; and due to his own disagreement with the party&#x27;s decision to participate in the Coloured Representative Council. After matriculating, he completed a tertiary diploma in civil and structural engineering at the Peninsula Technikon.

== Anti-apartheid activism ==
From 1974 to 1981, Manuel worked as a construction technician while maintaining his involvement in civic and anti-apartheid activism. He was initially attracted by the politics of the Black Consciousness Movement, but in 1979 he travelled to Botswana to join the exiled African National Congress (ANC), in his words hoping to become &quot;a revolutionary with a big beard and a big gun&quot;. The ANC turned him back to Cape Town, where in 1981 he became a full-time activist as the founding general secretary of the influential Cape Areas Housing Action Committee.

=== United Democratic Front ===
In 1983, Manuel was a founding member of the Western Cape branch of the United Democratic Front (UDF), a popular front against apartheid. In the same year, he was elected as the UDF&#x27;s regional secretary and as a member of its national executive committee; he held both positions until 1990. In 1996, Mark Gevisser described him as having been a &quot;solid workhorse of the UDF&quot;; in Gevisser&#x27;s description: He&#x27;s the one who, in the rough-and-tumble world of Cape Flats politics, once even punched out current Western Cape Nat MEC Peter Marais at a public meeting; the long-haired biker who used to cruise around in tight Lee jeans, studded shoes and leather jacket. He&#x27;s the one who used to lead the klaberjas sessions in Victor Verster prison... he was a rough-hewn United Democratic Front street-activist.Because of his political activities, Manuel spent a cumulative 35 months in police detention between 1985 and 1990. He was detained for the first time on 22 October 1985, held under the Internal Security Act, and released a month later under a stringent banning order. On the next occasion, he was held at Victor Verster without trial for almost two years, from August 1986 to July 1988, then rearrested from September 1988 to February 1989. Again released on a banning order, he was arrested once again in August 1989, and held for two months, after he contravened the order by speaking at a press conference in Athlone. Also during this period in 1989, Manuel returned briefly to the private sector as a policy manager for the Mobil Foundation in Cape Town.

=== African National Congress ===
In February 1990, the apartheid government unbanned the ANC to facilitate negotiations to end apartheid, and Manuel was appointed as the party&#x27;s deputy coordinator in the Western Cape while legal party structures were established. He was elected as the regional branch&#x27;s publicity secretary when the first regional party conference was held. However, he was soon promoted: the national ANC held its first conference inside South Africa in Durban in July 1991 and Manuel was elected to the party&#x27;s top executive organ, the National Executive Committee; by number of votes received, he was ranked 19th of the committee&#x27;s 50 members, receiving support across 64 per cent of all ballots cast. He was also elected to the ANC National Working Committee.

In the aftermath of the conference, he was recruited full-time to the ANC&#x27;s headquarters at Shell House, where he was head of the party&#x27;s nascent department of economic planning. He worked closely with Tito Mboweni, who took responsibility for trade and industrial policy while Manuel focused on fiscal policy. Because of his lack of experience in economics, Manuel&#x27;s appointment received a dubious reaction from the press, from his friends, and from Manuel himself. Manuel later said that he thought he had been chosen for the department because he was ideologically &quot;agnostic&quot; on questions of policy; in the description of his UDF colleague, Cheryl Carolus, he &quot;had a remarkable ability to listen, to figure out what he needed to achieve, and then to go for it without ideological baggage. He was thorough and conservative, always the voice of reason.&quot; In addition, Mark Gevisser considered Manuel a protégé of Thabo Mbeki and noted that Manuel was politically successful in the ANC because he was &quot;one of the few people comfortable in both the ex-UDF nexus around Cyril Ramaphosa – his natural home – and the exile nexus around Mbeki&quot;.

He remained the ANC&#x27;s head of economic planning until the 1994 general election. According to Gevisser, during this period, Manuel &quot;played a critical role in guiding the ANC away from its traditional adherence to centralised planning and towards the market economy it was to espouse&quot;.

== Minister of Trade and Industry: 1994–1996 ==
In South Africa&#x27;s first post-apartheid elections in April 1994, Manuel stood as a candidate for the ANC and was elected to the National Assembly, the lower house of the new South African Parliament. He was also appointed as Minister of Trade and Industry in the Government of National Unity under President Nelson Mandela. He said that his priorities would include aligning trade policy and industrial strategy; seizing opportunities &quot;to open up our domestic market to international competition&quot;, thus reversing the isolation of the apartheid era; and encouraging long-term investments in human and other capital. He also announced in December 1994 that he would seek to strengthen competition policy to reduce barriers to entry and eliminate monopolistic collusion.

According to observers, his greatest achievement &quot;was to take a department whose sole raison d&#x27;être [under apartheid] was to stifle competition, and make it the vanguard of a &#x27;liberalised&#x27; market economy&quot;, among other things by embracing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and reducing tariffs and other protectionist measures. However, his support for liberalisation made him unpopular with trade unions, including the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers&#x27; Union and other members of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the ANC&#x27;s Tripartite Alliance partner.

During this period, in December 1994, the ANC&#x27;s 49th National Conference elected Manuel to his second term as a member of the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee. By number of votes received, he was ranked 17th of the 60 members elected to the committee.

== Minister of Finance: 1996–2009 ==

On 28 March 1996, President Mandela announced that Chris Liebenberg had resigned as the Minister of Finance and would be replaced by Manuel, with Gill Marcus as his deputy. He took office on 4 April. Manuel noted that his appointment was &quot;something different&quot; for the business community: describing himself, he acknowledged, &quot;he&#x27;s young, he&#x27;s black, he&#x27;s uppity, he&#x27;s given other people shit.&quot; Despite this uncertain start, he was retained in the ministry in the first and second cabinets of Mandela&#x27;s successor, President Thabo Mbeki; according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Mbeki&#x27;s decision to keep him on was &quot;widely applauded by the business community&quot;.

=== Economic policy ===
At the time of his appointment to the ministry, Manuel said that he was a Keynesian and did not believe that &quot;fiscal discipline is an end in itself&quot;. However, he later acknowledged that, when he took office in 1996, debt reduction was one of the government&#x27;s major priorities, as debt servicing costs were the largest budget item. According to Manuel, macroeconomic reforms were the necessary solution, because South Africa wanted to avoid becoming a &quot;client state of anybody&quot; and therefore to avoid heavy borrowing from the Bretton Woods institutions. Soon into his tenure, on 14 June 1996, he announced the government&#x27;s new Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) programme, which was viewed as its critics as a marked rightward shift from the Reconstruction and Development Programme; GEAR targeted the reduction of the budget deficit to three per cent, more rapid tariff reductions, constraints on the public sector wage bill, and other so-called market-friendly measures. 
South Africa recorded its first-ever budget surplus in the 2006/2007 financial year, and economic growth in South Africa was generally very strong throughout Manuel&#x27;s tenure. His economic management won the approval of the opposition Democratic Alliance. However, leftist elements of the Tripartite Alliance vilified GEAR – and Manuel – as part of the neoliberal &quot;1996 class project&quot;. Even those broadly complimentary of Manuel&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Finance noted that his ministry had failed to address structural economic problems, particularly poverty, unemployment, and inequality. Responding to this complaint in April 2014, Manuel said:
No, I don&#x27;t think finance ministers can take responsibility for all of those things... You see, one of the misplaced issues regarding economic discourse in this country is that there&#x27;s this belief that macroeconomics is everything. Economists would use their own arcane language and say macro-economic stability is a &quot;necessary&quot; but not a &quot;sufficient&quot; condition. You need a series of structural policies that are not macro. And those are out of the purview of any minister of finance.
Long regarded as a pragmatist, Manuel said in 2013 that he still had little technical knowledge of economics, but &quot;I knew that if I set this thing up where people can come with the numbers, and I ask the questions based on life experience and understanding and broad political objectives, then it will work.&quot; He was also commended for his prominent international profile; among other positions, he was Ban Ki-Moon&#x27;s special envoy for development finance and the chairperson of a committee established by the International Monetary Fund to consider organisational and governance reform of the fund.
=== ANC National Executive Committee ===
During his tenure as Finance Minister, Manuel remained a popular member of the ANC National Executive Committee. He was re-elected ranked seventh in December 1997 and ranked first in December 2002. At the December 2007 elective congress, the 52nd National Conference in Polokwane, he was one of only a handful of Mbeki&#x27;s cabinet who was re-elected, in Manuel&#x27;s case ranked 57th of 80. At the same conference, Mbeki was deposed as ANC president by his deputy, Jacob Zuma, intensifying severe divisions in the party. Richard Calland said that, amid uncertainty about the consequences of the upset, &quot;the anxiety is distilled into one question: Will Zuma keep Trevor Manuel as minister of finance?&quot;

===Resignation and re-appointment===
On 20 September 2008, Mbeki announced that he would resign as President of South Africa at the request of the ANC. On 23 September, his office announced that Manuel was among the 13 cabinet ministers who had submitted their own resignations in response. The rand declined in value by more than 2.5 per cent, the largest decline in four years. However, markets recovered when, less than an hour later, Manuel&#x27;s spokesperson announced that he would be willing to continue to serve under Mbeki&#x27;s successor. The spokesperson said that Manuel had &quot;felt duty-bound&quot; to resign, and he later explained that &quot;I wanted whoever was going to take over to make his or her own decision as to who will be finance minister.&quot; Kgalema Motlanthe was elected as president on 25 September and he retained Manuel as Finance Minister in his cabinet.

The aftermath of Mbeki&#x27;s resignation also saw the formation of an ANC breakaway, the Congress of the People (COPE), by Mbeki&#x27;s supporters. Over a decade later, former COPE spokesperson and journalist JJ Tabane alleged that Manuel had been &quot;in the background&quot; during COPE&#x27;s formation; Manuel strongly denied any involvement and threatened to sue Tabane for defamation.

=== Later controversies ===
After Manuel departed the Ministry of Finance in 2009, it became a target of political attacks which sometimes implicated Manuel. In August 2015, the &quot;Business Day&quot; published a document which implicated Manuel in an elaborate conspiracy codenamed Project Spider Web, apparently hatched during the post-apartheid transition with the aim of maintaining the influence of the white establishment over the National Treasury and South African economic policy. The document, of unknown origin but purporting to be a leaked intelligence report, had been circulating in government circles and claimed that other conspirators included Maria Ramos, Manuel&#x27;s wife and his former director-general in the Treasury, as well as several other senior Treasury officials. The National Treasury said the document was &quot;baseless and vexatious&quot; and &quot;appears calculated to sow seeds of suspicion and may be motivated by an unexplainable desire to undermine and destabilise the institution [the Treasury]&quot;. No evidence was ever provided to support the claims and no formal investigation was launched. The business press viewed the report as part of a smear campaign and an attempt to weaken the Treasury to facilitate its capture by business interests.

In October 2016, the &quot;Citizen&quot; reported, based on access to a leaked document, that Manuel had approved a R100-million modernisation contract that had been awarded at the South African Revenue Service (SARS) without a proper bidding process.

In August 2017, Manuel and his one-time Deputy Finance Minister, Jabu Moleketi, were questioned by the Hawks in their investigation into the activities of the so-called SARS rogue unit, an elite investigative unit that was alleged to have spied on politicians and citizens. Manuel was finance minister at the time that the investigative unit was established by Pravin Gordhan, then the SARS Commissioner and later Manuel&#x27;s politically embattled successor as finance minister. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) accused Manuel of complicity in the &quot;rogue unit&quot;, though the allegations, strongly denied by Manuel, were considered by media as another part of the attempt to delegitimise the Treasury and facilitate state capture.

== Minister in the Presidency: 2009–2014 ==
After the April 2009 general election, Motlanthe was succeeded as president by Jacob Zuma, who appointed Manuel to his cabinet as one of two Ministers in the Presidency. While Collins Chabane would be responsible for performance monitoring, evaluation, and administration, Manuel would be responsible for long-term strategic planning through the new National Planning Commission, the establishment of which was also announced during Zuma&#x27;s cabinet announcement.

Manuel&#x27;s appointment to the new portfolio was generally welcomed. However, early in his tenure, opposition parties criticised him for using R1.2 million in public money to purchase a luxury BMW as a ministerial vehicle. Manuel later conceded that the purchase was &quot;an error of judgement&quot;.

=== National Development Plan ===
Manuel&#x27;s ministry published a green paper on national strategic planning in September 2009. Cosatu called for it to be withdrawn, with Zwelinzima Vavi warning that Manuel would become a de facto &quot;imperial&quot; prime minister and would marginalise other ministries and the Tripartite Alliance. In particular, Cosatu was concerned that Manuel&#x27;s wide-ranging portfolio trenched on the authority of the Minister of Economic Development, former trade unionist Ebrahim Patel, who it held should be responsible for long-term economic planning.

Nonetheless, when President Zuma announced the composition of the inaugural 24-member National Planning Commission on 30 April 2010, Manuel was appointed as chairperson, with businessman Cyril Ramaphosa as his deputy. The commission published a draft National Development Plan for public consultation in November 2011, and the final plan was adopted by Parliament in August 2012 and by cabinet the following month. In the remaining eighteen months of the legislative term, Manuel oversaw the government&#x27;s preparations to implement the plan. During this period, he was also a member of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations, chaired by Pascal Lamy.

===Spat with Jimmy Manyi===

On 2 March 2011, Manuel published an open letter to Jimmy Manyi, the head of the Government Communication and Information System, accusing Manyi of being &quot;a racist in the mould of H. F. Verwoerd&quot;. The letter was a response to Manyi&#x27;s suggestion that, in order to avoid being negatively affected by proposed changes to employment equity laws, Coloured people should &quot;spread&quot; through the provinces of South Africa to address &quot;this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape&quot;. Manuel&#x27;s letter to Manyi received international media attention for its ferocity, and other ANC leaders supported Manuel, with Kader Asmal urging that, &quot;Minister Manuel deserves the support and praise of all right-thinking South Africans. The choice facing us is very clear: do we stand behind the humane and generous values of Minister Manuel, or do we, by staying silent, lend our support to the mischievous and dangerous notions of Mr Manyi.&quot;

However, the ANC Youth League professed itself &quot;disturbed&quot; by Manuel&#x27;s letter, saying, &quot;We now do not know who Trevor Manuel represents, because his remarks falls squarely into the political agenda of right-wing political forces opposed to the ANC&quot;. Manuel&#x27;s letter also drew a sharp response from Paul Ngobeni, who, writing in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, called for Manuel to be fired. Ngobeni accused Manuel of being &quot;a gangster of the worst kind&quot;, of acting as though he was &quot;the king of Coloured people&quot;, and of seeking to undermine President Zuma and his cabinet through his &quot;cowardly, unwarranted and racist attacks on Manyi&quot;.

=== Retirement ===
Manuel concluded his 21-year tenure on the ANC National Executive Committee in December 2012, when he declined a nomination to stand for re-election at the ANC&#x27;s upcoming 53rd National Conference. His announcement immediately sparked speculation that he intended to retreat from public life.

In March 2014, when Parliament closed for recess ahead of that year&#x27;s general election, Manuel announced his retirement from politics. He told the house that, &quot;At some point serving leadership must give way so that new blood, fired up with life-changing ideas, can take society to a higher level of development&quot;. His decision was linked to his reduced political influence under the Zuma administration, and the &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; concluded that he had retired &quot;partly because he realised that, in Zuma, he did not have the kind of political backing required to implement the National Development Plan&quot;. 

== Later career ==
After leaving Parliament, Manuel took up various pursuits in business. On 1 October 2014, he was appointed as senior adviser to the global Rothschild Group and as deputy chairman of its South African subsidiary; in March 2017, he succeeded Bruce Hemphill as chairman of Old Mutual Emerging Markets. He also held non-executive directorships elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Manuel retained his public profile, including as a critic of President Zuma. In April 2016, in an interview with Soweto TV, he said that it would be &quot;in all of our interests that the president actually steps aside&quot;, and he was critical of Zuma&#x27;s administration during his testimony to the Zondo Commission in February 2019. Speaking on Radio 702 in May 2022, Manuel said that he had allowed his ANC membership to lapse, reflecting that in retrospect &quot;the magic, the stance of moral leadership that had shaped the ANC throughout my youth was gone&quot; after the party&#x27;s Polokwane conference.

However, Manuel returned to public service in advisory capacities after Zuma was succeeded as president by Cyril Ramaphosa, Manuel&#x27;s former deputy at the National Planning Commission. In February 2019, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni appointed Manuel to chair the panel tasked with appointing a new SARS commissioner. The EFF alleged in a statement that Manuel presided over a &quot;nepotistic&quot; and &quot;corrupt&quot; process, remarks later found to be defamatory by the Pretoria High Court. In April 2018, Ramaphosa appointed Manuel as one of his four investment envoys, and, two years later, now in his capacity as Chairperson of the African Union, Ramaphosa appointed Manuel as one of four special envoys tasked with securing international aid for Africa&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On the latter occasion, the EFF called for the African continent to reject Manuel&#x27;s appointment, calling him a &quot;puppet&quot; of &quot;white monopoly capital&quot;.

In late 2024, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Manuel to group of experts to promote actionable policy solutions and galvanize political and public support required to resolve the developing world’s debt crisis, chaired by Mahmoud Mohieldin. 

==Personal life==
In 1985, Manuel married Lynne Matthews, with whom he had three sons. They separated in 2001, beginning divorce proceedings that were finalised in 2007. At the time, Manuel was rumoured to have had an extramarital affair with Maria Ramos, the director-general in his ministry. He married Ramos on 27 December 2008 in Franschhoek.

== Selected honours ==
The World Economic Forum selected Manuel as a Global Leader for Tomorrow in 1994, and he was &quot;Euromoney&quot;&#x27;s African Finance Minister of the Year in 1997. In May 2008, he was appointed the inaugural chancellor of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, which had recently absorbed his own alma mater, the Peninsula Technikon. He served two terms as chancellor, a largely ceremonial position, before he was succeeded by Thandi Modise in 2017.

<text>Alexander Dennis is a British bus manufacturing company based in Larbert, Scotland. The largest bus and coach manufacturer in the United Kingdom, with a 50% market share in 2019, it has manufacturing plants and partnerships in Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the United States.

==History==
===TransBus - the precursor of Alexander Dennis===

Mayflower Corporation acquired Scottish bus-makers, Walter Alexander, in August 1995 and English bus-makers, Dennis Group, in October 1998. In 2000, Mayflower and Henlys Group merged their British bus-making operations into a 70:30 joint venture with Alexander, Dennis and Henlys&#x27; Plaxton merged to form TransBus International. The factories concerned employed 3,300 staff in seven places in England (Anston, Guildford, Scarborough and Wigan), Scotland (Falkirk) and Northern Ireland (Belfast).

Plaxton&#x27;s Scarborough operations was planned to close on 3 May 2001 with the loss of 700 jobs blamed on the fall in tourism after the foot and mouth epidemic broke out. Minibus production was moved to the former Walter Alexander factory at Falkirk. However, the Scarborough factory did not close altogether, for 200 staff returned to work after the summer break.

Mayflower was valued at £700 million in 1999. By March 2004, that stock market valuation had fallen to £22 million. The following month Mayflower was placed in administration, amid accusations of four years of falsifying crucial company records as to customers&#x27; payments to HSBC, counting the same income twice. One outcome was that certain members of the Dennis pension fund would receive only 40 per cent of their pensions, though others would continue to receive their full entitlement. TransBus was also placed in administration.

TransBus Plaxton was sold to in a management buyout to Brian Davidson and Mike Keane with the support of a private equity group.

===Formation of Alexander Dennis===



A group of Scottish investors, Noble Grossart, David Murray, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, purchased the business from administrator Deloitte in May 2004.

The former Alexander Belfast plant was not included in the deal and closed. Alexander Dennis ultimately inherited a number of plants from TransBus: the former Alexander factories in Falkirk, Scotland; the Dennis factory in Guildford and later the former Plaxton factories in Anston and Scarborough. The former Northern Counties factory in Wigan closed in January 2005.

Dennis Group had produced a range of both bus and coach chassis and bodies as well as fire engines. Included among its range of chassis were the Dennis Dart and Dennis Trident. They also produced export variants for service in Hong Kong, Singapore and other locations. Plaxton made coaches, as well as the President double decker body (built on Trident, DAF DB250 and Volvo B7TL chassis) and the single decker Pointer body, built on the Dart chassis.

In May 2007, Alexander Dennis purchased Plaxton, thus reuniting the two former TransBus businesses.

In October 2008, Alexander Dennis signed a deal with ElDorado National to assemble the Enviro500 for the United States market. In 2011, Alexander Dennis entered an agreement with Kiwi Bus Builders to assemble its products for the New Zealand market.

In May 2012, NFI Group and Alexander Dennis announced a new joint-venture to design and manufacture medium-duty low-floor bus (or midi bus) for the North American market. New Flyer would handle production and marketing, and Alexander Dennis would handle the engineering and testing. The joint venture was dissolved in 2017. In June 2012, Alexander Dennis acquired Australian bodybuilder Custom Coaches. However, in May 2014, Custom Coaches was placed into administration and later sold to a consortium headed by its former owner.

In 2015 Alexander Dennis established an assembly plant in Vaughan, Ontario for orders to Metrolinx. In October 2015, Alexander Dennis signed a deal with BYD to body electric buses. From 2021, Alexander Dennis will build its own electric chassis.

===NFI Group era===

In May 2019, Alexander Dennis was sold to NFI Group, in a deal worth £320 million. Souter Investments retain an interest, taking shares in NFI Group as part of the transaction. The two companies had been engaged in a joint venture from 2012 until 2017.

In August 2020, Alexander Dennis announced plans to cut 650 jobs from its UK manufacturing sites including Falkirk, Scarborough and Guildford, citing a demand drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bus chassis production moved from Guildford to Falkirk.

June 2021 saw Alexander Dennis open a base in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, which was described by local media as &quot;boosting economic growth&quot;.

In July 2021, Alexander Dennis announced plans for construction of a new staff office complex and museum in Farnborough, Hampshire named &quot;Trident House&quot;. The centre was expected to be completed in early 2022. Alexander Dennis also entered a business partnership with Australian electric bus supplier Nexport to assemble electric city buses locally, with Australian manufacturing expected to begin in early 2022.

In April 2022, Alexander Dennis commenced trials of an autonomous Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC working with Stagecoach Group, as part of a two-week pilot. Two months later in June, the company formally opened its Trident House complex, while at the same time, launched a refresh of its brand identity.

After building a batch of Enviro400FCEV buses in a pilot scheme at the site in 2022, Alexander Dennis announced it would expand its Larbert headquarters by converting on-site warehouse space to bus manufacturing facilities. Production of the second-generation Alexander Dennis Enviro400EV is planned to begin at Larbert from August 2023, taking the company&#x27;s manufacturing footprint in the United Kingdom to three sites.

<doc id="1092012" wikidata="Q3813668" url="?curid=1092012" title="Quantization (image processing)">
<text>Quantization, involved in image processing, is a lossy compression technique achieved by compressing a range of values to a single quantum (discrete) value. When the number of discrete symbols in a given stream is reduced, the stream becomes more compressible. For example, reducing the number of colors required to represent a digital image makes it possible to reduce its file size. Specific applications include DCT data quantization in JPEG and DWT data quantization in JPEG 2000.

== Color quantization ==
Color quantization reduces the number of colors used in an image; this is important for displaying images on devices that support a limited number of colors and for efficiently compressing certain kinds of images. Most bitmap editors and many operating systems have built-in support for color quantization. Popular modern color quantization algorithms include the nearest color algorithm (for fixed palettes), the median cut algorithm, and an algorithm based on octrees.

It is common to combine color quantization with dithering to create an impression of a larger number of colors and eliminate banding artifacts.

== Grayscale quantization ==
Grayscale quantization, also known as gray level quantization, is a process in digital image processing that involves reducing the number of unique intensity levels (shades of gray) in an image while preserving its essential visual information. This technique is commonly used for simplifying images, reducing storage requirements, and facilitating processing operations. In grayscale quantization, an image with &quot;N&quot; intensity levels is converted into an image with a reduced number of levels, typically &quot;L&quot; levels, where &quot;L&quot;&lt;&quot;N&quot;. The process involves mapping each pixel&#x27;s original intensity value to one of the new intensity levels. One of the simplest methods of grayscale quantization is uniform quantization, where the intensity range is divided into equal intervals, and each interval is represented by a single intensity value. Let&#x27;s say we have an image with intensity levels ranging from 0 to 255 (8-bit grayscale). If we want to quantize it to 4 levels, the intervals would be [0-63], [64-127], [128-191], and [192-255]. Each interval would be represented by the midpoint intensity value, resulting in intensity levels of 31, 95, 159, and 223 respectively.

The formula for uniform quantization is:

formula_1
Where:

* &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the quantized intensity value.
* &quot;x&quot; is the original intensity value.
* Δ is the size of each quantization interval.

Let&#x27;s quantize an original intensity value of 147 to 3 intensity levels.

Original intensity value: &quot;x&quot;=147

Desired intensity levels: &quot;L&quot;=3

We first need to calculate the size of each quantization interval:

formula_2

Using the uniform quantization formula:

formula_3

formula_4

formula_5

Rounding 191.25 to the nearest integer, we get formula_6

So, the quantized intensity value of 147 to 3 levels is 191.

== Frequency quantization for image compression ==

The human eye is fairly good at seeing small differences in brightness over a relatively large area, but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency (rapidly varying) brightness variation. This fact allows one to reduce the amount of information required by ignoring the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This is the main lossy operation in the whole process. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers.

As human vision is also more sensitive to luminance than chrominance, further compression can be obtained by working in a non-RGB color space which separates the two (e.g., YCbCr), and quantizing the channels separately.

=== Quantization matrices ===

A typical video codec works by breaking the picture into discrete blocks (8×8 pixels in the case of MPEG). These blocks can then be subjected to discrete cosine transform (DCT) to calculate the frequency components, both horizontally and vertically. The resulting block (the same size as the original block) is then pre-multiplied by the quantization scale code and divided element-wise by the quantization matrix, and rounding each resultant element. The quantization matrix is designed to provide more resolution to more perceivable frequency components over less perceivable components (usually lower frequencies over high frequencies) in addition to transforming as many components to 0, which can be encoded with greatest efficiency. Many video encoders (such as DivX, Xvid, and 3ivx) and compression standards (such as MPEG-2 and H.264/AVC) allow custom matrices to be used. The extent of the reduction may be varied by changing the quantizer scale code, taking up much less bandwidth than a full quantizer matrix.

This is an example of DCT coefficient matrix: 

:formula_7

A common quantization matrix is: 

:formula_8

Dividing the DCT coefficient matrix element-wise with this quantization matrix, and rounding to integers results in:

:formula_9

For example, using −415 (the DC coefficient) and rounding to the nearest integer

:formula_10

Typically this process will result in matrices with values primarily in the upper left (low frequency) corner. By using a zig-zag ordering to group the non-zero entries and run length encoding, the quantized matrix can be much more efficiently stored than the non-quantized version.

<doc id="1092016" wikidata="Q3007294" url="?curid=1092016" title="Culture of Somalia">
<text>The culture of Somalia encompasses the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, and customs of the Somali people throughout history and is distinguished by a deep commitment to democratic and egalitarian principles, as well as a strong sense of independence, individualism, and generosity. It is an amalgamation of traditions developed independently, drawing on heritage from distant ancestors in Nubia and pre-dynastic Egypt, the ancient civilization of Punt, and the subsequent rise of the proto-Somali city-states known collectively as &#x27;Barbaria&#x27;. Somalia was among the first regions outside the Arabian Peninsula to embrace Islam and became a center of influential Islamic scholarship, exemplified by the medieval traditions of Zaylaʿi and Jabarti scholars. Much of contemporary Somalia’s territory—and adjoining Somali regions in neighboring countries—once formed the Adal Sultanate. The Sultanates of Adal and Mogadishu were vibrant hubs of trade, knowledge and culture whose globetrotting merchants and longstanding diasporic communities exchanged goods and ideas across the Indian Ocean. This cosmopolitan legacy is reflected in Somalia’s rich oral heritage, expressed through poetry, song, and proverbs celebrated for their wit and eloquence. Moreover, a keen sense of humor and wit, combined with physical courage and mental acuity, is demonstrated in traditional games such as “googaleysi,” which both entertain and impart practical knowledge. Today, Somalia and its global diaspora continue to contribute to business, fashion, music, trade, and science and technology.

The hypernym of the term &quot;Somali&quot; from a geopolitical sense is &quot;Horner&quot; and from an ethnic sense, it is &quot;Cushite&quot;.

==Overview==

The cultural diffusion of Somali commercial enterprise can be detected in its exotic cuisine, which contains Southeast Asian influences. Due to the Somali people&#x27;s foremost ingenuity and facility with poetry, Somalia has often been referred to as a &quot;Nation of Poets&quot; and a &quot;Nation of Bards&quot;, as, for example, by the Canadian novelist Margaret Laurence. Somalis have a story-telling tradition.

According to Canadian novelist and scholar Margaret Laurence, who originally coined the term &quot;Nation of Poets&quot; to describe the Somali Peninsular, the Eidagale clan were viewed as &quot;the recognized experts in the composition of poetry&quot; by their fellow Somali contemporaries:

Among the tribes, the Eidagalla are the recognized experts in the composition of poetry. One individual poet of the Eidagalla may be no better than a good poet of another tribe, but the Eidagalla appear to have more poets than any other tribe. &quot;if you had a hundred Eidagalla men here,&quot; Hersi Jama once told me, &quot;And asked which of them could sing his own gabei ninety-five would be able to sing. The others would still be learning.&quot;

Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore. Most Somali songs are pentatonic; that is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale.

Somali art is the artistic culture of the Somali people, both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in pottery, music, architecture, wood carving and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its aniconism, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic mythology of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous Muslim beliefs. The country&#x27;s shape gives a united country the nickname &quot;toddobo&quot; (seven).

Somali nationalism (Somali: &quot;Soomaalinimo&quot;) is centered on the notion that the Somali people share a common language, religion, culture and ethnicity, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. The ideology&#x27;s earliest manifestations in the medieval era are traced to the Adalites whilst in the contemporary era its often traced back to SYL or in present-day Somaliland, the first Somali nationalist political organization to be formed was the Somali National League (SNL), established in 1935 in the former British Somaliland protectorate. In the country&#x27;s northeastern, central and southern regions, the similarly oriented Somali Youth Club (SYC) was founded in 1943 in Italian Somaliland, just prior to the trusteeship period. The SYC was later renamed the Somali Youth League (SYL) in 1947. It became the most influential political party in the early years of post-independence Somalia.

==Religion==
With very few exceptions, Somalis are entirely Muslims, the majority belonging to the Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi‘i school of Islamic jurisprudence. There are two theories about when Somalis began adopting Islam. One states that the religion entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had, at Prophet Muhummad&#x27;s urging, sought refuge across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa. Islam may thus have been introduced into Somalia well before the faith even took root in its place of origin. An alternate theory states that Islam was brought to the coastal settlements of Somalia between the 7th and the 10th century by seafaring Arab and Persian merchants. Somali Sufi religious orders (&quot;tariqa&quot;) – the Qadiriyya, the Ahmadiya and the Salihiyya – in the form of Muslim brotherhoods have played a major role in Somali Islam and the modern era history of Somalia.

Of the three orders, the less strict Qaadiriya &quot;tariqa&quot; is the oldest, and it is the sect to which most Somalis belong. The Qaadiriya order is named after Shaikh Muhiuddin Abdul Qadir Gilani of Baghdad. I. M. Lewis states that Qaadiriya has a high reputation for maintaining a higher standard of Islamic instruction than its rivals.

Ahmadiyah and its sub-sect Salihiyyah preached a puritanical form of Islam, and have rejected the popular Sufi practice of &quot;tawassul&quot; (visiting the tombs of saints to ask mediation). B. G. Martin states that these two orders shared some of the views of the Wahhabis of Arabia. The religious differences between Qaadiriya and Salihiyya were controversial, as Salihis continued to oppose the Qadiris&#x27; practice of &quot;tawassul&quot;, and claimed the act to be invalid and improper religious activity. The Ahmadiya has the smallest number of adherents of the three orders.

Qur&#x27;anic schools (also known as &quot;dugsi&quot;) remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. It is delivered in Arabic. They provide Islamic education for children. According to the UNICEF, the &quot;dugsi&quot; system where the content is based on Quran, teaches the greatest number of students and enjoys high parental support, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas. A study from 1993 found, among other things, that &quot;unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around 40 per cent of Qur&#x27;anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children.&quot; To address these concerns, the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur&#x27;anic education is now regulated.

The Somali community has produced important Muslim figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Islamic learning and practice in the Horn of Africa and the Muslim world.
Although Pew Research Center has not conducted a survey in Somalia, its Somali-majority northwestern neighbour Djibouti reported a creed breakdown of Muslims which was reported as 77% adhering to Sunnism, 8% as non-denominational Muslim, 2% as Shia, thirteen percent refusing to answer, and a further report inclusive of Somali Region stipulating 2% adherence to a minority sect (e.g. Ibadism, Quranism etc.). Somali Sunnis primarily belong to Shafi`i school of Islamic jurisprudence, or are adherents to the Salafi creed. Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, is also well-established, with many local &quot;jama&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;zawiya&quot;) or congregations of the various &quot;tariiqa&quot; or Sufi orders. The constitution of Somalia likewise defines Islam as the religion of the Somali Republic, and Islamic Sharia as the basic source for national legislation.

Although Somali women were initially excluded from the many male-dominated religious orders, the all-female institution Abay Siti was formed in the late 19th century, incorporating Somali tradition and Islam.

In addition, the Somali community has produced numerous important Islamic figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and well beyond. Among these Islamic scholars is the 14th century Somali theologian and jurist Uthman bin Ali Zayla&#x27;i of Zeila, who wrote the single most authoritative text on the Hanafi school of Islam, consisting of four volumes known as the &quot;Tabayin al-Haqa’iq li Sharh Kanz al-Daqa’iq&quot;.

==Languages==

The Somali language is the official language of Somalia. It is a member of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and its nearest relatives are the Afar and saho languages. Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages, with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.

Somali dialects are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benaadir and Maay. Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benaadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the Benadir coast from Adale to south of Merca, including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional phonemes which do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle (Rahanweyn) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.

Since Somali had long lost its ancient script, a number of writing systems have been used over the years for transcribing the language. Of these, the Somali alphabet is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre formally introduced it in October 1972.

The script was developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for transcribing the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except &quot;p&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. Besides Ahmed&#x27;s Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established Arabic script and Wadaad&#x27;s writing. Indigenous writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare scripts, which were invented by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur and Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare, respectively.

In addition to Somali, Arabic is an official national language of Somalia. Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the Arab World, the far-reaching influence of the Arabic media, and religious education.

English is also widely used and taught. Italian used to be a major language, but its influence significantly diminished following independence. It is now most frequently heard among older generations who were in contact with the Italians at that time or later as migrants into Italy. Other minority languages include Bravanese, a variant of the Bantu Swahili language that is spoken along the coast by the Bravanese people.

==Somali clans==
Somali clans are patrilineal kinship groups based on agnatic descent of the Somali people. Tradition and folklore connects the origin of the Somali population by language and way of life, and societal organisations, by customs, and by a feeling of belonging to a broader family among individuals from the Arabian Peninsula. The Somali people are mainly divided among five patrilineal clans, the Hawiye, Darod, Rahanweyn, Dir, and Isaaq. The average person is able to trace his/her ancestry generations back. Somali clans in contemporary times have an established official structure in the country&#x27;s political system, acknowledged by a mathematical formula for equitably distributing seats between the clans in the Federal Parliament of Somalia. The Somali concept of ‘Abtirsi’ refers to a systematically organized lineage-based registry or list of paternal ancestors among Somalis. This lineage starts with the individual’s father and extends to include the grandfather, great-grandfather, and so forth, ultimately culminating at the patriarch of the broader clan-family from which the individual is descended.

==Attire==

===Men===

When not dressed in Westernized clothing such as jeans and t-shirts, Somali men traditionally wear the &quot;macawis&quot; (ma&#x27;awiis), which is a sarong-like garment worn around the waist and a large cloth wrapped around the upper part of their body. On their heads, they often wrap a colorful turban or wear the &quot;koofiyad&quot;, an embroidered taqiyah.

Due to Somalia&#x27;s proximity to and close ties with the Muslim world, many Somali men also wear the Thawb (&quot;khamiis&quot; in Somali), a long white garment common among Muslims.

Traditionally Somali attire for men consisted of two sheets (often plain white), one draped over the shoulder and the other tied around the waist. The sheet sometimes had embroidery, patterns or laced borders. This attire is no longer common though it can be found in some rural communities.

===Women===

During regular, day-to-day activities, women usually wear the &quot;guntiino&quot;, a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. The guntiino is traditionally made out of plain white fabric sometimes featuring with decorative borders, although nowadays alindi, a textile common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa, is more frequently used. The garment can be worn in many different styles and with different fabrics.

For more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac, a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester fabric. It is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as the gorgorad, the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads. The fabric is typically acquired from Somali clothing stores in tandem with the &quot;gorgorad&quot;. In more informal settings, like being at home, Somali women typically wear baati. A baati is a long dress-like wear that is made out of comfortable polyester.

Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as &quot;shash&quot;, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as &quot;garbasaar&quot;. A garbasaar can be worn by any woman regardless of their marital status. In general, however, Somali women cover up with hijab when outside their home or in the presence of men outside of the immediate family (cousins, uncles, friends).

Additionally, Somali women have a long tradition of wearing gold and silver jewelry, particularly bangles. During weddings, the bride is frequently adorned in gold. Many Somali women by tradition also wear gold necklaces and anklets. The &quot;xirsi&quot;, an Islamic necklace likewise donned in Ethiopia and Yemen, is frequently worn.

==Art==

Somali art is the artistic culture of the Somali people, both historic and contemporary. These include artistic traditions in pottery, music, architecture, wood carving and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its aniconism, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic mythology of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous Muslim beliefs. However, there have been instances in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the golden birds on the Mogadishan canopies, the camels and horses on the ancient rock paintings in northern Somalia, and the plant decorations on religious tombs in southern Somalia, but these are considered rare. Instead, intricate patterns and geometric designs, bold colors and monumental architecture were the norm.

Additionally, henna is an important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during weddings, Eid, Ramadan, and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to other horn of Africans, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna, and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding ceremony takes place.

==Customs and courtesies==

Somalis warmly greet each other with handshakes, but shaking hands with the opposite sex is avoided by many. Common verbal greetings include:

Common Verbal Phrases include;
* &quot;Assalamu aleikum&quot; (Peace be upon you)
* &quot;Maalin wanaagsan&quot; ()
* &quot;Galab wanaagsan&quot; ()
* &quot;Habeen wanaagsan&quot; ()
* &quot;Iska warran&quot; and &quot;Ii waran&quot; (How are you?)
* &quot;Nabad&quot; (I&#x27;m fine or literally translated meaning ( &quot;peace&quot;)

Somalis use sweeping hand and arm gestures to dramatize speech. Many ideas are expressed through specific hand gestures. Most of these gestures are performed by women:

* A swift twist of the open hand means &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
* Snapping fingers may mean &quot;long ago&quot; or and &quot;so on&quot;
* A thumb under the chin indicates &quot;fullness&quot;.
* It is impolite to point the sole of one&#x27;s foot or shoe at another person.
* It is impolite to use the index finger to call somebody; that gesture is used for calling dogs.

During the Siad Barre era, a new greeting intended to combat the prevalence of clannism was introduced called &quot;jaale&quot;, which in Somali has dual meanings, including the color yellow and &quot;comrade&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;.

==Media==
==Literature==
Somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of Islamic literature ranging from poetry to Hadith. With the adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1972 to transcribe the Somali language, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim. Of these modern writers, Nuruddin Farah is probably the most celebrated. Books such as &quot;From a Crooked Rib&quot; and &quot;Links&quot; are considered important literary achievements, works which have earned Farah, among other accolades, the 1998 Neustadt International Prize for Literature. Farah Mohamed Jama Awl is another prominent Somali writer who is perhaps best known for his Dervish era novel, &quot;Ignorance is the enemy of love&quot;. Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame is considered by many to be the greatest living Somali poet, and several of his works have been translated internationally.

==Sport==

Football, or soccer, is the most popular sport in Somalia. Important domestic competitions are the Somalia League and Somalia Cup, with the Somalia national football team playing internationally.

Basketball is also played in the country. The FIBA Africa Championship 1981 was hosted in Mogadishu from December 15 to December 23, 1981, during which the national basketball team received the bronze medal.

Abdi Bile was the first athlete from Somalia to win a gold medal at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics when he became 1500 metre champion at the 1987 World Championships. Mo Farah has also won three World Championship golds and two Olympic golds at the 2012 London Olympics in the 5000 and 10,000 metres.

In the martial arts, Faisal Jeylani Aweys and Mohamed Deq Abdulle took home a silver medal and fourth place, respectively, at the 2013 Open World Taekwondo Challenge Cup in Tongeren. The Somali National Olympic committee has devised a special support program to ensure continued success in future tournaments. Additionally, Mohamed Jama has won both world and European titles in K1 and Thai Boxing.

<text>East Linton is a village and former police burgh in East Lothian, Scotland, situated on the River Tyne and A199 road (former A1 road) five miles east of Haddington, with an estimated population of in .
During the 19th century the population increased from 715 inhabitants in 1831 to 1,042 by 1881. The 1961 census showed the village had a population of 1,579. The number dropped significantly at the end of the 20th century, but has subsequently risen again.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
Archaeological excavations in advance of a residential development by CFA Archaeology uncovered a Bronze Age barrow cemetery consisting of three ring-ditches. Cremation burials were recovered from all the ring-ditches, radiocarbon dated to between 1400-1000 BC. A large pit close to one of the ring-ditches, was likely used to dispose of the residue ash from funeral pyres, was also excavated. They also found a ditch dated to the medieval period.

==History==

Originally called &quot;Linton&quot;, the village probably gets its name from the Linn (a waterfall) on the river which it grew alongside. It was later renamed &quot;East Linton&quot; to distinguish it from West Linton in Peebleshire when the railways were built.

Significant to the development of the village was the East Linton Bridge crossing the River Tyne, carrying the Edinburgh to Berwick-upon-Tweed post road (Great North Road).

In September 1549 French troops destroyed the bridge to delay the retreat of the English army.
The current bridge was built no later than 1560 at the same location.

Today, only one church remains active, Prestonkirk Parish Church which is also an old name of the parish. The village is now, along with Stenton and Whittingehame; part of the parish of Traprain. The original church was founded by Baldred of Tyninghame, also known as &#x27;St Baldred of the Bass&#x27;, in the sixth century. The current church tower dates from 1631, while the main building is from 1770. It was enlarged in 1824 and the interior was redesigned in 1892. The St Baldred window was established in 1959. There is also a Free Church of Scotland (St Andrew&#x27;s) built in 1843, which had its own school, a Roman Catholic church (St Kentigern ) and a Methodist hall. Presbyterian Dissenters also used to worship in East Linton.
The clock on St Andrew&#x27;s former church was put in by the village to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee; it was named &quot;Jessie&quot; after a local girl when some village lads climbed into the steeple and poured a libation over the clock to christen it. The name has remained ever since. There has long been a school in the village, and the mid-Victorian schoolmaster in East Linton was a George Pringle Smith (d.1850).

The fountain, which stands in The Square on the site of an old well, takes the form of a large cast iron basin with scalloped edges which stands on an ashlar pedestal and, in turn, supports a three-armed lamp standard.
At the base of this there are four young child figures beneath a scalloped canopy, each holding a vase out of which water flows.
A plaque attached to the N side of the pedestal records that the fountain was &#x27;Presented to the Burgh of East Linton by John Drysdale Esq., Buenos Ayres. -1882-&#x27; Around the bottom edge of the plaque is the legend &#x27;John Storie Esq., Chief Magistrate.&#x27; John Drysdale, was a former East Linton native who settled in Buenos Aires, to become a farmer/rancher/businessman.
Preston Mill, an old watermill, is on the outskirts. There has been a mill on the site since 1599, and it is still working. Attached to the watermill is a kiln, with a cowl of local design. The property is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland. The mill was the location setting for a number of scenes during the Jacobite Uprising in Season 1 of the &quot;&#x27;Outlander&quot;&#x27; TV series.

Prestonkirk House dominates the entrance to Stories Park. Built in 1865 as the county&#x27;s Combination Poorhouse, it served 15 parishes and housed 88 people. It now serves as housing and for the library and Day Centre. Stories Park takes its name from the Storie family of veterinary surgeons, who lived in The Square and kept racehorses in their &#x27;park&#x27;. Francis Storie (d.1875) was East Linton&#x27;s chief magistrate 1866–72.

The Peerie Well, beside the River Tyne, supplied the village with water from 1881.

Prior to the coming of the North British Railway, the mail coaches changed horses at the Douglas Inn, opposite the distillery in East Linton. A fine Victorian station on the East Coast Main Line opened in 1846. Following the closure of the branch railway line to Haddington in 1949, East Linton became the next closest for that burgh until it too closed in 1964 as part of Dr Richard Beeching&#x27;s &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot;. The original station building is now used as a residence.

A surviving relic of East Linton&#x27;s past importance as an agricultural centre is a timber octagonal auction mart for cattle, pigs and sheep in Station Road. Dating back to 1850, the mart has recently been fully restored and is now used for various community functions and a Sunday market. The location was used as the setting to re-introduce Stephen Bonnet in a darkly memorable fashion during Season 5 of the &quot;&#x27;Outlander&quot;&#x27; TV series.

Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below . and is milder than places such as Moscow and Labrador which lie at similar latitudes. Summer temperatures are normally moderate, rarely exceeding .
The prevailing wind direction is from the south west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than locations in the west of Scotland. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar, a persistent coastal fog.

<text>Janes is a global open-source intelligence company specialising in military, national security, aerospace and transport topics, whose name derives from British author Fred T. Jane.

==History==
Jane&#x27;s Information Group was founded in 1898 by Fred T. Jane, who had begun sketching ships as an enthusiast naval artist while living in Portsmouth. This gradually developed into an encyclopedic knowledge, culminating in the publishing of &quot;All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; (1898). The company then gradually branched out into other areas of military expertise. The books and trade magazines published by the company are often considered the &quot;de facto&quot; public source of information on warfare and transportation systems.

Based in Greater London for most of its existence, the group was owned by the Thomson Corporation, the Woodbridge Company, then IHS Markit, before being acquired by Montagu Private Equity in 2019.

In March 2022, Janes acquired Washington, D.C.-based RWR Advisory Group.

==Description==
The company name is officially Jane&#x27;s Information Group, and it is located in Croydon. The company continues to provide open-source intelligence in the defence, security, aerospace and transport sectors.

==Publications==
Of their publications, books (published annually) include &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Military Communications&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s World Air Forces&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s World Navies&quot;, and &quot;Jane&#x27;s World Railways&quot;. Periodicals include &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot;, &quot;Jane&#x27;s International Defence Review&quot;, and &quot;Jane&#x27;s Navy International&quot;. &quot;Jane&#x27;s Police Review&quot; (2011) and &quot;Jane&#x27;s Airport Review&quot; (2019) were discontinued.

Jane&#x27;s &quot;All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; and &quot;Fighting Ships&quot; are included in the 2019 edition of the AP stylebook as references for proper notation of aircraft and military ship names.

&quot;Jane&#x27;s Combat Simulations&quot; was a brand of computer flight simulation games and naval warfare simulations produced between 1996 and 2000 under license to Electronic Arts.

<text>Flax Bourton is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England. The parish, with a population of 715, is situated within the unitary authority of North Somerset, on the edge of Nailsea Moor on the A370 road south west of Bristol city centre.

The village has a primary school, one pub named &quot;The Jubilee Inn&quot;, a church dating back to Norman times and is the home of Backwell Flax Bourton Cricket Club.

==History==

Backwell Hillfort between Flax Bourton and Backwell is an Iron Age hill fort.

To the north of the village and close to the Bristol to Exeter railway line a mill was built on the Land Yeo. It may have existed at the time of the Domesday Book and strong documentary evidence exists from 1769. Between 1839 and 1885 the river was diverted into the tailrace of the mill, eliminating a bend in the river. All that remains of the three storey mill is a single storey garage of a private house.

Farleigh Hospital and the Church of St. George was built in 1837 as a Workhouse for the Bedminster Union. Also on Old Weston Road is the former Long Ashton Magistrate&#x27;s Court and Police Station, which was built 1857-58 by John Norton,
and is now home to the Coroner&#x27;s court for Bristol and North Somerset.

An MoD fuel depot, part of the Government Pipelines and Storage System with its own railway sidings, is just off the main line behind the former station. Its future is currently under review.
It was constructed between 1954 and 57 by Esso as part of the North Somerset Complex of sites and pipelines for the storage of white oil products. It was originally connected by five pipelines but only one was operational by 1990. It was originally designed for distribution by road and rail with two rail gantries and three road gantries. The site was emptied and closed in the early 1990s following the end of the Cold War.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one member of parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Geography==

Stancombe Quarry was first built in 1952. Today, the quarry which is operated by Tarmac, produces Carboniferous Limestone, which is mainly for use on the roads, after crushing on site. The site has an expected output of 28 million tonnes over a 25-year period.

Along with the rest of South West England, Flax Bourton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.

==Transport==

In 1860 Flax Bourton railway station was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway just west of the short tunnel at the summit of the climb from Bristol. It closed to passengers on 2 December 1963. Sustrans have recently built a cycle path leading to Backwell and Nailsea, adjacent to the railway line. Today the nearest station is Nailsea and Backwell. There are also regular bus links available from Farleigh Green (&quot;to Weston-super-Mare&quot;), and top of station road (&quot;to Bristol&quot;)

==Religious sites==

The Anglican parish church of St. Michael and All Angels has 12th-century origins and has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

<doc id="1092031" wikidata="Q4879717" url="?curid=1092031" title="Beecroft Art Gallery">
<text>Beecroft Art Gallery is an art gallery in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England. The gallery is housed in the former municipal central library that opened in 1974 in the brutalist style as part of Southend Civic Centre.
The Beecroft Art Gallery has a busy programme of changing exhibitions of art, photography and fashion. On the ground floor, the gallery presents temporary exhibitions of modern and contemporary artists, focusing on the work of emerging and established local artists. On the first floor, visitors can see works from the permanent collection and exciting fashion exhibitions. In the basement of the building is the charity The Jazz Centre UK.

==History==
Prior to 2014, the gallery was located in an Edwardian building on Station Road at Westcliff-on-Sea, opposite the Cliffs Pavilion, and which was donated to the people of Southend-on-Sea in 1952 by Walter Beecroft (1885–1961) to house his eclectic collection of art works. Beecroft was a solicitor in nearby Leigh. He had already set up an Art Gallery Sub-Committee of the Public Libraries &amp; Museum Committee in 1928, and in 1947 he proposed to endow a building to become an Art Gallery. Eventually, this led to the Beecroft Art Gallery on Station Road. Beecroft also endowed the Beecroft Bequest, an art purchase fund administered by the Museums Association. The gallery was resited in 2014 to the former home of the Central Library on Victoria Avenue, Southend-on-Sea, when the library moved to The Forum Southend-on-Sea. The move was completed as a temporary measure, as the original building was subsiding, and the council wanted the former library building to stay open. The plan was ultimately to move the gallery to a new museum located on the Cliffs. The Cliffs museum plan was finally dropped in 2018.

==The building==
The building was designed as a library by the councils architect, Patrick Burrough, as part of the new Southend Civic Centre. The Civic Centre would encompass a new police station, the courthouse, council offices and chamber, a new College and a Library on a site first purchased by the council in 1919 for a further education college, but had been reallocated as a town hall site in 1934. The planned fire station for the site was dropped and it built in Sutton Road. The Central Library opened in 1974, moving from the former free library located next door which had been opened in 1905.
===Fritz Steller wall===
The most famous feature of the gallery&#x27;s building is a tiled wall created by German artist, sculpture and designer Fritz Steller. Steller&#x27;s Transform Ceramic Company, was commissioned by Patrick Burridge, the councils architect, to create a sculptural wall around 1973, prior to the building opening as Southend Central Library. The artist created a series of architectural ceramic tiles with an abstract design referencing the stacking of book spines on library shelves. The brown tiles were cast on sand to give them a unique and unrepeatable surface.
Transform Ceramic also created the brick paving and the raised flower beds around the gallery.

Beecroft Art Gallery has a permanent collection of over 2,000 works, ranging from 17th-century Dutch paintings to contemporary works. The collection includes examples by artists such as Molenaer, Ruisdael and Berchem plus 19th-century artists including Rossetti, Constable and Edward Lear. There are works by Carel Weight, the Great Bardfield Group, and a bronze by Jacob Epstein. The local artist Alan Sorrell is represented by his &quot;Drawings of Nubia&quot; series depicting a visit to Egypt prior to the building of the Aswan Dam. The Thorpe Smith Collection of local landscape views contains paintings, drawings and prints from as early as 1803.

=== Photography ===
The gallery&#x27;s photography collection consists mainly of two large collections of 1972 photographs taken in Southend by Ron McCormick and Josef Koudelka.
In 1972, as part of a major project involving eight towns, The Arts Council commissioned the two photographers to work in the city with the aim of revealing to the people of Southend how they and their environment are seen by two outside observers. Both photographers found inspiration in the street and beach life that day trippers brought to Southend in the summer.
The resulting images were later displayed in the old Beecroft Art Gallery building between 24 March and 22 April 1973 and later toured local schools and community centres. The photographs were then returned to the Beecroft Art Gallery and entered into the collection.

=== Fashion and textiles ===
Southend Museums Service has been acquiring historical and contemporary fashion as part of its social history collection since opening in the 1970s. The collections have subsequently been re-housed at the Beecroft Art Gallery and fashion exhibitions take place there once a year.

The collections&#x27; main strengths are the decades from the 1920s to the 1970s but there are important earlier and later pieces, most notably a rare, 17th century slap sole shoe. The collection includes garments, uniforms, shoes, hats, underwear, jewellery and various accessories. Notable collections are the Gloria Levin collection of Hardy Amies couture and a collection of 1970s stage costumes and accessories worn by Dame Vera Lynn.

Beach wear is a major area of collection and the museums service&#x27;s swimwear collection is believed to be the largest in the country. The collection dates from around 1900 to present times and include several rare pieces. In 2009 Southend Museums received a large donation of 500 bathing suits from private collector, Mavis Plume. It is the largest collection of swimwear in the United Kingdom.

==The Essex Open==
Beecroft Art Gallery is the home of the historic Essex Open Exhibition, which runs annually. Established by the gallery&#x27;s founder in 1957 and inspired by the world-renowned Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, over the years, the exhibition has evolved into a cornerstone of the local cultural scene, drawing participants from across Essex and the historic Essex boundaries of East London (today the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Newham, Redbridge and Waltham Forest).

==The Jazz Centre UK==
The Jazz Centre UK is an independent charity hosted within the building. It was founded from overstock of the National Jazz Archive by trumpeter Digby Fairweather in 2016 to celebrates the music’s heritage, art and memorabilia. The centre is a registered charity, with patrons such as Jamie Cullum, Zoe Rahman and Chris Philips. The centre also promotes contemporary performance and education. Amongst the collections is Louis Armstrong&#x27;s ‘Special’ trumpet, Sir John Dankworth’s first piano and Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s complete archive. The centre was given notice by Southend Council in 2022 that their lease would not be renewed, however in 2024 a new lease was secured. In December 2024, it was announced that Yolanda Charles had joined the board of the charity.

<doc id="1092036" wikidata="Q5513880" url="?curid=1092036" title="General Motors N platform">
<text>The [[General Motors]] N platform (commonly called the N-body or N car) was a front-wheel drive compact automotive platform produced from 1984 to 2005. The GM N platform was based on the GM J-Body and replaced the GM X platform.

==First generation==
The N body was introduced in late 1984 for the 1985 model year. Initially, offered as the Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Calais and Buick Somerset coupes, GM positioned them as premium models at an affordable price. Standard in all models was the 2.5 liter &quot;Iron Duke&quot; 4 cylinder engine developed by the Pontiac Motor Division. Optional was the Buick built 3.0 liter V6 with multi-port fuel injection. All models could have a 5 speed manual or 3 speed automatic. During the 1986 model year, four door models were added to all three brand entries. 
The N platform was very similar to the GM L platform; however, the first generation N cars were engineered by Oldsmobile while the L cars were engineered by Chevrolet. The first generation used a twist-beam rear suspension and MacPherson struts in front, and featured a wheelbase. 

The N platform was used for the following vehicles:

* 1985–1991 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1985–1991 Oldsmobile Calais
* 1985–1987 Buick Somerset
* 1986–1991 Buick Skylark

==Second generation==
For the 1992 model year, General Motors heavily modified all of their N-Body offerings. The Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais was dropped in favor of the new Achieva, while the Buick Skylark and Pontiac Grand Am nameplates continued. In addition to new styling, this generation was longer and carried more distinctive sheet metal for each brand. The second generation N-Body continued until 1998 when it was replaced by the third and final generation. 
* 1992–1998 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1992–1998 Oldsmobile Achieva
* 1992–1998 Buick Skylark

==Third generation (GMX130)==
In 1997 and 1998 General Motors consolidated the 2nd generation N platform with the GM A platform (FWD) and GM L platform during the corporately engineered P-90 project which became known as GMX130. This automotive platform featured fully independent suspension and a wheelbase of . This was the last vehicle with significant engineering involvement of Oldsmobile and also the last one produced at the Lansing Car Assembly plant on April 29, 2004. A mid-size version spawned the 1997-2003 Chevrolet Malibu &amp; Oldsmobile Cutlass of 1997–99, including the 2004–05 Chevrolet Classic.

The GMX130 platform underpinned the following vehicles:
* 1999–2004 Oldsmobile Alero
* 1999–2005 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1997–1999 Oldsmobile Cutlass
* 1997–2003 Chevrolet Malibu
* 2004–2005 Chevrolet Classic (a previous-generation Malibu sold to fleet buyers)

The GMX130 was replaced by the Epsilon platform for 2006.

<doc id="1092039" wikidata="Q608356" url="?curid=1092039" title="Fivemiletown">
<text>Fivemiletown is a village and townland in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It is 16 miles (26 km) east of Enniskillen and 26 miles (43 km) west-south-west of Dungannon, on the A4 Enniskillen-to-Dungannon road.

Fivemiletown&#x27;s population was 1,243 at the 2011 census. The village is most famous for its creamery, which was begun as a cooperative in 1898 by Hugh de Fellonburg Montgomery. Fivemiletown Creamery originally made butter and milk, but now makes cheeses for the British and Irish market, and for export across Europe and North America.

==Name==
Fivemiletown&#x27;s name comes from its location five Irish miles (1 Irish mile = 1.27 statute miles = 2044 m) from its nearest neighbours: Clogher, Brookeborough and Tempo. The original Irish name of the townland of Fivemiletown was &quot;Baile na Lorgan&quot; – &#x27;townland of the long ridge&#x27; – anglicised as Ballynalurgan. Previous names for the town of Fivemiletown were Mount Stewart, from Sir William Stewart who founded it in 1619 and Blessingbourn from the name of the nearby residence of Colonel Montgomery, the proprietor of the area in the early 19th century.

==History==
The Clogher Valley Railway ran from Tynan, County Armagh, to Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, with Fivemiletown being one of its main stations. The old station house is still one of the landmarks in the village. The trains stopped at the Buttermarket on Main Street and the creamery to be loaded or unloaded with goods.

After the Second World War, the growth of road transport made railways almost redundant and when the Northern Ireland Government learned that the Clogher Valley Railway had operated as a loss for 27 years because of growing road transport, it recommended the shutting of the line. The last train ran on the last day of 1941, bringing to an end one of Fivemiletown&#x27;s most characteristic features.

===The Troubles===

Incidents in Fivemiletown during the Troubles resulting in two or more deaths:

*12 December 1993 – Andrew Beacom (46) and Ernest Smith (49), both Protestant members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) from the RUC base at Clogher, were ambushed and shot dead by members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army&#x27;s East Tyrone Brigade while on patrol in their civilian-type car along Main Street after midnight. A British Army Lynx helicopter received automatic fire while chasing the perpetrators.

==Geography==

Halfway between Fivemiletown and Fintona northwest, lies Murley Mountain. This mountain rises to a peak of above sea level and marks the western edge of the Clogher Valley.

On the summit is the Lendrums Bridge wind farm, one of the biggest in Northern Ireland, with 20 wind turbines. Another ten are planned for the neighbouring Hunter&#x27;s Hill. Murley Mountain&#x27;s location is lonely and exposed, especially to prevailing southwesterly winds. This makes it a prime site for wind-generated power.

The River Blackwater runs through counties Tyrone and Armagh, as well as County Monaghan. The source of the Blackwater is to the north of Fivemiletown. There are also several small lakes around the village which draw many anglers.

==Transport==
*The narrow gauge Clogher Valley Railway ran through the village from 1887 until 1942. The train originally had a top speed of . Fivemiletown railway station opened on 2 May 1887 and was shut on 1 January 1942.
*The A4 is the main route into Fermanagh (and on to County Sligo) from the Belfast direction. Running from the end of the M1 at Dungannon, the section through the Clogher Valley is the lowest standard on the whole route. While towns and villages along the A4 in Fermanagh were generally bypassed years ago, the A4 runs straight through the middle of three Tyrone villages: Augher, Clogher and Fivemiletown. These are now the only non-bypassed settlements on the road. The largest of these, Fivemiletown, will be bypassed. The village currently has a one-way system to cope with the heavy traffic on the narrow main street, but this stalls long-distance traffic and is a big inconvenience to residents of the village. The new road will be built to 2+1 standard, meaning that there will be one lane in one direction, with two in the opposite direction to permit overtaking. On longer routes, such as this one, the overtaking lane usually alternates giving an overtaking opportunity to traffic in each direction. The scheme will complement a 2+1 scheme completed on the A4 outside Fivemiletown in 2004.

On Census Day (27 March 2011) the usually resident population of Fivemiletown Settlement was 1,243, accounting for 0.07% of the NI total. Of these:
*19.23% were aged under 16 and 18.25% were aged 65 and over
*48.75% of the population were male and 51.25% were female
*23.17% were from a Catholic background and 72.0% were from a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; background

<text>Jazz at Lincoln Center is an organization based in New York City. Part of Lincoln Center, the organization was founded in 1987 and opened at Time Warner Center (now Deutsche Bank Center) in October 2004. The organization seeks to “represent the totality of jazz music – educationally, curatorially, archivally, and ceremonially.” They advocate for jazz, culture, and arts education globally. Wynton Marsalis is the artistic director and the leader of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.

The center hosts performances by the orchestra and by visiting musicians. It is home to the New York City Opera. Many concerts are streamed live on the center&#x27;s YouTube channel. The center also presents educational programs in its home buildings, online, and in schools throughout the country.

The organization reaches approximately 3 million people of all ages every year through concerts (where more than 90 percent of seats for major shows are sold), tours, musical instruction programs, sheet music, recordings on their label (Blue Engine), and live performances on their platform JAZZ LIVE. 

The center has large speakers throughout the building that constantly play the music of great jazz artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, etc.

==History==

During the mid-1980s, the Lincoln Center sought to attract new and younger audiences. The space wasn’t used during the summer and the organization wanted to find ways to fill the halls while resident companies performed elsewhere. Jazz enthusiasts on the Lincoln Center campus fought for jazz to be recognized by the organization. In a 1986 report the organization said, “Lincoln Center should focus on excellence in its course offering and that no compelling case can be made for adding a constituent in an area like jazz.” This was after the third proposal from then director of visitor services, Alina Bloomgarden, to introduce a permanent jazz program to the Lincoln Center. It was believed that jazz audiences would be too rowdy. Bloomgarden then decided to invite Wynton Marsalis to help her plan a summer concert series. In order to succeed, this concert series had to show commercial viability and merits of both the music and community it came from. 

In 1987, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis was involved in starting the Classical Jazz concert series, the first series of jazz concerts at Lincoln Center. The concert series began in August 1987 and they celebrated women in jazz. This included Betty Carter, Sasha Dalton, Marian McPartland, and others. Given the high stakes, success of this concert series was pertinent. At this point in time, many great jazz innovators had passed away, jazz clubs were shutting down, not many colleges and universities had jazz programs, and there was a rise in commercial aspirations with electronic music. It was also a polarizing time in the United States with many places still being racially integrated, the AIDS epidemic, boost in militarization and globalization with the Cold War, and Ronald Regan’s War on Drugs increasing mass incarceration. By their second year, they had their own radio services on the National Public Radio and began touring. 

A sense of what Marsalis was saving was recorded in this three part suite, &quot;The New Orleans Function,&quot; that was styled after New Orleans funeral marches. Stanley Crouch (involved in finding Jazz at Lincoln Center) wrote an impassioned oration that was delivered by Reverend Jeremy Wright. This sermon is read as a statement of purpose for what Jazz at Lincoln Center would become: 

“It is possible that we who listened heard something timeless from those who are the descendants of the many who were literally up for sale—those whose presence on the auction blocks and in the slave quarters formed the cross upon which the Constitution of this nation was crucified. Yet—even after that crucifixion, there were those who rose in the third century of American slavery with a vision of freedom.”
&quot;There were those who lit the mighty wick that extended from the candle—and carried it. There were those who spoke through music of the meaning of light—those who were not content to accept the darkness in the heart that comes when you surrender to dragons who think themselves grand. There were those who said, “Listen closely, now”—those who said, “If you give me a fair chance, I will help you better understand the meaning of democracy.” Yes—that is precisely what they said. “If you give me a fair chance, I will help you better understand the meaning of democracy.” These are they who were truly the makers of a noble sound.”Gordon Davis, member of the Lincoln Center Board and founding chair, saw the success of the summer concert series and advocated for a permanent jazz program. The board agreed and by 1996, Jazz at Lincoln Center was elevated to full constituency along with the City Ballet, Metropolitan Opera, and houses dedicated to European Arts.

In 1996, the Jazz at Lincoln Center organization became a constituent of Lincoln Center next to organizations such as the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera. The budget for Jazz at Lincoln Center was $4 million in 1996, compared to $150 million for the Metropolitan Opera. In 2016, its budget was over $50 million. Wynton Marsalis has been artistic director since 1987. Greg Scholl became executive director in 2012.

Marsalis leads the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which performs in the Appel Room and the Rose Theater in addition to extensive international tours. Concerts are also broadcast live online. Educational programs are broadcast on the center&#x27;s YouTube channel. Since 2015, the orchestra&#x27;s albums have been issued on its own label, Blue Engine Records.

The center distributes jazz curriculums to high schools through its Essentially Ellington program. Professional musicians visit schools through the Let Freedom Swing program. The center runs a Middle School Jazz Academy, a High School Jazz Academy, and a Summer Academy, all in New York City, all of them with free tuition. Every year the orchestra tours and visits schools throughout the U.S. The Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival takes place every year at Jazz at Lincoln Center.

==Rose Hall==
The performing arts complex, Frederick P. Rose Hall, was designed by Rafael Viñoly and is located on the fifth floor of Deutsche Bank Center (originally Time Warner Center). The $131 million facility opened in fall 2004 and  was the world’s first performance, education, and broadcast facility all devoted to jazz. It was engineered specifically for the warmth and clarity of jazz. Rose Hall consists of three venues: Rose Theater, The Appel Room, and Dizzy&#x27;s Club, named after trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. The Hall also contains the Irene Diamond Education Center with rehearsal and recording rooms.The location was criticized for being within a high-end shopping mall at Columbus Circle and isolated from the main Lincoln Center that was four blocks away. JALC counteracted this by saying that this house of consumerism “showcases the music born from a  freedom struggle, one that encourages both players and listeners to reach for higher ideals.”

Leaders of Jazz at Lincoln Center undertook construction of a facility that had proper acoustics for swing and blues oriented jazz. They also wanted this facility to properly house the institution’s educational and archival pursuits. To start gaining traction, Marsalis collaborated with popular musicians outside of jazz such as Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, and Bob Dylan. Not only did this bring in a larger audience, it also allowed for performances with rich tension between swing, rock, and R&amp;B. 

Rose Theater has a “floating box-in-box construction” that has no rigid structural connections to Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s other performance halls.2 The venue has 1,233 seats and is adaptable for opera, dance, theater, film, and orchestral performances. In order to minimize outside noise and to remain both quiet and intimate, the space sits on rubber isolation pads. In order to maintain adaptability, Rose Hall has moveable seating towers that can be put into concert mode and theater mode. When in concert mode, seats are behind and around the musicians to serve as an acoustical and visual function. This also allows for more seating at concerts. When in theater mode, the towers are stored in an air caster system. This allows for a platform when opera, ballet, or modern dance require scenic elements. 

The Appel Room contains 583 seats with an informal and intimate setting. The room normally has seven separate seating levels, but it can be converted into four to accommodate for dancing and mobility. The room has a 50 foot high glass wall that overlooks Central Park. This wall is angled slightly upward, allowing for sound to be reflected from the atrium and stage monitors directly into the ceiling. Panels are hung from the ceiling and catwalks to diffuse and absorb sound. 

Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola (named after American jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie) contains 140 seats and was designed as an intimate jazz club for live trios, pianists, and vocalists. The room has a city view of Columbus Circle and Central Park. It was designed to have a “golden” sound to encourage artist-audience interaction (similar to early New York City jazz clubs). 

== Reception ==
Since Jazz at Lincoln Center’s inception, critics have accused Wynton Marsalis of being an elitist who hasn’t embraced diversity and has failed to foster music experimentation. Matthew Shipp (pianist) wrote an article in 1998 criticizing the center. He said that rather than fostering a performance space, the center institutionalized jazz and created an environment where music goes to die. By institutionalizing jazz, Shipp claimed that something illegitimate becomes legitimate, which takes away from the spirit of jazz.

Others claimed that Marsalis would “return artistic seriousness and market viability to a genre that had lost its way… [and] radiated a brashness that all but dared critics to reject the savior mythology.”

<text>The Uganda national football team also known as The Uganda Cranes represents Uganda in international football and is controlled by the Federation of Uganda Football Associations.

==History==
The Uganda Cranes made their debut on 1 May 1926 against Kenya drawing 1–1. In 1962, they qualified for their Africa Cup of Nations debut in the third edition of the tournament, which included only 4 teams. In the semi-finals, the Cranes were defeated and eliminated by United Arab Republic (2–1), and then lost the third place match against Tunisia (3–0).

The Cranes returned to the Africa Cup of Nations in 1974, where they were eliminated in the first round following 2 defeats against Egypt and Zambia and a draw against Ivory Coast. In 1976, they were eliminated in the first round, being defeated by Ethiopia, Egypt and Guinea.

In the 1978 Africa Cup of Nations, the Cranes finished second in the group stages defeating Congo (3–1) and Morocco (3–0) and lost 3–1 to Tunisia. In the semi-finals they eliminated Nigeria (2–1), and in the finals they were defeated by Ghana (2–0).

In 2017 the Cranes qualified for the African Cup of Nations again after 39 years. They finished the tournament in the first round after two consecutive 1–0 losses to Ghana and Egypt and a 1–1 draw against Mali.

In the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, the Cranes progressed to the second round with a 4–0 aggregate win against Togo, and were drawn into a group with Egypt, Ghana and the Republic of Congo. They finished the group with 2 0–0 draws against Ghana, a win and a draw against the Republic of Congo and a victory against Egypt followed by a defeat at the home of the Pharaohs. The 9 points won were not enough for Uganda to qualify against the 13 of the Egyptians who finished first in the standings.

In the qualifiers for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, the Cranes cruised through qualifiers against Tanzania, Cape Verde and Lesotho. In the competition proper, a 2–0 victory against DR Congo meant that the Uganda Cranes had won their first match in the competition for 41 years. In the other 2 games of the group Uganda obtained a draw against Zimbabwe (1–1) and a defeat against the hosts Egypt (2–0) qualifying in second place, to be eliminated in the round of 16 by Senegal (1–0). They qualified for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations after South Sudan beat Congo 3-2 on November 14, 2024.

<text>37452 Spirit (provisional designation ) is a dark Hildian asteroid from the outermost region of the asteroid belt, approximately 9 kilometers in diameter.

The asteroid was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomers Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory, California. It was named after NASA&#x27;s &quot;Spirit&quot; Mars rover.

== Orbit and classification ==
Spirit is a member of the Hilda family of asteroids, which stay in a 3:2 orbital resonance with the gas-giant Jupiter, meaning that for every two orbits Jupiter completes, a Hildian asteroid will complete three orbits. As their orbit does not cross the path of any of the planets, it will therefore not be pulled out of orbit by Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational field and likely remain in a stable orbit for thousands of years.

Spirit orbits the Sun in the outermost main-belt at a distance of 3.1–4.8 AU once every 7 years and 10 months (2,867 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as no precoveries were taken and no prior identifications were made.

=== Palomar–Leiden survey ===
The survey designation &quot;P-L&quot; stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.

== Physical characteristics ==
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Spirit measures 8.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.056, which is typical value for carbonaceous C-type asteroids. It has an absolute magnitude of 14.2.

As of 2017, Spirit&#x27;s rotation period and shape, as well as its spectral type remain unknown.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named by the discoverers for NASA&#x27;s successful Mars rover &quot;Spirit&quot; which had been exploring the rocks and minerals in the Martian Gusev crater. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 September 2004 (). 39382 Opportunity, also an asteroid of the Hilda family and discovered on the same day, was named after &quot;Spirit&quot;″s twin rover, &quot;Opportunity&quot;.

<text>Galston (Lowland Scots: &quot;Gauston&quot;, Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Baile nan Gall&quot;) is a town in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which has a population of 4,710
(2022) and is at the heart of the civil parish of the same name. 

It is situated in wooded countryside upriver from Kilmarnock and is one a group of the small towns located in the Irvine Valley between the towns of Hurlford and Newmilns. To the north of the town is the ruin of Loudoun Castle, the site of Loudoun Castle theme park from 1995 to 2010. In 1874 the population was 4,727.

== Etymology ==
The name Galston means &quot;place of the strangers&quot; from the Gaelic word &quot;Gall&quot; (a stranger), and the &quot;Toun&quot; or &quot;Ton&quot; was a farm and its outbuildings. The word &quot;baile&quot; was anglicised in more recent history as toun like many other place names in Scotland which were originally &quot;bal&quot;.

== Religion and churches ==
* Galston Parish Church, designed by John Brash of Glasgow, built in 1809 on site of a pre-Reformation church. Spire in height. Chancel added 1912 and 3-manual pipe organ by J J Binns 1913. The 17th-century Presbyterians forbade burials taking place within churches. In 1609 John Schaw of Sornbeg decided to bury his recently deceased wife within Galston Kirk. He entered the kirk with a party of armed men and proceeded to break up flagstones and dig a grave where he interred his wife&#x27;s body. He was fined £20 for this action and promised never to attempt this act again.
* St Sophia&#x27;s Church, 1885, Byzantine style church designed by architect Sir Robert Rowand Anderson, based on Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Is a Category A Listed building.

==Areas of interest==
===The Burn Anne===

The Burn Anne joins the Irvine at Galston. It is named after St Anne, said to be the mother of the Virgin Mary. &quot;St Anne&#x27;s Holy Well&quot; is marked on the 1860 OS map and lies above Bank Wood, flowing into the Burn Anne. The Holy Well has been destroyed by the construction of a concrete tank which collects the spring water for Cessnock Castle, first constructed for the Duke of Portland in Victorian times. The Carsewell Hole nearby was used for adult baptism.

The woodlands here have a high plant biodiversity value and are a registered provisional wildlife site as designated by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Species noted in 2007 include woodruff, bird cherry, primrose, common violet, oak, stitchwort, golden male (scaly) fern, bugle, opposite-leaved golden saxifrage, bluebell, dog&#x27;s mercury, broad buckler fern, watercress, lady fern, male shield fern, kidney vetch, woodrush, woodsedge, blackthorn, hawthorn, marsh marigold, foxglove, sweet cicely, herb robert, red campion, bistort, ribwort plantain, water avens, wood avens, moschatel, elm, alder, and many liverworts. A pair of buzzards were noted.

A great danger is the presence of the alien invader, the pink purslane or Stewarton flower, which will spread rapidly and destroy the native herbs by out-competing them (2007). It needs to be removed as matter of urgency.

A new (2008) metalled path has been created through part of these woods, greatly improving access. A new wood has been planted along part of the new path and this will in time extend and protect the habitats and the biodiversity of the site.

This tributary of the Irvine was famous for its rich jasper pebbles; semi-precious stones which were collected, cut and polished for use in jewellery.

===The Barr Castle===

Probably dating from the 15th century, this five-storeyed red sandstone tower castle still stands as a prominent feature (NS 505 360) on a rocky knoll close to the Burn Anne, within the town&#x27;s boundaries. It was also known as Lockhart&#x27;s Tower and was built to control the nearby access points up the Irvine Valley.

William Wallace is said to have taken refuge from pursuing English soldiers within the tower, eventually escaping siege by climbing down an overhanging tree.
It has a practical, if not authentic, roof which does not hide a view of the continuous corbelling of the parapet. The bottom section of the four angle towers are discernible.

The castle was built for the Lockhart family who held the Barony of Galston; enthusiastic opponents of the Catholic faith. In 1670 the property was purchased by the Campbells of Cessnock Castle nearby. In 2019 celebrations will be held to mark the 125th anniversary of the castle being used as a Masonic Lodge by Lodge St. Peter 331. It also houses a museum of local artefacts. The castle is open to the public on occasions and has proved a very popular venue for weddings. In August 1528, James Campbell of Lochlee abducted Alexander Pawtoun from Mauchline and imprisoned him for 5 days in the dungeon (&#x27;spelunca&#x27;) of the Tower of Galston in order to extort the sum of £20. In an old charter of 12 March 1438, John Lockhart, Lord of Barr, provides for an annual rent to be paid to the chaplain for saying three masses annually for the repose of his soul at the altar of the church of Saint Peter in Ardrossan.

The renowned reformer and Protestant martyr George Wishart preached at the castle in 1545 and in 1556 John Knox also preached here; both were under the protection of John Lockart of Barr and his fellow reformers.

===The Judge&#x27;s Hill===
A justice hill survives in a patch of woodland on the Hag Burn near the Loudoun Country Club. This site may have been linked to the old Barony of Galston and the feudal rights of the Campbells of Loudoun.

The site has a nearby lime kiln and old ruins next to the Hag Burn which may have been a forge.

== Galston railway station ==
This station on the Glasgow and South Western Railway line to Stonehouse via Strathaven, closed in 1964.

==Culture==
===The Galston Handball Game===
This game was popular with farm workers who used clenched hands to hit a hard ball off the side wall of the Barr Castle – similar to Gaelic handball and fives, or rather like squash without the use of rackets or a soft, squashy ball. The court was of earth, beaten hard. Galston became World Champions at this handball sport, however it is no longer played, the last official game being in 1939. Local legend has it that the game was used by William Wallace to help keep his men fit for battle.

Handball was popular in these parts during the 19th century and Galston was the site of the most important competition, held on the Saturday of the Glasgow Fair. It belonged to the group of sports that Gaelic handball still represents. John Galt refers to handball being played in Irvine against the back wall of a malt-kiln.

<doc id="1092058" wikidata="Q498420" url="?curid=1092058" title="M. Emmet Walsh">
<text>Michael Emmet Walsh (March 22, 1935 – March 19, 2024) was an American actor who appeared in over 200 films and television series, including supporting roles as Earl Frank in &quot;Straight Time&quot; (1978), the Madman in &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), Captain Bryant in &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), Harv in &quot;Critters&quot; (1986), and Walt Scheel in &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004). He starred as private detective Loren Visser in &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984), the Coen brothers&#x27; first film, for which he won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead.

Walsh&#x27;s other numerous film appearances include &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977), &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983), &quot;Missing in Action&quot; (1984), &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), &quot;Calvary&quot; (2014), and &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019). Over five decades as a character actor, he credited roles in more than 220 films and television shows.

==Early life==
Michael Emmet Walsh was born on March 22, 1935, in Ogdensburg, New York, the son of Agnes Katharine (&quot;née&quot; Sullivan) and Harry Maurice Walsh Sr., who was a customs agent, as were his grandfather and brother. He was of Irish descent, and was raised in rural Swanton, Vermont, where he underwent a mastoid operation at age 3, which left Walsh deaf in his left ear.

He graduated from Clarkson University in 1958 (B.A., Business Administration), and in 1998, the Clarkson Alumni Association presented Walsh with the Golden Knight Award. At Clarkson, Walsh had also dabbled in stage productions, and soon after being encouraged by a faculty advisor, he moved to New York City to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He went on to perform in regional theater for the next decade before making his Broadway debut in 1969, with Al Pacino, in &quot;Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;.

==Career==
According to his manager, Sandy Joseph, &quot;Walsh&#x27;s tremendous body of work includes 119 feature films and more than 250 television productions.&quot; Being partially deaf in one ear and with an accent harkening from Vermont made it clear to Walsh: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to do Shaw and Shakespeare and Molière — my speech was simply too bad.&quot; His persona was a &quot;mesmerising everyman and an indelible gargoyle&quot; who featured &quot;poached-egg eyes.&quot;

Walsh specialized in playing villains who were blissfully oblivious to their villainy. He brought a &quot;delightfully menacing presence&quot; to his characters. He was a no-nonsense worker bee in the film industry. Walsh characterized himself as approaching &quot;each job thinking it might be my last, so it better be the best work possible. I want to be remembered as a working actor. I&#x27;m being paid for what I&#x27;d do for nothing.&quot;

Walsh spent years honing his craft in movie bit parts and on stage. After appearances in the films &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; (1969), &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971), &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (1971), &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), and &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977), Walsh came to prominence in the iconic 1977 hockey comedy film &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, in which he played the cynical small town sportswriter Dickie Dunn, and the 1978 crime film &quot;Straight Time&quot;, in which he played a vicious parole officer opposite Dustin Hoffman. &quot;USA Today&quot; film critic Mike Clark wrote that the film character who was &quot;a cesspool in a flowered shirt&quot; was typically Walsh. He also had a small but memorable role as a crazed sniper in the Steve Martin comedy &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979), followed by roles in the drama films &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), and &quot;Reds&quot; (1981).

===Bigger roles===
One of his best-known roles was Captain Harry Bryant in Ridley Scott&#x27;s cult film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). He characterized &quot;Blade Runner&quot; as being especially difficult and tiresome to make, given director Ridley Scott&#x27;s insistence on perfection. As a hard-bitten police commander, Walsh&#x27;s character brings Deckard (Harrison Ford) out of retirement to &quot;retire&quot; cyborgs, telling Deckard, &quot;I need your magic.&quot; Walsh allowed that he was completely confused as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was filmed, and did not have any idea where it was going.

In 1983, Walsh appeared in Mike Nichols&#x27; biographical film &quot;Silkwood&quot;. In 1984, he was cast as a crooked Texas private eye in the film noir &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, which was the Coen brothers&#x27; first film and resulted in Walsh winning the first Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. Pauline Kael praised Walsh&#x27;s performance: &quot;his broad buffoonery helps to ground the picture, to keep it jaundiced and low-down.&quot; He then reteamed with the Coen brothers for &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; as a memorable &quot;yakking machine shop worker&quot;.

Other prominent film roles include a prostate examining doctor in the Chevy Chase film &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985), a college diving coach in the Rodney Dangerfield film &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), a police chief in the horror film &quot;Critters&quot; (1986), John Lithgow’s father in the Bigfoot comedy &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (1987), the apothecary in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), father of the groom in the romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), the voice of Earl Stutz in animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), the adventure film &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; (2002), and the Christmas comedy film &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004), where he played one of the Kranks&#x27; neighbors. In 1992, he appeared as a powerful U.S. Senator in David Winning&#x27;s Canadian film &quot;Killer Image&quot;. He later appeared as a writer in the Irish comedy-drama film &quot;Calvary&quot; (2014), and a security guard in the mystery film &quot;Knives Out&quot; (2019).

===Television and stage===

On television, in September 1971, Walsh appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of &quot;All in the Family,&quot; and also appeared as Alex Lembeck, a motorcycle cop who appointed himself as Sandy Stockton&#x27;s chaperone and protector on &quot;The Sandy Duncan Show&quot; in 1972. He appeared in an episode of the NBC drama series &quot;Gibbsville&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in 1981. Walsh also made occasional guest appearances on &quot;Home Improvement&quot; as Tim Taylor&#x27;s father-in-law in 1994. Other appearances included &quot;Early Edition&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, and &quot;Frasier&quot;. He also appeared as Dr. Joseph Krofft, a medical examiner with a grudge against Andy Sipowicz, on an episode of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. Later appearances included the series &quot;Sneaky Pete&quot;, and &quot;The Righteous Gemstones&quot;.

On stage, in 2004, Walsh appeared in the London production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Buried Child&quot;.

==Legacy and accolades==
Critic Nicolas Rapold called Walsh &quot;a consummate old pro of the second-banana business&quot;, while Roger Ebert hailed him as &quot;the poet of sleaze&quot;. Ebert also fabricated his &quot;Stanton-Walsh Rule&quot;: &quot;No movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.&quot; Walsh was &quot;ham-faced, heavyset&quot; and &quot;often played good old boys with bad intentions&quot;.

In 2018, Walsh was inducted into the Character Actor Hall of Fame by his &quot;Blade Runner&quot; co-star Harrison Ford. Later in the same ceremony he received the Chairman&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement award.

Walsh had a reputation for generosity and wry wit. He habitually distributed two-dollar bills to the set&#x27;s crew, with some advice: &quot;Don&#x27;t spend it, and you&#x27;ll never be broke.&quot;

==Death==
Walsh died of cardiac arrest at Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, Vermont, on March 19, 2024, three days before his 89th birthday.

<text>Mary Parker Lewis is a political consultant who most famously served as Chief of Staff to Dr. Alan Keyes,
 candidate for President of the United States in 1996 and 2000. In addition to running both Keyes presidential campaigns, Lewis also ran the statesman&#x27;s historic campaign for the U.S. Senate from Illinois against Barack Obama in 2004.

Her political works have come under scrutiny due to reports that in 2010, while these Political Action Committees (PACs) took in millions of dollars in donations, they paid out only a very small percentage to the causes they claim they are working to defend. Mary also took considerable compensation packages as well from these PACs.

Lewis was born and raised in southern California where she attended Scripps College in Claremont. She then completed graduate studies at Claremont Graduate School (now Claremont Graduate University) in her home state and at Notre Dame Institute in Virginia. Early in her career, Lewis served as a staffer with the Free Congress Foundation and the Hoover Institution. She became special assistant to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation and confidential assistant to William Kristol, Chief of Staff to U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett.

Lewis is also known in conservative activist circles as Executive Director of the Declaration Foundation, grassroots organizations founded by Dr. Alan Keyes to advocate the basic principles and core values of the conservative movement in the United States.

<doc id="1092070" wikidata="Q350823" url="?curid=1092070" title="Javier Portillo (Spanish footballer)">
<text>Javier García Portillo (born 30 March 1982) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a forward.

He started out at Real Madrid and appeared in 59 competitive games during his tenure, scoring 17 goals. In La Liga, he also played for Gimnàstic, Osasuna and Hércules for a total of 131 matches and 21 goals, and also competed professionally in Italy and Belgium.

In a 14-year senior career, Portillo represented Hércules in all three major levels of Spanish football.

==Club career==
Portillo was born in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid. In 1994, aged 12, he entered Real Madrid&#x27;s youth system. Over seven seasons he was a prolific scorer, netting 370 goals and breaking a record previously held by Raúl. In August 2002 he signed his first professional contract, running until 2006 with a buyout clause of €15 million.

On 6 October 2002, Portillo made his first La Liga appearance and second overall for the main squad, starting in a 5–2 home win over Deportivo Alavés and ending that season with five goals in only ten games. He also scored a vital last-minute equaliser against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League second group phase, a goal which ultimately proved to be crucial to reach the knockout stages.

Portillo was loaned to Serie A side ACF Fiorentina in July 2004, but was recalled by new manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo, who arrived midway through the 2004–05 campaign. However, the same coach deemed him surplus to requirements and another loan ensued, to Club Brugge KV of the Belgian Pro League.
At the end of this loan period, Portillo returned to Real under newly hired coach Fabio Capello. With new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy adding to already present Raúl, Antonio Cassano and Ronaldo, he was released and signed a two-year contract with recently promoted Gimnàstic de Tarragona.

After a successful individual season (12 goals in all competitions, although the Catalans were relegated from the top flight), in July 2007 Portillo replaced at Osasuna Roberto Soldado, who returned from loan to Real Madrid. He was used irregularly in his first two years, and only netted three times in the league.

In late December 2009, Portillo – who was only fourth or fifth-choice striker for Osasuna coach José Antonio Camacho– finally moved clubs, signing until the end of the season plus two more with Segunda División&#x27;s Hércules CF. After some time to adjust he finished in the starting XI, netting vital goals in the final stretch, including one in the last round for a 2–0 victory at Real Unión as the Alicante side returned to the first division after 13 years.

Portillo returned to reserve status in 2010–11, after Hércules signed David Trezeguet and Nelson Valdez in the off-season. He only started through injury or suspension to the pair, and scored just twice in official matches, one coming in a 3–1 away defeat of Real Sociedad on 3 April 2011, with Hércules being immediately relegated.

On 2 August 2011, Portillo signed for three years with UD Las Palmas in the second tier. For the 2012–13 season, however, he moved teams again, returning to Hércules on a three-year deal.

In late December 2015, Portillo announced his retirement at the age of 33. Subsequently, he worked as his last club&#x27;s director of football.

==International career==
Making his debut in 2002 – shortly after his arrival at the Real Madrid senior setup – Portillo played ten times for Spain under-21s, and scored five goals.

<text>The Z platform or Z-body automobile platform designation was used on three different types of vehicles made by General Motors not including their trucks.

==Chevrolet Corvair==

The first was both generations of the Chevrolet Corvair from 1960 to 1969, which were a rear-wheel-drive and rear-engine compact car.
* The Corvair featured a rear-mounted six-cylinder Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine that included many aluminum components and an aluminum block, along with a rear swing-axle (up to 1964) suspension and rear transaxle. From 1965 the rear suspension was similar to the then current Corvette except that coils were used in place of a transverse leaf. 

Vehicles using the rear-drive/rear-engine Z-body include:
* 1960–1969 Chevrolet Corvair 500
* 1960–1969 Chevrolet Corvair Monza
* 1965–1966 Chevrolet Corvair Corsa

==Chevrolet Corvette==

The second was the Corvette from 1972 until 1975 when the second Y platform was developed for the Corvette. The second digit in the vehicle identification number displays vehicles that used this platform followed by either Body Style 37 for coupe or 67 for convertible.

Vehicles using the front-engine/rear-drive Z-body include:
* 1972–1975 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Sport Coupe
* 1972–1975 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray convertible
==Saturn S-Series==

The third was Saturn&#x27;s automobile platform from its debut in 1990 until 2002, which were front-wheel drive compact cars. This platform was replaced with the GM Delta platform.

Vehicles using the front-drive/front-engine Z-body include:
* 1991–2002 Saturn SC
* 1991–2002 Saturn SL
* 1993–2001 Saturn SW

<doc id="1092073" wikidata="Q2710379" url="?curid=1092073" title="39382 Opportunity">
<text>39382 Opportunity (provisional designation ) is a dark Hilidan asteroid from the outermost region of the asteroid belt, approximately 7.5 kilometers in diameter. Discovered during the Palomar–Leiden survey at Palomar Observatory in 1960, it was named for NASA&#x27;s &quot;Opportunity&quot; Mars rover.

== Discovery ==
Opportunity was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten, as well as Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels from photographic plates taken at the Palomar Observatory, California, United States.

=== Survey designation ===
The survey designation &quot;P-L&quot; stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.

== Orbit and classification ==
Located in the outermost part of the main-belt, Opportunity is a member of the Hilda family, a large group of asteroids that are thought to have originated from the Kuiper belt. They orbit in a 3:2 orbital resonance with the gas giant Jupiter, meaning that for every 2 orbits Jupiter completes around the Sun, a Hildian asteroid will complete 3 orbits.

Opportunity orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.2–4.8 AU once every 7 years and 11 months (2,880 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid&#x27;s orbit does not cross the path of any of the planets and therefore it will not be pulled out of orbit by Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational field. As a result of this, it is likely that the asteroid will remain in a stable orbit for thousands of years.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as no precoveries were taken and no prior identifications were made.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Opportunity measures 7.45 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.061, which is typical for carbonaceous asteroids. A generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, gives a diameter of 7 kilometers, for an absolute magnitude of 14.5 and an assumed albedo of 0.05.

=== Lightcurves ===
As of 2017, the asteroid&#x27;s composition, shape and rotation period remain unknown.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named after a Mars Exploration Rover, &quot;Opportunity&quot;, following a proposal by the discoverer Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 September 2004 (). The minor planet 37452 Spirit was named for &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s twin rover, &quot;Spirit&quot;.

<text>David Crane (born 1954) is an American video game designer and programmer. Crane grew up fascinated by technology and went to DeVry Institute of Technology. Following college, he went to Silicon Valley and got his first job at National Semiconductor. Through his friend Alan Miller he learned about potential video game design work at Atari, Inc. and began work there in 1977.

After Crane and other programmers felt they were not being paid fairly at Atari, he left the company in 1979. Crane and Miller formed Activision, the first company to independently publish games for the Atari 2600. The company grew to be massively successful, with Crane&#x27;s game &quot;Pitfall!&quot; (1982) being one the biggest sellers for the company. Crane continued to work for Activision making several games for the Atari 2600 and later the Commodore 64. After Activision hired Bruce Davis as the new CEO, Crane left Activison and later joined Garry Kitchen at Absolute Entertainment. At Absolute, Crane began working on several games for the Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

After Absolute closed in 1995, Crane formed Skyworks Technologies, who made browser games in the mid-1990s and was among the first developers of a type of game later known as advergames. While at Skyworks, Crane designed two of the companies biggest App store sellers with &quot;Arcade Bowling&quot; and &quot;Arcade Hoops Basketball&quot;. In the 2010s, Crane developed games for AppStar for iPhone and iPad and by the end of the decade created Audacity Games, a company that developed games for older consoles such as the Atari 2600.

==Biography==
===Early life===
David Crane was born in Nappanee, Indiana in 1954. When he was young, Crane was fascinated by technology and engineering. He dismantled a black and white television to create a channel tuner near his bedside and make a TV in a cabinet on his wall and create a laser that could ignite a match at the end of a workbench. He intended to work on making gadgets that would help people in their lives but, in 2010, he reflected that &quot;...video game design was even a better fit for that combination of skills. But as I was growing up there was no such thing as a videogame, so how could I know?&quot; Crane&#x27;s first encounter with a video game was with the Magnavox Odyssey that his parents bought him. He later admitted he was &quot;bored by the rudimentary games&quot; but was fascinated by the technology&#x27;s potential.

Crane first encountered a computer through a Boy Scout master who worked in data processing and began learning Hollerith code for punched cards. He attended a computer programming extension campus. Once Crane graduated in 1972, he could code in three different programming languages. Crane went to the DeVry Institute of Technology in Phoenix, Arizona. He completed the four-year course in 33 months and received his degree in electrical engineering.

===National Semiconductor and Atari===
Following college, he moved to Silicon Valley and got his first job at National Semiconductor in 1975. At the company, he worked on linear integrated circuits in order to become proficient in electronic design.

While playing tennis with Alan Miller, he was told by his friend that Atari was looking for game programmers. After proofreading a newspaper ad his friend had made for the position, Crane wrote a resume, was interviewed the next day at 10 am and had the job by 2 pm. Crane joined Atari in the third quarter of 1977 and first began producing Arcade-inspired titles such as &quot;Outlaw&quot; and &quot;Canyon Bomber&quot; for the Atari VCS (later known as the Atari 2600). Crane was initially unsure about programming games, but found he enjoyed microprocessor programming and game design. Atari began their new line of computers with the Atari 800 and required help with software development. This led to Atari having all of its game designers, including Crane, step in to work on the machine&#x27;s operating system.

In 1979, Crane and other game developers at Atari, including Miller, Larry Kaplan, and Bob Whitehead received a memo indicating that their games were the most financially successful for Atari, making up $60 million of Atari&#x27;s $100 million game cartridge sales in 1978. As they were making a salary of $30,000, they asked for a raise and, according to Crane, were told by Ray Kassar that Crane was &quot;no more important to the success of those products than the person on the assembly line who puts them together.&quot;

===Activision===
Crane and Miller left Atari in August 1979. They had a plan to create an independent development and publishing company to produce games for Atari&#x27;s VCS console, which had not been attempted previously. Crane was suggested by a lawyer to Jim Levy in 1979. Levy had been working for GRT Records and was raising money to go into business making cassette tape software and believed abilities in marketing and the business skills to help create their new company Activision.

Initially working out of Crane&#x27;s apartment, Miller and Crane began programming a development system for Activision. Whitehead and Kaplan joined shortly after. Activision had a five-year business plan, to initially make video games during the slow growth of the home computer and switch over to computers in the future. Activision&#x27;s first games came out in 1980, including Crane&#x27;s &quot;Dragster&quot; and &quot;Fishing Derby&quot;. The following year saw the release of Crane&#x27;s &quot;Freeway&quot; while Crane also contributed to other developers&#x27; games, such as the graphics code in Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;Kaboom!&quot;. In 1982, Activision released Crane&#x27;s game &quot;Pitfall!&quot; which was one of the company&#x27;s biggest sellers.

Activision went public in 1983. Crane spoke positively about working at the company in the early 1980s, saying that due to their rapid success &quot;everyone wanted to work [at Activision]. [...] When Activision reached sales of $60 million, we had 60 employees. People have to work pretty hard for a company to have revenues of $1 million per employee.&quot; Crane followed &quot;Pitfall!&quot; with two games: &quot;The Activision Decathlon&quot; (1983), which was developed with the impetus that the Olympics would be returning to the United States in 1984, and a sequel titled &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot; (1984). Crane stated he made the sequel to &quot;Pitfall!&quot; &quot;at a time when the Atari 2600 should have been replaced by a new gaming system.&quot; and designed a custom computer chip called the Display Processor Chip that was unique to &quot;Pitfall II: Lost Caverns&quot;.

Following the video game crash of 1983 and the release of &quot;Pitfall II&quot;, Crane began focusing to transition into developing computer games at Activision. Crane felt the Commodore 64 (C64) had sold well enough to be a good platform to design games for. Crane reflected on adapting to programming for the C64 as a &quot;mixed blessing&quot;, specifically finding that the tools he had been using were now obsolete and that they needed to create new development systems, compressors and decompressors, audio and sound effect drivers. He summarized it as &quot;imagine, in whatever your job might be, that every two years or so, everything changes.&quot; The first game he made, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) which was finished in six weeks using work Crane had been developing for a game called &quot;Car Wars&quot;. The game went on to become the Activision title that was received the most ports across consoles and home computers. His next game, &quot;Little Computer People&quot; (1985) was a critical success while failing commercially. Crane later said that &quot;there was so much programming in [&quot;Little Computer People&quot;] that it cost more to produce than it made at retail. We had dozens of ideas for follow-up products, but if those ideas were going to lose money the company couldn&#x27;t afford to produce them. I regret that we were unable to follow those ideas to see what might have become of the first large-scale simulated life form on a computer.&quot; In 1985, Activision began the process of acquiring game company Infocom. As the deal was signed, Activision&#x27;s board of directors replaced Levy and brought in Bruce Davis as the new CEO. Crane left Activision in 1987, later explaining that Activision&#x27;s management &quot;had no creative vision at all, I left when I could no longer affect the future of the company.&quot; He also noted a pay issue, saying that &quot;the new president, Bruce Davis, asked me to take a fraction of my salary, with the rest made up through an incentive bonus. I asked him to put the bonus in clear terms in writing and he couldn&#x27;t [...] He just slashed my salary without a compensating bonus. So I left.&quot;

===Absolute Entertainment===
Following Activision, Crane worked independently, including finishing research work on a video game system for Hasbro. By January 1989, Crane became the Senior Designer at the publishing company Absolute Entertainment, a company formed by former Activision staff member Garry Kitchen. Kitchen contacted the Japanese company Nintendo for the rights to develop games for their Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console, which led to him being continuously rejected by the company. This led to Crane creating a development system for the NES, making them be the first company in North America to be licensed to program games for the NES.

At Absolute, Crane worked on titles for the Atari 2600, the NES, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Among these games at were &quot;Super Skateboardin&quot;&#x27;, several games based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; license, and two of his own creations: &quot;A Boy and his Blob&quot; (1990) and &quot;David Crane&#x27;s Amazing Tennis&quot; (1992).

Crane recalled in a 2005 interview with Frank Cifaldi that the team &quot;had a lot of fun on the development side, but under the rule of Nintendo, the publishing side of the game business was really tough.&quot; Crane said that to make any profit, the publisher had to predict how many games would sell in the market, saying that &quot;If their estimate was off by 10% either way they were likely to lose money on the game.&quot; Absolute closed in 1995. Crane recalled that &quot;It was painful to close down Absolute, but the same was happening to small publishers all around the world.&quot;

===Skyworks Technologies===
Following the demise of Absolute, Kitchen and Crane went into business making games that did not require inventory and began developing games for web browsers. Believing that audiences would be too afraid to give out information such as credit cards online, they developed a business model that later became known as advergaming which involved allowing their games to be played for free but licensing them to other companies&#x27; websites.

Among the games they developed built and launched Candystand for The Lifesavers Company. Crane and Skyworks took a percentage of their promotions budget and built a place to play games. Crane and company also developed a site similar to Candystand for ESPN. Crane called this &quot;moderately successful arrangement, only limited by the learning curve of their salespeople who could never quite understand the difference between sponsorship and advertising.&quot; While at Skyworks, Crane designed two of the company&#x27;s biggest App store sellers with &quot;Arcade Bowling&quot; and &quot;Arcade Hoops Basketball&quot;.

===Later work===

In 2010, Crane and Kitchen began work at AppStar. Kitchen served as president and CEO while Crane was the company&#x27;s chief technical officer. They published their first game, &quot;Iron Horse&quot; in 2010. Crane began reflecting on his career in 2010 and started writing and gathering material about working on Atari 2600 games. He considered publishing them to magazines or as a book, but opted to release them through AppStar Games on the iPhone, initially writing a work on &quot;Dragster&quot; but starting with a 2600 primer titled &quot;2600 Magic&quot; as an app. Crane later created a crowdfunding campaign Kickstarter in 2012 to fund a spiritual successor to &quot;Pitfall!&quot;, which fell far short of his funding goal.

In the late 2010s, Crane and Kitchen created a company focused on hardware technology that made cartridges and ROM boards for development of Atari 2600 games. Early in 2021, Crane, Garry Kitchen and his brother Dan Kitchen launched Audacity Games, a company dedicated to making new games for old consoles. Their first title, &quot;Circus Convoy&quot;, was released in 2021 for the Atari 2600.
==Legacy==
In January 1983, &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; awarded David Crane as the Designer of the Year for &quot;Pitfall!&quot; in their Awards of Excellence for 1982. &quot;Pitfall!&quot; remained the game that Crane has been most associated with. In 2012, he stated that &quot;I suppose that&#x27;s not a bad problem to have, It&#x27;s not a dark shadow. But I&#x27;m not just a classic gaming guy. This is what I do for a living!&quot;

In February 2010, Crane became the first recipient of the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Pioneer award. The award is reserved for people whose work has shaped and defined the interactive entertainment industry.

IGN listed David Crane on their list of the top 100 game creators of all time at number 12.

==Personal life==
Outside engineering and video game development, Crane was an avid tennis player. Crane had played tournament tennis for decades, as well as playing in doubles with Alan Miller. While working at Absolute, Crane felt his video game career did not allow him to play enough tennis and enrolled at an expert tennis class at Cañada College. Crane said that during his adult life, he performed at the rating of 5.0 on the NTRP (National Tennis Rating Program) scale, a standardized scale Crane described as being from 1.0 for beginner to &quot;7.0 for Roger Federer&quot;. In 2010, Crane said he still plays tennis in tournament league competitions, but due to age and injuries he is no longer at the 5.0 level.

Despite his love for the sport, Crane stated he never had interest in developing a tennis-themed game until he began developing games for the Super Nintendo, specifically with &quot;David Crane&#x27;s Amazing Tennis&quot;.

<doc id="1092083" wikidata="Q4800957" url="?curid=1092083" title="Articulation (education)">
<text>Articulation, or more specifically course articulation, is the process of comparing the content of courses that are transferred between postsecondary institutions such as TAFE institutes, colleges or universities. In other words, course articulation is the process by which one institution matches its courses or requirements to coursework completed at another institution. Students rely on course articulation to assure themselves that the courses they have completed or intend to complete will not need to be repeated at the institution to which they are transferring.

Course articulation is distinct from the process of acceptance by one institution of earned credit, from another institution, as applicable towards its degree requirements, i.e. &quot;transferring credit&quot;. For example, a university may count units of academic credit earned at a community college towards its minimum number of units for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. But it might not treat certain previously taken courses as good as its own specific course requirements for a particular major or concentration for that same degree, if the articulation process reveals that the other institution&#x27;s course curricula are not equivalent to or not as rigorous as its own course curricula. In that latter situation, a transferring student may discover they cannot graduate until they take courses at the second institution which partially overlap or repeat material they have previously studied at the first one.

Course articulation may be done on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis when a student actually wishes to transfer. It may also be done pursuant to existing course-to-course comparison data, or based on formal articulation agreements. In the last case, representatives of each institution compare their respective course curricula, to determine which courses are comparable and which are not. Their consensus is then formalized in a written agreement which is used by students and advisors and is regularly updated according to a mutual schedule. 

Articulation agreements are notoriously difficult to keep up-to-date where one institution (usually a research university) is significantly larger and more prestigious than the other one (usually a junior college, community college, or liberal arts college) and the field of study at issue is evolving very rapidly (especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The larger and more prestigious institution is constantly revising and improving its course curricula to keep up with cutting-edge developments, meaning that inbound transfers from smaller and less prestigious institutions are always aiming at a moving target on the basis of coursework at their prior institution which may be several years behind the state of the art. 

Articulation between institutions with different academic terms is particularly difficult. For example, an institution on the quarter system may have three first-year courses in a subject, while an institution on a semester system may have two first-year courses. While both might cover approximately the same material by the end of one academic year, they may tackle subtopics in a different order, meaning that a student who transfers without taking the entire sequence at one institution will have significant knowledge gaps.

Although credit transfer can be conducted between education bodies in separate countries, the process of articulation can become very complicated when students transfer courses earned at multiple and international campuses, transfer courses from more than 5–10 years ago, or have alternative credit experiences such as exam or military credit.

<text>Norec (from English &quot;Norwegian Agency for Exchange Cooperation&quot;) is a Norwegian governmental body financing two-way mutual personnel exchange between companies and organisations in Norway and similar companies and organisations in the global South – that is countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Previous to 2018, the organisation was named FK Norway.

Norec was founded as Fredskorpset (meaning &quot;the Peace Corps&quot; in Norwegian) in 1963, based on ideas of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s American Peace Corps. It was relaunched in 2000 to promote mutual international exchange of young people.

Norec is an administrative body, reporting to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It funds exchange programmes between various colleges, organisations, businesses etc. in the southern and northern hemispheres.

By 2018, more than 9000 participants had been posted abroad for an average period of one year. FK Norway has regional networks in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Norway.

Tor Elden was secretary general and later director of FK Norway in the period 2000–2008. He was succeeded by Nita Kapoor, who was the director from 2009 to 2018. Jan Olav Baarøy has served as the Director General since 2018.

Until 2018, the head office was located in Oslo. That year it was moved to Førde as part of the national government&#x27;s decentralisation policy. It also has regional offices in Uganda and Thailand.

<doc id="1092099" wikidata="Q2471473" url="?curid=1092099" title="GameShark">
<text>GameShark is the brand name of a line of video game cheat cartridges and other products for a variety of console video game systems and Windows-based computers. Since January 23rd, 2003, the brand name has been owned by Mad Catz, which marketed GameShark products for the Sony PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo game consoles. Players load cheat codes from GameShark discs or cartridges onto the console&#x27;s internal or external memory, so that when the game is loaded, the selected cheats can be applied.

==Products==
When the original GameShark was released, it came with 4,000 preloaded codes. Codes could be entered, but unlike the Game Genie, codes were saved in the onboard flash memory and could be accessed later rather than having to be reentered. The cartridges also acted as memory cards, with equal or greater storage capacity to the consoles&#x27; first party memory cards. It was originally released for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles in January 1996. It was a runner-up for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Best Peripheral of 1996 (behind the Saturn analog controller).
A GameShark was released for the Nintendo 64 in late August 1997. The Nintendo 64 GameShark also bypasses the console&#x27;s regional lockout, allowing games from any region to be played on the same unit.
A GameShark was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002.

<doc id="1092100" wikidata="Q1179615" url="?curid=1092100" title="Brian Little">
<text>Brian Little (born 25 November 1953) is an English football manager and former player.

As a player, Little was a striker who spent his entire career for Aston Villa in a career that spanned from 1971 to 1980. He made 247 league appearances, scoring 60 goals and earning a single cap for England in 1975. As a player he won the Football League Cup on two occasions in 1975 and 1977.

As a manager he has been in charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers and Darlington before taking a job in with Leicester City, during his tenure he secured promotion to the Premier League by winning the play-offs in 1994. He was then appointed as manager of fellow top flight side Aston Villa where he went on to win the Football League Cup in 1996. He had later spells in charge of Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Tranmere Rovers, Wrexham, Gainsborough Trinity and Jersey.

==Playing career==
On leaving school in May 1969, Little signed for Aston Villa who would be relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time in their history the following season. He played a full season for the Aston Villa Youth side and subsequently made his senior debut on 30 October 1971, in a 4–1 win over Blackburn Rovers in the Third Division at Villa Park. He only made two senior appearances that season but was a key player in Villa&#x27;s FA Youth Cup winning side of 1972. By 1973–74, with Villa in the Second Division, he was a regular first team player. He made 247 appearances for the club and scored 60 goals, and made one full international appearance for England in 1975.

He was part of Villa&#x27;s League Cup winning teams of 1975 and 1977, scoring two goals in the second replay victory over Everton in the latter final, as well as helping the club climb from the Third to First Division in the early part of the decade, scoring 20 league goals in the 1974–75 season when they were runners-up and clinched promotion to the First Division. His playing career came to a halt in 1980 when he retired at the age of 26 due to a knee injury.

Ironically , the previous year it was a congenital spinal defect that was detected in x-rays when Little was undergoing a medical at Villa&#x27;s local rivals Birmingham City. This meant his intended transfer there was cancelled. He was a flamboyant forward who formed a particularly prolific partnership with Andy Gray. Little is regarded as an all-time great at Villa Park, and in 2007 he was named as one of the 12 founder members of the Aston Villa Hall of Fame.

==Coaching and managerial career==
Although his playing career was over, Little remained on the Aston Villa payroll as youth team coach. When manager Tony Barton was sacked in the summer of 1984, Little&#x27;s contract was also terminated and he became first-team coach of Wolverhampton Wanderers.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Brian Little was appointed caretaker manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 31 August 1986 as successor to Sammy Chapman. His appointment came at the end of the blackest spell in the club&#x27;s history, when three successive relegations had dragged them from the First Division to the Fourth. He oversaw a steady start to the 1986–87 season before Graham Turner was appointed manager 36 days later.

===Middlesbrough===
Shortly after leaving Wolverhampton, Little was recruited as a first team coach by Middlesbrough manager Bruce Rioch. Like Wolves, Middlesbrough were a financially troubled club and had narrowly escaped bankruptcy. Little was an important part of the club&#x27;s coaching staff as Middlesbrough&#x27;s form improved, and with two successive promotions they were in the First Division for the 1988–89 season. The season ended in relegation for Middlesbrough but in February Little left the Ayresome Park coaching staff and became manager of Darlington.

===Darlington===
Darlington were bottom of the Football League in the Fourth Division. He was unable to prevent them from getting relegated to the Conference but they were promoted back into the League at the first time of asking. 1990–91 brought more success for Little and Darlington as they won the Fourth Division championship, and by this stage he was on the radar of bigger clubs looking to appoint a new manager.

===Leicester City===
In June 1991, Leicester City appointed Little as their replacement for Gordon Lee. The Foxes had just avoided relegation to the Third and Little was chosen as the man to turn the club&#x27;s fortunes around. They emerged as promotion contenders in his first season in charge at Filbert Street.

At the end of 1991–92, Leicester came fourth in the Second Division and qualified for the promotion playoffs, the winners securing a place in the new Premier League. They overcame Cambridge United in the semi-finals and were drawn with Blackburn Rovers in the final. But their promotion hopes were dashed when Blackburn striker Mike Newell, a former Leicester player, scored a penalty which took the Lancashire side into the new league. At the end of the 1992–93 season, Leicester qualified for the playoffs again in the new Division One. They overcame Portsmouth in the semi-finals but in the final were 3–0 down shortly after half-time to Swindon Town. They fought back to bring the scoreline to 3–3, however Swindon scored a controversial late fourth goal from the penalty spot to progress to the Premier League.

In 1993–94, however, Leicester won their third consecutive play-offs with a 2–1 win in the final against East Midlands rivals Derby County. This was Leicester&#x27;s first win in a Wembley final after seven attempts, and took them back into the top flight after a seven-year absence.

In November 1994, following the dismissal of Aston Villa manager Ron Atkinson, Little was linked with a return to Villa Park as manager. Leicester, meanwhile, were struggling among the elite and they went on to be relegated in second from bottom place, with just six league wins all season. With Villa yet to appoint a successor to Atkinson, Little resigned as Leicester manager later that month.

Earlier in the year, former Middlesbrough youth coach Little had been linked with a return to the Teesside club as manager following the departure of Lennie Lawrence, but the job went to Bryan Robson instead.

===Aston Villa===
Within days of quitting Leicester, Little was confirmed as Villa&#x27;s new manager. 
Villa had finished runners-up in the first Premier League 18 months earlier, but were now in the relegation battle. A 1–1 draw with relegated Norwich City on the last day of the season meant Villa&#x27;s relegation battle had been won.

Under Little, young players like Mark Bosnich (179) and Ugo Ehiogu (237) were now getting more first team chances, but Villa also made a large number of new signings between November 1994 and August 1995, including Ian Taylor (233), Mark Draper (120), Gary Charles (107) and Savo Milošević (90). The revamped, younger Villa team gelled well, and 1995–96 was a successful season at Villa Park. The club finished fourth in the Premiership, reached the FA Cup semi-finals and won the Football League Cup with a 3–0 win over Leeds United at Wembley, securing UEFA Cup qualification for the fourth time in six seasons.

Villa qualified for the 1996–97 UEFA Cup and although they were knocked out at the first stage by Swedish side Helsingborg, they qualified for the 1997–98 competition after finishing fifth in the Premiership. In February 1998, Little resigned after just over three years as Aston Villa manager, with the club in the bottom half of the Premiership. His successor John Gregory turned things around, with a seventh place finish clinching a UEFA Cup place.

===Stoke City===
Little was appointed manager of Stoke City in May 1998, just after their relegation to Division Two. Little arrived with the only objective was to gain an instant return to the First Division in 1998–99. Stoke began the season in fine form winning 14 of their first 20 matches and they looked well placed for automatic promotion. However their form completely fell away after Christmas and won just seven matches from the remaining 26 and ended up finishing in 8th position. One of those defeats was a 2–0 loss against nine-men Millwall, which Little described as &quot;the worst result in my twelve years in management&quot;. In July 1999 Little resigned and stated: &quot;I have tried my best and the disappointment is very hard to take. I hope the supporters understand that it&#x27;s best that I leave&quot;.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Little made a quick return to management when he was appointed manager of West Bromwich Albion. The club were languishing in Division One and had been outside the top division since 1986, but continued to struggle in the league under Little.

In January 2000 the promising Italian midfielder Enzo Maresca was transferred to Juventus for £4 million as Albion battled against relegation. Little was sacked in March 2000 after just eight months in charge and replaced by Gary Megson, who guided Albion to promotion two years later.

===Hull City===
In April 2000, just one month after leaving the Hawthorns, Little was appointed manager of Division Three strugglers Hull City. The Tigers were hit by huge debts and were locked out of Boothferry Park for one game by the landlord, former tennis player David Lloyd. By the end of the 2000–01 season, Hull had been saved from closure by new owner Adam Pearson, and the club&#x27;s future looked brighter. They reached the Division Three playoffs, but lost to Leyton Orient in the semi-finals.

In autumn 2001, following the dismissal of manager Peter Taylor, media reports suggested that Little was going to be approached by Leicester City about a possible second spell as manager, but the job went to Dave Bassett instead. By February 2002 Hull City looked well on course for automatic promotion from Division Three. But Little unexpectedly announced his resignation from the club, and under his successor Jan Mølby, the club&#x27;s fortunes slipped dramatically and they could not even finish high enough for a play-off place.

===Tranmere Rovers===
In October 2003, Little made a return to football management with Tranmere Rovers, who were in Division Two.

His first season with the Merseyside club was a success. When he took over they were battling against relegation. But by the end of the season they had climbed up to eighth place and had reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup. He won the Second Division manager of the month award for April 2004. In his first full season as manager, he guided Tranmere to a third-place finish in League One but they lost in the playoffs to miss out on promotion.

Tranmere began 2005–06 as League One promotion favourites, but at the turn of 2006 they were facing a relegation battle. The club only avoided relegation with one game to go and, due to the club&#x27;s poor finishing position in League One, he left the club by mutual consent on 5 May 2006.

===Wrexham===
Out-of-work Little was linked with a return to management with both Gillingham and Port Vale. However, in November 2007, Little took the reins at Wrexham, replacing Brian Carey. With five games remaining in the season the club were in the relegation zone, seven points off safety. They were relegated to the Conference on 22 April 2008 after a 2–0 loss at Hereford United. However, Little signed a two-year contract, promising to revive the club&#x27;s fortunes.

The 2008-09 season started well, with a 5–0 home victory against Stevenage Borough, another team expected to challenge for promotion. however, a run of poor results followed, with Wrexham being left in the mid-table battle, only four points above the relegation zone and only keeping two clean sheets all season. Following a 3–0 home defeat against Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Little left Wrexham by mutual consent.

===Gainsborough Trinity===
On 28 August 2009, Little was appointed manager of Conference North side Gainsborough Trinity. The club had moved to appoint him following the recent dismissal of manager Steve Charles and the resignation of his coaching staff which included formerly appointed caretaker managers Dave Reeves and Steve Blatherwick. However, Little would not take charge of the club&#x27;s away fixture the following day against Farsley Celtic after it was announced he would not take over from player/caretaker manager Adie Moses until 7 September. Little began building a squad of professionals at Trinity, picking up many players from the Football League and other ex-League players from the Conference National, but despite boasting a large squad of experienced players Trinity narrowly avoided relegation to the Northern Premier League during the 2010–11 season. On 22 August 2011 following one win and two defeats in the opening weeks of the 2011–12 season, Little was sacked as manager of Trinity with Steve Housham taking over as caretaker manager.

===Jersey===
Little was appointed as the Jersey FA&#x27;s Director of Football in November 2014, overseeing the work of first team manager Jimmy Reilly. Reilly went on to lead the islanders to their first Muratti Vase Final victory in four years the following May. Months later, Jersey announced their intention to join UEFA, and when Reilly stepped aside in early 2016 Little was appointed to replace him.

Little won the Muratti in May 2016, but stepped down as manager the following month and reverted to his position as Director of Football; allowing him to concentrate on his commitments at Aston Villa. In January 2024, Little was named by Aston Villa as a member of the &quot;Honorary Anniversary Board&quot; ahead of the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary season.

<doc id="1092109" wikidata="Q1061311" url="?curid=1092109" title="Baculites">
<text>Baculites is an extinct genus of heteromorph ammonite cephalopods with almost straight shells. The genus, which lived worldwide throughout most of the Late Cretaceous, and which briefly survived the K-Pg mass extinction event, was named by Lamarck in 1799.

== Shell anatomy ==
The adult shell of &quot;Baculites&quot; is generally straight and may be either smooth or with sinuous striae or ribbing that typically slant dorso-ventrally forward. The aperture likewise slopes to the front and has a sinuous margin. The venter is narrowly rounded to acute while the dorsum is more broad. The juvenile shell, found at the apex, is coiled in one or two whorls and described as minute, about in diameter. Adult &quot;Baculites&quot; ranged in size from about (&quot;Baculites larsoni&quot;) up to in length.

As with other ammonites, the shell consisted of a series of camerae, or chambers, that were connected to the animal by a narrow tube called a siphuncle by which gas content and thereby buoyancy could be regulated in the same manner as &quot;Nautilus&quot; does today. The chambers are separated by walls called septa. The line where each septum meets the outer shell is called the suture or suture line. Like other true ammonites, &quot;Baculites&quot; have intricate suture patterns on their shells that can be used to identify different species.

One notable feature about &quot;Baculites&quot; is that the males may have been a third to a half the size of the females and may have had much lighter ribbing on the surface of the shell.

== Orientation ==
The shell morphology of &quot;Baculites&quot; with slanted striations or ribbing, similarly slanted aperture, and more narrowly rounded to acute keel-like venter points to its having had a horizontal orientation in life as an adult. This same type of cross section is found in much earlier nautiloids such as &quot;Bassleroceras&quot; and &quot;Clitendoceras&quot; from the Ordovician period, which can be shown to have had a horizontal orientation. In spite of this, some researchers have concluded that Baculites lived in a vertical orientation, head hanging straight down, since lacking an apical counterweight, movement was largely restricted to that direction. More recent research, notably by Gerd Westermann, has reaffirmed that at least some &quot;Baculites&quot; species in fact lived in a more or less horizontal orientation.

== Ecology ==
From shell isotope studies, it is thought that &quot;Baculites&quot; inhabited the middle part of the water column, not too close to either the bottom or surface of the ocean. In some rock deposits &quot;Baculites&quot; are common, and they are thought to have lived in great shoals. However, they are not known to occur so densely as to be rock-forming, as do certain other extinct, straight-shelled cephalopods (e.g., orthocerid nautiloids). Studies on exceptionally preserved specimens have revealed a radula by synchrotron imagery. The results suggest that &quot;Baculites&quot; fed on pelagic zooplankton (as suggested by remains of a larval gastropod and a pelagic isopod inside the mouth).

== Convergent evolution ==
&quot;Baculites&quot; and related Cretaceous straight ammonite cephalopods are often confused with the superficially similar orthocerid nautiloid cephalopods. Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other&#x27;s names). Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently, and at different times in earth history. The orthocerid nautiloids mostly lived much earlier (common during the Paleozoic Era, possibly going extinct in the Early Cretaceous) than &quot;Baculites&quot; (Late Cretaceous-Danian only). The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: it is simple in orthocerid nautiloids and intricately folded in &quot;Baculites&quot; and related ammonoids.

==Species distribution==

Cenomanian:

&quot;Baculites gracilis&quot; is known from the Cenomanian Britton Formation.

Turonian:

&quot;Baculites undulatus&quot;, from the upper Turonian of Europe.

Campanian:

The lower part of the Campanian stage (Upper Cretaceous) in the Western Interior of North America has yielded &quot;Baculites gilberti&quot;, early &quot;B. perplexus&quot;, &quot;B. asperiformis&quot;, &quot;B. maclearni&quot;, and &quot;B. obtusus&quot;, followed temporally by late &quot;Baculites perplexus&quot; and then by &quot;Baculites scotti&quot;. The upper part of the upper Campanian has yielded, from older to younger, &quot;B. compressus&quot;, &quot;B. coneatus&quot;, &quot;B. reesidei&quot;. &quot;B. jenseni&quot;, and &quot;B. ellasi&quot;, followed sequentially in the lower Maastrictian by &quot;Baculites baculus&quot;, &quot;B. grandis&quot;, and &quot;B. clinolobatis&quot;.

&quot;Baculites pacificum&quot; is known from the Campanian of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and &quot;Baculites leopoliensis&quot; from the Upper Campanian of Europe.

Maastrichtian/Danian:

The type species, &quot;Baculites vertebralis&quot; is from the upper Maastrichtian and Danian, and is one of the very last species of ammonites. Findings in Denmark and the Netherlands suggest the species survived the K-Pg mass extinction event, albeit being restricted to the Danian. &quot;Baculites anceps&quot; is also known from Europe, although only from the Upper Maastrichtian.

&quot;Baculites ovatus&quot; is known from the Maastrichtian deposits of Ripley Formation in McNairy County, Tennessee, and Severn Formation in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

== Cultural significance ==
&quot;Baculites&quot; fossils are very brittle and almost always break. They are most commonly found broken in half or several pieces, usually along suture lines. Individual chambers found this way are sometimes referred to as &quot;stone buffaloes&quot; (due to their shapes), though the Native-American attribution typically given as part of the story behind the name is likely apocryphal. The Blackfoot have oral traditions that tell a story of the Iniskimm (Buffalo Calling Stone). They are still in use today by Indigenous peoples.

&quot;Baculites ovatus&quot;, the first species of &quot;Baculites&quot; described in the Americas, was described by Thomas Say in 1820 from a single specimen from the Navesink Formation in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. The specimen was later illustrated by Samuel George Morton, who published an etching in 1828. After the death of the specimen&#x27;s owner, the Quaker scientist Reuben Haines III, in 1831, the specimen was lost for 180 years until it was rediscovered at Haines&#x27;s home, the historic Wyck House, in 2017 by Matthew Halley.

<doc id="1092110" wikidata="Q900371" url="?curid=1092110" title="Bulk modulus">
<text>The bulk modulus (formula_1 or formula_2 or formula_3) of a substance is a measure of the resistance of a substance to bulk compression. It is defined as the ratio of the infinitesimal pressure increase to the resulting &quot;relative&quot; decrease of the volume.

Other moduli describe the material&#x27;s response (strain) to other kinds of stress: the shear modulus describes the response to shear stress, and Young&#x27;s modulus describes the response to normal (lengthwise stretching) stress. For a fluid, only the bulk modulus is meaningful. For a complex anisotropic solid such as wood or paper, these three moduli do not contain enough information to describe its behaviour, and one must use the full generalized Hooke&#x27;s law. The reciprocal of the bulk modulus at fixed temperature is called the isothermal compressibility.

==Definition==
The bulk modulus formula_1 (which is usually positive) can be formally defined by the equation
:formula_5
where formula_6 is pressure, formula_7 is the initial volume of the substance, and formula_8 denotes the derivative of pressure with respect to volume. Since the volume is inversely proportional to the density, it follows that 
:formula_9
where formula_10 is the initial density and formula_11 denotes the derivative of pressure with respect to density. The inverse of the bulk modulus gives a substance&#x27;s compressibility. Generally the bulk modulus is defined at constant temperature as the isothermal bulk modulus, but can also be defined at constant entropy as the adiabatic bulk modulus.

==Thermodynamic relation==
Strictly speaking, the bulk modulus is a thermodynamic quantity, and in order to specify a bulk modulus it is necessary to specify how the pressure varies during compression: constant-temperature (isothermal formula_12), constant-entropy (isentropic formula_13), and other variations are possible. Such distinctions are especially relevant for gases.

For an ideal gas, an isentropic process has:

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the heat capacity ratio. Therefore, the isentropic bulk modulus formula_13 is given by

:formula_17

Similarly, an isothermal process of an ideal gas has:

:formula_18

Therefore, the isothermal bulk modulus formula_12 is given by

:formula_20 .

When the gas is not ideal, these equations give only an approximation of the bulk modulus. In a fluid, the bulk modulus formula_1 and the density formula_10 determine the speed of sound formula_23 (pressure waves), according to the Newton-Laplace formula

:formula_24

In solids, formula_13 and formula_12 have very similar values. Solids can also sustain transverse waves: for these materials one additional elastic modulus, for example the shear modulus, is needed to determine wave speeds.

== Measurement ==
It is possible to measure the bulk modulus using powder diffraction under applied pressure.
It is a property of a fluid which shows its ability to change its volume under its pressure.

==Selected values==


A material with a bulk modulus of 35 GPa loses one percent of its volume when subjected to an external pressure of 0.35 GPa (~) (assumed constant or weakly pressure dependent bulk modulus).
== Microscopic origin ==
=== Interatomic potential and linear elasticity ===

Since linear elasticity is a direct result of interatomic interaction, it is related to the extension/compression of bonds. It can then be derived from the interatomic potential for crystalline materials. First, let us examine the potential energy of two interacting atoms. Starting from very far points, they will feel an attraction towards each other. As they approach each other, their potential energy will decrease. On the other hand, when two atoms are very close to each other, their total energy will be very high due to repulsive interaction. Together, these potentials guarantee an interatomic distance that achieves a minimal energy state. This occurs at some distance r0, where the total force is zero:

:formula_27

Where U is interatomic potential and r is the interatomic distance. This means the atoms are in equilibrium.

To extend the two atoms approach into solid, consider a simple model, say, a 1-D array of one element with interatomic distance of r, and the equilibrium distance is &quot;r&quot;0. Its potential energy-interatomic distance relationship has similar form as the two atoms case, which reaches minimal at &quot;r&quot;0, The Taylor expansion for this is:

:formula_28

At equilibrium, the first derivative is 0, so the dominant term is the quadratic one. When displacement is small, the higher order terms should be omitted. The expression becomes:

:formula_29

:formula_30

Which is clearly linear elasticity.

Note that the derivation is done considering two neighboring atoms, so the Hook&#x27;s coefficient is:

:formula_31

This form can be easily extended to 3-D case, with volume per atom(Ω) in place of interatomic distance.

:formula_32

<text>Brian Thomas Burke (born 25 February 1947) is an Australian former politician who was the 23rd premier of Western Australia from 25 February 1983 to his resignation on 25 February 1988. He was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 30 March 1973 to 25 February 1988, representing the electoral districts of Balga and Balcatta at various points, and was the leader of the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia from 18 September 1981 to 25 February 1988. Burke studied law at the University of Western Australia for one year before dropping out. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he worked as a journalist for &quot;The West Australian&quot; newspaper, 6PM radio station, and Seven News Perth. He was elected to Parliament at the 1973 Balcatta state by-election, becoming one of the most popular local members over the following years. In 1981, he became the leader of the Labor Party in a leadership spill. He led the Labor Party to its first election victory since 1971 at the 1983 Western Australian state election, defeating the Liberal-National government of Ray O&#x27;Connor.

His achievements as Premier include the reopening the Fremantle railway line, abolishing capital punishment, banning nuclear power, and implementing electoral reform. He was also at the centre of the WA Inc scandal, in which his cosy relationships with entrepreneurs led the state to losing hundreds of millions of dollars. This included providing a $150 million guarantee to the Rothwells bank following the October 1987 stock market crash. A year later, Rothwells went into liquidation.

Burke resigned as Premier and as a member of Parliament exactly five years after taking office, while still having a high popularity. He was succeeded by Peter Dowding, who went on to win the 1989 state election. In June 1988, he was appointed a Companion to the Order of Australia. Burke then became the Australian Ambassador to Ireland and the Australian Ambassador to the Holy See. He resigned from those positions in 1991, having to face the WA Inc royal commission. Although not found criminally responsible for anything relating to WA Inc, the royal commission discovered that he had falsely claimed $17,000 from a parliamentary travel account between 1984 and 1986. In July 1994, he was sentenced to two years in prison, but was released on parole after having served seven months. In April 1995, he was stripped of his Order of Australia honour. In March 1997, he was found guilty of stealing $122,585 in campaign donations to the Labor Party. He was sentenced to three years jail, but served six months before the conviction was quashed on appeal.

In the 2000s and early 2010s, Burke continued to maintain his Labor party contacts and parliamentary influence, using them to further his career as a pro-business lobbyist. He worked both sides of politics in partnership with disgraced former ministerial colleague Julian Grill and assisted by former senator Noel Crichton-Browne.

== Early life and career ==
Burke was born on 25 February 1947 at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco, in the western suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. His parents were Tom Burke, an Australian Labor Party politician in the House of Representatives from 1943 to 1955, and Madeline Muirson Orr. Tom Burke had Irish ancestry, and was deeply Catholic. Madeline Orr was of Irish and Scottish ancestry. Brian Burke was the third child out of five: the first child was Terence Joseph &quot;Terry&quot; Burke, who also grew up to be a politician. He also had an older sister, a younger brother, and a younger sister. In his early years, Brian was quite independent as his parents focused on his younger brother Frank, who had down syndrome, and his father was often in Canberra. He grew up in the middle-class Perth suburb of Wembley, living in a California bungalow set on a quarter acre block. From 1952 to 1954, he was educated at Brigidine Primary School in Wembley, a Catholic school run by Irish nuns, and from 1955 to 1964, he was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Marist Brothers College in Subiaco.

Burke met his future wife Suzanne May Nevill at a school dance class when they were both 16. Several months later, they started going out, and on 11 September 1965, they married each other at St Francis Xavier&#x27;s Church in East Perth. That year, he was studying law at the University of Western Australia (UWA), but he switched to part-time study when he got a job in September 1965 as a cadet proof-reader at West Australian Newspapers Ltd. with help from his father. For the following two years, he studied economics part-time at UWA, but he dropped out completely after that. In 1967, he became a cadet journalist for &quot;The West Australian&quot;, in 1969, he worked as a journalist for the 6PM radio station, and from 1970 to 1973, he worked for Seven News Perth. Whilst at &quot;The West Australian&quot;, Burke was assigned to collect horse race results at Gloucester Park. Seeing that there was no form guide being sold, he decided to start his own, forming the &quot;Punters&#x27; Guide&quot; with a group of university Labor branch members, including John Dawkins and Kim Beazley. Some of the profits raised went to the Labor Party. At the peak of its popularity, the &quot;Punters&#x27; Guide&quot; sold 16,000 copies. Meanwhile, Burke and his wife lived &quot;on the bones of their arses&quot; for several years, moving into a State Housing Commission home in 1970 before eventually being able to put a deposit on a home in Balga, a working-class suburb north of Perth. By the age of 24, Burke had three children.

== Political beginnings ==
Burke&#x27;s brother Terry was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in 1968, representing the electoral district of Perth. In 1973, on the same day that Herb Graham, the deputy premier and member for Balcatta, announced his retirement from politics, Burke made his decision to seek Labor preselection for Balcatta. He faced an uphill battle, with state secretary Joe Chamberlain wanting Patricia Giles preselected. With the help of Terry and a particularly good performance by Burke at a preselection meeting, he became Labor&#x27;s candidate for Balcatta. As the Labor Party only had a one-seat majority, the ensuing by-election would determine whether it would remain in office. Having undertaken an opinion poll of the seat, Burke realised he was most likely not going to win, so he asked acting state secretary Kim Beazley for money to fund his campaign. Beazley gave Burke&#x27;s campaign $6,000, which was all the money in the party&#x27;s electoral account, angering Chamberlain as the money was meant for the upcoming full state election. At the ensuing by-election on 28 July 1973, Burke defeated the Liberal Party candidate by 30 votes as measured on a two-party-preferred basis. He was sworn into Parliament on 5 August 1973.

At the 1974 state election on 30 March, he was elected to the newly created seat of Balga after Balcatta was abolished. At that election, the Labor Party led by John Tonkin lost their majority, and Charles Court from the Liberal Party became premier. Burke was one of the few Labor Party politicians to increase their vote at that election. Over the following five to six years, Burke had a low profile within the party, however he built up support in his electorate, with him eventually becoming one of the most popular local members ever. He became known as the &quot;Godfather of Balga&quot;, although not in a pejorative way.

Burke would often come up with ideas for raising money for the Labor Party, including that the party start a printing press and open a Chinese restaurant. Other members of his branch would talk the ideas down. Many other people in the party would criticise Burke due to his unprofessional nature and lack of concern for policy development. He once spoke at a press conference whilst wearing a caftan. Another time, Burke suggested to Tonkin &quot;...any business person looking for a government contract—you don’t get a contract unless you kick into (contribute to) the party.&quot; He was seen as a larrikin.

Instead of being part of any Labor Party factions, Burke chose to build alliances with others in the party from either faction. He was skilled at networking and attracting people to be loyal to him. In 1977, he was convicted of drink driving, dangerous driving, and failing to stop after an accident. He was fined $390 and had his driver&#x27;s licence suspended for six months. His political career remained undamaged, and he decided to lose weight and give up alcohol.

Burke joined the shadow ministry in April 1977, being appointed by Labor leader Colin Jamieson as the shadow minister for works, water supplies, and housing. In March 1978, new Labor leader Ron Davies appointed Burke as the shadow minister for housing, and the chief secretary. From 7 March 1980, Burke was the shadow minister for water resources, housing, and consumer affairs.

In the late 1970s, Burke made several speeches opposing the Vietnamese boat people. He told the &quot;Daily News&quot; on 29 May 1978 that &quot;these Vietnamese coming here in boats were not genuine refugees&quot;. On 23 August 1978, he said to Parliament &quot;how many members of this House can say that all the refugees coming here are genuine? Can a refugee be defined as being genuine if they have the ability to commandeer a boat and come to this country?&quot; In 1980, Burke began to prominently campaign against the death penalty. He made headlines by calling for public executions in places such as Forrest Place with the cabinet members responsible for the execution to be there.

== Path to premier ==
Over the 1970s, the Labor Party failed to come close to defeating the Liberal/National Country Coalition led by Charles Court. The Coalition had an advantage due to malapportionment favouring rural areas. After the 1977 election, Burke contested the Labor Party&#x27;s deputy leadership, but was beaten by Mal Bryce by one vote. Following the 1980 election, Burke, Arthur Tonkin and Bryce began planning to remove Davies as party leader. With Tonkin never in serious leadership contention, Burke had to convince Bryce that he was the best man to lead the party. Bryce eventually came around for Burke, reasoning that Burke had better media and fundraising skills, necessary as the party was short on funds. Bryce told his followers to support Burke, who mostly went through with that. There was some trepidation however, with a few people seeing him as a risk. On 18 September 1981, Burke defeated Davies in a Labor Party leadership spill 20 votes to 11, and so he became the leader of the opposition. Bryce was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party and so he became the deputy leader of the opposition. He then appointed the Burke shadow ministry. Burke himself was appointed shadow treasurer and the shadow minister for immigration, ethnic affairs, economic affairs, federal affairs and aboriginal affairs. At 34 years old, Burke was the fourth-youngest ever opposition leader. Upon becoming leader, Burke said to Bryce, &quot;are we happy and agreed—I’m responsible for image and marketing; you’re responsible for policy and substance&quot;.

Following his ascension to the leadership of the Labor Party, Burke changed his demeanour. In an effort to remove his image as a larrikin, he asked a colleague to prepare a paper on the type of persona to show to the public. He lost weight and wore dark business suits. Burke took inspiration from populist American politician Huey Long, who had positioned himself as a champion of the poor. Beazley had given Burke a copy of &quot;Huey Long&quot;, a 1969 biography written by T. Harry Williams. Bryce said that &quot;it was simply common practice for Burke to bring the biography into Parliament. It was the most read book I had ever seen him read over a long time working closely with him.&quot; Quentin Beresford posited in his biography, &quot;The godfather: the life of Brian Burke&quot;, that Burke saw similarities between himself and Long. They both came from large families, were skilled at manipulating people, did not have any fundamental political philosophy, and were entrepreneurial.

On 25 January 1982, Court retired from Parliament, and the Liberal Party elected Ray O&#x27;Connor as its leader. Leading into the 1983 state election, Western Australia was in a recession and interest rates were rising, affecting middle-class voters who would normally vote Liberal. Burke was a strong performer in the media, and O&#x27;Connor lacked leadership on many issues. The government was seen to have lost its way, with little to no policy on social issues such as abortion, divorce, and prostitution. In December 1982, O&#x27;Connor called the election for 19 February 1983. To O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s dismay, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser set the federal election two weeks after the state election. This was seen as an advantage to the state Labor Party, as the party&#x27;s federal leader Bob Hawke, who was raised in Western Australia, was seen as more sympathetic to the state than the Liberal Prime Minister Fraser.

By mid-January, unemployment was up to 9.5%. Combatting unemployment became the main plank of Labor&#x27;s campaign, with Burke saying that his aim was to &quot;create an economic environment in which all those who sought full-time paid employment could find it&quot;. He promised during the campaign to set up a state unemployment taskforce at a cost of $34.5 million which reported to Cabinet. He also promised to reform the Legislative Council, which Labor had long criticised as undemocratic. This would include reducing the number of members from 34 to 22, which would require a referendum. Other commitments were to set up an inquiry into education conducted by former Federal Minister for Education Kim Beazley Sr., build an extra 1,500 state housing units using the funds from the sale of housing commission land, establish a Western Australian Development Bank to increase the amount of risk capital, reduce payroll tax and eventually abolish it, and set up a South East Asian Marketing Corporation to increase exports. To combat price increases, Burke promised to install a price commissioner and set a maximum limit on the price of petrol. In terms of rail transport, Burke reiterated an earlier promise to reopen the Perth to Fremantle passenger rail line, which was closed in 1979 by the Court Government as a result of poor patronage and the increasing cost to run it. The closure had attracted heavy opposition, with a petition calling for the closure to be reconsidered gaining 110,000 signatures. He also promised to electrify the line between Kwinana and Bunbury and improve passenger services between Perth and Bunbury. The main criticism the Liberal Party made of Labor&#x27;s promises was that funding was not specified in most cases, and when it was, the funding was inadequate.

The election resulted in Labor recording a two-party-preferred vote of 54.4%, winning nine additional seats in the Legislative Assembly, giving them a majority of three. With a swing of 7.48%, the scale of Labor&#x27;s victory surprised most people. Despite that, Labor won only seven out of the seventeen Legislative Council seats up for election. In his victory speech, he criticised the malapportionment of the Legislative Council.

== Premier ==
Burke and his ministry were sworn in by Governor Sir Richard Trowbridge on 25 February 1983. It was Burke&#x27;s 36th birthday, making him the third youngest premier of Western Australia. Burke&#x27;s ministry consisted of 15 men and no women. The size of his cabinet was criticised by O&#x27;Connor as hypocritical, who said that the Labor Party had criticised his own cabinet for being too large, creating extra cost. Three of the cabinet members had previously been a minister: Ron Davies and Dave Evans served in the Tonkin Ministry from 1971 to 1974 and Joe Berinson served in the Whitlam Ministry in 1975. The only member of the ministry who was not in Burke&#x27;s shadow ministry was Peter Dowding, who had only been elected three years prior. Dowding replaced Mike Barnett, who did not nominate himself for the ministry due to family reasons. Burke himself had the roles of Treasurer, Minister Coordinating Economic and Social Development, Minister for Forests, Minister for Tourism, and Minister for Women&#x27;s Interests. It was standard at the time for the premier to also be the treasurer and the minister coordinating economic and social development. This was the first time that women&#x27;s interests was a ministry, and started a trend that lasted until 1992 that the premier hold that ministry whilst an assistant minister helps with the portfolio.

A day after the election, Burke visited Fremantle to reassure residents that the line would be reopened. The line reopened on 29 July 1983, with Burke riding in the driver&#x27;s cab with Works Minister and former train driver Ken McIver driving the first passenger train back on the line. The cost of repairing the line for reopening was $800,000 and the cost of the first year of operations was $800,000.

Two weeks after the election, Burke recalled Parliament to implement the promise to reduce prices.

Just prior to the 1983 election, Burke rang businessman Laurie Connell, and convinced him to donate $25,000 to the Labor Party. The two were introduced to each other by radio presenter Bob Maumill, a colleague of Burke when he worked at Seven News. Maumill had grown quite close to Burke. Maumill, and later Howard Sattler, hosted a weekly morning radio segment on 6PR called &quot;Ask the Premier&quot;, where Burke would answer listeners&#x27; questions.

As Tourism Minister, Burke chaired the Rottnest Island Board, where he met Dallas Dempster, an appointee by the previous Liberal government. When Burke won government, Dempster offered his resignation from the board, but Burke declined the offer. Burke later chose Dempster to become chairman of the board.

Early in his term as premier, Burke was approached by the developers of the Argyle diamond mine. They claimed to have an agreement with the O&#x27;Connor Government that their obligation to build a town at the mine would be waived if the coalition had won the 1983 election. Burke decided to allow the waiver to go ahead, provided that the government be compensated by $58 million. The government then spent $42 million to buy a 5% stake in the mine from Northern Mining, a company owned by Alan Bond. Burke later said &quot;that showed me it (revenue raising) could be done. Bryce later said he saw the deal as the introduction of fly-in fly-out in Australia, saying that &quot;the social implications [of the deal] are pretty ugly&quot;. Burke then held a meeting with several federal government MPs, including John Dawkins, Kim Beasley and Peter Walsh, where he pitched the idea of becoming a state capitalist to help with the state&#x27;s financial situation. It was later revealed in the WA Inc royal commission that Connell was a paid advisor to both Burke and Bond during the deal&#x27;s negotiations. The royal commission found that Burke had known about Connell advising Bond, but &quot;deliberately chose not to tell his Cabinet colleagues. Such conduct is grossly improper&quot;.

In June 1983, Burke announced a number of measures to improve Western Australia&#x27;s finances. Gas and electricity prices were increased on average by 15%, water increased by 7.9%, housing commission rents rose 10%, bus fares increased by 5%, rail and road coach fares rose 10% and hospital bed charges rose between 11.5% and 19%. These cost increases were expected to gain the government $60 million for the upcoming budget. He also announced pay cuts for senior public servants, politicians, and the judiciary, and that 1,000 government jobs would be removed, saving $15 million. The tribunals that usually set salaries were bypassed as these changes were done via an Act of Parliament. Although the public service union described this as &quot;lunacy&quot;, the general public approved of the pay cuts, which overshadowed the cost increases. A Morgan Gallup poll taken as Burke announced the charge increases and salary cuts showed Burke to be Australia&#x27;s most popular premier at the time, with an approval rating of 72%.

He appointed Gordon Reid as governor in 1984, refusing an offer from Trowbridge, who was English, to extend his term.

He started a three-year anti smoking campaign which cost $6 million as well as proposing to raise $32 million a year from a tobacco licence fee. He also considered a ban on the advertising of tobacco products.

As Minister for Women&#x27;s Interests, Burke announced in August 1983 that he would set up a Women&#x27;s Advisory Council and introduce anti-sex discrimination legislation to Parliament. The following month, the advisory council was set up, with 20 appointees there advising Cabinet on all policy decisions affecting women.

In September 1983, the Royal Perth Yacht Club won the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup in the first successful challenge of the New York Yacht Club&#x27;s 132-year defence of the Cup. He predicted that the 1987 defence of the Cup would necessitate a $500 million investment in Western Australia and an additional 400,000 to 500,000 tourists.

In December 1983, Burke reshuffled his ministry, making Berinson the minister for budget management, taking some workload off Burke&#x27;s role as treasurer. By the end of 1983, Burke had established the Small Business Development Corporation, the Western Australian Institute of Sport, the Tripartite Labour Consultative Council to recommend legislation and reform for industrial relations, and the Multi-Cultural and Ethnic Affairs Commission.

In February 1984, Bill Hassell became the leader of the opposition, succeeding O&#x27;Connor.

In 1987, Cabinet gave approval for the electrification of the Fremantle, Armadale and Midland lines.

=== Daylight saving ===
The Burke Government passed legislation for a one-year trial of daylight saving over the summer of 1983–4. Following this, the 1984 daylight saving referendum occurred on 7 April 1984, at which the majority voted against making daylight saving permanent.

=== Capital punishment ===
As Premier, Burke pushed for the abolition of capital punishment. Western Australia was the second last state in which capital punishment was legal, with the last person executed being Eric Edgar Cooke in 1964. Since then, the death penalty had been commuted 23 times. On 13 June 1983, cabinet approved legislation to abolish capital punishment, and in 1984, Parliament passed the legislation. Burke later called this his &quot;proudest achievement&quot;.

=== Aboriginal land rights ===
It was proposed at Labor&#x27;s 1984 national conference that Aboriginal land rights be made uniform nationally. This included the right for Aboriginal people to &quot;refuse permission for mining on their land or to impose conditions under which mining may proceed&quot;. Burke appointed Paul Seaman QC to conduct an inquiry into the issue. Seaman&#x27;s report, released in September 1984, backed the concept of refusing permission for mining as well as proposing that an Aboriginal Lands Tribunal have the power to rule on land and compensation claims. Burke opposed these proposals, saying that the government should rule on land and compensation claims. Burke and Prime Minister Hawke eventually came to an agreement in October 1985 such that the federal government&#x27;s legislation would not allow Aboriginal people to veto mining proposals on their lands. The state government introduced its own legislation on Aboriginal land rights in March 1985, but although Burke lobbied Opposition Leader Hassell to support the legislation, it was defeated in the Legislative Council. Burke told Hassell that if the opposition does not support the legislation, then the federal government would introduce stronger legislation. In August 1985, Federal Cabinet approved stronger legislation. Burke threatened to take the proposed legislation to the High Court, but after the 1986 state election in February that year, the federal government abandoned any plans for uniform national legislation, and accepted Western Australia&#x27;s proposal for 99-year leases for existing Aboriginal reserves.

=== Burswood Casino ===


In 1984, Burke told Dallas Dempster that the government would call for expressions of interest for a casino to be built in Perth. Dempster then worked with Malaysian casino operator Genting to put together an application to build a casino on an old landfill in Burswood. The government chose the Burswood site as a result of Dempster, and competitors had to prepare bids for that site. The Dempster and Genting bid won out, sparking accusations of favouritism from rival bidders.

=== 1986 state election ===
Labor won the 1986 state election with 53% of the primary vote. The government lost three ministers: Ken McIver, who lost his seat, and Ron Davies and Dave Evans, who both retired. Burke chose to expand his ministry by two, leading to five new ministers. They were Ernie Bridge, who was Australia&#x27;s first Aboriginal minister, Pam Beggs and Kay Hallahan, who were the WA Labor Party&#x27;s first female ministers, and Ian Taylor and Gavan Troy.

=== Electoral reform ===
By the end of 1983, the Burke Government was yet to get the electoral reform legislation through the Legislative Council. It had spent $50,000 on an advertising campaign in an attempt to get public support for a referendum on the issue.

Burke&#x27;s government enacted important electoral reforms in 1987, introducing multi-member electorates in the Legislative Council and a method of proportional representation &#x27;weighted&#x27; to give extra representation to rural constituents (but ending excessive and unfair rural weighting which had been in effect for many years). Four-year maximum terms were established for the Legislative Assembly, and fixed four-year terms for the Legislative Council.

=== Rothwells ===
Rothwells was a merchant bank managed by Connell. He was the chairman and chief executive officer, and owned over a thirty percent stake in the company. Many of the bank&#x27;s deposits were by community organisations, local councils, charities, and churches in Western Australia. In October 1987, the stock market crashed. Depositors worried about their deposit&#x27;s safety began withdrawing funds. By 24 October, twenty-seven percent of Rothwell&#x27;s funds had been withdrawn. Much of the run came from stockbroking firms retrieving funds they had deposited for clients. Unlike many other merchant banks, Rothwells did not have a major financial institution as its parent. It had to draw on lines of credit it had with other banks.

Rothwells would need $300 million in cash if all deposits were withdrawn. Over the weekend of 24 and 25 October, a rescue package was put together to save Rothwells from bankruptcy. A group of businessmen and companies, including Kerry Packer, Alan Bond, Robert Holmes a Court, Ron Brierley, and Dallas Dempster, committed $164 million in equity under the proviso that the Western Australian Government provide a guarantee for $150 million. $70 million of that was provided by Connell alone. Burke agreed to provide the guarantee under the conditions that equity was provided by the aforementioned businessmen and companies, that the government&#x27;s guarantee rank last to reduce the chance that it be drawn from, that Robert Holmes a Court commit equity, that Connell commit all his wealth, that the government get a director on Rothwells&#x27; board, that a high fee be charged for the facility provided, and that the Liberal Party support the proposal. The government expected to have to pay out no money to Rothwells. Opposition Leader Barry MacKinnon said that the Liberal Party would not support the proposal but not oppose it either. The proposal went ahead anyway, with Burke announcing it to the public on 25 October. A year later, Rothwells went into liquidation. It later emerged that the two largest debtors were companies owned by Laurie Connell.

== Resignation ==
Upon becoming premier, Burke promised to resign after five years. Upon his 1986 election victory, he told his ministry &quot;I&#x27;ll be leaving in two years&quot;, although most could not tell if he was serious. In public, he would say that he intended to lead Labor through the next election, but leading up to the end of 1987, speculation that he would resign increased.

In December 1987, Burke announced his intention to resign as premier and from Parliament on 25 February 1988. Dowding was the most likely candidate to replace him, with Burke picking Dowding as his preferred successor. A secret opinion poll conducted by the Labor Party in March 1987 found that Dowding was the most &quot;electorally acceptable&quot; candidate, however certain trade unions and sections of the Labor Party disliked Dowding. Other contenders were David Parker, Bob Pearce, and Julian Grill, however they all pulled out of contention before the 30 December Labor caucus vote due to Burke&#x27;s influence, the opinion poll, and the need for the party to be united. Dowding was unanimously elected as the leader of the Labor Party, and Parker was unanimously elected as deputy leader, replacing Mal Bryce, who had also announced his intention to resign.

Burke then accepted an appointment as Australia&#x27;s ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. In the 1988 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion to the Order of Australia.

== Downfall ==
In April 1991, Burke appeared before the WA Inc royal commission. The royal commission&#x27;s report, released on 19 October 1992, was critical of Burke but did not consider his behaviour illegal. The report stated:

However, another report found that he had falsely claimed $17,000 worth of travel expenses. In 1992, Burke was charged with five counts of defrauding the state by making false claims on the parliamentary imprest account. He was accused of claiming money from the account on five separate occasions despite those trips having been already paid for by another account. Burke&#x27;s defence was that his staff had done so unwittingly and that he had no knowledge of it. One of the charges was later dropped. On 13 July 1994, Burke was found guilty on all four counts of fraud. The maximum sentence he faced was three years jail for each count. He was released on bail for $25,000. Two days later, he was sentenced to two years in prison. He was released on parole after seven months.

In April 1995, he was stripped of his Order of Australia honour.

In March 1997, he was found guilty of stealing $122,585 in campaign donations to the Labor Party to fund his stamp collection. He was sentenced to three years jail, but served six months before the conviction was quashed on appeal.

== Lobbying activities ==
Burke became active as a consultant and lobbyist for Western Australian business interests. His continued involvement in state Labor branch politics was the subject of controversy since before Labor returned to power in 2001. As premier, Geoff Gallop banned cabinet ministers from contact with Burke, but this was lifted by his successor Alan Carpenter when he took office in February 2006.

On 9 November 2006, Burke resigned from the Labor Party after public criticism from Carpenter, in part due to evidence provided to the Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC). Norm Marlborough, the Minister for Small Business and the South-West in the Carpenter Ministry, was forced to resign from the ministry and from the Parliament on 10 November 2006 after the Corruption and Crime Commission revealed he had kept a &quot;secret mobile phone&quot; to stay in touch with Burke.

This triggered a by-election for Marlborough&#x27;s seat of Peel, although Labor retained the seat. Burke subsequently stood trial on five charges of telling lies to the CCC inquiry and on 1 April 2010 was found guilty of deliberately giving false testimony and fined $25,000. An attempted appeal to the High Court against the conviction failed. Soon after, Burke was found not guilty of a separate charge of disclosing official secrets.

On 19 June 2013, Burke was charged with four counts of insider trading relating to the ASX-listed telecommunications company AMCOM, all of which were dropped on 18 February 2014.

Since retiring as a lobbyist in 2006, Burke has worked with his son Peter as a property developer.

== Personal life ==
Burke and his wife have four sons and two daughters.

In 1984, Burke stated &quot;I leave the church going to my wife. I run the country.&quot; In 1986, when asked &quot;Are you a practising Catholic?&quot;, he replied &quot;no, I am not a practising Catholic... I suppose I am partly a practising Catholic.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Burke has had several books written about him. Patrick O&#x27;Brien, the senior lecturer in politics at the University of Western Australia, released &quot;The Burke Ambush: Corporatism and Society in Western Australia&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Shambles: Parliamentary Contempt in the Wild West&quot; alongside Anthony McAdam in 1987. In 1988, John Hamilton released &quot;Burkie: A biography of Brian Burke&quot; with the cooperation of Burke. In 2008, Edith Cowan University Professor Quentin Beresford released &quot;The Godfather: The life of Brian Burke&quot;, an unauthorised biography. In 2017, Burke released an autobiography titled &quot;A tumultuous life&quot;. There is also Brian Peachy&#x27;s &quot;The Burkes of Western Australia&quot;, which was released in 1992 and is about Burke&#x27;s father and his family. In 2008, &quot;Business News&quot;&#x27;s Joseph Poprzeczny said that Burke was the most written about premier in Western Australian history.

<doc id="1092116" wikidata="Q1667595" url="?curid=1092116" title="International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes">
<text>The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (also known as the WHO Code) is an international health policy framework for breastfeeding promotion adopted by the World Health Assembly (WHA) of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1981. The Code was developed as a global public health strategy and recommends restrictions on the marketing of breast milk substitutes, such as infant formula, to ensure that mothers are not discouraged from breastfeeding and that substitutes are used safely if needed. The Code also covers ethical considerations and regulations for the marketing of feeding bottles and teats. A number of subsequent WHA resolutions have further clarified or extended certain provisions of the Code.

Since 1981, 84 countries have enacted legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code and subsequent relevant WHA resolutions.

==Provisions==
The Code aims to shield breastfeeding from commercial promotion that affects mothers, health workers and health care systems. The Code and resolutions also contain specific provisions and recommendations relating to labelling of infant formula and other breastmilk substitutes.

;i. Mothers

* Information and educational materials on infant and young child feeding should be objective and consistent and emphasize the importance of breastfeeding. In no case should such materials refer to a brand name of a product.
* All forms of product advertising and promotion are prohibited.
* Mothers should not be given free product samples.
* Promotional devices such as discounts and special displays at the retail level are prohibited.
* Company representatives may not initiate direct or indirect contact with mothers.
* Health risks to infants who are artificially fed or who are not exclusively breastfed should be highlighted through appropriate labeling and warnings.

;ii. Health workers

* The Code gives health workers the responsibility to encourage and protect breastfeeding.
* Materials regarding products given to health professionals by manufacturers and distributors should be limited to ‘scientific and factual’ matters. They should not be tools to promote the use of products.
* Product samples may be given only when necessary for professional evaluation or research at the institutional level. In no case should these samples be passed on to mothers.
* In order to prevent conflicts of interest, manufacturers and distributors should not give material or financial inducements to health workers. Three WHA resolutions on infant and young child nutrition subsequent to the adoption of the Code specifically cautioned against conflicts of interest. A 1996 resolution (WHA resolution 49.15) called for caution in accepting financial support for health professionals working in infant and young child health which may create conflicts of interest. The need to avoid conflicts of interest was expanded in 2005 (WHA resolution 58.32) to cover programmes in infant and young child health and reiterated in 2008 (WHA resolution 61.20).

;iii. Health care systems

* Promotion of any product is forbidden in a health care facility. This includes the display of products, placards and posters concerning such products and distribution of materials provided by manufacturers and distributors.
* Formula feeding should be demonstrated only to those mothers or family members who need to use it and the information given should include a clear explanation of the risks of formula feeding and hazards of improper use of products.
* Donated equipment and materials should not refer to brand names of products.
* Free Supplies: Two subsequent resolutions (WHA 39.28 [1986] and WHA 47.5 [1994]) effectively call for an end to all free or low-cost supplies to any part of the health care system. Manufacturers and distributors are therefore prohibited from providing products to health care facilities for free or at low cost. (According to guidelines under the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, ‘low cost’ means less than 80% of the retail price.)

;iv. Labelling

* Information on labels for infant formula must be in simple and easy to understand terms in an appropriate language. 
* Labels of infant formula must contain a statement on the superiority of breastfeeding and that the product should only be used after consultation with health professionals.
* Pictures or text which may idealize the use of infant formula and certain wordings, such as &#x27;humanized” or “materialized” or similar terms should not be used.
* Nutrition and health claims on labels for breastmilk substitutes should not be permitted unless allowed by national legislation (WHA resolution 58.32 [2005]).
* Labels must contain explicit warnings on labels to inform consumers about the risks of contamination of powdered formula with pathogenic microorganisms (WHA resolution 58.32 [2005]). 
* Labels must conform with WHO/FAO guidelines on safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formula (WHA resolution 61.20 [2008]).

In line with the recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding in WHA resolution 54.2 [2001], all complementary foods must be labeled as suitable for use by infants from six months and not earlier.

==Implementation==

The baby food industry has been the subject of pointed criticism from non-governmental organizations, international agencies and campaign groups for failing to abide by the Code. One of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, the Swiss giant Nestlé, has been the subject of an international boycott campaign since 1977 for its milk-substitute marketing practices prior to and since the development of the Code (see Nestlé boycott).

On its own, the International Code is not legally enforceable. Companies are only subject to legal sanctions for failing to abide by the Code where it has been incorporated into the legislature of a nation state. Many countries have fully or partially adopted the Code as law. Other countries have no legislation on baby food marketing at all.

Code violations by baby food manufacturers are still widespread, especially (but not exclusively) in countries that have not implemented the Code as a national measure or where monitoring and enforcement is weak. The WHO, International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), UNICEF, Save the Children, Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) and other international organizations perform monitoring of implementation of the Code across the world both independently and with governments.

<doc id="1092120" wikidata="Q2561570" url="?curid=1092120" title="Remote direct memory access">
<text>In computing, remote direct memory access (RDMA) is a direct memory access from the memory of one computer into that of another without involving either one&#x27;s operating system. This permits high-throughput, low-latency networking, which is especially useful in massively parallel computer clusters.

== Overview ==
RDMA supports zero-copy networking by enabling the network adapter to transfer data from the wire directly to application memory or from application memory directly to the wire, eliminating the need to copy data between application memory and the data buffers in the operating system. Such transfers require no work to be done by CPUs, caches, or context switches, and transfers continue in parallel with other system operations. This reduces latency in message transfer.

However, this strategy presents several problems related to the fact that the target node is not notified of the completion of the request (single-sided communications).

== Acceptance ==
As of 2018 RDMA had achieved broader acceptance as a result of implementation enhancements that enable good performance over ordinary networking infrastructure. For example RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) now is able to run over either lossy or lossless infrastructure. In addition iWARP enables an Ethernet RDMA implementation at the physical layer using TCP/IP as the transport, combining the performance and latency advantages of RDMA with a low-cost, standards-based solution. The RDMA Consortium and the DAT Collaborative have played key roles in the development of RDMA protocols and APIs for consideration by standards groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Interconnect Software Consortium.

Hardware vendors have started working on higher-capacity RDMA-based network adapters, with rates of 100 Gbit/s reported. Software vendors, such as IBM, Red Hat and Oracle Corporation, support these APIs in their latest products, and engineers have started developing network adapters that implement RDMA over Ethernet. 
Both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise MRG have support for RDMA. Microsoft supports RDMA in Windows Server 2012 via SMB Direct. VMware ESXi also supports RDMA as of 2015.

Common RDMA implementations include the Virtual Interface Architecture, RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), InfiniBand, Omni-Path and iWARP.

== Using RDMA ==
Applications access control structures using well-defined APIs originally designed for the InfiniBand Protocol (although the APIs can be used for any of the underlying RDMA implementations). Using send and completion queues, applications perform RDMA operations by submitting work queue entries (WQEs) into the submission queue (SQ) and getting notified of responses from the completion queue (CQ). 

== Transport types ==
RDMA can transport data reliably or unreliably over the Reliably Connected (RC) and Unreliable Datagram (UD) transport protocols, respectively. The former has the benefit of preserving requests (no requests are lost), while the latter requires fewer queue pairs when handling multiple connections. This is due to the fact that UD is connection-less, allowing a single host to communicate with any other using a single queue.

<doc id="1092122" wikidata="Q2569160" url="?curid=1092122" title="Hedon">
<text>Hedon is a town and civil parish in Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated approximately east of Hull city centre. It lies to the north of the A1033 road at the crossroads of the B1240 and B1362 roads.
It is particularly noted for the parish church of St. Augustine, known as the &#x27;King of Holderness&#x27;, which is a Grade I listed building.

In 1991, the town had a population of 6,066, which had risen to 6,332 by the time of the 2001 UK census. By the 2011 UK census, Hedon parish had a population of 7,100,

==History==

Hedon is not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; which leads to the belief that it was a new town created by the Normans as a port. Hedon was at its most prosperous in the 12th and 13th centuries and at one time was the 11th largest port in England. The decline of the port came with the development of the port of Hull and the building of larger ships which were unable to get up the small river to Hedon.

Hedon was given its first charter by Henry II in 1158 and was granted improved ones by King John in 1200 and Henry III in 1248 and 1272. Edward III granted the most important charter which gave the town the right to elect a mayor.

In 1415 Hedon was granted an important charter, which let the town have burgesses and other ministers and also gave the town a mace. This mace, held in Hedon Town Hall, is now the oldest surviving mace in the country, and is clearly a weapon of war.

The town was a parliamentary borough until it was disenfranchised under the Reform Act 1832. It still enjoyed its borough status granted by its charters until 1974 when it was removed in a reorganisation of local government.

To the west of the town, on the Twyers Estate, was a racecourse. The course staged its first meeting on 24 August 1888, with Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale in attendance on the second day, and racing continued until 1895. The racecourse was re-opened in 1906 but closed permanently after racing on 11 September 1909. After closing it was developed into an aerodrome officially opened in 1929 by Prince George, Duke of Kent. It was the arrival point of Hull-born aviator Amy Johnson on her record-breaking solo flight to Australia in 1930, where she began a triumphant homecoming. After ten years of operation, the aerodrome closed during Second World War, 1939–1945. Afterward, the site was briefly used as a motorcycle speedway track. Attempts were made in the late-1950s to reopen it for flying, which failed, and the land has been used as grazing for cattle. A plaque commemorating the memory of the airfield was installed at the nearby Kingstown Hotel in July 2017.

The Hull and Holderness Railway opened in 1854 which ran from Victoria Dock in Hull to Withernsea, through Hedon. The station was built to the north of the town and it proved a vital part of Hedon&#x27;s transport system for a century. In 1965 Hedon lost its passenger service when British Railways appointed Lord Beeching to stop losses, and closed branch lines not making a profit. The line from Hull as far as Hedon remained open for goods until 1968.

Hedon became the subject of national media attention in August 2000 when a freak mini-tornado in the Humber Estuary caused flash floods and hailstones to drop on parts of the town.

Hedon was also affected by the widespread floods that occurred in the UK in the summer of 2007; areas affected included the Inmans / Westlands Estates and most areas near the Burstwick drain. A nearby village, Burstwick, saw the most homes flooded in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

There have been plans to create a country park around the Hedon Haven, south of the town. There is an open-air concrete skate park in the south of the town between Draper&#x27;s Lane and the Burstwick Drain.

==Controversy==
In late 2023, following a growing pattern in East Yorkshire by communication providers intending to provide their own services via their own individual infrastructure, wooden poles to provide internet connections to Hedon were erected on behalf of MS3 Networks. Changes to the law from April 2022 meant planning consent was not needed. 

In early 2024, some poles were identified by Historic England to be in violation of the required scheduled monument consent, a criminal offence, as the area was considered to have Scheduled Monument status. MS3 Networks&#x27; CEO stated their services could save residents &quot;...more than £1m per year&quot;. Previously in late 2023, MS3 poles in the Longhill area of Hull were felled by unknown members of the public, after protests by residents unhappy with the new poles.

==Notable people==
*Dorothy Marion Campbell, English potter
*Sir Alexander Campbell, Canadian statesman and politician, and a father of Canadian Confederation
*Mezzo-soprano singer Amy Black (1973–2009) was born and educated in Hedon and is now buried in the cemetery

<doc id="1092125" wikidata="Q1380078" url="?curid=1092125" title="Aphthona flava">
<text>Aphthona flava is a beetle of the genus &quot;Aphthona&quot;. It is native to Eurasia, and has been introduced into North America as a biocontrol agent for leafy spurge. Adults are brown and difficult to distinguish in the field from &quot;A. cyparissiae&quot; and &quot;A. nigriscutis&quot;. &quot;A. flava&quot; is still the dominant beetle at some Manitoba release sites, but it is relatively scarce in North Dakota and Minnesota. Besides Manitoba, it is widespread in Hungary and Italy.

==Ecology==

===Larvae===
The larvae are active from July to early spring of next year. When they are young, they feed on the hairs of the roots. As soon as they grow up they become bigger and start eating bigger roots. The larvae size is tiny, and are of white colour and are worm-like.

===Pupa===
Starting from late spring to early summer the pupa stage begins in the soil.

===Adult===
From June to through early fall, if the temperature is right, the adults will come out. They look like flea beetles, and behave like ones too. Their size is 3.4 mm for males, and 3.6 mm for females.

<doc id="1092133" wikidata="Q5257529" url="?curid=1092133" title="Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)">
<text>Denis Smith (born 19 November 1947) is an English former professional footballer and manager. He made 531 appearances in all competitions in 15 seasons as a player in the Football League, and as a manager, he took charge of 1,195 competitive matches.

Born in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, he joined local club Stoke City as an amateur in 1964, making his first-team debut in September 1968. A hard-tackling defender, he soon established himself in the first team, playing in a centre-back partnership with Alan Bloor for much of his career. Stoke enjoyed one of the most successful periods of their history during his time at the club, as he helped Stoke to win the League Cup in 1972, featuring in successive FA Cup semi-finals in 1971 and 1972 and helping the club to successive fifth-place finishes in the First Division in 1973–74 and 1974–75. His bravery as a player meant that he also entered the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the most injured man in football. However, he was never able to fully recover after breaking his leg for the fifth time in his career in March 1975. He did manage to continue to play competitive football and helped Stoke to win promotion from the Second Division in 1978–79. He missed the entire 1980–81 season due to injury and left the club in May 1982.

He began his management career at York City in May 1982, having played for the club on loan the previous season. He led the club to the Fourth Division title in 1983–84, totalling five seasons. He took charge of Sunderland in May 1987, and took the club to the Third Division title in 1987–88, before getting the club promoted from the Second Division in 1989–90. Dismissed by Sunderland in December 1991, he took charge at Bristol City three months later. He steered the club away from relegation in 1992–93 but was dismissed in January 1993 after falling out with the club&#x27;s directors. He was appointed manager of Oxford United in September 1993 and, although unable to avoid relegation in 1993–94, led the club to promotion from the Second Division in 1995–96. He switched clubs to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, remaining in charge for two-and-a-half seasons before being dismissed in July 1999.

He returned to manage Oxford in February 2000 and helped them to avoid relegation in 1999–2000 before resigning in October 2000. In October 2001, he was appointed manager of Wrexham, who were relegated in 2001–02. He won promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 2002–03. Wrexham entered administration in December 2004, and the resulting points deduction saw them relegated once more. Despite the financial problems, he managed the club to the Football League Trophy title in 2005, in addition to two successive FAW Premier Cup wins in 2002 and 2003. He was dismissed in January 2007, months after the club exited administration. He married in October 1967 and has three children.

==Early life==
Denis Smith was born in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, the second youngest of seven siblings. At just three years old, he formed his own gang, stating in his autobiography that &quot;if we wanted to play in the sandpit we played in the sandpit&quot;, and continued to lead his gang through junior and senior years at Sandon Road Junior School. Despite being involved with gangs since his early childhood he grew out of the culture by the age of ten, and as a teenager, formed friendships outside of his local council estate. He turned down the chance to sit the eleven plus exam as local grammar school Longton High was a rugby-playing school, and so instead attended Queensbury Road School, with whom he won the Stoke Schools Trophy; he also played for the Stoke-on-Trent Schoolboys (who were coached by former England international Dennis Wilshaw). At the age of 15 he became Staffordshire County boxing champion.

He was only at 14, but a late growth spurt took him to just under six feet and was, therefore, tall enough to play centre-back as a professional footballer. He was offered an apprenticeship by Portsmouth but turned it down as he wanted to sign for his local club Stoke City, who initially were not willing to take him on as an apprentice. They only allowed him to train with the &#x27;A&#x27; team twice a week as an amateur whilst he initially worked as a plumber&#x27;s mate, and later as a factory worker at Stone Lotus.

==Playing career==
===Stoke City===
Smith signed for Stoke City in September 1966 after telling manager Tony Waddington that he was going to sign a contract at another club; though Waddington was not keen on Smith&#x27;s hard-tackling style, he did not want to lose the young player. At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United&#x27;s FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period, Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968. He was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance, he gave away two penalties in a 3–1 defeat away to Ipswich Town and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5–1 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man-mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 1968–69 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name and was occasionally used as an emergency striker.

Smith established himself in the Stoke defence in 1969–70, forming a centre-back partnership with Alan Bloor in between full backs Jackie Marsh and Mike Pejic. Smith was the aggressive and highly physical defender, complemented by Bloor who tended to stay further back and use his intelligence to read the game and clean up any mistakes Smith made. Smith claimed his first goal for the club on 17 September 1969, in a 3–1 win over West Bromwich Albion (West Brom) at the Hawthorns. Stoke reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1970–71, and Smith played in the fourth round victory over Huddersfield Town despite suffering from a fractured ankle. He scored the only goal of the match in the fifth-round replay away to Ipswich. He also scored a &quot;freak goal&quot; from a deflected Peter Storey clearance in the semi-final against Arsenal on 27 March 1971, but Stoke lost the replay four days later.

Stoke reached the FA Cup semi-final for a second successive season in 1971–72, again being knocked out by Arsenal in a replay. He had scored in the quarter-final victory over Manchester United and pressured Arsenal&#x27;s Peter Simpson into scoring an own goal in the original semi-final match. However, John Radford was the hero of the tie as he played as an emergency goalkeeper in the first match following an injury to Bob Wilson, and then scored the winning goal in the replay. Stoke found greater success in the League Cup, beating Southport, Oxford United (after a replay), Manchester United (after two replays), Bristol Rovers and West Ham United (after three replays) to reach the 1972 League Cup Final against Chelsea. He scored two goals during the run but was knocked out whilst scoring against Bristol Rovers in the quarter-final and missed some weeks with concussion. He returned to play in the final, man-marking Peter Osgood in a match which Stoke won 2–1 to win their first major trophy.

Despite the cup success and arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th-place finish in 1972–73. Smith blamed the car crash and subsequent injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 as the cause for the club&#x27;s mid-season slump, which compounded an already poor start to the season. Any concerns over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 1973–74, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club&#x27;s fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in the last nine matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent&#x27;s 29-match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a £250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer.

Stoke made a push for the title in 1974–75. They also competed in the UEFA Cup against Dutch team Ajax, and Smith scored in a 1–1 draw at the Victoria Ground. However, Stoke would lose the tie on away goals. Smith scored the only goal of the match against Leicester City on 30 November 1974 to take Stoke top of the table. However, Smith broke his leg for the fifth time in his career making a red-card challenge on Mick Lambert in a 2–1 defeat to Ipswich on 18 March 1975; he was the fourth Stoke player to break a leg that season. Stoke ended the season again in fifth place, picking up just two points from their final three matches to finish four points behind champions Derby County.

He underwent an operation to remove cartilage in his knee in November 1975, and his recovery was not entirely successful. He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at &quot;half pace&quot;. His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground&#x27;s Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976–77. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978–79 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were &quot;boring&quot;, as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him.

A pre-season injury kept him out of the entire 1980–81 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre-back. Smith returned from injury in 1981–82, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were in 18th place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one-month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 3–1 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 4–2 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence; he commented that &quot;They had been crying out for an older head like me&quot;. He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re-established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he would have stayed, but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre-back.

===Style of play===
During Smith&#x27;s 14 seasons with Stoke, he became known for his fearless mentality, which led to him sustaining many injuries. These included five broken legs, breaking his nose four times, a cracked ankle, a broken collar bone, a chipped spine, breaking most of his fingers and toes and needing more than 200 stitches. The sequence saw him named in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the most injured man in football. Early into his career, Smith soon developed a reputation as a &quot;hard player&quot; who would launch himself at opponents determined to either block a shot or win the ball, which is how he picked up most of his injuries. He was known as Stoke&#x27;s &quot;hitman&quot;, and relished going toe to toe with the biggest and most feared opposition players.

He would generally man-mark the opposition&#x27;s playmaker or major goalscoring threat. He was a highly effective tackler, able to either flatten opposition players or quickly take the ball off their toes. After the tackle from behind was outlawed, he adapted to the rule change by making hard challenges from the side. Manager Tony Waddington said, &quot;His qualities were his tackling strength and his courage. On the ball, he just did what he could do, but he also had a tremendous ability to read the game.&quot;

==Managerial career==
===York City===
He moved into management with York as player-manager ahead of 1982–83, accepting the position on 12 May 1982. He described the set-up at Bootham Crescent on his arrival as a &quot;shambles&quot;, as training consisted entirely of running and was devoid of any actual coaching. He signed veteran players Roger Jones (goalkeeper), Alan Hay (defender) and Ricky Sbragia (defender), as well as young Stoke defender Chris Evans, which including Smith himself meant a complete change in the club&#x27;s back line. He brought in striker Viv Busby as a player-coach. He then made 26-year-old striker Keith Walwyn his priority and encouraged Walwyn to use his natural physical presence to become a greater threat in front of goal and unlock his potential. Smith retired from playing after steering York to a seventh-place in 1982–83, in which he made 36 appearances and scored 4 goals. He signed Sheffield United&#x27;s John MacPhail on a free transfer as a replacement for himself.

In his second season as York manager, 1983–84, he signed another former teammate, energetic midfielder Sean Haslegrave. Smith was named as the division&#x27;s Manager of the Month for March 1984 after York won five and drew one of their six league matches. He guided York to the Fourth Division title and promotion into the Third Division, with Walwyn scoring 25 goals and earning a place in the PFA Team of the Year alongside strike partner John Byrne, who scored 27 goals. York finished with 101 points, 16 points ahead of runners-up Doncaster Rovers.

Early in 1984–85, York were beaten by Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in the League Cup, but Byrne impressed QPR manager Alan Mullery enough to earn a £100,000 move to Loftus Road. Smith spent half of this sum (a club record) on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, who went on to score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard&#x27;s form. York started the season well, and another of his signings, Keith Houchen (£15,000), scored a hat-trick in a 7–1 win over Gillingham in November 1984. On 26 January 1985, he guided York to victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round. In the next round York came from behind to draw 1–1 at home with Liverpool, before losing 7–0 away at Anfield.

York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round in 1985–86 and took the lead through Gary Ford only to concede a stoppage-time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succumbed to a 3–1 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986, he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for £15,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed when he first came to the club were coming to the end of their careers. The 1986–87 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did, though manage to beat Chelsea 1–0 in the League Cup but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3–0. Smith ended up falling out with the club&#x27;s directors, who invested money in the club&#x27;s facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes.

===Sunderland===
In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than £20,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay £10,000. Smith agreed to a £40,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra £10,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for £275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for £80,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987–88. A 7–0 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points.

Injuries to Kay and Lemon hindered Sunderland at the start of 1988–89, and they took until 1 October 1988 to register their first win back in the Second Division. He signed burly striker Billy Whitehurst to act as a &quot;battering-ram&quot;, who proved to be an effective player despite being a heavy binge drinker. He spent a club record £500,000 on goalkeeper Tony Norman, though Hesford and Whitehurst were traded as part-exchange on the fee. Sunderland improved and ended the season in 11th-place.

He signed experienced midfielder Paul Bracewell for 1989–90 and spent £130,000 on Portsmouth left-back Paul Hardyman. He introduced the exceptionally talented teenage winger Kieron Brady to the first team. Still, he could not discipline the precocious teenager, and Brady never realised his full potential. Sunderland reached the play-offs, and faced rivals Newcastle United in the semi-final, securing passage into the final with a 2–0 victory at St James&#x27; Park. They lost 1–0 to Swindon Town in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. However, Swindon were found guilty of financial irregularities and remained in the Second Division, whilst Sunderland took their place in the First Division.

Having been promoted weeks after the end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took forward Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town&#x27;s result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.

In the summer of 1991, Stoke chairman Peter Coates offered Smith the vacant management position at the club. Smith decided that potentially being dismissed by his hometown club would be too intense an emotional experience, and he chose to stay loyal to Sunderland. This was despite finances being tight at Sunderland as the club saved the money to build a new stadium. However, after just 4 wins in the opening 14 matches of 1991–92, Smith decided to sell star striker Gabbiadini to Crystal Palace for £1.8 million to raise funds to improve the squad. He then spent £350,000 on Celtic left-back Anton Rogan and brought in strikers Don Goodman (£900,000 from West Bromwich Albion) and John Byrne (£225,000 from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion). Smith was dismissed on 30 December 1991, with Sunderland lying 17th in the Second Division. His former assistant Malcolm Crosby took Sunderland to the 1992 FA Cup Final, in which Liverpool beat them.

===Bristol City===
Smith was only out of work for nine weeks before being appointed manager of Bristol City on 9 March 1992. He succeeded Jimmy Lumsden, who left the club second-from-bottom in the Second Division. Smith felt the team lacked pace, so signed 20-year-old striker Andy Cole on loan from Arsenal. Dariusz Dziekanowski scored both goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) in Smith&#x27;s second match in charge to provide City with their first win in three months. They then won 3–1 against Smith&#x27;s former club Sunderland, with Cole scoring the first of his 8 goals in 12 appearances during his loan spell. Smith successfully steered the club out of the relegation zone at the end of 1992–93 with a run of eight matches unbeaten and paid a club record £500,000 to secure Cole&#x27;s services permanently. He further paid £250,000 for Everton midfielder Raymond Atteveld and signed West Ham United striker Leroy Rosenior.

Smith rebuilt the defence for 1993–94, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed start to the season. City won four straight home matches but also lost 5–1 to West Ham, 5–0 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4–0 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He found it difficult to control the club&#x27;s talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club&#x27;s directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.

===Oxford United===
Smith made a return to management with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 4–2 victory over his former club Bristol City. A victory over another former club, Stoke, took Oxford off the bottom of the Second Division, but a sequence of just 2 wins in 17 matches left them in great danger of relegation. He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne (£50,000 from Millwall) for the third time in his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career by bringing in defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for £170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant-killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a £600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by £60,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club&#x27;s top-scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick-started the club&#x27;s fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult run-in left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated.

The sale of star midfielder Joey Beauchamp to West Ham for a club record £1 million allowed Smith money to spend in the transfer market, and he spent £100,000 each on Norwich City midfielder David Smith and Sunderland striker David Rush. Oxford formed a strong promotion push in 1994–95, but were knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round by non-League Marlow. In February 1995, he spent £60,000 on Hartlepool United&#x27;s Phil Gilchrist, who would form a highly effective centre-back partnership with Elliott. Oxford finished the season in seventh place, six points outside the play-offs. In November 1995, Smith re-signed Beauchamp for £300,000, who continued his excellent form after returning to his native Oxfordshire. The next month he brought in striker Martin Aldridge on a free transfer. The club were 14th in January 1996, but lost only once in their last 17 matches of 1995–96 in a tremendous second half of the season that saw them climb 12 places to win promotion as runners-up. At the end of the season, Smith became a director of the club.

In order to strengthen for 1996–97, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent £100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for £450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday out of the League Cup en route to a fourth-round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached £13 million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for £1.7 million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club&#x27;s financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend £170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997–98 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club&#x27;s mid-table position at the end of the season.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Smith was appointed manager of West Brom on a three-year contract on 24 December 1997, with Oxford receiving around £100,000 in compensation. He had a mixed start to his time at the Hawthorns as Albion fell from promotion contenders to a tenth-place finish in 1997–98, but recorded victories over local rivals Wolves and Stoke.

In preparation for 1998–99, he signed athletic Derby centre-back Matt Carbon for £800,000, Blackpool striker James Quinn for £500,000, and Manchester City defender Jason van Blerk for £50,000. He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, the player who had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith&#x27;s arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith&#x27;s signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them ending up in 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, just a week before the start of 1999–2000.

===Return to Oxford===
On 3 February 2000, Smith was appointed manager of Oxford for the second time in his career, with the club 21st in the Second Division. He re-signed striker Nigel Jemson from Ayr United, and kept Oxford in the division as they ended 1999–2000 in 20th place, one place and one point above the relegation zone. He signed a one-year contract extension in the summer of 2000 but fell out with chairman Firoz Kassam. He later admitted that the signings he made on a limited budget, which included Ian McGuckin, Andy Scott and Rob Quinn, were not good enough. Smith resigned on 2 October 2000 after a terrible start to 2000–01, a season which ended in Oxford being relegated in last place. He continued to work as a scout for the club under Dave Kemp and then Mark Wright.

===Wrexham===
Smith returned to management on 8 October 2001 with Wrexham on a two-year contract, replacing Brian Flynn who had resigned after 12 years in charge, with the club 23rd in the Second Division. He was tasked with keeping the club steady whilst it struggled with financial problems. He decided to cut back on the club&#x27;s youth coaching spending, and as a result, Wrexham&#x27;s youth structure was downgraded from an academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.

He signed wing-back Paul Edwards and held on to most of his key players for the 2002–03 season. Wrexham had a good start to the season, and Smith won the Manager of the Month award for September 2002 after a sequence of four wins and two draws. A slump followed, but Wrexham recovered from a poor October 2002 after coming from behind to beat AFC Bournemouth on 9 November, as strikers Andy Morrell and Lee Trundle formed a good partnership, with Jones an impact substitute. Wrexham dropped out of the play-off places following a sequence of draws in March 2003, but new signing Scott Green scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Hartlepool United on 18 March, the first of a sequence of eight victories that took Wrexham into the third automatic promotion place with four matches to go. They held on to the position to secure promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt. Wrexham also beat Newport County 6–1 in the final of the FAW Premier Cup to secure an important £100,000 in prize money. Smith was named as the Manager of the Month for April and 2003, before winning the League Managers Association&#x27;s Third Division Manager of the Season award.

Smith lost Morrell and Trundle on free transfers and replaced them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club&#x27;s financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04. However, they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.

Writing in his autobiography, Smith described 2004–05 &quot;the most harrowing, distressing footballing time of my life&quot; as the club entered administration with debts of £2.6 million. Wrexham became the first club to be deducted 10 points for entering administration and were subsequently relegated from League One, eight points short of safety despite new signing Juan Ugarte scoring 23 goals. Despite the financial trouble Wrexham managed to win the Football League Trophy, knocking out Notts County, Stockport County, Chester City, Hereford United and Oldham Athletic en route to the final against Southend United at the Millennium Stadium. The final was settled in extra time, with Ugarte and Darren Ferguson securing a 2–0 victory. The club earned £250,000 in prize money and the first national trophy in Wrexham&#x27;s history.

Smith turned down the managerial role at Blackpool to remain in place at Wrexham for 2005–06. He signed goalkeeper Michael Ingham, defenders David Bayliss and Lee Roche, and strikers Lee McEvilly and Jonathan Walters, whilst blooding brothers Marc and Mike Williams. However, Wrexham struggled in the league despite on-loan striker Matt Derbyshire scoring 10 goals in 16 appearances. They finished the season 13th in League Two, having won only one of their last nine matches. The last match of the season was a 1–1 draw with former club Oxford, which hastened Oxford&#x27;s relegation out of the Football League.

Wrexham exited 18 months of administration at the start of 2006–07 and started the season with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 4–1 win over Championship club Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. However, a 5–0 defeat at Accrington Stanley triggered a run of bad results that Smith was unable to turn around. With Wrexham hovering above the relegation zone in 18th place, Smith was dismissed on 11 January 2007. He is one of only 24 people to have managed over 1,000 professional matches in English football.

==Personal life==
He married his childhood sweetheart Kate in October 1967. Their first child, Paul, was born in April 1969 and was named after teammate Paul Shardlow, who had died six months earlier. They had two further children: Becky (born 1971) and Tom (born 1978). Smith released his autobiography, &quot;Just One Of Seven&quot;, in November 2008. He writes a weekly column for &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and is occasionally a commentator on Stoke matches for BBC Radio Stoke. In July 2011, he re-joined Stoke on a part-time basis as a mentor for young Academy players needing guidance off the pitch. He was inducted into the Stoke-on-Trent Sporting Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1092152" wikidata="Q4116201" url="?curid=1092152" title="Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq">
<text>The Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq () is a group of religious leaders in Iraq. It was formed on the April 14, 2003, four days after the U.S.-led invasion demolished the Ba&#x27;athist regime of Saddam Hussein, by a group of scholars who aimed to represent Sunnis in Iraq. Though not a political party, the association is considered to be politically influential. It also administers a charitable fund set up for the upkeep of religious buildings.

==Membership==

Prominent members include Harith Sulayman al-Dhari (chairman), Muthanna Harith al-Dhari (chairman&#x27;s son and spokesman, secretary-general as of 2018), Abdel-Salam al-Kubaisi, Abdel-Sattar Abdel-Jabbar (founder, and senior official), Dr. Muhammad Bashar al-Faithi, Abdel Hamid Al-Ani, Ahmed Abdul Ghafour al-Samarrai, Mahdi Ibrahim, Abu Bashir al-Tarousi, and Umar Raghib.

==Political stances==

===Views===

The AMS did not join the newly formed government because it believed the political process to be illegitimate whilst Iraq remains under occupation. The group believes that: &quot;True democracy is impossible under occupation.”

According to the association&#x27;s spokesman in 2005 Muhammad al-Kubaysi, Iraq&#x27;s problems can be attributed to &quot;the presence of a foreign power that occupies this country and refuses even the mere scheduling of the withdrawal of its forces from Iraq.&quot; Members of the AMS met a senior US embassy official in January 2005 and asked for a timetable for US troop withdrawal. When this was refused, the group called for a boycott of the elections.

The AMS has been the group most critical of the occupation since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Sheikh Harith al-Dhari, the chairman of the group, has said: &quot;Iraq’s ordeal will not end unless the occupation ends. We must get rid of the occupation which is the cause of Iraq’s misery and pain. It acts as a cover and fuel for outsiders to meddle.&quot;

The association has been called an important force in giving the anti-occupation Sunni insurgency religious sanction in Iraq, with some of its leaders, such as Ayyash al-Kubaisi, openly endorsing the Sunni resistance as legitimate. However, they have consistently condemned all indiscriminate attacks on civilians, distinguishing between &#x27;terrorism&#x27; and &#x27;honorable resistance&#x27; and have negotiated for the release of Western hostages, as well as helping to arrange aid convoys to the city of Falluja when it was under siege.

When Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi called for &quot;a full-scale war on Shiites,&quot; at least one member of the association, Abu Bashir al-Tarousi, objected, pointing out that &quot;although sectarian war in Iraq may have been provoked and sparked by the Shia ... killing according to sectarian affiliation is not justified by Islamic law,&quot; and Muslims should not take &quot;justice into their own hands.&quot; He also expressed concern that the attacks would cause the &quot;legitimate Iraqi resistance&quot; to lose its credibility in the eyes of the Islamic world&quot; In 2018, the AMS reaffirmed its opposition to foreign forces in Iraq, while maintaining its denial of organizational links to al-Qaeda despite Chairman Harith al-Dhari&#x27;s inclusion on a terrorism list released by the Dawa Party-led government in Iraq.

The association has condemned the 2016 assault on Falluja as &quot;an unjust aggression, a reflection of the vengeful spirit that the forces of evil harbor against this city&quot;.

==Religious stances==
The AMS is a group of Sunni scholars. Many of its members favor the Hanbali school of fiqh law over the Hanafi school, which has traditionally been dominant among Sunnis in Iraq.

<text>Dulcie Evonne September (20 August 1935 – 29 March 1988) was a South African anti-apartheid political activist who was assassinated in Paris, France, in 1988.

==Early life==
The second eldest daughter of Jakobus and Susan September, September grew up in Gleemore, a suburb of Cape Town, where she developed her interest in political activism. She began her primary schooling at Klipfontein Methodist Mission, and later attended Athlone High School. In 1954, she enrolled at the Wesley Training School in Salt River to pursue a career in teaching, and completed her Teacher&#x27;s Diploma in 1955. She began her teaching career, first at City Mission School in Maitland, then at Bridgetown East Primary School in Athlone in 1956, and in 1957 became a member of the newly established Cape Peninsula Students&#x27; Union (CPSU), affiliate of the Unity Movement of South Africa, which aimed at overcoming racial divisions and forging solidarity among students of different cultural backgrounds. She belonged to the Athlone branch of the Teacher&#x27;s League of South Africa (TLSA).

==Activism==
September subsequently joined the African Peoples&#x27; Democratic Union of Southern Africa (APDUSA), established in 1960. She went on to be a member of the militant study group Yu Chi Chan Club, which was disbanded at the end of 1962, to be replaced by the National Liberation Front (NLF) in January 1963. While engaged in NLF activities, she was arrested and detained without trial at Roeland Street Prison on 7 October 1963. Together with nine others she was charged under the Criminal Procedure Act, the principal charge being &quot;conspiracy to commit acts of sabotage, and incite acts of politically motivated violence&quot;. After months of court proceedings, judgment was delivered on 15 April 1964. September was sentenced to five years imprisonment, during which time she endured severe physical and psychological abuse. On her release in April 1969, the Pretoria regime controlled her activities with a five-year banning order, which prohibited her from engaging in political activity and from practising her profession. September then went to live with her sister in Paarl.

In 1973, as her banning order drew to a close, September applied for a permanent departure permit, having secured a position at Madeley College of Education in Staffordshire. She left South Africa on 19 December 1973. In London, she joined the activities of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and was in the frontline of numerous political rallies and demonstrations at South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. Later she gave up her job as a teacher and joined the staff of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa. In 1976 she joined the African National Congress (ANC) where she worked in the ANC Women&#x27;s League. In 1979, International Year of the Child (IYC), she was elected chairperson of the IYC Committee of the ANC Women&#x27;s Section in London. At the end of 1983, September was appointed ANC Chief Representative in France, Switzerland and Luxembourg.

==Death==
On the morning of 29 March 1988, September was shot dead outside the ANC&#x27;s Paris office at 28, Rue des Petites-Écuries, as she was opening the office after collecting the mail. She was 52 years old. Her death stoked a strong popular reaction in Paris where more than 20,000 gathered to mourn.

Before her assassination, September had been investigating trafficking of weapons between France and South Africa. On the day after her murder, Alfred Nzo, secretary-general of the African National Congress, commented: &quot;If ever there was a soft target, Dulcie September was one.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Arts and media===
Jean-Michel Jarre composed a song for his 1988 &quot;Revolutions&quot; album named &quot;September&quot;, dedicated to Dulcie September. The song was performed at his Destination Docklands concert at London&#x27;s Royal Victoria Dock in October 1988, and features on the album recording of this, &quot;Jarre Live&quot; (1989).

The conceptual artist Hans Haacke devoted his 1989 installation &quot;One Day, The Lions of Dulcie September Will Spout Water in Jubilation&quot; to her. The site-specific intervention that modified an existing but defunct fountain in front of the Grande halle de la Villette in Paris, was part of the exhibition Magiciens de la terre by Jean-Martin Hubert.

Her short story &quot;A Split Society – Fast Sounds on the Horizon&quot; was included in the 1992 anthology &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby.

&quot;Cold Case: Revisiting Dulcie September&quot; is a play that pays tribute to Dulcie September. A book about her murder, &quot;Dulcie: Een Vrouw Die Haar Mond Moest Houden&quot; by Evelyn Groenink, was published in the Netherlands in 2001. A podcast about the murder of Dulcie September, &quot;They Killed Dulcie&quot; by Open Secrets and Sound Africa, was released in March 2019. The 2021 documentary &quot;Murder in Paris&quot; (directed by Enver Samuel and edited by Nikki Comninos) explores the life and assassination of September.

===Memorials and dedications===
A square in the 10th arrondissement of Paris is named after Dulcie September, and was officially inaugurated on 31 March 1998, ten years after her death. A street in Cléon, near Rouen, is named after her. There is also a place named Dulcie September in Nantes, and a primary school in Évry-sur-Seine carries her name as well as a middle school (&quot;collège&quot; in French) in Arcueil, the town near Paris where she last lived.

In August 2010, the first Dulcie September Memorial Lecture took place at The Centre for Humanities Research of the University of the Western Cape, as well as the launch of the Dulcie September Fellowship Awards in the Humanities and Social Sciences that featured speakers including Barbara Masekela and Margaret Busby.

In October 2011, Staffordshire University Students&#x27; Union honoured Dulcie September by renaming their boardroom the &quot;September Room&quot; and erecting a plaque in her memory. She was a former student of Madeley College of Education, one of the founding colleges of North Staffordshire Polytechnic.

In 2013 the Athlone Civic Centre was renamed the Dulcie September Civic Centre.

In Amsterdam, Netherlands, a road in the city&#x27;s Transvaalbuurt is named Dulcie Septemberpad. Other buildings and streets in the neighbourhood have also been named after prominent historic South Africans, including Steve Bikoplein, Nelson Mandela School and Retiefstraat.

<doc id="1092161" wikidata="Q4577643" url="?curid=1092161" title="1977 Fijian constitutional crisis">
<text>Fiji&#x27;s parliamentary election of March 1977 precipitated a constitutional crisis, which was the first major challenge to the country&#x27;s democratic institutions since independence in 1970.

Politics in the years before and after independence had been dominated by the conflicting interests of the ethnic Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities. At that time, Indo-Fijians slightly outnumbered ethnic Fijians, but by holding a virtual monopoly of the ethnic Fijian vote and by making significant inroads into the Indo-Fijian electorate (taking almost a quarter of their votes in the election of 1972), &quot;Ratu Sir&quot; Kamisese Mara&#x27;s Alliance Party had maintained its grip on power. A split in the indigenous vote in 1977, however, resulted in a narrow win for the Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party (NFP). 

Sidiq Koya, the NFP leader, was expected to become Prime Minister.

Instead, the Governor-General, &quot;Ratu Sir&quot; George Cakobau, called on Mara to form a caretaker government, pending new elections scheduled for September. The events that led to his decision, and his reasons for it, are still mired in controversy, with different parties involved telling different versions of the situation, and conspiracy theories have abounded. What is known is that a leadership struggle immediately following the election seriously fractured the NFP. It failed to name a Cabinet for three days, and a crisis began to develop. A prominent NFP parliamentarian, Jai Ram Reddy, wondered aloud on national radio whether his party was ready to form a government, and whether it would in fact be able to do so. Ratu Mara claimed in his 1996 autobiography, &quot;The Pacific Way&quot;, that NFP politicians had approached him and asked him to remain in office, but with an NFP Cabinet; he claimed to have refused.

Some accused Jai Ram Reddy of sabotaging the formation of a government in order to challenge Koya for the leadership of the party, which he did successfully once NFP had been divided and Koya had been weakened in support. Other possible traitors within the NFP were also named. Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry claimed in his 2004 book, &quot;Children of the Indus&quot;, that parliamentarians Chand Ramrakha and Irene Jai Narayan had betrayed their own leader by telling the Governor-General that not all NFP caucus members would support Koya for Prime Minister. &quot;There is also some basis to the story that Karam Ramrakha and Irene Jai Narayan had informed Ratu Sir George secretly that Koya did not enjoy the support of all NFP parliamentarians. Regrettably, at the hour of his triumph Koya had been stabbed in the back by his own people,&quot; he wrote. Ramrakha, now a lawyer based in Sydney, Australia, sued for defamation, saying that the claim was false and had damaged his reputation but was unsuccessful.

Others, both in Fiji and abroad, accused the Governor-General, a high chief in the Fijian chiefly hierarchy, of deliberate bias, and took his usurping of a popular election to preserve the government of his fellow-chief (and distant cousin), Ratu Mara, as an indication that the indigenous Fijian elite would not tolerate an Indo-Fijian-led government. Proponents of this theory point to the coups of 1987 and of 2000, both of which toppled governments dominated or led by Indo-Fijians, as evidence of their belief. Whether this controversial opinion is true or not, few doubt that Ratu Sir George Cakobau was pleased to be able to reappoint the government dominated by indigenous Fijians.

In a public statement, Ratu Sir George Cakobau defended his actions thus:

The September election called to resolve the impasse resulted in a landslide win for the Fijian Alliance, which remained in power for another decade.

<doc id="1092169" wikidata="Q5513828" url="?curid=1092169" title="General Motors Atlas engine">
<text>Atlas is a name for a family of modern inline piston engines for trucks from General Motors, used in the GMT355 and GMT360 platforms. The series debuted in 2002 with the Oldsmobile Bravada, and is also used in the Buick Rainier, the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and Colorado, the GMC Envoy and Canyon, the Hummer H3, Isuzu Ascender and i-370, and the Saab 9-7X. The engines use GM&#x27;s Vortec name, and straight-4, straight-5, and straight-6 engines are all part of the same family, sharing the same manufacturing equipment, rods, pistons, valves, and other parts. They feature coil-on-plug ignition systems, variable valve timing on the exhaust side, electronic throttle control, and a special oil pan with a pass-through for the half shafts in four-wheel drive vehicles. The inclusion of VVT on the exhaust camshaft side allows the Atlas series to meet emissions standards without the use of EGR, simplifying the engine design and increasing power for a broad power curve. The LL8 shares 75% of its components with the LK5 and L52; while the LK5 and L52 share 89% of their components.

The Atlas engines feature aluminum cylinder blocks and heads, with the cylinder bores featuring replaceable steel cylinder liners. The 4- and 5-cylinder versions feature dual balance shafts, balance shafts being unnecessary in the 6-cylinder.

The Atlas program began in 1995 along with the planning for GM&#x27;s next-generation mid-size SUVs and pickup trucks. These vehicles were designed around the I6 engine. The I6 version was used in a Baja 1000 racing truck, winning its first race in a class that also included V8 engines. Another I6-powered truck won the truck class at the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb.

The Atlas engines were produced at the Flint Engine South plant in Flint, Michigan, while the I4 and I5 versions were produced at the Tonawanda Engine plant in Tonawanda, New York, near Buffalo.

== LL8 (Vortec 4200) ==

The LL8 (or Vortec 4200), is a straight-6 gasoline engine produced from 2002 to 2009. It was the first Atlas engine, and was introduced in 2002 for the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, and Oldsmobile Bravada. The engine was also used in the Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X, and Isuzu Ascender.

It displaces , with a bore and stroke. It has four valves per cylinder, utilizes dual-overhead cams (DOHC) design, and features variable valve timing on the exhaust cam, a first for GM inline engines. When introduced, this engine&#x27;s power was at 6,000 rpm and torque was at 3,600 rpm. 2003 saw a slight bump in power to , while torque was unchanged. For 2006, power was increased to at 6,000 rpm and torque to ) at 4800 rpm with the addition of a MAF and a complete internal redesign of the engine; however, due to the new SAE rating procedures, ratings can vary slightly between years. The engine redline is 6,300 rpm. The LL8 was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2002 through 2005 and was the basis for all the other Atlas engines. With the closure of the Moraine, Ohio, plant and the discontinuation of the GMT360 platform (Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, etc.), production of the LL8 also ended.

<text>Alberto Rabagliati (27 June 1906 – 8 March 1974) was an Italian jazz singer.

== Early career==
Alberto Rabagliati was born in Milan in 1906 and was the son of a Piedmontese couple: his father Leandro Valentino Rabagliati and his mother Delfina Besso were both natives of Casorzo, a comune (municipality) in the hills of the Montferrat in the Province of Asti (Italy). In 1927, he moved to Hollywood after winning a Rudolph Valentino look-alike contest. He later recalled: &quot;For someone like me, who had seen no more than Lake Como or Monza Cathedral so far, finding myself on board a luxury steamer with three cases full of clothes, a few rolls of dollars, grand-duchesses and countesses flirting with me was something extraordinary&quot;. He remained in America for four years, but his career as an actor never took off. However, during his stay he had the opportunity to get to know new musical genres such as jazz, swing, and scat singing.

Alberto Rabagliati married Maria Antonietta Tonnini in Rome in 1954.

== Singing ==
Back in Europe, he became a singer. After a brief period with Pippo Barzizza&#x27;s orchestra, he joined in 1934 the Lecuona Cuban Boys, a Cuban band. He performed in blackface and made a hit with the song &quot;Maria la O&quot;.

While with the Lecuona Cuban Boys, he met Giovanni D&#x27;Anzi who suggested that he audition with the Italian state radio station EIAR. Rabagliati soon became a radio star, and in 1941 had his own radio show. Every Monday night EIAR (RAI) aired &quot;Canta Rabagliati&quot; (&quot;Rabagliati sings&quot;), with the singer presenting his most famous songs such as &quot;Ma l&#x27;amore no&quot;, &quot;Mattinata fiorentina&quot;, &quot;Ba-Ba-Baciami Piccina&quot;, &quot;Silenzioso slow&quot;, &quot;Bambina innamorata&quot;.

He was so popular that his name was sung in the lyrics of &quot;La famiglia canterina&quot;, &quot;Quando canta Rabagliati&quot;, &quot;Quando la radio&quot;. At a time when anything foreign was banned, the idol Rabagliati was allowed to maintain his American-influenced style. Indeed, the Fascist government decided to make use of his popularity by choosing his song &quot;Sposi (c&#x27;è una casetta piccina)&quot; (&quot;Wed (there&#x27;s a little home)&quot;) as their demographic campaign anthem.

== Acting ==
His fame as a singer helped his acting career restart. From 1940 to 1965 he acted in some twenty films, including &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;, &quot;Montecarlo&quot; and &quot;Il vedovo&quot;. In 1966, he starred in &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

Rabagliati was active also on the stage until the mid-1950s. He performed in musical revues and comedies by Garinei and Giovannini.

His last public appearance was in 1974 as a guest in the TV show &quot;Milleluci&quot; hosted by Mazzini Mina and Raffaella Carrà. Soon afterward he died of cerebral thrombosis.

<text>The subjective character of experience is a term in psychology and the philosophy of mind denoting that all subjective phenomena are associated with a single point of view (&quot;ego&quot;). The term was coined and illuminated by Thomas Nagel in his famous paper &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot;

Nagel argues that, because bats are apparently conscious mammals with a way of perceiving their environment entirely different from that of human beings, it is impossible to speak of &quot;what is it like to &quot;be&quot; a bat &quot;for&quot; the bat&quot; or, while the example of the bat is particularly illustrative, any conscious species, as each organism has a unique point of view from which no other organism can gather experience. To Nagel, the subjective character of experience implies the cognitive closure of the human mind to some facts, specifically the mental states that physical states create.

<text>Vernon Corea (11 September 1927 – 23 September 2002) was a pioneer radio broadcaster with 45 years of public service broadcasting both in Sri Lanka and the UK. He joined Radio Ceylon, South Asia&#x27;s oldest radio station, in 1956 and later the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. During his time he presented some of the most popular radio shows in South Asia, including &quot;The Maliban Show&quot;, &quot;Dial-a-Disc&quot;, &quot;Holiday Choice&quot;, &quot;Two For the Money&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;, &quot;Saturday Stars&quot;, &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, &quot;Kiddies Corner&quot;, and &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. He was well known not only in Sri Lanka, but right across the Indian Sub-Continent from the late 1950s to the 1970s – this was in the heyday of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia.

==Early life==

Corea was born in Kurana, Katunayake, Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka) on 11 September 1927. His parents were Reverend Canon Ivan Corea and Ouida Corea, and was the brother of Ernest Corea, a prominent journalist and former Ambassador to the United States. Rev. Corea was Vicar of St. Luke&#x27;s Church, Borella, and St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Milagiriya.

His family hailed from the west coast town of Chilaw in Sri Lanka and were direct descendants of General Dominicus Corea, also known as Edirille Rala who was tasked to take over Kotte in 1596 for King Vimala Dharmasurya I. His grandfather was Dr. James Alfred Ernest Corea, brother of the famed freedom fighters of Sri Lanka, Charles Edgar Corea and Victor Corea, founders of the Chilaw Association and the Ceylon National Congress. Recognising their role in the independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, known as the &#x27;Father of India,&#x27; visited Chilaw on his first and only visit to Ceylon in 1927 and met Vernon&#x27;s grandfather in a Corea home called &#x27;Sigiriya.&#x27;

Vernon Corea was educated at Royal College, Colombo a well known education institution, in Sri Lanka. He represented the school in tennis and was fully involved in the world of drama and the debating society. He was sent by his father to Bishop’s College, Calcutta, India for training into the priesthood. In Calcutta he was elected President of the Ceylon Students Association and acted in drama performances. He felt that the priesthood was not his vocation and returned to Ceylon, after the death of his mother.

==Career==
Following brief careers in teaching at Uva College in Badulla (where he met his wife Monica) and as a salesman at Car Mart in Colombo, Vernon Corea joined Radio Ceylon as a Relief Announcer in 1956, he was appointed by the Director of the Commercial Service, the Australian, Clifford Dodd and his assistant Livy Wijemanne. He became well known as &quot;The Golden Voice of Radio Ceylon&quot;, representing shows of popular music, baila music, and western music. He was later Business Manager, News Director at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.Corea represented the Director-General of the station at a Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference, when he was in the United Kingdom, on a six-month fellowship with the Nuffield Trust in 1970.

From 1956 to 1960, Vernon Corea and other announcers of Radio Ceylon introduced the music of Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, Louis Armstrong, Jim Reeves, Hank Snow, and Cliff Richard over the airwaves of Radio Ceylon/Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. They became hugely popular in South Asia.

Throughout his life and his broadcasting career Corea promoted the very best of Sri Lankan talent in the world of popular music. He was the first to consistently promote Sri Lanka&#x27;s musicians through his highly influential entertainment column – EMCEE published in the Ceylon Daily News in the 1960s–1970s. Vernon introduced hundreds of musicians to listeners at Radio Ceylon/Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and in the studios of BBC Radio London when he presented the popular London Sounds Eastern radio programme. He &#x27;discovered&#x27; many young Sri Lankan stars through his radio programmes on Radio Ceylon and promoted their musical talents in the EMCEE column in the Daily News in Colombo. Some went onto the international stage.

Some of Ceylon&#x27;s first music stars such as Nimal Mendis, Bill Forbes, Des Kelly and Cliff Foenander, were interviewed by Vernon Corea, for Radio Ceylon. Their music was also introduced to a vast audience across the Indian sub-continent – millions tuned into the radio station and Radio Ceylon announcers enjoyed iconic status with South Asian listeners.
The respected &quot;Hindu&quot; newspaper of India placed Vernon Corea in the Top 5 Broadcasters of the World stating that he introduced Sinhala Music onto the English Services of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He was the first to introduce the talents of Clarence Wijewardena, Annesley Malewana, and others on English radio programmes, on Radio Ceylon.

As a special tribute to Vernon Corea&#x27;s father, Reverend Canon Ivan Corea, the Sri Lankan superstar Clarence Wijewardena composed a moving song about a father&#x27;s love,&#x27;Ma Ethi Dedi Kala Piyaneni.&#x27; It was an international hit for Clarence Wijewardena and Annesley Malewana. In an interview, Annesley Malewanna recalls: &quot;&quot;When we toured England in 1994 to hold musical shows, Vernon Corea who was in England requested me to sing this particular song. When I got on to the stage and started singing Vernon broke down and all of us were moved by this incident. Wherever we go, most people in foreign countries requested me to sing this song. Now I dedicate that song to my late father&quot;, he said. &quot;

==Television==
Vernon Corea created television history on the island of Sri Lanka when he was invited to present the first ever experimental television broadcast on 15 June 1972 by the &quot;Radio Society of Ceylon.&quot; He appeared on television screens in Colombo, in black and white, on a short TV programme, this was history in the making. Seven years later the first regular television transmission was conducted in Sri Lanka and the first TV presenter on that regular transmission was Vernon Corea&#x27;s cousin, Vijaya Corea – he introduced his cousin to radio by asking him to present &#x27;Kiddies Corner&#x27; a popular children&#x27;s programme on Radio Ceylon in the 1960s. Vijaya Corea was one of many young broadcasters &quot;mentored&quot; by Vernon Corea – he went on to become the Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Another protégé was Nihal Bhareti who went on to greater height heights in broadcasting and was the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Director of English Services. Leon Belleth was another mentee, after a successful career with Radio Ceylon/SLBC he retired in Australia.

There are now several television stations operating on the island, a far cry from the early experiments of the Radio Society of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1972.

==The BBC==

The Corea family migrated to England in 1975. Vernon Corea worked for Radio Worldwide based in Upper Norwood, then for BBC Radio London as a presenter for the popular London Sounds Eastern. He interviewed many Asian stars, including Pandit Ravi Shankar and Usha Uthup. The BBC radio programme drew a huge audience in the capital and was even featured in the Radio Times. Vernon Corea soon climbed the management ladder at the BBC – he was appointed Local Radio Asian Programmes Officer in 1978. He went on to become the &quot;Ethnic Minorities Adviser&quot; to the BBC; This was a senior management appointment – he held this post at the BBC until his retirement. Vernon Corea played a pivotal role in introducing and mentoring young, gifted and talented people into broadcasting. He trained minority ethnic broadcasters and found placements for them on the BBC Local Radio Network. His work contributed to the diversity of the BBC. Vernon Corea also lectured at the BBC Training Centre. Many of Corea&#x27;s trainees are now presenters of mainstream radio programmes on BBC Radio. Among those who came to seek Vernon Corea&#x27;s advice was the top BBC News Presenter, George Alagiah.

Corea was also invited to Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives to train broadcasters and was introduced to the President of the Maldives on a visit to Male, the capital.

==Church Work==
Vernon Corea was a Christian, he was very involved in the work of the church in the UK – he was a Lay Reader of the Church of England at Emmanuel Church, Wimbledon in South-West London and previous to that appointment he was Lay Reader at Christ Church, Gipsy Hill in South-East London.

Recalling his life, Reginald Massey noted in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Corea was a born broadcaster and racy raconteur, prone to making outrageous remarks with a straight face. But behind his frivolous manner was a generous and large-hearted Christian, who was also a lay reader at Emmanuel church in Wimbledon village, in south-west London.&quot; &#x27;

==Autism==
The struggles of parents, carers, children and adults with autism was something Corea cared deeply about, after his own grandson was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. He raised awareness of the condition. In 2002 he attended a historic service for autism held at St.Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London and wrote Prayers for Autism. These prayers are now being said on Autism Sunday commemorated annually, by churches and religious organisations across the world, on the second Sunday in February.

He died of diabetes, in New Malden in London on 23 September 2002.

==Quotes on Vernon Corea==
&#x27;Vernon was a pioneering influence in the BBC and helped to lay the foundation for the work we are continuing to do to make sure our staff and our programmes are truly representative of our nation&#x27;s diverse population.&#x27; (Greg Dyke – Director-General BBC)

&#x27;His sense of loyalty to his management and to his profession and his compassion and concern for those who worked under him were exemplary.&#x27; (Neville Jayaweera – former Director-General SLBC)

&#x27;The BBC at this time was striving to be more inclusive, and Corea found himself at the forefront of an increasing thrust for diversity. His importance both as a figurehead and a consultant was recognised by his appointment as the first ethnic minorities adviser in 1978.&#x27; (The Times)

<doc id="1092208" wikidata="Q2307316" url="?curid=1092208" title="Alexandra, South Africa">
<text>Alexandra, informally abbreviated to Alex, is a township in the Gauteng province of South Africa. It forms part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality and is located next to the wealthy suburb of Sandton. Alexandra is bounded by Wynberg on the west, Marlboro and Kelvin on the north, Kew, Lombardy West and Lombardy East on the south. Alexandra is one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Alexandra is situated on the banks of the Jukskei River. In addition to its original, reasonably well-built houses, it also has a large number (estimated at more than 20,000) of informal dwellings or &quot;shacks&quot; called imikhukhu.

== History ==

===Early history===
Alexandra was established in 1912, on land originally owned by a farmer, a Mr H.B. Papenfus, who tried to establish a white residential township there, naming it after his wife, Alexandra. However, because it was (at the time) a considerable distance from the centre of Johannesburg, this was not a great success. Consequently, in 1912, Alexandra was proclaimed as a so-called &quot;native township&quot;. Because the township was proclaimed before the South African 1913 Land Act, it was one of the few urban areas in the country where black people could own land under a freehold title.

By 1916, the population of Alexandra had grown to 30,000 people. The Alexandra Health Committee was established to manage the township. However, the Committee was not allowed to collect local taxes, nor was the Johannesburg City Council willing to take responsibility for an area that it claimed fell outside its jurisdiction, leading to a lack of resources and proper management. When the National Party came into power in 1948 and started to implement its policy of apartheid, Alexandra was put under the direct control of the then Department of Native Affairs.

===1950–2000===

In the early 1960s, the government decided to demolish all family accommodation in Alexandra and replace them with single-sex hostels, which led to widespread resistance and protest. However, owing to the high costs, lack of alternative housing for the persons that would have to have been removed and the escalating opposition led by the Reverend Sam Buti&#x27;s &quot;Save Alexandra Party&quot;, only two hostels were actually completed, and so the scheme was cancelled in 1979.

The riots that started in Soweto in June 1976 quickly spread to other areas such as Alexandra, where 19 people were killed. As a consequence of these riots, evictions, forced removals and expropriation of black properties were stopped; city blacks were no longer viewed as transient residents and their permanent status used to be recognised.

Finally, in 1982, Alexandra was given the official status of a residential area and the then Alexandra liaison committee, led by Rev Buti, was instituted to run the township.

In 1980 a &quot;Master Plan&quot; for Alexandra was introduced, whose aim was to transform Alexandra into a &quot;Garden City&quot; with a completely new layout. However, only a small part of this plan was actually ever implemented; the execution of the &quot;Master Plan&quot; was permanently stopped by the violent &quot;Alex Six Days&quot; uprising in February 1986. The uprising resulted from an attack by the security forces on a funeral in the township. 40 people were killed. The Alexandra Township Committee, led by trade unionist Moses Mayekiso, were arrested and beaten. Mayekiso was only released following a strike by metal workers. 

By May the council started collapsing and the councillors resigned which saw the emergence of street committees and peoples&#x27; courts. After the imposition of the nationwide state of emergency in June, the Defence Force moved in to keep the peace. In its place, the government introduced the &quot;Urban Renewal Plan&quot; as part of its strategy during the state of emergency. However, this plan led to considerable demolitions, disruptions and displacement in the community as well as two treason trials involving 13 leaders of Alexandra.

This, combined with the considerable number of additional people moving into Alexandra during this time, led to a new area called the &quot;East Bank&quot; being built. Because of the insufficient capacity and difficult maintenance of the newly built infrastructure, the situation quickly deteriorated and thus the &quot;Urban Renewal Plan&quot; was shelved in 1990. During the communal and political conflicts that took place in the 1991–1992 period, many people were killed, injured or displaced. This led to several peace initiatives, which were greatly assisted by the first fully democratic South African elections in April 1994.

===2000s to present===

To assist in renewing and uplift the community, the Alexandra Renewal Project was launched in 2000. The project has caused clashes between residents and companies, including SA Waste Holdings (Pty) Ltd, a waste disposal company based in nearby Marlboro.

Approximately 3,000 houses have been built for relocation purposes to date. In August 2006 an American business student conducted a photography project with 190 of the youth of Alexandra. It resulted in a book, alexandra: our view of ekasi. In June/July 2008 the grassroots photographic project &quot;Shooting Jozi&quot; inspired by the Academy award-winning documentary &quot;Born into Brothels&quot; took place in Alexandra with local community members.

In May 2008 a series of xenophobic attacks that took place throughout South Africa started in Alexandra Township. Foreigners including Zimbabweans, Mozambicans, Congolese, and even some South Africans from the north living there were attacked.

<text>Janko Vuković, sometimes spelt Janko Vukovich or von Vukovich, also known as Janko Vuković de Podkapelski or Janko Vuković-Podkapelski (27 September 1871 – 1 November 1918) was a Croatian naval officer who served in the Austro-Hungarian Navy and - amidst its collapse - for a brief period as commander of the fleet of the fledgling State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Vuković saw action in World War I and was appointed commander of the fleet in October 1918 as Austria-Hungary disintegrated and the entire navy was handed over to the fledgling State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. He died on board the , sunk by Italian commandos.

==Biography==
He attended the Naval Academy in Fiume (modern Rijeka), and in his naval career he commanded the pre-Dreadnought , the fast light cruiser , and rose to command of the fleet&#x27;s flagship, the dreadnought by the end of the First World War.

== &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; sinking ==

On October 29, 1918 the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs broke off all relations with Austria and Hungary, establishing the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Subsequently, Emperor Charles I gave the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy, merchant fleet, and all its installations to the new state. When representatives of the National Council arrived at the naval base at Pula on October 31, the commander in chief, Admiral Miklós Horthy, asked to whom he should hand over command of the fleet. The representatives had not considered the matter, and after some discussion accepted Horthy&#x27;s suggestion of Vuković, who was promoted to rear-admiral and made commander in chief of the new country&#x27;s navy when Horthy&#x27;s flag was lowered at 5 pm.

Overnight, an Italian sabotage team from a nearby patrol boat, who had not heard of the new State&#x27;s creation and non-belligerence, penetrated the harbour and laid two 200 kg mines under the ready to explode at 6:30 sharp. The two-man team was captured and taken aboard &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, where they informed Vuković of what they had done.

Vuković arranged for the prisoners (Raffaele Paolucci and Raffaele Rossetti) to be taken safely to the sister ship , and ordered the evacuation of the ship. But the explosion did not happen at 6:30 and Vukovic returned to the ship with many sailors. He therefore remained on his ship and went down with her and 300-400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44. Vuković had been commander-in-chief of his country&#x27;s fleet for barely twelve hours.

==Legacy==
Vuković&#x27;s widow Helena honored him with a plaque on a navy chapel at naval graveyard in Pula in 1919. A memorial plaque commemorating his birthplace was attached to his birthhouse in Jezerane in 1994. His name is also preserved on a plaque honouring all admirals that graduated from the former in Rijeka, unveiled by Croatian President Ivo Josipović on Navy Day in 2011. Central square in Brinje and a street in Zagreb are named after Vuković.

Vuković&#x27;s tragic fate and his sense of honor and duty have inspired an eponymous song by cabaret-rock band from Pula &quot;Gori Ussi Winnetou&quot; as well as two novels: &quot;Admiral&quot; by Stjepan Vukušić and &quot;Admiralski stijeg&quot; by Ivan Katušić.

<doc id="1092225" wikidata="Q423338" url="?curid=1092225" title="20-Hydroxyecdysone">
<text>20-Hydroxyecdysone (ecdysterone or 20E) is a naturally occurring ecdysteroid hormone which controls the ecdysis (moulting) and metamorphosis of arthropods. It is therefore one of the most common moulting hormones in insects, crabs, etc. A phytoecdysteroid produced by various plants, including &quot;Cyanotis vaga&quot;, &quot;Ajuga turkestanica&quot; and &quot;Rhaponticum carthamoides&quot;, its purpose is presumably to disrupt the development and reproduction of insect pests. In arthropods, 20-hydroxyecdysone acts through the ecdysone receptor. Although mammals lack this receptor, 20-hydroxyecdysone affects mammalian biological systems. 20-Hydroxyecdysone is an ingredient of some supplements that aim to enhance physical performance. In humans, it is hypothesized to bind to the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) protein-coding gene.

==Sources in arthropods==
The primary sources of 20-hydroxyecdysone in larvae are the prothoracic gland, ring gland, gut, and fat bodies. These tissues convert dietary cholesterol into the mature forms of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. For the most part, these glandular tissues are lost in the adult, with exception of the fat body, which is retained as a sheath of lipid tissue surrounding the brain and organs of the abdomen. In the adult female, the ovary is a substantial source of 20-hydroxyecdysone production. Adult males are left with, so far as is currently known, one source of 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is the fat body tissue. These hormone-producing tissues express the ecdysone receptor throughout development, possibly indicating a functional feedback mechanism.

==Ecdysteroid activity in arthropods==

In insects, an ecdysteroid is a type of steroid hormone derived from enzymatic modification of cholesterol by p450 enzymes. This occurs by a mechanism similar to steroid synthesis in vertebrates. Ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone regulate larval molts, onset of puparium formation, and metamorphosis. As these hormones are hydrophobic, they traverse lipid membranes and permeate the tissues of an organism. Indeed, the ecdysone receptor is an intracellular protein.

==In humans and other mammals==

===Use as research tool===
20-Hydroxyecdysone and other ecdysteroids are used in biochemistry research as inducers in transgenic animals, whereby a new gene is introduced into an animal so that its expression is under the control of an introduced ecdysone receptor. Adding or removing ecdysteroids from the animal&#x27;s diet then gives a convenient way to turn the inserted gene on or off. At usual doses, 20-hydroxyecdysone appears to have little or no effect on animals that do not have extra genes inserted. Given its high oral bioavailability, therefore, it is useful for determining whether the transgene has been taken up effectively. However, studies mentioned below show that 20E is not totally inert in non-transgenic mammals.

===Use as supplement===
20-Hydroxyecdysone and other ecdysteroids are marketed as ingredients in nutritional supplements for various sports, particularly bodybuilding. Although a number of early studies supported the anabolic effects of 20-hydroxyecdysone, a 2006 study concluded that the use of 30 mg per day of 20-hydroxyecdysone administered orally did not significantly affect anabolic or catabolic responses to resistance training, body composition, or training adaptations. However, a 2019 study found significantly higher increases in muscle mass and one-repetition bench press performance in participants dosed with ecdysterone. The study, funded by the World Anti-Doping Agency, demonstrated a significant dose-responsive anabolic effect. Other studies have elucidated the mechanism of action of 20-hydroxyecdysone on human muscle cells, which appears to involve relatively selective activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), known to result in muscle hypertrophy.

=== Drug development ===
In 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved a study on the efficacy of BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) in treating obesity, focusing on muscle strength improvement in the lower limbs.

<text>Ernesto Pietro Bonino (16 January 1922 – 29 April 2008) was an Italian singer of pop and jazz standards whose peak of popularity was during the 1940s and 50s.

A native of Turin, Ernesto Bonino began his career in the late 1930s as a teenage singer in the lively club scene of his hometown. Another contemporary Turin performer, Fred Buscaglione, was also starting his singing occupation in the same fashion. Music impresario/conductor Carlo Prato, who had earlier promoted a Dutch sister act into the very popular Trio Lescano, heard Bonino and arranged an audition for him at the Italian state radio company EIAR. His broadcast debut came on 5 January 1941 with the song &quot;Tango Argentino&quot;. It was an instant success and other hits followed, including &quot;La Paloma&quot;, &quot;Se Fossi Milionario&quot;, &quot;La Famiglia Canterina&quot; (with Trio Lescano), &quot;A Zonzo&quot;, &quot;Musica Maestro&quot;, &quot;Il Giovanotto Matto&quot;, &quot;Ti Comprerò l&#x27;Armonica&quot; and &quot;Conosci Mia Cugina?&quot;. During the 1940s, Bonino, dubbed &quot;Mister Swing&quot;, rivalled only Natalino Otto and Alberto Rabagliati in terms of popularity.

In 1947, two years after the end of World War II, he embarked on a long tour of Latin America, performing in Peru, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Cuba, where he and actress/singer Tina De Mola took Havana theatergoers by storm with their song &quot;Chinito chinita&quot;.

In 1952 Ernesto Bonino moved to the United States and realized his dream of singing jazz standards in the best clubs of New York City, Chicago and Miami. He made a brief comeback to Italy in 1955 for the Garinei and Giovannini musical comedy &quot;La Granduchessa e i camerieri&quot; (&quot;The Grand Duchess and the Valets&quot;). When the run was finished, he returned to the U.S. and remained until 1958. His sole participation in the renowned Sanremo Music Festival came in 1962, when he placed third with &quot;Gondolì, Gondolà&quot;, written by the duo Carosone-Nisa. After the contest, Carosone hired him for the European tour of his band.

After that successful tour, however, changing musical tastes slowly led to the fading of Bonino&#x27;s popularity and, in 1986, he underwent a surgical procedure which resulted in the loss of his voice. By December 2000, when he was nearly eighty, the state recognized his artistic merit and contribution to Italian culture by granting him a special government life pension.

Ernesto Bonino was 86 years old when he died at the Giuseppe Verdi Retirement Home for Artists in Milan, where he had been residing since 23 April 2003.

<doc id="1092232" wikidata="Q1136014" url="?curid=1092232" title="New Kowloon">
<text>New Kowloon is an area in Hong Kong, bounded to the south by Boundary Street, and to the north by the ranges of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest, Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, Tate&#x27;s Cairn and Kowloon Peak. It covers the present-day Kwun Tong District and Wong Tai Sin District, and northern parts of the Sham Shui Po District and Kowloon City District.

The name of this area is rarely used in day-to-day life. Areas that belong to New Kowloon are usually referred to as part of Kowloon. However, in land leases, it is common to refer to land lots in lot numbers as &quot;New Kowloon Inland Lot number #&quot;.

==History==

By the Convention of Peking in 1860, the territory of British-owned Kowloon was defined as area in Kowloon Peninsula south of a line which later became Boundary Street (known as Kowloon, inclusive of Stonecutter&#x27;s Island), which was ceded by the Qing Empire (Ch&#x27;ing Empire, Manchu Empire) to the United Kingdom under the Convention.

On the other hand, the territory north of Boundary Street (later known as New Kowloon) remained part of Qing Empire until it was leased as part of the New Territories to the UK in 1898 for 99 years under the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory (also known as the Second Convention of Peking). The area of New Kowloon was defined in statutory law first in November 1900 (and referred to as such) and again in December 1937 For most part the northern boundary of the area was defined by the 500 feet (152 metres) contour. In practice, nevertheless, both the areas to the south and to the north of Boundary Street (i.e. both Kowloon and New Kowloon), from the Lei Yue Mun strait in the east to Mei Foo Sun Chuen and Lai Chi Kok Bay in the west, are collectively known as &quot;Kowloon&quot;. For example, a postal address in Kwun Tong will identify &quot;Kowloon&quot; as its regional destination, even though it is technically in New Kowloon and not part of Kowloon as statutorily defined.

==Current situation==
In modern-day conversations, the term &quot;New Kowloon&quot; is now rarely heard in Hong Kong. New Kowloon is no longer regarded as part of the New Territories, but as a part of the Kowloon urban area beyond Boundary Street. Nevertheless, the legal definitions of Kowloon, New Kowloon and New Territories remain unchanged—New Kowloon has remained legally part of the New Territories instead of Kowloon. On 1 July 1997, the territories on both sides of Boundary Street (ceded and leased respectively) were transferred to China, along with the rest of Hong Kong.

However, the designation &quot;New Kowloon&quot; still has some legal implications. Almost all lands of Hong Kong are government land (known as crown land in Commonwealth countries and before 1997 in Hong Kong), while all crown leases (now known as government leases in Hong Kong) of New Kowloon and New Territories lands had been expired on 27 June 1997, but automatically extended up to 30 June 2047 due to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This renewal implies that, all privately owned land leases of New Kowloon, has to pay government rent (crownrent in Commonwealth countries) as leases in the rest of the New Territories, and unlike the rest of the Kowloon. Most Kowloon land leases (Kowloon south of the Boundary Street) are not required to pay the government rent to the government, unless they are new leases, or are old leases having been renewed and such clauses have been inserted in the renewed lease contract.

The land reclaimed from the Kowloon Bay water body, such as Kai Tak, are also referred as part of New Kowloon in land leases, although these lots do not appear to be included in the 1937 map.

<doc id="1092237" wikidata="Q6452728" url="?curid=1092237" title="Nemo dat quod non habet">
<text>Nemo dat quod non habet, literally meaning &quot;no one can give what they do not have&quot;, is a legal rule, sometimes called the &quot;nemo dat&quot; rule, that states that the purchase of a possession from someone who has no ownership right to it also denies the purchaser any ownership title. It is equivalent to the civil (continental) &quot;Nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet&quot; rule, which means &quot;one cannot transfer to another more rights than they have&quot;. The rule usually stays valid even if the purchaser does not know that the seller has no right to claim ownership of the object of the transaction (a &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser); however, in many cases, more than one innocent party is involved, making judgment difficult for courts and leading to numerous exceptions to the general rule that aim to give a degree of protection to &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers and original owners. The possession of the good of title will be with the original owner.

==United States==
In American law, a &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser who unknowingly purchases and subsequently sells stolen goods will, at common law, be held liable in trover for the full market value of those goods as of the date of conversion. Since the true owner retains legal title, the seller is liable even in a chain of successive &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers (i.e., the true owner can successfully sue the fifth &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser in trover). However, the problem of successive &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers can be remedied: If the jurisdiction recognises an implied warranty that the seller has title to the property (such as under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)), then the &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser can sue the seller for breach of that implied warranty. Courts of equity traditionally also recognise various other exceptions, likely giving rise to the idea embodied in the modern UCC.

This rule is exemplified in circumstances like the Holocaust reconciliation movement, where property, such as works of art, stolen or confiscated by the Nazis was returned to the families of the original owners. Anyone who purchased the art or thought they had ownership was denied any rights over the litigious property due to the &quot;nemo dat&quot; rule.

As mentioned earlier, the &quot;nemo dat&quot; rule has numerous exceptions. Legal tender, for example, does not adhere to the rule in certain circumstances. For example, if a rogue buys goods from a &quot;bona fide&quot; merchant, then that merchant will not have to return the bills to the true owner because holding the rule to be otherwise would disrupt the economy and prevent the free flow of goods. The same may be true of other &quot;negotiable&quot; instruments like cheques. If Alice, a thief, steals a cheque from Bob and sells it to innocent Charlie, then Charlie is entitled to deal with the cheque, and Bob cannot claim it back from Charlie (though the name appearing on the cheque may affect the validity of such a transfer).

Another matter is the transfer of other legal rights normally granted by ownership. In 2011, a US District judge ruled that a woman who had purchased a stolen laptop could sue a device tracking company for invasion of privacy stemming from recording software installed on the laptop to facilitate its recovery after being stolen. This ruling demonstrated that &quot;bona fide&quot; purchasers are entitled to some rights by virtue of possession alone, or that &quot;nemo dat&quot; is superseded by the &quot;bona fide&quot; purchaser&#x27;s right to privacy.

==Recording statutes==

When dealing with real property, most American jurisdictions have codified recording statutes that will enable subsequent purchasers to divest title from the party with common law title if they qualify for protection under the recording statute. Three varieties of recording statutes exist: 1) race statutes, 2) notice statutes, and 3) race-notice statutes.

A race statute will divest common law title from a person with superior title if the subsequent purchaser recorded their deed prior to the person with superior title. A notice statute will divest common law title from a person with superior title if the subsequent purchaser had no notice (either actual or constructive – otherwise known as &quot;bona fide&quot;) of the true owner&#x27;s title. A race-notice statute requires a subsequent purchaser to be &quot;bona fide&quot; and record first.

==English law==

The original owner can obtain protection against the former owner through the doctrine of estoppel (see also, s 21(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 &quot;unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller&#x27;s authority to sell&quot;). Methods of the estoppel can be by words, by conduct, or by negligence.

Estoppel by words, or representation by the original owner through words that he is the true owner or has the owner&#x27;s authority to sell:

*&quot;Henderson &amp; Co v Williams&quot; [1895] 1 QB 521
*&quot;Shaw v Commissioner of Metropolitan Police&quot; [1987] 1 WLR 1332, following &quot;Henderson&quot;

Estoppel by conduct:
*&quot;Farquharson Bros v C King &amp; Co Ltd&quot; [1902] AC 325
*&quot;Mercantile Bank of India Ltd v Central Bank of India&quot; [1938] AC 287, upholding &quot;Farquharson&quot;
*&quot;Central Newbury Car Auctions Ltd v Unity Finance Ltd&quot; [1957] 1 QB 371

*&quot;Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson&quot; [2003] UKHL 62

===Exceptions===

====Sales in open markets====

In the eighteenth century at the time of William Blackstone, sales in an open market were an exception to the &quot;nemo dat&quot; principle in English law.

However, after the growth in the UK of car boot sales led to opportunities for rogues to &quot;fence&quot; stolen property, the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1994 abolished the &quot;market overt&quot; exception to the &quot;nemo dat&quot; rule in 1995.

== Scots law ==

As in the United States, banknotes in Scotland are an exception to the rule. This issue arose in the 1749 case of &quot;Crawfurd v The Royal Bank&quot;, where title to a banknote issued by the Bank of Scotland that had gone missing in the post and found in the possession of the Royal Bank of Scotland was disputed.

<text>Ussuri Cossack Host () was a Cossack Host in Imperial Russia, located in Primorye south of Khabarovsk along the Ussuri River, the Sungari River, and around the Khanka Lake.

==History==

The Ussuri Cossack Host was created in 1889 on the basis of an unmounted half-battalion of the Amur Cossack Host and later reinforced with settlers from the Don Cossack Host, Kuban Cossack Host, and other Cossack hosts. The Ussuri Cossack Host headquarters was first located in Vladivostok and then in Iman (now Dalnerechensk). Its nakazny ataman (who was also the military governor of the region) subordinated to the Governor General of the Amur region, who, in turn, was the nakazny ataman of the Amur and the Ussuri Cossack Hosts.

==Organisation and role==

The Ussuri Cossacks possessed 6740 km² of land. In 1916, they numbered 39,900 people in six stanitsas, which comprised 76 settlements. In times of peace, the Ussuri Cossacks supplied one cavalry battalion (300 men) and one platoon. The Ussuri Cossack Host was used for border patrol, postal and police service. It participated in the Russo-Japanese War. During the World War I, the Ussuri Cossacks supplied one cavalry regiment (600 men), one cavalry battalion, one platoon of guards, and six special sotnyas (a total of 2,514 men). Most of the Ussuri Cossack Host took the side of the White movement during the Russian Civil War. The majority of Cossacks joined Ataman Ivan Kalmykov’s Cossack detachment, whilst the other’s joined Ataman Semyonov’s OMO (Special Manchurian Detachment).

==Modern==

The Ussuri Cossack Host was disbanded in 1922. It was re-established in 1990, although not as an administrative unit of any sort.

==Distinctions==

The distinguishing colour of the Ussuri Cossack Host was yellow. This was the color of the cap bands, epaulettes and wide trouser stripes of a green uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to all the Steppe Cossack Hosts. Individual regiments were distinguished by numbers on the epaulettes. Lambs-wool hats (&quot;papakha&quot;) were worn on occasion with yellow cloth tops. From 1907 on, light khaki blouses (&quot;Gymnastyorka|gimnasterka&quot;) summer blouses were adopted to replace the white shirt-tunics previously worn. The blue/grey breeches with yellow stripes continued to be worn through World War I.

<text>The area known as Rózsadomb (, ) is a wealthy area in the 2nd district of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. It is a member of the Buda Hills. 
==Background==

Rózsadomb is part of the 2nd district of Budapest, in the Buda Hills, one of the most prestigious areas in Hungary. Most of the city&#x27;s wealthiest and most famous residents live here (e.g. former prime minister Gordon Bajnai). House prices are amongst the highest in Hungary. The area has easy access to local parks and the forests and hills around the Buda area, while also reasonably near the downtown area. Although it is mostly covered with exclusive villas, many old, dilapidated buildings can also be found here, remaining from the pre-war era.

Although Rózsadomb officially refers only to a relatively small part of the city, in broader sense other hilly and prominent parts of the 2nd district such as Vérhalom, Zöldmál, Rézmál, Csatárka, Szemlőhegy, Törökvész, Felhévíz or Nyék are very often treated as parts of the Rózsadomb, whereas Pasarét (a luxurious but flat part of the district directly next to Rózsadomb) is treated differently.

During the Turkish occupation of Hungary, most of the Turks lived in this neighbourhood. There are many urban myths about them planting roses on these hills. There are several Turkish related sights on Rose Hill, including the Turbe (tomb) of the famous Bektash dervish and poet, Gül Baba in Mecset street. This monument in Budapest was handed back to Turkey after some lobbying by the orientalist Gyula Germanus in the 1960s.

<doc id="1092282" wikidata="Q1974275" url="?curid=1092282" title="Negative frequency">
<text>In mathematics, the concept of signed frequency (negative and positive frequency) can indicate both the rate and sense of rotation; it can be as simple as a wheel rotating clockwise or counterclockwise. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. &quot;cycles&quot;) per second (hertz) or radian/second (where 1 cycle corresponds to 2&quot;π&quot; radians). 

Example: Mathematically, the vector formula_1 has a positive frequency of +1 radian per unit of time and rotates counterclockwise around a unit circle, while the vector formula_2 has a negative frequency of -1 radian per unit of time, which rotates clockwise instead.

==Sinusoids==
Let be an angular frequency with units of radians/second. Then the function has slope , which is called a negative frequency. But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from . Similarly, is indistinguishable from . Thus any sinusoid can be represented in terms of a positive frequency. The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because leads by  cycle (i.e.  radians) when , and lags by  cycle when . Similarly, a vector, , rotates counter-clockwise if , and clockwise if . Therefore, the sign of formula_3 is also preserved in the complex-valued function:
whose corollary is:

In the second term is an addition to formula_4 that resolves the ambiguity. In the second term looks like an addition, but it is actually a cancellation that reduces a 2-dimensional vector to just one dimension, resulting in the ambiguity. also shows why the Fourier transform has responses at both formula_5 even though formula_3 can have only one sign. What the false response does is enable the inverse transform to distinguish between a real-valued function and a complex one.

==Applications==

=== Simplifying the Fourier transform ===
Perhaps the best-known application of negative frequency is the formula:

:formula_7

which is a measure of the energy in function formula_8 at frequency formula_9 When evaluated for a continuum of argument formula_10 the result is called the Fourier transform.

For instance, consider the function:

:formula_11

And:

:formula_12

Note that although most functions do not comprise infinite duration sinusoids, that idealization is a common simplification to facilitate understanding.

Looking at the first term of this result, when formula_13 the negative frequency formula_14 cancels the positive frequency, leaving just the constant coefficient formula_15 (because formula_16), which causes the infinite integral to diverge. At other values of formula_3 the residual oscillations cause the integral to converge to zero. This &quot;idealized&quot; Fourier transform is usually written as:

:formula_18

For realistic durations, the divergences and convergences are less extreme, and smaller non-zero convergences (spectral leakage) appear at many other frequencies, but the concept of negative frequency still applies. Fourier&#x27;s original formulation (the sine transform and the cosine transform) requires an integral for the cosine and another for the sine. And the resultant trigonometric expressions are often less tractable than complex exponential expressions. (see Analytic signal, , and Phasor)

<text>The Chevrolet Tracker, formerly the Geo Tracker, is a mini SUV produced for Chevrolet and Geo by CAMI Automotive in Ingersoll, Ontario. The Tracker was produced under many brands in several different editions and in many countries.

==First generation==

The Geo Tracker was a mini SUV introduced in late 1988 as a 1989 model. It was developed by CAMI which was a joint venture between General Motors of Canada and Suzuki. North American models were to be built in CAMI&#x27;s Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada plant alongside its almost identical twin, the domestic-built Suzuki Sidekick (Escudo). Nearly all 1989 and some 1990 Trackers were built in Japan and imported to the US because of delays at the CAMI factory in Canada. In late 1989, production began in Ingersoll with about 6,100 Geo Trackers finished, with annual production projected to be around 200,000 units. In the beginning, all Canadian-made Trackers were sent to the United States to circumvent the 25 percent Chicken Tax; the Canadian market was supplied entirely from Japan. Suzuki Sidekicks were added to the production line during 1990.

The Tracker was originally powered by Suzuki&#x27;s 1.6L SOHC four-cylinder engine producing . The trim levels in 1989 were base convertible, base two-door hardtop, two-door XL bed, and LSi hardtop. LSi equipment included air conditioner, chrome rally wheels, intermittent wipers, rear window wiper/washer, spare tire cover, three-speed GM Turbo-Hydramatic 180 automatic transmission, tinted glass, and special red/black front and rear bucket seats. In 1990 the LSi trim was made available on the convertible models also. All Trackers were four-wheel drive until a base two-wheel drive convertible was introduced in 1992. The two-door hardtop models were available until 1995 when they were discontinued to make way for the four-door hardtop wagon that was to be introduced the following year. The two-door XL bed was a North America only edition which came with four more inches in the rear and a sealed two door cab. Although Suzuki started importing four-door Sidekicks in 1991, CAMI did not start producing them until the 1996 model year, when America got a four-door Geo Tracker, now powered by Suzuki&#x27;s G16B 16-valve 1.6L boasting . In 1997, the Geo nameplate was merged back into Chevrolet and all Geo models, including the Tracker, Tracker XL, and all subsequent editions were rebadged as Chevrolet in 1998.

The Tracker was different from most other light SUVs on the market in that it is based on a rugged light-truck chassis and certified as a light truck. Although it appeared to be a comfortable passenger SUV, it was bolstered by a sturdy off-road four-wheel-drive system with a conventional light truck engine and transmission coupled to a hi-lo, 2-4 transfer case. The Tracker had a strong front suspension with a rugged recirculating ball steering box. The conventional front differential was rigidly mounted ahead of the engine, with CV axles connecting the coil-spring front hubs to the differential case. The rear axle was a conventional light truck unit on coil springs. As a result of the truck-like underpinnings, the Tracker had a fairly truck-like ride, but the benefit was its notable durability in harsh conditions.

The production of the first-generation model of the Tracker (and Sidekick) came to an end in Ontario after 1998 in order to make way for the second generation of Tracker/Vitara. However, the first generation Sidekick continued in production in other countries until 2004.

===Canada===

When the Geo Tracker was introduced in the United States, the Geo brand was not available in Canada. Because of this the Tracker was introduced there as both the Chevrolet Tracker and the GMC Tracker. The Chevrolet Tracker was sold at Chevrolet dealerships in Canada starting in 1989. Initially there were three models: a base convertible, base hardtop and a CL hardtop (CL is equivalent to the LSi in the Geo line). In 1990 a CL convertible was added to the line-up. 1991 was the last year for the Chevrolet Tracker as the Geo marque was brought to Canada in 1992 and all Chevrolet Trackers were renamed Geo Trackers, yet they continued to display the Chevrolet &quot;bowtie&quot; symbol on the front grille emblem until the end of production in 1998. All 1989–1990 Chevrolet Trackers were four-wheel drive. From 1991 on, the Geo Tracker sold in Canada was identical to its US counterpart. The GMC Tracker was also introduced for the 1989 model year to be sold at Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealerships in Canada. Just like the Chevrolet and Geo initially there were three models: base convertible, base hardtop and SLE hardtop (SLE being equipped the same as the CL and LSi of the other marques). In 1990 an SLE convertible was added to the lineup. 1991 was the last year for the GMC Tracker as GM introduced the Asüna marque in 1992 and the GMC Tracker was renamed the Asüna Sunrunner. The Sunrunner was marketed as more upmarket and had no base model, with all of the Sunrunners being equipped like the SLEs were. The Asüna brand did not last long though, and after only two years (1992 and 1993) the Sunrunner was rebranded as a Pontiac. The Pontiac Sunrunner was sold in Canada from 1994 to 1998 in both base and top-of-the-line GT trim. It was available in two- and four-wheel drive and in both convertible and hardtop body-styles. While the Geo Tracker was also sold as a four-door wagon beginning in 1996, the Sunrunner never got this body style. The Sunrunner was discontinued without a direct replacement in 1998.
==Second generation==
In 1999, the Sidekick was discontinued, and a second generation Tracker was introduced, differing from the Sidekick&#x27;s successor, the Grand Vitara. A Suzuki version of this North American-exclusive Tracker was sold in the North American market as a Suzuki Vitara, which is shorter than the Grand Vitara. In Mexico, the second-generation Tracker remained in production and was sold there as Chevrolet Tracker. The Tracker series was discontinued in the United States and Canada in 2004, but all models including the LJ80/Jimny are still in production in other Suzuki plants. Some Trackers and Sidekicks were made at a Suzuki plant in Kosai, Japan.

The later (1999 and up) Tracker models reverted to a lightweight automobile-type rack and pinion steering, and thus unpopular with rural and off-road users since the rack and pinion is easily damaged. The 1st generation Tracker was sold as the Chevrolet Vitara in Latin America, and the 2nd generation Tracker is sold as the Chevrolet Grand Vitara in Latin American countries. In North America, the first generation Tracker was sold as a Chevrolet in 1998 after GM discontinued the Geo brand. In Latin America, GM made the Suzuki Vitara/Grand Vitara and sold it as Chevrolet Vitara/Grand Vitara (Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela produced in GM Ecuador) or Suzuki Grand Vitara (Argentina) and Chevrolet Tracker (Brazil and Mexico) - both produced by GM Argentina.
On January 27, 2004, production of the Chevrolet Tracker was discontinued at the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, and replaced with the Chevrolet Equinox.

==Markets==

===Mexico===

Geo Tracker was sold since 1994 (Imported from Canada) three-door soft top 4WD or 2WD, automatic or manual transmissions. In 1996 Geo Tracker was dropped, and back 1998 from Canada as Chevrolet Tracker three-door soft top or five-door hard top available in 2WD or 4WD automatic or manual. In 2000, a new generation Chevrolet Tracker was available as a three-door soft top or five-door hard top 2WD or 4WD, manual or automatic; in 2001 the soft top was dropped. The V6 option with 2WD or 4WD automatic was available from 2002 to 2004. Even though the Tracker was discontinued in the U.S. and Canada, the Tracker continued sales in Mexico and Brazil imported from Argentina, although the model was face-lifted in 2005 from Suzuki Grand Vitara. For the 2006 model year, the silver GM logo was added on the front doors. The Tracker was replaced in the summer of 2008 by the Saturn Vue in the U.S. and Canada (Chevrolet Captiva Sport in Mexico).

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, General Motors introduced the Tracker in late 1999, sold alongside the related Suzuki Grand Vitara. Imported from Canada, it was powered by Suzuki&#x27;s 2.0 L J20A four-cylinder engine coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment included a leather wrapped steering wheel, power seats with lumbar support (driver side only), 4-speaker infotainment system with CD playback, rear seats, and central locking. Some were also equipped with spare tires at the back. Due to low sales, GM pulled the Tracker from the market in 2001.

===Brazil===

First-generation Geo Trackers made in Canada were never offered by GM officially. Still, private importers brought them to the country, even though Suzuki brought the Suzuki Vitara from Japan. Private importers also brought to the country soft-top and four-door Sidekicks made in Canada.

For the second generation, it became initially available in the country in 2001, with only a diesel engine and four-door body style. Suzuki also offered the Grand Vitara at the time, with more engine choices and also a two-door hardtop and the XL-7. As the dollar soared, Suzuki left the Brazilian market in 2003.

Even though the Tracker was discontinued in the U.S. and Canada, the Tracker continued sales in Mexico and Brazil, although the model received a facelift in 2005. For the 2006 model year, the silver GM logo was added on the front doors. The Tracker was finally replaced by the 4-cylinder versions of the already introduced Chevrolet Captiva Sport (Saturn Vue in the U.S. and Canada, even though the Vue and Captiva are both built in Mexico) in the summer of 2008.
==Safety report==
According to a 1995 report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 1991–1993 two-wheel drive Geo Tracker had 21 driver fatalities for 66,210 registered vehicles, the highest incidence reported, at 3.2 per 10,000 vehicles. The 4x4 version, however, reported 48 driver fatalities for 271,355 registered vehicles (1.8 per 10,000). The IIHS states that the small utility class had a total of 366 driver fatalities for 2,144,891 total registered vehicles (1.6 per 10,000). This study was widely criticized for faulty comparisons. For example, this study does not note the difference between two-door models and four-door models. A later IIHS study clearly shows that, while two-door Trackers have a slightly below-average injury rate, the four-door models are &quot;better&quot; than the average for utility vehicles.

==Rebadged Chevrolet Trax==

The Chevrolet Trax was sold in Russia and South America as the Tracker. In Russia, the name &quot;Trax&quot; would be too closely related to the word (Rus. ), which is a colloquialism for copulation.

<doc id="1092287" wikidata="Q3241863" url="?curid=1092287" title="Geo Prizm">
<text>The Geo Prizm and Chevrolet Prizm were compact cars that were rebadged versions of the Toyota Sprinter, a vehicle that the Japanese automaker Toyota never directly sold in the North American market. The Sprinter itself was derived from the Toyota Corolla. The Prizm was marketed under the Geo nameplate until it was discontinued after the 1997 model year. After that, the vehicle was marketed under the Chevrolet nameplate. General Motors (GM) referred to this and other Toyota Corolla derived vehicles as the GM S platform. The cars were produced from 1988 to 2001 (the last ones being sold for model year 2002) alongside the Corolla at NUMMI, an assembly plant operated as a joint venture of GM and Toyota. The Prizm was sold exclusively in the United States and succeeded the 1985–1988 Chevrolet Nova, which was also derived from the Sprinter and produced at NUMMI.


==Production==
All Prizms were built at NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.), a joint venture company between Toyota and General Motors in Fremont, California. The NUMMI plant at Fremont had manufactured the Prizm&#x27;s predecessor, the Chevrolet Nova, and would later manufacture the Pontiac Vibe, one of its replacements.

Production of the newly-rebadged Chevrolet Prizm began in late 1997 as the Geo brand was phased out, alongside the newest North American generation of the Toyota Corolla. The last Prizm was built on December 13, 2001, resulting in a brief 2002 model year.
==First generation (E90)==
The Prizm was introduced in February 1989 for GM&#x27;s then-new Geo brand of import cars, for the 1990 model year. The hatchback version sold through 1991 was a rebadged version of the Toyota Sprinter Cielo, although unlike the Sprinter (and Corolla liftback) it received the same front clip as the sedan. The sporty GSi model of 1990–1992 was notable for its twin-cam engine, sport suspension, disc brakes, and 14-inch wheels, which made it as a spiritual successor to the 1988 Chevrolet Nova twin-cam but less of a limited edition, available in both body styles and a full array of colors compared to the earlier model&#x27;s black-only color and sedan-only body style. They were the only four-door models offered with the 4A-GE engine in America; no other Toyota models ever offered that combination there. The regular engine offered . In addition to the base and the GSi, there was also a better equipped standard-engine LSi model. In addition to more equipment, the LSi also received body colored bumpers.

In 1991, the lettering of the car&#x27;s name was changed, and the B-pillar and door frames on base models were body-colored instead of black. The hatchback body style was dropped.

The Prizm was not sold In Canada, with GM offering a sedan version of the Geo Metro instead. The Geo Metro sedan was not available from Chevrolet dealers in the United States until 1995, although a Suzuki Swift-branded version was on sale from 1990.

Design patents were filed by the Toyota Motor Corporation on December 6, 1985, using a final design 1:1 representation, under application number 1985-051078 and registered on July 13, 1988, under registration number 0718088-005.

==Second generation (E100)==
The Prizm&#x27;s second generation, and the last under the Geo brand name, debuted in 1992 for the 1993 model year. The Prizm gained more room (resulting in an upgrade to United States Environmental Protection Agency &quot;compact&quot; car status), a driver&#x27;s-side airbag, and a new 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine optional on LSi trim. With the larger engine came a rear stabilizer bar, wider tires, and an optional automatic transmission with four speeds instead of three. A second airbag became standard in 1993 for the 1994 model year; leather seats were an option on the LSi of this generation. In contrast with the Sprinters sold in Japan, this generation Prizm lacked a front stabilizer bar in its suspension.

U.S. Electricar used the Prizm as the basis for an electric vehicle conversion that replaced the gasoline drivetrain with an electric traction motor and high-voltage lead-acid storage battery. It was marketed in 1994.

==Third generation (E110)==


The Prizm&#x27;s 1998 redesign coincided with the conversion of all remaining Geo models into Chevrolets, as General Motors made the decision to discontinue the Geo brand entirely after 1997.

The most notable change was an all-new 1.8-liter engine known as the 1ZZ-FE, which powered all Corollas and Prizms, making this generation lighter than its predecessor. It is all-aluminum, driven by a timing chain (instead of a timing belt), and making more power (with the same fuel economy) than with the A-series engines from the Geo era. This new engine incorporated laser etched valve guides directly in the cylinder head, rather than the old shrink-to-fit valve guides in the preceding Corolla motors (4A-FE &amp; 7A-FE). This prevents oil burning and valve guide failure in the future. Although these efforts theoretically would have decreased oil burn, a flawed piston ring design affected all engines without VVT-i. This new engine design, although decreasing oil consumption from some components ultimately caused oil burning in higher mileage examples.

The Prizm, alongside the Corolla, became the first car in the compact class to offer optional side airbags. All 1998 Prizms without the LSi&#x27;s optional handling package (containing a front stabilizer bar) were singled out by Consumer Reports for having sloppy emergency handling; Toyota addressed the problem for 1999 by making the handling package standard. For 2000, the engine gained variable valve timing (VVT-i) for a slight increase in power from . The then-recently introduced VVT-i optimizes cam and valve timing to reduce emissions, and the addition of individual coils for each cylinder helped control spark timing to each individual cylinder.

Due to decreased sales, low popularity, and being in competition with the Chevrolet Cavalier and GM&#x27;s more direct competitor to the Corolla the Saturn S-series, the Prizm was replaced by the Pontiac Vibe starting in 2003. The Vibe was also made in tandem with a Toyota model, the Toyota Matrix, at the NUMMI plant.

The Prizm along with its Geo siblings suffered severe sales loss when the brand denomination changed from Geo to Chevrolet in 1998. The Geo models outsold the rebadged Chevrolets three to one.

==Comparison to Toyota Corolla==
In all three generations, the Prizm was virtually the same car as the Toyota Corolla. It has more similarities with other Toyotas during the time period it was produced than it does to other cars from Geo and Chevrolet. The first and second generation Prizms shared body shells with the Japanese market Toyota Sprinter, the former featuring additional quarter windows in the C-pillars and the latter different doors and door apertures that wrapped upward into the roof; the third generation used the same body as the E110 Corolla sedan.

Its distinctions from the Corolla came down to minor cosmetic differences, a GM Delco radio after 1992, the non-availability of a wagon in all three generations, and the availability of a hatchback for the 1989-1991 model years (the Corolla was not offered as a hatchback in North America during those years).

The third generation Prizm also featured a Delphi air conditioning system instead of the Corolla&#x27;s Denso air conditioning system. The Prizms also used the contemporary Sprinter front end to differentiate them from their Corolla counterparts. The third-generation Prizm headlight, front turn signal, and taillight assemblies were also different, making them notable exceptions in a car that shared almost all of its parts with the Toyota Corolla through each of its model years.

==Engines==
All Prizms are powered by engines from their contemporary Toyota Corolla models:
*1990–1992 Geo Prizms are powered by a &quot;4A-FE&quot; or optional &quot;4A-GE&quot; engine
*1993–1997 Geo Prizms are powered by a &quot;4A-FE&quot; or optional &quot;7A-FE&quot; engine
*1998–2002 Chevrolet Prizms are powered by a &quot;1ZZ-FE&quot; engine, with 2000–2002 models including VVT-i

<doc id="1092291" wikidata="Q5533947" url="?curid=1092291" title="Geo Storm">
<text>The Geo Storm is a sport compact car manufactured by Isuzu that was sold in the United States by Geo from 1990 until 1993. The same vehicles, with minor variations, were sold by Geo in Canada in the 1992 and 1993 model years only. The Storm was intended to be a budget car with the look and feel of a sports car. It was sold in two-door liftback and hatchback forms.

The Geo Storm was a rebadged version of the sporty, second generation Isuzu Impulse minus some of that car&#x27;s more expensive features. The base models were also equipped with a less-powerful SOHC engine. The Storm was sold in Japan as the Gemini Coupé and also as the PA Nero through the Yanase dealerships. The Storm lacked the Impulse&#x27;s Lotus-tuned suspension as well as the Impulse&#x27;s optional turbocharger and all-wheel drive drivetrain. Although they were essentially the same car, sales of the Storm were much stronger than those of the Impulse—indeed, the Storm sold better than most small GM cars of that era. Slow sales of the Isuzu version doomed the Storm. When Isuzu ceased building passenger cars in 1993 due to the effects of the crash of the Japanese Bubble Economy, the Isuzu-made Geo Storm was also discontinued with them. Geo offered no sport coupe replacement for the Storm before the brand was folded into Chevrolet after 1997. As of 2010, there were only 40,300 Storms registered for road use.

The Storm was manufactured at Isuzu&#x27;s main plant in Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan.

== Versions ==
The most common body style for the Storm was a three-door liftback. The 1990 and 1991 liftbacks were produced in two trim packages, but all Storms shared front disc and rear drum brakes and had an anti-sway bar to tighten the front suspension. The base model was priced at $10,390, and the &quot;GSi&quot; was $11,650 .USD


The base model&#x27;s SOHC inline-four engine produced 95 hp (71 kW) and had a 9.1:1 compression ratio. The more powerful 1990–1991 &quot;GSi&quot; used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130 hp (97 kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The &quot;GSi&quot; package also included driving lights, a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with a gear ratio that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model&#x27;s manual transmission.

For 1991 and 1992, customers had the option of purchasing a two-door hatchback body style, also called a wagonback. The base price of the hatchback was $11,450, and it was never offered with the stronger &quot;GSi&quot; engine. The much more popular Storm liftback was marketed as a &quot;coupé&quot;.

In 1992, the Storm was restyled to have a smoother front fascia without the pop-up headlight covers on earlier models. The 1992–93 base models retained the same engine, features, and price that were on the earlier car, with slight interior changes such as different stereos, revised rear speaker locations, and interior trim and upholstery. The GSi version from these years cost considerably more ($13,645–14,560) but this price included a larger 1.8 L 140 hp (104 kW) engine.

Canada received the Storm in 1992; it was offered there in base trim and in up-level GSi &quot;Sport Coupe&quot; models (both available as liftbacks). The more upright &quot;Hatchback&quot; model only came in base trim.

The Japanese were also offered the Geo Storm version of the Piazza, called the Yanase-Isuzu PA Nero, which was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Yanase Co., Ltd. under special arrangement, a dealership that sold GM products in Japan. The Piazza/Impulse was also sold by General Motors Canada as the Asüna Sunfire.

== Performance ==
Modern sport compacts have faster acceleration and better handling, but the performance figures for the Storm were quite respectable for an economical compact car from that era. &quot;Autoweek&quot;&#x27;s 1990 review of the Storm was titled &quot;Slick, Quick And Inexpensive&quot;, and described the car as &quot;a good performer&quot; that &quot;handles better than the average new car.&quot; When &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; compared ten sport compact cars they said the Storm had &quot;the highest skidpad rating (0.85 &quot;g&quot;), sticks like pine tar to the autocross course, is second-quickest through the slalom and stops shorter from than many highly respected sports cars&quot;.

Skid pad test figures ranged from 0.81 &quot;g&quot; to 0.85 &quot;g&quot;, meeting or exceeding those of the Mazda RX-7 convertible. &quot;Sport Compact Car&quot; listed the Storm as number three in their &quot;Top Ten of 1992&quot;. &quot;Hot Rod Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Jeff Smith drove a Geo Storm that was set up for SCCA Super Production racing and declared it to be &quot;every bit as demanding and fun&quot; as racing a Trans-Am series car.

Two different Geo Storm Celebrity Races were held in 1991, the first on July 13 in Des Moines, Iowa, and the second on August 24 in Denver, Colorado. Although they are not the most common type of race cars, modified Storms are still occasionally used to compete in road racing, drag racing and autocross. One of the 2003 entries in the Grassroots Motorsports Challenge was a Storm GSi.

== Reviews ==
The Storm sold well and was popular with owners, despite getting mixed reviews from automotive magazines. The body styling was &quot;mildly controversial&quot;. Kevin Smith of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; used phrases like &quot;Planet Zarkon&quot; and &quot;space-capsulish&quot; to describe the body, which he listed as one of the best and worst features of the Storm. &quot;AutoWeek&quot; said that college-aged people tended to &quot;shower the Storm with attention&quot;, but that baby boomers tended to &quot;think that at best, the Storm is unusual looking, at worst, odd.&quot;

The shape of the body was not the only thing automotive journalists criticized. The engine was described as a &quot;buzzbomb&quot; or &quot;just plain noisy&quot;. A few reviewers disliked the suspension, saying the Storm has &quot;above average body lean and needs more rebound control&quot;. Some complained about the small cargo area, visibility and the absence of headroom for backseat passengers.

Other aspects of the Storm were more popular with magazine test drivers. Many praised the wide power band of the engine. &quot;AutoWeek&quot; said, &quot;It revs quickly and easily. Running up to the 7600 rpm redline can be a delight.&quot; &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; liked the handling, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a delight to negotiate twisty...roads with its firm yet compliant suspension.&quot;

== Year to year changes ==
* 1991: A hatchback (&quot;wagonback&quot;) model was added, other than that, the Storm carried on unchanged.
* 1992: All three models of the Storm received a new headlight cluster (with narrow sealed-beam halogen headlamps also seen in that year&#x27;s Pontiac Grand Prix GTP), tail lights, and front clip. The Storm went on sale in Canada. Base models received a new rear bumper treatment. Instrument panel and gauge graphics were also slightly revised. The GSi version received a new spoiler and a larger DOHC engine which offered 10 extra hp.
* 1993: The hatchback was dropped, and the center console was fitted with a double-DIN radio. The hp rating of the base model dropped from 95 to 90 because of a camshaft redesign to allow more torque, creating a peppier engine.

Overall, there were six versions of the Storm; the early 1990-91 base and GSi liftbacks, 1991 base hatchback, facelifted 1992-93 base and GSi liftbacks, and base 1992 hatchback.

<text>Cantonese () is the traditional prestige variety of Yue Chinese, a Sinitic language belonging to the Sino-Tibetan language family, which has over 85 million native speakers. It originated in the city of Guangzhou (formerly known as Canton) and its surrounding Pearl River Delta. While the term &quot;Cantonese&quot; specifically refers to the prestige variety, in linguistics it has often been used to refer to the entire Yue subgroup of Chinese, including related but partially mutually intelligible varieties like Taishanese.

Cantonese is viewed as a vital and inseparable part of the cultural identity for its native speakers across large swaths of southeastern China, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as in overseas communities. In mainland China, it is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the province of Guangdong (being the majority language of the Pearl River Delta) and neighbouring areas such as Guangxi. It is also the dominant and co-official language of Hong Kong and Macau. Furthermore, Cantonese is widely spoken among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia (most notably in Vietnam and Malaysia, as well as in Singapore and Cambodia to a lesser extent) and the Western world.

Although Cantonese shares much vocabulary with Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese, these Sinitic languages are not mutually intelligible, largely because of phonological differences, but also due to the differences in grammar and vocabulary. Sentence structure, in particular the verb placement, sometimes differs between the two varieties. A notable difference between Cantonese and Mandarin is how the spoken word is written; both can be recorded verbatim, but very few Cantonese speakers are knowledgeable in the full Cantonese written vocabulary, so a non-verbatim formalized written form is adopted, which is more akin to the written Standard Mandarin. However, it is only non-verbatim with respect to vernacular Cantonese as it is possible to read Standard Chinese text verbatim in formal Cantonese, often with only slight changes in lexicon that are optional depending on the reader&#x27;s choice of register. This results in the situation in which a Cantonese and a Mandarin text may look similar but are pronounced differently. Conversely, written (vernacular) Cantonese is mostly used in informal settings like social media and comic books. 

==Names of Cantonese==
In English, the term &quot;Cantonese&quot; can be ambiguous. &quot;Cantonese&quot; as used to refer to the language native to the city of Canton, which is the traditional English name of Guangzhou, was popularized by &quot;An English and Cantonese Pocket Dictionary&quot; (1859), a bestseller by the missionary John Chalmers. Before 1859, this variant was often referred to in English as &quot;the Canton dialect&quot;.

However, &quot;Cantonese&quot; may also refer to the primary branch of Chinese that contains Cantonese proper as well as Taishanese and Gaoyang; this broader usage may be specified as &quot;Yue speech&quot; (). In this article, &quot;Cantonese&quot; is used for Cantonese proper.

Historically, speakers called this variety &quot;Canton speech&quot; (), although this term is now seldom used outside mainland China. In Guangdong and Guangxi, people also call it &quot;provincial capital speech&quot; () or &quot;plain speech&quot; (). In academic linguistic circles, it is also referred to as &quot;Canton prefecture speech&quot; ().

In Hong Kong and Macau, as well as among overseas Chinese communities, the language is referred to as &quot;Guangdong speech&quot; or &quot;Canton Province Speech&quot; () or simply as &quot;Chinese&quot; ().

==History==

During the Southern Song period, Guangzhou became the cultural center of the region. Cantonese emerged as the prestige variety of Yue Chinese when the port city of Guangzhou on the Pearl River Delta became the largest port in China, with a trade network stretching as far as Arabia. Specifically, the mutually intelligible speech of the &quot;Sam Yap&quot; (), the Three Counties of Guangzhou, namely the historical counties of Panyu (), Nanhai (), and Shunde (), came to be heralded as the standard. Cantonese was also used in the popular &quot;Yuè&#x27;ōu&quot;, &quot;Mùyú&quot; and &quot;Nányīn&quot; folksong genres, as well as Cantonese opera. Additionally, a distinct classical literature was developed in Cantonese, with Middle Chinese texts sounding more similar to modern Cantonese than other present-day Chinese varieties, including Mandarin.

As Guangzhou became China&#x27;s key commercial center for foreign trade and exchange in the 1700s, Cantonese became the variety of Chinese interacting most with the Western world. Much of the sources for this period of early Cantonese, such as the 18th century rime dictionary &quot;Fenyun Cuoyao&quot; () and the 1828 &quot;Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect&quot; by the missionary Robert Morrison, were written in Guangzhou during this period. 

After the First Opium War, centuries of maritime prohibitions ended. Large numbers of Cantonese people from the Pearl River Delta, especially merchants, subsequently migrated by boat to other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi. These migrants established enclaves of Cantonese in areas that primarily spoke other forms of Yue or even non-Sinitic languages such as Zhuang, as with the case of the Yong–Xun Yue dialect of Nanning. Many Cantonese migrants sailed also overseas, bringing the Cantonese language with them to Southeast Asia, North and South America, and Western Europe. Such enclaves of Cantonese are still found in Chinatowns across many of these major cities outside China. During the late 19th century, the pedagogical work &quot;Cantonese made easy&quot;, written by James Dyer Ball in 1883, articulated the provenance of the prestige accent of Cantonese: that of the district of Xiguan () in the west of Guangzhou. It is known for its distinctive use of an apical vowel (, or in more conventional IPA: ) in some cases where modern Cantonese would use a final.

Throughout the 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, the ancestors of most of the population of Hong Kong and Macau arrived from Guangzhou and surrounding areas after they were ceded to Britain and Portugal, respectively. The influx of such migrants into Hong Kong established Cantonese as the main language of the colony, supplanting local Yue Chinese varieties, which were closer to the dialects of neighboring Shenzhen and Dongguan, as well as the Hakka and Southern Min varieties of the region. With subsequent waves of migration into Hong Kong, even as late as the 1950s, the proportion of native Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong had not yet surpassed 50%; nonetheless, this figure has risen to above 90% since the 1970s. On the other hand, the indigenous variety of Yue Chinese in Macau had been close to that of Zhongshan, and this has had an effect on the tonal phonology of the Cantonese spoken in Macau.

As a significant proportion of the entertainment industry in China migrated to Hong Kong in the early decades of the 20th century, the Hong Kong-based entertainment industry underwent a transformation to suit overseas as well as domestic audiences. With the bifurcation of the film industry into Cantonese and Mandarin, the use of the Xiguan accent of Guangzhou as a conservative prestige accent of standard Cantonese was maintained in mass media, with films from the 1930s making prominent use of it. However, during this time many phonological changes can be detected, indicating the change from Early Cantonese to Modern Cantonese.

In mainland China, Standard Mandarin has been heavily promoted as the medium of instruction in schools and as the official language, especially after the communist takeover in 1949. Meanwhile, Cantonese has remained the official variety of Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau, both during and after the colonial period, under the policy of &#x27;biliteracy and trilingualism&#x27; (). Government and law still function predominantly in Cantonese in these jurisdictions, and officials speak Cantonese even at the most formal occasions.

==Geographic distribution==
===Hong Kong and Macau===

The official languages of Hong Kong are Chinese and English, as defined in the Hong Kong Basic Law. The Chinese language has many different varieties, of which Cantonese is one. Given the traditional predominance of Cantonese within Hong Kong, it is the &quot;de facto&quot; official spoken form of the Chinese language used in the Hong Kong Government and all courts and tribunals. It is also used as the medium of instruction in schools, alongside English.

A similar situation also exists in neighboring Macau, where Chinese is an official language alongside Portuguese. As in Hong Kong, Cantonese is the predominant spoken variety of Chinese used in everyday life and is thus the official form of Chinese used in the government. The Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong and Macau is mutually intelligible with the Cantonese spoken in the mainland city of Guangzhou, although there exist some minor differences in accent, pronunciation, and vocabulary.

===China===

Cantonese first developed around the port city of Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta region of southeastern China. Due to the city&#x27;s long standing role as an important cultural center, Cantonese emerged as the prestige dialect of the Yue varieties of Chinese in the Southern Song dynasty and its usage spread around most of what is now the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi.

Despite the cession of Macau to Portugal in 1557 and Hong Kong to Britain in 1842, the ethnic Chinese population of the two territories largely originated from the 19th and 20th century immigration from Guangzhou and surrounding areas, making Cantonese the predominant Chinese language in the territories. On the mainland, Cantonese continued to serve as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Guangdong and Guangxi even after Mandarin was made the official language of the government by the Qing dynasty in the early 1900s. Cantonese remained a dominant and influential language in southeastern China until the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 and its promotion of Standard Mandarin Chinese as the sole official language of the nation throughout the last half of the 20th century, although its influence still remains strong within the region.

While the Chinese government encourages the use of Standard Mandarin rather than local varieties of Chinese in broadcasts, Cantonese enjoys a relatively higher standing than other Chinese languages, with its own media and usage in public transportation in Guangdong province. Furthermore, it is also a medium of instruction in select academic curricula, including some university elective courses and Chinese as a foreign language programs. The permitted usage of Cantonese in mainland China is largely a countermeasure against Hong Kong&#x27;s influence, as its Cantonese-language media has a substantial exposure and following in Guangdong.

Nevertheless, the place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious, as with other non-Mandarin Chinese languages. A 2010 proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou television from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following massive public protests, the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. As a major economic center of China, there have been concerns that the use of Cantonese in Guangzhou is diminishing in favour of Mandarin, both through the continual influx of Mandarin-speaking migrants from impoverished areas and strict government policies. As a result, Cantonese is being given a more important status by the natives than ever before as a common identity of the local people. This has led to initiatives to revive the language such as its introduction into school curricula and locally produced programs on broadcast media.

===Southeast Asia===
Cantonese has historically served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, who speak a variety of other forms of Chinese including Hokkien, Teochew, and Hakka. Additionally, Cantonese media and popular culture such as Hong Kong cinema is popular throughout the region.

====Vietnam====

In Vietnam, Cantonese is the dominant language of the main ethnic Chinese community, usually referred to as &quot;Hoa&quot;, which numbers about one million people and constitutes one of the largest minority groups in the country. Over half of the ethnic Chinese population in Vietnam speaks Cantonese as a native language and the variety also serves as a lingua franca between the different Chinese dialect groups. Many speakers reflect their exposure to Vietnamese with a Vietnamese accent or a tendency to code-switch between Cantonese and Vietnamese.

====Malaysia====

In Malaysia, Cantonese is widely spoken among the Malaysian Chinese community in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding areas in the Klang Valley (Petaling Jaya, Ampang, Putrajaya, Cheras, Selayang, Sungai Buloh, Puchong, Shah Alam, Kajang, Bangi, and Subang Jaya). The language is also widely spoken as well in the town of Sekinchan in the district of
Sabak Bernam located in the northern part of Selangor state; the state of Perak, especially in the state capital city of Ipoh and its surrounding towns of Gopeng, Batu Gajah, and Kampar of the Kinta Valley region plus the towns of Tapah and Bidor in the southern part of the Perak state; and most of the state of Negeri Sembilan, especially in the state capital city of Seremban, as well as the towns of Port Dickson, Kuala Pilah, Bahau, Tampin, Rembau and Gemas, with the exception of Jelebu, Mantin, Nilai and Kuala Klawang, where Hokkien and Hakka predominate, respectively. Cantonese is also widely spoken in the eastern Sabahan town of Sandakan as well as the towns of Kuantan, Raub, Bentong, Temerloh, Pekan, Jerantut as well as Cameron Highlands in Pahang state, and they are also found in other areas like Sarikei, Sarawak, and Mersing, Johor.

Although Hokkien is the most natively spoken variety of Chinese and Mandarin is the medium of education at Chinese-language schools, Cantonese is largely influential in the local Chinese media and is used in commerce by Chinese Malaysians.

Due to the popularity of Hong Kong popular culture, especially through drama series and popular music, Cantonese is widely understood by the Chinese in all parts of Malaysia, even though a large proportion of the Chinese Malaysian population is non-Cantonese. Television networks in Malaysia regularly broadcast Hong Kong television programmes in their original Cantonese audio and soundtrack. Cantonese radio is also available in the nation and Cantonese is prevalent in locally produced Chinese television.

Cantonese spoken in Malaysia and Singapore often exhibits influences from Malay and other Chinese varieties spoken in the country, like Hokkien and Teochew.

====Singapore====

The Singapore government uses Mandarin as the official Chinese variety and has a Speak Mandarin Campaign (SMC) seeking to actively promote using Mandarin at the expense of other Chinese varieties. A little over 15% of Chinese households in Singapore speak Cantonese. Despite the government actively promoting SMC, the Cantonese-speaking Chinese community has been relatively successful in preserving its language from Mandarin compared with other dialect groups.

Notably, all nationally produced non-Mandarin Chinese TV and radio programs were stopped after 1979. The prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, then, also stopped giving speeches in Hokkien to prevent giving conflicting signals to the people. Hong Kong (Cantonese) and Taiwanese dramas are unavailable in their untranslated form on free-to-air television, though drama series in non-Chinese languages are available in their original languages. Cantonese drama series on terrestrial TV channels are instead dubbed in Mandarin and broadcast without the original Cantonese audio and soundtrack. However, originals may be available through other sources like cable television and online videos.

Furthermore, an offshoot of SMC is the translation to Hanyu Pinyin of certain terms which originated from southern Chinese varieties. For instance, dim sum is often known as &quot;diǎn xīn&quot; in Singapore&#x27;s English-language media, though this is largely a matter of style, and most Singaporeans will still refer to it as &quot;dim sum&quot; when speaking English.

Nevertheless, since the government restriction on media in non-Mandarin varieties was relaxed in the mid-1990s and 2000s, presence of Cantonese in Singapore has grown substantially. Forms of popular culture from Hong Kong, like television series, cinema and pop music have become popular in Singaporean society, and non-dubbed original versions of the media became widely available. Consequently, the number of non-Cantonese Chinese Singaporeans being able to understand or speak Cantonese to some varying extent is growing, with a number of educational institutes offering Cantonese as an elective language course.

====Cambodia====
Cantonese is widely used as the inter-communal language among Chinese Cambodians, especially in Phnom Penh and other urban areas. While Teochew speakers form the majority of the Chinese population in Cambodia, Cantonese is often used as a vernacular in commerce and with other Chinese variant groups in the nation. Chinese-language schools in Cambodia are conducted in both Cantonese and Mandarin, but schools may be conducted exclusively in one Chinese variant or the other.

====Thailand====
While Thailand is home to the largest overseas Chinese community in the world, the vast majority of ethnic Chinese in the country speak Thai exclusively. Among Chinese-speaking Thai households, Cantonese is the fourth most-spoken Chinese variety after Teochew, Hakka and Hainanese. Nevertheless, within the Thai Chinese commercial sector, it serves as a common language alongside Teochew or Thai. Chinese-language schools in Thailand have also traditionally been conducted in Cantonese. Furthermore, Cantonese serves as the lingua franca with other Chinese communities in the region.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, Cantonese is locally known as &quot;Konghu&quot; and is one of the variants spoken by the Chinese Indonesian community, with speakers largely concentrated in certain major cities like Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, Makassar, Semarang, Manado and Batam. However, it has a relatively minor presence compared to other Southeast Asian nations, being the fourth most spoken Chinese variety after Hokkien, Hakka and Teochew.

===North America===
====United States====

Over a period of 150 years (from 1850 to the 2000s), Guangdong has been the place-of-origin for most Chinese emigrants to Western nations; one coastal county, Taishan (or Tóisàn, where the Sìyì or &quot;sei yap&quot; variety of Yue is spoken), alone may be the origin of the vast majority of Chinese immigrants to the U.S. before 1965. As a result, Yue languages such as Cantonese and the closely related variety of Taishanese have been the major Chinese varieties traditionally spoken in the United States. In 2009, 458,840 Americans spoke Cantonese at home according to an American Community Survey.

The Zhongshan variant of Cantonese, which originated from the western Pearl River Delta, is spoken by many Chinese immigrants in Hawaii, and some in San Francisco and the Sacramento River Delta (see Locke, California). It is a Yuehai variety much like Guangzhou Cantonese but has &quot;flatter&quot; tones. Chinese is the second most widely spoken non-English language in the United States when both Cantonese and Mandarin are combined, behind Spanish. Many institutes of higher education have traditionally had Chinese programs based on Cantonese, with some continuing to offer these programs despite the rise of Mandarin. The most popular romanization for learning Cantonese in the United States is Yale romanization.

The majority of Chinese emigrants have traditionally originated from Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as Hong Kong and Macau (beginning in the latter half of the 20th century and before the handover) and Southeast Asia, with Cantonese as their native language. However, more recent immigrants are arriving from the rest of mainland China and Taiwan and most often speak Standard Mandarin (Putonghua) as their native language, although some may also speak their native local variety, such as Shanghainese, Hokkien, Fuzhounese, Hakka, etc. As a result, Mandarin is becoming more common among the Chinese American community.

The increase of Mandarin-speaking communities has resulted in the rise of separate neighborhoods or enclaves segregated by the primary Chinese variety spoken. Socioeconomic statuses are also a factor. For example, in New York City, Cantonese still predominates in the city&#x27;s older, traditional western portion of Chinatown in Manhattan and in Brooklyn&#x27;s small new Chinatowns in Bensonhurst and Homecrest. The newly emerged Little Fuzhou eastern portion of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and Brooklyn&#x27;s main large Chinatown in and around Sunset Park are mostly populated by Fuzhounese speakers, who often speak Mandarin as well. The Cantonese and Fuzhounese enclaves in New York City are more working class. However, due to the rapid gentrification of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown and with NYC&#x27;s Cantonese and Fuzhou populations now increasingly shifting to other Chinese enclaves in the Outer Boroughs of NYC, such as Brooklyn and Queens, but mainly in Brooklyn&#x27;s newer Chinatowns, the Cantonese speaking population in NYC is now increasingly concentrated in Bensonhurst&#x27;s Little Hong Kong/Guangdong and Homecrest&#x27;s Little Hong Kong/Guangdong. The Fuzhou population of NYC is becoming increasingly concentrated in Brooklyn&#x27;s Sunset Park, also known as Little Fuzhou, which is causing the city&#x27;s growing Cantonese and Fuzhou enclaves to become increasingly distanced and isolated from both each other and other Chinese enclaves in Queens. Flushing&#x27;s Chinatown, which is now the largest Chinatown in the city, and Elmhurst&#x27;s smaller Chinatown in Queens are very diverse, with large numbers of Mandarin speakers from different regions of China and Taiwan. The Chinatowns of Queens comprise the primary cultural center for New York City&#x27;s Chinese population and are more middle class.

In Northern California, especially the San Francisco Bay Area, Cantonese has historically dominated in the Chinatowns of San Francisco and Oakland, as well as the surrounding suburbs and metropolitan area, although since the late 2000s a concentration of Mandarin speakers has formed in Silicon Valley. In contrast, Southern California hosts a much larger Mandarin-speaking population, with Cantonese found in more historical Chinese communities such as that of Chinatown, Los Angeles, and older Chinese ethnoburbs such as San Gabriel, Rosemead, and Temple City. Mandarin predominates in much of the emergent Chinese American enclaves in eastern Los Angeles County and other areas of the metropolitan region.

While a number of more-established Taiwanese immigrants have learned Cantonese to foster relations with the traditional Cantonese-speaking Chinese American population, more recent arrivals and the larger number of mainland Chinese immigrants have largely continued to use Mandarin as the exclusive variety of Chinese. This has led to a linguistic discrimination that has also contributed to social conflicts between the two sides, with a growing number of Chinese Americans (including American-born Chinese) of Cantonese background defending the historic Chinese-American culture against the impacts of increasing Mandarin-speaking new arrivals.

====Canada====
Cantonese is the most common Chinese variety spoken among Chinese Canadians. According to the Canada 2016 census, there were 565,275 Canadian residents who reported Cantonese as their native language. Among the self-reported Cantonese speakers, 44% were born in Hong Kong, 27% were born in Guangdong Province in China, and 18% were Canadian-born. Cantonese-speakers can be found in every city with a Chinese community. The majority of Cantonese-speakers in Canada live in the Greater Toronto Area and Metro Vancouver. There are sufficient Cantonese-speakers in Canada that there exist locally produced Cantonese TV and radio programming, such as Fairchild TV.

As in the United States, the Chinese Canadian community traces its roots to early immigrants from Guangdong during the latter half of the 19th century. Later Chinese immigrants came from Hong Kong in two waves, first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, and again in the 1980s to late 1990s on fears arising from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and impending handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Chinese-speaking immigrants from conflict zones in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, arrived as well, beginning in the mid-1970s and were also largely Cantonese-speaking.

===Western Europe===
====United Kingdom====
The overwhelming majority of Chinese speakers in the United Kingdom use Cantonese, with about 300,000 British people claiming it as their first language. This is largely due to the presence of British Hong Kongers and the fact that many British Chinese also have origins in the former British colonies in Southeast Asia of Singapore and Malaysia.

====France====
Among the Chinese community in France, Cantonese is spoken by immigrants who fled the former French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) following the conflicts and communist takeovers in the region during the 1970s. While a slight majority of ethnic Chinese from Indochina speak Teochew at home, knowledge of Cantonese is prevalent due to its historic prestige status in the region and is used for commercial and community purposes between the different Chinese variety groups. As in the United States, there is a divide between Cantonese-speakers and those speaking other mainland Chinese varieties.

====Portugal====
Cantonese is spoken by ethnic Chinese in Portugal who originate from Macau, the most established Chinese community in the nation with a presence dating back to the 16th century and Portuguese colonialism. Since the late-20th century, however, Mandarin- and Wu-speaking migrants from mainland China have outnumbered those from Macau, although Cantonese is still retained among mainstream Chinese community associations.

===Australia===
Cantonese was the dominant Chinese language of the Chinese Australian community from the time the first ethnic Chinese settlers arrived in the 1850s until the mid-2000s, when a heavy increase in immigration from Mandarin-speakers largely from mainland China led to Mandarin surpassing Cantonese as the dominant Chinese dialect spoken. Cantonese is the third most-spoken language in Australia. In the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics listed 336,410 and 263,673 speakers of Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively. By 2016, those numbers became 596,711 and 280,943.

==Cultural role==
Spoken Chinese exhibits a multitude of regional and local varieties, many of which are mutually unintelligible. The majority of these varieties are not widely spoken outside of their native regions, although they may be encountered in other parts of the world. Additionally, numerous varieties possess both literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters for newer standard reading sounds. Since a 1909 decree of the Qing dynasty, the government of China has promoted Mandarin for use in education, the media, and official communications. However, the proclamation of Mandarin as the official national language was not fully accepted by the Cantonese authorities in the early 20th century. Proponents of the regional uniqueness of their local language and the commercial importance of the region argued that Cantonese should be preserved. In contrast to other non-Mandarin Chinese varieties, Cantonese persists in a few state television and radio broadcasts today.

Nevertheless, there have been recent efforts to reduce the use of Cantonese in China. The most notable of these has been the 2010 proposal put forth by Guangzhou Television, which called for an increase in Mandarin broadcasts at the expense of Cantonese programmes. This, however, resulted in protests in Guangzhou, which ultimately dissuaded the authorities from pursuing the proposal. Furthermore, there are reports of students being punished for speaking other Chinese languages at school, which has led to a reluctance among younger children to communicate in their native languages, including Cantonese. Such actions have further provoked Cantonese speakers to cherish their linguistic identity in contrast to migrants who have generally arrived from poorer areas of China and largely speak Mandarin or other Chinese languages.

Due to the linguistic history of Hong Kong and Macau, and the use of Cantonese in many established overseas Chinese communities, the use of Cantonese is quite widespread compared to the presence of its speakers residing in China. Cantonese is the predominant Chinese variety spoken in Hong Kong and Macau. In these areas, public discourse takes place almost exclusively in Cantonese, making it the only variety of Chinese other than Mandarin to be used as an official language in the world. Because of their dominance in Chinese diaspora overseas, standard Cantonese and its dialect Taishanese are among the most common Chinese languages that one may encounter in the West.

Increasingly since the 1997 handover, Cantonese has been used as a symbol of local identity in Hong Kong, largely through the development of democracy in the territory and desinicization practices to emphasise a separate Hong Kong identity.

A similar identity issue exists in the United States, where conflicts have arisen among Chinese-speakers due to a large recent influx of Mandarin-speakers. While older Taiwanese immigrants have learned Cantonese to foster integration within the traditional Chinese American populations, more recent arrivals from the mainland continue to use Mandarin exclusively. This has contributed to a segregation of communities based on linguistic cleavage. In particular, some Chinese Americans (including American-born Chinese) of Cantonese background emphasise their non-mainland origins (e.g. Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, etc.) to assert their identity in the face of new waves of immigration.

Along with Mandarin and Hokkien, Cantonese has its own popular music, Cantopop, which is the predominant genre in Hong Kong. Many artists from the mainland and Taiwan have learned Cantonese to break into the market. Popular native Mandarin-speaking singers, including Faye Wong, Eric Moo, and singers from Taiwan, have been trained in Cantonese to add &quot;Hong Kong-ness&quot; to their performances.

Cantonese films date to the early days of Chinese cinema, and the first Cantonese talkie, &quot;&quot;, was made in 1932 by the Tianyi Film Company. Despite a ban on Cantonese films by the Nanjing authority in the 1930s, Cantonese film production continued in Hong Kong which was then under British colonial rule. From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, Cantonese films made in Hong Kong were very popular in the Chinese speaking world.

==Phonology==

===Initials and finals===
The de facto standard for Cantonese pronunciation is that of Canton (Guangzhou). While there are some minor phonological variations between Hong Kong Cantonese and standard Guangzhou Cantonese, the two forms are almost identical.

The phonemic systems of Hong Kong and Macau exhibit a tendency to merge certain phoneme pairs. Despite the fact that this phenomenon has been described as a lazy sound/pronunciation () furthermore, this pronunciation is regarded as inferior to that of Guangzhou, and has been prevalent in the territories since the early 20th century. The most notable difference between Hong Kong and Guangzhou pronunciation is substituting liquid nasal for nasal initial in many words. An example is manifested in the word for you (), pronounced as [nei˩˧] in Guangzhou and as [lei˩˧] in Hong Kong.

Another key feature of Hong Kong Cantonese is the two syllabic nasals and merging. This can be exemplified in the elimination of the contrast of sounds between 吳 (Ng, a surname) ([ŋ̩˨˩] in Guangzhou pronunciation) and (not) ([m̩˨˩] in Guangzhou pronunciation). Hong Kong Cantonese pronounce both words as the latter.

Lastly, the initials and are merging into and when followed by . An example is in the word for country (國), pronounced in standard Guangzhou as &quot;[kʷɔk]&quot; but as &quot;[kɔk]&quot; with the merge. Unlike the above two differences, this merge is alongside the standard pronunciation in Hong Kong rather than being replaced. Educated speakers often stick to the standard pronunciation but can exemplify the merged pronunciation in casual speech. In contrast, less educated speakers pronounce the merge more frequently.

Less prevalent, but still notable differences found among a number of Hong Kong speakers include:
*Merging initial into null initial
*Merging and codas into and codas respectively, eliminating contrast between these pairs of finals (except after and ): -, -, -, -, - and -.
*Merging the rising tones ( 2nd and 5th).

Cantonese vowels tend to be traced further back to Middle Chinese than their Mandarin analogues, such as M. /aɪ/ vs. C. /ɔːi/; M. /i/ vs. C. /ɐi/; M. /ɤ/ vs. C. /ɔː/; M. /ɑʊ/ vs. C. /ou/ etc. For consonants, some differences include M. /ɕ, tɕ, tɕʰ/ vs. C. /h, k, kʰ/; M. /ʐ/ vs. C. /j/; and a greater syllable coda diversity in Cantonese (like syllables ending in &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-k&quot;).

===Tones===
Generally speaking, Cantonese is a tonal language with six phonetic tones, two more than the four in Standard Chinese Mandarin. This makes Cantonese in general harder to master due to required ability of users to readily be able to process two additional phonetic tones. People who grew up using Cantonese tones can usually hear the tonal differences with no problem, but adults who were brought up speaking non-tonal languages like English and most Western European languages may not be able to distinguish the tonal differences quick enough to optimally use the language. This difficulty also applies to tonal language speakers with fewer tones attempting to master languages with more tones such as Mandarin natives trying to learn spoken Cantonese as adults. 

Historically, finals that end in a stop consonant were considered as &quot;checked tones&quot; and treated separately by diachronic convention, identifying Cantonese with nine tones (). However, these are seldom counted as phonemic tones in modern linguistics, which prefer to analyse them as conditioned by the following consonant.

==Written Cantonese==

As Cantonese is predominantly utilised in Hong Kong, Macau, and other overseas Chinese communities, it is typically inscribed with traditional Chinese characters. Nevertheless, it incorporates supplementary characters and characters with disparate meanings from written vernacular Chinese, due to the presence of lexical items that are either absent from standard Chinese or correspond with spoken Cantonese. This written Cantonese system frequently manifests in colloquial contexts, such as entertainment magazines, social media, and advertisements.

In contrast, formal literature, professional and government documents, television and movie subtitles, and news media continue to use standard written Chinese. Nevertheless, colloquial characters may be present in formal written communications such as legal testimonies and newspapers when an individual is being quoted, rather than paraphrasing spoken Cantonese into standard written Chinese.

==Romanization==
Systems of Cantonese romanization are based on the accents of Canton and Hong Kong and have helped define the concept of Standard Cantonese. The major systems are (in order of their invention from newest to oldest): Jyutping, the Chinese government&#x27;s Guangdong Romanization, Yale, Meyer–Wempe, and Standard Romanization. Jyutping and Yale are the two most used and taught systems today in the West, and they do not differ greatly from one another except in how they mark tones. Additionally, Hong Kong linguist Sidney Lau modified the Yale system for his popular Cantonese-as-a-second-language course, and his variant is another system in use today.

Hong Kong&#x27;s and Macau&#x27;s governments use systems of romanization for proper names and geographic locations, but they transcribe some sounds inconsistently. These systems are not taught in schools. Macau&#x27;s system differs slightly from Hong Kong&#x27;s in that the spellings are influenced by Portuguese language due to colonial history. For example, while many words in Macau&#x27;s system are the same as Hong Kong&#x27;s (e.g. surnames &quot;Lam&quot; 林, &quot;Chan&quot; 陳), instances of the letter under Hong Kong&#x27;s system are often replaced by in Macau&#x27;s (e.g. &quot;Chau&quot; vs. &quot;Chao&quot; 周, &quot;Leung&quot; vs &quot;Leong&quot; 梁). Neither the spellings of Hong Kong&#x27;s system nor of Macau&#x27;s look very similar to mainland China&#x27;s system called pinyin, chiefly because it distinguishes between Mandarin&#x27;s two series of stops while they, although the pronunciation of Standard Cantonese&#x27;s two series is similar to the Mandarin, do not generally distinguish them, they thus rendering not only /pʰ/, /tʰ/, and so forth, but also /p/, /t/, and the remaining non-aspirates, by the simple spellings , , etc. vs. it rendering the latter series by , , and the like.

===Early Western efforts===
Systematic efforts to develop an alphabetic representation of Cantonese began with Protestant missionaries arriving in China early in the nineteenth century. Romanization was considered both a tool to help new missionaries learn the variety more easily and a quick route for the unlettered to achieve gospel-literacy. Earlier Catholic missionaries, mostly Portuguese, had developed romanization-schemes for the pronunciation current in the court and capital city of China but made few efforts to romanize other varieties.

Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary in China, published a &quot;Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect&quot; (1828) with a rather unsystematic romanized pronunciation. Elijah Coleman Bridgman and Samuel Wells Williams in their &quot;Chinese Chrestomathy in the Canton Dialect&quot; (1841) were the progenitors of a long-lived lineage of related romanizations that with minor variations are embodied in the works of James Dyer Ball, Ernst Johann Eitel, and Immanuel Gottlieb Genähr (1910). Bridgman and Williams based their system on the phonetic alphabet and diacritics proposed by Sir William Jones for South Asian languages.

Their system of romanization embodied the phonological system of a local-dialect rhyme-dictionary, the &quot;Fenyun cuoyao&quot;, which was widely used and easily obtainable at the time and is still available today. Samuel Wells Willams&#x27; &quot;Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect&quot; (&quot;Yinghua fenyun cuoyao&quot;, 1856) is an alphabetic rearrangement, translation, and annotation of this &quot;Fenyun&quot;. To adapt the system to the needs of users in an era when there was no standard, but rather only a range of local variants—although the speech of the western suburbs (Xiguan 西關) of Guangzhou was the prestige variety—Williams suggested that users learn and follow their teacher&#x27;s pronunciation of his chart of Cantonese syllables. It was apparently Bridgman&#x27;s innovation to mark the tones with (for the upper-register ones) open circles vs. (for the lower-register tones) underlined open circles, in either case at the four corners of the romanized word in analogy with the traditional Chinese system of marking the tone of a character with a circle (lower left for &quot;even&quot;, upper left for &quot;rising&quot;, upper right for &quot;going&quot;, and lower right for &quot;entering&quot; tones).

John Chalmers in his &quot;English and Cantonese Pocket-Dictionary&quot; (1859) simplified the tone-markings by using: a syllable-final acute accent to mark &quot;rising&quot; tones, a syllable-final grave one to mark the &quot;going&quot; tones, no diacritic for the &quot;even&quot; tones, and italics (or in hand-written work underlining) to mark tones as belonging to the upper register. &quot;Entering&quot; tones could be distinguished by the consonants with which they end (p/t/k). Nicholas Belfeld Dennys used Chalmers&#x27; romanization in his primer. This method of marking tones was in most of its details used later also by the Yale romanization, where however, importantly, instead of the upper-register tones being marked by italics, the lower-register ones are marked by an &#x27;h&#x27; (which comes after whatever letter spells the last vocalic element in the syllable). Another innovation of Chalmers in this dictionary was to eliminate acute/grave accents on top of vowels by adding more distinctions of vowel-spelling (e.g. a/aa, o/oh), so that the presence vs. absence of an accent over the vowel was no longer needed to distinguish different pronunciations of it.

This new style of romanization still embodied the phonology of the &quot;Fenyun&quot;, and the name of Tipson is associated with its particular variety that then was fixed upon by his missionary peers to become Standard Romanization. This was the system used importantly: (with virtually no deviation) by Meyer-Wempe&#x27;s dictionary, (even more faithfully) by Cowles&#x27; dictionaries (of 1917 &amp; 1965), by O&#x27;Melia&#x27;s textbook, and by many other works in the first two thirds of the twentieth century. It reigned without serious challenge as the standard spelling until Yale&#x27;s system was devised and became an important rival to it.

The major linguist Y. R. Chao developed a Cantonese adaptation of his Gwoyeu Romatzyh system. It was first used in Chao&#x27;s &quot;Cantonese Primer&quot;, published in 1947 by Harvard University Press (which then in 1948, changed by him very little beyond swapping in of Pekingese for the Cantonese, became his &quot;Mandarin Primer&quot;, published by the same Press). The system was then modified by K. M. A. Barnett in 1950 into the Barnett-Chao romanization system. The B–C system was used in a handful of texts, including textbooks published by the Hong Kong government, such as &quot;Cantonese Conversation Grammar&quot;, published in 1963.

===Cantonese romanization in Hong Kong===
An influential work on Cantonese, &quot;A Chinese Syllabary Pronounced According to the Dialect of Canton,&quot; written by Wong Shik Ling, was published in 1941. He devised an IPA-based system of transcription, the S. L. Wong system, used by many Chinese dictionaries later published in Hong Kong. Although Wong also devised a romanization-scheme, likewise known as the S. L. Wong system, the latter is not as widely used as his transcription. This system succeeded the Barnett–Chao system as being the one used by the Hong Kong Government Language School.

The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (LSHK) has advocated the romanization it devised (and named Jyutping). An arguable advantage of it is that its particular use of J for instance (as at the beginning of its name) matches IPA in contrast to most other systems&#x27; using Y, resembling English. Some effort has been made to promote Jyutping, but it has yet to be examined how successfully this has caused use of it to proliferate in the region.

Another popular scheme is ILE romanisation, the only system of romanization accepted by the Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau and Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority. Books and studies for teachers and students in primary and secondary schools usually use this scheme, but some teachers and students use S.L. Wong&#x27;s system of transcription.

Those learning Cantonese may feel frustrated that, despite efforts to standardize Cantonese romanizations, most native Cantonese speakers, regardless of their level of education, are unfamiliar with any romanization beyond the conventional, Latin-letter spellings of Cantonese names. Because Cantonese is primarily a spoken language, meaning that its speakers do not in most genres of writing use its own writing-system (instead, in most of their writing, despite having some Chinese characters unique to Cantonese, primarily following modern standard Chinese, which is closely tied to Mandarin), therefore, it is not taught in schools. As a result, locals do not learn any of these systems. In contrast to the general use of romanization in Mandarin-speaking areas of China, systems of romanization for Cantonese are excluded from the educational systems of both Hong Kong and the province of Guangdong. In practice, Hong Kong follows a loose, unnamed romanization-scheme used by the Government of Hong Kong.

Google&#x27;s Cantonese input uses Yale, Jyutping, or Cantonese Pinyin (ILE romanisation), the Yale being the first standard.

===Comparison===
Differences between the three main standards are . Jyutping and ILE recognize certain sounds used in a few colloquial words (like 掉, 舔, and 夾) but have not been officially recognized in other systems like Yale. Letters &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are not used in any of the systems.

<text>The Trio Lescano was a female vocal group singing in Italian from 1936 to 1950, originally consisting of Hungarian-Dutch sisters Alessandra Lescano (Alexandrina Eveline Leschan; 1910–1987), Giuditta Lescano (Judith Leschan; 1913–1976) and Caterina &quot;Caterinetta&quot; Lescano (Catherine Matje Leschan; 1919–1965). Caterinetta left the group in 1946 and Italian singer Maria Bria (born 1925) took her place.

==History==

===Origins===
The three Leschan sisters were the daughters of Alexander Leschan, a Hungarian acrobat born in 1877 in Budapest, and Eva de Leeuwe, a Dutch Jewish operetta singer born in Amsterdam in 1892. In the Netherlands, where they were born and raised, they worked as circus acrobats. Though they were born in the Netherlands and Dutch native speakers, the three sisters were Hungarian citizens until they acquired the Italian citizenship.

Consequently to an accident, the father became disabled and the mother, a vaudevillian, decided to form an acrobatic dance group: however, only the elder sisters Alexandrina and Judith joined in under the management of Enrico Portino. They formed the &quot;Sunday Sisters&quot; and performed in Europe, Syria and Lebanon; Catherine was too young and stayed in a boarding school in Amsterdam.

In 1935 they got to Turin, where maestro Carlo Prato, the artistic director of the local EIAR, noted them and decided to raise them as a vocal trio devoted to harmonic singing. Their first reference group was the American Boswell Sisters.

The three sisters signed with Parlophon, a record label at the time distributed by Cetra. Their name was (&quot;Lescano Sisters vocal trio&quot;, shortened to Trio Lescano), their names and surname were Italianized due to Fascist language policies and their first song, &quot;Guarany Guaranà&quot;, was recorded on February 22, 1936, with the EIAR orchestra directed by Cinico Angelini, and it was published in March.

===Success===
The years between 1937 and 1941 were fundamental for them: they joined the Orchestra Cetra as singers, directed by Pippo Barzizza. This event gave them a sudden and extraordinary popularity and they were chosen to open the experimental broadcasting of the &quot;radiovision&quot;, the future Italian television. In 1940 they performed a musical number (&quot;Oh! Ma-ma!&quot;) in the film &quot;Ecco la radio!&quot; (&quot;Here Is the Radio!&quot;), directed by Giacomo Gentilomo and dedicated to EIAR. They recorded a great number of songs under the direction of Pippo Barzizza. 
On March 30, 1942, on Benito Mussolini&#x27;s proposal, King Victor Emmanuel III granted them Italian citizenship. The news – though at the time the population was concerned about the war – reached a large audience on daily newspapers, that proposed definitions for them as &quot;the three Graces of the microphone&quot;, &quot;the phenomenon of the century&quot;, &quot;the sisters who fulfill the mystery of the Holy Trinity&quot;, as Sorelle Marinetti reported in their show &quot;Non ce ne importa niente&quot;.

In 1943 they performed in the revue &quot;Sognamo insieme&quot; by Nelli and Mangini, with Wanda Osiris (then known as &quot;Vanda Osiri&quot;), Carlo Dapporto, Letizia Gissi, Nino Gallizio and Gianna Giuffré, with original musical compositions by Giuseppe Anepeta and choreographies by Vera Petri, directed by Mario Mangini himself. During their career, they often sang alongside famous singers of the period such as Ernesto Bonino (&quot;La famiglia canterina&quot; by Bixio Cherubini), Enzo Aita (&quot;Ma le gambe&quot; by Bracchi and D&#x27;Anzi), Maria Jottini (&quot;Maramao perché sei morto?&quot; by Consiglio e Panzeri), Oscar Carboni (&quot;Firenze sogna&quot; by Cesare Cesarini, &quot;Ti pi tin&quot; and &quot;Lungo il margine del fiume&quot;) and Silvana Fioresi (&quot;Pippo non lo sa&quot; by Kramer and &quot;Il pinguino innamorato&quot; by Casiroli, Consiglio and Rastelli).

They had however a very rich repertoire of their own, particularly swing songs such as &quot;Tulipan&quot; (cover of the song &quot;Tulip Time&quot; originally performed by the American Andrews Sisters, with music by María Grever and Italian lyrics by Riccardo Morbelli).
===Rumors of their arrest in 1942===
In a 1985 interview, Alexandrina Leschan claimed she had been arrested by Fascist police after a concert at the Teatro Grattacielo in Genoa. She reported that her sisters and she were taken to the Marassi jail under charges of espionage. She blamed upon the Codevilla sisters, members of the Trio Capinere who envied their popularity. Alexandrina also reported that her sisters and she were obliged to translate interrogations of the partisan prisoners because of their familiarity with the German language.

Twenty-five years later, a research published by Virgilio Zanolla contradicted what was reported by Alexandrina. Zanolla, after cross-checking Alexandrina&#x27;s 1985 statements with the Genoese chronicles of the time, maintained that the Lescano sisters were never arrested in the considered period, nor earlier or later. In fact, in November 1942, the trio gave several successful concerts during a two-week period. Zanolla himself assumed that Alexandrina came up with the story forty-years later in order to erase any rumor that they were compromised with Fascism. The assumption was confirmed by Mrs. Maria Rosaria Epicureo who claimed that the Lescano sisters overstated their summons at the police station.

===End of the trio===
After the war, in June 1946, Catherine left the group, officially to get married. In fact, her resignment was due to economic disputes with her sisters and mother. 21-year-old singer Maria Bria took her place. After a two-year Italian concert tour, she left for South America with Alexandrina and Judith on a traveling show. They remained together until 1950, when the trio broke up in Caracas, Venezuela, after Maria Bria had quit. Their fans never realized that Catherine had been replaced, and Maria never received any payment for her job. Once she was back to Italy, Bria was employed at the Turin Municipality and went on to retire in 1977. It was only then that the general public knew about the 1946 replacement, when Paolo Limiti invited her to the TV show &quot;Ci vediamo su RAI 1&quot; to tell her story. However, in a 2010 interview, Bria reported that the trio split up when Judith got married and left.

Alexandrina and Judith stayed in Venezuela and in 1955 Catherine, who was the younger sister, left Turin to join them back. She was the first of the three to die, of cancer at the age of 46 on October 3, 1965, in Caracas. Alexandrina, the eldest, went back to Italy and died in Fidenza in 1987. At the time, nothing was known about the third sister, who had presumably died in Venezuela in the Seventies, In the years 2010–2011, the Italian TV show &quot;Chi l&#x27;ha visto?&quot; even investigated on the possible time and place of her death. 
A 2013 resolution of the Turin Municipality, concerning the plaque-laying ceremony at the place where the trio had lived, reports 1976 and Venezuela as the year and place of Judith&#x27;s death.
