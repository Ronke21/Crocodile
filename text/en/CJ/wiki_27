<text>The 1978 South Lebanon conflict, also known as the First Israeli invasion of Lebanon and codenamed Operation Litani by Israel, began when Israel invaded southern Lebanon up to the Litani River in March 1978. It was in response to the Coastal Road massacre near Tel Aviv by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon. The conflict resulted in the deaths of 1,100–2,000 Lebanese and Palestinians, 20 Israelis, and the internal displacement of 100,000 to 250,000 people in Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces gained a military victory against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the latter was forced to withdraw from southern Lebanon, preventing it from launching attacks on Israel from across its land border with Lebanon. In response to the outbreak of hostilities, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 425 and Resolution 426 on 19 March 1978, which called on Israel to immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon and established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). 

Israel launched a second invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

== Background ==

Though it took the form of an invasion by the Israeli military of southern Lebanon, Operation Litani arose from the long-running Israeli–Palestinian conflict. After 1968, militant groups that formed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other Palestinian groups established a quasi-state in southern Lebanon, using it as a base for attacks against civilian targets in northern Israel as well as terror attacks on diaspora Israelis and other targets worldwide. This violence was exacerbated by an influx of some 3,000 PLO militants who had fled Jordan following the defeat of Palestinian groups to Jordanian forces during the Black September conflict; the Palestinian political cause began to regroup in southern Lebanon and re-shifted the focus of its attacks to Israeli targets, and did so via the Israel–Lebanon border. Israel responded to Palestinian attacks from Lebanon with extensive air raids against PLO bases of operations.

As a consequence of Israeli aerial attacks from 1968 to 1977, some of the Palestinian towns and camps in southern Lebanon were totally leveled. It is estimated that by October 1977, about 300,000 refugees—mainly Lebanese Shia Muslims—had fled southern Lebanon.

In November 1977, an exchange of gunfire led to the deaths of several people on both sides of the Israel–Lebanon border and led to Israel&#x27;s bombing of targets in southern Lebanon that killed 70 people, mainly Lebanese.

The proximate cause of the Israeli invasion was the Coastal Road massacre that took place near Tel Aviv on 11 March 1978. On that day, 11 Palestinian Fatah members led by the 18-year-old female fighter Dalal Mughrabi travelled from Lebanon to Israel, where they killed an American tourist at a beach before hijacking a bus on the Coastal Road near Haifa; the group later also hijacked a second bus that was bound for Tel Aviv. After a lengthy chase and shootout, 38 Israeli civilians, including 13 children, were killed and 76 were wounded.

== Course of fighting ==

On 14 March 1978, Israel launched Operation Litani, after the Coastal Road Massacre. Its stated goals were to push Palestinian militant groups, particularly the PLO, away from the border with Israel, and to bolster Israel&#x27;s ally at the time, the South Lebanon Army, because of the attacks against Lebanese Christians and Jews and because of the relentless shelling into northern Israel. The area south of the Litani River, excepting Tyre, was invaded and occupied in a week long offensive.

The operation began with air, artillery, and naval bombardment, after which IDF infantry and armor forces, comprising about 25,000 soldiers, entered south Lebanon. The Israelis first captured a belt of land approximately 10 kilometers deep, by launching a ground attack on all PLO positions along the Lebanese border with Israel. The ground forces were led by two division commanders, and attacked simultaneously along the entire front. Paratroopers landed from helicopters to capture all the bridges on the Litani River, cutting off the possibility of retreat by the PLO, and later expanded north to the Litani River. Shayetet 11 vessels were used as carrier platform for helicopters to attack targets on the northern Lebanese coast.

The IDF did not succeed in engaging large numbers of PLO forces, who retreated to the north. Many Lebanese civilians were killed by heavy Israeli shelling and air strikes, which also caused extensive property damage and internal displacement. According to Augustus Richard Norton, professor of international relations at Boston University, the IDF military operation killed approximately 1,100 people, most of them Palestinian and Lebanese. According to IDF reporting and internal investigation, at least 550 of the casualties were Palestinian militants initially holding the front line and killed by the IDF ground operation. According to other sources about 2000 Lebanese and Palestinian were killed.

Estimates for the number of people displaced by the military operations range from at least 100,000 to 250,000. Syrian troops deployed inside Lebanon, some of which were within visual range of the IDF, but did not take part in the fighting. The PLO retreated north of the Litani River, continuing to fire at the Israelis. The IDF used cluster bombs provided by the United States. According to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, this use of the cluster bombs violated the legal agreement between Israel and the U.S. because the weapons had been provided for defensive purposes against an attack on Israel. Israel also transferred American weapons to Saad Haddad&#x27;s Lebanese militia, a violation of American law. Carter&#x27;s administration prepared to notify Congress that American weapons were being used illegally, which would have resulted in military aid to Israel being cut off. The American consul in Jerusalem informed the Israeli government of their plans and, according to Carter, Prime Minister Begin said that the operation was over.

== UNSC Resolution 425 ==

In response to the invasion, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 425 and Resolution 426 calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon were both adopted on 19 March 1978. The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was created to enforce this mandate, specifically &quot;for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area&quot;. UNIFIL forces arrived in Lebanon on 23 March 1978, setting up headquarters in Naqoura.

Resolution 425 didn&#x27;t result in an immediate end to hostilities. The Israelis continued military operations for 2 more days until they ordered a ceasefire. The PLO&#x27;s initial reaction was that the resolution didn&#x27;t apply to them because it didn&#x27;t mention the PLO. The PLO leadership finally ordered a ceasefire on 28 March 1978, after a meeting between UNIFIL commander General Emmanuel Erskine and Yasser Arafat in Beirut. Helena Cobban has described the agreement as &quot;a turning-point in the history of the Palestinian resistance moment&quot; because it was the first open acceptance of a ceasefire agreement with Israel that was endorsed by all official PLO bodies.

Parts of the Palestinian resistance movement opposed the agreement and tried to violate the ceasefire. In April 1978, second-level Fatah leader Mohammad Daoud Oudeh (Abu Daoud) organized cells of about 70 to 80 fighters with the intention of breaking the ceasefire. Arafat and Khalil Wazir ordered the arrest of all involved and Abu Daoud was later accused of collaborating with Fatah renegade Abu Nidal to break the ceasefire. 
Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, turning over positions inside Lebanon to their ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia under the leadership of Maj. Saad Haddad. On 19 April 1978, the SLA shelled UNIFIL headquarters, wounding 8 UN soldiers (Fisk, 138). In April 1980, three Irish UN soldiers (Privates Barrett, Smallhorne and O&#x27;Mahoney) were kidnapped and two of them murdered by Christian gunmen. Private O&#x27;Mahoney survived (being shot by a sub-machine gun during the incident) in SLA territory; in a separate incident another Irish soldier, Private S. Griffin, was shot by Haddad&#x27;s men, and was evacuated to Israel where he subsequently died during medical treatment. The Israeli press at the time, particularly &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, accused the Irish of pro-PLO bias. (Fisk, 152–154).

Palestinian factions also attacked UNIFIL, kidnapping an Irish UNIFIL soldier in 1981 and continuing to occupy areas in southern Lebanon.

Hostilities continued as the Lebanese civil war escalated as fighting intensified in the south. Continued attacks in Israel from the Lebanese based PLO culminated in a second Israeli invasion in 1982 resulting in a flare-up that persisted over the next decade.

== Israeli withdrawal ==

In 2000, the UN Security Council concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425.

Lebanon has not extended control over south Lebanon, though it was called on to do so by Resolution 1391 of 2002 and urged by Resolution 1496. Israel has lodged multiple complaints regarding Lebanon&#x27;s conduct.

Hezbollah&#x27;s claim that Israel has not fully withdrawn (see Shebaa Farms) was explicitly rejected by the UN&#x27;s Secretary-General&#x27;s report which led to Resolution 1583. The Syrian occupation of Lebanon led to UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding the remaining 14,000 (of 50,000 originally) Syrian troop withdrawal and the dismantling of Hezbollah and Palestinian militias. On 26 April 2005, after 29 years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, the last of the Syrian troops withdrew in accordance with the resolution.

<text>USS &quot;Muskallunge&quot; (SS-262), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the muskallunge.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Muskallunge&quot;′s was keel was laid down on 7 April 1942 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 13 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Merritt D. Graham, widow of Chief Torpedoman Graham, who was lost aboard the submarine in late July 1942, and commissioned on 15 March 1943, Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Willard A. Saunders in command.

== First war patrol, September 1943 – January 1944 ==
Following shakedown, &quot;Muskallunge&quot; departed Naval Submarine Base New London, New London, Connecticut, for the Pacific, arriving at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 August 1943. Before her first patrol, she was assigned the task of testing the Mark 14 torpedo against the cliffs of Kahoolawe, including the torpedo returned by the USS Tinosa (SS-283). Two of the three torpedoes detonated. The third was recovered and inspected, allowing the discovery of a flaw in the contact firing mechanism that had plagued the Mark 14 torpedo for 18 months.

She cleared Pearl Harbor 7 September for her first war patrol, taking station off the Palau Islands. &quot;Muskallunge&quot; carried the first electric torpedoes to be fired in the war by an American submarine. She made two attacks on Japanese convoys; although handicapped by malfunctioning torpedoes, she managed to damage a passenger freighter and a cargo ship. On 25 October &quot;Muskallunge&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor.

She sailed 27 November for her second war patrol, which was conducted in the western Carolines area and south of Guam. During this patrol &quot;Muskallunge&quot; scored hits on a tanker and two freighters, sinking one of the &quot;Noroto Maru&quot; class, before returning to Pearl Harbor 21 January 1944. From there, she went to the West Coast for overhaul.

== Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, April – December 1944 ==
After overhaul at Mare Island early in the year, &quot;Muskallunge&quot; left Pearl Harbor 30 April on her third war patrol. In June she joined eight other submarines in an operation designed to intercept any enemy forces approaching the Marianas which the Navy was invading. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea two of these submarines landed fatal blows on Japanese carriers and American naval aircraft wiped out the Japanese Fleet&#x27;s air arm in a one-sided melee known as &quot;the Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot; &quot;Muskallunge&quot; ended the patrol at Fremantle, Australia, 4 July.

In company with , &quot;Muskallunge&quot; got underway 1 August for the South China Sea on her fourth war patrol. On 21 August off French Indochina she sank 7,163-ton passenger-cargo &quot;Durban Maru&quot; before being severely depth charged. The submarine docked in Fremantle 22 September for refit.

Her fifth war patrol, 19 October to 14 December, saw her operating west of Palawan Passage. She then left Pearl Harbor 16 December for overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, returning 9 April 1945.

== Sixth and seventh war patrols, April – August 1945 ==
On 26 April &quot;Muskallunge&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for patrol off Formosa. She also acted as lifeguard for Philippine-based airstrikes on China and Formosa on her sixth war patrol. She sailed to Midway Atoll via Saipan to complete the patrol on arrival 15 June.

Her seventh and last war patrol started 30 July when &quot;Muskallunge&quot; got underway for the Kurile Islands, north of Japan. On 8 August she attacked several small ships through dense fog. Her guns damaged two of the Japanese ships, but enemy fire killed one of the submarine&#x27;s gunners and wounded two other bluejackets. The news of victory brought orders to Tokyo Bay for the surrender ceremonies on board the battleship 2 September. The next day &quot;Muskallunge&quot; sailed for New London via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal. After operations with the Atlantic Fleet, she decommissioned and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there 29 January 1947.

&quot;Muskallunge&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

== &quot;Humaitá&quot; (S14), 1957–1968 ==
&quot;Muskallunge&quot; recommissioned 31 August 1956 prior to transfer to Brazil; decommissioned 18 January 1957, and the same day was loaned under the Military Assistance Program. She served the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Humaitá&quot; (S14) until returned to the United States in March 1968 and sunk as a target off Long Island, NY on 9 July 1968.

== Discovery ==
On 26 June 2021 NOAAS Okeanos Explorer explored the wreckage of &quot;Muskallunge&quot; with the ROV Deep Discoverer. The hull was found to have been severed near the forward engine room with the bow and stern falling to the sea floor separately.

<text>The Roxburgh Dam is the earliest of the large hydroelectric projects in the lower half of the South Island of New Zealand. It lies across the Clutha River / Mata-Au, some from Dunedin, some to the north of the town of Roxburgh. The settlement of Lake Roxburgh Village is close to the western edge of the dam.

== History ==

=== Development ===

In 1944 the State Hydro Department estimated that even with the power stations currently under construction they would only be able to meet projected South Island load up until 1950 or 1951 and that a new large power station was required. Detailed investigations by the Public Works Department identified two alternatives, Black Jack&#x27;s Point on the Waitaki River (where eventually Benmore Power Station would be built) and Roxburgh Gorge on the Clutha River.
A power station at Roxburgh had the advantage of being less remote, requiring less geological investigation, half the materials for the same power output and a better climate in which to undertake construction work, which were important considerations at a time of serious shortages of labour and cement.

Historical records showed that the long term flow of the river was and that a controlled flow of would be possible through the power station. The designers estimated that with an overall efficiency of 85% the mean output would be 160 MW and assuming an annual power factor of 50% the station could deliver a maximum output of 320 MW.

The Clutha River is fed from Lake Hāwea, Lake Wakatipu, and Lake Wānaka. There were already existing control gates on the Kawarau River at the outlet of Lake Wakatipu and it was decided to control the flows from the remaining lakes. After investigation found that the soil conditions were unsuitable at Lake Wanaka only Lake Hāwea received new control structure. This was commissioned in 1958 and consists of four radial gates housed in an earth dam. The dam raised the existing lake level and currently provides approximately 290 GWh of storage.

In December 1947 the Labour Government approved plans to build a hydro power station on the Clutha River. Initially only three 40 MW generating units were to be installed with the station having an ultimate planned capacity of 320 MW. The Clutha River between Alexandra and Roxburgh runs through a deep gorge which offered a number of locations for a power station. 
Investigations identified five alternative schemes at the Pleasant Valley site, and one scheme at the Tamblyn&#x27;s Orchard site. Initially Site No. 4 at Pleasant Valley, about upstream from Tamblyn&#x27;s Orchard was favoured. Subsequent detailed design studies however found that Tamblyn&#x27;s Orchard at Coal Creek where the river exited the Roxburgh Gorge near the town of Roxburgh offered the fullest possible head and thus the most power output, better tailwater conditions, the best access and would be closest to suitable locations for both construction and permanent villages.

In March 1949 the government committed to building at Tamblyn&#x27;s Orchard and plans were prepared to enable work on the diversion channel to start in June 1949. In October 1949 at the request of the Ministry of Works, Dr. John L. Savage - a former Chief Design Engineer of the United States Bureau of Reclamation - visited the site and provided advice on the proposed design options. While an earth dam was more suitable at the wider Pleasant Valley location after considering various options it was decided in October 1950 that due to the geology at Tamblyn&#x27;s Orchard a solid-concrete gravity dam would be more appropriate. Another consideration was that the Ministry of Works and Development (MOW) had limited experience with the construction of earthen dams and its only engineers with the necessary experience were engaged on the Cobb Power Station.

Many of the design decisions were based upon results from studies undertaken from 1949 to 1954 on a 1:80 scale model of the dam at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research&#x27;s Hydraulics Laboratory at Gracefield, Lower Hutt.

Initially the project was known as the &quot;Coal Creek scheme&quot; but after the Geographical Board had been consulted the name Roxburgh was chosen as name of the power station in 1947.

=== Construction ===

==== Work commences on site ====

The MOW was the government department responsible for designing and constructing the government power station in New Zealand. Though it was still unresolved who would be designing and building the dam and power station Fritz Langbein the engineer in chief of the MOW assumed that his organization would be undertaking the design and would at the least build the diversion channel. Therefore, he put in place plans to build a construction village and in July 1949 had the MOW commence work on the excavation of the diversion channel. This channel would eventually be long, wide and deep which required the removal of of material.

By the end of 1950 720 workers were being employed on site.

==== Construction village ====

To house the workforce the Ministry of Works first built in 1947 a single men&#x27;s camp and cookhouse on the west bank of the river. In 1950 work began on erecting 100 workers&#x27; cottages. The following year began on building a YMCA hall, shops, a hospital and nurses accommodation and a further 225 cottages. Eventually the village grew to 724 houses complete with a 90-bed hostel, a 600-child primary school, a cinema, a social hall, 17 shops, three churches, a fire brigade and ambulance building, four tennis courts, a swimming pool and a piped sewage scheme. In addition there were four single men&#x27;s camps (two on the east and two on the west bank) containing a total of 1000 huts. These facilities cost a total of NZ£2,241,925.

As the Otago Central Electric Power Board&#x27;s network could not provide sufficient power to the village and the project, the government built a temporary power station containing two 1 MW and one 0.4 MW diesel generators, to supplement the supply.

==== Transportation of materials and equipment ====

In May 1946 the PWD and the New Zealand Railways Department held a meeting to determine what would be needed to transport materials to the proposed site of the power station. The main loads associated with the first four generating units were as follows: thirteen generator transformers, each 39.5 tons (40.1 tonnes), 15 ft 6 in (4.72 m) long, 10 ft 4 in (3.15 m) high, 8 ft 2 in (2.49 m) wide; twenty-four stator sections; each about 19 tons (19.3 tonnes) gross, 14 ft 9 in (4.5 m) by 9 ft 1 in (2.77 m) by 6 ft (1.83 m); four shafts and thrust plates, each 33½ tons (34 tonnes) gross, 20 ft (6.1 m) long by 6 ft 6in (1.98 m) by 7 ft 10 in (2.39 m); four turbine runners, each 25 tons (25.4 tonnes), 12 ft 10 in (3.91 m) diameter, 6 ft 7 in ( 2 m) high; four generator bottom bearing brackets, each 20 tons (20.3 tonne) gross, 12 ft (3.66 m) by 12 ft by 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m).

The most direct rail route was via the Roxburgh Branch line to its terminus at Roxburgh. However this line had an uncompensated 1 in 41 grades and five chain (100.6 metre) curves that would limit the loads to 180 tons per engine. As well, four tunnels including those at Manuka and Round Hill on the line restricted the physical size of what could be transported, leading to consideration being given to enlarging them. This would have been expensive and restricted use of the line while it was being undertaken. As an alternative an investigation was undertaken into lengthening the Tapanui Branch line from its terminus at Edievale though a tunnel and some clay cuttings in the Dunrobin Hills to the Clutha River where it could connect with the Roxburgh branch line. Eventually it was decided to wherever possible use the Roxburgh branch line for all construction materials and smaller items of equipment. These were transported on the Main South Line to Milton where they transferred to the Roxburgh Branch which conveyed them to Roxburgh and from there transported by road to the power station. Consideration was given to extending the line to the construction site but this wasn&#x27;t proceeded with due to the difficulty of getting past the east end of the existing Roxburgh suspension bridge. To improve the line&#x27;s carrying capacity some curve easements were undertaken near Round Hill.

As the load carrying capacity of the existing roads was constrained by bridges at Henley (on State Highway 1) and Beaumont on State Highway 8) it was decided that as the Waikaka Branch railway line had no constricting tunnels it would be used to transport out of gauge heavy items such as the turbine runners and bottom bearing brackets. These items were transported on the Main South Line from the port at Bluff to the junction at McNab and then via the Waikaka branch line to its terminus at Waikaka. From there they were transported by road to the power station using a specialized transporter. This assist in the transfer from rail to road transport a 4-pole 30 ton (30.5 tonne) gantry was erected at the Waikaka railway station.
The road between Roxburgh and the construction site was upgraded and a second bridge built on the over the Teviot River on the eastern side of the Clutha River to supplement the existing bridge. At the construction site a long single-lane Bailey bridge with a carrying capacity of 24 tons (24.4 tonnes) was installed in 1949 to provide access across the river.

Timber used in the construction of the power station and the village was sourced from the Conical Hills Mill at Tapauni and taken via the Tapanui Branch to the Main South Line which provided a connection via the Roxburgh branch line to Roxburgh. At its peak up to 15,000 to 20,000 ft of timber was being transported by rail on a daily basis.

At the Roxburgh railway station the PWD erected silos to store the expected 50,000 tons of cement a year that would be consumed at the project&#x27;s peak as well as a six-pole 60 ton (61 tonne) lifting gantry It was expected that Shipments of bulk cement began in mid 1953 and by July of that year 600 to 1,100 tons were being shipped per week. By July 1955 demand had dropped to 800 tons per week with shipping of cement finishing in November 1956. By April 1956 Milburn had supplied 105,000 tons of cement with another 10,000 tons still to be delivered to complete the project.

NZR operated occasional sightseeing trains from Dunedin and Christchurch. The cost of a combined return rail and transfer bus ticket from Dunedin to the site of the power station was 16 shillings.

Where possible equipment was shipped on the Dunedin-Roxburgh Railway Line to Roxburgh and from there transported by road to the power station. For instance the transformers were railed from Port Chalmers to Roxburgh on the 40-ton well-wagons and then taken to the power station site on a Rogers 40-ton tank transporter. The stator sections and shafts followed a similar route.

Because of the line larger tunnels on the Waikaka Branch railway line the turbine runners and generator bottom bearing brackets were transported on this line. From the line&#x27;s terminus at Waikaka, they were transported by road to the power station using a specialized transporter.

==== Unsolicited offer ====

The Ministry of Works had identified that it had a shortage of the engineering and drafting staff to undertake the large amount of power station construction that the government had committed to in the North and South islands. Fritz Langbein believed that provided 1,000 workers could be obtained from overseas then the MOW would be able to complete the entire project in-house by 1954. In May 1949 the government reluctantly accepted that overseas contractors may have to be employed to meet the planned construction programme. This admission lead to an unsolicited bid being received from a British consortium consisting of civil engineering contractors Richard Costain, electrical manufacturers and contractor English Electric and Insulated Callender Cables to design and build the Roxburgh and other New Zealand power stations. The Ministry of Works had reservations about the lack of a guaranteed completion date, difficulties with divided responsibility if the consortium undertook both the design and construction, the potential for the cost to be higher than if competitive tenders were called and that it could give the consortium a monopoly over future projects of a similar nature. The State Hydro-Electric Department didn&#x27;t want to be restricted to one electrical equipment manufacturer and also saw the offer as a threat to their transmission line construction staff. Taking these concerns into account and wishing to avoid using up precious overseas funds the offer was formally rejected in September 1949 by the Minister of Finance in the Labour government.

Meanwhile, work continued on site on completing the construction village and creating the diversion channel. However progress was slow, with completion of the diversion not expected until 1953 instead of the planned 1951.

==== Call for tenders to contract the dam ====

In 1949 the newly elected national government, which ideologically favoured private enterprise, appointed Stan Goosman as both Minister of Works and Minister of the State Hydro-electric Department. By 1951 the projected project delays were serious enough to draw criticism from the Electrical Supply Authority. By now aware of the projected energy shortfalls and the shortage of government resources to complete six other hydroelectric projects that were underway as well as complete Roxburgh, Goosman&#x27;s response was to announce on 25 September 1951 that tenders would be called from interested parties to undertake the civil aspects of the project. This required the rapid production of tender documents and specifications by a short staffed government design staff. Bidders had the choice of offering on either a bill of quantities basis or by nominating a &#x27;target estimate&#x27; plus a 4% fee. In this type of contract the Government met all costs and the contractor received a fee of 4% of the total cost up to the target estimate. If the cost varied from the estimate, then 25% of the change was added to or subtracted from the fee. A &#x27;no loss clause&#x27; meant that if the cost overruns where high enough the contractor could lose their entire fee but would not suffer any further loss, other than those for not meeting agree completion dates. Eight tenders were received. Three were fixed price with a bill of quantities and the remainder were target estimates. The Ministry of Works had estimated that the work would cost £10,198,000 and the average for seven of the bidders was £10,068,838. The lowest bid was £7,4412,419 from Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts of England. The government engaged Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners of London to assess the ability of the bidders to undertake the work.

After negotiations with Hannen, Holland &amp; Cubitts of England who were joined by S A Conrad Zschokke a revised bid was received and on that basis a contract with a target estimate of £8,289,148 and a 4% fee of £331,566 was awarded on 25 July 1952. The contract had provision for a bonus of £350,000 for early completion. There was a penalty for late division of the river and a £1000 penalty for each day past July 1955 that the power station was not ready for service. The target completion date was 1 June 1955.

By late August 1952 the Ministry of Works had completed the two cableways that were to be used to carry concrete to the workface. To manufacture concrete on site the Ministry of Works purchased a Johnson concrete batching plant that had been used by the United States Navy in the reconstruction of Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack in 1941. This came into operation in early April 1953. Upon completion of Roxburgh the plant was transported first to Benmore power station and then later to Aviemore power station and the Pukaki dam to mix aggregate for the penstocks, spillways and other concrete structures.

The consortium bought from overseas 82 engineers, supervisors and administration staff and 322 workmen to the project and took over the civil aspects from the Ministry of Works on 29 Sept 1952. By this stage the Ministry of Works had completed the diversion channel and the consortium also took over these workers.

Prior to their involvement with the Roxburgh project Hannen, Holland &amp; Cubitts experience had been limited to commercial and residential buildings. Zschokke who had expertise in the construction of hydraulic structures were limited to only providing engineering services while Cubitts personnel filled all the management roles.

==== Concerns mount====
By March 1953 the Ministry of Works became concerned at the progress being made by the consortium and that their management team lacked the experience to construct a hydro power station, which was highlighted by the large amount of rework being undertaken. Progress was not helped by the Government directing the employment of a large number of assisted immigrants many of whom had little construction experience and limited English. In early 1953 at the government&#x27;s expense the consortium flew out 309 workers from Great Britain.

By October 1953 it was clear that the consortium would not meet the contracted July 1955 date for generation of the first power. In an attempt to improve progress the contractor replaced a number of senior project staff. Labour relations were also deteriorating due to uncertainty over the management changes, reduction in working hours to 40 per week and the impact of cost overruns on the workers pay. In November 200 British workers demanded either a 70-hour working week or their tickets back to Great Britain.

==== Downer&#x27;s takeover ====

With it having been necessary in 1953 to introduce power rationing in the South Island due to a shortage of generation the government decided the slow progress couldn&#x27;t continue and requested two directors of Downer &amp; Co, a major New Zealand construction company to attend in two days time a meeting at the Prime Minister&#x27;s summer cottage on 24 April 1954. At this meeting which was attended by representatives of the consortium, Arnold Downer and Arch McLean from Downers were requested by the government to enter the project as the managing partner with a 25% interest. After spending £4 million the existing contract was cancelled and a schedule of rates contract was agreed upon with the renamed Cubitts Zschokke Downer with a planned completion date of late 1956.

As a result of the forming of this new consortium Arnold Downer was put in charge of all site activities.

==== Diversion of the river ====

The preliminary works for the diversion of the river got off to a bad start when the explosive charge used in mid-June to remove the upstream dumpling damaged the steel sheet pile cofferdam downstream of it. This cofferdam has been constructed to ensure that water didn&#x27;t carrying any blast debris from the upper dumpling into the sluice channel. Eventually the debris and the cofferdam were removed, allowing unrestricted flow down the diversion channel.

Now it was necessary to block off the river so all of the water flowed down the diversion channel. The river&#x27;s average flow was and by June it had fallen to , but by the time work had been completed to a stage that a firm date of 1 July had been selected to attempt the diversion the flow had increased to . Extra bulldozers were allocated to the attempt as the steady increased to and then . If the diversion couldn&#x27;t be completed before the peak winter flows the project would have incurred a delay of between nine and twelve months. Despite studies that had indicated that the conditions were less than optimum Arnold Downer made the decision to go ahead. Using twelve bulldozers sufficient accumulated earth and rocks was moved at a rate of over twelve hours on 1 July 1954 to successfully divert the river into the diversion channel.

With the river diverted, cofferdams were constructed upstream and downstream of the dam and the water pumped out between them. The upstream cofferdam consumed of material, while the downstream cofferdam consumed of material.

There were expectations that gold would be found in the exposed river bed, but despite the MOW taking out a mining licence and employing two experienced gold miners, the results were disappointing. Once free of water work commenced on the excavation of the foundations for the main block of the dam. A large gravel filled hole was discovered in the centre channel or &quot;gullet&quot; of the river bed. This gullet which was deep and varied in width from 50 ft to was dug out and filled with a mix of pozzolana (fly ash) and cement under the dam while under the powerhouse Prepakt concrete was used as this reduced demand on the batching plant which was fully occupied supplying concrete for the dam blocks.

In July 1954 Downer replaced 20 senior contractor staff that he had inherited with people of this choosing, many from Morrison–Knudsen Co. A significant appointment was that of A. I. Smithies, a very experienced hydro construction engineer from Morrison-Knudsen as construction superintendent. With management in place the workfare was able to be reduced from the 1,107 when Downers took over, to 850. Under Downer&#x27;s management the pace of construction increased with the weekly concrete pour rapidly improving. In the first week of October 1954 of concrete was poured, which had increased to poured over the course of the next week.

By May 1955 the project was meeting its target dates with work on the powerhouse six months ahead of schedule.
The dam was constructed in wide concrete blocks with wide slots between them constructed in two profiles, those associated with the penstocks had an additional section containing intakes and screens as well as a downstream slope to support the penstock while the other profile had a flatter slope and were only wide enough at the top to house the road across the top of the dam. In conjunction with the block sizes, different concrete mixes and the passing of cold water through cooling coils were used to maintain the block temperature at 10˚C (50˚F) and thus cracking of the concrete. Cracking can allow water into the body of the dam which can lead to allow uplift and instability during earthquakes. Once the blocks had reached its final stable temperature the slots were filled with concrete.

Once the concrete in a block was stable the coils were filled with grout. A deep low pressure consolidation grout curtain was installed on the upstream side of the dame and extending into both abutments to improve the strength of the rock under the dam and prevent leaks. Drainage holes were constructed just downstream of the grout curtain as well as under the power house with 40 pressure gauges installed to record the up pressure on the structure.

A total of of concrete were used in the construction of the dam and spillway consuming . Cement was mostly sourced from the Milburn Lime and Cement Company&#x27;s factory at Burnside (near Dunedin) or via ship into Port Chalmers. A major expansion was undertaken by Milburn in order to supply the cement. Aggregate was obtained from the Clutha River at Commissioner&#x27;s Flat, while water came from the river.

Fletcher Holdings subsidiary, Stevenson &amp; Cook manufactured and installed the penstocks, the steel frame of the powerhouse and the spillway gate winches The rolled plates for the penstocks were transported by truck from their factory in Port Chalmers to site where a workforce of 80 men fabricated the plates using automatic submerged arc welders into sections in a purpose built workshop and then installed them in position. All welds were X-rayed during fabrication and radiographed after installation as well as pressure tested except for the concrete encased section at the intake. Stevenson &amp; Cook lost money on the penstock contract, which contributed to the company being wound up in 1959. Fletcher Construction undertook the work to clad and roof the power house.

==== Supply and installation of the electrical equipment ====

The State Hydro-electric Department undertook the design, purchase and installation and commissioning of the electrical equipment. Tenders for supply of the major electrical plant were issued in October 1949 with contracts awarded in May 1950 at a cost of £1,000,000 for the first four generating units.

The State Hydro Department established itself on site in June 1953. Access to undertake their activities was first provided in August 1954 and erection of the first generating unit began with the first scroll case concreted in by March 1955.

In November the joints in the stator windings of the generators were discovered to be faulty. Fortunately sufficient time became available to re-make all the joints when from 24 November 1955 for 23 work days up until the Christmas break the members of the New Zealand Workers Union were on strike in support of a union crane driver who had refused to lower a load being carried by his crane when the siren went for a tea break which the contractors estimated would delay the commencement of lake filling by two months.

==== Construction of the transmission lines ====

To connect the new power station to the major load centres, a long new 110 kV wood pole line was first built to Gore. The linemen then commenced constructing an long double-circuit 110 kV overhead transmission line using lattice steel towers to the Halfway Bush substation at Dunedin which was completed in July 1955 at a cost of approximately £500,000.

The principal connection, however, was a new 220 kV single-circuit overhead transmission line built using lattice steel towers from Roxburgh to a new substation at Islington on the outskirts of Christchurch. By 1949 the surveys for this line were well under way with by 1951 the construction camps established and the material on order. By 1954 the first section of the line had been completed, which allowed it to carry power from Tekapo A to Christchurch. A second section as far south as the Waitaki Valley helped improve supply conditions during winter. The Roxburgh-Islington line cost approximately £1,000,000 and was completed by the winter of 1956.

==== Lake filling ====

With power cuts being applied across the South Island by June 1956, the Minister of Works requested the contractors to concentrate all resources on work that would bring forward lake filling as far as possible. To encourage the workforce, the government offered a bonus of £2 per week plus £1 per day if the lake was filled before 19 August. At midnight on 21 July 1956, lake filling began and the lake level commenced rising at an average of an hour.

As the lake began to fill, increasing levels of water began to flow from the drainage channels behind the grout curtain in the right abutment, which indicated that the grout curtain was faulty. Investigations concluded that further grouting would have to be performed (which took about a fortnight) before the lake could be raised to its final level. The decision was made to allow the lake to fill to no further than the crest of the spillway while the contractors began drilling and inserting more grout. Meanwhile at 12:30 pm on 23 July a speedboat driven by Ken Harliwich and accompanied by Willis Wetherall to leave Roxburgh for Alexandria making the first boat trip on the new lake.

By 11:20 am on 23 July 1956, the lake had filled to the crest of the spillway water. With a desperate shortage of electricity affecting the South Island, commissioning of the generating unit 1 immediately commenced under the direction of electrical resident engineer Eric Gordon “Sandy” Sandelin. The urgency meant that present from head office in Wellington were the State Hydro-Electric Department chief engineer M. G. “Bill” Latta and its chief power plant engineer W. A. S. Surridge. Also present was the future station superintendent A. Rose. 
Once the engineers were satisfied that the machine was fit for service, it was connected at 6 pm to the national grid. Due to the reduced head, the machine&#x27;s output was limited to 30 MW. By the end of the next day generating unit 2 had completed commissioning and was also connected to the system. This allowed the 220 kV line to Islington to be brought into service as two machines were needed to provide sufficient reactive power to charge the long length of line. The third generating unit was commissioned on 18 August 1956 and the fourth unit on 11 December 1956. The power station was officially opened on 3 November 1956 by Stanley Goosman in the presence of 600 invited guests, plus members of the public.

Delivery of the four remaining generating units began late in 1959, with unit 5 being commissioned on 19 April 1961, unit 6 on 18 August 1961, unit 7 on 13 March 1962 and unit 8 on 1 June 1962.

The commissioning of Roxburgh removed the need for power restrictions in the South Island and ensure a surplus of power for many years.

==== Project cost ====

In December 1947 the government expected the project to cost a total of £11,500,000. By September 1949 when the final location and type of dam had been chosen the cost had increased to £17,000,000.

A contract of £8,620,074 was awarded to Hannen, Holland &amp; Cubitts in association with Conrad Zschokke. This was a target estimate contract with a &#x27;no loss clause&#x27;. In May 1954 the contract was re-negotiated to include Downer &amp; Co as the principal. The new contract was based upon &#x27;a schedule of rates&#x27; at a value of £10,120,000.

The final total cost of the project was £24,102, 800 of which £19,151,700 was for civil engineering, £445,000 on the bulkhead caissons and stage 2 civil works, £4,506,100 on the purchase and installation and commissioning of the eight generators and outdoor switchyard. Included in the civil engineering cost was £900,000 for the early completion bonus and £35,900 on expediting the programme.

A total of 3,500 drawings were produced between the Ministry of Works, the State Hydro-Electric Department and contractors to build the power station.

=== Service ===

In December 1965 a generator coil failed on unit 2, followed by a series of further failures between 1971 and 1973, which in an effort to correct, the windings were reversed. Units 1, 3 and 4 had their stators rewound in 1975 to 1976.

The sluice gate No. 3 in 1996 and gate No. 2 in 2001 were modified to enable the power station to pass an increased maximum design flood of . Gate No. 1 was also plugged with concrete. To improve the structure&#x27;s ability to withstand seismic events the original heavy chain and counterweight spillway gate operating system was replaced with a hydraulic system while the dam&#x27;s top bridge was strengthened and the gantry towers were lowered.

In the 1990s the power station&#x27;s control systems were automated with new control and protection systems which allowed it to be de-manned. Control of the power station is now undertaken from a control centre at Clyde Power Station.

==== Ownership changes ====

In 1987 the assets of the NZED (including Roxburgh) were transferred to the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ).

On 1 April 1996 ownership of Roxburgh was transferred from the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand to Contact Energy a State Owned Enterprise which subsequently passed into private ownership in 1999.
With the separation of Transpower a new control room was constructed on the former carpark to house the Transpower equipment needed to operate the transmission equipment. The original air blast circuit breakers were replaced with Sprecher &amp; Schuh SF6 circuit breakers in the late 1980s.

==== Generating units ====

The original generator design supplemented the fan pole-generated air flow with through-rotor air flow. During the factory acceptance tests one generator had been subjected to a heat run but in order to keep the windage and friction losses within the allowable 10 percent over the guaranteed value the manufacturer had blocked off the through-rotor flow which reduced air flow in the generator, with the coolers in the closed circuit, to 19.5 m3/s, which was about 90 percent of the design flow. This modification was applied to all of the generators. The limited time taken to commission the generating units had meant that no heat runs were performed, which would have identified the impact of this modification on the stator winding temperatures. As a result, the Roxburgh generators always operated at higher temperatures than most other hydro generators in New Zealand.

The traditional practice over summer to manage the generator temperatures was to open the generator air vents and use modified ducting to discharge the hot air outside the building, while also to open the main powerhouse door and start the extraction fans installed high in the wall at the other end of the machine hall.

In 1995, it was becoming apparent that it was becoming difficult to maintain the stator winding temperatures within their rated 65 to 75 °C operating range when operating at their maximum output over the summer months from January to April. As a result, it was necessary to de-rate the generators from 40 MW to 35 MW. This de-rating limited the station&#x27;s operational flexibility.

Investigations found that the over-heating of the stator windings was due to a breakdown of the stator winding insulation, thus reducing the heat transfer from the conductors, accumulation of dust and oil on stator winding and heat exchanger surfaces reducing their heat transfer as well as sustained high ambient air and river water temperatures over the summer, compartmentalization of the powerhouse to manage the fire risk, which reduced airflow through the powerhouse, all compounded by an inefficient generator ventilation system.

In 1997 the practice was begun of no longer opening the air vents over the summer as doing so effectively took one of the eight air coolers within the generator out of the circuit.

Modifications made to address the overheating issue included improving the airflow through the powerhouse, partial return to the original design of through-rotor cooling; changing the way water passes through the cooler and tube fin spacing; changing the core air duct configuration; and making the coolers slightly larger. As a result, the volume of air circulating within the unit has been increased by approximately 28 percent to 25 m3/s. Also steps were taken to improve the airflow though the powerhouse as described below.

Beginning in 2002 a major refurbishment was undertaken on all generating units, which among other works consisted of installing of new stator cores and windings, re-insulating the rotor poles, refurbishing the turbine runner and wicket gates, replacing the wearing ring on the turbine shaft, replacing the stator air coolers, as well as refurbishing where necessary any mechanical components.

==== Fire protection ====

When it was owned by the NZED the power station had been self-insured. Once it was transferred to the a state-owned enterprise ECNZ in the late 1980s it became necessary to obtain commercial insurance coverage. To obtain this insurance it became necessary to mitigate the risk of a station fire. As a result, from the mid-1990s onwards the ECNZ upgraded the fire protection at the station, which to reduce the spread of any smoke or fire included compartmentalization of the powerhouse into several separate fire zones. This compartmentalization lead in 1995 to either installing approved fire-stopping, replacing existing doors with fire-rated doors or installing double-sided firewalls with fire-rated doors. Once such barrier was installed between the stator floor and the cable gallery on the downstream side of the powerhouse. All doors were fitted with heavy-duty adjustable closers.
Unfortunately this compartmentalization restricted airflow and caused temperatures over the summer to reach the mid-30s °C on the machine hall floor and the mid-40s °C on the generator floor, peaking around 8 p.m.

To improve the air flow through the powerhouse temporary wedges were used to hold the fire doors open, but this compromised fire security. A permanent solution was implemented in 1999, when the wedges were replaced with electro-magnetic door retainers which combined with automatic door closers which hold the door open, but which in response to a fire alarm or a power failure automatically close the doors. Ventilation of the generator floor was further enhanced in 2002 by installing a ducted fan to import cool air from a dam drainage gallery.

==== Interconnecting transformer ====

In 2012 the original 50 MVA 220/110 kV interconnecting transformer T10 was replaced with a new 150 MVA unit which removed a significant restriction on operating of the Southland 110 kV network. This also removed the station&#x27;s previous restriction of the 110 kV generation to 90 MW and hence the total station output to 290 MW.

== Design ==

The power station consists of an , concrete gravity dam from which eight steel penstocks supply water to a powerhouse containing the turbines. The penstocks change from an intake section to 18 ft in diameter before tapering to 15 ft (1.4 m) where they enter the scroll case. Three 135 ton (137 tonne) spillway gates supplied by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. are located on the West (right) side of the dam. The designers anticipated a 500-year flood of . As a result, the spillway was designed with a capacity of .

At the base of the spillway were three 80 ton (81.3 tonne) low-level sluice gates supplied by Stahlbau of Reinhausen in Germany designed to pass . During construction these sluice gates were used to divert the river via a diversion channel. The upstream section of the diversion channel was unlined and followed an old natural channel of the river before reaching the spillway and sluice gate block which is curved at the exit to direct water away from the outdoor switchyard. The surfaces were finished to a high standard to ensure a smooth flow of the water during medium and high flows. One sluice gate was subsequently plugged with concrete leaving only sluice gates No. 2 and No. 3 in service.

=== Powerhouse ===

The superstructure of the powerhouse is constructed of welded steel framed clad in precast concrete panels. Two 118 ton (120 tonne) overhead cranes manufactured by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co run over the full length of the powerhouse, including the unloading bay.

The main generating equipment arranged on three floors: the main floor at , the generator floor at , and the turbine floor at with cable galleries on the downstream side that run the length of the building. 
The choice of the level of the main floor was governed by the dimensions of the turbine and generator. However, as this level is below the maximum possible flood level estimated at the time of the design to be at it was the powerhouse and the workshop were made watertight up to this level. As a result, the windows are set high and the doors are at the level.

Open to the machine hall but raised approximately three metres above the main floor at the western end of the powerhouse is the unloading bay underneath of which is the 400 V switchgear at main floor level and below them is the auxiliary generating sets on the generator floor.

The lowest level is the drainage gallery at which runs the whole length of the powerhouse and gives access to the draft tubes.

The generator transformers are located outdoors on a platform above the tailrace at .

=== Generating units ===

Each spillway drives a Francis turbine supplied by Dominion Engineering of Canada. The turbines have a nominal speed of 136.4 rpm with a guaranteed maximum runaway speed of 252 rpm. The turbines have a rated output of 56,000 hp at a net head of 148 ft (13.7 m), which consume of water at full load. The runners weigh 28 tons and have a diameter of 12 ft 10 inches (1.2 m). The speed of the each turbine is controlled by a Woodward supplied governor located on the generator floor. The generating unit are located apart between centres. Each turbine is directly connected to a dedicated to a 44 pole 11 kV synchronous generator supplied by British Thomson-Houston (BTH). Each generator has an output of 44.44 MVA at a power factor of 0.9 and a total weight of 362 tons with the rotor weighing185 tons. The generators are each enclosed in thick-walled octagonal concrete housing, each with a makeup air intake located in each upstream corner. The generators are air cooled by fans on the top and bottom of the rotor circulating air, while water cooled radiators located each corner of the generator pit removed heat from the air.

The output of the each generating unit is connected to three single phase generator transformers half of which were supplied by Ferranti and the remainder by Canadian General Electric. All had two equal secondary windings which allowed them to be configured to provide either 110 kV or 220 kV. Generating units 1 to 5 are connected to the 220 kV system and units 6 to 8 to the 110 kV system. The transformers are located on a platform above the draft tube. Each transformer weighs 59 tons when fill of oil. From the transformers overhead conductors carried the power across the tailrace to an outdoor switchyard.

The generating units were delivered with guaranteed efficiencies of 92.2% at three quarters load turbines, 97.36% at three quarters load and 97.67% at full load with a combined efficiency of 89.77% at three quarters load.

The 110 kV and 220 kV systems were connected by a 50 MVA 220/110 kV interconnecting transformer supplied by Brown Boveri. The outdoor 220 kV and 110 kV circuit breakers were also supplied by Brown Boveri and were of the air blast type.

=== Auxiliary power supply ===

To ensure a reliable auxiliary to the power station two auxiliary generating units were installed below the unloading bay and supplied from a shared 3 ft (0.27 m) diameter 243 ft (22.6 m) long penstock which ran from the top of the dam. Each unit has a horizontal Francis 765 hp turbine supplied by Drees &amp; Co of West Germany which drove via flywheel a 625 kVA 400 V generator supplied by General Electric. At full load each unit consumes of water.

The auxiliary generating units were upgraded at a cost of NZ$2.5 to $3 million in 2017.

=== Lake Roxburgh ===

Lake Roxburgh, the lake formed behind the dam, extends for nearly towards the town of Alexandra.

== Operation ==

Operation of the power station is covered by the requirements of six resource consents that expire in 2042. These require a minimum discharge of from the power station.

With the commissioning of Roxburgh, the sediment which had previously flowed down the Clutha river became trapped behind the dam. Regular surveys commenced in 1961 to monitor this sediment. By 1979 the average river bed level downstream of the Alexandra bridge has increased by 3.6 metres since the lake was created in 1956. The completion of the Clyde Power Station in 1992 reduced the sediment inflows from the Clutha River, leaving the Manuherikia River as the principal source. Floods in 1979, 1987, 1994 and 1995 have led many residents of Alexandra to put pressure on the owners of Roxburgh power station to better manage the sediment build-up. A major flood in 1999 caused flooding of large parts of the main business area of Alexandra. This led to Contact Energy and the government purchasing flood affected properties and flood easements over others as well as constructing a flood bank. Contact Energy has also introduced a program of drawing down the lake level during floods in an attempt to move flush sediment downstream.

Between 1956 and 1979 the maximum operating level of Lake Roxburgh had been 132.6 m before being reduced to 132 m. In December 2009 Contact Energy was given permission by the Otago Regional Council to return to a maximum operating level of 132.6 m. This would increase the amount of electricity that the power station could generate. When Contact Energy&#x27;s application was heard in October 2009 14 submissions were received on the application, eight in opposition, five in support and one neutral. The approval of an increased operating level came with the conditions to ensure that the power station&#x27;s discharge flow matched naturally occurring flood flows. When the flow reaches , the level of Lake Roxburgh has to be lowered to below 132 m, by either releasing less water at Clyde Power Station or increasing the flow through Roxburgh power station. Other conditions addressed mitigating the effects on amenity areas and walking track as well as the protocols to be followed if historic artefacts are found.

Since 2012 a trap and transfer programme and transported elvers (juvenile eels) around the power station. 2016 report

<doc id="1088861" wikidata="Q8025407" url="?curid=1088861" title="Winifred M. Letts">
<text>Winifred M. Letts (10 February 1882 – 7 June 1972) was a writer who spent most of her life in Ireland. She was known for her poetry, novels, and plays.

==Biography==
Winifred Mabel Letts was born on 10 February 1882 to Mary Isabel (née Ferrier) and Reverend Ernest Frederick Letts. It is widely accepted by biographers that she was born in Salford, Lancashire, England. She was educated first at St. Anne’s School, Abbots Bromley, Staffordshire and later Alexandra College in Dublin, Ireland.

She spent summer childhood holidays in Knockmaroon Park, Dublin, her maternal grandparents&#x27; home. After her father&#x27;s death, she and her mother moved to Ireland from England and lived on Glenart Avenue and, later, on Avoca Avenue, in a house called Dal Riada, in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock.

In 1915, during World War I, Letts joined the Volunteer Aid Detachment and was assigned to the Manchester Base Hospital in England. Trained to offer physical therapy to wounded soldiers, she served with the Almeric Paget Massage Corps in Manchester and Alnwick, Northumberland.

In 1926 she married widower William Henry Foster Verschoyle. William died in 1943 and Letts moved to England to live with her sisters in Faversham, Kent.

In the 1950s, she returned to Ireland and purchased Beech Cottage in Killiney, County Dublin. She moved to Tivoli Nursing Home, Dún Laoghaire, in the late 1960s. Letts died on 7 June 1972 and is buried in Rathcoole, County Dublin. A memorial plaque celebrating her life and work was unveiled in Rathcoole by President Michael D. Higgins on 20 June 2022.

==Writing career==
Letts was active in the artistic circles of Dublin. She was a member of the Irish Women Writers’ Club. She collaborated with several artists at the Cuala Press to create illustrated broadsides of her poems.

=== Poetry ===
Letts is remembered today as a poet of the First World War; however, her first publications were lyric poetry exploring Irish folk themes popularised by the Celtic Revival. An early poem, &#x27;The Sense of Faery&#x27;, was published in 1904 in the English literary magazine &quot;Occasional Papers,&quot; with further poetry appearing in the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Manchester City News&quot; (1906). Her first poetry collection, &quot;Songs from Leinster&quot;, was published in 1913. In 1916, by which time she was working as a nurse, she published &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en and Other Poems of the War&quot;. The collection was re-issued in 1917 as &quot;The Spires of Oxford, and Other Poems&quot;.

The publisher&#x27;s preface to &quot;The Spires of Oxford&quot; stated, ‘The verdict of the public, as shown by continual requests to republish, is that &quot;The Spires of Oxford&quot; is the most important poem in the volume—and therefore in issuing a new edition with several new poems, we bow to this verdict and give &quot;The Spires of Oxford&quot; its place in the forefront of the volume’. The poem &#x27;The Spires of Oxford&#x27; appeared in at least two anthologies published in America during the war, John William Cunliffe’s &quot;Poems of the Great War&quot; (1916) and George Herbert Clarke’s &quot;A Treasury of War Poetry&quot; (1917). Two lines from the poem are inscribed on the Soldiers Memorial Gate at Brown University, dedicated in 1921: &#x27;They gave their merry youth away / For country and for God&#x27;.

Until the 1980s, Letts’s war poetry was largely forgotten. In his 1922 &quot;Anthology of Irish Verse,&quot; Padraic Colum included &#x27;Synge’s Grave&#x27; rather than her war poems. As contemporary literary critics point out, poetry that privileged men’s experience of combat and that forged new directions in modernism was preferred over works that described the experiences of women during the war, particularly those on the Home Front. Stacy Gillis points to a new interest in women&#x27;s experience that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, when several critical studies of women’s war poetry were published, as well as the 1981 anthology &quot;Scars Upon My Heart&quot;, which included several poems by Letts.

Recent assessments of Letts’s war poetry have pointed to her use of irony in war poems such as &#x27;What Reward?&#x27;, &#x27;Screens&#x27;, and &#x27;The Deserter&#x27;. &#x27;Letts is at her best when she tackles the casualties largely left out of the official narrative&#x27;, Jim Haughey writes. Jane Dowson also focuses on the &#x27;anti-heroic&#x27; aspects of poems such as &#x27;The Deserter&#x27;.

However, David Clare notes the complicated legacy of Letts’s war poems within Irish history:  ‘World War I&#x27;s problematic status in Irish memory has meant that the Irish literary canon (as it is currently conceived) still has a hard time accommodating works that are simultaneously very Irish and yet also bound up with the British effort in the World War’.

=== Plays ===
Letts recalled her first experience with the Abbey Theatre in an essay titled &#x27;My First Abbey Play&#x27;. She saw John Millington Synge’s &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;, with Sara Allgood and William Fay. Augusta Gregory and W. B. Yeats were in the stalls. She remembered that &#x27;the spells of Synge’s speech and tragedy lay upon me. I was eager to write something in the same medium&#x27;. The play that emerged was the one-act play about a murder in Wicklow, &quot;The Eyes of the Blind&quot;. It was produced at the Abbey for one performance on 1 April 1907 and starred Frank Fay, W. G. Fay, Molly Allgood (Máire O’Neill), and Brigid O’Dempsey. A second one-act play, &quot;The Challenge&quot;, the story of a love triangle and a duel, premiered at the Abbey Theatre 14 September 1909. She rewrote &quot;The Challenge&quot; as a story, which was published in the &quot;Irish Review&quot; in 1912. Her only three-act play, &quot;Hamilton and Jones&quot;, was produced by the Gate Theatre, Dublin in 1941.

Between 1848 and 1952, Letts published a number of essays about the Abbey Theatre in English and Irish magazines.

=== Novels and short fiction ===
Letts’s early literary success came from novels for girls, such as &quot;Bridget of All Work&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Quest of the Blue Rose&quot; (1910). An early short story appeared in Cassell&#x27;s &quot;Magazine.&quot; Letts&#x27;s story &#x27;The Company of Saints and of Angels&#x27; was published by &quot;The Irish Review&quot; under the editorship of Thomas MacDonagh in January 1912.

=== Memoir ===
&quot;Knockmaroon&quot; (1933) is a series of essays and poems about Ireland that opens with Letts’s reminiscences about her summers with grandparents on the outskirts of Phoenix Park. She includes a number of character sketches of Irish people of all classes and often refers to the events of the decade after the Anglo-Irish Treaty as &#x27;the Troublesome Times&#x27;. The book is primarily pastoral in imagery, ranging descriptively over impressions of landscape and architecture. Letts also includes several chapters on gardening and garden books, confessing, &#x27;My secret ambition has always been to write a garden book&#x27;. &quot;Knockmaroon&quot; gathered together a series of essays that previously appeared in publications such as &quot;Cornhill&quot;, &quot;Spectator&quot;, &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;Irish Review&quot;, &quot;Irish Statesman&quot;, &quot;Month&quot;, and &quot;Country Life.&quot;

<text>Steven Jay Blum (; born April 29, 1960) is an American voice actor. Known for his distinctively deep voice, his roles include Spike Spiegel from the anime series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;; Amon from &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;; Heatblast, Ghostfreak, and Vilgax from &quot;Ben 10&quot;; Garazeb Orrelios from &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;; Starscream from &quot;&quot;; Sub-Zero from the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise; Tank Dempsey from the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; Zombies franchise; Ares in &quot;God of War&quot;, &quot;God of War: Ghost of Sparta&quot;, and &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot;; and Wolverine from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot;, &quot;Marvel Anime: X-Men&quot;, and various other projects featuring the character. 

He is sometimes credited as David Lucas, Richard Cardona, Roger Canfield, Tom Baron, and Daniel Andrews in various anime and other live-action appearances.

==Early life==
Steven Jay Blum was born on April 29, 1960, to a Jewish family in Santa Monica, California. As a child, Blum was overweight and bullied. To cope with these struggles, he would often draw, sculpt and create music. He would also often go outside and observe nature, marveling at sounds, shapes, and colors. When he was 12 years old, Blum worked at the comic section of his grandfather’s book store in Hollywood, California where he would sort and catalogue titles. He was a huge fan of cartoons and would often do impressions. Blum started doing impressions by request after leaving a voicemail with the voice of Goofy.

==Career==

Blum started his career working at the mail room of film studio Empire International Pictures. The head of the mailroom offered him a job on a “Japananimation” project since he had the deepest voice. Blum would eventually become head of marketing at a studio while doing voice acting on the side before deciding to become a voice actor full time. His credits include the voice of Spike Spiegel in &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Zeb Orrelios in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Mugen in &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, Roger Smith from &quot;The Big O&quot;, Orochimaru, and Zabuza Momochi in &quot;Naruto&quot; and Wolverine in multiple Marvel productions. In video games, he provided the voice of main protagonist Jack Cayman in &quot;MadWorld&quot;, Captain Foley and Tank Dempsey in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series, Professor Galvez in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, Ares in &quot;God of War&quot;, and &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot;, main protagonist Grayson Hunt in &quot;Bulletstorm&quot;, Brimstone in &quot;Valorant&quot;, Zoltun Kulle in &quot;Diablo III&quot;, Sub-Zero in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and &quot;11&quot;, Hal Jordan / Green Lantern in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, Rytlock Brimstone in &quot;Guild Wars 2&quot;, and main protagonist Capt. Devin Ross in &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho&quot;.

In September 2000, Blum voiced TOM, the robotic host of Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami programming block. He replaced Sonny Strait in the character&#x27;s subsequent appearances, until the cancellation of Toonami in 2008. When Toonami was revived on March 31, 2012, he returned as the voice of TOM. He is also the announcer for 7-Eleven&#x27;s &quot;Oh Thank Heaven&quot; television and radio advertisements and partnered with Vic Mignogna in the series &quot;Real Fans of Genius&quot; (a parody of Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s &quot;Real Men of Genius&quot; radio ad campaign). 

In animation, he is the voice of Heatblast, Ghostfreak and Vilgax in the &quot;Ben 10&quot; franchise; Garazeb Orrelios in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;; Count Vertigo in &quot;DC Showcase: Green Arrow&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot;; Wolverine, Red Skull, and Beta Ray Bill in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; and &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;; Starscream in &quot;&quot;; Heatwave in &quot;&quot;; and Amon in the first season of the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;.

On June 5, 2012, he was awarded a Guinness World Record for being the most prolific video game voice actor, having 261 credited appearances as of May 10, 2012.

==Personal life==
Blum married voice actress Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in 2017. He has three sons from a prior relationship. One of them, Brandon, is also an actor, while another, Jeremy, is a teacher. Blum enjoys collecting reptiles, fish and birds.

<doc id="1088868" wikidata="Q325406" url="?curid=1088868" title="Paul Mercurio">
<text>Paul Joseph Mercurio (born 31 March 1963) is an Australian actor, choreographer, dancer, TV presenter and politician. Mercurio is best known for his lead role in the 1992 film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and his role as a judge on TV series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

He has been an Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 2022, representing the electorate of Hastings.

==Early life==

Mercurio was born in Swan Hill, Victoria in March 1963, his father was American character actor and boxer Gus Mercurio. Paul began ballet at nine. When his parents separated in 1969, he moved to Perth, Western Australia with his mother, where he grew up in housing commissions and attended John Curtin Senior High School, now known as John Curtin College of the Arts where there is a theatre named after him. He credits his theatre arts teacher for inspiring him to follow his dream. Mercurio focused on acting during his high school years but after he graduated, he caught the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; train from Perth back to Melbourne where he studied at the Australian Ballet School.

By the age of 19 in 1982, he was Principal Dancer with the Sydney Dance Company—a position he held for ten years. During this time, he was commissioned to choreograph six works performed by the company.

==Stage and screen career==

===Feature films===
Mercurio made his film debut in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s breakout film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, receiving an Australian Film Institute Award nomination in 1993. Mercurio was a choreographer on the film. Flamenco dancer Antonio Vargas, the actor who played Fran&#x27;s father, also choreographed scenes in the film.

Mercurio&#x27;s other film credits include: &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;, &quot;Back of Beyond&quot;, &quot;Così&quot;, &quot;Red Ribbon Blues&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Woop Woop&quot;, &quot;The Dark Planet&quot;, &quot;The First 9½ Weeks&quot;, &quot;Kick&quot; and &quot;Sydney – A Story of a City&quot;. He starred, wrote, choreographed, produced and directed the short film &quot;Spilt Milk&quot;. Most recently, Mercurio has taken roles in independent films, such as &quot;Hunting for Shadows&quot; and &quot;A Silent Agreement&quot; with director Davo Hardy.

In 2019, Mercurio appeared in a supporting role as Sal in &quot;Promised&quot; (2019), a film directed and co-produced by Nick Conidi, and starring Tina Arena, Antoniette Iesue and Daniel Berini. The film was released in Australia on 24 October 2019.

Baz Luhrmann expressed some interest in using Mercurio in &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; to Mercurio&#x27;s agent, but after a series of failed attempts to speak to Luhrmann personally, Mercurio found out that there was no role for him in the movie via the production company. He has not appeared in any other Luhrmann films and only appears briefly in Disc 4 of &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy&quot; as a pixelated image.

Concerned about being typecast early on in his film career, Mercurio turned down the role of Adam Whitely (which instead went to Guy Pearce), in the 1994 film, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;.

===Television ===
Mercurio made his TV debut in a documentary on his life called &quot;Life&#x27;s Burning Desire&quot; in 1992. He starred in the lead role of Joseph in the Emmy Award-winning US TV mini-series &quot;The Bible: Joseph&quot; in 1995. Later, he joined the ensemble cast for the 1998 mini-series drama &quot;The Day of the Roses&quot;, depicting the 1977 Granville railway disaster, for which he received a Logie nomination. Throughout the 1990s, Mercurio guest starred in Australian TV shows including &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, &quot;All Saints&quot;, &quot;Murder Call&quot;, &quot;Medivac&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak High&quot; and &quot;Water Rats&quot;.

Mercurio was a judge on the Australian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; until August 2008, when he was dropped from the judging panel because he was deemed &quot;too nice&quot; for television. He was also a judge on the New Zealand version. From 2008 to 2010 he hosted a series called &quot;Mercurio&#x27;s Menu&quot; where he travelled Australia, cooking in different locations.

===Dance and choreography===
From 1982 until 1992 Mercurio toured with Sydney Dance Company both nationally and internationally, performing as a principal dancer and choreographing. After leaving the Sydney Dance Company, Mercurio founded the Australian Choreographic Ensemble in 1992, where he was the Director, Principal Dancer and Principal Choreographer until 1998.

Mercurio continues to dance and choreograph professionally. He has worked as a choreographer on five films, including &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and the Will Smith movie &quot;I, Robot&quot;. He has choreographed an American TV campaign for Coca-Cola, the Harry M. Miller production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; as well as numerous other stage productions. In January 2004, he appeared on stage in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.

He received a Mo Award for Dance Performer of the Year 1992, and was nominated in 2004 for a Helpmann Award for his choreography for the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;.

===Food===

Mercurio began brewing his own beer in 1988. He then hosted three cooking television series – &quot;Tasmania&#x27;s Food Trail&quot; (from 2006, for two seasons), &quot;Mercurio&#x27;s Menu&quot; (from 2008 to 2010. for three seasons) and &quot;New Zealand on a Plate&quot; (2011). Following this, he appeared on the cooking segments of numerous live daytime TV shows, including a featured chef spot on Channel Nine&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Show&quot; in 2013.

In 2009 Mercurio released a cook book called &quot;Mercurio&#x27;s Menu&quot;, based on his TV series, as well as “Cooking with Beer”, which were both best-sellers. In 2015, he released a third cook book “Kitchen Mojo”.

In 2005 Mercurio released his own beer in Victoria, and since then has held beer dinners and beer cooking demos and been a judge for international beer competitions. In 2016 he brewed Australia&#x27;s first Aphrodisiac Beer &quot;Ye Ole Horney Ale&quot;, together with BentSpoke Brewery. He then opened his own beer café in 2014, produced a range of meat rubs and condiments and formed his own company &quot;Beerlicious&quot;. He has since cooked in restaurants and at markets and festivals.

==Political career==
Mercurio was elected as a councillor for Mornington Peninsula Shire in November 2020.

In November 2022, Mercurio was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly, winning the ultra-marginal seat of Hastings for the Australian Labor Party.

==Personal life==
Mercurio has been married to his wife Andrea (who was a ballerina with The Australian Ballet and Sydney Dance Company) since 1987, and together they have three children: Emily, Elise and Erin. The oldest is a stage manager, the middle is a musical theatre actor and writer, and the youngest is a vet nurse and performs as a pop singer.

He appeared on the Australian version of the television show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2012 in which he discovered that his grandfather was a member of the Milwaukee division of Cosa Nostra (the Sicilian mafia) in the 1950s. Mercurio has reflected on this legacy in subsequent interviews and spoken about the effect it has had on his father, and his relationship with his father.

In 2000, Mercurio&#x27;s brother Michael took his own life in his early 30s.

In December 2022, Mercurio was hospitalised with complications from atrial fibrillation following his election win.

<text>An output device is any piece of computer hardware that converts information or data into a human-perceptible form or, historically, into a physical machine-readable form for use with other non-computerized equipment. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, or video. Examples include monitors, printers and sound cards.

In an industrial setting, output devices also include &quot;printers&quot; for paper tape and punched cards, especially where the tape or cards are subsequently used to control industrial equipment, such as an industrial loom with electrical robotics which is not fully computerized 

== Visual ==
A &quot;display device&quot; is the most common form of output device which presents output visually on computer screen. The output appears temporarily on the screen and can easily be altered or erased.

With all-in-one PCs, notebook computers, hand held PCs and other devices; the term display screen is used for the display device. The display devices are also used in home entertainment systems, mobile systems, cameras and video game systems.

Display devices form images by illuminating a desired configuration of . Raster display devices are organized in the form of a 2-dimensional matrix with rows and columns. This is done many times within a second, typically 60, 75, 120 or 144 Hz on consumer devices.

=== Interface ===

The interface between a computer&#x27;s CPU and the display is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This processor is used to form images on a framebuffer. When the image is to be sent to the display, the GPU sends its image through a video display controller to generate a video signal, which is then sent to a display interface such as HDMI, VGA, or DVI

GPUs can be divided into discrete and integrated units, the former being an external unit and the latter of which is included within a CPU die. Discrete graphics cards are almost always connected to the host through the PCI Express bus, while older graphics cards may have used AGP or PCI. Some mobile computers support an external graphics card through Thunderbolt (via PCIe).

=== Form factors ===

==== Monitor ====
A monitor is a standalone display commonly used with a desktop computer, or in conjunction to a laptop as an external display. The monitor is connected to the host through the use of a display cable, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, and more.

Older monitors use CRT technology, while modern monitors are typically flat panel displays using a plethora of technologies such as TFT-LCD, LED, OLED, and more.

==== Internal display ====

Almost all mobile devices incorporate an internal display. These internal displays are connected to the computer through an internal display interface such as LVDS or eDP. The chief advantage of these displays is their portability.

==== Terminal ====

Prior to the development of modern pixel-oriented displays, computer terminals were used, composed of a character-oriented display device known as a &quot;VDU&quot; and a computer keyboard.

These terminals were often monochromatic, and could only display text. Rudimentary graphics could be displayed through the use of ASCII art along with box-drawing characters. Teleprinters were the precursors to these devices.

==== Projector ====

A projector is a display that projects the computer image onto a surface through the use of a high power lamp. These displays are seen in use to show slideshow presentations or in movie screenings.

=== Technologies ===
Display technologies can be classified based on working principle, lighting (or lack thereof), pixel layout, and more.

; Cathode-ray tube (CRT) : CRT screens produce an image using electron tube, which fires electrons at a phosphorous coated screen to light up pixels in order to display images.

; Liquid crystal display (LCD) : An LCD is a display technology employing the use of liquid crystals to form images.

; Thin-film transistor (TFT) : A TFT refers to the thin layer of transistors used with an LCD.

; LED-backlit LCD : An LCD display which uses LEDs as a backlight. Prior to the use of LED based backlighting, Cold Cathode Fluorescent (CCFL) tubes were used. LED displays use an array of LEDs to form an image.

; Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) : Unlike an LED display, an OLED display does not use a backlight.

; Electronic paper (e-ink) : An e-ink display uses encapsulated pigment to form an image resembling printed paper, commonly used in e-book readers.

=== Color output ===

==== Monochromatic display ====
A monochrome display is a type of CRT common in the early days of computing, from the 1960s through the 1980s, before color monitors became popular.

They are still widely used in applications such as computerized cash register systems. Green screen was the common name for a monochrome monitor using a green &quot;P1&quot; phosphor screen.

==== Colored display ====
Color monitors, sometimes called RGB monitors, accept three separate signals (red, green, and blue), unlike a monochromatic display which accepts one. Color monitors implement the RGB color model by using three different phosphors that appear red, green, and blue when activated. By placing the phosphors directly next to each other, and activating them with different intensities, color monitors can create an unlimited number of colors. In practice, however, the real number of colors that any monitor can display is controlled by the video adapter.

== Auditory ==

A &quot;speaker&quot; is an output device that produces sound through an oscillating transducer called a driver. The equivalent input device is a microphone.

Speakers are plugged into a computer&#x27;s sound card via a myriad of interfaces, such as a phone connector for analog audio, or SPDIF for digital audio. While speakers can be connected through cables, wireless speakers are connected to the host device through radio technology such as Bluetooth.

Speakers are most often used in pairs, which allows the speaker system to produce positional audio. When more than one pair is used, it is referred to as surround sound.

Certain models of computers includes a built-in speaker, which may sacrifice audio quality in favor of size. For example, the built-in speaker of a smartphone allows the users to listen to media without attaching an external speaker.

=== Interface ===

The interface between an auditory output device and a computer is the sound card. Sound cards may be included on a computer&#x27;s motherboard, installed as an expansion card, or as a desktop unit.

The sound card may offer either an analog or digital output. In the latter case, output is often transmitted using SPDIF as either an electrical signal or an optical interface known as TOSLINK. Digital outputs are then decoded by an AV receiver.

In the case of wireless audio, the computer merely transmits a radio signal, and responsibility of decoding and output is shifted to the speaker.

=== Form factors ===

==== Computer speakers ====

While speakers can be used for any purpose, there are &quot;computer speakers&quot; which are built for computer use. These speakers are designed to sit on a desk, and as such, cannot be as large as conventional speakers.

Computer speakers may be powered via USB, and are most often connected through a 3.5mm phone connector.

==== PC speaker ====
The &quot;PC speaker&quot; is a simple loudspeaker built into IBM PC compatible computers. Unlike a speaker used with a sound card, the PC speaker is only meant to produce square waves to produce sounds such as beeping.

Modern computers utilize a piezoelectric buzzer or a small speaker as the PC speaker.

PC speakers are used during Power-on self-test to identify errors during the computer&#x27;s boot process, without needing a video output device to be present and functional.

==== Studio monitor ====

A &quot;Studio monitor&quot; is a speaker used in a studio environment. These speakers optimize for accuracy. A monitor produces a flat (linear) frequency response which does not emphasize or de-emphasize of particular frequencies.

==== Headphones ====
&quot;Headphones&quot;, &quot;earphones&quot;, and &quot;earpieces&quot; are a kind of speaker which is supported either on the user&#x27;s head, or the user&#x27;s ear.

Unlike a speaker, headphones are not meant to be audible to people nearby, which suits them for use in the public, office or other quiet environments.

Noise-cancelling headphones are built with ambient noise reduction capabilities which may employ active noise cancelling.

=== Technology ===

Loudspeakers are composed of several components within an enclosure, such as several drivers, active amplifiers, crossovers, and other electronics. Multiple drivers are used to reproduce the full frequency range of human hearing, with tweeters producing high pitches and woofers producing low pitches. Full-range speakers use only one driver to produce as much of a frequency response as possible.

While Hi-Fi speakers attempt to produce high quality sound, computer speakers may compromise on these aspects due to their limited size and to be inexpensive, and the latter often uses full-range speakers as a result.

== Tactile ==
=== Braille display ===

A &quot;refreshable braille display&quot; outputs braille characters through the use of pins raised out of holes on its surface. It is ordinarily used by visually-impaired individuals as an alternative to a screen reader.

=== Haptic technology ===
&quot;Haptic technology&quot; involves the use of vibration and other motion to induce a sense of touch. Haptic technology was introduced in the late 1990s for use in game controllers, to provide tactile feedback while a user is playing a video game. Haptic feedback has seen further uses in the automotive field, aircraft simulation systems, and brain-computer interfaces.

In mobile devices, Apple added haptic technology in various devices, marketed as 3D Touch and Force Touch. In this form, several devices could sense the amount of force exerted on its touchscreen, while MacBooks could sense two levels of force on its touchpad, which will produce a haptic sensation.

== Printing devices ==

===Printer===
A &quot;printer&quot; is a device that outputs data to be put on a physical item, usually a piece of paper. Printers operate by transferring ink onto this medium in the form of the image received from the host.

Early printers could only print text, but later developments allowed printing of graphics. Modern printers can receive data in multiple forms like vector graphics, as an image, a program written in a page description language, or a string of characters.

Multiple types of printers exist:
; Inkjet printers : An inkjet printer injects tiny droplets onto the printing medium via a series of nozzles on a printing head.
; Laser printers : A laser printer uses a laser to charge a drum of toner in order to mark points where the toner would stick onto the medium.
; Thermal printers : A printer which heats up a thermally sensitive roll of paper to reveal ink. Most often seen in retail stores to print receipts.
; Dot matrix printer : A printer which uses impact to transfer ink from a ribbon to the medium.

===Plotter===
A &quot;plotter&quot; is a type of printer used to print vector graphics. Instead of drawing pixels onto the printing medium, the plotter draws lines, which may be done with a writing implement such as a pencil or pen.

===Teleprinter===
A &quot;teleprinter&quot; or &quot;teletypewriter&quot; (TTY) is a type of printer that is meant for sending and receiving messages. Before displays were used to display data visually, early computers would only have a teleprinter for use to access the system console. As the operator would enter commands into its keyboard, the teleprinter would output the results onto a piece of paper. The teleprinter would ultimately be succeeded by a computer terminal, which had a display instead of a printer.

== Headless operation ==

A computer can still function without an output device, as is commonly done with servers, where the primary interaction is typically over a data network. A number of protocols exist over serial ports or LAN cables to determine operational status, and to gain control over low-level configuration from a remote location without having a local display device. If the server is configured with a video output, it is often possible to connect a temporary display device for maintenance or administration purposes while the server continues to operate normally; sometimes several servers are multiplexed to a single display device though a KVM switch or equivalent.

Some methods to use remote systems are:
; Remote access : The computer&#x27;s console can be accessed through a network connection such as the Internet, using protocols such as telnet or SSH.
; Remote desktop : Allows a graphical user interface to be accessed through remote access even without a monitor.
; KVM switch : Multiple computers are connected to a single display device which can be switched between computers.
; Serial port : A serial console can be connected to access the device&#x27;s console.

<text>Roxburgh (previously called Teviot and Teviot Junction) is a small New Zealand town of about 600 people in Central Otago. It is in Teviot Valley on the banks of the Clutha River, south of Alexandra in the South Island. State Highway 8, which links Central Otago with Dunedin city, passes through the town. Roxburgh is well known for its Summer fruit and &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Pies.&quot;

An important centre during the Otago gold rush of the 1860s, in more recent times Roxburgh has relied on a mixture of livestock and stone fruit production for its economic survival. It is one of the country&#x27;s most important apple growing regions and other stone fruit such as cherries and apricots are also harvested locally.

Five kilometres to the north of the town is the Roxburgh Dam, the earliest of the major hydroelectric dams built on the Clutha. There is also an opencast lignite mine located just north of town at Coal Creek.

==History==

The town was called Teviot, and from 1863 to 1866 Teviot Junction, but this name is instead now used for places such as the Teviot Valley and the Teviot River. The name Roxburgh was adopted on 18 April 1877. The name of the town comes from Roxburghshire in Scotland and was after the first European settlers arrived in the area. 

From 1928 until 1968, Roxburgh was served by the Roxburgh Branch, a branch line railway that ran to the town from the Main South Line. The railway never actually reached the town itself as the terminus was located about 2 km south of Roxburgh at the small settlement known as Hercules Flat. For the entire period the line served Roxburgh, it made a working loss, but it helped to promote economic development in the town and was an important means of supplying materials for the Roxburgh Dam. Today, relics of the town&#x27;s former status as a railway terminus still exist, including a turntable pit, a water tower for steam locomotives, and the station building has been converted into a hayshed and workshop. Most of the houses which once housed railway workers (also known as &quot;Railway Houses&quot;) still stand and are now in private ownership.

The Roxburgh War Memorial was unveiled on 24 May 1923. It is a square obelisk and lists the names of the 42 men from the town and local region who died in both World War One and Two. When unveiled it included mounted on a plinth, a German Rheinmetall 17 cm mittlerer Minenwerfer and a Maxim MG 08 Heavy Machine gun which was mounted on a tripod. The Mortar was captured by the 12th Company ( Nelson ) 2nd Canterbury Infantry Battalion on 2 August 1918, and returned to New Zealand as a war trophy. The Maxim Gun was stolen some time during the 1970s and the mortar was relocated on 16 March 2003 when a new Memorial Plaque was placed outside the Council Building &amp; Returned Services Association club-rooms.

Town scenes from the 2004 film &quot;In My Father&#x27;s Den&quot; were filmed in Roxburgh.

<doc id="1088880" wikidata="Q1182237" url="?curid=1088880" title="Dedovshchina">
<text>Dedovshchina (, ) is the informal practice of hazing and abuse of junior conscripts historically in the Soviet Armed Forces and today in the Russian Armed Forces, Internal troops, and to a much lesser extent FSB, Border Guards, as well as in other armed forces and special services of former Soviet Republics. It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts, NCOs, and officers. It is a form of non-statutory dominant-status relations between military personnel; the most common form of non-statutory relations, which is a violation of the statutory rules of relations between conscripts, based on the informal hierarchical division of soldiers and sergeants by enlistment and length of service.

The cultural basis of &quot;Dedovshchina&quot; is made up of traditions, customs and rituals that are passed down from conscript to conscript. Often (but not always), these traditions and rituals are associated with the humiliation of the honor and dignity of servicemen of the later conscription by servicemen of the earlier conscription. &quot;Dedovshchina&quot; encompasses a variety of subordinating and humiliating activities undertaken by the junior ranks, from doing the chores of the senior ranks, to violent and sometimes deadly physical and psychological abuse, not unlike an extremely vicious form of bullying or torture, including sexual torture and anal rape. There have been occasions where soldiers have been seriously injured or killed.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from &quot;ded&quot; (), which is the Russian Army slang equivalent of &quot;gramps&quot;, meaning soldiers after their third (or fourth, which is also known as ( or &quot;DMB&quot; )) half-year of compulsory service, stemming from a vulgarization of the word &quot;demobilization&quot; ( – this word is erroneously used by soldiers to describe the act of resigning from the army); soldiers also refer to half-year of conscription, with the suffix which denotes a type of order, rule, or regime (compare Yezhovshchina, Zhdanovshchina). Thus, it can literally be translated as &quot;rule of the grandfathers&quot;. This is essentially a folk system of seniority based on stage of service, mostly not backed by code or law, which only grants seniority to conscripts promoted to various sergeant and yefreitor ranks.

== Features as an offense ==
Non-statutory relations are a broader concept than . Non-statutory relations include the entire range of relationships between servicemen that are not described in the general military regulations (including the relationship between a superior and a subordinate, a subordinate and a superior). &quot;Dedovshchina&quot; in its narrowest sense covers only those violations of regulations that are related to the relationship between senior and junior enlisted personnel.

In addition, the modern science of criminal and administrative law distinguishes between crimes committed within the framework of the so-called and &quot;barracks hooliganism&quot;. The distinguishing feature here is the subjective side of the offense. In the first case, the intention of the offender is aimed at asserting his status as an old soldier, forcing a young soldier to perform household chores, performing certain rituals related to the &quot; traditions&quot;, etc. In the second case, the offender&#x27;s unlawful actions are motivated by personal hostile relations, national, ethnic, religious hostility, property relations, unexpectedly arising hostile relations, etc. 

Thus, violations of the statutory rules of relations between servicemen that do not involve relations of subordination within the framework of can be qualified as an encroachment by senior servicemen on the rights, honor, dignity, and personal integrity of junior servicemen.

Often, the phenomenon of is directly related to the ratio of physical and moral strength of the &quot;grandfathers, granpas, veterans, old men, &quot; (slang for &quot;masters&quot;) and &quot;devils, spirits, , chekists, , salabons, thingmen, young, elephants&quot; (slang for &quot;slaves&quot;).

One of the major negative effects of as a phenomenon is that this army subculture seriously undermines the authority of the army among young people of conscription age and is one of the main reasons for evading military service.

A similar phenomenon, however, not as pronounced as in the army, is also observed in some Russian schools, boarding schools, and other educational and social institutions. Victims are usually physically weaker, insecure, or simply younger. is not typical for the higher education system, and there are no recorded cases of phenomena resembling in civilian higher education institutions. This is due to the lack of an economic basis for in universities and other civilian higher education institutions.

== Responsibility ==
Violations of statutory relationships are categorized by degree of public danger into:

* disciplinary offenses
* criminal offenses

The latter category includes violations that objectively fall under the disposition of the current articles of the Criminal Code (battery, torture, actions that grossly offend human dignity, robbery, etc.). Responsibility is incurred under the general criminal procedure. Actions of a serviceman who allowed non-regular relations, which do not fall under the definition of a crime, should be regarded as a disciplinary offense (violation of the order of coming on duty for a shift, coercion to perform household chores (if it is not associated with physical violence), coercion to perform non-regular rituals (also without physical violence), etc.). In this case, the responsibility comes in accordance with the requirements of the Disciplinary Regulations of the Russian Armed Forces.

== &quot;Dedovshchina&quot; as a phenomenon ==
Dedovshchina involves the existence of unofficial hierarchical relationships that parallel the main formal ones, not excluding cases where officers are not only aware of dedovshchina but also use it to maintain &quot;order.&quot;

In official statements, some high-ranking military officials speak about the ills of society that have been transferred to the army. For example, such a statement was made in a TV interview by Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, former commander of the Northern Fleet, now a member of the Federation Council and member of the Defense and Security Committee.

Objective studies show that dedovshchina is a product of non-statutory economic activity in the armed forces. At the same time, dedovshchina is an auxiliary tool in the hands of the leadership, which can shift most of its responsibilities for maintaining order to the leaders of the informal hierarchy, offering them some benefits in return (early dismissals, lenient attitude to guilt, reduced physical activity, etc.)

Often, informal relationships are accompanied by humiliation and physical violence (assault). The direct victims of the phenomenon are team members who, for one reason or another, have a low status in the informal hierarchy (status can be determined by seniority, physical, psychophysiological characteristics, nationality, etc.) The basis of the status is physical strength and the ability to insist on one&#x27;s own way, as well as conflict resistance.

According to Amangeldy Kurmetuly, happens because the modern Russian military is primarily composed of men who did poorly in school and could not enter a university, and they repay the &quot;pressure and harassment&quot; they often received from authority figures onto those weaker than them. 

Manifestations of dedovshchina can be very different. In its milder forms, it does not involve threats to life and health or serious humiliation: recruits perform household chores for old men and, from time to time, their household tasks. In its extreme manifestation, dedovshchina reaches the point of group sadism. Manifestations of dedovshchina in the Russian army include forcing recruits to fully serve their &quot;grandfathers&quot; (for example, to wash their laundry), taking away money, clothes and food, subjecting them to systematic abuse and even torture, beating them severely, often causing serious bodily harm. Recently, extortion of money to credit a cell phone account has become very common. Recruits are forced to call home and ask their parents to top up their &quot;grandfather&#x27;s&quot; account or buy a recharge card, which will then go to the same account. Conscript service in the Russian Armed Forces is often not very different from the procedures and relations between prisoners in penitentiaries (&quot;zones&quot;). &quot;Grandfathers&quot; will often initially extort money from recruits by threatening to kill them. This is to test if the recruit has money, and the &quot;grandfathers&quot; will extort more money from the recruit if he obeys their initial demand. 

Dedovshchina is the main reason for regular desertions of conscripts from units and suicides among them. A significant part of violent crimes in the army is associated with dedovshchina: in some cases, these are crimes of &quot;grandfathers&quot; that have been brought to court. In others, the actions of recruits in retaliation, such as &quot;Artūras Sakalauskas case&quot;, when a Lithuanian private, after being nearly raped, murdered five fellow military servicemen, as well as the head of the guard, his assistant and the train conductor on February 23, 1987.

There have been cases where recruits who went on guard duty with military weapons shot their fellow soldiers who had humiliated them beforehand, including the case that formed the basis of the 1990 film &quot;The Guard&quot;.

==History==

Boys are always socialized not only vertically (adult males socialize boys) but also horizontally, through belonging to a peer group. In these groups, informal rules and customs are often formed, the observance of which is so important for young people that they are primarily guided by them, rather than by written laws and statutes.

The phenomenon of hazing has been described as far back as Eton College in the 16th through 18th centuries, where the authority of fellow students was even more cruel and capricious than that of teachers. The school community was of all ages. The age at which boys were sent to school ranged from 8–9 to 16–17 years old. The inequality in strength, age, and length of schooling created a rigid &quot;vertical of power&quot;.

Peter Alekseevich Kropotkin described the traditions that prevailed in the mid 19th century in the most privileged military educational institution of the Russian Empire, the Page Corps. The older students, the chamberlains, &quot;gathered the newcomers in one room at night and drove them around in their nightgowns like horses in a circus. Some cellmates stood in the circle, others outside it, and mercilessly whipped the boys with leather whips.&quot;

In the early 20th century, at the Mykolaiv Cavalry School, juniors were called &quot;beasts&quot;, seniors were called &quot;cornets&quot;, and second-year students were called &quot;majors&quot;.

&quot;Tsuk&quot; was an outright mockery of the elders over the younger ones: the younger ones were required to do things that were not supposed to be done by senior cadets: salute, make them do squats, howl at the Moon, give them offensive nicknames, wake them up repeatedly at night, and so on. Not only were the officers-educators of military educational institutions aware of the abuse, many of them were convinced that &quot;pull-ups give the junior class discipline and training, and the senior class practice in the use of power&quot;.

Participation in such customs was relatively voluntary: when a yesterday&#x27;s cadet, gymnasium student or student entered the school, the elders first asked him how he wished to live – &quot;according to the glorious tradition of the school or according to the legal statute?&quot; Those who expressed a desire to live &quot;according to the statute&quot; were relieved of the &quot;tsuk&quot;, but they were not considered &quot;theirs&quot;, called &quot;red&quot; and treated with disdain. Lower-level commanders, such as platoon commanders and watchmasters, were particularly picky about the &quot;reds&quot;, and most importantly, after graduation, no Guards regiment accepted them into its officer circle. Therefore, the vast majority of cadets preferred to live &quot;according to tradition&quot;, the shortcomings of which were attributed to camaraderie.

== In the Soviet Army ==
The first case of non-statutory relations in the Red Army was recorded in 1919. Three old soldiers of the 1st Regiment of the 30th Division beat to death their fellow soldier, Red Army soldier Kupriyanov, a native of the Balakovo district of the Saratov region born in 1901, because the young soldier refused to do their work for the &quot;grandfathers&quot;. According to the laws of wartime, those responsible for the soldier&#x27;s death were shot.

According to one version, the origin of dedovshchina problem is often attributed to the change in conscription term brought about by the law of 12 October 1967, causing two different groups of conscripts to be simultaneously present in the army: those who were drafted for three-year service and those only for two-year service. However, A.D. Glotochkin researched psychological problems of young soldiers before 1967. The timing of this coincided with the first wave of conscript shortages. It was found that the five-million-strong Soviet army could be as much as a third short of its strength, due to the demographic consequences of World War II.

During the same year, a decision was reached to draft conscripts with a criminal history into the ranks, due to a demographic crisis following World War II. While oppression by older conscripts has probably always taken place in the army, after that date, with the introduction of the four-class system (created by the bi-annual call-ups) it became systematic and developed its own rules and ranks.

The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Politburo, and a solution was found. People with a criminal record began to be drafted into the army, which had previously been completely excluded. Ideologically, this looked like a correction of fellow citizens who had strayed. However, in reality, things were different: the internal life of the army had changed for the worse. Along with the criminal element, the barracks were infiltrated by criminal networks, and thieves&#x27; jargon penetrated the soldiers&#x27; language. Copying prison customs, former criminals introduced ritual humiliation and abuse.

In addition, according to other reports, when the time of service was reduced from three to two years, for some time in the same military unit there were both those who were completing their third year and newly enrolled soldiers who were supposed to serve one year less. The latter circumstance angered those who had already served for two years but still had time to serve. Servicemen in their third year of service took out their anger on the new recruits.

However, there are reasons to doubt this version. According to the candidate of sociological sciences A. Solnyshkov, the first and most productive works of Soviet scientists dealing with the issues of dedovshchina appeared in 1964. In addition, according to him, over forty years of studying the phenomenon of dedovshchina, domestic scientists have not managed to make significant progress compared to the productive work of A. D. Glotchokin and his students in the early 1960s.

According to another version, in the late 1960s, some unit commanders began to widely use soldiers&#x27; labor for personal material gain. The non-statutory economic activities of military units led to the emergence of a system of non-statutory relations in which old soldiers acted as supervisors over first-year soldiers who performed work. Such relations required the young soldiers to obey any instructions of the old soldiers without question, and to break and turn the recruits into slaves, they were subjected to pressure and violence. Thus, according to this version, dedovshchina originated as a method of managing the non-statutory economic activities of military units. Over time, in a number of military units, officers began to use dedovshchina as a method of management, as they did not want to engage in training young people themselves, as well as educational work.

Also, by the end of the 1960s, the Soviet Armed Forces no longer had the number of veteran commanders who had been the majority in the Soviet Armed Forces after the end of the Second World War and who knew from personal experience that a healthy moral situation in the unit they were entrusted with was the key to their own lives.

In the summer of 1982, the Soviet Army received a secret order No. 0100 on combating non-statutory relationships.

The &quot;Sakalauskas case&quot;, a young soldier from Lithuania who shot a guard of seven old soldiers in February 1987 on the entrance to Leningrad, became widely publicized during perestroika times.

== In the Russian army ==
Alexander Goltz, a military observer for the , states: &quot;The country&#x27;s top military leadership has managed to defend the idea of preserving the Soviet-style mass mobilization army. This model, in principle, excludes any serious responsibility of commanders for the life and health of their subordinates, reduces conscripts to the position of slaves.&quot;

The bulk of the publicized cases of dedovshchina in the Russian Army are related to the use of young soldiers&#x27; labor for personal gain by the command staff of military units. Dedovshchina originated in the 1960s in the Soviet army as a method of managing the non-statutory economic activities of military units and continues to develop today.

In 1993, 169 Russian conscripts died as a result of . In a 1995 article, Benjamin S. Lambeth attributed the deaths to extreme incompetence and corruption within the Russian armed forces.

In August 2002, Senior Lieutenant R. Komarnitsky demanded that Privates Tsvetkov and Legonkov leave the unit&#x27;s location and go home to Samara and earn money through activities unrelated to army service. They were supposed to pay the officer four thousand rubles a month. The soldiers refused, but the demands were repeated and accompanied by pressure and beatings from the old officers.

In October 2003, Samara, Guards motorized rifle regiment of constant readiness. Soldiers who worked at Carton-Pack LLC explained that they did not receive combat training during their &quot;extra work&quot;. As a result, they never acquired the necessary combat skills during their entire service. Private E. Holtsiv said that he had fired his personal weapon only once.

On 10 October 2003, human rights activists from the organization &quot;Mother&#x27;s Right&quot; made a video recording near the military unit No. 12670 of the Volgograd Railway. They filmed dozens of soldiers being transported to work: 32 people to weeding, 10 people to &quot;Rotor&quot; (Volgograd football club). There were 3 or 4 foreign cars with entrepreneurs, minibuses that took the soldiers. There is information that about 200 soldiers were taken out of the unit on one day. Inspections began. The first deputy commander of the Federal Railway Service, General Gurov, came from Moscow. There was a prosecutor&#x27;s inspection. The commander and his deputy were brought to disciplinary responsibility. However, the illegal work continued until October 2004. The offenders became somewhat more cautious, and organized &quot;fake&quot; work – knocking down container boxes – on the territory of the unit.

Since February 2004, three soldiers have been working at a furniture company in the village of Nadiya (a suburb of Stavropol). None of them received any money or other support, which went into someone&#x27;s pocket. According to the investigation, the damage to the state from such &quot;write-offs&quot; alone amounted to 120,000 rubles.

The case that occurred on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006 in the supply battalion of the Chelyabinsk Tank School, where private Andrey Sychyov and seven other soldiers were beaten for about three hours by their fellow soldiers who were &quot;celebrating&quot; the holidays in this way, received a huge response. Sychyov, who went to military doctors, did not receive the necessary medical care in time. Only by the end of the holidays, due to a sharp deterioration in his health, the young man was transferred to a city hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with numerous fractures and gangrene of the lower limbs (which led to their subsequent amputation), bruises to his genitals (they were amputated too).

=== Impact of service conditions ===
It is generally believed that the most vicious forms of &#x27; are characteristic of &quot;second-rate&quot; units and branches of the military, especially the construction battalion (Стройбат), but &#x27; is often revealed in units and formations that are considered &quot;elite&quot;. &#x27; is much less widespread in troops or units whose soldiers have constant access to personal combat weapons (e.g., the Internal Troops).&quot; In addition, &#x27; is not widespread in aviation units. &#x27; is not widespread in small, remote units (for example, air defense radar reconnaissance units). The least manifestations of &#x27; are observed in units where unit commanders do not use the work of soldiers for personal gain.

=== Official response ===
Overall, the Russian state has tried and has had mixed results in curtailing &quot;&quot;. In 2003, on the specific issues of denial of food and poor nutrition, Deputy Minister of Defence V. Isakov denied the existence of such problems.

Vladimir Putin said that was a &quot;great problem&quot;, and proposed using the military police to prevent it.

Since 2005, the Russian Ministry of Defence has published monthly statistics of incidents and crimes including cases of death.

Russia has changed some of the rules made in 1967. Most notably, criminals are no longer accepted into the army.

Beginning in 2007/08, the conscript service time was reduced from two years to one; &quot;&quot; primarily occurs when second year conscripts abuse first year conscripts, so this measure is partially intended to curtail the practice.

==In post-Soviet states==
While most clearly prevalent in Russia, has been continued in the armed forces of some other post-Soviet countries.

=== Belarus ===
Hazing and beatings are problems in the Belarusian military, and government investigations have been criticized for characterizing deaths due to hazing as suicides without further investigation or punishment. The 2017 death of recruit Alexander Korzhych was particularly notorious for the brutal circumstances of his death (he was found hanging, with a T-shirt on his head and his legs tied with a shoestring), which caused President Alexander Lukashenko to publicly order a full investigation. While his death was still classified as a suicide, three soldiers were eventually found guilty of abuse of authority.

=== Ukraine ===
A 2000 report by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada concerning hazing in Ukraine&#x27;s army cited a 1998 statement from a Ukrainian officer that in 1997, 107 Ukrainian soldiers committed suicide as a result of hazing, and five more died directly due to hazing.

=== Azerbaijan ===
Hazing has continued to be an issue for the Azerbaijani military, becoming highly visible in 2008 when cell phone footage of recruits being beaten were leaked to YouTube. While official sources had beforehand denied that hazing was occurring in the Azerbaijani military, afterward abusive personnel were arrested and criminal cases were opened by military prosecutors. Independent researchers, including the military think-tank Doktrina Center, stated that hazing was on the rise. The Doktrina Center stated that from 2003 to 2012, 647 Azerbaijani soldiers died, 472 in noncombat situations. Activists contended that the Azerbaijani government concealed the extent of hazing and abuse in the military. In March 2013, large protests to demand greater openness and crackdowns on hazing were organized in Baku and were broken up by riot police; 80 demonstrators were arrested.

=== Armenia ===
Treatment of conscripts has been an issue in Armenia. 2010 saw public outcry due to a number of violent shooting incidents and the posting of a video which showed an officer beating two soldiers. Activists complained that the Ministry of Defense was reluctant to provide any information regarding the vast majority of the deaths caused by hazing. In early 2020, hazing became the subject of public concern in Armenia following a spike in non-combat military deaths. To combat hazing, the National Assembly of Armenia sponsored a law strengthening penalties for inciting soldiers to commit suicide. Naira Zohrabyan, the bill&#x27;s author, stated &quot;we have an incomprehensible structure, &#x27;dedovschina&#x27;, that mentality is moving from the street to the army.&quot; Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan issued a statement that decisions would be made to address &quot;problems associated with criminal subculture and discipline in the armed forces&quot;, which was generally understood as a reference to &#x27;dedovschina&#x27;, and fired two senior military officers.

==Current situation==
Many young men are killed or commit suicide every year because of &#x27;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that in 2006 at least 292 Russian soldiers were killed by &#x27; (although the Russian military only admits that 16 soldiers were directly murdered by acts of &quot;&quot; and claims that the rest committed suicide). The &quot;New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;On Aug. 4, it was announced by the chief military prosecutor that there had been 3,500 reports of abuse already this year (2006), compared with 2,798 in 2005&quot;. The BBC meanwhile reports that in 2007, 341 soldiers committed suicide, a 15% reduction on the previous year.

Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia works to protect the rights of young soldiers. 

In 2012, a draftee from Chelyabinsk region, Ruslan Aiderkhanov, was tortured to death by his seniors. The one witness who was willing to testify against the alleged perpetrators, Danil Chalkin, was later found shot dead in his military base. A contract soldier, Alikbek Musabekov, was later arrested in this incident.

In 2016, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; reported that bullying was divided on ethnic lines in a base in Kryazh (near Samara), with ethnic Tuvans and North Caucasians (together making a up about two-thirds of all soldiers at the base) bullying and delegating extra duties to ethnic Russians, who were beaten if they refused. This is exacerbated by the shortage of supplies for the troops, so the Tuvans and North Caucasians stole food from the Russian minority. The North Caucasian soldiers in particular were skilled in mixed martial arts, well-muscled, and attacked in groups, which allowed them to overpower their victims without the use of weapons.

In 2019, according to the Russian military prosecutor office the situation with &#x27; is getting worse. Incidents of hazing in the army during 2019 have increased. 51,000 human rights violations and 1,521 sexual assault cases. In the same year, Ramil Shamsutdinov shot 10 of his colleagues at a Gorny military base, 8 of them fatally. In court, he alleged that he was subjected to beatings and threats of anal rape. Valentina Melnikova, the head of the Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia, attributed the resurgence of &#x27; to the appointment of Sergei Shoigu as the Minister of Defense, since Shoigu did not take action against &#x27; when he was Minister of Emergency Situations. According to Melnikova, soldiers serving in the Ministry of Emergency Situations under Shoigu were &quot;enslaved by officers&quot; and &quot;beaten&quot;, and he did not take any action to stop it. She said that prior Ministers of Defense, starting with Igor Rodionov, but specifically Sergei Ivanov and Anatoly Serdyukov, took measures to reduce the amount of violent instances of &#x27; happening under their command. Shoigu denied that &quot;&quot; is currently taking place in the Russian armed forces.

In 2020, the Mother&#x27;s Right Foundation estimated that 44% of conscript deaths in Russia are caused by suicide, using data from &quot;requests for help it has received&quot;.

== Hierarchical stages ==
The meaning of the terms may vary depending on the traditions of the branch of service or military unit, as well as the length of service.

The main definitions in army slang for servicemen according to their length of service are:

* &quot;Smells&quot;, &quot;drishchy&quot;, &quot;disembodied spirits&quot;, &quot;quarantines&quot; – servicemen who are quarantined before being sworn in.
* &quot;Spirits&quot;, &quot;elephants&quot; (Navy), &quot;salagi&quot;, &quot;beavers&quot;, &quot;salabons&quot;, &quot;geese&quot; (Airborne Forces), &quot;vasky&quot;, &quot;batky&quot;, &quot;babies&quot;, &quot;hedgehogs&quot;, &quot;sparrows&quot; (Air Force), &quot;checks&quot; (Air Force), &quot;chekists&quot; (Air Force), &quot;shchygli&quot;, &quot;chyzhi&quot; (a backronym for &quot;man who grants wishes&quot;) – servicemen who have served up to six months.
* &quot;Elephants&quot; (Airborne Forces and Airborne Forces), &quot;pomose&quot;, &quot;laces&quot;, &quot;geese&quot;, &quot;crows&quot; (Air Force), &quot;crucian carp&quot; (Navy), &quot;young&quot;, &quot;walruses&quot;, &quot;goldfinches&quot;, &quot;mammoths&quot; – military personnel who served for six months.
* &quot;Skulls&quot;, &quot;scoops&quot;, &quot;yearlings&quot; (Navy), &quot;bold carp&quot; (Navy), &quot;pheasants&quot;, &quot;boilers&quot;, &quot;smears&quot; – servicemen who have served for one year.
* &quot;Grandfathers&quot; (dedy) and &quot;dembeli&quot; are servicemen who served for one and a half years. The name of the phenomenon comes from the persistent term &quot;grandfather&quot; (Russian: ded).
* &quot;Dembeli&quot;, &quot;citizens&quot; (considered almost civilians): conscripts who have been discharged after receiving an order to be retired.

In the Navy (at least until 1990), there were exactly 7 hierarchical steps:

* up to six months – &quot;spirit&quot; (a disembodied, asexual being, unable to understand anything, unable to do anything, unable to know anything, suitable only for dirty work, often helpless)
* six months – &quot;crucian carp&quot; (a fighter who has been trained in real service, knows the customs, traditions and his duties, but due to the slowness of the &quot;spirits&quot; is often beaten)
* 1 year – &quot;bold carp&quot; (This is a grated bun. He knows the service well. Responsible for the performance of work by &quot;crucians&quot; and &quot;spirits&quot;. Subject to physical action in exceptional cases);
* 1 year 6 months – &quot;one-and-a-half&quot; (The first degree of &quot;untouchables&quot;. Subject only to moral pressure from senior officers for neglecting their subordinates. A &quot;one-and-a-half&quot; is considered the most evil and merciless creature. At this level, people with low moral standards are very clearly manifested);
* 2 years – &quot;podgodok&quot;. The most liberal stage. People who are tired of the moral tension of &quot;one and a half years&quot;, not particularly &quot;bothering&quot; with official problems, just rest);
* 2 years 6 months – &quot;godok&quot;, or, alternatively, having been used in the TOF: &quot;sarakot&quot; (perhaps that is why the navy calls &quot;dedovshchina&quot; &quot;godkovshchina)&quot;. In reality, the ruling upper caste is the old-service men. They resort to physical violence in person in exceptional cases, mainly acting through &quot;half-hearted&quot; people. In turn, informal influence on the staff by officers is carried out exclusively through &quot;godoks&quot;);
* 3 years – &quot;profsoyuz&quot; (labor union), &quot;civilian&quot; (This &quot;rank&quot; was granted after the publication of the order of the Russian Minister of Defense on dismissal to the reserve. Immediately after the order of the Minister of Defense, a &quot;godok&quot; was informally recognized as discharged and removed from the reserve, but since he was forced to stay in the unit &quot;by the whims of fate&quot;, he allegedly lived on the funds of the navy labor union. Lives in a unit or on a ship as a civilian wearing a military uniform).

== Traditions of promotion to the next level of the hierarchy ==
&#x27;The transfer from a lower hierarchical level to a higher one is carried out in the process of the ritual of &quot;interruption&quot; or &quot;transfer&quot;. A soldier who did not earn the respect of his fellow soldiers or who violated the principles of dedovshchina, and who refused to live &quot;according to the dedovshchina&quot; within three &quot;golden days&quot; after arriving at the military unit (the so-called &quot;statutory&quot; or &quot;tightened&quot;), may remain &quot;unbroken&quot; – in this case, he is not entitled to the privileges of the higher levels of the unofficial hierarchy, but is equated with &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;smells&quot;. This happens infrequently, as an exception.&quot;

The transition to the next level is accompanied by physical pain in a special ritualistic way: a soldier who has served a year (previously, when the term of service was 2 years) is struck on the buttocks with a belt (metal buckle part), stool or metal ladle (scoop). The number of strokes is usually equal to the number of months served. The transfer from &quot;grandfathers&quot; to &quot;demobilized&quot; is symbolic, without physical action: the future demobilized man is &quot;beaten&quot; on the backside with a thread through a layer of mattresses and pillows, and a specially selected &quot;spirit&quot; &quot;screams in pain&quot; for him. In some units, additional strokes are given for the merits earned by the time of &quot;transfer&quot; (the rank of corporal or sergeant).

The navy also had a considerable number of customs and traditions, but it is worth highlighting only two main ones, which were often found in different navies.

* When translated from &quot;crucian carp&quot; to &quot;one-and-a-half&quot;, the so-called &quot;flushing of scales&quot; takes place. Depending on the weather conditions and the location of the action, the &quot;crucian carp&quot; &quot;wash off the scales&quot; by throwing them overboard, dipping them in an ice hole, pouring them out of a fire hose, etc., trying to perform the rite of passage unexpectedly for the &quot;initiate&quot;.
* &quot;tearing of godok&quot; – at the moment of the first printed version of the order of the Russian Minister of Defense &quot;On dismissal to the reserve&quot; (for example, in a newspaper), the entire military uniform, including socks and underwear, is torn into small pieces on the &quot;godok&quot;. The ritual is also performed unexpectedly for the &quot;godok&quot;. After the &quot;tearing&quot;, the &quot;godok&quot; becomes a &quot;profsoyuz&quot;, i.e. a civilian. Any serviceman up to the &quot;spirit&quot; has the right to take part in the &quot;tearing&quot;.

Usually, the &quot;transfer&quot; takes place on the first night after the Russian Minister of Defense&#x27;s order &quot;On Discharge to the Reserve&quot; is issued (usually on September 27 and March 27), but may be postponed for several days, as the command of any unit is well aware of the procedures of &quot;transfer&quot; and often in the first days and nights after the release of the &quot;Order...&quot; particularly strictly monitors compliance with the Military Regulations.&quot;

== &quot;Dedovshchina&quot; in popular culture ==
Several Soviet and Russian films portrayed the &quot;&quot; despite the military&#x27;s abstention from helping the production. The following is a selected filmography:
*&quot;Do It — One! – Делай – раз!&quot; – 1990 
*&quot;The Guard – Караул&quot; – 1990
*&quot;Afghan Breakdown – Афганский излом&quot; – 1990
*&quot;100 Days Before the Command – Сто дней до приказа&quot; – 1990
*&quot;Air Hunger – Кислородный голод&quot; – 1992
*&quot;The Green Elephant – Зеленый слоник&quot; – 1999
*&quot;Demobbed – ДМБ&quot; – 2000
*&quot;The 9th Company – 9-я рота&quot; – 2005
*&quot;The Search – 2014
Also, in the novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, Tom Clancy writes that veteran Soviet naval captain Marko Ramius refused to allow &quot;&quot; to be practiced anywhere on his boat, dismissing it as &quot;low-level terrorism&quot;.

<text>The All-China Journalists Association (ACJA), previously known as the &#x27;Chinese Young Journalist Association&#x27;, is a people&#x27;s organization established in Shanghai on November 8, 1937. November 8 now marks &#x27;National Journalists Day&#x27; in China. The society was established by Chinese wartime reporter Fan Changjiang and later organized and sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On September 15, 1949, the All China Journalist Association became the first Chinese media association to be formally recognized by, and integrated into, the International Federation of Journalists.

Membership in the association is required for all professional journalists in China as overseen by the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party. There are over 217 rural and industrial member organizations in the association, encompassing over 1 million individuals in the media industry in China. The All-China Journalists Association is also a member of the Belt and Road News Network, assisting in the network&#x27;s establishment in 2017.

== History ==

=== Founding members ===

==== Fan Changjiang ====
Fan Changjiang&#x27;s career in journalism gained domestic notoriety in China during the Sino-Japanese war, attributed to his work as a war correspondent in regional China. During this period, he made observations of poverty in rural China in his book ‘The Northwest Corner of China’ (Zhongguo de Xibei Jiao), espousing his melancholy to see &quot;bare-footed children…bound-footed women…plodding along’ on the “Refugee Trail&quot;.

Fan Changjiang promoted engagement with, and development of, the journalistic profession in rural communities to increase the visibility of minority groups and their diverse experiences during the war and under the existing government. Changjiang became disillusioned with the Nationalist government during the Sino-Japanese war attributed to their perceived disregard for rural communities, and later aligned himself with the CCP.

The Chinese journalist strongly advocated for transforming media practices in China, esteeming objective, factual reporting compared to commentarial pieces in inaccessible language created by his predecessors. Fan Changjiang launched the All-China Journalist Association to manifest this ideological shift, creating an organization where techniques, styles and good reporting practices could be monitored and imparted upon reporters from localities across China and amongst China&#x27;s various ethnic groups.

Fan Changjiang also participated in opening the ‘Reporters Hostel’ to create a physical location where reporters could collectively gather and share practices and develop ideas. In honor of Fan Changjiang&#x27;s contribution to the development of journalism and reporting in China, the All-China Journalist Association established the ‘Fan Changjiang Journalist Award’, the most prestigious journalist award in the nation.

Shao Huaze (born 1933), member of the dominant Han Chinese ethnic group, of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army since 1950, of the CCP since 1957, director of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; since 1989, was honorary president. Zhang Yannong (born 1948), president of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; since 2008, had been president of ACJA in the early 2020s. Liu Zhengrong, member of the Chinese Communist party, Deputy Chief of Internet Affairs at the Bureau of the State Council Information Office, and vice-president of Xinhua News Agency, had been Executive Secretary for the All-China Journalists Association.

=== Belt and Road ===

==== Project summary ====
The Belt and Road Project is a physical manifestation of China&#x27;s expansionary foreign policy under leadership of Xi Jinping. The initiative was launched in Kazakhstan at Nazarbayev University and in Indonesia in late 2013. The Belt and Road Initiative is of significance internationally attributed to China&#x27;s inextricable and transnational economic integration, predominantly through its role in manufacturing but expanding into other industries such as technology.

The Belt and Road Project has three predominant aspects: Overland, Technological, and Maritime. The Overland aspect includes coherent development of routes passing through Russia, Mongolia, the Middle East, Central Asia, Turkey and ending at Europe. The initiative&#x27;s Maritime manifestation includes control and ability to facilitate trade and movements through the South China Sea, Indian Ocean and towards the Middle East and Europe. Technologically, China has developed satellites, fiber-optic cables, communication networks, and has promoted the expansion of Chinese mobile companies to integrate the international community and China more deeply. The Chinese government has launched initiatives to these effects, such as developing railways in the south-east Asian region. China has also worked to influence nations through crafting aid agreements, bilateral trading agreements and establishing free trade with participating and cooperative nations.

==== All-China Journalists Association and Belt and Road ====
The All-China Journalists Association regularly cooperates with the Chinese government and member organizations and journalists to produce content that updates about and promotes the Belt and Road Project. This is exemplified through articles published by the organization in cooperation with oligarchical Chinese news agencies such as Xinhuanet and &quot;China Daily&quot;. A report on May 5, 2020, from the organization in collaboration with China Daily alludes to Russian collaboration through the assertion &quot;we are all in a community of common destiny.”

In 2018, the All-China Journalists Association assembled the BRI Journalists Forum, which included approximately 100 representatives from 47 developing countries.

==== The Belt and Road Journalists Network ====
The Belt and Road Initiative has also enabled the All-China Journalist Society, in collaboration with other members of the Belt and Road Project to create a ‘Belt and Road Journalists Network. The Belt and Road News Network, launched in 2017, encompasses 208 media organizations from over 98 different nations. The Chair of the organization is China&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in collaboration with the All-China Journalists Association with the Secretariat located at ‘People&#x27;s Daily’ in Beijing, China. The first council meeting was held in 2019, in Beijing, China, with over 40 international media organizations present.

This collaboration encompasses multiple media forms, including music, photography and news. Belt and Road News Network activities include collaborative media trips, shared access to news and media archives and databases, collective workshops and training seminars, as well as awards. In September 2019, the Belt and Road News Network held a media workshop in China; over 47 countries were represented and over 100 senior correspondents and senior editors were present.

<text>Taramasalata or taramosalata (; from &#x27;fish roe&#x27; &lt; + Greek: &#x27;salad&#x27; &lt; ) is a meze made from &quot;tarama&quot;, the salted and cured roe (colloquially referred to as caviar) of the cod, carp, or grey mullet (bottarga) mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a starchy base of bread or potatoes, or sometimes almonds. Variants may include garlic, spring onions, or peppers, or vinegar instead of lemon juice. While not traditionally Greek, smoked rather than cured cod&#x27;s roe is more widely available in some places, and often used. Bottarga is usually much more expensive than cod&#x27;s roe.

Traditionally the dish is made with a pestle and mortar, giving a slightly grainy texture, but commercial taramasalata is commonly blended to a very smooth paste.

Taramasalata is usually served as a &quot;meze&quot;, often with ouzo, as a spread on bread. The colour can vary from creamy beige to pink, depending on the type of roe and colourings used. Most taramasalata sold commercially is dyed pink, but high-quality taramasalata is always beige in colour.

In Greece, taramasalata is often served on Clean Monday (, ), the first day of Great Lent, with onions and lemon.

==Etymology==
Borrowed from Greek word &quot;ταραμάς&quot; (roe), itself a borrowing from Turkish &quot;tarama&quot;. Normally, &quot;tarama&quot; is the salted roe itself, but sometimes the prepared dish is also called &quot;tarama&quot;.

The spelling taramosalata reflects the Greek, but in English the &quot;a&quot; spelling is common.


A similar dip or spread, (&#x27;roe salad&#x27; in Romanian) is also common in Romania and Bulgaria (known as , or ), and Israel (where it is known as &quot;ikra)&quot;. It is made with pike or carp roe, but generally with sunflower or vegetable oil instead of olive oil, sometimes with a thickener like white bread. It is mass-produced and is widely available in grocery shops and supermarkets, as well as being made at home, in which case chopped onions are commonly added. It has a consistency and taste similar to mayonnaise, with the roe taking the place of the egg as protein. The traditional production method of &quot;salată de icre&quot; is standardized under the Romanian departmental standard N.I.D. 927-70 N 23 and registered as an EU Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under the name &quot;Salată tradițională cu icre de carp&quot;. The roe of this product is for over 50% carp based. 

A dip, or (mashed beans), prepared with mashed beans, sunflower oil, garlic and chopped onions, is sometimes called (beans roe).

<text>Moira O&#x27;Neill was the pseudonym of Agnes Shakespear Higginson (1864–1955), an Irish-Canadian poet who wrote ballads and other verse inspired by County Antrim, where she lived at Cushendun. In 1895, she and her husband Walter Skrine lived on a 16,500 acre ranch in Alberta. But they returned to Ireland and were, in 1921, burned out of their mansion Ballyrankin House near Bunclody.

She also used the name Nesta. She published &quot;Songs of the Glens of Antrim&quot; (1900) and &quot;More Songs of the Glens of Antrim&quot; (1921). From the first of these collections, composer Charles Villiers Stanford selected the six poems of his song-cycle &#x27;An Irish Idyll&#x27; (publ. 1901), dedicated to baritone Harry Plunket Greene, which includes one of Stanford&#x27;s best-known songs, &#x27;The Fairy Lough&#x27;. Her poem &quot;Sea Wrack&quot; was also set to music for voice and piano by the composer Hamilton Harty and this remains a popular work today.

== Early life and family ==

Moira O&#x27;Neill was born in Mauritius on the 13th of July, 1864 and was raised in Cushendun, County Antrim in Ireland. She used the name &quot;Moira O&#x27;Neill&quot; to publish her poems, However her birth name was &quot;Agnes Higginson&quot; but people used to call her &quot;Nesta&quot;. She was the youngest daughter of Charles Higginson who was a colonial administrator in Mauritius and Mary Higginson who was the daughter of the Governor of Mauritius Sir James MacAuley. Charles and Mary were initially first cousins and raised seven children together, four boys and three girls. Agnes&#x27;s brothers joined the military which then encouraged the family to move to Rockport, Cushendun in County Antrim.

On the 5th of June, 1895, Agnes married Walter Clarmont Skrine who was born in Warleigh Manor, County Somerset. The couple was married in Cushendun and after that moved to Alberta, Canada since Walter had land holdings placed there.&quot;The couple settled in the Bar S Ranch, 24 miles southwest of High River where Walter had nearly 17,000 acres under lease and built a new, two-story home for his family, the lumber freighted from Calgary by teams of horses&quot;. Agnes and Walter raised five children together, three sons and two daughters. Charles John and Susan were born in Canada, Mary Nesta who became a famous writer and was known as &quot;Molly Keane&quot;, Godfrey Higginson and Walter Henry were born in Ireland when the family moved back in 1902 and settled in the Ballyrankin House, Ferns, County Wexford. However, in 1921 the house was burned down by the republicans and the Skrine family had to move back to Northern Ireland and lived at their cousins house until the Skrine&#x27;s home in Ballyrankin was stable to live in again.

== Later life and death ==
After marrying Walter Clarmont Skrine in 1895 the couple re located to live a rather secluded life on Walters 17,000-acre ranch 24 miles southwest of high river in Alberta Canada. They would live peacefully there for six years, starting a family, before returning to Moira’s beloved Ireland in 1902. With the family now growing larger, the family originally settled on the outskirts of Dublin in Ballymore Eustace County Kildare before moving ultimately to Ferns in County Wexford. Having had her family home in Ferns tragically burned down by republicans during the war of independence, Moira along with Husband Walter re located temporarily to the north of Ireland while they awaited the reconstruction of their home. It was during this stay in the north of Ireland that reminded her of the deep-rooted love for Antrim she still possessed, the county in which she was born, and inspired her to publish &#x27;More songs of the Glens of Antrim&#x27; a somewhat sequel to her earlier release in 1901 &#x27;Songs of the glens of Antrim&#x27; one of Moira O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s most coveted collections of poetry. Although Agnes took her husband&#x27;s last name, she continued to write under her nom de plume &#x27;Moira O&#x27;Neill&#x27; well into her later life as she continued to publish Poetry.

O&#x27;Neill and husband Walter had five children. Their daughter Mary went on to become a novelist and playwright who went under the pen names &#x27;Molly Keane&#x27; and occasionally &#x27;M.J Farrell&#x27;. It was in 1930 that O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s husband Walter would pass away leaving his wife, then 65, to live another quarter of a century without him. With her children grown up and having never been a social character, O&#x27;Neill became even more introverted and isolated socially without her family present. Moira O&#x27;Neill died at Ballyrankin house in County Wexford on January 22, 1955, aged 90.

<doc id="1088898" wikidata="Q431554" url="?curid=1088898" title="Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)">
<text>Lucila Justina Sarsines Reyes (July 19, 1936 – October 31, 1973), was a Peruvian performer and one of the most respected singers of her country, one of Peru&#x27;s most famous African-Peruvian personalities as well as a symbol of Peruvian nationalism both in Peru and to expatriates. She was also known by the pseudonyms &quot;La Morena de Oro del Perú&quot;, given to her by Augusto Ferrando, and &quot;La Reina de la Popularidad&quot;. She is well known for her voice and her music has gone through history as some of the best in the history of Peruvian music.

==History==

Born to a poor family in the capital, Lima, Reyes was one of sixteen siblings. Her father, Tobías Sarsines, died after she turned six months old. Reyes spent much of her childhood living away from her immediate family. She sold newspapers and lottery tickets to survive. Her house burned down, and she went on to live at a Catholic church.

As a child, Reyes met Pitito Pérez, a famous Peruvian singer of the era. Pérez liked her voice and invited her to join him in a duo. The duo was named &quot;Lucha y Juan&quot;. The duo gave Reyes the opportunity to be heard on national radio stations. Lucha Reyes debuted in a show named &quot;El Sentir de los Barrios&quot; (or &quot;The way the Neighborhoods Feel&quot;) singing the cultural standard &quot;Abandonada&quot; by Sixto Carrera, a song with lyrics that resembled her own experiences on the streets. She eventually joined the controversial music group Peña Ferrando of Augusto Ferrando.

Lucha Reyes was briefly married to a policeman.

==Art==

Reyes acted sporadically in theater plays around Lima and would later go on to act in a movie named &quot;Una Carta al Cielo&quot; (&quot;A Letter to Heaven&quot;) by Salvador Oda, about a boy whose dead mother (voiced-over by Reyes) would speak to him. Lucha performed in various acts, living on art in a bohemian style, and produced music favored by the military nationalist government, who encouraged the diffusion of the Peruvian cultural expressions through mass media.
In 1970, helped by Nilo Marchand, manager of the record label FTA (Fabricantes Técnicos Asociados), Reyes recorded her greatest success, &quot;Regresa&quot; (&quot;Come Back&quot;) by Augusto Polo Campos, a number-one international hit. On the success of &quot;Regresa&quot;, Reyes recorded her first LP and, soon after, began her only international tour.

==Last days==

She was diagnosed with tuberculosis and diabetes. The diabetes left her blind. She had cardiac complications and alcoholism.

Lucha Reyes asked composer Pedro Pacheco to write &quot;Mi Última Canción&quot; (&quot;My Last Song&quot;). On October 30, 1973, one day before her death, she sang &quot;My Last Song&quot; at a well-known local radio broadcasting station. On the following day, October 31, 1973, Lucha Reyes, &quot;La Morena de Oro del Perú&quot; (Peru&#x27;s Golden Black Woman) died. She is buried in the Cementerio El Ángel in Lima.

==Legacy==

Lucha Reyes and the ensemble Los Morochucos made a name for black performers among the leading interpreters of the vals criollo and marinera genres. The vals criollo derives from the Viennese waltz. The music is not originally African -Peruvian, but was converted by phrasing lyrics and playing the vals criollo with slightly off-beat accents. The addition of the cajón to the traditional instrumentation of two guitars served to give the vals an African -Peruvian dimension. Marinera songs honor the sailors who fought in the war with Chile and are played with two guitars, a cajón, and accompanied by hand clapping.

Songs such as &quot;¿Qué Importa?&quot; of Juan Mosto (&quot;What Does It Matter?&quot;), with lyrics like &quot; yet another failure is but a drop of water in the ocean for me &quot; were made famous by Lucha Reyes. Her songs were rich with Peruvian Nationalism and criollo pride.
October 31, the anniversary of her death, coincides with the annual celebration of the &quot;Día de la Canción Criolla&quot; (Day of the Creole Song) in Peru.

<text>Carisbrook (sometimes incorrectly referred to as Carisbrook Stadium) was a major sporting venue in Dunedin, New Zealand. The city&#x27;s main domestic and international rugby union venue, it was also used for other sports such as cricket, football, rugby league and motocross. In 1922, Carisbrook hosted the first international football match between Australia and New Zealand. The hosts won 3–1.

Carisbrook also hosted a Joe Cocker concert and frequently hosted pre-game concerts before rugby matches in the 1990s. In 2011 Carisbrook was closed, and was replaced as a rugby ground by Forsyth Barr Stadium in North Dunedin, and as a cricket ground by University Oval in Logan Park.

==History==
Located at the foot of The Glen, a steep valley, the ground was flanked by the South Island Main Trunk Railway and the Hillside Railway Workshops, two miles southwest of Dunedin city centre in the suburb of Caversham. State Highway 1 also ran close to the northern perimeter of the ground.

Carisbrook was named after the estate of early colonial settler James Macandrew (itself named after Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight). Developed during the 1870s, it was first used for international cricket in 1883, when Otago hosted a team from Tasmania, and for Test cricket from 1955. It hosted rugby union internationals from 1908.

Floodlit since the 1990s, it could cater for both day and night fixtures. Known locally simply as &quot;The Brook&quot;, it was branded with the name &quot;The House of Pain&quot;, due to its reputation as a difficult venue for visiting rugby teams. The stadium was home to both the Highlanders in Super Rugby and Otago in the ITM Cup through each side&#x27;s respective 2011 season. It also hosted 38 All Blacks test matches.

It is also the former home of Otago cricket, which moved to the University Oval at Logan Park in the north of the city after its redevelopment in the early 2000s. Between 1884 and 2008 Carisbrook hosted 252 first-class cricket matches, including, between 1955 and 1998, 10 Test cricket matches.

It was also the home ground of Otago United in the New Zealand Football Championship, which moved to the lower-capacity Sunnyvale Park for the 2008–09 season.

The ground&#x27;s final regular capacity was around 30,000, but it hosted crowds as high as 42,000 with temporary seating. Until 1998 the sides of the Caversham bypass motorway allowed a free view of the ground and was known as the &quot;Scotsman&#x27;s Grandstand&quot;. Occasionally trains would slow to a crawl or stop on the track above the stadium, allowing passengers to watch. In 1998 a new stand and corporate boxes were built that blocked the view.

Partly due to Dunedin&#x27;s relatively large number of tertiary students (20,000 of the city&#x27;s 120,000 population), Carisbrook had a unique atmosphere. This was enhanced by the terraces, an uncovered concrete embankment at the eastern end of the ground.

==Retirement and recycling==
On 9 August 2006, a proposal was announced that would see Carisbrook retired and a 30,000 capacity covered stadium built in Dunedin North, close to other major sporting facilities such as Logan Park and the University Oval. Construction and ownership of the new $NZ 198 million stadium, officially named the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza, would be overseen by the Carisbrook Stadium Trust. Until the new stadium was completed, all international and Super Rugby games were still held at Carisbrook.

The last international game was expected to be the All Blacks versus South Africa Tri Nations match on 12 July 2008. However, the All Blacks returned to Carisbrook to play France on 13 June 2009 and finally Wales on 19 June 2010. This game meant that the All Blacks had played every major test-playing nation at Carisbrook. A later test match, destined to be the last at the ground, was scheduled between New Zealand and Fiji as a fundraiser for the Christchurch earthquake appeal on 22 July 2011.

On 11 May 2011 the Dunedin City Council decided that Carisbrook would be sold after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Demolition work was begun at the start of 2012, with the floodlight towers being dismantled and sent up to Christchurch for use by the new temporary Christchurch Rugby Stadium at Addington Showgrounds, to allow that city a first-class ground while AMI Stadium awaits rebuilding. Originally the floodlights were to be reused at the University Oval for day/night cricket matches. The corporate box stand, which was only 14 years old, was always designed to be dismantled for use elsewhere, and there are proposals to move parts of the structure to University Oval and some to Queenstown&#x27;s Stadium. The turnstile building on Neville Street is a category I historic building and would be protected during any potential developments on the site.

Carisbrook was sold to the Dunedin City Council in 2009 for $7,000,000. It was sold on in 2013 for $4,700,000.

<doc id="1088913" wikidata="Q1193414" url="?curid=1088913" title="Oodnadatta">
<text>Oodnadatta is a small, remote outback town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia, located north-north-west of the state capital of Adelaide by road or direct, at an altitude of . The unsealed Oodnadatta Track, an outback road popular with tourists, runs through the town.

Town facilities include a hotel, caravan park, post office, general stores, police station, hospital, fuel and minor mechanical repairs. The old railway station now serves as a museum. From the 1880s to the 1930s, Oodnadatta was a base for camel drivers and their animals, which provided cartage when the railway was under construction and along outback tracks before roads were established.

After the railway line was lifted, Oodnadatta&#x27;s role changed from that of a government service centre and supply depot for surrounding pastoral properties to a residential freehold town for Aboriginal families who, moving from cattle work, bought empty houses as their railway employee occupants left.

==Origin of name==
Two meanings of the name are recorded. One derives from the Aboriginal word &quot;utnadata&quot;, meaning &quot;yellow blossom of the mulga&quot;. However, mulga trees do not grow anywhere near the town. The alternative meaning is &quot;coodnadatta&quot; or &quot;kudnadatta&quot;, meaning &quot;dead man&#x27;s poo&quot;: the first two syllables encompass &quot;rotten&quot; or &quot;excreta&quot; and the second two refer to &quot;there&quot;.

== History ==

For tens of thousands of years, Aboriginal tribes visited the place where Oodnadatta is located as a reliable source of water on their trade route; there was no settlement at Oodnadatta itself. John McDouall Stuart explored the region in 1859. His route was generally followed by the surveyors of the Overland Telegraph Line, completed in 1872. Alfred Giles referred to a place called the Yellow Waterhole, or Angle Pole, later known as Hookey&#x27;s Waterhole and The Peake, near Oodnadatta. The course chosen for the Central Australia Railway likewise followed the route because a water supply was essential for steam locomotives. From 1891, Oodnadatta was an important station on the railway until the line closed in 1981, to be replaced in 2004 by the Adelaide–Darwin rail corridor about to the west.

===Telegraphs, camels and railways===
Angle Pole () is the point near Oodnadatta where the direction of the telegraph line changed to a more northerly direction. It is near the Peake cattle station, also known as &quot;The Peake&quot;, or Freeling Springs. The ruins of Peake telegraph station exist on the station today. Alfred Giles refers to his only meeting with the explorer Ernest Giles (no relation) at &quot;the Peake&quot; in the 1870s.

By the 1880s the telegraph route was being used by camel trains, many led by &quot;Afghan&quot; cameleers (actually from many different places in the Indian subcontinent), or&quot;″Ghans&quot;, as they became known, who were brought to Australia for the task of hauling goods into Central Australia for pioneer settlers. Many of the cameleers settled in Oodnadatta and Marree, some with families and some marrying, mainly Aboriginal women.

In the 1880s, Angle Pole was identified as the proposed terminus for the extension of the Great Northern Railway. When the railway was built, a town was established here, and in October 1890 was proclaimed a government township and renamed Oodnadatta.

In 1889, Angle Pole was also proposed as the south-eastern terminus of a land grant railway from Roebuck Bay in Western Australia. This railway was proposed by a London syndicate and would have been about 1000 miles (1600 km) long, with the wider gauge. However this was never built.

The town remained the terminus of the Great Northern Railway until the line was extended to Alice Springs in 1929 and the railway&#x27;s name was changed to the Central Australia Railway. The railway was built with narrow gauge () tracks, and train traffic was frequently disrupted by washouts and other damage to the trackbed, leading to a slow and unreliable service. The railway through Oodnadatta was closed and a new standard gauge line was built to the west, bypassing Oodnadatta, and opening in October 1980.

===World War II===
Oodnadatta&#x27;s busiest era was World War II when the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force set up local facilities to service troop trains and aircraft en route to Darwin.

===21st century===
Tourist traffic along the Oodnadatta Track and the mining industry keep the village alive. The Aboriginal school is the biggest employer.

In 2018, the federal government announced a major upgrade to the Track, to better serve both the tourists and truck drivers on this major freight and cattle transport route.

In 2023, a reverse osmosis water desalination plant was installed in the town, giving it access to treated drinking tap water for the first time. The town&#x27;s drinking water supply was previously untreated groundwater from the Great Artesian Basin, which the state government warned residents to avoid as early as the 1980s due to the risk of the rare life-threatening brain infection primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.

== Access, facilities, attractions ==

Oodnadatta can be reached by an unsealed road from Coober Pedy or via the unsealed Oodnadatta Track from Marree to Marla or from the north via Finke/Aputula, NT (on the &quot;Old Ghan Heritage Trail&quot;).

The Pink Roadhouse (so-called because it is painted bright pink) provides petrol, a general store, meals, a variety of accommodation, and post office facilities. The Transcontinental Hotel, built in the 1890s, is on the same side of the road, as is the caravan park.

Oodnadatta is serviced twice weekly by the Coober Pedy Oodnadatta One Day Mail Run. The OKA mail truck also carries some general freight and passengers.

The air strip adjacent to the town, originally built during World War II, has a sealed surface.

===Historic buildings===
The historic Oodnadatta railway station, now a museum, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

==Oodnadatta Aboriginal School==
The Oodnadatta Aboriginal School, located in Kutaya Terrace, is a school operated by the Government of South Australia offering education from Reception to Year 12. In 2018, the school had a total enrolment of 14 students, of whom 86% were indigenous, and a teaching staff of three.

== Climate ==
Oodnadatta has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The town&#x27;s position in the Outback causes large seasonal variation. Average maxima vary from in January to in July while average minima fluctuate between in January and in July.
Mean average annual precipitation is very low: , spread between 34.4 precipitation days. The town is very sunny, with 182.5 clear days and only 59.1 cloudy days per annum. There is a large sign in Oodnadatta claiming the town is &quot;The driest town, the driest state of the driest Continent&quot;. 

Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 16 July 1979 to on 2 January 1960, the highest reliably measured maximum temperature in Australia. This record stood unequalled until 13 January 2022, when a temperature of 50.7 °C (123.3 °F) was measured in Onslow, Western Australia, thus equalling Oodnadatta&#x27;s record. A higher temperature was recorded at Cloncurry in 1889; however, this has since been shown to have been recorded in a non-standard enclosure and likely to have been considerably cooler than first believed.

==Governance==
Oodnadatta is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia and the state&#x27;s Far North region. In the absence of a local government authority, the community in Oodnadatta receives municipal services from a state government agency, the Outback Communities Authority.

==Oodnadatta on Mars==
The name Oodnadatta has been used as a name for a crater on the planet Mars.

<text>William McCormack (27 April 1879 – 21 November 1947) was Premier of Queensland, Australia, from 1925 to 1929.

== Early life ==
McCormack was born on 27 April 1879 in St Lawrence, Queensland. He was the fourth of six children born to Mary (née Brennan) and Patrick McCormack; his mother was born in Ireland. His father owned a small grazing property, having previously worked as a carrier.

McCormack was educated at a local state school and subsequently worked as a prospector in the area around Mount Morgan. He moved to North Queensland in 1904 and worked on the Stannary Hills Tramways. He developed a friendship with Ted Theodore who introduced him to the labour movement. In 1908, McCormack became the inaugural vice-president of the Amalgamated Workers&#x27; Association of North Queensland (AWA). He led successful industrial action on the Etheridge railway line and oversaw a rapid increase in membership.

In 1909, McCormack was elected as the full-time paid secretary of the AWA, having been blackballed by employers due to his union activities. He became &quot;North Queensland&#x27;s most influential industrial leader&quot;, working towards amalgamations of smaller unions in line with the One Big Union ideal. He led a successful strike of sugar workers in 1911, reaching a favourable settlement on wages and employment conditions. He initially lent support to the 1912 Brisbane general strike, but considered the pretext for the strike to be flimsy and soon withdrew, gaining a reputation for pragmatism. The AWA merged into the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU) in 1913 with McCormack becoming a vice-president of the AWU.

== Politics ==
McCormack entered politics as member for Cairns in the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the election of 1912, a seat he held until his retirement from politics in 1930.

After the 1915 state election, McCormack missed out upon a place in the ministry but was instead elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. He held the position until 1919 and then was appointed home secretary in Ted Theodore&#x27;s government. In 1923 he instead became secretary of public lands.

In February 1925, McCormack was defeated by William Gillies in the ballot to succeed Theodore as ALP leader and premier. However, Gillies lasted only eight months in the position and was succeeded by McCormack in October 1925. He led the ALP to victory at the 1926 state election.

== Later life ==
McCormack died in Brisbane on 21 November 1947 and was buried at the Toowong Cemetery. His funeral cortege proceeded from his Annerley residence to the cemetery.

<doc id="1088921" wikidata="Q2211147" url="?curid=1088921" title="Magic circle">
<text>A magic circle is a circle of space marked out by practitioners of some branches of ritual magic, which they generally believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection, or both. It may be marked physically, drawn in a material like salt, flour, or chalk, or merely visualised.

==Techniques==

Traditionally, circles are believed by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between themselves and what they summon. One text known as the Heptameron says of the circle, &#x27;But because the greatest power is attributed to the circles; (for they are certain fortresses to defend the operators safe from the evil spirits); in the first place we will treat concerning the composition of a circle.&#x27;

Moreover, as magician and historian Jake Stratton-Kent writes, &#x27;In short a circle is not an obsolete symbol of a superstitious fear of spirits, but an intentionally created ritual space for various purposes. It is not always required for all kinds of ritual work, but neither is it of no value, quite the contrary. Making sacred space is among the most primal of rituals, such intentional actions are as worthy of the term psychoactive as any substance.&#x27;

Circles may or may not be physically marked out on the ground, and a variety of elaborate patterns for circle markings can be found in grimoires and magical manuals, often involving angelic and divine names. Such markings, or a simple unadorned circle, may be drawn in chalk or salt, or indicated by other means such as with a cord. Some traditions include tracing or circumambulation.

==Uses==
=== In Sumer ===
The Sumerians called the practice of using ritual circles &quot;zisurrû&quot;, meaning &quot;magic circle drawn with flour&quot;, and inscribed &quot;-a&quot;. This was an ancient Mesopotamian method of delineating, purifying and protecting from evil by the enclosing of a ritual space in a circle of flour. It involved ritual drawings with a variety of powdered cereals to counter different threats and is accompanied by the gloss: , Akkadian: &quot;māmīt māmīt&quot;, the curse from a broken oath, in &quot;The Exorcists Manual&quot;, where it refers to a specific ritual on two tablets the first of which is extant.

=== In Judaism ===
Examples of Jewish customs showing the use of the magic circle can be found in the birth protection rituals of Alsace and the surrounding area. As early as 1560, a text by the rabbi Naphtali Hirsch ben Elieser Treves notes a custom in which a circle is drawn around the birthing woman to protect her from Lilith and demons. This was done using a Krasmesser (circle knife) which would be wielded by the midwife or the father of the child. Paul Christian Kirchner’s description of Jewish birthing customs from 1734 includes an illustration showing a knife or a sword near the bed, and likewise Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz describes a sword placed near the pregnant woman in the eighteenth century, indicating the likelihood that this custom continued through the centuries. Oral accounts from 20th century Baden-Württemberg in a publication by the Jewish Museum of Switzerland also reference circling movements with a knife in order to protect a woman in childbirth. 

===In the Golden Dawn===
The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which has had one of the largest influences on contemporary Western esotericism, introduced the practices of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram and the Opening by Watchtower. The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) is typically used as a daily practice and is also performed before any magical working, while the Watchtower ritual is much more involved. Both rituals are now used by a wide array of practitioners, including ceremonial magicians, Hermetic Qabalists, Neopagans, and Thelemites.

===In Wicca===
In Wicca, as also in traditional European grimoires, a magic circle is typically nine feet in diameter, though the size can vary depending on the purpose of the circle, and the preference of the caster. 

Some varieties of Wicca use the common ceremonial colour attributions for &#x27;quarter candles&#x27;: yellow for air in the east, red for fire in the south, blue for water in the west and green for earth in the north (though these attributions differ according to geographical location and individual philosophy).

The common technique for raising energy within the circle is by means of a cone of power.

The barrier is believed to be fragile, so that leaving or passing through the circle would weaken or dispel it. This is referred to as &quot;breaking the circle&quot;. It is generally advised that practitioners do not leave the circle unless absolutely necessary.

In order to leave a circle and keep it intact, Wiccans believe a door must be cut in the energy of the circle, normally on the east side. Whatever was used to cast the circle is used to cut the doorway, such as a sword, staff or knife (athame), a doorway is cut in the circle, at which point anything may pass through without harming the circle. This opening must be closed afterwards by reconnecting the lines of the circle.

The circle is usually closed by the practitioner after they have finished by drawing in the energy with the athame or whatever was used to make the circle including their hand (usually in a widdershins: that is, counter-clockwise fashion). This is called &#x27;closing the circle&#x27; or &#x27;releasing the circle&#x27;.

<text>Salmond College is a residential college affiliated to the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. As an affiliated college, it is privately owned and is run independently from the university, being governed by The Council of Knox College and Salmond College, a body with links to the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand. The college was opened in 1971 as Salmond Hall, originally to accommodate women students, to parallel the male-only facility Knox College. It became a coeducational facility during the 1970s. The name was changed to Salmond College in 2006.

Salmond and Knox share different parts of the same 4.57 hectare landscaped site (11 acres), located on the north side of the Dunedin Botanic Gardens, close to the area known simply as The Gardens Corner at the foot of North East Valley, approximately 15 minutes walk north of the campus. The site was originally the location for stables for Ross and Glendining Limited, and was donated by the Ross family.

The college predominantly provides for first year students, with 20-30 returning for a second year. 

The college was named after James Salmond, for many years a lecturer at Knox Theological Hall, and his sister Mary Salmond, Principal of the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Deaconess Training School in the 1950s.

The majority of students are housed in single rooms on one of the four levels in the main building. RLs, known at Salmond “Residential Leaders” are also students who live on site and mentor and support the first year residents. Both the Head and Deputy Head of College reside on the premises. 

Facilities include a gym, computing facilities, tutorial rooms, a library, television/recreation areas, dining hall, chapel, car-parking, and secure cycle storage.

During the summer of 2014/2015 Salmond College was extensively refurbished, creating rooms for up to 261 residents. All bedrooms were double glazed with new carpet and joinery throughout the College. 

President of Salmond College for 2024 is Hannah Hickey. Hannah hails from Wellington,and has returned in 2024, she is studying Nursing at Otago Polytechnic.

Salmond&#x27;s motto which can be seen in the college crest is &#x27;Gratia et Veritas&#x27;, or &#x27;Grace and Truth&#x27;. At the end of 2020 a whakatauākī was confirmed as a part of the mission statement for the college: Ko te toa i a tini, i a mano o te takata - It is the bravery of a multitude, of thousands of people. This Ngāi Tahu whakatauākī, attributed to Tū Whakauika &amp; Te Oreorehua, refers to the strength of collectivity. As Salmond enters its 50th year in 2021, it reminds us of the power of a living community stretching back several generations, and fosters hope as we continue to grow a community with a shared identity. 

Salmond College is the hall of legends and has produced very iconic friend groups. If you have gone there, you have witnessed greatness. Up The Mond.

<text>Dennis Geoffrey Jensen (born 28 February 1962) is an Australian former politician. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2004 federal election, winning the Division of Tangney for the Liberal Party. Jensen lost Liberal preselection for the 2016 federal election, and subsequently resigned from the party to stand as an independent. In August 2017 he joined the fledgling Australian Conservatives party. Jensen has a PhD in materials science from Monash University, and before entering politics worked as a CSIRO researcher. He is known for questioning the anthropogenic causation of climate change.

== Early life==
Jensen was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was educated at RMIT University, the University of Melbourne and Monash University, from where he has a PhD in materials science. He worked at the CSIRO as a research scientist and for the Department of Defence as a defence analyst before entering politics.

== Politics ==
Jensen was the Liberal candidate for the Division of Corio, Victoria at the 1998 election.

In 2006, Jensen lost his preselection for Tangney for the 2007 federal election, but won it back with the support of the state executive and prime minister John Howard. He lost preselection again for the 2010 election, but once again the state executive intervened and restored him as Liberal candidate. 

Jensen rejects the scientific consensus on human-induced global warming and, on behalf of the Lavoisier Group, organised the release of a book entitled &quot;Nine Facts About Climate Change&quot; by former mining CEO Ray Evans. In February 2007 during a Parliamentary sitting, Jensen quoted the then IPCC vice chairman Yuri Izrael, who had stated that &quot;there is no proven link between human activity and global warming&quot;.

His reputation as a [climate sceptic] became national when he and four government colleagues disagreed with others of their party in a dissenting committee report regarding climate change.

Jensen boycotted Parliament on the day that the formal apology to the Stolen Generations was made by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. He further courted controversy by telling Australian Indigenous people claiming to be affected by European colonisation over 200 years ago to &quot;get over it.&quot; He was one of six Liberal MPs (including fellow West Australian MPs Wilson Tuckey, Luke Simpkins and the late Don Randall as well as Peter Dutton, Sophie Mirabella and the late Alby Schultz) to leave the house (or boycott entirely) in protest to the apology to the Stolen Generations.

He is opposed to same-sex marriage in Australia.

===Lost Liberal pre-selection===
Jensen lost Liberal preselection in Tangney for the 2016 federal election. It was revealed he had written a technothriller, falsely portrayed as a work of erotic fiction, named &quot;The Skywarriors&quot; in which Indonesia invades Australia. Former party state director Ben Morton won preselection. Jensen sued the Australian newspaper and Andrew Burrell, the journalist, for defamation. He won the case, and was paid a total of $1.1 million, including costs.

In August 2017, Jensen sent an email to former Liberal colleagues, saying he had joined the Australian Conservatives party started by Cory Bernardi, and urging them to follow him.

<text>Ross Xavier Vasta (born 8 October 1966) is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives since 2010, representing the Division of Bonner for the Liberal Party. He previously held the same seat from 2004 to 2007.

==Early life==
Vasta is the son of Angelo Vasta, a former judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland who was stood down after his friendship with the disgraced Queensland Police Commissioner Terence Lewis became known. His parents were both born in Innisfail, Queensland, while his grandparents were all born in Sicily. His mother registered him as an Italian citizen by descent when he was a child, but he renounced it prior to his first run for parliament in 2001. Vasta was educated at Villanova College in the Brisbane suburb of Coorparoo, and attended Griffith University, where he graduated with a commerce degree. He ran and operated three family-owned Italian cuisine restaurants named Elio&#x27;s and worked as a company director before entering politics. He is the brother of Salvatore Vasta, a controversial judge of the Federal Circuit Court, with significant controversy surrounding several of his cases.

==Politics==
At the 2001 federal election, Vasta was the Liberal Party candidate for the Division of Griffith. He was defeated by the sitting member, Kevin Rudd, who later became Prime Minister of Australia.

In the 2004 federal election, Vasta stood for the Liberals in the Division of Bonner, and defeated former Labor minister Con Sciacca. However, in the 2007 election he was defeated by Labor candidate Kerry Rea on a swing of 4.75 points, the lowest swing against a Liberal incumbent in Queensland. Following his election defeat, Vasta won Liberal Party preselection for the Brisbane City Council ward of Wynnum-Manly in Brisbane&#x27;s east. He was defeated by the Labor incumbent, polling 36% of the primary vote.

Vasta decided to stand in Bonner once again at the 2010 federal election, and reclaimed his old seat by a 53% to 47% margin. He achieved a seven-point swing towards him, one of the highest of any Liberal candidate in Queensland.

Vasta was nominated to the speaker&#x27;s panel in 2013 and has served as chair of the standing committees on privileges and parliamentary procedure. In 2015 he was a candidate to succeed Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Vasta is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party, after previously being aligned with the centre-right faction during the Morrison government years.

<doc id="1088952" wikidata="Q166960" url="?curid=1088952" title="Turkish Delight (1973 film)">
<text>Turkish Delight () is a 1973 Dutch erotic romantic drama film directed by Paul Verhoeven from a screenplay by Gerard Soeteman, based on the 1969 novel &quot;Turks Fruit&quot; by Jan Wolkers. It is a love story of an artist and a young woman, starring Rutger Hauer in his film debut and Monique van de Ven.

&quot;Turkish Delight&quot; is the most successful film in the history of Dutch cinema. The film was a massive success at the Dutch box office; according to Alle Record, 3,338,000 people saw the film, while the Netherlands Film Festival puts it at 3.5 million, corresponding to about 26% of the population of the Netherlands at the time. In 1973 it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and in 1999, it received a special Golden Calf Award for Best Dutch Film of the Century. It was entered into the Canon of Dutch Cinema in 2007. In 2005, it was adapted into a musical, starring Antonie Kamerling and Jelka van Houten.

==Plot==
Sculptor Eric Vonk wakes up recalling disturbing dreams where he murders characters still unknown to the audience. He eventually cleans up his dingy studio, but only to trawl the streets of Amsterdam in search of random women whom he takes back home for sex. This combination of violent fantasies, promiscuity and occasional misogyny is not intrinsic to him, but rather the outcome of a distressing memory: his failed relationship with Olga Stapels. The film then flashes back two years to the time they first met.

Olga picks up Eric when he is hitchhiking, and they immediately have sex in her car. This first tryst is followed by a traffic accident, and Eric is initially prevented from seeing Olga again by her middle-class mother, who strongly dislikes him and blames him for the crash. However, the two lovers reconnect and start a passionate affair which, while opposed by her mother, is seen sympathetically by her easy-going father. They eventually get married, and Olga&#x27;s mother and closest circle of friends grudgingly accept Eric.

Sometime later, Eric lands a 5000-guilder commission to prepare a sculpture for the garden of the hospital where his friend Paul works. Olga models for the statue, which is unveiled by the Dutch queen. The unveiling ceremony is successful for the hospital, but the artist and model are prevented from attending on the front line by the queen&#x27;s security detail because of Olga&#x27;s revealing dress. Out of frustration, Eric and Olga throw the maquettes into the canals of Amsterdam.

Olga&#x27;s father dies from illness shortly thereafter. Instead of taking care of the Stapels family business, Eric then takes Olga back to Amsterdam, where he continues his artistic career and she takes a job in a production line. This infuriates Olga&#x27;s mother, who feels that a Bohemian sculptor earning little from occasional commissions is an unsuitable husband.

Eric and Olga&#x27;s life together, while initially happy, is marred by bouts of strange behavior by Olga, including unexplainable reveries and rampant impulsivity. This tendency reaches a pitch of conflict at a family gathering in a Chinese restaurant. Eric finds himself insidiously baited into following Olga to the party, where he witnesses her flirting openly with a family friend, with the overt complicity of the rest of the diners. This prompts Eric to vomit over the attendants and slap Olga. She then leaves Eric, who proceeds to trash his studio, destroying anything that reminds him of her. This brings the movie to the point where it opened, ending the flashback.

Eric is still obsessed with Olga. Her family refuses to let him visit her until he says he has come to arrange a divorce. His short stay sours when Olga&#x27;s mother walks in on them having rough sex, and he is banished from her life permanently. Olga later becomes engaged to a wealthy American and visits Eric to pick up the remainder of her things before leaving for the United States. Eric comes to terms with her departure, and his closure is symbolized by a minor subplot in which he rescues a wounded seagull and sets it free once its wing heals.

Sometime later, Eric walks into a commercial center and spots Olga, flamboyantly dressed and acting oddly. She reveals that her American experience was a disaster and that she is living with her mother again. She suddenly collapses and Eric takes her to Paul&#x27;s hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a brain tumor. Surgical intervention to remove the tumor is not entirely successful, and her death becomes an inevitable matter of course. Eric brings her a wig and Turkish delight, which is the only thing she will eat, as she fears harder food will break a loose tooth. Soon after, she has a seizure and dies. Eric walks outside, past his sculpture of Olga, and solemnly dumps her wig in a trash disposal.

<doc id="1088954" wikidata="Q3521631" url="?curid=1088954" title="The Lonely Position of Neutral">
<text>The Lonely Position of Neutral is the debut album by American rock band Trust Company. It was released on July 22, 2002 internationally and on July 23, 2002, in the United States; a version including two bonus tracks was released on February 19, 2003. &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; is Trust Company&#x27;s most successful album to date and was certified gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies. The track &quot;Drop to Zero&quot; was also known as &quot;The Lonely Position of Neutral&quot; back when the band was known as 41Down, and was later remade for this album.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Downfall,&quot; was released in 2002. It gained the band its breakthrough popularity for both its infectious melody and unusual music video. The track reached number six on both the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and earned a spot at number 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart. The video features front-man Kevin Palmer walking down a street, with everything behind him blown away by wind. It found significant airplay on MTV2. &quot;Running from Me&quot; was the second single from the album and released in the same year. Its video features the band wearing strange masks and unveiling them in the pouring rain. The third single, &quot;The Fear&quot;, was released in 2003.

== Critical reception ==

Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic commended the band for sticking with the nu-metal formula to create tracks that are recognizable and contain elements of pop punk but was unsure of their career long-term when compared to similar acts like Linkin Park, concluding that &quot;This is a shame, because those willing to give this album a chance will find one of the most infectious alternative metal albums of 2002.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Barry Walters was adamant of the instrumentation throughout the album, saying that it follows &quot;modern-rock-radio conventions&quot; but said that &quot;the singing&#x27;s understatement and harmonic sophistication help the band transcend overblown corporate rock and embrace sensitive emo pop.&quot;

<doc id="1088955" wikidata="Q6688848" url="?curid=1088955" title="Louise Markus">
<text>Louise Elizabeth Markus (born 6 September 1958) is a former Australian politician who served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives, initially elected to represent the seat of Greenway in western Sydney for the Liberal Party of Australia at the 2004 federal election. Following an unfavourable redistribution in 2010, she moved to the seat of Macquarie. She lost the 2016 federal election to Labor&#x27;s Susan Templeman.

==Early years and background==
She was educated at the University of New South Wales, graduating in social work, and was a community worker running the Hillsong Church&#x27;s drug and alcohol outreach service in Blacktown prior to entering politics.

==Political career==
Subsequent to the 2004 election, unsubstantiated allegations were made in the NSW Parliament under parliamentary privilege that Markus had directly benefited from unauthorised campaign materials containing false statements in an attempt to capture anti-Islamic sentiment against her Labor opponent. These allegations were not supported as the basis for his loss by the Labor candidate nor supported by contemporary media coverage.

At the 2007 federal election, Markus retained the seat of Greenway with a comfortable margin, although with a nominal swing of 6.85 points against her on a two-party-preferred basis. Following the election, Markus was appointed as the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship, but did not retain the position in a 2010 reorganisation of the shadow ministry. She was previously the Shadow Minister for Veteran&#x27;s Affairs.

A September 2006 redistribution of boundaries saw massive changes in the shape of her electorate of Greenway. The northward shift in electorate boundaries also saw Greenway change from marginal Liberal to safe Liberal. A further electoral redistribution in 2009 made the seat of Greenway notionally Labor on an estimated margin of 5.7%. Markus contested the 2010 federal election as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Macquarie, which had absorbed a fraction of her former electorate base. Markus won the two-party-preferred vote by 2.52 points against Labor, with most support in her traditional base in the urban east of the electorate, and high Greens votes in the smaller upper Blue Mountains booths. The 2013 federal election was marked by widespread swings towards the Liberal Party in western Sydney. In this context, Markus further extended her margin, winning with a primary vote of 47.4% and a two-party-preferred vote of 54.5%. As before, the electorate demonstrated a marked polarity, with her support being in the more urban northern and eastern portions of the electorate.

At the 2016 federal election, the incumbent Markus lost the seat of Macquarie to three-time challenger, Susan Templeman. Activist group GetUp! claimed to have played a significant role in the outcome as they targeted Markus in a direct electoral campaign. This included the distribution of how to vote material favouring Green and Labor candidates.

==Personal==
Markus lives in Riverstone. She is married to Jim Markus, who is from Papua New Guinea; together they have two children.

<doc id="1088957" wikidata="Q1808397" url="?curid=1088957" title="Masonite">
<text>Masonite, also called Quartboard or pressboard, is a type of engineered wood made of steam-cooked and pressure-molded wood or paper fibers. The fibers form a stiff, dense material in a range of weights.

The process was formulated and patented by American inventor William H. Mason.

Masonite has been widely used in traditional school and office products such as spiral-bound notebooks and three-ring binders, but its unique physical characteristics lend itself readily to a variety of end-uses, including (but not limited to) document storage, filing supplies (classification and file folders), report covers, folding cartons, tags, labels, and industrial applications.

== History ==

In 1898, a product resembling Masonite (hardboard) was first made in England by hot-pressing waste paper.

In 1924, Masonite was patented in Laurel, Mississippi, by William H. Mason, who was a friend and protégé of Thomas Edison.

In 1929, the company initiated mass production of its product.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Masonite was used for applications including doors, roofing, walls, desktops, guitars (e.g., Danelectro), and canoes. It was sometimes used for house siding. Similar &quot;tempered hardboard&quot; is now a generic product made by many forest product companies.

In 1972, the Masonite Corporation entered the door business as a supplier of facings.

In 1982, the Masonite Corporation spun off its timber property. In 1984, USG acquired Masonite. In 1988, USG sold Masonite to International Paper.

In 2001, the Masonite Corporation was purchased by Premdor Corporation, a door maker, from its former parent International Paper. It no longer supplies generic hardboard.

== Production ==

Masonite is formed using the Mason method, in which wood chips are disintegrated by saturating them with steam, then increasing the steam or air pressure to and suddenly releasing them through an orifice to atmospheric pressure. Forming the fibers into boards on a screen, the boards are then pressed and heated to form the finished product with a smooth burnished finish. (Later a dry process with two burnished surfaces was also used.) The original lignin in the wood serves to bond the fibers without any added adhesive. The long fibers give Masonite a high bending strength, tensile strength, density, and stability. Unlike other composite wood panels, no formaldehyde-based resins are used to bind the fibers in Masonite.

== Materials ==

Masonite may contain recycled fiber content (including post-consumer waste), and is typically itself recyclable and biodegradable, making it an environmentally-sound choice for those seeking an alternative to petroleum-derived substrates.

Masonite has also been made from cornstalks.

== Use ==
Artists have often used it as a support for painting, and in artistic media such as linocut printing. Masonite&#x27;s smooth surface makes it a suitable material for table tennis tables and skateboard ramps.

Masonite is used by moving companies. Among other things, they use it to protect the walls of buildings where they work, and lay on floors to enable smooth rolling of dollies loaded with goods.

Masonite was used as rear cover in many consumer electronics, into the early 1980s. It was more heat resistant than contemporary cheap plastic which was especially important for vacuum tube TVs and radios which generated high levels of heat in extended use. The electrical insulation properties were considered particularly useful for safety. Later, it was displaced in these applications, as more suitable plastics were developed.

== Deterioration ==

Masonite swells and rots over time when exposed to the elements, and may prematurely deteriorate when it is used as exterior siding. In 1996, International Paper (IP) lost a class action suit brought by homeowners whose Masonite siding had deteriorated. The jury found that IP&#x27;s Masonite siding was defective.

<text>David Julian Fawcett (born 23 October 1963) is an Australian Liberal Party politician who has been a Senator for South Australia since 2011. Fawcett served in the Morrison government as Assistant Minister for Defence from 2018 to 2019.

Fawcett was previously elected to federal parliament, serving for one term as member for the House of Representatives seat of Wakefield in South Australia, elected at the 2004 election.

==Early life==
Fawcett was born on 23 October 1963 in Narrabri, New South Wales. His family is originally from Kapunda, South Australia. He spent part of his childhood in Thailand where his father had been sent under the Colombo Plan. He returned to Australia in 1975 to attend Prince Alfred College in Adelaide.

==Military service==
Fawcett graduated from the Royal Military College Duntroon with a Bachelor of Science in 1985. He joined the Australian Army Aviation Corps and qualified as a pilot, flying fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. He qualified as a test pilot through the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in 1993 and was a senior flying instructor at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre, finishing his full-time military service in 2004. He was posted to Royal Australian Air Force Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at Edinburgh, South Australia as an Army helicopter test pilot. He held a number of positions in ARDU and the Defence Acquisition Organisation, culminating in his final appointment as Commanding Officer, responsible for flight test programs for all of the Australian Defence Force aircraft. He reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before leaving the ADF to enter politics.

==Parliament==
Prior to the 2004 election, the seat of Wakefield had been dramatically altered in a redistribution. The seat had long been a safe rural Liberal seat stretching from the Yorke Peninsula through to the Riverland and the state&#x27;s border, but upon the abolition of the safe metropolitan Labor seat of Bonython, Wakefield was moved to take in the outer northern Adelaide suburb of Elizabeth and part of Salisbury, spanning through to the rural mid-north town of Clare—roughly a fifth the size of its former incarnation. The Liberals held the old Wakefield with a comfortably safe two-party margin of 14.6 points, but the new Wakefield was notionally a marginal Labor seat with a two-party margin of just 1.3 points. The previous Liberal member, Neil Andrew, believed this made Wakefield unwinnable and opted not to recontest the seat in 2004. However, Fawcett narrowly defeated the Labor candidate, ex-Bonython MP Martyn Evans, on a swing of 2.2 points, taking the seat on Family First preferences. Despite an extensive campaign at the 2007 election, Fawcett was defeated by Labor&#x27;s Nick Champion, suffering a large swing of 7.2 points.

Fawcett was elected as a Liberal Senator in South Australia at the 2010 election and assumed his seat on 1 July 2011.

He served as deputy Government whip in 2014-2016, then from 2016 to 2022. Fawcett has served extensively in Parliamentary committees, chairing Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade while in government, then as Deputy Chair while in opposition.

Fawcett is a member of the National Right faction of the Liberal Party, after previously being aligned with the Centre-Right faction during the Morrison government years.

==Personal life==
Fawcett is married with two children. He has been involved in leadership positions at Clovercrest Baptist Church in Modbury North, Adelaide and Tyndale Christian School in Salisbury East, Adelaide. He has been a contributing member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the Australian Flight Test Society.

<doc id="1088962" wikidata="Q2389288" url="?curid=1088962" title="Escape from Colditz">
<text>Escape from Colditz is a board game produced by Gibsons Games of London in 1973 that simulates attempted escapes by Allied prisoners-of-war (POWs) from Oflag IV-C (better known as Colditz Castle) during World War II. Designed in part by Pat Reid, a former POW who escaped from Colditz, the game was released during the first run of the popular television series &quot;Colditz&quot;, and the game likewise proved popular. Licensed editions were published by Parker Brothers and a number of other companies. The game proved especially popular in Spain, and resulted in a Spanish-language sequel. 

==Description==
&quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; is a board game for 2–6 players in which one player takes on the role of the German security officer at Colditz, and the other players represent the various nationalities of POWs being held there who are trying to find the means to escape.

===Components===
The game box contains:
* The game board, covered with a grid of linked circles, is a pictorial plan of Colditz Castle showing the inner and outer courtyards, various rooms, safe areas, cells, and barracks.
* Five sets of eight tokens representing five nationalities of POWs.
* One set of sixteen black tokens representing the German guards.
* Five &quot;Personal Escape Kit&quot; cards
* Five &quot;Do or Die&quot; cards 
* 27 &quot;Escape Equipment&quot; cards
* 45 &quot;Escape Opportunity&quot; cards
* 14 &quot;Security Opportunity&quot; cards
* rules sheet
* two six-sided dice
* historical account of the castle&#x27;s role as a POW camp during World War II

===Set up===
* One player agrees to be the German Security Officer, and places some of the black tokens on designated spots on the board, and the rest in the barracks. The other players are Escape Officers; each chooses one of the nationalities of POWs and places their tokens on indicated spots on the Parade Ground in the inner courtyard. (The number of guards and POWs will vary according to the number of players.)
* A &quot;Do or Die&quot; card is dealt facedown to each Escape Officer. This card remains facedown and unknown to all until played.
* A time limit is agreed to by all players, as well as the number of successful escapes required for victory.

===Gameplay===
The first active player is the one sitting to the left of the German Security Officer. Play continues around the table to the left, with the Security Officer always moving last.

====Movement====
The active player rolls two dice and can move any or all of their POWs, the total movement of the POWs equaling the total on the dice. If the player rolls doubles, they can roll again and add the second roll to their movement total. If the player rolls a 3, 7 or 11, the player takes an &quot;Escape Opportunity&quot; card (Escape Officer) or &quot;Security Opportunity&quot; card (Security Officer).
====Obtain personal escape kit====
First, Escape Officers must obtain the four elements that make up a Personal Escape Kit: food, disguises, maps, and a compass. Symbols representing these are scattered around the castle in various rooms. An Escape Officer must maneuver POWs so that they are simultaneously in four rooms containing the four different symbols. Once this is accomplished, the Escape Officer receives a &quot;personal Escape Kit&quot; card. The guards at this point do not have the power of arrest, so can only block doorways in an attempt to slow down the POWs.

====Obtain escape equipment====
Each different escape route requires specific pieces of escape equipment. Once an Escape Officer has a Personal Escape Kit, and has decided on a route, they must attempt to pick up the required pieces of equipment, by either moving two POWs into a room with the symbol of the desired piece of equipment, or moving two POWs into two different rooms containing the same symbol. Escape Officers can also obtain desired equipment by trading Equipment cards with other Escape Officers. If a guard sees a POW entering or exiting a forbidden room, a guard can arrest the POW by moving a guard into the same circle as the POW. Likewise, a POW can voluntarily offer themselves up for arrest. The POW is sent to the cells for solitary confinement, while the guard immediately returns to the barracks. If the arrest happens in the outer courtyard, the Escape Officer must forfeit an Equipment card. The POW in the cells is released if the Escape Officer rolls doubles, or plays an appropriate Opportunity card.
====Attempted escape==== 
Once the Escape officer has obtained the proper equipment, one of their POWs can attempt to escape. As each piece of equipment is used in the attempt, the Equipment card is returned to the deck. Once the POW has made it past the castle wall, the POW attempts to get to one of the target areas on the edge of the board as quickly as possible. If the POW successfully reaches a target area without being arrested or shot, the POW is deemed to have escaped.

====Do or die====
As a last resort, an Escape Officer may elect to use the &quot;Do or Die&quot; card, which allows for one escape attempt without the need for any Equipment. Turning over the &quot;Do or Die&quot; card reveals a number between 3 and 7. This is how many dice rolls the player is allowed to make in attempting to move one chosen POW towards a target area. The player rolls the dice the number of times indicated (rolling again if doubles are rolled). If the total of all rolls equals or exceeds the amount of movement the chosen POW needs to reach a target area, the POW successfully escapes. If the amount of movement generated is not enough for the POW to reach a target area, the escape attempt fails and that player is out of the game.

===Victory conditions===
If any player reaches the agreed-to number of successful escapes, the game is over and that player is the winner. If the time limit is reached before any player has made the required number of escapes, the German Security Officer player is the winner.

==Tactics==
In the book &quot;The Games &amp; Puzzles Book of Modern Board Games&quot;, John Humphries suggests that since the German Security Officer wins if the POWs run out of time, it is important to try to delay the POW escape plans by deploying the guards efficiently, watching doors to prevent POWs from entering rooms to gain equipment, especially those doors that gain access to more than one room. Arresting as many prisoners as possible after they have filched equipment puts them in solitary confinement for a period of time, reducing the POWs available to the Escape Officers. Humphries also suggests keeping a written tally of the equipment owned by each Escape Officer to try to analyze which escape route is being contemplated.

For the Escape Officers, Humphries suggests that obtaining their Personal Escape Kit card as soon as possible is essential. He also suggests collecting more escape equipment than is necessary, rather than trying to make do with just enough equipment. Avoiding guards (and subsequent arrest) is essential, but sometimes sending a POW to deliberately get arrested is necessary, since the guard is returned to the barracks after taking the prisoner to the cells, potentially leaving a door unguarded for a second POW to move through. Finally, Humphries suggests that the Escape Officer design several phony escapes as diversions to occupy the guards before unveiling the actual escape plan. Humphries&#x27;s concluding words of advice are, &quot;first, keep on the move and second, plan escape attempts carefully.&quot; 

==Publication history==
In 1972, BBC produced &quot;Colditz&quot;, a television series about Allied POWs imprisoned at the supposedly escape-proof Colditz Castle and their many attempts to escape. The TV series proved popular in the UK, and former Colditz POW and escapee Major Pat Reid, who had written several books about his wartime experiences, co-designed a board game with Bob Brechin and Brian Degas as an official licensed tie-in to the TV series. The game, &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot;, was published in the UK by Gibsons Games in 1973. It was also published in North America by Parker Brothers the same year. The original box of both these editions featured a swastika; in later editions, this was replaced by an &quot;Reichsadler&quot; (Imperial eagle). The game proved to be very popular.

A Spanish edition, &quot;Fuga de Colditz&quot;, sold very well in Spain, and Major Reid designed a sequel, &quot;Después de Colditz&quot; (&quot;After Colditz&quot;), in which the POWs who escaped from Colditz try to make their way to Switzerland, Spain, Sweden or England. 

A new edition of the board game, with new artwork and updated rules, was released in October 2016 by Osprey Games.

In 1972, Invicta Plastics published an unrelated board game designed by 18-year-old Adrian Wild titled &quot;Escape from Colditz Castle&quot;. Although that game proved popular, selling 130,000 copies, it was quickly forgotten once &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; was released by Gibsons Games the following year.

==Video game adaptation==
An Amiga computer game titled &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; was created in 1990 by Digital Magic Software. Based on the board game, it required the player to help four prisoners escape by exploring the castle, finding equipment, solving puzzles and digging a tunnel.

&quot;Colditz Escape!&quot;, an open source game engine recreation of the 1990 Amiga game, was created by Aperture Software in 2009. The engine is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS and PlayStation Portable.

==Reception==
In Issue 29 of &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot;, John Humphries thought the board was &quot;well designed&quot;. He noted that &quot;as the game progresses and escape plans near fruition, it can become quite tense for the players concerned, hoping that they will not be caught at the last minute.&quot; However, Humphries found that &quot;the rules are atrociously compiled, full of errors, omissions and anomalies.&quot; Despite this, he gave the game a rating of 4 out of 6, saying, &quot;&quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; should provide many hours of enjoyment for most members of the family.&quot;

In the book &quot;Achtung Schweinhund!: A Boy&#x27;s Own Story of Imaginary Combat&quot;, journalist Harry Pearson noted the one problem he had with the game: &quot;&quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; was hugely popular, but it had one major defect — someone had to be the Germans. While the Allied players got to run around the castle hoping to nick the stall car, collecting skeleton keys and wire cutters and hoarding Red Cross cigarettes with which to bribe the guards, the German player just marched around with his dogs hoping to fall into a tunnel.&quot;

In &quot;The Games &amp; Puzzles Book of Modern Board Games&quot;, John Humphries said the game &quot;should be played for fun and in fact can be very amusing as well as frustrating and tense at times. Tension can certainly be created when an escape attempt is &#x27;on&#x27;, and hunter and hunted are both in full cry.&quot; He concluded, &quot;The game does not and could not recreate the sense of hopelessness and deprivation experienced by most prisoners of war, but in fairness does not claim to be a true simulation of the actual period, emphasising rather the spirit of co-operation between prisoners.&quot;

<doc id="1088968" wikidata="Q953170" url="?curid=1088968" title="Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)">
<text>María de Luz Flores Aceves (23 May 1906 – 25 June 1944), known by her stage name Lucha Reyes, was a Mexican singer and actress. Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, she was popular in the 1930s and 1940s and was called the &quot;Queen of Ranchera&quot;.

== Early life ==
Reyes, the daughter of Miguel Ángel Flores and Victoria Aceves, lost her father when she was still small. She took the surname Reyes from her mother&#x27;s second husband, who took care of her until she was a teenager. In her early singing career, Soon after, she moved with her family to Mexico City, where they lived in a modest house in Colonia Morelos. Because of the family&#x27;s financial problems, she never finished primary school. Later she joined the church choir at Iglesia de Carmen. Her career began at the age of 13, when she performed in a tent in the Plaza San Sebastián near her house in the Federal District, alternating with comedians like Amelia Wilhelmy, José Limón, and the Acevedo Brothers.

== Career ==

Reyes traveled to the United States to study voice, and in 1920 went on tour to several states, where she became an icon among the local Hispanics. She teamed up with Nancy Torres, and decided to stay in Los Angeles. It was during this tour that she met the journalist Gabriel Navarro, and they were married shortly after. Reyes suffered a miscarriage, lost the child, and they divorced. In 1924, she returned to Mexico.

Reyes would eventually decide to launch a solo career, and she became popular with Mexican radio listeners, while keeping a busy theater schedule. In 1927, she tried to conquer Europe, joining Juan N. Torreblanca on a tour of that continent. It was cancelled when it reached Berlin, for unpublicized reasons. A popular piano player who travelled with them had to play one night at an infamous local bar for her to be able to afford an air ticket back to Mexico. One positive aspect about this tour was that Reyes was able to record her first record, one of the first records to introduce Mexican music to European audiences. Reyes was not a ranchera singer during this period of her career, she was rather a soprano. Reyes had taken light clothing with her for her European tour; this, combined with the cold weathers of Europe when compared to Mexico, caused her to get sick and, eventually, to lose her voice. Her voice ailment was the cause of a voice change, and, upon returning, she started singing &quot;rancheras&quot;. One of her first songs in the ranchera genre, &quot;Guadalajara&quot;, became a classic.

In 1928, Reyes launched a career as a solo artist, and a year later began her best years as an artist, achieving successes with songs like &quot;La Tequilera&quot;, &quot;¡Ay Jalisco, no te rajes!&quot;, &quot;El corrido de Chihuahua&quot;, &quot;El herradero&quot;, &quot;La Panchita&quot;, &quot;Traigo un amor&quot;, &quot;Juan Colorado&quot;, &quot;El castigador&quot;, &quot;Rayando el sol&quot;, &quot;Caminito de Contreras&quot;, and more. In 1930, the entrepreneur Frank Founce contracted with her to perform several concerts on the stage of the Million Dollar Theater in Los Angeles.

Reyes also appeared in films. She played supporting roles in &quot;Con los dorados de Villa&quot; (1939) and &quot;El Zorro de Jalisco&quot; (1941). Her last film appearances were musical guest roles in &quot;¡Ay Jalisco... no te rajes!&quot; (1941) and &quot;Flor silvestre&quot; (1943).

== Personal life and death ==
Reyes married three times. In 1934, she married her second husband, producer Félix Martín Cervantes. At the time of her death, she was married to Antonio Vega Medina, a pilot.

Like many of her contemporary stars, such as Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, José Alfredo Jiménez and Javier Solís, she had a short life. She died on 25 June 1944 of an &quot;acute intoxication&quot; caused by an &quot;unknown substance&quot;, which was believed to be barbiturates.

== Legacy ==
She has a statue in East Los Angeles, California as she visited the city many times during her career. The statue is located in Mariachi Plaza in the east Los Angeles area of the city, a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood.

<text>United States military ration refers to the military rations provided to sustain United States Armed Forces service members, including field rations and garrison rations, and the military nutrition research conducted in relation to military food. U.S. military rations are often made for quick distribution, preparation, and eating in the field and tend to have long storage times in adverse conditions due to being thickly packaged or shelf-stable.

==History==
===18th and 19th centuries===
From the Revolutionary War to the Spanish–American War, the U.S. Army ration, as decreed by the Continental Congress, was the garrison ration, which consisted of meat or salt fish, bread or hardtack, and vegetables.

There was also a spirit ration. In 1785, it was set at four ounces of rum, reduced to two ounces of whiskey, brandy, or rum in 1790. In 1794, troops about to enter combat or who were engaged in frontier service could receive a double ration of four ounces of rum or whiskey; this was extended in 1799 to include troops engaged in fatigue duties. It was discontinued in 1832 and replaced with a ration of coffee and sugar, which was increased in 1836. In 1846, a spirit ration was reinstated for issue to troops engaged in construction or surveying duties; this was discontinued in 1865.

During the American Civil War, both armies struggled to keep their soldiers adequately fed. Difficulties with food logistics led to a multitude of rations.

===World War I===

In World War I three types of rations came into usage by the U.S. military: the &quot;Reserve ration&quot;, the &quot;Trench ration&quot;, and the &quot;Emergency ration&quot; (also known as the &quot;Iron ration&quot;).

====&quot;Iron Ration&quot; (1907–1922)====
The first attempt to make an individual ration for issue to soldiers in the field was the &quot;iron ration&quot;, first introduced in 1907. It consisted of three three-ounce cakes (made from a concoction of beef bouillon powder and parched and cooked wheat), three one-ounce bars of sweetened chocolate, and packets of salt and pepper that were issued in a sealed tin packet that weighed one pound. It was designed for emergency use when the troops were unable to be supplied with food. It was later discontinued by the adoption of the &quot;Reserve Ration&quot;, but experience with the Iron Ration went into the development of the emergency D-ration.

====&quot;Trench Ration&quot; (1914–1918)====
This ration was issued in the early part of the war to address a problem. Soldiers fighting in the front lines needed to be supplied with their daily rations, but cooked food prepared at field kitchens was sometimes spoiled by gas attacks. The trench ration was the answer. It was a variety of canned meats (salmon, corned beef, sardines, etc.) that were commercially procured and sealed in a large tin box covered in canvas. It was bulky and heavy and the soldiers began to get weary of the limited menu and it was soon replaced by the Reserve Ration.

====&quot;Reserve Ration&quot; (1917–1937)====
The reserve ration was first issued during the latter part of World War I to feed troops who were away from a garrison or field kitchen. It originally consisted of 12 ounces of fresh bacon or one pound of canned meat known as the &quot;Meat Ration&quot;, usually corned beef. Additionally, two 8-ounce cans of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, a packet of 1.16 ounces of pre-ground coffee, a packet of 2.4 ounces of granulated sugar, and a packet of 0.16 ounces of salt were issued. There was also a separate &quot;tobacco ration&quot; of 0.4 ounces of tobacco and 10 cigarette rolling papers, later replaced by brand-name machine-rolled cigarettes.
After the war, there were attempts to improve the ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the &quot;Meat Ration&quot; was revised, consisting of one pound of meat (usually a combination of dried beef and canned corned beef). This was supplemented by hard chocolate, 14 ounces of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, coffee, and sugar. In 1925, the &quot;Meat Ration&quot; was changed, removing the dried beef in favor of canned pork and beans, and reducing the bread component. The corned beef allowance was also reduced in size (older rations continued to be issued, however). In 1936, menu planners attempted to introduce more variety by developing an alternate &quot;Meat Ration&quot; consisting of an &quot;A&quot;-menu (canned corned beef) and a &quot;B&quot;-menu (canned pork and beans). The A and B Reserve or combat ration was canceled after being superseded in 1938 by the Field Ration, Type C.

===World War II===

After 1918, the army ration system went through several revisions, eventually leading to the:

* &quot;A-ration&quot;: Garrison ration. Fresh, refrigerated, or frozen food prepared in dining halls or field kitchens. The most valued of all rations.
* &quot;B-ration&quot;: Field ration. Canned, packaged, or preserved foods normally prepared in field kitchens without refrigeration.
* &quot;C-ration&quot;: Individual ration. A complete pre-cooked, ready-to-eat canned individual meal.
* &quot;K-ration&quot;: Individual ration. Designed as a short duration individual &quot;assault&quot; ration for paratroopers and other specialized light infantry forces. Declared obsolete in 1948.
* &quot;D-ration&quot;: Emergency ration. Bars of concentrated chocolate combined with other ingredients to provide high calorie content (intended as an emergency ration).

A-rations were generally whatever meat and produce could be obtained locally, so there could be great variety from one theatre of operations to the next. B-rations were generally used when there was inadequate refrigeration for perishable A-rations. The composition of the D-ration did not change much throughout the war, but the C-ration developed many variations.

A- and B-rations were only served at bases or established camps in rear areas as they require cooking. C-rations could be eaten hot or cold and required no special preparation or storage, so these could be served almost anywhere.

During the war a new ration for assault troops, the &quot;K-ration&quot;, was developed. K-rations were originally intended to be used as short duration rations for only 2–3 days, but cost concerns and later standardization led to its overuse, contributing in some cases to vitamin deficiencies and malnourishment.

There were various other special rations developed for specific circumstances, including: 
* &quot;Type X Ration&quot;
* &quot;5-in-1 ration&quot;
* &quot;10-in-1 food parcel&quot;
* &quot;Mountain ration&quot;: , discontinued 1943
* &quot;Jungle ration&quot;: , discontinued 1943
* &quot;The Assault Lunch&quot;: Chocolate bars, caramels, dried fruit, chewing gum, peanuts, salt tablets, cigarettes, matches, and water purification tablets; total of , discontinued 1947
* &quot;The Assault ration&quot; (Pacific Theater): 28 pieces of assorted hard candy, chewing gum, cigarettes and a chocolate peanut bar
* &quot;The Aircrew Lunch&quot;
* &quot;The AAF Combat Lunch&quot;
* &quot;Parachute Emergency Ration&quot;
* &quot;Liferaft Ration&quot;
* &quot;Airborne Lifeboat Ration&quot;

===Cold War rations===
Some of these specialized rations were discontinued during the war due to cost concerns, forcing commanders to adopt standardized rations in their place. The K- and D-rations were declared obsolete after World War II, but canned wet rations in the form of the C-ration (later the MCI) continued until 1983, when they were replaced by the Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). Created during this era was the T-ration (or &quot;T-rat&quot;), a semi-perishable meal packaged, heated, and served in a tray pack similar to frozen meals.

== Present-day issuance ==

Currently, the following rations are available to troops:

* &quot;Unitized Group Ration&quot;: standard group ration for field kitchens and garrisons, succeeding the A-, B-, and T-rations
** &quot;UGR-H&amp;S&quot; (&quot;Heat &amp; Serve&quot;): precooked, shelf-stable meals designed to be heated and served in less than an hour
** &quot;UGR-A&quot;: fresh meals prepared on-site (or nearby and transported), requiring refrigeration and a field kitchen
** &quot;UGR-M&quot; (formerly &quot;UGR-B&quot;): meals, mostly dehydrated or preserved, intended for the U.S. Marine Corps
** &quot;UGR-E&quot; (&quot;Express&quot;): meals in self-heating packages designed to feed groups where field kitchens are unavailable
** &quot;Navy Standard Core Menu&quot;: meals served to U.S. Navy personnel aboard navy vessels; considered a group ration, but not part of the UGR system
* &quot;Meal, Ready-to-Eat&quot;: standard individual field ration
* &quot;First Strike Ration&quot;: individual ration designed for use in combat or while moving
* &quot;Soldier Fuel&quot;: specialized energy bar found in some MREs

The composition of these rations are predetermined in a way to make sure that soldiers are properly fed and equipped with the necessary nutrients in order to maximize energy levels. There are certain levels of nutrients that are recommended by the Military Nutrition Research Committee. As a baseline, it is recommended that there be at least 2,400 kcal in each ration, in which those rations are constructed of different levels of numerous vitamins and nutrients.

== Ration waste disposal ==
The military prioritizes the burn disposal of the waste because, if not taken care of properly, it can lead to more problems. The goal achieved from the proper disposal includes the elimination of vermin problems, airborne diseases, and preventing any enemy militaries from obtaining the waste to use as resources for themselves or as intelligence.

<doc id="1088971" wikidata="Q10860200" url="?curid=1088971" title="Stop-and-wait ARQ">
<text>Stop-and-wait ARQ, also referred to as alternating bit protocol, is a method in telecommunications to send information between two connected devices. It ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order. It is the simplest automatic repeat-request (ARQ) mechanism. A stop-and-wait ARQ sender sends one frame at a time; it is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with transmit and receive window sizes equal to one in both cases. After sending each frame, the sender doesn&#x27;t send any further frames until it receives an acknowledgement (ACK) signal. After receiving a valid frame, the receiver sends an ACK. If the ACK does not reach the sender before a certain time, known as the timeout, the sender sends the same frame again. The timeout countdown is reset after each frame transmission. The above behavior is a basic example of Stop-and-Wait. However, real-life implementations vary to address certain issues of design.

Typically the transmitter adds a redundancy check number to the end of each frame. The receiver uses the redundancy check number to check for possible damage. If the receiver sees that the frame is good, it sends an ACK. If the receiver sees that the frame is damaged, the receiver discards it and does not send an ACK—pretending that the frame was completely lost, not merely damaged.

One problem is when the ACK sent by the receiver is damaged or lost. In this case, the sender doesn&#x27;t receive the ACK, times out, and sends the frame again. Now the receiver has two copies of the same frame, and doesn&#x27;t know if the second one is a duplicate frame or the next frame of the sequence carrying identical DATA.

Another problem is when the transmission medium has such a long latency that the sender&#x27;s timeout runs out before the frame reaches the receiver. In this case the sender resends the same packet. Eventually the receiver gets two copies of the same frame, and sends an ACK for each one. The sender, waiting for a single ACK, receives two ACKs, which may cause problems if it assumes that the second ACK is for the next frame in the sequence.

To avoid these problems, the most common solution is to define a 1 bit &quot;sequence number&quot; in the header of the frame. This sequence number alternates (from 0 to 1) in subsequent frames. When the receiver sends an ACK, it includes the sequence number of the next packet it expects. This way, the receiver can detect duplicated frames by checking if the frame sequence numbers alternate. If two subsequent frames have the same sequence number, they are duplicates, and the second frame is discarded. Similarly, if two subsequent ACKs reference the same sequence number, they are acknowledging the same frame.

Stop-and-wait ARQ is inefficient compared to other ARQs, because the time between packets, if the ACK and the data are received successfully, is twice the transit time (assuming the turnaround time can be zero). The throughput on the channel is a fraction of what it could be. To solve this problem, one can send more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number and use one ACK for a set. This is what is done in Go-Back-N ARQ and the Selective Repeat ARQ.

<text>Poetry (founded as Poetry: A Magazine of Verse) has been published in Chicago since 1912. It is one of the leading monthly poetry journals in the English-speaking world. Founded by poet and arts columnist Harriet Monroe, who built it into an influential publication, it is now published by the Poetry Foundation. In 2007 the magazine had a circulation of 30,000, and printed 300 poems per year out of approximately 100,000 submissions. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Poetry—Chicago&quot;.

&quot;Poetry&quot; has been financed since 2003 with a $200 million bequest from philanthropist and Lilly heiress, Ruth Lilly.

==History==
The magazine was founded in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, an author who was then working as an art critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. She wrote at that time:

&quot;The Open Door will be the policy of this magazine—may the great poet we are looking for never find it shut, or half-shut, against his ample genius! To this end the editors hope to keep free from entangling alliances with any single class or school. They desire to print the best English verse which is being written today, regardless of where, by whom, or under what theory of art it is written. Nor will the magazine promise to limit its editorial comments to one set of opinions.&quot;
In a circular she sent to poets, Monroe said the magazine offered:
&quot;First, a chance to be heard in their own place, without the limitations imposed by the popular magazine. In other words, while the ordinary magazines must minister to a large public little interested in poetry, this magazine will appeal to, and it may be hoped, will develop, a public primarily interested in poetry as an art, as the highest, most complete expression of truth and beauty.&quot;
&quot;In the first decade of its existence, [&quot;Poetry&quot;] became the principal organ for modern poetry of the English-speaking world.&quot; T. S. Eliot&#x27;s first professionally published poem, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,&quot; was published in &quot;Poetry&quot;. &quot;Prufrock&quot; was brought to Monroe&#x27;s attention by early contributor and foreign correspondent, Ezra Pound. The magazine published the early works of H.D., Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Marianne Moore. The magazine discovered such poets as Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and John Ashbery.

Contributors have included William Butler Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, William Carlos Williams, Joyce Kilmer, Carl Sandburg, Charlotte Wilder, Robert Creeley, Wallace Stevens, Basil Bunting, Yone Noguchi, Carl Rakosi, Dorothy Richardson, Peter Viereck, Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, E. E. Cummings, Frank O&#x27;Hara, Allen Ginsberg, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Elsa Gidlow, and Tennessee Williams, Max Michelson among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the Imagist and Objectivist poetic movements.

A. R. Ammons once said, &quot;the histories of modern poetry in America and of &quot;Poetry&quot; in America are almost interchangeable, certainly inseparable.&quot; However, in the early years, East Coast newspapers made fun of the magazine, with one calling the idea &quot;Poetry in Porkopolis&quot;.

Author and poet Jessica Nelson North was an editor. Henry Rago joined the magazine in 1954 and became editor the following year.

The magazine first established its online presence in 1998 at poetrymagazine.org and, after a 2003 grant from Ruth Lilly, moved to poetryfoundation.org in 2005.

Publication in &quot;Poetry&quot; is highly selective and consists of three increasingly critical editorial rounds. With a publication rate of submissions at about 1%, the magazine is &quot;one of the most difficult to get [published in]&quot;.

==Lilly grant==
===Foundation===
Monroe continued to publish the magazine, until her death in 1937. From 1937 to 1941, a group series of editors published the magazine. From 1941, until the establishment of the Foundation in 2003, the magazine&#x27;s publisher went by the corporate name, the Modern Poetry Association. In 2003, the association received a grant from the estate of Ruth Lilly originally said to be worth over $100 million, but which grew to be about $200 million when it was given out. The grant added to her already substantial prior contributions.

The magazine learned in 2001 that it would be getting the grant. Before announcing the gift, the magazine waited a year and reconfigured its governing board, which had been concerned with fund-raising. The Poetry Foundation was created, replacing the Modern Poetry Association, and Joseph Parisi, who was editor of the magazine for two decades, briefly headed the foundation. Christian Wiman, a young critic and poet, succeeded to the editorship in 2003.

Since receiving the grant, the magazine has increased its budget. For instance, poets who previously received two dollars per line now get ten. In addition, the magazine continues to give out eight annual author prizes for various types of publications that have appeared in the magazine, these range per endowment from $500 to $5000.

===Poetry Foundation Building===
Part of the Lilly grant was used to build the Poetry Center in Near North Side, Chicago. The Center, opened in 2011, holds a library open to the public, houses reading spaces, hosts school and tour groups, and provides office and editorial space for the Poetry Foundation and magazine.

==Editorship under the Poetry Foundation==

Christian Wiman took the editorship in 2003. Partly thanks to direct-mail campaigns, the magazine&#x27;s circulation has grown from 11,000 to almost 30,000. The look of the magazine was redesigned in 2005.

Wiman &quot;expressed in print a stern preference for formal poems, and a disdain for what he calls &#x27;broken-prose confessionalism&#x27; and &#x27;the generic, self-obsessed free-verse poetry of the seventies and eighties&quot;, according to a &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine article.

One of his top goals for the magazine was to get more people &quot;talking about it&quot;, he has said. &quot;I tried to put something in every issue that would be provocative in some way.&quot; Wiman hired several young, outspoken critics and encouraged them to be frank. In 2005, Wiman wrote in an editorial: &quot;Not only was there a great deal of obvious logrolling going on (friends reviewing friends, teachers promoting students, young poets writing strategic reviews of older poets in power), but the writing was just so polite, professional and dull. ... We wanted writers who wrote as if there were an audience of general readers out there who might be interested in contemporary poetry. That meant hiring critics with sharp opinions, broad knowledge of fields other than poetry, and some flair.&quot;

Wiman stepped down from the editorship June 30, 2013. Poet Don Share, senior editor under Wiman, became the Editor. Share stepped down in the summer of 2020, following a controversy over his decision to include a poem with racist language in an issue devoted to anti-racist poetry. After a series of guest editors, poet Adrian Matejka, a writing professor, and past Indiana State Poet Laureate, was named editor in 2022.

==Controversial article by John Barr==

In September 2006, the magazine published an essay by John Barr, then president of the Poetry Foundation (2003–13), titled &quot;American Poetry in the New Century,&quot; which became controversial, generating many complaints and some support. After having heard a talk Barr gave on the subject, Wiman had asked Barr to submit it to the magazine.

&quot;American poetry is ready for something new because our poets have been writing in the same way for a long time now. There is fatigue, something stagnant about the poetry being written today,&quot; Barr wrote. He added that poetry is nearly absent from public life, and poets too often write with only other poets in mind, failing to write for a greater public. Although M.F.A. programs have expanded greatly, the result has been more poetry but also more limited variety. He wrote that poetry has become &quot;neither robust, resonant, nor — and I stress this quality — entertaining.&quot;

Barr suggested that poets get experience outside the academy. &quot;If you look at drama in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, or the novel in the last century, or the movie today, it suggests that an art enters its golden age when it is addressed to and energized by the general audiences of its time.&quot;

Dana Goodyear, in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reporting and commenting on &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine and The Poetry Foundation, wrote that Barr&#x27;s essay was directly counter to the ideas of the magazine&#x27;s founder, Harriet Monroe, eight decades before. In a 1922 editorial, Monroe wrote about newspaper verse: &quot;These syndicated rhymers, like the movie-producers, are learning that it pays to be good, [that one] gets by giving the people the emotions of virtue, simplicity and goodness, with this program paying at the box-office.&quot; Monroe wanted to protect poets from the demands of popular taste, Goodyear wrote, while Barr wants to induce poets to appeal to the public. Goodyear acknowledged that popular interest in poetry has collapsed since the time of Monroe&#x27;s editorial.

Wiman has said he agrees with many of Barr&#x27;s points about contemporary poetry.

==Awards==
In 2011, and in 2014, &quot;Poetry&quot; won National Magazine Awards for General Excellence.

==Legacy==
A Beirut-based literary magazine, &quot;Shi&#x27;r&quot;, was named after Poetry.

<text>Lake Hāwea is New Zealand&#x27;s ninth largest lake located on the South Island in the Otago Region at an altitude of 348 m. It covers 141 km2 and is 392 m deep.

Lake Hāwea is named after a Māori tribe who preceded the Waitaha people in the area.

Lake Hāwea stretches 35 km from north to south. It lies in a glacial valley formed during the last ice age, and is fed by the Hunter River. Nearby Lake Wānaka lies in a parallel glacial valley 8 km to the west. At their closest point, a rocky ridge called The Neck, the lakes are only 1 km apart.

Lake Hāwea is dammed to the south by an ancient terminal moraine created 10 000 years ago. In 1958, the lake was artificially raised 20 metres to store more water for increased hydroelectric power generation at the Roxburgh Dam.

The only flat land around the lake is at its southern end, surrounding its outflow into the Hāwea River, a short tributary of the Clutha 
/ Matau-au, which it joins near Albert Town. The settlement of Lake Hāwea is found at the lake&#x27;s southern shore.

The lake is a popular resort, well used in the summer for fishing, boating and swimming. The nearby mountains and fast-flowing rivers allow for adventure tourism year-round, such as jetboating and skiing.

==Māori history==

For Māori, the Wānaka and Hāwea area was a natural crossroads. The Haast Pass led to the West Coast and its pounamu; the Cardrona Valley led to the natural rock bridge &quot;Whatatorere&quot; which was the only place that the Kawarau River and Clutha River / Mata-Au could be crossed without boats. reed boats enabled a swift return downriver to the east coast.

The Cromwell basin supported a large population of moa, which were hunted to extinction about 500 years ago.

Until the early nineteenth century, the area was visited annually by Ngāi Tahu who sought pounamu in the mountains above the Haast River and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending the Clutha River / Mata-Au in reed boats. Ngāi Tahu use of the land was ended by attacks by North Island tribes. In 1836, the Ngāti Tama chief Te Pūoho led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass: they fell on the Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and Lake Hāwea, capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children. Although Te Pūoho was later killed by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Tūhawaiki, Maori seasonal visits to the area ceased.

The first European to see the lake was Nathanael Chalmers in 1853. Guided by Reko and Kaikōura, he walked from Tuturau (Southland) to the lakes via the Kawarau River. He was stricken by dysentery, so his guides returned him down the Clutha in a reed boat.

== Namesakes ==
There have been three Royal New Zealand Navy ships named after the lake, one of which is still in active service.

<text>The second USS &quot;Hamilton&quot; (DD–141) was a in the United States Navy following World War I, later reclassified DMS-18 for service in World War II.

==Namesake==

Archibald Hamilton was born c. 1790, the son of Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton. He was appointed Midshipman on 18 May 1809 and assigned to work with a new kind of hollow shot needed by frigate . He next sailed for Europe on on 31 January 1811 carrying dispatches for American officers in the Mediterranean. On his return to the United States, Hamilton was assigned to on which he won commendation from his commanding officer, Captain Stephen Decatur, for gallantry in action during the capture of British frigate on 25 October 1812. Decatur selected him to bear the captured British flags to Washington.

Appointed Acting Lieutenant on 21 December 1812 and Lieutenant on 24 July 1813, Hamilton served throughout the War of 1812, only to be killed shortly after the Treaty of Ghent had formally ended the war. Because of the slow communications of the day, word of peace had not reached New York by 15 January 1815 when the frigate , commanded by Captain Decatur and having Hamilton as one of her lieutenants, ran the blockade out of that port. The next day British men-of-war , and overtook and captured &quot;President&quot; after a long and bloody running fight in which Hamilton was killed. He was the last U.S. Navy officer to die in the War of 1812.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hamilton&quot; was launched on 15 January 1919 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, sponsored by Miss Dolly Hamilton Hawkins, great-grand-niece of Archibald Hamilton. The ship was commissioned on 7 November 1919.

==Service history==
Based at San Diego, &quot;Hamilton&quot; participated in battle practice and maneuvers along the California coast with Destroyer Squadron 17. In mid-1920 she also took part in torpedo and smoke screen operations in Hawaii. Battle practice and other readiness operations ranging across the Pacific to Hawaii continued until &quot;Hamilton&quot; decommissioned at San Diego on 20 July 1922.

&quot;Hamilton&quot; recommissioned on 20 January 1930 and, after shakedown, reached her new home port, Norfolk, on 26 November. She served with the Scouting Force, operating along the East Coast throughout 1931, and then returned to San Diego in January 1932. After a year of plane guard duty and battle exercises along the California coast, &quot;Hamilton&quot; again shifted to the East Coast, reaching Norfolk on 29 January 1933. Based at Newport, Rhode Island, she served with the Scouting Force in local operations and exercises.

In 1938 an activated-tank stabilization system designed by Nicolas Minorsky was tested in &quot;Hamilton&quot; but exhibited control stability problems. The outbreak of World War II in Europe in late 1939 interrupted further development as &quot;Hamilton&quot; was called to active duty. &quot;Hamilton&quot; joined other members of her class on the Grand Banks Patrol, which sent American ships as far north as Iceland and Greenland to protect their own and neutral shipping. &quot;Hamilton&quot; continued this duty until converted to a fast minesweeper in June 1941. Reclassified DMS-18 on 17 October 1941, she resumed patrol duty along the East Coast and into the North Atlantic.

===World War II===
When the United States was catapulted into the war on 7 December 1941, &quot;Hamilton&quot;″s pace accelerated greatly. Wartime duties now took &quot;Hamilton&quot; on coastal convoys from New York through German U-boat-infested waters as far south as the Panama Canal Zone.

The Caribbean Sea and the waters off Cape Hatteras were particularly rich ground for U-boats, and &quot;Hamilton&quot; more than once attacked U-boats sighted on the surface or detected by sound contacts. On 9 June 1942 &quot;Hamilton&quot; rescued 39 survivors of , torpedoed just north of Bermuda.

The shifting tide of war drew &quot;Hamilton&quot; from the coastal convoy route in the fall of 1942 as she became part of &quot;Operation Torch,&quot; the Allied invasion of North Africa. &quot;Hamilton&quot; sailed for North Africa on 24 October with Rear Admiral H. K. Hewitt&#x27;s Task Force 34, a part of the Allied amphibious thrust. Two weeks later, she cruised off the Moroccan coast providing antisubmarine (ASW) protection and fire support for the first waves of invasion barges as the Allies landed at Casablanca, Oran, and Algiers on 8 November 1942.

&quot;Hamilton&quot; remained along the North African shore on minesweeping and escort duty out of Casablanca until December when she sailed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, arriving 26 December. The following year saw &quot;Hamilton&quot; engaged primarily in coastal convoy duty, guiding and protecting merchantmen as they threaded their perilous way through German submarine packs from Iceland to the Caribbean.

Departing Norfolk on 3 December 1943, &quot;Hamilton&quot; transited the Panama Canal five days later and reached San Diego on 16 December. From San Diego she steamed to Pearl Harbor and, after a brief training period, sailed for Kwajalein Atoll, a key target in the Marshalls. As the Marines stormed ashore there on 31 January 1944, &quot;Hamilton&quot; steamed in the area to screen transports and provide the fire support that made it possible to land and stay.

After the successful conclusion of that invasion, &quot;Hamilton&quot; retired to Nouméa, New Caledonia, to prepare for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands. At Nouméa, &quot;Hamilton&quot; joined forces with three other destroyers converted to fast minesweepers-, , and —to form a preliminary sweep unit. It was the mission of these ships to enter enemy harbors three to five days before landings to clear out mines and provide safe anchorage for the invasion force. The toll of these operations, conducted before enemy shore batteries had been taken out, was high. Of her original unit only &quot;Hamilton&quot; survived the war.

Under enemy fire, &quot;Hamilton&quot; and her group entered Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands on 2 March 1944 to begin sweeping operations. After the invasion was launched, she remained in the area screening transports and patrolling on ASW duty until early April when she returned to Nouméa to prepare for the invasion of Aitape. After sweeping operations there before the 22 April invasion, &quot;Hamilton&quot; served on general sweeping duty in the Solomons and then readied for the Mariana campaign.

Entering Saipan Harbor on 13 June, &quot;Hamilton&quot; helped clear the way for the invasion. The conquest of Saipan was followed by the assault on Guam. The day organized enemy resistance on Saipan ended, &quot;Hamilton&quot; sailed from Eniwetok on 9 July to take part in the preliminary bombardment and sweeping activities at Guam. This time a long period on the firing line preceded &quot;Hamilton&quot;″s entrance into the harbor. Then three days before the invasion on 21 July, she started to sweep the harbor. After screening transports in the retirement area, &quot;Hamilton&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor for repairs.

&quot;Hamilton&quot;″s next tour of minesweeping duty fell at Peleliu Island. Arriving off the Palaus on 12 September 1944, &quot;Hamilton&quot; joined her unit and proceeded through several heavily mined channels. In Kossol Passage, the converted destroyers exploded 116 mines. For destroying three extensive minefields, which the Japanese had hoped would ward off or severely damage the invasion force, &quot;Hamilton&quot; and the other minesweepers received the Navy Unit Commendation. Then, after duty in the transport screen, she escorted convoys from the staging areas to the Palaus to prepare for the assault on the Philippine Islands.

She departed Manus on 10 October and entered Leyte Gulf on 17 September. Three days before Army divisions came ashore, &quot;Hamilton&quot; swept the channels around Diriagat Island and Looc Bay to clear the way to the invasion beaches. To add to the usual turmoil of the invasion, the fleet as a whole was under almost constant air attack. In the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Imperial Japanese Navy was virtually annihilated; the Japanese lost three battleships, four carriers, six heavy and four light cruisers, and nine destroyers. American losses were two escort carriers, a light carrier, and three destroyers. This battle marked the end of Japanese sea power as an important threat. The fleet had cleared the way for the final assaults leading into Japan.

Arriving at Manus, Admiralty Islands on 31 October, &quot;Hamilton&quot; underwent availability and repairs and, once more ready for battle, sailed on 23 December to prepare the way for the invasion of Lingayen Gulf. As the minesweepers steamed through the channel on 6 January 1945, wave after wave of &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked. &quot;Hamilton&quot; emerged from the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks unscathed. After the invasion forces landed at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January, &quot;Hamilton&quot; remained as a transport screen and escort until 1 February when she sailed for Saipan.

From Saipan, the veteran ship again steamed into battle, this time appearing off Iwo Jima. &quot;Hamilton&quot; recorded no casualties during sweeping operations which began on 16 February, but she had to aid , left powerless by a direct bomb hit on 18 February. In addition to helping the wounded ship fight myriad fires, &quot;Hamilton&quot; took on board and care for the more seriously injured sailors. After marines stormed ashore on Iwo Jima on 19 February, &quot;Hamilton&quot; patrolled off the island until on 27 February. The four-stacker then returned to Iwo Jima as a convoy escort 7 March. Three days later &quot;Hamilton&quot; sailed from the battle and from the Pacific War. Steaming for Eniwetok, she changed course to rescue 11 men from a downed Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft on 11 March.

&quot;Hamilton&quot; reached Pearl Harbor via Eniwetok on 25 March 1945 and, after a brief period of training, headed back to the continental United States. As she sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge on 8 April, the destroyer ended over 100,000 miles of steaming in the Pacific. Scheduled for and modernization, she went into drydock at Richmond, California; but she was subsequently reclassified AG-111 (miscellaneous auxiliary) on 6 May 1945 and taken out of dry dock. The ship spent the few remaining months of the war participating in experimental minesweeping work along the California coast out of Santa Barbara. Two weeks before the Japanese surrender, &quot;Hamilton&quot; sailed to the destroyer base at San Diego, where she was decommissioned on 16 October 1945. Her hulk was sold to Hugo Neu of New York City for scrapping on 21 November 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Hamilton&quot; earned nine battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Dave Spikey (born David Gordon Bramwell, 6 October 1951) is an English comedian, actor, writer and film producer. He is best known for his stand-up comedy, writing and starring in the British comedy programme &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, presenting &quot;Bullseye&quot; and &quot;Chain Letters&quot;, and serving as team captain for the first four series of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, Spikey spent his early career working as a biomedical scientist in the haematology laboratory at Bolton General Hospital. It was during this period in the 1980s that he scripted and performed in a number of amateur pantomimes with a group of like-minded health workers called the Bolton Health Performers.

Early in his career Spikey won a talent show called Stairway to the Stars with a routine about juggling on a motorbike, judged by comedian Larry Grayson who took him aside to tell him he had potential and his routine was fantastic. Spikey was inspired to pursue a part-time comedy career while working at Bolton General Hospital.

In 1992, Spikey was asked to form a double act with Rick Sykes, purely as a &#x27;one-off&#x27; to support a popular musical duo called &#x27;Intaglio&#x27;. Dave and Rick were known as Spikey and Sykey. The double act&#x27;s most notable success came on Central TV&#x27;s &quot;New Faces&quot; show.

In 1993, Spikey was voted &quot;best up and coming comedian&quot; by the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

In 1996, Spikey first met Peter Kay, with whom he would later collaborate, at the North-West Comedian of the Year Awards, which Kay won that year and Spikey was compèring.

He was the final host of UK gameshow &quot;Chain Letters&quot; in 1997, following on from Jeremy Beadle, Andrew O&#x27;Connor, Allan Stewart, Ted Robbins and Vince Henderson.

===Success===
Spikey won the Best Newcomer award at the British Comedy Awards, and then co-wrote and starred in &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; on Channel Four as Jerry St. Clair. In 2003, Spikey released his first DVD, &quot;The Overnight Success Tour&quot;. 2003 was also the year he won ‘Best Comedy Performance at Leicester Comedy Festival 2003’, an award he describes as “the weirdest trophy I’ve got on my shelf.”

In late 2004, he wrote the ITV comedy-drama &quot;Dead Man Weds&quot; (2005), in which he also co-starred with Johnny Vegas. The drama follows the attempts of the new editor (Spikey) of the local newspaper, &quot;The Fogburrow Advertiser and News&quot;, to drum up excitement in the area to cover in his paper, to the disdain and disinterest of his lead (and only) reporter (Vegas). Nancy Banks-Smith described the drama as &quot;endearing and cheerful&quot;.

In 2005, Spikey became one of the regular team captains on the comedy panel game, &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, leaving before the 2007 series. That year also saw the release of his second live DVD, &quot;Living the Dream&quot;.

In 2006, Spikey became the host of a revived version of the darts-based quiz show &quot;Bullseye&quot;. The show ran for two series on Challenge to generally unfavourable reviews, &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling it an &quot;abhorrent reboot&quot;.

Spikey developed two new projects which were commissioned by the BBC: &quot;Magnolia&quot;, a sitcom about painters and decorators, and &quot;Footballers Lives&quot; – a comedy about a pub football team, neither made it beyond pilots. He was also on the panel for talent show &quot;When Will I Be Famous?&quot; He returned to stand-up and live shows again and has regularly released DVDs of his shows. His chosen subject on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; in 2006 was human blood; he won.

In 2010, Spikey was voted into the Channel 4 &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups&quot; by the British public.

In 2017, he appeared as a self-obsessed businessman, Mr Gruff, in British romantic comedy film &quot;Finding Fatimah&quot;.

Spikey celebrated 30 years in stand-up with a new retrospective, &quot;Juggling on a Motorbike&quot; which began touring in 2017. The title refers to his first live performances which began his career in comedy, a routine which he recreates at the end of his show. The show is largely autobiographical and follows his performances over the past 30 years of stand-up.

===Other interests===
Spikey was patron of the non-profit radio station Chorley FM (not to be confused with the fictitious radio station made famous by &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;). The radio station was closed down in 2019.

Spikey&#x27;s first book, &quot;He Took My Kidney, Then Broke My Heart&quot;, was published in October 2009 by Michael O&#x27;Mara Books. This was followed in 2010 by an autobiography, &quot;Under the Microscope: My Life&quot; from the same publisher.

Spikey is a supporter of the League Against Cruel Sports and appeared in a short film for the group in 2013. He has been quoted: &quot;It is shocking to think anyone would want to turn the clock back to a time when chasing animals to exhaustion and encouraging them to be ripped apart by a pack of dogs for sport was legal.&quot; He describes himself as a “devout vegetarian and animal lover” as well as being the patron of Pet Rehome, a Bolton-based animal rescue centre.

<text>Vasil Pavlovich Mzhavanadze (; – 31 August 1988) was a Georgian Soviet politician who served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Georgian SSR from September 1953 to September 28, 1972 and a member of the CPSU&#x27;s Politburo from June 29, 1957 to December 18, 1972. Dismissed after a corruption scandal, he was replaced by Eduard Shevardnadze.

== Career ==
Vasili Mzhavanadze was born in Kutaisi. He left school at the age of 12 and was a factory worker for ten years. In 1924, he joined the Red Army. There is no record of his holding an office of any kind in his native Georgia during the next 29 years. He joined the Communist Party in 1927, and after graduating from the Leningrad Military-Political Academy, served as a political commissar during World War II. After the war, he became deputy commander for political affairs in the Kiev military district in the Ukrainian SSR, under the administration of Ukrainian Communist Party leader (and later Soviet leader) Nikita Khrushchev.

Georgia was at this time ruled by supporters of Lavrentiy Beria, who had been the First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party from 1931 to 1938. In July 1953, following the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and the arrest of Beria, the leadership of the Georgian Communist Party was purged by Khrushchev&#x27;s supporters. Mzhavanadze left the army and went back to Georgia to lead the Party, replacing Beria&#x27;s protégé Aleksandre Mirtskhulava as First Secretary in September 1953. In an unprecedented display of military presence on the political arena, Mzhavanadze was joined in the Georgian Central Committee by the generals Alexi Inauri and Aleksei Antonov. When Khrushchev became the leader of the USSR in 1957, Mzhavanadze was appointed to become a candidate (non-voting) member of the Soviet Politburo.

Though Mzhavanadze owed his promotion to Khrushchev, in September 1962, he resisted Khrushchev&#x27;s sudden decision to split local communist party organisations into two parts, with separate first secretaries, one responsible for industry, the other for agriculture. Publicly, Mzhavanadze declared in November 1962 that he &#x27;shared a fully supported&#x27; the reorganisation, but in March 1965, after Khrushchev&#x27;s fall, he claimed to have been in touch at the time with &#x27;many&#x27; members of the Central Committee who had told Khrushchev to his face that the plan would not work. He was one of the small number of high ranking officials who knew in advance that Khrushchev was to be ousted in October 1964.

After Khrushchev&#x27;s fall, Mzhavanadze also seemed to have decided that the exposure of Stalin&#x27;s crimes had gone too far. In June 1965, he arranged for the museum in Stalin&#x27;s birthplace, Gori to be reopened, and praised Stalin&#x27;s remark that &#x27;Our Party is a fortress whose gates open only for tried and true people.&#x27;

Georgia prospered during Mzhavanadze&#x27;s term of office against a background of corruption. Mzhavanadze himself became a symbol of corrupt, inefficient governance. He was accused of auctioning jobs, pocketing state funds and running illegal factories for his own enrichment;

In mid-1972, Mzhavanadze was publicly accused of corruption and was denounced by the state-controlled media. He resigned from his post as First Secretary on September 28, 1972, and was replaced by his ambitious Interior Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze. It has widely been speculated that Shevardnadze had a hand in his boss&#x27;s downfall; he was certainly the obvious candidate to replace Mzhavanadze. On December 18, Mzhavanadze was sacked from his Politburo position and retired to Georgia in disgrace. He died in Moscow in 1988. He was honoured with a state funeral in Tbilisi.

<text>Lake Ōhau is a lake in the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island of New Zealand. The Hopkins and Dobson rivers fed into the northern end of Lake Ōhau. These rivers have their headwaters in the Southern Alps. The lake&#x27;s outflow is the Ōhau River, which travels from the southeast corner of Lake Ōhau and feeds into the Waitaki River hydroelectric project. The Barrier range (and Mount Sutton 2007m in particular) dominate the western side of Lake Ōhau, while the Ben Ohau range dominates the eastern side of Lake Ōhau. At the northern end of the lake, in between the Hopkins and Dobson rivers, lies the Naumann Range of mountains (with Mt Glenmary 2590m being the tallest).

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of Hau&quot; for , but an alternative meaning could be &quot;windy place&quot;.

Ōhau is the smallest of three roughly parallel lakes running north–south along the northern edge of the Mackenzie Basin (the others are Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo). It covers 60 km2.
Lake Ohau Alpine Village is located on the western shore of the Lake.

The lake forms part of the traditional boundary between the Otago and Canterbury regions, Otago&#x27;s northernmost point being the headwaters of the Hopkins River. Officially the lake lies in the northwestern part of the Waitaki District within the southern part of the Canterbury region.

== Location ==
Lake Ōhau is 320 kilometres (four hours drive) south of Christchurch and 275 kilometres (three hours drive) north of Dunedin. It is accessed by turning off State Highway 8 between Twizel and Omarama on to Lake Ōhau Road which arrives at Lake Ōhau after about 17 kilometres.

== Climate ==
The warmest month of the year is February, with an average temperature of 15.4 °C | 59.7 °F. The lowest average temperatures in the year occur in July, when it is around 2.8 °C | 37.0 °F. Monthly rainfall ranges between an average of 57mm in February to 101mm in October. Snow is common in the winter months of June, July and August.

== In Māori culture ==
The legends of Ngāi Tahu speak of Lake Ōhau being one of the lakes dug by the Waitaha explorer Rākaihautū with his Polynesian digging stick which was called [Tūwhakaroria. After arriving in the &quot;Uruao&quot; waka at Nelson, Rākaihautū divided his people into two groups. Rākaihautū led his group down the middle of the island, digging the South Island freshwater lakes. His son, Rakihouia, led the other group down the east coast of the South Island.

Ngāi Tahu visited Lake Ōhau as part of their seasonal food gathering patterns. It was well known for eels and weka. These were gathered and preserved for the upcoming winter months.

== Population ==

Lake Ōhau is probably one of the most unpopulated lakes in New Zealand. The Lake Ōhau Alpine Village has 140 sections and around 30 houses, of which the majority are holiday homes. The Village population was increasing, before the 4 October 2020 wildfire destroyed 48 houses in the Village. Visitors are often astounded by the peace and quiet around Lake Ōhau. Despite this, Lake Ōhau has benefited from tourism and visitors come all year round to visit Lake Ōhau.

== Stargazing ==
Lake Ōhau with its clear unpolluted skies and small population is known for the quality of the stargazing. In 2012, a 4300 square kilometre area was declared the Aoraki Mackenzie Dark Sky Reserve, the boundary of which follows the eastern shore of Lake Ōhau. This is one of only eight in the world.

== Farming ==
Farming has been the main economic activity around Lake Ōhau since the late 1800s. Several large high country stations existing in the immediate vicinity. Eileen McMillan wrote a 508 page book entitled &quot;Frugal Country and Hard on the Boots&quot; that covers the history of Lake Ōhau including farming in the region. In 1857 the land south and east of Lake Ōhau, Benmore Station, was leased to brothers George and Edmund Hodgkinson and Ronald McMurdo. In the 1870s, the Benmore Station comprised 101 500 hectares and 65 000 sheep.

In 1859 land at the head of the lake was leased and this high country station was known as the Lake Ohau Station. These huge high country stations were eventually broken up (around 1916) into smaller holdings as the population was unhappy about a small number of people owning the majority of the land. Sheep and beef farming continues to the present around Lake Ōhau.

== Skiing ==
Ōhau Ski Field is located on the western shore of the lake and is a 20 minute drive up a 9.6 km well-formed access road from the Lake Ohau Lodge. It is well known for its consistent snow, variety of runs and friendly atmosphere. The skifield was established in 1953 on Mount Sutton. As of 2020, it has a double chairlift, a platter and a snow mat.

The 2-seater chairlift reaches 1825 metres above sea level and from there, many intrepid skiers walk the remaining 100 vertical metres to the ridge to enjoy the views of the Southern Alps before skiing back down. Ōhau Ski Field has significant snow making capability.

The Glen Mary Ski Club was created in 1958 and a single room building was built on land between Freehold Creek and Parson’s Creek on the shores of Lake Ōhau. The club buildings have expanded over the years to include a 24 bed bunkhouse and a sauna.

== Fishing ==
Lake Ōhau is well known for its brown trout and rainbow trout fishing. It is also possible to catch some small landlocked sockeye salmon. Trolling from a boat, spinning from the shore and fly fishing are all popular methods of fishing at Lake Ōhau. Fishing in the Dobson and Hopkins rivers which flow into Lake Ōhau are well known spots for catching trout. There is good access to the lakeshore via the gravel road which runs around the almost all of the eastern and western shorelines. There is good access to launch a boat from many spots around the lake. The large weed-beds at the southern end of Lake Ōhau are easily fished with bait such as shrimp and prawn. The Hopkins River mouth provides good fishing however very loose shingle can make wading potentially dangerous. Large floods in this lake following heavy rain occur at regular intervals. On these occasions, Lake Ōhau can be dirty and unfishable for several weeks.

== Mountain biking ==
Lake Ōhau is on the route of the Alps to Ocean Cycle Trail, which has been constructed in the years after approval in 2010.

Stage 3 of the Alps 2 Ocean runs from Twizel to Lake Ōhau Lodge. This 38 km section takes riders along the canal roads to the edge of Lake Ōhau. It then turns into an off-road trail which runs along the lake up to Lake Ōhau Lodge. This section is of an easy skill level, with little traffic.

Stage 4 of the Alps 2 Ocean starts at the Lake Ōhau Lodge. The 45 km section traverses the lower slopes of the Ohau Range past Freehold Creek and climbs to the highest point of the Alps 2 Ocean, 900 metres above sea level, before a long descent with some rough and loose sections, finally arriving at a historic woolshed at the top of Quailburn Road. From here, mountain bikers ride most of the remaining stage on quiet country roads before arriving at Omarama.

== Lake Middleton ==

Next to Lake Ōhau is the much smaller Lake Middleton. It has a shoreline of just under two kilometres, with a surface area of approximately 24 hectares. It is a popular spot in summer for camping, boating and fishing. The lake is 523 metres above sea level.

Bookings are not required for the campsite. Access is available for motor homes and cars. Lake access is available for boats. There is a desire to provide a walking track around Lake Middleton but progress has been slow.

The northern end of the lake is roped off with a buoy line to mark an area for swimming. In 2019, 83% of the water samples met the swimming water quality standard. However the northern end of the lake is filling in with sediment and weed on the lake floor up to one metre deep in some places. The swimming area is now considered unsuitable for swimming

The many indigenous wildlife species at Lake Middleton include four fish, 27 birds, 26 plants (aquatic and terrestrial), 14 invertebrates (aquatic), and lizards present.

== Tramping around Lake Ōhau ==
The many options for tramping around Lake Ōhau range from short walks such as the Freehold Creek Track (6 km, 2–3 hours), to longer over night trips up the Hopkins and Huxley Valleys. Several back country huts in the Hopkins Valley are worth a visit, including Monument Hut, Red Hut, Elcho Hut and Erceg Hut.

The Huxley Valley, which branches off the Hopkins Valley, is home to several huts including Huxley Forks Hut. The Brodrick Hut can be accessed from the north branch of the Huxley river. From Brodrick Hut it is possible to climb over Brodrick Pass (1630 metres above sea level) and descend into the Landsborough Valley. The climb from Brodrick Hut to the pass is 600 vertical metres and on a well marked track. It is also possible to traverse from Brodrick Pass along the Main Divide in order to climb Mount McKenzie (2156 metres above sea level). This provides views of the Mt Hooker, Mt Dechen, Mt Strachan and Mt Cook.

Both the North Temple and South Temple Tracks are shorter day walks, accessible from the head of Lake Ōhau. The two tracks can be linked by the impressive Gunsight Pass. The South Temple Hut provides accommodation for weekend trampers. Scenic Views are possible from the Temple Valley Circuit track.

The Dasler Pinnacles (2315 metres above sea level) is a moderate to advanced two day tramp that can be accessed from the top of Lake Ōhau. Trampers have to march up the Hopkins river valley past Monument Hut and Red Hut to a short but steep climb to Dasler Bivvy. This small bivvy has two bunks in it. The Dasler Bivvy does not have good views of the valley but these can be accessed by climbing a further 15 minutes up through subalpine scrub. The Dasler Pinnacles (located to the north of Mount Glenmary) takes six to ten hours to the top and back from Dasler Bivvy. The climb requires good weather, a degree of skill to scramble over the rocks and a head for heights.

Te Araroa winds its way past Lake Ōhau. The Lake Tekapo to Lake Ōhau section is an easy but long 87 kilometres taking an average of two to three days walk, The East Ahuriri stage (from Glen Mary Ski Club on Lake Ōhau road and ending at Birchwood Road Carpark in the Ahuriri Valley) is a 26.5 kilometre stage that takes on average one to two days walking. It climbs Freehold Creek, passes the beautiful Dumb-bell Lake and then follows the East Ahuriri River.

== Ben Ohau ==
Ben Ohau is one of the more photographed mountains in New Zealand and sits of the edge of Lake Ōhau. It is possible to climb Ben Ohau. It is a 4 hour walk that ascends over 800 metres vertical to the top of Ben Ohau (1500 metres above sea level). The start of the walk is located along the Glen Lyon road, approximately 23 kilometres from Twizel. There is a car park at the road end with a Department of Conservation marking where the track starts. The track itself is an old four wheel drive track. The summit overlooks Lake Ōhau, Lake Pukaki, Lake Benmore and Lake Ruataniwha as well as the surrounding mountains. Ben Ohau is also known by its Māori name Te Ruataniwha.

The legends of Ngāi Tahu tell of Te Ruataniwha, who was an ancestor on the Ārai-te-uru waka that capsized near Shag Point on the Otago coastline. After the waka capsized, many of the passengers went ashore to explore the land. Legend states that they needed to be back at the waka before daylight. Many did not make it, including Te Ruataniwha, and he was instead transformed into the mountain of Ben Ohau.

== Flora and fauna ==
Himalayan tahr are widespread in the Ben Ohau Range. The population of tahr on all South Island conservation land is estimated to have peaked at 35,000, and a DOC contractor managed to cull more than 1,000 tahr in the Ben Ohau Range alone over two days in July 2019. Tahr graze native tussocks and plants, especially in the Ben Ohau range. A DOC ecologist has said that tussocks around the Ben Ohau range that were once as high as have been reduced to ankle height by grazing tahr.

Chamois and red deer are also found in the mountains surrounding Lake Ōhau including the Maitland Valley and the Temple Valley. Other introduced species that are commonly seen around Lake Ōhau are the ubiquitous rabbits.

The beech forests around Lake Ōhau contain nationally and internationally significant mistletoe populations of scarlet mistletoe (&quot;Peraxilla colensoi&quot;), red mistletoe (&quot;Peraxilla tetrapetala&quot;) and yellow mistletoe (&quot;Alepis flavida&quot;). All three of these species are ranked as &#x27;Declining&#x27;. These parasitic plants flower in November/December. The Ōhau Conservation Trust is working to promote awareness of, and protect, the unique habitats and biodiversity of the Lake Ōhau area.

The tussock slopes of Ben Ohau Range host a myriad of wildlife including moths, butterflies, lizards, grasshoppers, spiders and beetles. Bush birds likely to be spotted in the forests include tomtit/ miromiro, fantail/pīwakawaka, bellbird/korimako, rifleman/ tītitipounamu and morepork/ruru koukou. Further up the Hopkins Valley are New Zealand falcon/ kārearea, kea and rock wren/pīwauwau.

The beech forests near Lake Ōhau are a mixture of mountain and silver beech.

Wilding Pines (&quot;Pinus Cortorta, Pinus sylvestris&quot;) are problematic on the foreshore of Lake Ōhau. &quot;Pinus&quot; &quot;contorta&quot; grow “probably five to 10 times faster” in the Mackenzie Country (and Lake Ōhau) than in their native North America. They can establish themselves at altitudes of up to 2000 metres. Where they have becomes established and converted tussock grasslands to wilding pine forests, 25% to 30% less water reaches streams and lakes.

The pines outcompete native trees and tussock land. Shelter plantings were established for protection against harsh winds in places such as the Lake Ōhau Lodge in the 1950s. Wilding pines that spread from these early plantings have become a problem in adjacent areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilding trees in Mackenzie/Waitaki&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Ōhau Conservation Trust is working to keep the Lake Ōhau landscape in its natural state and eradicate wilding pines.

== Lake Ōhau fire 2020 ==
A significant wildfire on Sunday 4 October 2020 destroyed 48 houses. The fire started in the vicinity of Freehold Creek and Parsons Creek and then moved in a south and west direction. It burnt through 5032 hectares (including 1900 hectares of Department of Conservation land) and destroyed many houses in the Lake Ohau Alpine Village. The spread of wilding pines, and high winds and a dry winter attributed to climate change set the scene for the fire. The Insurance Council of New Zealand processed around 200 claims totalling NZ$34.8 million, making it one of the most expensive fires in the country. Fire and Emergency NZ completed a report as to the causes of the fire in November 2021. They said that the fire was as a result of a &quot;a crossarm failure on a power pole that was part of a section of lines crossing conservation land approximately 2.5 kilometres north-west of Lake Ōhau village&quot;. Waitaki Network, who are responsible for the power lines, believe that Fire and Emergency NZ are incorrect in their conclusions.

== Flooding 2022 ==
In July 2022, Lake Ōhau was hit by an almost one in a 100 year storm which caused significant flooding. Access to the Lake Ōhau Alpine Village and Ōhau ski field was cut off when a bridge on the Lake Ōhau road was washed out. Despite the damage, power and telephone lines were still working.

<doc id="1089000" wikidata="Q2023014" url="?curid=1089000" title="List of football clubs in Bulgaria">
<text>This list of football teams in Bulgaria, contains football clubs that have recently been and/or still are members of the Bulgarian Football Union.

==Overview==
The list consists of sports clubs that in recent years have been members of the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU). For a club to be a member of the BFU it has to endeavour in practising and/or developing football on the territory of Bulgaria. Thus, for a club to be a member of the BFU it is sufficient for it to have an active football youth academy, without sustaining any football team to participate in the tournaments organised by the BFU. Nevertheless, most members of the union do form a football team and almost all of them have a representative team for the men&#x27;s football tournaments organised by the BFU.

===Names===
Some clubs in the list have undergone slight name changes for administrative or technical purposes but still have the same representative team. (For example &quot;Lokomotiv 1926 (Plovdiv)&quot; in the list throughout the years has been officially named &quot;NFC Lokomotiv (Plovdiv)&quot;, &quot;FC Lokomotiv Plovdiv 1936&quot;, &quot;PFC Lokomotiv 1926 Plovdiv&quot;, etc.) Thus, the official name of a football club may differ slightly from the one in the list.

===Membership and Participation===
For a football club to be a member of the Bulgarian Football Union it is sufficient to engage in activities developing the sport, but not actively participating in the tournaments organised by the governing body. Thus a club may not have a participating team in the men&#x27;s football leagues considered in the list but still be a member of the union. A club may have its membership revoked by the executive committee of the BFU if it has not practised and/or developed football in Bulgaria for more than two years.

In the list, teams marked as Does Not Participate in the &quot;Level&quot; tab, may only have a youth academy, or women&#x27;s or children&#x27;s teams, or have stopped engaging in football altogether since the last Assembly of the executive committee of the BFU. Also, there were 182 clubs with revoked memberships and 103 clubs accepted as members of the union on the Assembly that was held on 14 February 2014, but information on the teams is not readily available to the public from the Bulgarian Football Union or the Bulgarian Professional Football League. Still, some of the teams may have ended the life-cycle of their legal personality (the registered football club), yet reapplied for membership in the BFU under a different legal body (a newly formed club successor of the previous), causing re-licensing and slight change of name but continuation of the team.

===Levels===
The football clubs in the list are divided into five hierarchical categories which represent the five levels of the Bulgarian football pyramid with &quot;Level 1&quot; being the top league and &quot;Level 5&quot; being the bottom league in the system. The hierarchical format of the pyramid has promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels at the end of each cycle (season), allowing self-sustaining system of better playing teams joining the higher levels.

Throughout the years, the various levels have had different names, number of participants and structure. Generally, the top level has always been a single league, while the lower levels have consisted of a various number of divisions specified geographically and running simultaneously. For instance, up to and including season 2011-12 the second tier of Bulgarian football consisted of two leagues: &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; divisions of the Bulgarian B Professional Football Group; also, the third level continues to have four divisions (South-West, South-East, North-East, and North-West) that run in parallel.

Despite changes in the official names of the leagues the levels are commonly referred to as follows:

Level 1: A Group

Level 2: B Group

Level 3: V Group

Level 4: A Oblast Group

Level 5: B Oblast Group
As of season 2013-14 the official names and structure of the five levels of Bulgarian football are:
;Level 1 - A Professional Football Group
:A PFG has one division of 14 clubs in it

;Level 2 - B Professional Football Group
:B PFG has one division of 14 clubs in it

;Level 3 - V Amateur Football Group
:V AFG has four divisions - North-East with 16 clubs, North-West with 16 clubs, South-West with 16 clubs, South-East with 18 clubs

;Level 4 - A Oblast Football Groups
:There are forty-five (45) divisions from the different districts in Bulgaria that run in parallel, forming 45 A OFGs. The number of teams varies by division.

;Level 5 - B Oblast Football Groups
:There are seventeen (17) divisions from the different districts in Bulgaria running simultaneously throughout the season. A various number of teams comprises each of the 17 B OFGs

While there is an abundance of Level 4 regional groups, there is a considerably smaller number of Level 5 divisions. This is a result of the uneven number of teams in the various oblasts of the country. For example, While the Burgas Oblast can sustain four Level 5 OFGs that are funneled into one Level 4 OFG, clubs from Smolyan and Lovech are enough to form only one division at one level so these oblasts have no Level 5 OFGs. Still, some of the &quot;provinces&quot; such as Blagoevgrad have five Level 4 divisions, but no Level 5 oblast groups.

===Regions===
The list includes a categorisation of teams by region of the country. The most reliable geographical categorisation of football clubs in Bulgaria has been the division of the clubs into four regions - those of V Group: North-West, North-East, South-East, and South-West, since it has been the sole constant division since the creation of the football pyramid in 1953.

The regions&#x27; borders are the administrative borders of the state&#x27;s &quot;provinces&quot; (oblasts) that constitute the regions.

:For the North-West region the included oblasts are: Vidin Province, Montana Province, Vratsa Province, Lovech Province, Pleven Province, Gabrovo Province, and Veliko Tarnovo Province.
:: Veliko Tarnovo is the administrative center of the North-West zone for V Group.

:For the North-East region the included oblasts are: Razgrad Province, Ruse Province, Targovishte Province, Silistra Province, Shumen Province, Dobrich Province, and Varna Province.
:: Varna is the administrative center of the North-East zone for V Group.

:For the South-East region the included oblasts are: Burgas Province, Yambol Province, Sliven Province, Stara Zagora Province, Haskovo Province, Kardzhali Province, Smolyan Province, and Plovdiv Province.
:: Plovdiv is the administrative center of the South-East zone for V Group.

:For the South-West region the included oblasts are: Pazardzhik Province, Blagoevgrad Province, Kyustendil Province, Pernik Province, Sofia Province and Sofia - city.
:: Sofia is the administrative center of the South-West zone for V Group.

<text>Mates of State are an American indie pop duo, active since 1997. The group is the husband-and-wife team of Kori Gardner (born June 16, 1974) (vocals, organ, synthesizer, piano, electric piano, and occasional guitar and drums) and Jason Hammel (born February 1, 1976) (vocals, drums, percussion, and occasional synthesizer).

As of 2015, the duo has released four EPs and seven full-length albums. Their most recent album, &quot;Mountaintops,&quot; was released on September 13, 2011.

==History==
Gardner and Hammel first met in Lawrence, Kansas, while both were involved in relationships with other people. Even though they exchanged e-mails regularly, they did not get together until three months later. They originally played together in a four-piece rock band called Vosotros, in which they both sang and played guitar. Shortly after the couple moved to California in 1998, Gardner began teaching, and Hammel applied to medical school. They both opted later to devote their time to making music and touring together instead and got married in 2001. Gardner and Hammel originally lived together in San Francisco, and in 2004 they moved to East Haven, Connecticut. In February 2007, they sold their house in East Haven and relocated to Stratford, Connecticut.

Gardner and Hammel have three daughters: Magnolia, born in 2004; June Elizabeth, born in 2008; and Phoebe Ann, born in 2017. For the band, touring became a family affair, their daughters joining them on the road. Gardner kept a &#x27;blog, &quot;Band on the Diaper Run,&quot; that appeared on Babble.com. In its entries, she recounted their experiences of life on the road and the unique circumstance of touring with two young children in tow.

The main instruments Mates of State used in their early recordings were drums and the electric organ. Both had started out playing the guitar, but they ultimately found they were experimenting more with the organ and drums in their practice space than with any other musical instruments. On later recordings, the band moved away from the organ-dominated sound and incorporated additional instrumentation, beginning with the EP &quot;All Day&quot; and continuing on &quot;Bring It Back,&quot; their fourth studio album. The organ wasn&#x27;t incorporated at all on their fifth album, &quot;Re-Arrange Us&quot;.

Mates of State songs are notable for their male/female vocal harmony, shifting rhythms, and quirky song structure – most tracks comprised distinct, almost disjointed movements. Both members tend to sing with great intensity, often in the upper ranges of their voices, and they often simultaneously sing different, complementary melodies and lyrics.

The band recorded one album on Omnibus Records before moving to Polyvinyl for their second and third full-length albums. In December 2005, the band signed with Barsuk Records and released two full-length albums and an EP of remixes on the label.

On October 11, 2004, the band held a contest for fans to create their own video for &quot;Goods (All In Your Head),&quot; the first track on their &quot;All Day&quot; EP. The winning entry, directed by Jonathan Yi and Sam Goetz, became the official video for the song and was aired on MTV on June 12, 2005. It became available for download in the Media section of the band&#x27;s official site.

The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Re-Arrange Us,&quot; was released on May 20, 2008. For their tour in support of the album, Mates of State became a quartet by adding Lewis and Anton Patzner of Judgement Day as multi-instrumentalists to complement the duo&#x27;s sound on select songs.

On June 15, 2010, Mates of State released their sixth studio album, &quot;Crushes (The Covers Mixtape),&quot; which consisted entirely of their cover versions of songs previously recorded by other musical artists, including &quot;Long Way Home&quot; by Tom Waits and &quot;Son Et Lumiere&quot; by The Mars Volta. Music videos were shot for two of the songs: Nick Cave&#x27;s &quot;Love Letter&quot; and Daniel Johnston&#x27;s &quot;True Love Will Find You in the End.&quot; The former was directed by Daniel Garcia and the latter was produced in conjunction with ABC News for its indie rock program, &quot;Amplified.&quot;

The band&#x27;s most recent full-length album, &quot;Mountaintops,&quot; was released on September 13, 2011. It also came out on Barsuk, the same independent label that released two of the band&#x27;s previous records, &quot;Bring It Back&quot; and &quot;Re-Arrange Us.&quot; It consisted entirely of new original material.

==Tours and performances==
Mates of State have performed all over the globe; in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia.

In the summer of 2001, they played shows with Superdrag and Beulah and, later in the year, opened for The Anniversary during the release tour for their album &quot;Your Majesty.&quot;

In 2003, Mates of State toured with Palomar.

In 2005, Mates of State toured with Jimmy Eat World and Taking Back Sunday, and performed at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas.

In 2006, Mates of State toured with Spoon and Death Cab for Cutie. Mates of State also provided support (alongside Au Revoir Simone) for We Are Scientists on their tour of the UK in November 2006.

During February and March 2007, Mates of State toured as the house band for WBEZ Chicago&#x27;s &quot;This American Life,&quot; hosted by Ira Glass. Tour locations included New York, Boston, Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Recordings of some of the band&#x27;s performances during this tour were included in a 2008 episode titled &quot;What I Learned from Television.&quot; On Earth Day in 2007, Mates of State headlined the Concert for a Green Earth in Westport, Connecticut.

In 2008, the team appeared again at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, in addition to performing at Lollapalooza in Chicago, the All Points West Music &amp; Arts Festival in Jersey City, and the Pemberton Music Festival in Pemberton, BC. In 2009, they played at Diversafest in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the Voodoo Fest in New Orleans on Halloween weekend.

In 2010, they appeared on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; in Rochester, New York.

Beginning in 2010, the band toured with backing musicians Kenji Shinagawa on guitar and John Panos on trumpet, both graduates of the University of Miami.

On February 16, 2012, the band began a 9-day tour of the East Coast at Union Transfer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

On June 11, 2013, they joined The Postal Service&#x27;s &quot;Give Up&quot; ten-year reunion tour at the Air Canada Theater in Toronto. The tour had stops in Boston, at the sold out Barclay&#x27;s Center in Brooklyn and shows in Minnesota and Kansas City. Mates of State opened The Postal Service&#x27;s last show of the tour on August 4, 2013 at the Metro in Chicago. It was also the official Lollapalooza closing party and the last time The Postal Service would tour for a decade.

They performed two songs in conjunction with BYUtv&#x27;s Studio C: &quot;Dealbreaker&quot; in October 2013 and &quot;Kill the Whales&quot; in May 2014.

<doc id="1089005" wikidata="Q7080625" url="?curid=1089005" title="Ōhau (skifield)">
<text>Ōhau is a small commercial skifield in the foothills of New Zealand&#x27;s Southern Alps, near the boundary between the Otago and Canterbury regions, and close to the western shore of the lake of the same name. The skifield was originally developed by the Mount Cook and Southern Lakes Tourist Co. The field&#x27;s service town, Lake Ohau Alpine Village, is located on the shore of the lake to the south of the skifield.

== Details ==
In 2004, a new two seater chairlift was installed on the slopes. This chairlift opened up the snowfield a lot more and increased the lift-accessible terrain. The next year, the longest snowmat in New Zealand was installed in place of the ropetow. The skifield now has 3 lifts (1 chairlift, 1 platter lift and 1 snowmat).

The base altitude is 1400 m and the highest altitude is 1825 m. The access road is an unsealed alpine road but is usually kept in good condition with buses leaving from the lodge daily.

Historically, the season has run from mid-July to early October. In 2008, a new 23-cannon, fully automated snowmaking system was installed, allowing the skifield to open earlier, capturing lucrative July school holiday business.

== Expansion plans ==
In March 2012 it was announced that an ex-Treble Cone 2 seater chair lift had been purchased. This was to be installed over the following summer in time for the 2013 season, giving visitors a secondary access to the peak. This installation did not occur, and in June 2013 it was announced this chair lift had been traded for the ex-Cardrona &quot;La Franchie&quot; 2 seater chair lift to be installed depending on the success of the 2013 winter season. This new chair lift has a claimed increased capacity of 1200 skiers and boarders per hour on a 4.5 minute trip. In March 2014 it was noted, &quot;unfortunately we cannot afford to put in the chairlift for 2014 but hopefully if the business continues to trend upwards we can put it in for 2015!&quot;

== Scenery ==
Ōhau has some of the most spectacular mountain views in New Zealand. From the summit of the skifield a view of the Southern Alps can be seen. From the skifield runs, Lake Ōhau and the Mackenzie Basin can be seen spread out below in the valley floor. There are good views across the lake to Ben Ohau.

<text>A koniscope (or coniscope) is a scientific instrument to detect and measure content of dust particles in the atmosphere. A koniscope is also called dust counter, or Aitken dust counter, named after John Aitken who invented the first koniscope.

The koniscope is made by connecting a pump to a test tube that is walled with moist paper. The tube is held towards a light source and the pump is briefly activated. Dust particles will cling to the paper, producing a visible change in color.

<text>Corvera de Asturias (Asturian: &quot;Corvera&quot;) is a municipality in the principality of Asturias in northern Spain. It shares a boundary to the north with Avilés and Gozón; to the east with Carreño and Gijón; to the south with Llanera and Illas and to the west with Castrillón. Its capital, Nubledo, has a population of more than 300 residents.

Corvera is the most eastern of the four counties forming the Great County of Aviles. It is situated in the northern-central area of the Principality of Asturias. It is in size and has a population of over 16,000 residents, mainly concentrated in the villages of Las Vegas and Los Campos. The main roads to get there are AS-19, AS-17 and A-8. The A-8 proceeds to Tabaza (Carreño) and the shopping centre Parque Astur.

==History==

The history of Corvera is linked to the history of Avilés, being a natural extension of it proceeding inland.

Several prehistorical settlements have been found in the county. The most interesting are those belonging to the Astures. They left their traces in two &quot;castros&quot; (fortified villages) that have not been excavated yet: Pico Castiello in Molleda and Castiellu in Camina, Solís. These &quot;castros&quot; were most probably used by the Romans, and we have some traces of their presence there, some of them so important as the Estela Antropomorfa de Molleda (human-shaped figure), nowadays can be seen in the Archaeological Museum of Asturias.In the 10th century the villages of the county of Aviles became together to form an only geographical entity known as the &quot;Alfoz de Gauzzone&quot;; but it is not until the year 1120 that we find the first written references to the county of Corvera in the Liber Testamentorum. In the 15th century, Corvera already appears as a county, independent of Aviles.

In the 19th century, the landscape of the area was mainly agricultural. The population centres were villages with a certain prestige in which we can still see palaces and Indiano houses. In the mid 20th century the iron and steel industry starts functioning in Avilés and the old rural centres begin to shelter the thousands of immigrants working for ENSIDESA (current Arcelor modifying the aspect of the county, due to the building of new districts near the factories, such as Tresona and Les Vegues.

<doc id="1089019" wikidata="Q7331078" url="?curid=1089019" title="Lake Mahinerangi">
<text>Lake Mahinerangi is a lake in Otago formed when a dam was built on the Waipori River for hydroelectric generation. The lake is to the west of Dunedin in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Construction of the dam started in 1903 and since 1907, power has been produced.

==Naming==
The lake was named for Dorothy Kathleen Mahinerangi Burnett. She was the daughter of William Burnett, who was mayor of Dunedin in 1911 and 1912. The lake has a maximum length of , and lies on the western side of Maungatua, above and to the west of the Berwick Forest. It is surrounded by farmland, tussock grasslands, and plantation forest.

==Hydro-electric development==

The tributaries of the Waipori River are in the Lammerlaw Range. The river descends gradually until the Waipori Gorge, where it suddenly drops in approximately . This makes the gorge an ideal site for a hydro-electric scheme. The first proposals to develop the river for hydro-electric generation were prepared in 1900, for powering gold mining dredges. However, the plans were eventually altered to supply power to Dunedin city and surrounding districts. Construction began in early 1903.

The generating plant commenced operation on 27 April 1907. Electricity was transmitted to Halfway Bush substation in Dunedin via two 33 kV lines. However, there was no storage built into the original scheme, and in the first year of operation, low flows in the river led to constraints on the generating capacity. Between 1907 and 1913, some storage lakes were created on tributaries, including an early concrete arch dam on Pioneer Creek.

There was opposition from gold mining interests that blocked the development of storage capacity on the Waipori River itself, because Waipori Flat was still being actively mined. In 1920, the Dunedin City Corporation Empowering Act was successfully pushed through Parliament, against opposition from mining interests, to enable the use of the Waipori River as a hydro-electric reservoir.

The first dam was built in 1923, and later raised, but ultimately had to be abandoned because of inadequate foundations. A second Empowering Act of 1924 enabled another dam to be built further downstream, with work beginning in 1927, and completing in 1931. Lake Mahinerangi was formed by this new high dam, and an additional powerhouse of capacity was commissioned. The new lake submerged the mining township of Waipori.

The Mahinerangi Dam was completed to its final height of in 1946. By 1955, two more generating stations had been built downstream from the original powerhouse. There have been further replacements and additions to generating capacity between the 1960s and 1980s.

The Waipori hydro-electric scheme includes a network of four dams and power stations and produces a maximum output of .

==Arms==
At the southern end, the lake has two major arms, called Loch Luella and Loch Loudon.

==Fishing==
The lake is well stocked with brown trout and some perch. The elevation is nearly and the lake can be very windswept and cold, which makes the fishery best suited to the warmer months.

==Wind farm==
Trustpower&#x27;s Mahinerangi Wind Farm is located to the north of the lake.

<text>Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and most downstream of the three man-made lakes on the Waitaki River, and forms part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It lies downstream of lakes Aviemore and Benmore on the Waitaki River, close to the town of Kurow. It is part of the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago regions (although the official border has been moved southward to include the entire lake, as well as the entire northwest portion of the Waitaki District within the Canterbury Region.

The lake was created by the Waitaki Dam, a 36m high concrete gravity dam built between 1928 and 1934. Waitaki Dam was the first hydroelectric dam built on the Waitaki River. The Waitaki power station has a total installed capacity of 105MW.

Waitaki was the last dam built in New Zealand with excavation done with pick and shovel, not heavy machinery. The power station was to be upgraded by Meridian Energy between 2011 and 2016 at a projected cost of $NZ 60 – 80 million.

<text>Feliks Paweł Jarocki (Pacanów, 14 January 1790 – 25 March 1865, Warsaw) was a Polish zoologist and entomologist.

==Life==
Jarocki was a Doctor of Liberal Arts and Philosophy. He organized and managed the Zoological Cabinet of the Royal University of Warsaw from 1819 to 1862. The collection was based on that of Baron Sylwiusz Minckwitz, which included over 20,000 specimens. Jarocki built up this collection through purchases and scientific expeditions to eastern Poland. He also acquired many important books for the zoological library. When he retired the zoological collection included 65,690 specimens, and the library had 2,000 volumes. He was succeeded as curator by Władysław Taczanowski.

Jarocki was the author of &quot;Zoologia czyli zwierzętopismo ogólne podług naynowszego systemu ułożone&quot; (1821).

In September 1828 he accompanied the 18-year-old Chopin to Berlin.

<text>Lake Aviemore or Mahi Tikumu is a man-made lake in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme. Immediately upstream is Lake Benmore and downstream Lake Waitaki. Aviemore lies on both sides of the border between the Waimate and Waitaki districts.

It is part of the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago regions, although, officially, the border has been moved southward to include the lake, as well as the entire northwestern portion of the Waitaki District in the Canterbury Region. The Otematata settlement situated on State Highway 83 is just west of the lake, and was built in 1958 as a base for the construction of the Aviemore and Benmore Dams. Closer to the lake the old village Wharekuri which encompasses Aviemore was populous in the 1860s.

The Aviemore Dam, completed in 1968, is the newest of the three dams on the Waitaki river. It is made out of both earth and concrete.

By continuing the sinuous course of the river after the lake, one encounters Parsons Rock, named after Reverend J.C. Andrew (&quot;The Parson&quot;) who usually gave Christmas sermon there. A story goes to say that stolen gold taken from the Wharekuri Hotel was hidden near Parsons Rock. The suspects were to be apprehended but no money was ever found by the authorities in the hiding place.

In both Lake Aviemore and Benmore, one can fish salmon and trout year round except in September. Two main events are held on Lake Aviemore, there is the Labour weekend &quot;Aviemore Classic Trailer yacht race&quot; and the &quot;Windsurfing Championships&quot; in January.

<text>Robin Hood is a 1922 silent adventure film starring Douglas Fairbanks and Wallace Beery. It was the first motion picture ever to have a Hollywood premiere, held at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre on October 18, 1922. The movie&#x27;s full title, under which it was copyrighted, is Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood. It was one of the most expensive films of the 1920s, with a budget estimated at one million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). The film was a smash hit and generally received favorable reviews.

==Plot==

The opening has the dashing Earl of Huntingdon besting his bitter enemy, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, in a joust. Huntingdon then joins King Richard the Lion-Hearted, who is going off to fight in the Crusades and has left his brother, Prince John, as regent. The prince soon emerges as a cruel, treacherous tyrant. Goaded on by Sir Guy, he usurps Richard&#x27;s throne. When Huntingdon receives a message from Lady Marian Fitzwalter, his love interest, telling him of all that has transpired, he requests permission to return to England. King Richard assumes that the Earl has turned coward and denies him permission. The Earl seeks to leave in spite of this, but is ambushed by Sir Guy and imprisoned as a deserter. Upon escaping from his confines, he returns to England, endangering his life and honor, to oppose Prince John and restore King Richard&#x27;s throne. He finds his friends and himself outlawed and Marian apparently dead.

Huntingdon returns to Nottingham and adopts the name of Robin Hood, acrobatic champion of the oppressed. Leading a band that steals from the rich to give to the poor, including Friar Tuck, Little John, Will Scarlet, and Allan-a-Dale, he labors to set things right through swashbuckling feats and makes life miserable for Prince John and his cohort, the high sheriff of Nottingham. After rescuing Marian from Prince John&#x27;s prison and defeating Sir Guy in a final conflict, Robin is captured. The timely reappearance of King Richard returns him to Marian and foils the efforts of Prince John.

==Cast==
* Douglas Fairbanks as Earl of Huntingdon/Robin Hood (Fairbanks&#x27;s custom was to place his name last.)
* Wallace Beery as King Richard the Lion-Hearted
* Sam De Grasse as Prince John
* Enid Bennett as Lady Marian Fitzwalter
* Paul Dickey as Sir Guy of Gisbourne
* William Lowery as The High Sheriff of Nottingham
* Willard Louis as Friar Tuck
* Alan Hale as The Squire/Little John
* Bud Geary as Will Scarlet
* Lloyd Talman as Allan-a-Dale
* Billie Bennett as Servant to Lady Marian

Wallace Beery played King Richard the Lion-Hearted again the following year in a sequel called &quot;Richard the Lion-Hearted&quot;.

Alan Hale, Sr., made such an impression as Little John in this film that he reprised the role 16 years later in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938) opposite Errol Flynn, then played the character again in &quot;Rogues of Sherwood Forest&quot; in 1950, 28 years after his initial performance in the original Fairbanks film.

==Production==

A huge castle set and an entire 12th-century village of Nottingham were constructed at the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio in Hollywood. Some sets were designed by architect Lloyd Wright. Director Allan Dwan later recalled that Fairbanks was so overwhelmed by the scale of the sets that he considered cancelling production at one point. The castle was largely built of wood, wire, and plaster. The exceptions were the concrete floor and the (wood-covered) steel drawbridge.

The story was adapted for the screen by Fairbanks (as &quot;Elton Thomas&quot;), Kenneth Davenport, Edward Knoblock, Allan Dwan, and Lotta Woods, and was produced by Fairbanks for his own production company, Douglas Fairbanks Pictures Corporation, and distributed by United Artists, a company owned by Fairbanks, his wife Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith. This swashbuckling adventure was based on the legendary tale of the medieval hero, Robin Hood, and was the first production to present many of the elements of the legend that became familiar to movie audiences in later versions, although an earlier treatment had been filmed a decade before in the woods around Fort Lee, New Jersey, featuring even more flamboyant costumes than the Fairbanks version.

==Score==
At its premiere, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was accompanied by an orchestral score especially commissioned by Fairbanks and composed by Victor Schertzinger. That score has also been adapted and conducted live by U.S. composer Gillian Anderson. Though the film has received many live and recorded scores since its first release, perhaps the two most significant are further orchestral scores written in 2007 by American composer and conductor John Scott, and in 2016 by eminent British silent film musician Neil Brand.

==Reception==

&quot;Robin Hood&quot; generally received favorable reviews. It received an aggregate score of 100% and an average rating of 8.4/10 from Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews. Combustible Celluloid&#x27;s Jeffrey M. Anderson rated the movie 4 stars out of 4, concluding &quot;Director Allan Dwan had worked with Fairbanks on several two-reelers, and would go on to direct his last silent film, &quot;The Iron Mask&quot; (1929). Dwan would continue working, making &quot;B&quot; pictures up until the 1960s, and finishing up with something like 500 films on his resume before he died. But &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is his masterpiece.&quot;.

Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance evaluated the film in 2008 as follows: &quot;&quot;Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood&quot; is the most important legacy of the rich life and career of Douglas Fairbanks. The towering sets are long gone, and the characters have been reimagined and reinterpreted, but the foundation the film was built upon—and the culture it created—exists to this day...The creation of &quot;Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood&quot; consumed nearly a year of his life, and the experience established the matrix for all of his subsequent silent film productions. Indeed, it was the first of his productions to be fully realized in every respect.&quot;

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, usually in a leading truck, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles and no trailing wheels. This arrangement is commonly called a Mogul.
==Overview==
In the United States and Europe, the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement was principally used on tender locomotives. This type of locomotive was widely built in the United States from the early 1860s to the 1920s.

Although examples were built as early as 1852–53 by two Philadelphia manufacturers, Baldwin Locomotive Works and Norris Locomotive Works, these first examples had their leading axles mounted directly and rigidly on the frame of the locomotive rather than on a separate truck or bogie. On these early 2-6-0 locomotives, the leading axle was merely used to distribute the weight of the locomotive over a larger number of wheels. It was therefore essentially an 0-8-0 with an unpowered leading axle and the leading wheels did not serve the same purpose as, for example, the leading trucks of the 4-4-0 American or 4-6-0 Ten-Wheeler types which, at the time, had been in use for at least a decade.

The first American 2-6-0 with a rigidly mounted leading axle was the &quot;Pawnee&quot;, built for heavy freight service on the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Rail Road. In total, about thirty locomotives of this type were built for various American railroads. While they were generally successful in slow, heavy freight service, the railroads that used these first 2-6-0 locomotives didn&#x27;t see any great advantages in them over the 0-6-0 or 0-8-0 designs of the time. The railroads noted their increased pulling power, but also found that their rather rigid suspension made them more prone to derailments than the 4-4-0 locomotives of the day. Many railroad mechanics attributed these derailments to having too little weight on the leading truck.

The first true 2-6-0s were built in the early 1860s, the first few being built in 1860 for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The new design required the use of a single-axle swiveling truck. Such a truck was first patented in the United Kingdom by Levi Bissell in May 1857.

In 1864, William S. Hudson, then the superintendent of Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, patented an equalized leading truck that was able to move independently of the driving axles. This equalized suspension worked much better over the uneven tracks of the day. The first locomotive built with such a leading truck was likely completed in 1865 for the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company as their number 39.

The locomotive class name likely derives from a locomotive named &quot;Mogul&quot;, built by Taunton Locomotive Manufacturing Company in 1866 for the Central Railroad of New Jersey. However, it has also been suggested that it derived from the British 2-6-0 engine of that name, the prototype of its class, built by Neilson and Company for the Great Eastern Railway in 1879.

==Usage==

===Australia===
Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company provided large numbers of standard design narrow gauge Mogul locomotives to several Australian Railways. Users of the Mogul type include the South Australian Railways with its Y class, the Tasmanian Government Railways with its C class, the Western Australian Government Railways with its G class (in a configuration as well) and numerous private users. The SAR also purchased 8 examples of the type built by Baldwin which became the X class. The New South Wales Government Railways had a number of mogul types starting from the 1880s, forming the Z21, Z22, Z24, Z25 and Z27 classes.

===Belgian Congo===
Twenty locomotives were built by &quot;Les Ateliers de Tubize&quot; locomotive works in Belgium for the &quot;CF du Congo Superieur aux Grands Lacs Africains&quot; (CFL) between 1913 and 1924. The first eight, numbered 27 to 34, were built in 1913, followed by six more in 1921, numbered 35 to 40. Six more of a slightly larger version followed in 1924, numbered 41 to 46. They had cylinders and diameter driving wheels, with the smaller versions having a working order mass of and the larger versions . Most of the CFL was regauged to gauge in 1955, as were all of the serving Moguls. Most of them still survived in 1973.

===Canada===
A large number of 2-6-0 locomotives were used in Canada, where they were considered more usable in restricted spaces, being shorter than the more common 4-6-0 Ten-Wheelers. Canadian National (CN) had several. One of them, the CN no. 89, an E-10-a class locomotive built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1910, has been owned and operated since 1972 by the Strasburg Rail Road in Pennsylvania in the US, in conjunction with the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. Another no. 81 has since its retirement been on public display outdoors in &quot; Palmerston Lions Heritage Park &quot; just south of Main Street in Palmerston, Ontario, Canada.

A well-preserved version, the White Pass and Yukon Route No. 51, can be found at the MacBride Museum of Yukon History in Whitehorse, Yukon.

===Finland===

Finland&#x27;s 2-6-0 locomotives were the Classes Sk1, Sk2, Sk3, Sk4, Sk5 and Sk6.

Finnish Steam Locomotive Class Sk1s were built from 1885 by Swiss Locomotive &amp; Machine Works. They carried numbers 117 to 131, 134 to 149, 152 to 172 and 183 to 190. These locomotives were nicknamed &quot;Little Brown&quot;.

Class Sk2 locomotives were numbered 196 to 213, 314 to 321 and 360 to 372. They were built by Tampella. No. 315 is preserved at Tampere in Tampella.

Finnish Steam Locomotive Class Sk3s were built from 1903 by &quot;Tammerfors Linne &amp; Jern Manufakt. A.B.&quot; They were numbered 173 to 177, 191 to 195, 214 to 221, 334 to 359, 373 to 406 and 427 to 436. These locomotives were nicknamed &quot;Grandmothers&quot;.

===Indonesia===

The State Railway Company of the Dutch East Indies (&quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot;, SS) in Indonesia operated 83 units of tank locomotives of the C12 series, built by Sächsische Maschinenfabrik of Chemnitz, Germany in 1896. They were wood-burning locomotives which consumed two cubic metres of wood and of water for 4½ hours of steam production.

Of these locomotives, 43 survived the invasion by Japan during the Second World War and were still being operated following independence from the Netherlands. They were based in Cepu in Indonesia and were used on the Cepu-Blora-Purwodadi-Semarang-Bojonegoro-Jatirogo route, now closed.

By the early 1980s, the survivors of the class were in poor condition. One example, C1218 no. 457, was revived in 2002 after twenty-five years, in Ambarawa motive power depot. By mid-2006 it was operational, and since 2009 it was moved to Surakarta, Central Java to haul a chartered steam train across the main street of the heart of Surakarta, named &quot;Jaladara&quot;.

===Ireland===

Several locomotive classes found usage on Ireland&#x27;s railways, mainly with freight trains. The first of these would be the Great Southern and Western Railway Class 355, which were originally built by the North British Locomotive Company as an 0-6-0 type in 1903, but later rebuilt into 2-6-0s after problems occurred; they were soon supplemented with the similar Class 368. Some of these locomotives were converted to oil firing and one even for peat-burning.

Later classes of 2-6-0 include the Dublin and South Eastern Railway nos. 15 and 16 (with no. 15 being preserved), and the Great Southern Railways Classes 372 and 393, the latter of which were based on the British SECR N Class.

===Italy===
The Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane came to operate more than 500 locomotives of the Class 625 for mixed traffic and the Class 640 for light passenger trains. These locomotives, nicknamed &quot;Little Ladies&quot; (&quot;Signorine&quot;), were very successful and several were preserved after the end of regular steam services, with some still operational for heritage trains.

===New Zealand===
The Class J of the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) was its pioneering tender freight locomotive, introduced in 1877 for use in the re-gauged Canterbury region of the South Island. Built by the Avonside Engine Company and other locomotive works in England, they were shipped to New Zealand in kit form. They eventually served all over New Zealand&#x27;s fledgling rail network on both islands. In time, they were replaced on mainline running as larger power arrived. Many survived into the 1920s as yard shunters and some were converted to tank locomotives.

===South Africa===
====Cape gauge====
In 1876 and 1877, the Cape Government Railways (CGR) placed eighteen Mogul locomotives in freight service on the Cape Western system, built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company and the Avonside Engine Company. They were designated 1st Class when a classification system was adopted. By 1912, three of them survived to be considered obsolete by the South African Railways (SAR), designated Class 01 and renumbered by having the numeral 0 prefixed to their existing numbers. All were withdrawn from service by 1916.
Also in 1876, the CGR placed a pair of Stephenson&#x27;s Patent back-to-back Mogul type side-tank locomotives in service on the Cape Midland system, built by Kitson &amp; Company. They were later separated and rebuilt to saddle-tank locomotives for use as shunting engines. When a classification system was introduced, they were designated 1st Class.

In 1876 and 1877, the CGR placed eight Mogul tender locomotives in service on the Cape Midland system, also built by Kitson &amp; Company. They were all eventually rebuilt to saddle-tank locomotives for use as shunting engines. When a classification system was adopted, they were also designated 1st Class.
In 1877, Whythes &amp; Jackson Limited, contracted by the Natal government for the construction of the line from Durban to Pietermaritzburg, took delivery of two 2-6-0 tank locomotives from Kitson &amp; Company for use during construction. The locomotives were not numbered, but were appropriately named &quot;Durban&quot; and &quot;Pietermaritzburg&quot; after the two towns which were to be connected by the new railway. Upon completion of the construction contract at the end of 1880, the locomotives were taken over by the Natal Government Railways (NGR) and in 1893 they were sold to the Selati Railway.
In 1877 and 1878, seven Mogul tank locomotives were also delivered to the NGR by BP, built to the same design as the two contractor&#x27;s locomotives. Later classified as NGR Class K, they were the first locomotives to be ordered for use on the then newly laid Cape gauge Natal mainline into the interior. One was sold to the East Rand Proprietary Mines and two came into SAR stock in 1912, but remained unclassified as &quot;NGR 2-6-0T Beyer Peacock Sidetank&quot;. Although they were considered obsolete, they remained in service as late as 1931.
In 1879 and 1880, the CGR placed ten Moguls, built by Beyer, Peacock and Company, in freight service on the Cape Western system. While similar to the locomotives of 1876, their cylinders were mounted at a downward inclination towards the driving wheelset. They were also designated 1st Class when a classification system was adopted on the CGR.

In 1879, the NGR placed seven locomotives in service. They were subsequently modified to a wheel arrangement and were designated NGR Class G. In 1912, when fifteen of them were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and reclassified to Class C.

In 1891, the CGR placed two Baldwin-built 2-6-0 Mogul locomotives in freight service, the first American locomotives to enter service in South Africa. They were originally designated 5th Class, but the classification was later changed to 1st Class. One of them still survived in 1912 and was also designated Class 01 by the SAR. It was withdrawn from service in 1920.
In 1900, while the Second Boer War was still in progress, four 2-6-0T locomotives arrived in the Cape Colony, built by the Dickson Manufacturing Company in 1899. Since they bore cab side-plates inscribed &quot;SS-ZAR&quot; and were named &quot;J.S. Smit&quot;, &quot;J.J. Spier&quot;, &quot;L.S. Meyer&quot; and &quot;C. Birkenstock&quot;, they were intended for the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) in the &quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot; (ZAR). They were diverted to Indwe Collieries in the Cape Colony and when the CGR later took control of the colliery line, these locomotives were classified as part of the CGR 3rd Class. All four survived to come into SAR stock in 1912, when they were classified as Class O3. They were withdrawn by 1915.

Also in 1900, two Mogul saddle-tank locomotives entered shunting service at the Port Elizabeth Harbour, followed by one more in 1903.

In 1902, the Zululand Railway Company, contractors for the construction of the North Coast line from Verulam to the Tugela River, acquired two 2-6-0 tender locomotives as construction engines. Upon completion of the line in 1903, the locomotives were taken onto the roster of the Natal Government Railways and designated Class I.

Between 1902 and 1904, eleven Mogul saddle tank locomotives, built by Hunslet Engine Company, were delivered to the Table Bay Harbour Board. All were taken onto the Cape Government Railways roster in 1908 and came into SAR stock in 1912, but were considered obsolete and remained unclassified.

====Narrow gauge====

In 1902, the CGR placed three locomotives with a Mogul wheel arrangement in service on the Hopefield narrow gauge branch line that was being constructed from Kalbaskraal. They were built by Baldwin and were of a standard type that was being used on the narrow gauge railroads of Maine in the US. A fourth locomotive, identical to the first three, was ordered from the same manufacturer in 1911. In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered with an &quot;NG&quot; prefix to their running numbers. When a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were to be classified as Class NG7 but had already been withdrawn from service.

===Thailand===
The Royal State Railway of Siam (RSR(S)), predecessor to the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), had four classes of 2-6-0 type locomotives in its motive power fleet. Two of these locomotive classes were built for the standard gauge lines laid in to the north, one of them for the metre gauge lines laid to the south, joined by another one brought over by Japanese forces building the Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway, during the Second World War.
* The first class of 2-6-0s in Thailand were built by Krauss and Co. in batches of 3, 1, and 4, in 1898, 1900, and 1902 respectively, for the standard gauge lines to the north of the country. Their front bogie was a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie and these were the first steam locomotives in Thailand to be fitted with Walschaerts valve gear. However, these engines were fired on wood, and so, their steaming qualities were hampered since they were designed as coal burners rather than wood burners.
* The second class of 2-6-0s in Thailand were also built by Krauss in batches of 2 and 1 in 1901 and 1912 respectively, for the metre gauge lines to the south of the country. These resembled the standard gauge 2-6-0s Krauss supplied earlier to the standard gauge network of Thailand, also being fitted with the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. Another two were also built by Krauss but the Great War blocked the delivery of these locomotives, later finding work with the Imperial German Army and postwar, on a private railway. Later, these locomotives would be given a class designation, as their class C.
* The third class of 2-6-0s in Thailand were built by Hanomag (Hanover Locomotive Works) in batches of 1, 3, 7, and 2 in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910, repectively. The first of these locomtives were comissioned by the RSR as a response to the steaming issues that hampered the standard gauge Krauss 2-6-0s, resulting in a design based on the Prussian G 5 class locomotives, and were fitted with Allan straight link valve gear and an Adams radial axle for the front bogie.
* The fourth class of 2-6-0s in Thailand were 46 of the Japanese C56 class locomotives, brought over to run the Burma Railway. Initially, 90 of these locomotives were brought over for these purposes, but their numbers had been reduced to 46 by the war&#x27;s end.

The standard gauge Krauss locomotives would receive no gauge conversion with the standardisation of the Thai railways to metre gauge in 1930, and were all scrapped by late March in the same year.

The metre gauge Krauss locomotives had 4 remaining members left around 1938.

The standard gauge Hanomag locomotives, on the other hand, received gauge conversions upon metre gauge standardisation from 1924-28 when Makkasan works received necessary equipment to conduct rolling stock gauge conversion. These locomotives would run until the 1950s.

The C56s brought to Thailand would later be inherited by the State Railway of Thailand, and several of these would be preserved. Two Thai C56 locomotives have been repatriated to Japan: they are nos. C56 31—still with its Thai ABC coupler intact, and C56 44, respectively nos. 725 and 735 of the Thai railways.

Nos. 713 and 715 have been retained in working order for the annual &quot;son et lumière&quot; show at the River Kwai bridge.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, where locomotives are generally smaller than in the US, the was found to be a good wheel arrangement for mixed-traffic locomotives.

Circa 1870, one 2-6-0T engine was built for the Garstang and Knot-End Railway. The first unsuccessful examples were fifteen locomotives built to a design of William Adams for the Great Eastern Railway in 1878–79.

The Midland and South Western Junction Railway acquired two examples built to an Australian design by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1895 and 1897.

A long strike by workers throughout the British engineering industry in 1898/1899 led to a backlog of locomotive orders. This led leading British companies to place orders with American builders for standard light general-purpose locomotives adapted to British requirements. In 1899, the Midland Railway (MR), the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the Great Central Railway (GCR) all purchased examples from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in the US. The MR also bought ten from Schenectady Locomotive Works at the same time. In the United States, the 2-6-0 was already the common design for this sort of engine, and these imports were to be very influential in introducing the wheel arrangement to the United Kingdom.
At the time of the Grouping in 1923, 2-6-0 locomotives were already operated by the Great Western Railway (2600 and 4300 classes of 1900 and 1911 respectively), the Caledonian Railway (34 class, 1912), the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (K class, 1913), the Glasgow and South Western Railway (403 class, 1915), the GNR (H2, H3 and H4 classes, 1920), and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (N class, 1922).

Several of these designs continued to be built by the Big Four after 1923, and several new and successful designs were introduced so that the 2-6-0 became the principal type for medium-loaded mixed-traffic duties. Notable new designs included the London, Midland and Scottish Railway’s Hughes Crab (1926), the Southern Railway&#x27;s U class (1928), the Stanier Mogul (1934), the Ivatt Class 2 (1946), the Ivatt Class 4 (1947), the London and North Eastern Railway’s Class K4 (1937) and the Thompson/Peppercorn K1 class which were built in 1949–50 after the nationalisation of British Railways.

British Railways continued to build the Ivatt and Thompson/Peppercorn designs and then introduced three standard designs, based on the Ivatt classes. These were the Standard Class 2 in 1952, the Standard Class 4 in 1952 and the Standard Class 3 in 1954. 2-6-0 locomotives continued to be built until 1957 and the last ones were withdrawn from service in 1968.

===United States===
The first true with single-axle swivelling leading trucks were built in the United States in 1860 for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The New Jersey Locomotive and Machine Company built their first 2-6-0 in 1861, as the &quot;Passaic&quot; for the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The Erie Railroad followed in 1862 with the first large order of this locomotive type. In 1863, Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works built more for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company.

The Baltimore &amp; Ohio (B&amp;O) no. 600, a Mogul built at the B&amp;O&#x27;s Mount Clare Shops in 1875, won first prize the following year at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. It is preserved at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum, housed in the former Mount Clare shops in Baltimore.

Well over 11,000 Moguls were constructed in the United States by the time production had ended in 1910. Very few of these classic steam locomotives still exist, most of them having been scrapped as newer, faster and more powerful steam engines were developed in the twentieth century. The USRA standard designs of 1918 did not include a .

Five notable 2-6-0 locomotives are still in operation in the United States.
* Southern Pacific No. 1744 has spent more time out of service than it did under its own power in the preservation era. It is now being planned to operate on the Niles Canyon Railway in Sunol, California.
* Ex New Berlin &amp; Winfield Railroad No. 2, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1906, was rebuilt and is maintained by the Midwest Central Railroad.
* Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) No. 2 &quot;Lilly Belle&quot;, built in September 1928 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works as No. 76 (later No. 260) for the United Railways of Yucatán in Mexico, operates on the railroad circling the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida since 1 October 1971. Due to mechanical problems, this locomotive was shipped to the Strasburg Rail Road for an extensive overhaul in 2010. In late July 2016, it returned to the Magic Kingdom and resumed service on November 23, 2016.
* Canadian National 89 operates in excursion service on the Strasburg Rail Road.
* Everett Railroad 11 operates tourist trains on the Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania-based shortline.

Preserved non-operating examples include:
* The Southern Pacific No. 1785, located in Woodburn, Oregon.
* The Southern Pacific No. 1774, located in Globe, Arizona. Retired early/mid 1950s.
* The Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad No. 13, &quot;Empire&quot; at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California.
* The Duluth &amp; Iron Range Railroad No. 3 in Two Harbors, Minnesota.
* The Boston &amp; Maine Railroad No. 1455 at the Danbury Railway Museum in Danbury, Connecticut. This was the last steam locomotive to regularly operate on the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad in 1956.
* The Magma Arizona Railroad No. 6 at the McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park in Scottsdale, Arizona was built in October 1907 and operated until 1960.
* The Colorado &amp; Southern Railway No. 9 at the High Line Railroad Park in Breckenridge, Colorado was built in 1884 and was retired from the Georgetown Loop Railroad in 2007.

<text>David Carson (born September 8, 1955) is an American graphic designer and design director.

== Early life and career==
CChristi]], Texas. Graduating from Rolling Hills High School, he continued his education and graduated from San Diego State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. Carson attending the Oregon College of Commercial Art studying graphic design and went to Switzerland for a workshop as a part of his degree.

Carson surfed professionally before finding employment with magazine &quot;Self and Musician&quot;. He then moved on to work at Transworld Skateboarding for four years. During those four years, he became the art director of the magazine and edited their magazine layouts. His &#x27;dirty&#x27; photographic techniques emerged during his time there. Carson was then hired as an art director at &quot;Beach Culture&quot; in 1989. Though the magazine ended after six issues, he still established a reputation for himself. Three years later Carson was hired by &quot;Ray Gun&quot;, where he stayed for three years. Carson&#x27;s style was chaotic and collage like, throughout his pieces there were layering of photos and messy typography. Most of his work was shown in his covers; they were eye-catching with the purpose to visually communicate to everyone, especially to young readers and big corporations. He later created his own design firm (&quot;David Carson Design&quot;). While working in his own design firm, he signed contracts with &quot;Nike, Pepsi Cola, Ray Bans, Levi Strauss,&quot; and &quot;MTC Global&quot;. He published a collection of his own graphic works in his books: &quot;The End of Print: The Graphic Design of David Carson&quot;, &quot;2nd Sight, Trek and Fotografiks.&quot;

== Notable awards ==
Carson received the AIGA medal in 2014: During the early 1990s, digital media started to get impacted with Modernism. Carson took advantage of this and stated, &quot;It’s the basic decisions—images, cropping and appropriate font and design choices—that make design work, not having the ability to overlap or play with opacity.&quot; Ray Gun was the platform that Carson&#x27;s visual concepts made famous. Looking back into that time Carson explains, &quot;Graphic design seems a bit stagnant now, and a lot of people and ideas have gone to other areas of expression.&quot; Carson received this award for forging graphic design into a cultural form with his own shape and direction.

<doc id="1089065" wikidata="Q147662" url="?curid=1089065" title="Zara (retailer)">
<text>Zara (; ) is a fast fashion retail subsidiary of the Spanish multinational fashion design, manufacturing, and retailing group Inditex. Zara sells clothing, accessories, beauty products and perfumes. The head office is located at Arteixo in the province of A Coruña, Spain. In 2020 alone, it launched over twenty new product lines.

==History==

===Early history===
Zara was established by Amancio Ortega Gaona in 1975. Their first shop was in central A Coruña, in Galicia, Spain, where the company is still based. They initially called it &#x27;Zorba&#x27; after the classic 1964 film &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, but after learning there was a bar with the same name two blocks away, rearranged the letters to read &#x27;Zara&#x27;. It is believed the extra &#x27;a&#x27; came from an additional set of letters that had been made for the company. It sold low-priced lookalike products of popular, higher-end clothing fashions. He subsequently opened more shops in Spain. During the 1980s, Zara changed the design, manufacturing, and distribution process to reduce lead times and react more quickly to new trends – what Ortega called &quot;instant fashions&quot; – using information technology and groups of designers rather than individuals.

===Expansion===
The first shop outside Spain was opened in 1985 in Porto, Portugal. In 1989, the company entered the United States, and then France in 1990. During the 1990s, Zara expanded to Mexico (1992), Greece, Belgium, Sweden (1993) and Israel (1997). 

In the 2000s, Zara opened its first stores in Brazil (2000); Japan and Singapore (2002); Ireland, Venezuela, Russia and Malaysia (2003); China, Morocco, Estonia, Hungary and Romania (2004); the Philippines, Costa Rica and Indonesia (2005); Colombia (2007); and South Korea (2008). 

In the 2010s, Zara began to roll out locations in India (2010); Taiwan, South Africa and Australia (2011); and Peru (2012).

In September 2010, Zara launched its online boutique. The website began in Jordan. In November of the same year, Zara Online extended its service to five more countries: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Online stores began operating in the United States in 2011, Russia and Canada in 2013, Mexico in 2014, South Korea in 2014, Romania in 2016, India in 2017, Israel and Brazil in 2019, and Peru in 2020.

In 2015, Zara was ranked #30 on Interbrand&#x27;s list of best global brands.

In 2019, Zara updated their logo. It was designed by the French agency Baron &amp; Baron. The global fashion business Journal MDS stated that while the textile commerce of the world had gone down by 2.38%, Zara&#x27;s had risen 2.17%. Chief Executive Persson said the brand is waiting for more acceptable global rent levels to continue its expansion. In Europe, the brand planned to cut the number of retail locations beginning in 2020.

In 2021, Zara left Venezuela by the economic struggles in the country.

As of January 2023, the clothing retailer has nearly 3000 stores, including its kids and home stores. Spanning over 96 countries and continuing to grow. In April 2023, Zara left Russia by selling the business to Fashion and More Management DVCC. The brand changed its name to Maag.

== Corporate affairs ==
The key trends for Zara (including Zara Home) are as at the financial year ending 31 January:
==Products==
Zara stores have men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing as well as children&#x27;s clothing (Zara Kids). Zara Home designs are located in European stores. The majority of Zara customers are aged between 18 and about 35. After products are designed, they take 10 to 15 days to reach the stores. All of the clothing is processed through the distribution center in Spain. New items are inspected, sorted, tagged, and loaded into trucks. In most cases, the clothing is delivered within 48 hours. Zara produces over 450 million items per year.

Zara also includes accessories, shoes, swimwear, beauty and perfumes.

In May 2021, Zara launched its first beauty line, ZARA Beauty.

Under its Zara Home line, Zara launched what is believed to be the first detergent that reduces the abrasion of textile microfibres during washing. It is claimed the solution, jointly developed by Inditex and BASF Home Care and I&amp;I Solutions Europe in Spain and Germany, can reduce the release of microfibres by up to 80 per cent, depending on fabric type and washing conditions.

==Manufacturing and distribution==
Reportedly, Zara needs just one week to develop a new product and get it to stores, compared to the six-month industry average, and makes roughly 40,000 designs of which around 12,000 new designs are selected and produced each year. Zara has a policy of zero advertising; the company preferred to invest a percentage of revenues in opening new stores instead.

Zara set up its own factory in La Coruña (a city known for its textile industry) in 1980 and upgraded to reverse milk-run-type production and distribution facilities in 1990. This approach, designed by Toyota Motor Corp., was called the just-in-time (JIT) system. It enabled the company to establish a business model that allows self-containment throughout the stages of materials, manufacture, product completion, and distribution to stores worldwide within just a few days.

Most of the products Zara sells are manufactured in Spain, Portugal, China, Turkey, Morocco, Bangladesh and more recently - Armenia. While some competitors outsource all production to Asia, Zara manufactures its most fashionable items – half of all its merchandise – at a dozen company-owned factories in Spain (particularly in Galicia), Portugal (northern part) and Turkey. Clothes with a longer shelf life, such as basic T-shirts, are outsourced to low-cost suppliers, mainly in Asia.

The company can design a new product and have finished goods in its stores in four to five weeks; it can modify existing items in as little as two weeks, which results from its advanced operation management. Shortening the product life cycle means greater success in meeting consumer preferences. If a design does not sell well within a week, it is withdrawn from shops, further orders are canceled and a new design is pursued. Zara monitors customers&#x27; fashion changes. Zara has a range of basic designs that are carried over from year to year, but some fashion-forward designs can stay on the shelves less than four weeks, which encourages Zara fans to make repeat visits. An average high-street store in Spain expects customers to visit three times a year. That goes up to 17 times for Zara.

As a result of increasing competitive pressures from the online shopping market, Zara is shifting its focus onto online as well, and will consequently open fewer but larger stores in the future. In May 2022, a £1.95 return fee was implemented for some online orders in Britain and other core markets. This fee was introduced in Spain as of February 2023.

In November 2022, a pre-owned platform will also be launched via its website and app in UK. Other than posting now-unwanted Zara purchases online for sale, shoppers can book repairs and donate unwanted items online or via a store. If successful, this service will be expanded to other key markets.

Starting November 2022, Russians will be able to order products online from a range U.S. and European brands, including Nike, Zara and H&amp;M, according to an announcement from Russia&#x27;s postal service.

September 11, 2024 – Zara is expanding its secondhand clothing platform, Zara Pre-Owned, to the U.S. The service, which allows customers to sell, donate, or repair pre-owned items, is expected to launch in the U.S. by the end of October 2024. 

===Non-toxic clothing===
In 2010, Greenpeace started a dialog with Zara to ban toxics from the clothing production. Greenpeace published its &quot;Toxic threads: the big fashion stitch-up&quot; report in November 2012 as part of its Detox Campaign identifying companies that use toxic substances in their manufacturing processes. Nine days after the report was published, Zara committed to eradicating all releases of hazardous chemicals throughout its entire supply chain and products by 2020. Zara became the biggest retailer in the world to raise awareness for the Detox Campaign, and switched to a fully toxic-free production.

==Controversies==

=== Allegations of antisemitism ===
In 2007, Zara withdrew a handbag from its shelves after a customer noticed a swastika on the bag&#x27;s design. The bag came from an external supplier, and Zara claimed the symbol was not visible when the handbag was chosen. Zara withdrew the product from stores, and spokesperson Susan Suett said the bag would not have been sourced had the symbol been apparent.

In August 2014, Zara received criticism for selling a toddler T-shirt for closely resembling uniforms worn by Jewish concentration camp inmates. The T-shirt was striped and featured a yellow star similar to the Star of David. Zara said the design was inspired by &quot;the sheriff&#x27;s stars from the classic western films&quot;. Zara removed the shirt from sale a few hours after they appeared for sale, and apologized. Zara received criticism for selling the T-shirt in Israel because the country does not have sheriffs. Additionally, the word &quot;Sheriff&quot; is outlined in transparent letters on the bright yellow star. The Anti-Defamation League responded to the shirt, saying that it was offensive, but welcomed Zara&#x27;s recognition of the potential imagery and removing the shirt from sale.

=== Labour practices ===
In August 2011, a Brazilian television show accused the company of using sweatshops for their outsourced production. The Regional Superintendency of Labour and Employment of São Paulo, Brazil, closed a factory that produced Zara&#x27;s clothing for its poor labour conditions. Zara&#x27;s representatives said the accusations of slave labour made against the retailer represent a breach of the code of conduct for workshops of Inditex. The company also states factories responsible for unauthorized outsourcing have been asked to regularize immediately the situation of the workers involved.

In September 2013, Bangladeshi garment workers for suppliers to Zara and its parent company, Inditex, protested following the 2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse, demanding a monthly US$100 minimum wage. Inditex does not publicly disclose the factories that produce their branded clothing.

In 2016, BBC News stated they found evidence of child labor and exploitation in factories in Turkey. Zara replied that there were some issues in June 2016 in one single factory and, instead of solving these issues immediately, they have given a period of six months to solve them.

In November 2017, customers shopping at Zara stores in Istanbul, Turkey, found handwritten notes purportedly from Turkish workers in the pockets of in-store garments asking shoppers to pressure Zara into paying them unpaid wages. The company clarified the unpaid wages were due to a third-party manufacturer Bravo Tekstil, who had failed to pay their employees in the period up to its closing after going bankrupt. The company said they would help to provide compensation to employees who weren&#x27;t paid. In the agreement, only factory-floor employees were compensated, with &quot;white-collar&quot; employees not covered by the agreement.

In 2022, about 1,000 shop assistants who work at Zara and other fashion brands owned by Inditex went on strike on Black Friday in the company&#x27;s home town in northern Spain to demand better salaries. Prior to a second strike, Inditex, Zara&#x27;s parent company, has agreed to pay 322 euros more per month to shop assistants from 44 stores. Workers 

In December 2023, Yle reported in Finland that the local Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Regional State Administrative Agency had investigated the four Zara stores under suspicions of illegal labour practices. In the investigation it was found that the workload the employees were subjected to were illegal. In one store, 95% of respondents to the authorities&#x27; enquiry felt that the workload is unbearable.

=== Copyright infringement ===
In July 2016, complaints were made against Zara that they had been stealing designs from multiple independent designers for their products. One of the designers, Tuesday Bassen, who previously worked with brands including Urban Outfitters and Nike, contacted Zara. The company responded Bassen&#x27;s designs were not distinctive enough, and they received only a handful of complaints given the large volume of traffic they receive on their site. When the news was picked up by media outlets, Inditex, Zara&#x27;s owning company, stated that the items in question have been suspended from sale, and that they are in contact with Bassen&#x27;s lawyer to clarify and address the issue.

As of April 2018, MaXhosa by Laduma is taking legal action against Zara for copying its designs. Zara responded to complaints from the designer by removing socks that resembled his artistic style.

=== Melania Trump ===
In June 2018, a Zara jacket with &quot;I really don&#x27;t care, do u?&quot; emblazoned on the back became controversial after it was worn by Melania Trump when she visited a detention center for migrant children separated from their parents.

=== Political controversy in China ===
In January 2018, Shanghai&#x27;s internet authority summoned representatives of Zara, chastising the company for listing Taiwan as a country and ordering it to rectify the situation immediately.

In September 2019, Zara supported Hong Kong strikes; however after pressures from Chinese social media Zara was forced to issue a statement expressing its support of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy adopted by China in ruling Hong Kong, and its disapproval of anti-government strikes.

=== Xinjiang region ===
In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including Zara, of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang.

=== Allegations of anti-Palestinian bullying and imagery ===
In June 2021, the company&#x27;s women&#x27;s head fashion designer Vanessa Perilman made anti-Palestinian comments in response to Palestinian model Qaher Harhash. After receiving backlash for her comments when they were made public by Qaher, Perilman apologized and Zara later asked Qaher to post Perilman&#x27;s apology on his social media. Because of Zara&#x27;s delayed response, and decision to not fire Perilman, calls to boycott Zara emerged through social media.

In December 2023, Zara faced backlash over the release of their &quot;ZARA ATELIER. Collection 04_The Jacket.&quot; campaign. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 50 complaints about the advert, which included photos of a model posing with a mannequin wrapped in plastic, and others where the model was surrounded by rubble and rocks with a cardboard cut out of what appeared similar to the map of Palestine. Commenters likened the similarity of the promotional photos to the images of the aftermath of air strikes in Palestine and called for a boycott of the brand. The campaign was subsequently removed from their app and website, and some images removed from their Instagram account. On December 12, Zara announced that it &quot;regrets&quot; a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; about the ad campaign and that it was photographed in September.

=== Trademark Action ===

In April 2022, it was reported that Zara had taken legal action against &quot;Tara Sartoria&quot;, a small clothing company owned by Vietnamese citizen Tara Nguyen. Ms. Nguyen&#x27;s company sells products made by disadvantaged women in Indonesia and Vietnam.

==Stores==
As of November 2021, there were 2,264 stores across 96 countries.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in early 2020, Zara stores worldwide closed temporarily due to restrictions. However, in April 2020 Zara&#x27;s owner ramped up shipment to Asia as China ended its lockdown after 76 days.

<doc id="1089066" wikidata="Q7789468" url="?curid=1089066" title="Thomas F. O'Higgins">
<text>Thomas Francis O&#x27;Higgins (20 November 1890 – 1 November 1953) was an Irish Fine Gael politician and medical practitioner who served as Minister for Defence from 1948 to 1951, Minister for Industry and Commerce from March 1951 to June 1951 and Leader of the Opposition from January 1944 to June 1944. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1929 to 1932 and 1937 to 1953.

Following the killing of his father and his brother during the Irish Civil War in the 1920s, he became politically radicalised and joined Cumann na nGaedhael, as well as also briefly becoming the leader of the Blueshirts.

==Background==
O&#x27;Higgins grew up in Stradbally, County Laois, the second son of sixteen children (eight boys, eight girls) of Dr. Thomas Higgins and Anne Sullivan. His mother was the daughter of Timothy Daniel Sullivan, an Irish nationalist, journalist, politician and poet. His father&#x27;s first cousin, Tim Healy, was one of the most well known Irish MPs in the British House of Commons in the late 19th century and later the first Governor-General of the Irish Free State. Thomas grew up alongside his younger brother Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the fourth son of his parents.

O&#x27;Higgins was educated at Presentation Convent, Stradbally, the Christian Brothers’ schools in Maryborough (now Portlaoise), and Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare before studying medicine at University College Dublin. He qualified as a medical doctor in 1914. It was while practising as a Doctor in Fontstown, County Kildare, in the late 1910s, that he became a local organiser for both Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers. In 1919, he was imprisoned twice; first, he was sent to in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, and then the Curragh Camp, County Kildare, for soliciting subscriptions to the first Dáil Éireann loan.

O&#x27;Higgins status continued to grow; he became a Town Commissioner for Portlaoise in 1920, and was later arrested again for leading the people of Portlaoise in a protest after the death of Terence MacSwiney. As a result, he was sent to Abercorn Barracks in County Down, during which time his home back in Portlaoise was turned into an Officers&#x27; Mess for the Black and Tans after they evicted his wife and children.

It was in 1921, he added the prefix &quot;O&quot; to his surname, a common trend at the time, particularly amongst those involved in the Gaelic League. Those adding O to their surnames believed they were simply restoring what had been previously removed during Anglicisation in previous generations.

==Military career==
O&#x27;Higgins supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and enlisted in the National Army of the Irish Free State in 1922 during the Irish Civil War. There he was appointed captain in the medical corps, and subsequently became Medical Corps Deputy Commander and Director of Medical Services with the rank of colonel.

==The killing of his father and his brother==

On 11 February 1923, his father was killed by the Anti-Treaty IRA during a raid on his fathers&#x27; home. On 10 July 1927, his brother Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, at this point the Cumann na nGaedhael Minister for Justice, was assassinated by the IRA. During the Civil War Kevin, as Minister for Justice, had brought in severe measures to crack down on the IRA, including the introduction of the death penalty. Kevin confirmed the death sentences of 77 captured Republicans, including that of Rory O&#x27;Connor, who had been the best man at Kevin&#x27;s wedding. Both the deaths of Thomas Senior and Kevin were believed to have been in retaliation for those death sentences.

==Political career==
O&#x27;Higgins resigned his army commission to stand as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate for Dublin North at the 14 March 1929 by-election. It was there he won a narrow victory over Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Oscar Traynor.

At the 1932 general election, he switched constituencies and this time stood for Leix–Offaly, he was elected again. This was the beginning of a sixteen-year stint as a TD for Laois–Offaly.

===With the Blueshirts===
The political atmosphere of the early 1930s in Ireland was becoming increasingly divisive. The 1920s had seen the Labour Party as the main opposition in the Dáil but in 1927 Fianna Fáil dropped their abstentionism and entered the chamber, becoming the main opposition, and were much more vocally opposed to Cumann na nGaedhael than Labour had been. Fianna Fáil had been pressured to drop their abstentionism partially after Kevin O&#x27;Higgins as Minister for Justice brought forward a law that requiring all political candidates to swear that they would take the Oath of Allegiance if elected to the Dáil. Fianna Fáil eventually agreed to do so after dismissing the Oath as an &quot;Empty formula&quot;. The onset of the Great Depression further increased tensions as the economy tanked.

It was the midset of this that Fianna Fáil won the 1932 general election. Upon entry into government, Fianna Fáil set about releasing many of the political prisoners arrested by Cumann na nGaedhael in the preceding years. As a result, many members of the IRA were freed. The IRA and many released prisoners, who held Cumann na nGaedhael in contempt, began a &quot;campaign of unrelenting hostility&quot; against those associated with the former Cumann na nGaedheal government. Frank Ryan, one of the most prominent socialists in 1930s Ireland, active in the IRA and Republican Congress, declared &quot;as long as we have fists and boots, there will be no free speech for traitors&quot;. As a consequence, many Cumann na nGaedhael public meeting began to be disrupted by IRA members.

In response, former members of the National Army and supporters of the Cumann na nGaedhael party formed the Army Comrades Association (ACA), better known as the Blueshirts. The organisation began acting as stewards at Cumann na nGaedhael meetings and began engaging in street fighting with IRA members. In August 1932, O&#x27;Higgins was invited to become the leader of the ACA, which he accepted. O&#x27;Higgins was joined in the organisation by fellow Cumann na nGaedhael TDs Ernest Blythe, Patrick McGilligan and Desmond Fitzgerald. It was under O&#x27;Higgins direction that the ACA went from an association of ex-National Army members into a crusading right-wing movement hitched to Cumann na nGaedhael. O&#x27;Higgins asked ACA members to defend the right to free speech and assembly against &quot;Republican thuggery&quot;, and to defend Christian values against &quot;Communist influences&quot; he suggested were entering Ireland via the IRA.

In 1933, Fianna Fáil called a surprise election which saw them consolidate their power in the Dáil. That spring, O&#x27;Higgins handed over leadership of the ACA to Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, the former Garda Commissioner who had just been sacked by Éamon de Valera. O&#x27;Duffy took the ACA into a more radically hardline direction, renaming it the &quot;National Guard&quot; and adopting many elements of European Fascism such as the Roman straight-arm salute, uniforms and huge public rallies.

In August 1933, Fianna Fáil banned the National Guard following an aborted march on Dublin. As a result, in September the National Guard, the National Centre Party and Cumann na nGaedhael merged into one new party, Fine Gael. O&#x27;Duffy was named leader, with WT Cosgrave of CnaG replaced to avoid the idea that the new party was merely a continuation of CnaG. The National Guard, now known as the Young Ireland Association, was to act as a youth wing for the party. O&#x27;Higgins was key in battering the new alliance. Representing the National Guard in the negotiation phase, he became part of Fine Gael&#x27;s first national executive and sat on its Dáil front bench.

In September 1933, the Gardai raided the National Guard&#x27;s Dublin headquarters. In response, O&#x27;Higgins and Desmond FitzGerald led other Fine Gael TDs in wearing the blue shirt of the National Guard in the Dáil chamber. In February 1934, at Fine Gael&#x27;s first national convention, O&#x27;Higgins denounced Fianna Fáil as ‘the vanguard of the communist policy here’, and called Éamon de Valera an ‘arch-communist agent’. O&#x27;Higgins was amongst the Fine Gael leaders more open to the introduction of Corporatism policies being pushed by members of the Blueshirts such as James Hogan, Michael Tierney and Ernest Blythe.

===In Fine Gael===
O&#x27;Duffy lasted only a year as leader before being replaced by Cosgrave. O&#x27;Higgins was made vice-president of the party and in October 1936 reorganised the Blueshirts, abolishing their status as a semi-independent grouping within Fine Gael and made their officers directly responsible to the party&#x27;s standing committee. It marked the general trend of winding down the Blueshirts and merging them into the mainstream of the party.

During World War II, O&#x27;Higgins defended the right of James Dillon to speak out against the party&#x27;s stance of supporting Irish neutrality alongside Fianna Fáil. Dillon wished to see Ireland join the Allies against the Axis powers.

He became parliamentary leader of Fine Gael in 1944, while the former leader, Richard Mulcahy, was attempting to get elected to Seanad Éireann and retain his position.

===Return to government===
During the 1948 general election, O&#x27;Higgins left the Laois–Offaly constituency in order to allow his son Tom O&#x27;Higgins to successful stand there. O&#x27;Higgins stood for Cork Borough instead. In the same election, O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; other son Michael O&#x27;Higgins was also elected for Dublin South-West.

In 1948, he joined the government of John A. Costello as Minister for Defence. He served as Minister for Industry and Commerce from March 1951 to June 1951.

O&#x27;Higgins died while still in office in 1953. On 3 March 1954, Stephen Barrett of Fine Gael won the by-election for the vacant seat.

==Personal life==
On 17 October 1915, O&#x27;Higgins married Agnes McCarthy of Cork. They had four sons and one daughter together.

<text>Jeløya is an island located in the municipality of Moss in Østfold County, Norway.

==History==
Jeløya was actually a peninsula in the Oslofjord, but was divided from the mainland in 1855 by the Moss canal (&quot;Mossekanalen&quot;) a 20-meter broad canal that was built through the low isthmus. The Canal Bridge (&quot;Kanalbrua&quot;) is the link between Jeløya and the mainland at Moss. This was at first a low, sliding bridge, and since 1957 a simple-leaf Bascule bridge, but dating from the early 1990s has been locked and unable to open. Part of the city of Moss lies on the south-eastern part of Jeløya.

At 19 km2, Jeløya is the largest island in the Oslofjord. Geologically, Jeløya is largely made up of a young lava rock-type from the Permian period. Other islands in the Oslofjord formed during that same time period include Revlingen, Eldøya, Missingene and the Søsterøyene. Ringerike sandstone is found in some parts of Jeløya, and fossil cephalaspids have been found. The largest Norwegian moraine from the Ice Age crosses Jeløya, goes to the east of Moss and Rygge and continues through Sweden to Finland.

Until the 1990s, two of Moss&#x27; largest industrial zones were on the southern part of Jeløya - Moss Glassverk and Moss Verft. Moss Glassverk produced glass containers from 1898 until 1999. Moss Verft was a shipyard formed in 1870 which was active in shipbuilding until 1987 and was historically one of the biggest employers in the municipality. These areas are now turning into costly apartments and post-industrial businesses. Jeløya is today best known for its beaches, its scenery, a swarming harbor with boats, and Refsnes Gods, a hotel with a renowned cuisine.

Jeløya is the site of a number of country manor houses on farms including Grønli gård and Kubberød gård. Torderød gård is now owned by Moss Municipality which hosts tours during the summer. Grimsrød gård housed Edvard Munch for a number of years. Roed gård has been established as a combined Arts and Cultural Center. Alby gård is the site of one of Norway&#x27;s most widely known art galleries, &quot;Galleri F 15&quot;.

<doc id="1089076" wikidata="Q7367401" url="?curid=1089076" title="Rosario Marin">
<text>Rosario Marin (born August 4, 1958) is a Mexican-American politician who served as the 41st Treasurer of the United States from August 16, 2001, to June 30, 2003, serving under President George W. Bush. She is the first person since William Clark to assume the post without having been born a United States citizen. She is the only foreign-born Treasurer of the United States.

==Early life==
Marin was born Rosario Spindola in Mexico City, Mexico. Her father Mariano, a worker in a label-making factory in California, brought his family to the United States in 1972 on visas provided by his employer. The move was initially resisted by Marin due to her upcoming &quot;quinceañera&quot; and her fear of leaving behind her customs and traditions. Marin&#x27;s family settled in Huntington Park, California where her father obtained work as a janitor and her mother as a seamstress. They returned briefly to their old home in Mexico to celebrate a &quot;small fiesta&quot; in her honor.

Her poor command of English was another reason that Marin had resisted coming to the U.S. In high school, she was given an IQ test on which she scored a 27 out of 100 and was subsequently labelled as mentally disabled. This low score inspired Marin to work hard to learn the language which she accomplished in part by listening to songs on the radio and repeating the words. By 1976, she was in the top 20 out of a class of 500 and graduated with honors.

Marin&#x27;s family had initially wanted her to forgo any further education and get a job in order to help out the family financially as well as help her mother care for her siblings. Marin compromised by working during the day and attending East Los Angeles College at night. After graduating in 1980, she continued to take night classes at the Los Angeles campus of the California State University (CSULA). Marin graduated from CSULA in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.

==Public service==

===Advocacy in the Wilson Administration===
Marin originally embarked upon a business and financial career. While attending CSULA, she had obtained work in 1981 at City National Bank in Beverly Hills as an assistant receptionist. After several promotions, Marin was poised for elevation to assistant vice president of the bank. However, in 1985 her son Eric was born with Down Syndrome and she quit her job the following year in order to care for him. She also withdrew from an MBA program in which she was enrolled.

Her son&#x27;s condition inspired Marin to become an advocate for the mentally disabled. During this time, she founded the first support group for Latino parents with Down&#x27;s children as well as Fuerza (&quot;Force&quot;), an organization dedicated to providing services and support to mentally disabled children, and lobbied state officials in Sacramento on their behalf. It was also during this time, while counseling pregnant women with disabled children, that Marin became a supporter of abortion rights.

Marin&#x27;s efforts came to the notice of state officials and, in 1992, she was appointed the chief of Legislative Affairs for the Department of Developmental Services by Governor Pete Wilson. At DDS, Marin worked for legislation to benefit the mentally challenged. Two years later, Marin was named chair of the Council on Developmental Disabilities where she continued to advocate for the mentally disabled and their families. For her work on behalf of the mentally disabled, Marin received the &quot;Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Prize&quot; by the United Nations in 1995, the second person to receive the award.

Finally, in 1996, Marin was appointed the assistant deputy director for the Department of Social Services.

===Political career===
In addition to her public advocacy work, Marin became politically involved. She had been influenced to join the Republican Party (GOP) by her boss at City National after she naturalized in 1984. Additionally, Marin was inspired by what she felt she shared with the ideology of President Ronald Reagan: &quot;Personal responsibility. Small government. Strong national defense.&quot;

In 1994, while still working in the Wilson Administration, Marin ran for a city council seat in Huntington Park and won. She served seven years on the council, including a term as mayor from 1999 to 2000 – the first Hispanic to hold that post in the city&#x27;s history. During her tenure, Marin was known as a law-and-order politician and was credited with various public safety initiatives that reformed the police department, increased its funding, and reduced crime by 50%. She also instituted a task force to combat air pollution in response to a government study that listed Huntington Park as one of several communities particularly at risk and launched a crackdown on a black market for illegal documentation. Despite her political registration, Marin was overwhelmingly re-elected to the council in 1999.

Marin was also known for being a tough and, sometimes, divisive participant of council meetings. Opponents accused her of raucous behavior, while even allies acknowledged a certain arrogance. In 2000, she was censured by the council for being rude toward fellow councilmembers and citizens alike. Critics also accused her of missing council meetings and misusing her travel budget. Her improbable victory, they point out, was due to &quot;misrepresenting her true political leanings&quot; and a &quot;savvy use of the Spanish media.&quot;

Marin continued to work for Governor Wilson for the first few years of her time on the council. In 1997, she was named deputy director of the governor&#x27;s Office of Community Relations in Los Angeles. As the public face of the Administration to Hispanics, Marin had to deal with the tricky subject of Proposition 187 and other anti-illegal immigration topics which were the subject of heated debate among the community. 187 was particularly unpopular in Huntington Park – a city Marin herself referred to as &quot;the most Mexican city outside Mexico.&quot; While personally opposed to the controversial measure, Marin was called upon by the Administration to defend its position in support.

During this time, Marin served as an officer on several commissions such as president of the Mayors and Councils Department of the League of California Cities, vice-chair of the Latino Caucus, and chair of the Southeast Community Development Corporation. She was also a member of various boards such as the California Film Commission, the Special Olympics, and the National Association of Latino Elected Officials and in 1998 completed the John F. Kennedy School of Government&#x27;s program for senior executives in state and local government. In her last two years in office, Marin concurrently worked for AT&amp;T Corporation as Public Relations Manager for the Hispanic Market in the Southern California Region.

Marin continued to bolster her Republican credentials. At the state level, she served as a California delegate to the 1996 Republican National Convention. She was also a vice-president of the California Republican National Hispanic Assembly.

On the national scene, Marin was an ardent supporter of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential run in 2000. While mayor, she had met the Texas governor and volunteered in his campaign effort in California working on Hispanic outreach and acting as its Spanish-speaking surrogate. Her reputation and skill in the community was realized by Republican operatives and Marin&#x27;s political cachet within the Party increased dramatically. Shortly after his election, Marin was featured prominently among the president-elect&#x27;s circle.

In April, 2001, President Bush nominated Marin for the post of U.S. Treasurer. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 3 and resigned from her city council post three days later.

==U.S. Treasurer==

Marin was sworn in on August 16, 2001. Treasury Secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill presided over the ceremony. She became the highest ranking Latina to serve in President Bush&#x27;s Administration and, as such, was often called upon to represent it before the Hispanic community.

In addition to the Treasurer&#x27;s traditional duties of overseeing the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Marin&#x27;s tenure included organizing the Department’s first financial education outreach efforts. She also served as a member of the new Partnership for Prosperity efforts between the United States and Mexico. Marin was particularly concerned with educating young people on the importance of building and maintaining financial stability. She also served as a designee to the President&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans on behalf of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow.

Like previous US Treasurers, Marin continued to make numerous appearances on behalf of the Department, providing it with its public face. On June 15, 2002, she served as the keynote speaker at the commencement ceremony of her alma mater, CSULA, where she received an honorary Doctorate of Law degree and continued to garner praise for her achievements. That same year, she was awarded the &quot;Groundbreaking Latina of the Year&quot; award by &quot;Catalina&quot; magazine.

By April, 2003, speculation began circulating that Marin would soon return to California and become a GOP candidate to challenge US Senator Barbara Boxer in the upcoming 2004 electoral cycle. At a speech to Californians in Washington, reporters noted her attacks against the budget of Gov. Gray Davis.

On May 22, the Treasury Department issued a statement that Marin was resigning her office effective June 30, and was planning to move back to California. Press reports at the time continued to indicate that she would enter the 2004 Senatorial campaign.

===Founding of NALL===
Later in the year, Marin co-founded the National Association of Latina Leaders and served as its first chairwoman.

==US Senate campaign==
Hoping to ride the popular sentiment that toppled Democratic Gov. Davis in the recall election and installed Republican moderate Arnold Schwarzenegger in his place, Marin officially became a candidate for the Republican nomination to the US Senate on December 2. In a half-hour speech before a hometown crowd in Huntington Park, Marin painted herself as a moderate while at the same time embracing certain key conservative Republican issues such as national security and low taxes. During the ensuing campaign, she would continue to walk a political tightrope, trying to stress her centrist philosophy while not alienating the party&#x27;s conservative base.

Highlighting her Republican credentials, Marin evoked rhetoric of Ronald Reagan, proclaimed her support for President Bush&#x27;s $726 billion tax cut, and gave tough speeches about Mexico. At the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda in February 2004, Marin called for tougher US pressure on Mexico in her first major policy speech of the campaign, including adjusting existing treaties in order to deport criminal aliens. At the same time, she emphasized her own immigrant roots, backed the president&#x27;s immigrant worker program (which was unpopular with conservatives), and voiced her support for civil unions and abortion rights – the latter of which she tempered with opposition to late-term abortions and support of parental consent laws. During the same month of her Mexico speech, Marin utilized Garry South, former advisor of Gov. Davis, to send out a mailer addressing the Republicans&#x27; &quot;white male problem&quot; and offering her candidacy as the best chance to defeat Sen. Boxer.

Despite receiving an implied endorsement from the White House as the preferred candidate, Marin was attacked by her fellow Republicans, in particular, former California Secretary of State Bill Jones, the leading candidate for the GOP nod, for her perceived waffling on another hot-button immigration issue: driver&#x27;s licenses for illegal immigrants. Although she had opposed the state measure granting them signed by Gov. Davis in 2003, she refused to take a position on tough federal legislation to punish states that do so introduced by Congressman Tom Tancredo the same year. Marin was also passed over by key Republicans when Governors Schwarzenegger, her old boss Wilson, and George Deukmejian all endorsed Jones.

Critics placed doubt on Marin&#x27;s ability to raise the estimated $25 million she would need with relatively little name recognition. Her refusal to elaborate on key policy statements drew further criticism. Democrats, in the meantime, brought up her contentious terms and censure while serving as a city councilwoman and mayor. Democratic California congresswoman Hilda Solis, among others, questioned Marin&#x27;s claim that she had personally opposed Proposition 187 in 1994 – a problem particularly vexing to the state GOP – saying that she did not do enough to voice that opposition publicly. Marin&#x27;s attempts at distancing herself from more controversial GOP measures and tacking to the center were dismissed as posturing, and she was labelled by one high-ranking Hispanic Democrat as &quot;a good house Mexican for the Republicans&quot;.

By the time of the primary, there were 10 candidates in the GOP race. Despite picking up a substantial number of undecided voters on election day, Marin was unable to overcome GOP frontrunner Jones in name recognition, funding, or popularity among the party. On March 2, she finished second with 20% of the vote compared to Jones&#x27; 44%.

==Return to state politics==

===Schwarzenegger Administration===
Following her loss in the race for the US Senate, Governor Schwarzenegger appointed Marin to the Integrated Waste Management Board (IWMB), the state solid waste agency that oversees and regulates recycling. She was sworn in on April 27 and elected chair of the board by her colleagues on September 21.

On January 31, 2006, the governor appointed Marin as secretary of the California State and Consumer Services Agency (CSCSA), an agency responsible for civil rights enforcement, consumer protection and the licensing of 2.3 million Californians in more than 230 different professions. On September 7, she received a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; during the League of California Cities 108th Annual Conference.

In 2007 Rosario published her memoirs, &quot;Leading Between Two Worlds: Lessons from the First Mexican-Born Treasurer of the United States&quot;. Editorial Santillana published the Spanish version the following year. On May 10, 2008, Marin received an honorary doctorate for her achievements from Woodbury University.

Marin continued to work on behalf of the Republican Party and was a featured speaker at the 2008 Republican National Convention, addressing the crowd on September 4. The previous day, she joined several other prominent Republican women in denouncing what they considered unfair attacks on vice presidential candidate, Gov. Sarah Palin by the media, bloggers, and the Democratic Party. Marin particularly noted her connection to Palin by virtue of their both having children with Downs.

In February 2009 Marin was the keynote speaker at the California Sustainability Alliance&#x27;s 2008 Sustainability Showcase Awards where she discussed transforming the market through the implementation of California’s Green Building Initiative.

===Stealth lobbying campaign===
Later that same year, Marin was linked to a secret &quot;stealth lobbying campaign&quot; waged by Freddie Mac to influence federal regulation legislation in 2006. According to documents obtained by the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, the firm had utilized an influential lobbying agency for which she worked, the DCI Group, to target key Republican Senators. The goal of the campaign was to defeat a bill by Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) that would have overhauled the mortgage industry, including Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

In January, 2006, Marin had given an address in Helena, Montana, speaking out against Hagel&#x27;s Senate Bill 190 claiming that it was too far-reaching and would make it more difficult for people with low-incomes to become homeowners. &quot;They will no longer be able to do what they have been doing,&quot; she said referring to the mortgage industry giants.

Marin&#x27;s office confirmed that her visits to Montana and Missouri at that time were in association with her work for DCI. Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) came out against the bill which failed at the end of the 109th session of Congress as did eight of the remaining 16 senators targeted by the campaign.

===Ethics violations===
On March 5, 2009, Marin resigned her position as head of the CSCSA after inquiries by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; into speaker&#x27;s fees she had received and as the paper was preparing to publish a story concerning an ongoing investigation into her activities by the California Fair Political Practices Commission (CFPPC). A spokesman for Governor Schwarzenegger released a statement that Marin had violated administration policy that prohibits public officials from receiving speaker&#x27;s fees. Marin later fired back stating that &quot;administration officials knew what she was doing and never advised her to stop.&quot;

The &quot;Times&quot; story and CFPPC investigation revealed that between April 2004 and the end of 2007, Marin had received in excess of $50,000 for various speaking engagements through the American Program Bureau lecture agency. Additionally, forms filed by a firm established by her and her husband, Marin and Marin, LLC, indicated that she received between $10,000 and $100,000 in speaking fees. The CFPPC was particularly concerned with $15,000 Marin received from the drug company Pfizer in 2007 which was simultaneously lobbying the Board of Pharmacy, a regulatory panel under her jurisdiction, and $13,500 from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2008 when it was likewise lobbying agencies she oversaw. Marin countered that most of the speeches were &quot;inspirational&quot; in nature and that she had kept the governor&#x27;s office and state senate informed since her appointment to the IWMB. The CFPPC had initially launched its investigation after a routine review found that Marin had listed her speaking engagement fees as income.

In June, Marin settled with the CFPPC, admitting to three ethics violations of state law. Although she was subject to a $15,000 penalty, Marin&#x27;s fine was reduced to $5,400 after the Commission accepted her position that she had received &quot;bad legal advice&quot; from state attorneys and had kept the administration informed. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s office maintained that they were unaware of her speaking engagement fees.

==Family==
Marin married Alvaro &quot;Alex&quot; Marin, an immigrant from Nicaragua, in the early 1980s. Her husband also graduated from CSULA, obtaining a Sociology degree in 1979. As of 2002, he was working for the city of Los Angeles as a system analyst. She has two sons and a daughter. One of her sons, Eric, was born with Down syndrome.

== Awards ==
In 2003, Marin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.

<text>Miller indices form a notation system in crystallography for lattice planes in crystal (Bravais) lattices.

In particular, a family of lattice planes of a given (direct) Bravais lattice is determined by three integers &quot;h&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;ℓ&quot;, the &quot;Miller indices&quot;. They are written (&quot;hkℓ&quot;), and denote the family of (parallel) lattice planes (of the given Bravais lattice) orthogonal to formula_1, where formula_2 are the basis or primitive translation vectors of the reciprocal lattice for the given Bravais lattice. (Note that the plane is not always orthogonal to the linear combination of direct or original lattice vectors formula_3 because the direct lattice vectors need not be mutually orthogonal.) This is based on the fact that a reciprocal lattice vector formula_4 (the vector indicating a reciprocal lattice point from the reciprocal lattice origin) is the wavevector of a plane wave in the Fourier series of a spatial function (e.g., electronic density function) which periodicity follows the original Bravais lattice, so wavefronts of the plane wave are coincident with parallel lattice planes of the original lattice. Since a measured scattering vector in X-ray crystallography, formula_5 with formula_6 as the outgoing (scattered from a crystal lattice) X-ray wavevector and formula_7 as the incoming (toward the crystal lattice) X-ray wavevector, is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector formula_4 as stated by the Laue equations, the measured scattered X-ray peak at each measured scattering vector formula_9 is marked by &quot;Miller indices&quot;. By convention, negative integers are written with a bar, as in for −3. The integers are usually written in lowest terms, i.e. their greatest common divisor should be 1. Miller indices are also used to designate reflections in X-ray crystallography. In this case the integers are not necessarily in lowest terms, and can be thought of as corresponding to planes spaced such that the reflections from adjacent planes would have a phase difference of exactly one wavelength (2), regardless of whether there are atoms on all these planes or not.

There are also several related notations:
*the notation formula_10 denotes the set of all planes that are equivalent to formula_11 by the symmetry of the lattice.
In the context of crystal &quot;directions&quot; (not planes), the corresponding notations are:
* formula_12 with square instead of round brackets, denotes a direction in the basis of the &quot;direct&quot; lattice vectors instead of the reciprocal lattice; and
*similarly, the notation formula_13 denotes the set of all directions that are equivalent to formula_14 by symmetry.
Note, for Laue–Bragg interferences
* formula_15 lacks any bracketing when designating a reflection

Miller indices were introduced in 1839 by the British mineralogist William Hallowes Miller, although an almost identical system (&quot;Weiss parameters&quot;) had already been used by German mineralogist Christian Samuel Weiss since 1817. The method was also historically known as the Millerian system, and the indices as Millerian, although this is now rare.

The Miller indices are defined with respect to any choice of unit cell and not only with respect to primitive basis vectors, as is sometimes stated.

==Definition==

There are two equivalent ways to define the meaning of the Miller indices: via a point in the reciprocal lattice, or as the inverse intercepts along the lattice vectors. Both definitions are given below. In either case, one needs to choose the three lattice vectors a1, a2, and a3 that define the unit cell (note that the conventional unit cell may be larger than the primitive cell of the Bravais lattice, as the examples below illustrate). Given these, the three primitive reciprocal lattice vectors are also determined (denoted b1, b2, and b3).

Then, given the three Miller indices formula_16 denotes planes orthogonal to the reciprocal lattice vector:
:formula_17
That is, (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) simply indicates a normal to the planes in the basis of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors. Because the coordinates are integers, this normal is itself always a reciprocal lattice vector. The requirement of lowest terms means that it is the &quot;shortest&quot; reciprocal lattice vector in the given direction.

Equivalently, (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) denotes a plane that intercepts the three points a1/&quot;h&quot;, a2/&quot;k&quot;, and a3/&quot;ℓ&quot;, or some multiple thereof. That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the &quot;inverses&quot; of the intercepts of the plane, in the basis of the lattice vectors. If one of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (the intercept is &quot;at infinity&quot;).

Considering only (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the &quot;lattice planes&quot;), the perpendicular distance &quot;d&quot; between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) reciprocal lattice vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula: formula_18.

The related notation [hkℓ] denotes the &quot;direction&quot;:
:formula_19
That is, it uses the direct lattice basis instead of the reciprocal lattice. Note that [hkℓ] is &quot;not&quot; generally normal to the (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) planes, except in a cubic lattice as described below.

==Case of cubic structures==
For the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted &quot;a&quot;), as are those of the reciprocal lattice. Thus, in this common case, the Miller indices (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) and [&quot;hkℓ&quot;] both simply denote normals/directions in Cartesian coordinates.

For cubic crystals with lattice constant &quot;a&quot;, the spacing &quot;d&quot; between adjacent (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) lattice planes is (from above)
: formula_20.

Because of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:
*Indices in &quot;angle brackets&quot; such as ⟨100⟩ denote a &quot;family&quot; of directions which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.
*Indices in &quot;curly brackets&quot; or &quot;braces&quot; such as {100} denote a family of plane normals which are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

For face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal. However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic supercell and hence are again simply the Cartesian directions.

==Case of hexagonal and rhombohedral structures==

With hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems, it is possible to use the Bravais–Miller system, which uses four indices (&quot;h&quot; &quot;k&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;ℓ&quot;) that obey the constraint
: &quot;h&quot; + &quot;k&quot; + &quot;i&quot; = 0.
Here &quot;h&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;ℓ&quot; are identical to the corresponding Miller indices, and &quot;i&quot; is a redundant index.

This four-index scheme for labeling planes in a hexagonal lattice makes permutation symmetries apparent. For example, the similarity between (110) ≡ (110) and (10) ≡ (110) is more obvious when the redundant index is shown.

In the figure at right, the (001) plane has a 3-fold symmetry: it remains unchanged by a rotation of 1/3 (2/3 rad, 120°). The [100], [010] and the [0] directions are really similar. If &quot;S&quot; is the intercept of the plane with the [0] axis, then
: &quot;i&quot; = 1/&quot;S&quot;.

There are also &quot;ad hoc&quot; schemes (e.g. in the transmission electron microscopy literature) for indexing hexagonal &quot;lattice vectors&quot; (rather than reciprocal lattice vectors or planes) with four indices. However they do not operate by similarly adding a redundant index to the regular three-index set.

For example, the reciprocal lattice vector (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) as suggested above can be written in terms of reciprocal lattice vectors as formula_21. For hexagonal crystals this may be expressed in terms of direct-lattice basis-vectors a1, a2 and a3 as

:formula_22

Hence zone indices of the direction perpendicular to plane (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) are, in suitably normalized triplet form, simply formula_23. When &quot;four indices&quot; are used for the zone normal to plane (&quot;hkℓ&quot;), however, the literature often uses formula_24 instead. Thus as you can see, four-index zone indices in square or angle brackets sometimes mix a single direct-lattice index on the right with reciprocal-lattice indices (normally in round or curly brackets) on the left.

And, note that for hexagonal interplanar distances, they take the form
:formula_25

==Crystallographic planes and directions==

Crystallographic directions are lines linking nodes (atoms, ions or molecules) of a crystal. Similarly, crystallographic planes are &quot;planes&quot; linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes; these dense planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal:
*optical properties: in condensed matter, light &quot;jumps&quot; from one atom to the other with the Rayleigh scattering; the velocity of light thus varies according to the directions, whether the atoms are close or far; this gives the birefringence
*adsorption and reactivity: adsorption and chemical reactions can occur at atoms or molecules on crystal surfaces, these phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes;
*surface tension: the condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species; the surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface
** Pores and crystallites tend to have straight grain boundaries following dense planes
**cleavage
*dislocations (plastic deformation)
**the dislocation core tends to spread on dense planes (the elastic perturbation is &quot;diluted&quot;); this reduces the friction (Peierls–Nabarro force), the sliding occurs more frequently on dense planes;
**the perturbation carried by the dislocation (Burgers vector) is along a dense direction: the shift of one node in a dense direction is a lesser distortion;
**the dislocation line tends to follow a dense direction, the dislocation line is often a straight line, a dislocation loop is often a polygon.
For all these reasons, it is important to determine the planes and thus to have a notation system.

==Integer versus irrational Miller indices: Lattice planes and quasicrystals==

Ordinarily, Miller indices are always integers by definition, and this constraint is physically significant. To understand this, suppose that we allow a plane (&quot;abc&quot;) where the Miller &quot;indices&quot; &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; (defined as above) are not necessarily integers.

If &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; have rational ratios, then the same family of planes can be written in terms of integer indices (&quot;hkℓ&quot;) by scaling &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; appropriately: divide by the largest of the three numbers, and then multiply by the least common denominator. Thus, integer Miller indices implicitly include indices with all rational ratios. The reason why planes where the components (in the reciprocal-lattice basis) have rational ratios are of special interest is that these are the lattice planes: they are the only planes whose intersections with the crystal are 2d-periodic.

For a plane (abc) where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; have irrational ratios, on the other hand, the intersection of the plane with the crystal is &quot;not&quot; periodic. It forms an aperiodic pattern known as a quasicrystal. This construction corresponds precisely to the standard &quot;cut-and-project&quot; method of defining a quasicrystal, using a plane with irrational-ratio Miller indices. (Although many quasicrystals, such as the Penrose tiling, are formed by &quot;cuts&quot; of periodic lattices in more than three dimensions, involving the intersection of more than one such hyperplane.)

<doc id="1089080" wikidata="Q1231312" url="?curid=1089080" title="Jumala">
<text>(), () or (Mari) means in the Finnic languages and those of the Volga Finns (Mari, Erzya and Moksha languages), both the Christian God and any other deity of any religion. The word is thought to have been the name of a sky god of the ancient Finnic-speaking peoples. Jumala as a god of the sky is associated with the related Estonian , Mari and is thought to stem from an ancient tradition of the Finno-Ugric peoples.

==Etymology==
The Finnic and Mari terms for are usually considered to derive from a common Finno-Permic root . Related terms have been proposed to be found also in the Mordvinic languages: ёндол , interpretable as an old compound meaning (cf. тол ). A single 17th-century source on Mordvinic moreover mentions &quot;Jumishipas&quot; as the name of a pre-Christian deity. The exact meaning of this however remains unclear (cf. ши , пас ).

There are different theories concerning the earlier origin of the word. An Indo-Iranian origin for the name has been proposed, comparing e.g. Sanskrit , accepted in some sources but disputed in others due to the inexact meaning. A different possible origin is Baltic languages (cf. &quot;Jumis&quot; – Latvian god of the evergreen Otherworld, and his sister/wife Jumala).

This name replaced the original Finno-Ugric word for (), which is preserved in the Sámi and Permic languages but whose meaning was shifted to in Finnic. The older sense remains in the Finnish divine name &quot;Ilmarinen&quot;.

No certain equivalents are found in the Ugric languages, though a minority view proposes a connection with words meaning &#x27;good&#x27;, such as Hungarian , Northern Mansi . The source of these words has been reconstructed as rather than .

==Jumal==
In Estonia, Jumal was the name of the god of the sky. He was believed to make the earth fertile through the rains of the summer&#x27;s thunderstorms. Among the south Estonians, he was represented by a wooden statue in their homes.

In Finland, Jumala was the name of two of the Finns&#x27; sky gods, or one of two names for the sky god (cf. Ilmarinen).

According to John Martin Crawford in the preface to his translation of the Kalevala:The Finnish deities, like the ancient gods of Italy, Greece, Egypt, Vedic India or any ancient cosmogony, are generally represented in pairs, and all the gods are probably wedded. They have their individual abodes and are surrounded by their respective families. ... The heavens themselves were thought divine. Then a personal deity of the heavens, coupled with the name of his abode, was the next conception; finally this sky-god was chosen to represent the supreme Ruler. To the sky, the sky-god, and the supreme God, the term Jumala (thunder-home) was given.

Later on, the sky itself was called and the sky-god Ukko Ylijumala, literally &quot;Grandfather&quot; or &quot;Old Man Overgod&quot;. However, when Christianity came to dominate Finnish religious life in the Middle Ages and the old gods were ousted or consolidated away from the pantheon, &quot;Jumala&quot; became the Finnish name for the Christian God.

==Jómali ==
Two Old Norse texts mention a god called , worshipped in Bjarmaland: &quot;Óláfs saga helga&quot; chapter 133 and &quot;Bósa saga&quot; chapters 8-10. The attestation in is probably borrowed from the earlier . The name of this god is generally assumed to be a loanword from a Finnic language.

<doc id="1089083" wikidata="Q6422363" url="?curid=1089083" title="Knighton, Isle of Wight">
<text>Knighton is a largely deserted hamlet near Newchurch on the Isle of Wight, about 2 miles NW of Sandown. The name should be pronounced as &quot;Kay-nighton&quot; to avoid confusion with the larger village of Niton, near Ventnor.

Knighton is situated under Knighton Down and has historically always been a part of the parish of nearby Newchurch. Knighton consists of little more than a collection of farmhouses, most now turned to residential use. The only amenity in the settlement is a post-box. To the south is Knighton Sandpit Ltd which is an aggregate extraction company. The pit is also used for off-road driving events. This is however, a little way from the main residential area.

Knighton Gorges Manor in Knighton was one of the grandest manor houses on the Isle of Wight. But when the owner&#x27;s daughter married against his will, he had it demolished, rather than allowing her to inherit it.

Hugh De Morville, one of the knights responsible for the murder of Thomas Becket, fled to Knighton Gorges.

There was a medieval settlement in Knighton, but nearly all of the population moved to the nearby village of Newchurch to escape the Black Death. Flint arrow heads can still be found in fields surrounding the area. It was estimated that at one time, the hamlet contained up to 60 houses.

Jimmy Tarbuck lived at Griggs Farm in the 1980s whilst performing in the nearby town of Sandown.

Knighton is the home of the Wight Crystal drinking water company, whose water comes from Knighton.

John Wavell and Anna Cowlam farmed Knighton farm after their marriage in 1735 in Newchurch. They were the great-great-grandparents of Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell (1883-1950), former Field marshal and Viceroy of India.

==Ghost stories==
The area and house are said to be haunted by various ghosts and are a popular stop for ghost tourists. One story often told is that of Sir Tristram Dillington, M.P. for Newport, who is thought to have committed suicide after taking to gambling heavily after the death of his wife. His valet is said to have concealed the nature of his death by placing his corpse upon his horse, Thunderbolt, and driving it into the lake, ensuring that the property was not forfeited. The story is that the ghost of Sir Tristram rides a ghostly horse each year on the anniversary of his death, which occurred on 7 July 1721. The most famous haunting is said to take place on New Year&#x27;s Eve when, it is claimed, the old house &quot;re-appears&quot;, many people often gather at the spot on 31 December to try to witness the apparition.

<doc id="1089094" wikidata="Q901256" url="?curid=1089094" title="Daitoku-ji">
<text>is a Buddhist temple, one of fourteen autonomous branches of the Rinzai school of Japanese Zen. It is located in Kita-ku, Kyoto, Japan. The &quot;mountain name&quot; (&quot;sangō&quot;) by which it is known is . The Daitoku-ji temple complex today covers more than .

==History==
Daitoku-ji originated as a small monastery founded in 1315 or 1319 by the monk , who is known by the title &quot;Daitō Kokushi&quot; (&quot;National Teacher of the Great Lamp&quot;) given by Emperor Go-Daigo. In 1325, the monastery was converted into a supplication hall for the imperial court at the request of the retired Emperor Hanazono. The dedication ceremony for the imperial supplication hall, with its newly added dharma hall and abbot&#x27;s living quarters, was held in 1326, and this is generally recognized as the true founding of the temple.

Like many other temples in Kyoto during that time, the temple&#x27;s buildings were destroyed by fire. In 1474, which was when Kyoto was the scene of the Ōnin War, Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado designated Ikkyū Sōjun as the head priest. With the help of merchants of the city of Sakai, Ikkyū contributed significantly to the temple&#x27;s rehabilitation.

From its earliest days, the temple experienced alternating periods of fortune and decline. This can be attributed to the rivalries and conflicts between Daitoku-ji and other well-known Zen temples, as well as between Daitoku-ji and the political authorities.

Daitoku-ji became particularly important from the sixteenth century, when it was predominantly supported by members of the military establishment, who sponsored the building of subsidiary temples as prayers for their ancestors or in preparation for their own demise.
In 1582, Toyotomi Hideyoshi buried his predecessor, Oda Nobunaga, at Daitoku-ji. He also contributed land and built the Sōken-in.

Around this period in history, Daitoku-ji became closely linked to the master of the Japanese tea ceremony, Sen no Rikyū, and consequently to the realm of the Japanese tea ceremony. After the era of Sen no Rikyū, another famous figure in the history of the Japanese tea ceremony who left his mark at this temple was Kobori Enshū.

==Buildings==
There are several buildings in the complex:

*Sanmon (Mountain Gate)
*Butsuden (Buddha Hall)
*Hattō (Dharma Hall)
*Hōjō (Abbot&#x27;s Quarters)
*Yokushitsu (Bath House)
*Kyōzō (Sutra Library)

==Treasures==
Daitoku-ji is home to some works by the 13th-century Chinese artist-monk Mu Qi: 
* the acclaimed painting &quot;Six Persimmons&quot; (housed in Ryūkō-in, the painting is hardly ever put on display)
* the 

==Sub-temples==
Daitoku-ji operates some twenty-two sub-temples, the most significant being Daisen-in, , and .

<doc id="1089096" wikidata="Q5267373" url="?curid=1089096" title="Devilled kidneys">
<text>Devilled kidneys is a Victorian British breakfast dish consisting of lamb&#x27;s kidneys cooked in a spiced sauce, referred to as &quot;devilling&quot;. It has since become more frequently used as a supper-time dish.

==Description==
The devilling mixture consists of Worcestershire sauce, mustard, butter, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper.

James Boswell described devilling during the 18th century, although it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that devilled kidneys grew in popularity as a breakfast dish. During the Edwardian era, the dish was typically served in gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, and was part of a cuisine which also included items such as kedgeree or kippers. In the modern era it has mostly been promoted as a supper dish instead of at breakfast.

===Variations===
British celebrity chef Rick Stein created a recipe combining devilled kidneys with wild mushrooms to create an entrée. The dish is often included in cookbooks, with versions gracing the covers of books by the Canteen restaurant, as well as books by The Hairy Bikers. Chef Fergus Henderson described Caroline Conran&#x27;s version of devilled kidneys as &quot;the best recipe, ever!&quot;, and Marco Pierre White created devils kidneys for the celebrities in one of his seasons of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

<doc id="1089097" wikidata="Q7041346" url="?curid=1089097" title="Niton">
<text>Niton is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Niton and Whitwell, on the Isle of Wight, England. It is west of Ventnor, with a population of 2,082. It has two pubs, several churches, a pottery workshop/shop, a pharmacy, a busy volunteer-run library, a medical centre and two local shops including a post office. The post office includes a pub and café that serves as a local meeting place. The village also offers a primary school with a co-located pre-school and nursery.

==Geography==

Niton village is split in half by a break in the inner cliff of the Undercliff, through which passes the main road. Upper Niton lies in a hollow and is set around a crossroads.

The lower part of the village, below the inner cliff and above Reeth Bay, is known as Niton Undercliff, and was a small fishing hamlet up until the 19th century. This part of Niton then flourished in Victorian times due to the popularity of Ventnor as a health resort, and many mansions and holiday cottages were built there.

Mount Cleves House was originally constructed in the late 1700s, and substantially remodelled in the early 1800s. Its residents included a Mr Kirkpatrick who owned the Isle of Wight Bank at the time and the owner of the Mortimer Foundry in Newport.

The road along the Undercliff continues east towards Ventnor, but a major landslip in February 2014 has closed it to vehicular traffic between Niton and Ventnor, although it remains open for walkers and riders. The Undercliff at Niton includes the most southerly point of the Isle of Wight, St. Catherine&#x27;s Point and St. Catherine&#x27;s Lighthouse. That is also where the Navtex transmitting station is located.

The source of the Eastern Yar is in the parish, just north of the village.

Niton together with Whitwell is a civil parish.

==History==
Prehistoric lithic implements dating to the lower Palaeolithic constitute the oldest evidence of occupation of the area by hominids at some point in the early to mid Pleistocene. These are namely Acheulean handaxes, that have been discovered on the Undercliff coastline beneath the village. Later prehistoric findspots show evidence of mesolithic and neolithic activity.

Bronze Age round barrows are situated at several points on St Catherine&#x27;s Down. These were used as burial monuments and perhaps territorial markers by Bronze Age communities. The historical parish boundary with Chale to the north follows these barrows, tentatively suggesting this is an ancient boundary between neighbouring communities that has persisted. Further Bronze Age evidence has been found at St Catherine&#x27;s Point.

Close to Niton is the sheltered and remote Puckaster Cove, which was once proposed to have been used by Greek and Phoenician traders during the Bronze Age. Although this is not widely accepted and little evidence exists to support the claim.

Evidence of Roman and Iron Age occupation has been found at St Catherine&#x27;s Point, which may have been the site of a Roman military outpost, most likely a beacon or signal station. Some of these finds include middens, with one containing the skeletal remains of a young girl.

On 1 April 1933 the parish of Whitwell was merged with Niton. On 1 December 1980, the new parish was renamed to &quot;Niton &amp; Whitwell&quot;. In 1931 the civil parish of Niton (prior to the merge) had a population of 868.

==Niton lighthouse==
St. Catherine&#x27;s Lighthouse was bombed in World War II, receiving a direct hit on the boiler house that killed three lighthouse keepers, Principal Keeper R T Grenfell, Assistant Keeper C. Tompkins and Assistant Keeper W.E. Jones. The lighthouse itself was only slightly damaged, its lens only being chipped. 

Catherine&#x27;s Lighthouse was automated in 1997 with the keepers leaving the lighthouse on 30 July.[1]

The 1904 optic remained in use until being removed as part of modernisation and safety works in 2021.


==Niton Church==
==Radio==
Marconi used Knowles Farm in Niton for radio experiments, when he was living on the island in the late 1890s and early 1900s. In January 1901, he transmitted radio signals a record 186 miles from there to his Lizard Radio Telegraph Station at the southern tip of Cornwall. The farm has a stone into which is cut the inscription, &quot;This is to commemorate that Marconi set up a wireless experimental station here in A.D. 1900&quot;. While in Niton, Marconi stayed at the Royal Sandrock Hotel, which no longer exists.

A ship-to-shore radio station was established in 1900, and Niton Radio (callsign GNI) was maintained as a coastal radio station known to yachtmasters. It was featured in a British Telecom International information film. It finally closed, along with the rest of the coastal radio network, in 1997. The Navtex transmitter at St. Catherine&#x27;s Lighthouse is still in operation as of 2013 (Navtex is a shore-to-ship service). For the purpose of extended Shipping forecasts, the Met Office uses Niton as the name of the forecast area covering the Atlantic from FitzRoy, North to Irish Sea and East to Thames.

==Transport==
Southern Vectis bus route 6 serves the village on its way between Newport and Ventnor. During the summer, the &quot;Island Coaster&quot; also runs through the village.

==Notable people==
Penrhyn Grant Jones, British Consul, China and Assistant Judge of the British Supreme Court for China grew up in Niton.

<doc id="1089106" wikidata="Q898597" url="?curid=1089106" title="Cross-link">
<text>In chemistry and biology, a cross-link is a bond or a short sequence of bonds that links one polymer chain to another. These links may take the form of covalent bonds or ionic bonds and the polymers can be either synthetic polymers or natural polymers (such as proteins).

In polymer chemistry &quot;cross-linking&quot; usually refers to the use of cross-links to promote a change in the polymers&#x27; physical properties.

When &quot;crosslinking&quot; is used in the biological field, it refers to the use of a probe to link proteins together to check for protein–protein interactions, as well as other creative cross-linking methodologies.

Although the term is used to refer to the &quot;linking of polymer chains&quot; for both sciences, the extent of crosslinking and specificities of the crosslinking agents vary greatly.

==Synthetic polymers==
Crosslinking generally involves covalent bonds that join two polymer chains. The term &quot;curing&quot; refers to the crosslinking of thermosetting resins, such as unsaturated polyester and epoxy resin, and the term &quot;vulcanization&quot; is characteristically used for rubbers. When polymer chains are crosslinked, the material becomes more rigid. The mechanical properties of a polymer depend strongly on the cross-link density. Low cross-link densities increase the viscosities of polymer melts. Intermediate cross-link densities transform gummy polymers into materials that have elastomeric properties and potentially high strengths. Very high cross-link densities can cause materials to become very rigid or glassy, such as phenol-formaldehyde materials.

In one implementation, unpolymerized or partially polymerized resin is treated with a crosslinking reagent. In vulcanization, sulfur is the cross-linking agent. Its introduction changes rubber to a more rigid, durable material associated with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing. In most cases, cross-linking is irreversible, and the resulting thermosetting material will degrade or burn if heated, without melting. Chemical covalent cross-links are stable mechanically and thermally. Therefore, cross-linked products like car tires cannot be recycled easily.

A class of polymers known as thermoplastic elastomers rely on physical cross-links in their microstructure to achieve stability, and are widely used in non-tire applications, such as snowmobile tracks, and catheters for medical use. They offer a much wider range of properties than conventional cross-linked elastomers because the domains that act as cross-links are reversible, so can be reformed by heat. The stabilizing domains may be non-crystalline (as in styrene-butadiene block copolymers) or crystalline as in thermoplastic copolyesters.

Alkyd enamels, the dominant type of commercial oil-based paint, cure by oxidative crosslinking after exposure to air.

===Physical cross-links===
In contrast to chemical cross-links, physical cross-links are formed by weaker interactions. For example, sodium alginate gels upon exposure to calcium ions, which form ionic bonds that bridge between alginate chains. Polyvinyl alcohol gels upon the addition of borax through hydrogen bonding between boric acid and the polymer&#x27;s alcohol groups. Other examples of materials which form physically cross-linked gels include gelatin, collagen, agarose, and agar agar.

==Measuring degree of crosslinking==
Crosslinking is often measured by swelling tests. The crosslinked sample is placed into a good solvent at a specific temperature, and either the change in mass or the change in volume is measured. The more crosslinking, the less swelling is attainable. Based on the degree of swelling, the Flory Interaction Parameter (which relates the solvent interaction with the sample), and the density of the solvent, the theoretical degree of crosslinking can be calculated according to Flory&#x27;s Network Theory.

Two ASTM standards are commonly used to describe the degree of crosslinking in thermoplastics. In ASTM D2765, the sample is weighed, then placed in a solvent for 24 hours, weighed again while swollen, then dried and weighed a final time. The degree of swelling and the soluble portion can be calculated. In another ASTM standard, F2214, the sample is placed in an instrument that measures the height change in the sample, allowing the user to measure the volume change. The crosslink density can then be calculated.

==In biology==
===Lignin===
Lignin is a highly crosslinked polymer that comprises the main structural material of higher plants. A hydrophobic material, it is derived from precursor monolignols. Heterogeneity arises from the diversity and degree of crosslinking between these lignols.

===In DNA===

Intrastrand DNA crosslinks have strong effects on organisms because these lesions interfere with transcription and replication. These effects can be put to good use (addressing cancer) or they can be lethal to the host organism. The drug cisplatin functions by formation of intrastrand crosslinks in DNA. Other crosslinking agents include mustard gas, mitomycin, and psoralen.

===Proteins===
In proteins, crosslinks are important in generating mechanically stable structures such as hair and wool, skin, and cartilage. Disulfide bonds are common crosslinks. Isopeptide bond formation is another type of protein crosslink.

The process of applying a permanent wave to hair involves the breaking and reformation of disulfide bonds. Typically a mercaptan such as ammonium thioglycolate is used for the breaking. Following this, the hair is curled and then &quot;neutralized&quot;. The neutralizer is typically an acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide, which causes new disulfide bonds to form, thus permanently fixing the hair into its new configuration.

Compromised collagen in the cornea, a condition known as keratoconus, can be treated with clinical crosslinking.

In biological context crosslinking could play a role in atherosclerosis through advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which have been implicated to induce crosslinking of collagen, which may lead to vascular stiffening.

====Research====
Proteins can also be cross-linked artificially using small-molecule crosslinkers. This approach has been used to elucidate protein–protein interactions. Crosslinkers bind only surface residues in relatively close proximity in the native state. Common crosslinkers include the imidoester crosslinker dimethyl suberimidate, the N-Hydroxysuccinimide-ester crosslinker BS3 and formaldehyde. Each of these crosslinkers induces nucleophilic attack of the amino group of lysine and subsequent covalent bonding via the crosslinker. The zero-length carbodiimide crosslinker EDC functions by converting carboxyls into amine-reactive isourea intermediates that bind to lysine residues or other available primary amines. SMCC or its water-soluble analog, Sulfo-SMCC, is commonly used to prepare antibody-hapten conjugates for antibody development.

An &quot;in-vitro&quot; cross-linking method is PICUP (photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins). Typical reagents are ammonium persulfate (APS), an electron acceptor, the photosensitizer tris-bipyridylruthenium (II) cation (). In &quot;in-vivo&quot; crosslinking of protein complexes, cells are grown with photoreactive diazirine analogs to leucine and methionine, which are incorporated into proteins. Upon exposure to ultraviolet light, the diazirines are activated and bind to interacting proteins that are within a few ångströms of the photo-reactive amino acid analog (UV cross-linking).

<doc id="1089111" wikidata="Q3400126" url="?curid=1089111" title="Pottery Barn">
<text>Pottery Barn is an American upscale home furnishing store chain and e-commerce company, with retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia. Pottery Barn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Pottery Barn also operates several specialty stores such as Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen. It has three retail catalogues: the traditional Pottery Barn catalogue; Pottery Barn Bed + Bath to focus on its bed and bath lines; and one for outdoor furniture.

==Early history==
The Pottery Barn was co-founded in 1949 by Paul Secon and his brother Morris in Chelsea, Manhattan. Paul discovered three barns full of pottery from the factory of Glidden Parker in Alfred, New York, who had stored extras and seconds up the road from the business, hence the inspiration of the chain&#x27;s name. The Secon brothers built their chain up to seven stores. Paul sold his share in 1966 and Morris sold his to a pair of outside partners in 1968. The new owner expanded the chain to 13 stores before selling it to The Gap in 1984.

The company was acquired by Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1986. Growth continued until the Great Recession. Its mail-order catalog was first published in 1987. In 1999, the company introduced Pottery Barn Kids as a premium children&#x27;s home furnishing and accessories brand. By 2000, the company had launched an e-commerce site for quick ordering process.

Pottery Barn Teen, the first home retailer to focus on teenagers, was launched in 2003. The first Pottery Barn Teen store opened in Georgia in 2009, as well as in New York City and Chicago. The store has a sub-brand Pottery Barn Dorm for young people starting college life.

==Later history==
In 2017, the company introduced an augmented reality app for iOS that allowed users to virtually place Pottery Barn products into a room and save room design ideas. It also announced PB Apartment, a small-space furnishings line, for millennials.

In 2018, Pottery Barn Kids partnered with John Lewis which marked the first appearance of the brand in the United Kingdom. Its shop-in-shops featured furniture and accessories for nurseries. Ireland became the first European country to hold the franchise for Pottery Barn Kids in 2019. Pottery Barn Teens partnered with Aquafil on the Spring 2020 collection &quot;Watercolor Dots&quot; rug, which uses regenerated nylon made from waste gathered in the ocean and other bodies of water.

==In popular culture==
Pottery Barn is referenced a number of times in &quot;Friends&quot;. For instance, when Rachel buys furniture for Phoebe&#x27;s apartment (which she is staying in at the time), and claims it&#x27;s all authentically old furniture, rather than being from Pottery Barn.

Another example is in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Kramer talks with Jerry about how he is receiving too many catalogs from Pottery Barn. He saves the collected catalogs, takes them, and throws them into the store. 

Sheldon Cooper references it often in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. 

A Pottery Barn retail store is seen situated next to Felix Unger&#x27;s Manhattan F.U. Enterprises office/studio in &quot;The Odd Couple&#x27;s&quot; first season in 1970. 

Pottery Barn is referenced in the Broadway musical &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, as a location where the title character works. He informs another character that he can get her and her family a discount in &quot;overpriced home décor.&quot; 

In the season 3 episode of the American family sitcom Boy Meets World titled &quot;What I Meant to Say&quot;, Corey Matthews confesses to his girlfriend, Topanga Lawrence, that he loves her. Eric Matthews, Corey&#x27;s older brother, then under social pressure, tells his girlfriend, Christie, that he loves her as well. This leads Christie to take Eric on a trip to Pottery Barn, which Eric laments. While at Pottery Barn, Eric and Christie buy a ceramic cat and napkin holders.

The brand&#x27;s &quot;Found&quot; collection sells vintage items from around the world. The company has partnered on collections with a number of pop cultural brands such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot;.

<doc id="1089116" wikidata="Q6376341" url="?curid=1089116" title="Katherine D. Ortega">
<text>Katherine Dávalos Ortega (born July 16, 1934) is a former politician who was the 38th Treasurer of the United States. She served from September 26, 1983 to July 1, 1989 under Presidents Ronald Reagan and then George H. W. Bush. Ortega also has the distinction of being the first female bank president in the state of California.

==Early life==
Ortega was born in Tularosa, New Mexico to Donaciano Ortega and Catarina Dávalos. She was one of nine children. Her family had originally come to New Mexico when the area still comprised a territory. Ortega&#x27;s paternal grandfather arrived from Texas in the 1880s while on her mother&#x27;s side, her great-grandfather Luciano had been one of the original settlers of Tularosa in 1862.

Ortega&#x27;s father, a former Justice of the Peace in nearby Bent, opened a blacksmith shop in Tularosa in 1928. By the 1940s, he owned a small restaurant with a dance hall attached in which the entire family worked. Ortega began to work in the restaurant at age 10, operating the cash register. Originally, Ortega grew up speaking only Spanish. She later learned English when she entered the local elementary school.

As a teenager, Ortega worked as a teller at Otero County State Bank in order to earn enough money for college. She attended Eastern New Mexico University and graduated with honors in 1957 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Business and Economics. Initially wanting to become a teacher, Ortega was dismayed by repeated instances of discrimination and, instead, opened a small accounting firm in Alamogordo with one of her sisters, a certified public accountant. The family had already relocated to that town when her father moved the growing restaurant business there in the 1940s and opened a furniture store.

==Banking career==
In 1968, Ortega moved to Los Angeles where she became a CPA and joined the firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Company as a tax supervisor. She also worked as a cashier at Pan American National Bank, a financial institution founded in 1963 by Romana Acosta Bañuelos. Ortega became vice president of the bank in 1971 the same year that Bañuelos was sworn-in as U.S. Treasurer. Finally, in 1975, Ortega became president of Santa Ana State Bank, the first woman chief executive of a bank in the state.

Ortega returned to New Mexico in 1977 in order to help run the family accounting firm. Under her stewardship, the company grew into the Otero Savings and Loan Association and, by 1983, had assets of $20 million. During this time, Ortega garnered numerous academic and business accolades for her efforts.

==Political appointments==
Ortega was involved in Republican Party politics from an early age. &quot;I was born a Republican,&quot; she has been quoted on several occasions. She often credited her father, a lifelong Republican, with her decision to join the Party.

Ortega worked for Republicans at local and state levels initially as a type of low-key liaison to women and Hispanic groups in New Mexico. After her return to her home state, she became involved in the 1978 re-election campaign of Sen. Pete Domenici. In time, the senator became something of a political benefactor.

In April 1982, Ortega was named to a 10-person Presidential Advisory Committee on Small and Minority Business Ownership by President Ronald Reagan. In December, she was appointed one of five members and chair of the Copyright Royal Commission, a federal agency established in 1976 to set royalty fees for the cable television and music entertainment industries. In 1983, Sen. Domenici, by that time chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, put forth Ortega&#x27;s name for the post of U.S. Treasurer. She was officially nominated by President Reagan on September 12 of that year.

==U.S. Treasurer==
Ortega was sworn in on October 3, 1983 (however, she is listed by the Treasury Department as having begun her term on September 26). She was the tenth consecutive woman and the second-ever Hispanic to hold the office. At her swearing-in ceremony, three previous U.S. Treasurers attended: Francine Irving Neff, Bañuelos, and her immediate predecessor, Bay Buchanan.

While Treasurer, Ortega oversaw a $220 million budget, raised $40 million toward the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, and helped to design a new currency to aid in preventing counterfeiting. She also spearheaded the effort to have the West Point Bullion Depository designated as an official United States Mint.

Although soft-spoken in personal conversation, Ortega became known for her rhetorical speaking skills in public. &quot;Her low-key authenticity works magic with an audience,&quot; one Treasury Department official is quoted as saying. In 1984, she was chosen to be the keynote speaker at that year&#x27;s Republican National Convention- the first Hispanic woman to deliver the lead speech at a national convention. This was done in part to counter the selection of prominent New York governor Mario Cuomo at the Democratic National Convention.

As the highest-ranking Hispanic (until the appointment of Lauro Cavazos as Secretary of Education in 1988) and one of only a few high-profile women in the Administration combined with the largely ceremonial nature of the Treasurer&#x27;s office, Ortega was one of the key personnel utilized by the White House in outreach to both the Hispanic community and women&#x27;s organizations. In 1984 alone, she logged almost 60,000 miles in appearances before Republican and Hispanic groups.

In 1986, Ortega conducted a study that rejected the idea of changing the colors of $50 and $100 denomination bills in order to frustrate counterfeiters and drug lords with large amounts of such type of cash. This idea would later be partially incorporated into U.S. currency during subsequent administrations.

After Reagan left office, Ortega was retained by the George H. W. Bush administration and reappointed to her post on January 20, 1989. She retired from the office in July and returned to her family firm in New Mexico.

==Post-Treasurer years==
While Ortega returned to the private sector and business activities, she still maintained a low profile in political circles. In 1990, she was appointed by President Bush to serve as an Alternate Representative to the United Nations General Assembly for the duration of his administration. She also worked in an advisory capacity for the National Park Service and the non-profit organization, Executive Women in Government.

Ortega served on the Boards of a number of large corporations: Ralston-Purina, Rayonier, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, and, since 1992, Kroger. She has also continued her efforts on behalf of women in business while working at Catalyst, a business and research advisory firm. Ortega has received honorary degrees from Kean University, Villanova University, and her alma mater, Eastern New Mexico.

===Sicpa investigation===
Ortega&#x27;s years as Treasurer came partially under scrutiny in 1992 when Sen. John Glenn, then chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, investigated irregularities in the competitive bidding process used by the Treasury Department. Sen. Glenn&#x27;s committee questioned the relationship between Robert J. Leuver, then director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and Maurice Amon, president of Sicpa Industries of America – the sole provider of the ink used for U.S. currency since 1982. In particular, Sen. Glenn was concerned over gifts and other gratuities received by Leuver from Amon&#x27;s company. One focus of the investigation was a business trip taken to the Far East by several government and business officials, including Ortega, Leuver, and Amon, in 1985. Ortega was not implicated in any wrongdoing and Leuver was also exonerated from any impropriety during the course of the investigation. The Department of Justice declined to investigate the matter due to insufficient evidence supporting the claims.

In 2002, Ortega&#x27;s achievements from humble beginnings were recognized by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans when she received the organization&#x27;s Horatio Alger Award.

==Family life==
Ortega has cited her family upbringing as her chief inspiration in life:

I am the product of a heritage that teaches strong family devotion, a commitment to earning a livelihood by hard work, patience, determination and .

She has often singled out her father in particular, saying that &quot;[he] taught me we were as good as anybody else, that we could accomplish anything we wanted ...&quot;

Ortega was married briefly when she returned to New Mexico in the late 1970s. In interviews, she has declined to elaborate on that part of her life, insisting only that she be referred to as &quot;Mrs. Ortega&quot;. In 1989, she married Lloyd J. Derrickson, a former general counsel with Merrill Lynch and currently a board member with World Cell, a wireless communications consulting firm. She has no children.

<doc id="1089123" wikidata="Q1047009" url="?curid=1089123" title="Disney Store">
<text>The Disney Store is a chain of specialty stores created on March 28, 1987, and sells only Disney related items, many of them exclusive, under its own name and Disney Outlet. It is a business unit of the Disney Experiences division of The Walt Disney Company.

Disney Store was the first &quot;retail-tainment&quot;, or entertainment store. The company had operated a number of store chains beyond its flagship Disney Store chain such as ESPN-The Store and the short-lived Mickey&#x27;s Kitchen restaurant. Currently, the company operates the stand-alone stores, Disney Baby, Walt Disney Gallery and Disney&#x27;s Soda Fountain and Studio Store. Disney Store was a partner for Disney at Harrods, which included a Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique salon.

North America stores were owned and operated by The Children&#x27;s Place&#x27;s subsidiary Hoop Holdings from 2004 to 2008. The Oriental Land Company&#x27;s subsidiary Retail Networks Co., Ltd. owned and operated the Japanese stores from 2002 to 2010. Since 2012, Disney departments exist in JCPenney in about 520 JCPenney locations. In India, two licensed chains, Disney Jeans and Disney Artist, are owned and operated by Indus Clothing and Ravi Jaipuria Corporation respectively. At the 2019 D23 Expo, it was announced that Disney departments were opening at Target stores across the United States starting in October prior to the release of &quot;Frozen II&quot;. Disney Store items are also being sold on Target.com in addition to the Disney Store website (previously known as &quot;shopDisney&quot; from 2017 to 2024).

Disney&#x27;s Character Warehouse Outlet Store was licensed out to liquidator Asset Management &amp; Sales LLC to sell overstock and discontinued Disney Parks merchandise. The Character Warehouses just have a few permanent locations while having temporary stores at times. Asset Management &amp; Sales is owned by Janie and Gary Stump.

==History==
The first Disney Store opened in the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, California, on March 28, 1987.

The first Disney Store outside California opened in Bridgewater Commons in Bridgewater, New Jersey, on June 18, 1988.

The first overseas Disney Store opened in November 1990 in London, England.

Doug Murphy was hired by Disney Store as manager of new business development in September 1991, then promoted to head business development in April 1993. The first Japanese location opened in 1992 as did the first Australian store. In 1992, Disney Dollars were available at Disney Stores.

A showcase location was opened in the third quarter 1994 at the Post and Powell corner of San Francisco&#x27;s Union Square. On October 24, 1994, its Disney Store (Hong Kong) Ltd. opened its first location in a New Territories shopping center. In 1996, Disney Store opened its flagship location in New York City. A Disney Store location opened next to the El Capitan Theatre in its building in 1998.

The first Walt Disney Gallery opened outside of the park next to the Disney Store at Main Place Santa Ana in California on November 4, 1994 and was operated by Disney Store. Doug Murphy was appointed vice president of the Walt Disney Gallery for Disney Store in December 1994.

In 2000, its store in Munich was closed. In September 2000, Disney Store remodeled two stores, showing off prototype designs in Costa Mesa and Cherry Hill, N.J. These stores had more space and a high-tech look where theme park tickets could be bought via computer stations. When Disney indicated that this new model would be rolled out to 350 stores, they also indicated the closure of 100 locations worldwide. Analysts had indicated that Disney had overbuilt stores. By April 2001, 20 stores were redone in the high tech style when a new president, Peter Whitford, was hired.

In late 2002, two new prototypes were rolled out in Canoga Park and Torrance. In March 2002, Disney Stores Worldwide announced that the chain would be split into two types of stores, Disney Play and Disney Kids at Home. They also continued closing stores to reach 350 by 2005. The Disney Play stores would stock Disney character toys, plush dolls and costumes aimed at young children, while Disney Kids at Home targeted parents looking to purchase home furnishings, clothing and bed &amp; bath products for their children. Some were expected to be a hybrid of both concepts. This roll out of the two store brands was expected to take 3 years. On March 31, 2003, its 16 Australian locations closed.

With lackluster films, high-priced and high-margin items, sales dropped while continuing to overly open stores. The company closed hundreds of stores in order to make a slim profit. Whitford left in 2003.

===Licensed out North American and Japanese operations===
Even though the Disney Stores maintained strong sales, mounting costs of sales and operation, and the loss of key executives who had driven the Disney Stores to success led The Walt Disney Company to convert the Disney Stores into a licensed operation. The Japanese stores were sold to The Oriental Land Company in 2002, while most North American stores were sold and licensed in November 2004 to The Children&#x27;s Place.

The Walt Disney Company decided to keep the stores in Europe, along with the flagship store in Manhattan, which was converted into a World of Disney store run by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in 2004, while The Children&#x27;s Place got the Chicago flagship location. On June 2, 2005, the Disney&#x27;s Soda Fountain and Studio Store opened up in the El Capitan Building on the ground floor replacing a Disney Store.

Disney sold the chain for the cost of inventory to the Children&#x27;s Place&#x27;s subsidiary Hoop Holdings and signed a 15-year licensing agreement. Under the licensing agreement, a &quot;royalty holiday&quot; period existed until October 2006 to allow revamping of the stores. The royalty thereafter was 5% of store sales while online sales give Disney a 9% to 10% royalty. Hoop Holdings had to write off the cost ($48 million) of the equipment and property received in the purchase. On the weekend of March 24, 2005, Hoop Holdings opened its first Disney Store Outlet location.

The Children&#x27;s Place intended to reinvigorate the Disney Store brand in the United States by expanding the number of stores, reducing initial selling prices. Previously, Disney Stores have been well known for inflated initial prices, which would be marked down substantially after just a few weeks. Also, The Children&#x27;s Place opened Disney outlet stores, which have lower operating costs and typically have a high profit margin even though they have reduced prices versus mall stores. However, Disney&#x27;s strict licensing agreement, which included the burden of being required to invest significantly in store remodels, contributed to the eventual decision by The Children&#x27;s Place to exit the business.

Hoops saw progress with its strategy as open stores in 2006 for 11 month saw 15% increase in sales assisted by a better Disney box office results, and the success of the Disney Channel&#x27;s hit made-for-TV movie &quot;High School Musical&quot;. A store website would be up and running in April 2007. Hoops Retail Stores, DBA Disney Store and a subsidiary of The Children&#x27;s Place, commenced a 13-year lease of the Royal Laundry Complex in 2006.

On June 8, 2007, Disney Consumer Products and The Children&#x27;s Place settled a licensing agreement dispute, in which Disney indicated 130 unfixed breaches. The Children&#x27;s Place agreed to have a new prototype store design approved by Disney by the end of June with the prototype to rolled out to 234 existing stores by January 31, 2012, while 18 new prototype store would be opened by early 2009. At the Chicago flagship and about 165 other locations, Hoops would get maintenance up to date by June 30, 2008. Restrictions on Disney to give direct merchandising licenses to other specialty retailers was loosened.

In 2005, DCP has begun working with various Indian retail outlets to establish Disney Corners within the outlets to sell licensed merchandise. On 26 September 2006, the Disney Jeans brand was launched under license to Indus Clothing, who planned to open 30 Disney Jean stores by the end of 2007. In October 2006, DCP licensed the rights to Ravi Jaipuria Corporation for five years to set up 150 Disney Artist brand stores and wholesales under the Disney Artist brand, which sold Disney character-branded greeting cards, stationery, arts, crafts and party products in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Maldives.

===Reunited operations===
Hoop Retail, The Children&#x27;s Place subsidiary operating the Disney Stores, announced on March 20, 2008, that they were in talks to sell the Disney Store brand back to The Walt Disney Company. Hoop Retail filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. On May 1, 2008, 231 Disney Stores in North America once again became the property of Disney, operating under the Disney Consumer Products arm. James Fielding was named president of Disney Stores Worldwide. In Europe at the time, the chain had 107 locations. The San Francisco showcase location was closed in 2008.

Furthermore, Disney announced in November 2009 that they were planning a massive &quot;re-launching&quot; and re-branding of all Disney Store locations, spearheaded by Apple&#x27;s Steve Jobs, who pioneered the Apple Retail Store concept. The new store look and feel was designed by New York-based design firm Pompei A.D. and was referred to as &#x27;Imagination Parks&#x27;, which was under consideration as a new name for the stores. This model was to be high tech and have several interactive activities. $1 million was the expected outlay for converting to this concept. The first of these stores were opened in May 2010 in Long Island, Madrid and Southern California. 40 more of this format were to open in 2011.

With the shuttering of the Disney Parks and Resorts-run World of Disney store in Fifth Avenue New York City in January 2010, a Disney Store replaced it on Broadway and became the flagship store. It opened late in the year capping off a 20-store opening.

The Oriental Land Company announced that it would sell its Japanese Disney Stores back to The Walt Disney Company. Disney took over Retail Networks Co., Ltd., an Oriental Land Company subsidiary owning the Disney Stores in Japan, beginning on March 31, 2010. Ireland&#x27;s first store opened on May 18, 2011.

On September 6, 2012, the first flagship Disney Baby Store opened in Glendale, California. Regular stores were expected to add a Disney Baby section. In November 2013, Disney&#x27;s Soda Fountain and Studio Store replaced DeWar with Ghirardelli Chocolate Company operating the soda fountain half of the shop.

In January 2012, Disney Stores indicated that the company would open 25 to 40 locations in China over the next three years, with the first store originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2012. On October 25, 2013, Disney announced that the first Disney Store in Shanghai, China would open in 2015. On May 20, 2015, this Chinese flagship Disney Store opened.

On September 21, 2012, Disney announced a partnership with JCPenney (JCP) to open a Disney department with in about 520 Penney locations. JCP&#x27;s online version opened on September 6 and the store within a store locations opened on October 4. With the success of these Disney shops and its exclusive merchandise in 2014, Penney added 44 additional stores and add 116 more in 2015 for a total of 620. The JCP locations were also promoting the Disney live action Cinderella film. This actually marked the second time Disney and JCP had team up on promoting a movie, while the first was with the animated movie.

A NY Attorney General inquiry into On-call scheduling in 2016 led Disney Stores to indicate in December that the retailer had dropped the practice early in the year. In the UK, Disney Stores Europe opened nine Pop-up shops in October 2016 for the Christmas season.

Disney Stores reopened in Germany on November 9, 2017, with a single store on Neuhauser Straße in Munich where Disney Germany is headquartered. The store was permanently closed in June 2020. As a promotion for its sleep shop launch in August 2018, Disney Store operated, during the month, a bedtime hotline where Mickey Mouse and friends share a short bedtime message. In mid-November 2018, the Disney Stores USA headquarters moved out of the Royal Laundry Complex in Pasadena to Grand Central Creative Campus, Glendale, California.

With the announced closing of the only store in West Virginia in the Huntington Mall on May 26, 2019, family rallied at the store in an organized &quot;cash-mob&quot; event to save the store. However, &quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; reported that the mall rent was not the issue, but that the chain was systematically closing its stores.

At the D23 Expo in August 2019, Disney announced that it would be partnering with Target to open 25 &quot;shop-within-shops&quot; inside of Targets on October 4.

===Features===
In 2010, Disney started rolling out a themed retail business model and redesign led by Steve Jobs for its stores dubbed Imagination Parks. At the overhauled stores, shopping is more interactive with a large castle that has a mirror in which Disney princesses appear, and projectors have the leaves in the trees changing to Disney characters. The store&#x27;s perimeter is a lined skyline with local landmarks and added Disney themes for the appearance, and the store is the center of &quot;this big, magical world.&quot; Inside there is a pixie dust trail leading throughout the store. Many revamped stores get localized products and design touches. For example, Las Vegas has 35 items including showgirl Minnie and Elvis costumed Stitch.

Also, a daily opening ceremony takes place with music. A Cast Member selects a child to unlock the store by placing a giant key into a giant padlock. This triggers Tinker Bell flying about inside as the darkened store&#x27;s interior gradually increases its lighting as projected pseudo fireworks are set off.

==Mickey&#x27;s Kitchen==
Mickey&#x27;s Kitchen was Disney&#x27;s first attempt at running a chain of restaurants outside of their resorts. The two locations were paired with a Disney Store, and operated from April 21, 1990, to April 1, 1992.

On April 21, 1990, the 50th Disney Store opened at the Montclair Plaza mall (now Montclair Place) located in Montclair, California, along with the first Mickey&#x27;s Kitchen fast food restaurant. 25,000 visitors had shown up, without any promotions. This location was opened as an experiment, with 190 seats taking up out of a total for the paired location. The second location opened on May 31, 1991, at the Woodfield Mall, which was located in Schaumburg, Illinois. It was , when paired with the attached Disney Store.

On April 1, 1992, Disney closed the two Mickey&#x27;s Kitchen locations, as the restaurants were only breaking even. While the concept was well received by customers, the company wanted to focus on expanding the Disney Stores to overseas locations. A few years after the closures of the restaurants, the two Disney Stores they were attached to remained open until the 2021 closure wave. The Woodfield Mall store had relocated and remodeled in the early 2000s, while the Montclair Plaza store retained the original &quot;pink &amp; green&quot; Disney Store design up until its closure in March 2021.

==ESPN Store==
ESPN—The Store was a chain of sports retail stores run by Disney Stores. The store were designed to look like a broadcast center and have interactive kiosks for video games and news.

With Disney purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, ESPN was a key part of the purchase, which Disney chairman/CEO Michael Eisner moving into more brand extensions from biweekly sports magazines, ESPN Grill restaurants, video games and retail stores. On September 16, 1997, Disney Stores opened its first ESPN—The Store at the Glendale Galleria, with sportscaster Dick Vitale providing color. Two additional locations were opened. In September 1999, all three stores in the chain were closed down.

Merchandise in the store consisted the usual branded clothing, collectibles and equipment like binoculars and radio headphones. Collectibles included one of kind collector&#x27;s memorabilia like boxing gloves signed by Muhammad Ali ($350), and jerseys signed by basketball superstars Michael Jordan ($950) and Magic Johnson ($450). Sporting equipment was sold under the X Games name, ESPN&#x27;s brand of &quot;Extreme Games&quot; competitions.

==Online presence==
Online retail at The Walt Disney Company began on November 19, 1996, with the launch of The Disney Store Online. At the time, the business was under the Disney Online business unit.

In 1998, the company purchased Infoseek, and that purchase included Starwave. With that purchase there were now many other online properties under Disney Online including Disney.com, DisneyStore.com, MrShowbiz.com, Family.com, Movies.com, ESPN.com, NFL.com, NASCAR.com, NHL.com, etc. This led to a new business named Buena Vista Internet Group (BVIG) which grouped all internet sites under one business unit. In 1999, the business was changed from BVIG to Go.com and was then spun that off as a tracking stock. Also in 1999 the DisneyStore.com business was moved under a business named Disney Direct Marketing (DDM). DDM was a business entity under the company&#x27;s Disney Consumer Products (DCP) division and ran the Disney Catalog. At the same time all of this was happening, the team that ran the DisneyStore.com site also built and launched ESPNStore.com, NASCARStore.com, DisneyTickets.com and DisneyAuctions.com.

Disney Auctions was created in October 2000 with a partnership between The Walt Disney Company and eBay. Items such as signs and ride vehicles from Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort were commonly sold as well as costume pieces and props from previously released movies from Walt Disney Studios.

In 2001, DDM was moved directly under the control of The Disney Stores business. The sale of The Disney Stores to The Children&#x27;s Place didn&#x27;t include the sale of DDM but did include the sale of the DisneyStore.com domain name, so in 2004 DisneyStore.com was changed to DisneyDirect.com.

In 2006, a complete rebranding was done. Disney Direct Marketing, Inc. was changed to Disney Shopping, Inc. (DSI), the domain was changed from DisneyDirect.com to DisneyShopping.com and the Disney Catalog business was shut down. In fall of 2006, Disney ended their partnership with eBay and moved the Disney Auctions website under its own banner.

In 2008, after the repurchase of the Disney Store business from The Children&#x27;s Place, the domain was changed back to DisneyStore.com. In 2009, DisneyAuctions.com was completely shut down. In 2010, DSI was moved back under the control of the newly reacquired Disney Store business and a complete redesign of the site was launched. Also in 2010, the Disneystore.co.uk site was completely rebuilt on the same platform as the US site. The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment in 2009 and that same year, DisneyAuctions.com was completely shut down and that domain now redirects visitors to DisneyStore.com. In 2011, MarvelStore.com was relaunched using the same technology as the Disney Store website. A new online store for the French market was launched and a new store for the German market was launched.

For a time between 2020-2023, the sites were branded ShopDisney.

A special Disney World vintage apparel line called &quot;YesterEars&quot; was available at the online store for a limited time in August 2016. YesterEars products pay homage to classic park attractions and destinations and is named after the former Downtown Disney Pleasure Island shop. Additional products would be announced in September.

<text>Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is an American publicly traded consumer retail company that sells kitchenware and home furnishings. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States. The company has 625 brick and mortar stores and distributes to more than 60 countries, with brands including Williams Sonoma, Williams Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, PBteen, West Elm, Mark and Graham, and Rejuvenation. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. also operates through eight corresponding websites and a gift registry.

The company is one of the largest e-commerce retailers in the U.S., and one of the biggest multi-channel specialty retailers in the world. In 2019, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was named as a Fortune 500 company for the first time in its history.

==History==

Williams-Sonoma, Inc. had its initial public offering in July 1983. One million shares were offered on the OTC Market at $23 a share. At the end of 1985, the company was generating over $51 million in sales. In September 1986, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. acquired Pottery Barn from Gap. The acquisition included Pottery Barn&#x27;s 27 housewares stores located in California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York for $6 million. The company&#x27;s expansion led to the opening of its first distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1984. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was one of the largest proprietary distributors in the Memphis area with 3.5 million square feet of distribution space.

From 1986 to 1989, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. grew by an average of 12 stores per year, bringing the total locations to over 100 stores in the U.S. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange starting in 1998, while sales reached $1 billion for the first time.

The following year, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. launched its e-commerce websites. The company also launched Pottery Barn Kids, a spin-off of Pottery Barn that specializes in home furnishings for children.

The Pottery Barn brand further expanded with the launch of PBteen in early 2003. Pottery Barn extended its merchandising with the introduction of the Pottery Barn Bed &amp; Bath and Pottery Barn Kids in Manhattan.

By 2009, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. was operating 610 stores with an annual revenue of over $3 billion. In May 2010, Lester retired, and Laura Alber was named CEO of the umbrella organization. Alber joined the company in 1995. She was active in building the Pottery Barn catalog and the development and launch of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen. In November 2011, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Rejuvenation, a manufacturer and direct marketer of light fixtures and hardware with stores in Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles. The company launched a lifestyle brand offering personalized products, Mark and Graham, in November 2012.

Williams Sonoma&#x27;s e-commerce sales were approximately 52 percent of its parent company&#x27;s revenue of the first quarter of 2015.

The West Elm brand was launched in 2002 with the release of a catalog; the following year, the brand opened its first store. Through the West Elm brand, the company launched West Elm Hotels. The joint venture with DDK hospitality management and development company has locations in Detroit, Michigan, Indianapolis, Indiana, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Oakland, California and Savannah, Georgia.

The West Elm brand is active with the Clinton Global Initiative and in 2013 agreed to invest $35 million on hand made goods from U.S. and abroad to sell in its stores over the course of two years. The collaborations were aimed to positively impact over 4,000 artisan workers. Former President Bill Clinton visited a West Elm showroom after the company spent nearly that amount in the first year of the agreement. In 2015, the company made a pledge at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting to expand its Fair Trade Certified product offerings.

As of January 2024, Williams-Sonoma share prices were up over 65% in the previous year, and over four times that in the previous five years. In June 2024, the company announced a two-for-one stock split.

==International presence==




===Canada===
In October 2001, the company opened its first international stores in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores in Yorkville occupied a combined 37,000 square feet of space at the retail podium of the 100 Bloor Street West condominium; these stores closed in 2017 after the landlord substantially raised rents in 2014.
===Latin America===
In 2008, the company opened Pottery Barn and West Elm stores at Plaza Las Americas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, a district of the capital San Juan.

For Mexico, in 2014, El Puerto de Liverpool, which operates two nationwide department store chains (Liverpool) and Suburbia, signed a franchise agreement to operate stores and e-commerce sites for six brands. Brand covered are Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, PB Teen, West Elm. 

===Middle East===

In 2010, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. partnered with M.H. Alshaya Co. to launch Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids franchise operations in the Middle East. The first Williams-Sonoma brand store outside of North America opened in Kuwait in 2012, along with West Elm at The Avenues Mall, the largest shopping center in Kuwait. 

===Europe===
The company opened its first store in the United Kingdom in 2014 with the launch of its West Elm location in London. 

===Asia Pacific===
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. opened four stores (Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, and West Elm) in Australia in 2015 as the first retail locations outside of North America owned and operated by Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

In the same year, the company also opened Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids stores with a franchise partner in the Philippines.

==Brands==
Under the umbrella organization of Williams-Sonoma, Inc., the company&#x27;s brands are:
*Williams Sonoma – upscale products for the kitchen and home
**Williams Sonoma Home – upscale home furnishings
*Pottery Barn – home furnishings
**Pottery Barn Kids – home furnishings for children
**PBteen – home furnishings for young adults
*West Elm – modern furniture and home decor
*Rejuvenation – light fixtures, hardware and home furnishings
*Mark and Graham – monogrammed gifts and accessories
*Green Row – sustainably sourced furnishings

== Controversies ==
In March 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a settlement with Williams-Sonoma, Inc. over false advertising claims where Goldtouch Bakeware products, Rejuvenation-branded products, and Pottery Barn Teen and Pottery Barn Kids-branded upholstered furniture products were falsely advertised as being made in the USA. As part of the settlement with the FTC, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. agreed to stop making false, misleading or unsubstantiated &quot;Made in USA&quot; claims and is required to pay $1 million to the FTC.

In April 2024, the FTC fined the Williams-Sonoma almost $3.2 million for violating the FTC&#x27;s 2020 order to be truthful about whether its products were made in the US, which marked the largest-ever civil penalty in a &quot;Made in USA&quot; case.

<text>Joseph Lane Kirkland (March 12, 1922 – August 14, 1999) was an American labor union leader who served as President of the AFL–CIO from 1979 to 1995.

==Life and career==
Kirkland was born in Camden, South Carolina, the son of Louise Beardsley (Richardson) and Randolph Withers Kirkland. He rose over his career to head the 16-million-member American labor movement.

In 1941, Kirkland entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy, graduated 1942, and became a deck officer on U.S. merchant ships during World War II. After the war, he worked in the Research Department of the AFL. He received a B.S. degree from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

Kirkland married Edith Draper Hollyday in June 1944, with whom he had five daughters.

A year after their divorce in 1972, he married the Prague-born Irena Neumann (1925–2007). An Auschwitz survivor, Neumann had previously been married to film producer Henry T. Weinstein, who had directed Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s final unfinished picture. The couple had been close to Monroe during the last months of her life.

From 1979 to 1995 Kirkland was president of the American Federation of Labor – Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO). During his tenure, union membership in the United States declined precipitously. The unions suffered some of their most serious defeats, including the 1981 air traffic controllers&#x27; strike and the 1985–1986 Hormel strike. He also served on the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated (FPI) board from 1980-1988, representing Labor during FPI&#x27;s growth years. On the international front, Kirkland&#x27;s support of the Solidarity movement in Poland contributed to the decline of communism. According to Michael Szporer in &quot;Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980&quot;, American Unions under the leadership of Lane Kirkland contributed $150,000 shortly after the successful Solidarity Strike, as early as September 1980. At the time, the Carter administration, including its two prominent Polish Americans, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Ed Muskie advised against such aid fearing Soviet reaction. Kirkland boldly took the initiative persuading Zbigniew Brzezinski of the wisdom of supporting the Solidarity movement. In all U.S. union support of Solidarity far exceeded its European counterparts. Solidarity aid was part of Lane Kirkland&#x27;s internationalist vision for the labor movement and the building of the global consensus on human rights. After the changes in Eastern Europe, Kirkland became a mentor for many prominent labor leaders who saw him as a visionary and visited him in his office at the George Meany Center. He befriended Lech Walesa as well as Marian Krzaklewski who replaced Lech Walesa at the helm of Solidarity. Kirkland was awarded posthumously with the highest Polish award, the Order of the White Eagle. The Polish American Freedom Foundation has established a grant in Lane Kirkland&#x27;s honor, and his union, the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, has established the non-profit Captain Richard Phillips-Lane Kirkland Maritime Trust partly in his memory.

His best remembered quotation is:

On November 13, 1989, Kirkland was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bush.

In 1994, Kirkland was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton.
In 1999, Lane Kirkland was awarded the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom.

Lane Kirkland died in Washington, D.C., age 77, from complications of cancer.

<doc id="1089150" wikidata="Q574184" url="?curid=1089150" title="Lu Ban">
<text>Lu Ban (–444BC) was a Chinese architect or master carpenter, structural engineer, and inventor, during the Zhou Dynasty. He is revered as the Chinese Deity (Patron) of builders and contractors.

==Life==
Lu Ban was born in the state of Lu; a few sources claim he was born further to the west, in Dunhuang, to a family of carpenters or artisans during the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou dynasty. His original name was He was also referred to as or Pan. He was supposed to have been an indifferent pupil until his love of learning was kindled by the scholar Zi Xia. He later learned woodworking from Bao Laodong. The great demand for his work supposedly compelled him to invent or improve several carpenter&#x27;s tools—the saw, the square, the planer, the drill, the shovel, and an ink marking tool—to complete his many projects more quickly. His wife was also credited with inventing the umbrella in order to permit him to work in inclement weather.

==Inventions==
According to tradition, he was responsible for several inventions:

* Cloud ladder—a mobile, counterweighted siege ladder.
* Grappling hooks and ram—implements for naval warfare.
* Wooden bird—a non-powered, flying, wooden bird which could stay in the air for three days. It has been suggested to be a prototype of a kite.
*The saw—legend has it that when Lu Ban was grabbing hold of tree trunks in order to climb a steep slope while gathering firewood, his hand was cut by a leaf with spiny texture. He then realized that he could turn the leaf&#x27;s texture into a more efficient tool for tree-cutting, namely the saw.
*The Lu Ban lock— a toy made of six interlocking wooden sticks using mortise techniques. 

Other inventions were also attributed to him, such as a lifting implement to assist with burial, a wooden horse carriage and coachman, a pedal-powered cycle, and other woodworking mentioned in various texts, which thereafter led Lu Ban to be acknowledged as a master craftsman:

* &quot;The Book of Lineages&quot; (&quot;Shiben&quot;), written c. the 3rd century BC.
* &quot;The Tales of the Marvelous&quot; (), by Ren Fang, written c. the 5th century AD.
* &quot;The Records of Origin on Things and Affairs&quot; (), by Gao Cheng, written c. the 11th century.
* &quot;The Origin on Things&quot; (), by Luo Qi, written c. the 15th century.
* &quot;The Treatise of Lu Ban&quot; (), attributed to Lu Ban, written in the 13th, 14th, or 15th century.

==Legacy==
Lu Ban is revered as the god of carpentry and masonry in Chinese folk religion. His personality is assumed by the master carpenter involved in the construction of houses among the Kam people. He is sometimes counted among the Five Kings of the Water Immortals, Taoist water gods invoked by sailors for protection while carrying out journeys.

He is referenced in a number of Chinese idioms. The Chinese equivalent of &quot;teaching one&#x27;s grandmother to suck eggs&quot; is to &quot;brandish one&#x27;s axe at Lu Ban&#x27;s door&quot; (班门弄斧). His cultural companion is the stone worker Wang Er, who lived around the same time.

The Lu Ban Ruler (魯班尺) is used in feng shui practices.

The modern artist Shi Lu has claimed that Lu Ban was an alias of his contemporary Confucius, but this seems dubious.

<text>Walter Lane Smith III (April 29, 1936 – June 13, 2005) was an American actor. His well-known roles included newspaper editor Perry White in the ABC series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, Walter Warner in &quot;Son in Law&quot;, collaborator entrepreneur Nathan Bates in the 1984 NBC television series &quot;V&quot;, Mayor Bates in the film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, Coach Jack Reilly in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;, district attorney Jim Trotter III in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, U.S. Congressman Dick Dodge in &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;, Grantland Rice in &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;, and U.S. President Richard Nixon in &quot;The Final Days&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe award nomination.

==Early life==
Lane Smith was born in 1936 in Memphis, Tennessee. He graduated from the Leelanau School, a boarding school in Glen Arbor, Michigan, and spent one year boarding at the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, before studying at the Actors Studio in the late 1950s and early 1960s along with Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino; he was recognized in their Hall of Fame. Smith served two years in the U.S. Army.

==Career==
After graduating, Smith found steady work in New York theater before making his film debut in &quot;Maidstone&quot; in 1970. During the 1970s, he regularly made appearances in small film roles including &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Network&quot; in 1976. In 1981, Smith appeared in the Sidney Lumet-directed film &quot;Prince of the City&quot;. He also acted on television, notably playing a United States Marine in Vietnam in the television miniseries &quot;A Rumor of War&quot; and in the 1980 Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Trumpet&quot; starring Henry Fonda, José Ferrer and John Houseman. Smith is also credited for playing McMurphy 650 times in the 1971 Off-Broadway revival of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

Smith made a major breakthrough in 1984 with significant roles in &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, &quot;Places in the Heart&quot; and the television series &quot;V&quot;. He also played on &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; in season 8, episode 7, &quot;Science for Sale&quot; as an oncologist searching for a cure to cancer. In 1989, Smith gained recognition for his portrayal of Richard Nixon in the docudrama &quot;The Final Days&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; praised the performance, writing, &quot;[Smith] is such a good Nixon that his despair and sorrow at his predicament become simply overwhelming.&quot; Smith earned a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. He also appeared in the original Broadway stage production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; as James Lingk. He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance.

In 1990, Smith appeared in &quot;Air America&quot; playing a United States Senator, a role for which he was selected based on his resemblance to then-Minority Leader Bob Dole. Two years later, he played a powerful and corrupt United States Congressman opposite Eddie Murphy in &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;, followed by a role as a small-town district attorney opposite Joe Pesci in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, and as Coach Jack Reilly in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. In 1993, Smith played Walter Warner in &quot;Son in Law&quot;. That same year, he was cast as Perry White in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, which he played for four seasons until 1997. In 1994, he portrayed New York Yankees front officeman Ron in &quot;The Scout&quot;, alongside Albert Brooks and Brendan Fraser. In 1998, Smith appeared in a major role as fictional television anchorman Emmett Seaborn in the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. His final film appearance was in &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; (2000).

==Death==
Smith was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, and also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) in April 2004. He died of complications from the disease at home in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on June 13, 2005 at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife, Debbie Benedict Smith, and his son Robert Smith.

<text>In mathematics, the Euler–Tricomi equation is a linear partial differential equation useful in the study of transonic flow. It is named after mathematicians Leonhard Euler and Francesco Giacomo Tricomi.

:formula_1

It is elliptic in the half plane &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0, parabolic at &quot;x&quot; = 0 and hyperbolic in the half plane &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0.
Its characteristics are

:formula_2

which have the integral 

:formula_3

where &quot;C&quot; is a constant of integration. The characteristics thus comprise two families of semicubical parabolas, with cusps on the line &quot;x&quot; = 0, the curves lying on the right hand side of the &quot;y&quot;-axis.

==Particular solutions==

A general expression for particular solutions to the Euler–Tricomi equations is:

:formula_4

where

:formula_5 
:formula_6 
:formula_7 
:formula_8 
:formula_9
These can be linearly combined to form further solutions such as:

for &quot;k = 0&quot;:
:formula_10
for &quot;k = 1&quot;:
:formula_11
etc.
The Euler–Tricomi equation is a limiting form of Chaplygin&#x27;s equation.

<doc id="1089164" wikidata="Q363608" url="?curid=1089164" title="Darren Anderton">
<text>Darren Robert Anderton (born 3 March 1972) is an English former professional footballer and pundit.

As a player, he was a midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City. His twelve-year spell with Spurs yielded 299 league appearances, scoring 34 goals. He won the League Cup with Spurs in 1999, and was then runners-up in the same tournament again in 2002. He also played in the English Football League for Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers before finishing his career with AFC Bournemouth. In his final ever game as a professional player he came off the bench to score the winner with a spectacular volley in a 3–2 win for Bournemouth on 6 December 2008. He was capped 30 times by England, scoring seven goals and being ever present in the squads at UEFA Euro 1996 and 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Since retirement, Anderton has largely worked as a pundit, notably for Canada&#x27;s The Sports Network.

==Club career==
===Portsmouth===
Anderton started his career in the Southampton Tyro League and played for Itchen Saints during a successful period for the side. His potential was evident and he was soon scouted and playing youth football at professional clubs.

Anderton was signed as an apprentice by Portsmouth manager Alan Ball, coming to prominence at 18 when he scored at Anfield in an FA Youth Cup match against Liverpool which ended 2–2. His first team debut came against Cardiff City in the second round of the League Cup in October 1990 as a substitute for youth team colleague Darryl Powell. Anderton made his full league debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 0–0 draw, making 20 appearances in the 1990–91 season. Under new manager Jim Smith, Anderton became a regular in the attacking side of the 1991–92 season, scoring his first club goal in the season opener against Blackburn Rovers. His performances soon drew the attention of bigger clubs and after an impressive FA Cup run, during which he scored in a semi-final clash with Liverpool, he joined Tottenham Hotspur for £1.75 million in 1992.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
After a slow start, Anderton settled at Tottenham, playing as a right winger, forming part of an exciting attacking trio along with Teddy Sheringham and the young Nick Barmby. He turned down a move to Manchester United in the summer of 1995 following an exciting season spent playing with the likes of Jürgen Klinsmann at Tottenham, a decision that he later regretted.

Anderton won the 1998–99 League Cup with Tottenham, and signed a new reported £24,000-a-week contract in March 2000. 

In the summer of 2001, Anderton was heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, but he remained at Tottenham for the 2001–02 season and started in his second League Cup final, which Spurs lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers. 

Despite interest from Leeds United in 2002 and both Portsmouth and West Ham United in 2003, Anderton remained at Tottenham until the summer of 2004. He was keen to remain at the club and was promised a new contract by David Pleat but the club, under the advice of incoming manager Jacques Santini, reneged. In all, he appeared in 364 games for Spurs, scoring 51 goals.

===Birmingham City and Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Birmingham City swooped to sign Anderton on a free transfer for the 2004–05 season. His best moment for the Blues was scoring the winner in the 1–0 victory over Liverpool at Anfield.

Anderton left Birmingham on a free transfer after one year and reunited with his former Tottenham and England coach Glenn Hoddle at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing a one-year deal at the start of the 2005–06 season. He played 24 times for Wolves, scoring once in the league against Sheffield Wednesday. He also scored in a 5–1 win over Chester City in the League Cup. His contract was not renewed at season&#x27;s end.

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 8 September 2006, Anderton joined League One club AFC Bournemouth on a &#x27;pay-as-you-play&#x27; basis, scoring a spectacular 40-yard free kick on his first-team debut against Scunthorpe United. On 10 February 2007, he scored his first career hat-trick against Leyton Orient. Following a pre-season friendly with Portsmouth in July 2007, Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp heaped praise on Anderton, telling the &quot;Bournemouth Daily Echo&quot;: &quot;In the right team and with the right players around him, I honestly think he could still be playing in the Premiership&quot;.

At the start of the 2007–08 season, Anderton was named as Bournemouth&#x27;s club captain by manager Kevin Bond. Anderton spearheaded a survival bid at the end of the season, with the Cherries winning six of the seven last games, but, ultimately, a 1–1 draw with Carlisle on the final day saw Bournemouth relegated to League Two. Bournemouth were deducted 10 points earlier in the season for going into administration and had this not happened they would have finished 15th.

Anderton signed a new one-year contract with Bournemouth at the start of the 2008–09 season which would have taken him past his 37th birthday. However, on 4 December 2008, Anderton announced he would retire on 7 December 2008, one day after his last game for club against Chester City. In his last match, Anderton scored the winning goal with a spectacular volley in the 88th minute after coming on as a substitute in the second half of the game.

==International career==
In March 1994, Anderton was named in Terry Venables&#x27; first squad as England manager and went on to start in the friendly match against Denmark at Wembley Stadium. He scored his first goal for England in his second cap; opening the scoring in a 5–0 friendly win over Greece on 18 May 1994.

In June 1995, Anderton appeared for England at the Umbro Cup mini tournament where he scored the opening goal of a 2–1 win against Japan and a stoppage time equaliser in a 3–3 draw with Sweden.

Despite missing most of the 1995–96 season, first because of hernia surgery and then with a groin injury that kept him out for eight months, Anderton was named in England&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 1996. He scored twice during his first England appearance in 11 months in a pre-tournament friendly against Hungary. He went on to play every match for the England team that reached the semi-finals of the tournament and, in the semi-final against Germany, Anderton came within inches of putting England into the final when his shot hit the post during Golden Goal extra time.

Anderton did not make a single appearance for England during the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers due to injury but was included in England&#x27;s final squad by Glenn Hoddle. He appeared for the first time since Euro 96 in a pre-World Cup friendly against Saudi Arabia, where he started at right wingback as the team drew 0–0.

Anderton was again ever present during the 1998 World Cup and scored a spectacular opening goal in England&#x27;s final Group G match against Colombia.

After missing UEFA Euro 2000 with an Achilles tendon injury, Anderton played in England&#x27;s 1–1 draw away to France in September 2000 and also featured against Italy the following November.

In November 2001, Anderton made his final England appearance in a friendly against Sweden. He was selected in England&#x27;s squad for their next game, a friendly against the Netherlands in February 2002 but withdrew due to injury and was not included in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

One notable statistic about Anderton&#x27;s England career is that his last five caps were given to him by five different managers. These were: vs Czech Republic (18 November 1998) by Glenn Hoddle, vs France (10 February 1999) by Howard Wilkinson, vs France (2 September 2000) by Kevin Keegan, vs Italy (15 November 2000) by Peter Taylor and vs Sweden (10 November 2001) by Sven-Göran Eriksson.

==Personal life==
Renowned as a player of huge potential, Anderton&#x27;s career was constantly frustrated by injury, earning him the nickname &quot;Sicknote&quot;, which was coined by Portsmouth goalkeeper Andy Gosney.

Anderton has worked as the in-studio analyst for Canadian network TSN&#x27;s coverage of Euro 2012.

He now resides in California and states that he has no desire to move into coaching.

<doc id="1089165" wikidata="Q5504082" url="?curid=1089165" title="Robomow">
<text>Robomow (also known as Friendly Robotics) is a manufacturer of robotic lawn mowers. Founded in Even Yehuda, Israel in 1995 by Udi Peless and Shai Abramson, the company provides robotic lawnmowers to the United States and Europe, with prices ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars/Euros. Robomow mowers are rechargeable. Robomow also comes with its own mobile application for remote and interactive control. The company has been mentioned in several magazines including: Design News, Business Wire, Washington Home and Garden and Vanity Fair. In May 2017, MTD Products Inc announced their intent to purchase Friendly Robotics. In July 2017, MTD Products announced the completion of the purchase of Robomow.

== History ==
=== Robotic Lawn Mowers ===
Robomow was originally named ‘Friendly Machines’ with the goal of constructing robots that will, as Udi Peless says in Space Daily, &quot;move in and around the home, doing the mundane tasks that people do not like to do anymore&quot;.

The Robomow Classic model debuted in the GLEE exhibition in Birmingham, UK in 1997 and was the ‘father’ of Friendly Robotics’ official first model. This Classic model was launched for sale in 1998, selling approximately 4000 units between 1998 and 2001.

The company name was changed to Friendly Robotics in 1999.

In 2000, the second generation of robotic mowers arrived: the Robomow ‘RL’ platform. Compared to the Robomow Classic, Robomow RL was more advanced, smaller, lighter and significantly more user-friendly. Further enhancements included the Base Station, enabling users to create a periodic lawn mowing program.

In 2008, the Robomow ‘RM’ product line made its debut as the third generation of robotic lawn mowers. Smaller, lighter and an improved version of the RL line, RM was designed specifically for the smaller lawn, which up until now, had been largely ignored.

In 2011, Robomow introduced its ‘RED’ Robomow line; a younger and slightly lower cost version of the successful RL and RM models. These models were and still are sold at DIY and Consumer Electronics chains, as well as on the Internet.

2013 saw the birth of the Robomow ‘RS’ product line, the fourth generation of robotic mowers.

In 2014, Robomow introduced its fifth generation of robotic mowers: its ‘RC’ models. These mowers were designed for lawns of up to 1200 m2 and are programmable via the Robomow App.

=== Robotic Vacuum Cleaners ===
In 2002, Hoover and Friendly Robotics announced a strategic alliance for developing robotic vacuum cleaners. By 2004, the first model, Friendly Vac RV400, was on the market. Weighing in at 23 pounds, it is the largest robotic cleaner of all times.
However, this line of products was discontinued, and the company now focuses only on robotic lawn mowers.

== Mowing ==
All current Robomow models are able to mow grass inside a specified area by staying within an underground, electrified wire. The wire is installed around the mowing area by hammering it in with pegs just below the surface. Grass soon covers the wire so that it is not visible. Where areas within the specified are not to be mowed, &#x27;islands&#x27; can be created by keeping two strands of the electrified wire together and creating internal areas.

The mowing that Robomow does is directed in accordance with its movement algorithm, which is not straight up and down. Therefore, although no traditional mowing lines can be seen, Robomow covers the entire mowing zone within a few operations. In between mows, the mower&#x27;s batteries are recharged at its docking/charging station which it returns to automatically.

== Robomow models ==
RC/MC: these models have a 28 cm wide blade that fit any lawn of up to 1200m2. 

RS/MS: these models have a 56 cm cutting width supported by two 28 cm blades, which are suitable for any lawn up to 3500m2.

<doc id="1089170" wikidata="Q283778" url="?curid=1089170" title="Michael Keyes">
<text>Michael John Keyes (21 March 1886 – 8 September 1959) was an Irish Labour Party politician and trade unionist. 

He was born on 21 March 1886 at 41 Blackboy Pike, Limerick city, the second son of Michael Keyes, caretaker, and his wife Hannah (née White). After being educated by the Christian Brothers at Sexton Street, Limerick, he began work as a clerk on the Waterford–Limerick railway line and subsequently served an apprenticeship in carpentry in the workshop of the Great Southern and Western Railway where he remained until 1927.

He had also joined the National Union of Railwaymen and was chairman of the Limerick shopmens’ branch (1915–1926). In 1918 he was active in the anti-conscription campaign and the following year was appointed a delegate to the Irish Trades Union Congress in Drogheda. He was president of the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1943, and in February 1945 represented it at the World Federation of Trade Unions in London.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann on his second attempt in 1927 as a Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick constituency. He lost his seat in the second election in 1927 and failed to be elected at the 1932 general election, however, he returned to the Dáil at the 1933 general election.

During the Spanish Civil War he sided with the Irish Christian Front who supported Franco&#x27;s Nationalists over the Republicans.

In 1949 he joined the cabinet of John A. Costello replacing the recently deceased Timothy J. Murphy and serving as Minister for Local Government from 1949 to 1951. During the Mother and Child Scheme controversy he urged the government to accept the Catholic Church in Ireland&#x27;s rebuke of the scheme.

He served in government again between 1954 and 1957, serving as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Keyes fought his last election in 1954 and subsequently retired from the Dáil. He also served as Mayor of Limerick from 1928 to 1930, as did his son Christopher P. Keyes from 1957 to 1958 and his grand nephew, Joe Leddin in 2007.

<doc id="1089172" wikidata="Q5073247" url="?curid=1089172" title="Chaplygin's equation">
<text>In gas dynamics, Chaplygin&#x27;s equation, named after Sergei Alekseevich Chaplygin (1902), is a partial differential equation useful in the study of transonic flow. It is

:formula_1

Here, formula_2 is the speed of sound, determined by the equation of state of the fluid and conservation of energy. For polytropic gases, we have formula_3, where formula_4 is the specific heat ratio and formula_5 is the stagnation enthalpy, in which case the Chaplygin&#x27;s equation reduces to

:formula_6

The Bernoulli equation (see the derivation below) states that maximum velocity occurs when specific enthalpy is at the smallest value possible; one can take the specific enthalpy to be zero corresponding to absolute zero temperature as the reference value, in which case formula_7 is the maximum attainable velocity. The particular integrals of above equation can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions.

==Derivation==
For two-dimensional potential flow, the continuity equation and the Euler equations (in fact, the compressible Bernoulli&#x27;s equation due to irrotationality) in Cartesian coordinates formula_8 involving the variables fluid velocity formula_9, specific enthalpy formula_10 and density formula_11 are

:formula_12

with the equation of state formula_13 acting as third equation. Here formula_14 is the stagnation enthalpy, formula_15 is the magnitude of the velocity vector and formula_16 is the entropy. For isentropic flow, density can be expressed as a function only of enthalpy formula_17, which in turn using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation can be written as formula_18.

Since the flow is irrotational, a velocity potential formula_19 exists and its differential is simply formula_20. Instead of treating formula_21 and formula_22 as dependent variables, we use a coordinate transform such that formula_23 and formula_24 become new dependent variables. Similarly the velocity potential is replaced by a new function (Legendre transformation)

:formula_25

such then its differential is formula_26, therefore

:formula_27

Introducing another coordinate transformation for the independent variables from formula_9 to formula_29 according to the relation formula_30 and formula_31, where formula_32 is the magnitude of the velocity vector and formula_33 is the angle that the velocity vector makes with the formula_34-axis, the dependent variables become

:formula_35

The continuity equation in the new coordinates become

:formula_36

For isentropic flow, formula_37, where formula_38 is the speed of sound. Using the Bernoulli&#x27;s equation we find

:formula_39

where formula_2. Hence, we have

:formula_41

<doc id="1089175" wikidata="Q1610423" url="?curid=1089175" title="Upton, Dorset">
<text>Upton is a town in south-east Dorset, England. Upton is to the east of Holton Heath and Upton Heath, and to the north of the Poole suburb of Hamworthy. It is the second largest town in the Purbeck Hills.

==Geography==
The town is built around a road junction where the Blandford to Hamworthy road crosses the main Poole to Dorchester road. The Poole suburbs of Hamworthy and Turlin Moor adjoin to the south, and Lytchett Minster village lies a short distance to the west.

The town is bounded by several areas of open space. To the north, Upton Heath is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), while, eastwards, Upton Wood and the former estate Upton Country Park separate the town from Holes Bay. To the south, Lytchett Bay is part of Poole Harbour SSSI.

Although mostly residential, Upton features a small industrial estate with businesses including Southernprint.

In 2000, The Upton Clock Tower was built at the Upton Crossroads to celebrate the new millennium and represent the town pride. A dementia care home was opened at the Crossroads in 2015 on the prominent former site of The Greenridge pub opposite Upton Library and Upton Health Centre. It features a pharmacy and a coffee shop.

There are more shops in Moorland Parade, at the top of Moorland Way, where the Lytchett Minster &amp; Upton Town Council offices are located.

Upton has two churches. Upton Methodist Church&#x27;s Wesleyan Chapel was built in 1865, while planning permission for the present St Dunstan&#x27;s church and the adjoining Community Centre was granted in 1991, replacing an older church on the same site.

==Governance==
Upton forms part of the civil parish of Lytchett Minster and Upton, which in turn forms part of the Purbeck local government district of Dorset. It is within the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency of the House of Commons.

=== European Parliament ===
Between 1979 and 2020, Upton was represented in the European Parliament.

From 1979 to 1984, Upton was part of the single member district of Wessex, and represented by Conservative Member of the European Parliament James Spicer.

From 1984 to 1994, Upton was part of the Dorset East and Hampshire West constituency and from 1994 to 1999, Upton was part of the Dorset and East Devon constituency represented by Conservative Bryan Cassidy.

Upton was included in the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament from 1999 to 2020.

==Education==
Upton has two state schools, Upton Infant School and Upton Junior School, which are s for Lytchett Minster School. The Yarrells Preparatory School and Ladybirds Playschool (previously L.U.C.A. Ladybirds) are also based in the town. Upton Methodists Pre-School is based at the Methodist church

==Transport==
Upton lies at the intersection of the A35 and the A350. The town is served by Wilts &amp; Dorset bus routes numbers 8, 9, 10 and 40 and FirstGroup&#x27;s X54 service. Together, these provide links to Hamworthy, Creekmoor, Poole, Wareham, Lytchett Matravers, Swanage and Weymouth.

Hamworthy is the nearest railway station, with twice-hourly trains in each direction on the South West Main Line between London Waterloo and Weymouth. Poole station, while more distant, provides more frequent services.

<doc id="1089178" wikidata="Q5514028" url="?curid=1089178" title="GNU Radio">
<text>GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal processing systems. It can be used with external radio frequency (RF) hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic, and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

==Overview==

The GNU Radio software provides the framework and tools to build and run software radio or just general signal-processing applications. The GNU Radio applications themselves are generally known as &quot;flowgraphs&quot;, which are a series of signal processing blocks connected together, thus describing a data flow.

As with all software-defined radio systems, reconfigurability is a key feature. Instead of using different radios designed for specific but disparate purposes, a single, general-purpose, radio can be used as the radio front-end, and the signal-processing software (here, GNU Radio), handles the processing specific to the radio application.

These flowgraphs can be written in either C++ or Python. The GNU Radio infrastructure is written entirely in C++, and many of the user tools (such as GNU Radio Companion) are written in Python.

GNU Radio is a signal processing package and part of the GNU Project. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), and most of the project code is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation.

==History==

First published in 2001, GNU Radio is an official GNU package. Philanthropist John Gilmore initiated GNU Radio with the funding of $320,000 (US) to Eric Blossom for code creation and project-management duties. One of the first applications was building an ATSC receiver in software.

The GNU Radio software began as a fork of the Pspectra code that was developed by the SpectrumWare project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2004, a complete rewrite of GNU Radio was completed, so today GNU Radio no longer has any original Pspectra code.

Matt Ettus joined the project as one of the first developers, and created the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) to provide a hardware platform for use with the GNU Radio software. In 2004, Matt founded Ettus Research LLC and began selling USRPs that worked with GNU Radio.

In September 2010, Eric Blossom stepped down as Project Lead and was replaced by Tom Rondeau.

Early in the project, the core developers began holding semi-annual &quot;Hackfests&quot;. In 2011, the GNU Radio project began holding a yearly conference, called &quot;GRCon&quot;, which generally has a &quot;Hackfest&quot; on the last day of the conference.

In March 2016, Tom Rondeau stepped down and was replaced by Ben Hilburn as the Project Lead, and Johnathan Corgan, a long-time maintainer, as the Chief Architect.

In January 2018, Johnathan Corgan retired from his role as Chief Architect and was replaced by Marcus Müller.

In September 2020, GNU Radio became part of the SETI Institute (a non-profit, multi-disciplinary research and education organization) for all financial and contractual purposes.

In October 2020, Ben Hilburn and the project officers at the time voted to reorganize the GNU Radio Project&#x27;s leadership, forming a General Assembly with a set of by-laws that regulate details of how the organization operates. A three-member Board made up of elected General Assembly members took over the roles previously handled by the Project Lead.

== Software ==

=== GNU Radio Companion ===
The GNU Radio Companion is a graphical UI used to develop GNU Radio applications. This is the front-end to the GNU Radio libraries for signal processing. GRC was developed by Josh Blum during his studies at Johns Hopkins University (2006–2007), then distributed as free software for the &quot;October 2009 Hackfest&quot;. Starting with the 3.2.0 release, GRC was officially bundled with the GNU Radio software distribution.

GRC is effectively a Python code-generation tool. When a flowgraph is &quot;compiled&quot; in GRC, it generates Python code that creates the desired graphical user interface (GUI) windows and widgets, and creates and connects the blocks in the flowgraph.

GRC currently supports GUI creation using the Qt toolkit.

=== Plotting and Displays ===
GNU Radio provides many common plotting and data visualization data sinks, including FFT displays, symbol constellation diagrams, and scope displays. These are commonly used both for debugging radio applications and as the user-interface to a final application.

=== PyBOMBS ===
Many users create &quot;out-of-tree modules&quot; for use with GNU Radio. To manage these, and the dependencies required to run GNU Radio, the organization created the PyBOMBS (Python Build Overlay Managed Bundle System) project.

<doc id="1089184" wikidata="Q692124" url="?curid=1089184" title="Arne, Dorset">
<text>Arne is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England, situated east of Wareham. The local travel links are located at Wareham railway station. Bournemouth International Airport is away. The main road through the village is Arne Road connecting Arne to Wareham. The village is situated on the Arne Peninsula, which protrudes into Poole Harbour opposite the town of Poole.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Arne&quot; is first recorded in 1268. It probably derives from the meaning a house or building. Alternatively, it may derive from (dative plural &quot;hærum&quot;) meaning &quot;at the heaps of stones&quot; or &quot;at the tumuli&quot;.

==History==
Evidence of prehistoric human activity within the civil parish consists of 19 barrows and the remains of 4 linear dykes. 
 The most significant of the barrows is the &#x27;King&#x27;s Barrow&#x27; at Stoborough, which probably dates from the Early Bronze Age. The dykes are on Worgret Heath; they are undated but analogy with similar structures elsewhere suggests Romano-British origins. In the Roman period there was also a salt industry of significant size on the shore of Poole Harbour.

Arne village is not recorded in the Domesday Book. The earliest record of the village is from 1285, though the parish church, which consists of a single-cell chancel and nave, dates from around 1200, and has not been substantially altered since, though it was restored in the 19th century and in 1952.

The village was owned by the wealthy Shaftesbury Abbey until its dissolution in 1539, but was never a large village, and by 1894 its population was only 123. A school had been opened in the village in 1832, but the shrinking population forced it to close in 1922.
In medieval times the parish of Arne was much smaller; it covered on the Arne peninsula and adjacent heathland. In the late 19th century it was expanded to include the two parts of Wareham Holy Trinity parish that separately covered Stoborough and Middlebere, and the part of Wareham Lady St Mary parish that covered Worgret, resulting in Arne parish more than doubling in size.

During World War I Holton Heath, three miles north west of Arne in the neighbouring parish of Wareham St Martin, was chosen as the site of the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, a key site for the manufacture of explosives used in military shells. Its isolated location would have mitigated civilian losses should an explosion have occurred, but following the start of World War II, the factory was a clear target for bombing raids by German aircraft. With the main flight path to Holton Heath passing right over Arne, the government created several &quot;Starfish&quot; decoy sites in the village. These consisted of a heavily guarded site containing a network of tar barrels and pipes containing kerosene that could be ignited when needed to give the appearance of a burning factory, thus confusing pilots into bombing empty countryside.

On the night of 3–4 June 1942, the decoy was brought into action and aircraft heavily bombed the decoy site, causing a fire that burned for six weeks. The decoy operation was a success, leaving the Cordite Factory untouched, but Arne was devastated, with over 200 bomb craters counted on the Arne Peninsula. The Germans, on the other hand, were convinced they had heavily damaged the factory and even Lord Haw Haw reported that it had been badly hit. However, the village was left almost uninhabitable and the remaining occupants were given a month&#x27;s notice that Arne was to be abandoned by 10 August.

After the war, the village remained largely derelict until the late 1950s, and in 1966 the Arne Peninsula was put under the protection of the RSPB.

==Geography==

Besides the village and peninsula of Arne, the civil parish includes a significant area to the west of Arne and south and west of Wareham, including the villages of Ridge, Stoborough, Stoborough Green and Worgret, and has an area of .

==Demography==

At the 2011 census, the parish had a population of 1,297.

==Governance==
At the lower tier of local government, Arne is a civil parish which has a parish council of seven members.

At the upper tier, Arne is in the Dorset unitary authority. For elections to Dorset Council, it is part of the Wareham electoral ward. Historically, Arne was in Wareham and Purbeck Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and Purbeck District from 1974 to 2019.

For elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, it is in the Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency.

==Bird reserve==

Arne is well known for the Arne RSPB reserve (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds), which is adjacent to the village. It also lies within the Dorset National Landscape area.

Born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, Curtis began his career at Manchester United and was tipped as a huge star for the future, being part of their FA Youth Cup-winning team in 1995 (when he was still only 16 years old and in his final year of secondary school) and turning professional in 1997.

He proved himself as competent at right-back and centre-back after making his debut against Ipswich Town in the League Cup on 14 October 1997. His Premier League debut followed in a 7–0 home win over Barnsley on 25 October 1997, and he made a further six league appearances in 1997–98 as United finished second in the league, but he managed just five more league appearances before joining Division One promotion chasers Barnsley on loan on 19 November 1999, scoring twice in 28 league games as they qualified for the playoffs but lost 4–2 to Ipswich Town in the final at Wembley Stadium. The two goals he scored during his loan spell at Barnsley were the only goals he scored in his professional career. The first came against United&#x27;s rivals Manchester City, and the other was scored against Port Vale.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Blackburn Rovers manager Graeme Souness was impressed by the young defender, and managed to prise Curtis away from Manchester United during the summer of 2000 for a fee of £1.5 million. During the next season he was a league ever-present as Blackburn were promoted to the Premier League as Division One runners-up. By this time he had also represented England at youth, Under-21 and &#x27;B&#x27; level.

However, his 2001–02 FA Premier League campaign was hampered by the form of new signing Lucas Neill, limiting him to just 10 league appearances. He was an unused substitute in the 2002 Football League Cup Final which Blackburn won. He failed to regain his regular starting place, and spent the second half of the 2002–03 season on loan to Sheffield United. At the end of the season he was released by Blackburn on a free transfer, and was signed by Leicester City (newly promoted to the Premier League) on a two-year contract.

===Leicester &amp; Portsmouth===
Curtis&#x27; spell at Leicester was an unhappy one, and after making just 17 Premier League appearances, he opted for a move to Portsmouth in February 2004, where he teamed up with Harry Redknapp.

After failing to win a regular starting place in the side, at the start of 2004–05 he was loaned to Preston North End. Preston manager Billy Davis was impressed by Curtis and offered him a permanent contract after his impressive loan spell. Upon Curtis&#x27; return to Portsmouth at the end of October, he spoke of his determination to win a regular place in the first team and get his career back on track. However, he made only five appearances under Harry Redknapp, and failed to play at all under Redknapp&#x27;s successor Velimir Zajec. 

===Nottingham Forest===
In January 2005, Curtis moved on a free transfer to Nottingham Forest, initially on a short-term contract before signing a two-year deal at the end of the season. He established himself as Forest&#x27;s first-choice right-back, prompting them to offer to extend his contract by a further two years. However, Curtis rejected the offer when Forest missed out on promotion to the Championship. Shortly afterwards, Forest announced that they would not be re-offering Curtis an improved contract, and that he would therefore be free to leave after 30 June 2007.

===Later career===
Curtis signed for Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer on 30 June 2007. However, after the sacking of John Gregory, Curtis&#x27; first team opportunities dried up and his contract was terminated by QPR in December 2007.

Following a trial with Notts County, Curtis was badly injured and was forced to sit out the first half of the 2008–09 season. He joined Worcester City in January 2009 to gain valuable match fitness after his lengthy lay off, and then signed for Conference National side Wrexham at the end of February. He was reluctant to play in the Conference and turned down the chance of joining Wrexham for the following season. On 28 July, Curtis signed a one-year deal at Northampton Town after impressing manager Stuart Gray during a pre-season trial. He made his league debut in the defeat at Chesterfield. He was released by the club on 12 May 2010 along with five other players.

In May 2010, Curtis joined A-League club Gold Coast United on trial, signing a permanent deal with the club on 16 June. He made his debut in the home defeat against Melbourne Victory.
