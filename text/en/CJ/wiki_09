<text>WBQC-LD (channel 25) is a low-power television station in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, affiliated with the Spanish-language network Telemundo. It is owned by Gray Media alongside Fox affiliate WXIX-TV (channel 19) and 24/7 weather channel WZCD-LD (channel 30). The three stations share studios at 19 Broadcast Plaza on Seventh Street in the Queensgate neighborhood just west of downtown Cincinnati; WBQC-LD&#x27;s transmitter is located on Symmes Street in the Mount Auburn section of the city.

According to its website, WBQC was the first television station to be fully automated. It was also the first station in Cincinnati to perform &quot;digital spot insertion&quot; and to air Spanish-language commercials.

==History==
The station was founded by Elliott Block, who had quit his job with the City of Cincinnati in 1989 to establish a video production and rental business. Block first signed on the air on September 29, 1990. Broadcasting on UHF channel 25, the station had the callsign W25AI but was branded on air as &quot;TV 25&quot;. Its transmitter atop Dollar Bill&#x27;s Saloon in Corryville could reach viewers within a radius. The station originally ran mostly old movies, long-discontinued television series, and informercials via the Star Television Network and music videos from Hit Video USA. Simultaneously, he began planning on a second low-power station, W35BA.

In 1993, W25AI increased its signal to 22,000 watts, expanding its viewing area to include the full Interstate 275 loop. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; began including W25AI in its daily television listings, so that viewers would no longer have to call the station for programming information. The following year, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; also added the station to its Sunday television magazine, &quot;TV WEEK&quot;.

===WB affiliation===
Needing an affiliate in Cincinnati, The WB signed an affiliation agreement with channel 25. On September 9, 1995, W25AI began showing WB programming, rebranding itself on air as &quot;WB Channel 25&quot;. It also changed its call letters to WBQC-LP (&quot;WB Queen City&quot;), after the Federal Communications Commission granted low-power television stations permission to adopt conventional call letters earlier that year.

===UPN affiliation===
In July 1997, the Sinclair Broadcast Group signed an affiliation deal with The WB that resulted in a number of the company&#x27;s UPN affiliates and independent stations switching to The WB. One of the stations included in the deal was WSTR-TV (channel 64). As a result, WBQC lost its network affiliation on November 17, 1997, ahead of WSTR joining The WB in January 1998. UPN struck an affiliation deal to air its programming on NBC affiliate WLWT (channel 5), which aired its weekly then-Monday-to-Wednesday six-hour schedule from 2 to 4 a.m. on early Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings as a secondary affiliation. Meanwhile, as an independent station, WBQC carried NBC programming that WLWT chose not to carry, including various sporting events, as well as series such as &quot;The Profiler&quot; and &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;. After a few months of poor late night ratings on WLWT, and with the addition of Thursday and Friday hours on the horizon the next season that would likely see WLWT refuse lower-rated programming and the network&#x27;s Thursday night film, UPN resumed discussions with WBQC to join the network. On September 26, 1998, WBQC&#x27;s eighth anniversary, UPN agreed to affiliate with the station.

===&quot;Should-carry&quot;===
WBQC had been pushing for carriage on local cable and satellite providers for many years. In 2005, WBQC swapped channel allocations with America One-affiliated sister station WOTH-LP (channel 38). In 2001, WBQC became a Class A television station, with the call sign WBQC-CA, in hopes of receiving must-carry status on cable providers and protection from displacement by the full-power stations&#x27; digital channel allocations. As a Class A station, WBQC had to meet all the requirements of a full-power station. Ultimately, Class A stations did not receive must-carry status, though they did receive protection from displacement. In negotiating with the cable and satellite providers, WBQC claimed &quot;should-carry&quot; status, in the absence of federal must-carry recognition.

Several small satellite master antenna television (SMATV) systems and the Delhi Township cable system carried the small independent station. Meanwhile, talks with InterMedia Cable (Northern Kentucky), Time Warner Cable (Cincinnati), and Adelphia Cable (some suburbs) saw no progress for years. Shortly after WBQC became a UPN affiliate, however, a number of systems began offering WBQC on their lineups:
* DirecTV, Insight Communications (which purchased InterMedia), and Adelphia all added WBQC on channel 25.
* The city of Lebanon, Ohio, began competing with Time Warner with its own municipal cable service. Lebanon Cable, which has since been sold to Cincinnati Bell, carried WBQC on channel 17 (later channel 97).
* SusCom Cable (Indiana) added WBQC on channel 6.

Although Time Warner Cable had long included WBQC on its system in Oxford, Ohio, on channel 13, the station remained off of Time Warner&#x27;s Cincinnati offerings. According to WBQC, some Cincinnati customers were told by Time Warner representatives that the station operated out of Indianapolis, Indiana; Dayton, Ohio; or &quot;some guy&#x27;s basement&quot;. At one point, Time Warner considered carrying WSBK-TV from Boston rather than WBQC (it had used the same strategy to keep Syracuse, New York UPN affiliate WAWA-LP off their systems until an ownership change, though that was more because of WAWA&#x27;s low-quality schedule surrounding UPN programming).

Once UPN acquired &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Time Warner Cable resumed discussions with WBQC. After months of talks, Time Warner agreed to carry WBQC. Unlike the other cable systems, Time Warner Cincinnati would only air WBQC nightly from 6 to 11 p.m. on channel 20, a leased access cable channel. Time Warner later purchased Adelphia, but kept WBQC on the latter&#x27;s lineup until after Time Warner Cable had fully transitioned Adelphia viewers into the Time Warner system.

From the late 1990s until at least 2001, WBQC aired a rebroadcast of WCPO-TV (channel 9)&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast at 7 p.m. Later, WBQC formed a joint broadcast venture with Fox affiliate WXIX-TV (channel 19), allowing WBQC to air that station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast during sporting events, such as Cincinnati Bearcats basketball. WBQC would also air some basketball games produced by WXIX.

On January 1, 2004, WBQC-CA moved from channel 25 to channel 38, switching places with WOTH-LP and rebranding as &quot;UPN38&quot;. On channel 38, WBQC could broadcast a much stronger signal without interfering with stations in Lexington, Kentucky, and Miamisburg, Ohio.

===Independence===
With the shutdown of UPN and The WB in September 2006 and replacement by The CW (which was initially composed primarily of programs from both predecessor networks), there was a question where the network&#x27;s affiliation would land in Cincinnati. WSTR was the WB affiliate and a full-power station; WBQC was the UPN affiliate, a low-power Class A station with full cable carriage (except for Time Warner Cable&#x27;s Cincinnati system). On March 2, 2006, it was announced that WSTR would affiliate with MyNetworkTV. This seemingly opened the door for WBQC to potentially become The CW&#x27;s Cincinnati affiliate, however on April 19 it was confirmed that the network would be carried on digital subchannel 12.2 of Cincinnati&#x27;s CBS affiliate WKRC-TV (channel 12). As a result of the shuffle, WBQC became an independent station upon the dissolution of UPN in September.

By July 4, 2006, in a stunt to promote its &quot;Independence Day&quot;, UPN network programming was moved out of prime time, and was replaced with marathons, and then a schedule of older off-network dramas and comedies. UPN aired early Tuesday to Saturday mornings from 2 to 4 a.m. until its closure. The station then changed its logo, which had some elements of the Ohio state flag. The same year, WBQC moved from Golf Manor to its newly built studios in Roselawn.

With the launch of WKRC&#x27;s &quot;CinCW&quot; digital subchannel, Time Warner Cable dropped WBQC on October 18 to carry WKRC-DT2 full-time on channel 20. The CinCW also replaced WBQC on channel 25 on both Insight Communications and DirecTV, which created some confusion to viewers who thought WBQC was the CinCW. Insight moved WBQC to digital cable channel 189. In 2007, Time Warner Cable Cincinnati experienced a change in management. Early the next year, WBQC and Time Warner Cable started discussions for cable carriage. However, Time Warner Cable stated it did not have any channels available, either on the analog or digital tier.
On November 28, 2008, the station adopted the branding &quot;WKRP-TV&quot;, drawing on the 1970s CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. According to Elliott Block, general manager and chief engineer for the small station, the move was made to promote the station&#x27;s move to digital broadcasting. The change reflected only the branding of the station, as its legal callsign remained WBQC-LD.

In November 2010, Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s local fiber-optic service, FiOptics, began carrying all five of WBQC&#x27;s subchannels on channels 254 and 270 to 273. In January 2011, WBQC replaced its primary subchannel with programming from the Retro Television Network. In 2012, the station switched to Cozi TV.

===Sale to Gray Television; switch to Telemundo===
Block died on November 25, 2019. On September 28, 2022, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase WBQC-LD for $2.5 million. The sale was completed on November 21, making WBQC-LD a sister station to WXIX-TV.

On July 27, 2023, WBQC-LD became a Telemundo affiliate, with Cozi TV and This TV moving to separate subchannels, and getTV ending its run on the station to accommodate an upgrade of WBQC-LD1 to high definition broadcasting.

==Programming==
WBQC currently airs Telemundo network programming. Until 2011, the station produced several local programs, including:
* &quot;New Xtreme Sounds&quot; – music entertainment
* &quot;Scizone with Bill Boshears&quot; – commentary on political and paranormal topics
* &quot;Friday Night Fu&quot; – campy kung fu movies hosted by Cap&#x27;n Dave and the Fu Crew
* &quot;After Midnight&quot; – music talent showcase
* &quot;On the Mark&quot; – call-in talk show hosted by Mark McDonald
* Sunday Mass

<doc id="1081678" wikidata="Q7351403" url="?curid=1081678" title="Robert de Févin">
<text>Robert de Févin (late 15th and early 16th centuries) was a French composer of the Renaissance. He was the brother of Antoine de Févin, a considerably more famous composer at the court of Louis XII of France. Whether he was older or younger than Antoine is not known.

Little is known about his life, except that either he was born in Cambrai or Arras, the birthplace of his brother, and his father was an alderman in Arras in 1474. He held the post of &quot;maître de chapelle&quot; (chorus master) in Cambrai, to the dukes of Savoy, sometime around 1500; he may even have been born there. References to the &quot;brothers Févin&quot; as composers can be found from the time. Robert may have died before about 1518, as evidenced by a memorial note written on a copy of his &quot;Missa la sol mi fa re&quot;, which was probably copied around that year.

He wrote masses, motets and lamentations, though little of his work has survived. Three masses, a four-voice credo from a mass (the rest of which has been lost), two settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, one five-voice Marian antiphon (&quot;Alma Redemptoris mater&quot;), and the music of a six-voice motet (with the text absent) are all that survives of his work. Stylistically it is similar enough to his brother Antoine&#x27;s music that several of Robert&#x27;s pieces have been misattributed to Antoine. Robert evidently emulated the style of Josquin, copying not only the smooth polyphony of the more famous composer but basing two of his masses directly on works by him.

Some of Févin&#x27;s music can be found in the &quot;Medici Codex&quot; of 1518.

<doc id="1081683" wikidata="Q5083132" url="?curid=1081683" title="Charles Vernon Gridley">
<text>Charles Vernon Gridley (24 November 1844 – 5 June 1898) was a captain in the United States Navy during the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War. 

==Early life==
Gridley descended from Thomas Gridley (1612–1653), who emigrated from England to New England in 1633. He was born to Frank and Ann Eliza (Sholes) Gridley in Logansport, Indiana, on 24 November 1844. His parents moved to Hillsdale, Michigan, when he was three months old.

==Naval career==
===Early life and career===
After attending Hillsdale College, Gridley was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1860. He reported for duty with his class in September 1863, joining the sloop-of-war with the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. He distinguished himself with David Farragut at the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1864.

Gridley was promoted to lieutenant in 1867 and lieutenant commander on March 12, 1868. He was stationed from 1871 to 1875 on the only United States Navy ship based on the Great Lakes at the time, the , at Erie, Pennsylvania. While stationed in Erie, he married Harriet, the daughter of Judge John P. Vincent and had three children. Harriet was also a cousin of Civil War hero Brigadier General Strong Vincent. Gridley was promoted to commander in 1882. He also served a tour as instructor at the Naval Academy and another with the Cruiser Training Squadron.

Gridley was promoted to captain on March 14, 1897, and ordered to the Asiatic squadron and was assigned on July 28, 1897, to the command of the , Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s famous flagship in Yokohama, Japan. 

===Battle of Manila Bay===
During the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May 1898, Gridley commanded the &quot;Olympia&quot; from inside the vessel&#x27;s armored conning tower, an uncomfortably hot station in the Philippine sun. Dewey gave his famous command, &quot;You may fire when you are ready, Gridley&quot;. At the conclusion of the battle, Gridley was not in a condition to celebrate, suffering from dysentery and what appears to have been liver cancer. The heat and stress of the conning tower further weakened him. Dewey would have relieved him of command had not Gridley protested.

===Last days===
Several weeks later, he was sent home. On May 25, Gridley was to begin his journey home. One crewman recorded the event as follows:

He came up out of his cabin dressed in civilian clothes and was met by the rear admiral Dewey who extended him a most cordial hand. A look of troubled disappointment flitted across the captain&#x27;s brow, but vanished when he stepped to the head of the gangway and, looking, over saw, not the launch, but a twelve-oared cutter manned entirely by officers of the &quot;Olympia&quot;. There were men in the boat who had not pulled a stroke for a quarter of a century. Old Glory was at the stern and a captain&#x27;s silken coach-whip at the bow; and when Captain Gridley, beloved alike by officers and men, entered the boat, it was up oars, and all that, just as though they were common sailors who were to row him over to the &quot;Zafiro.&quot; When he sat down upon the handsome boat-cloth that was spread for him, he bowed his head, and his hands hid his face as First-Lieutenant Reese, acting coxswain, ordered, &#x27;Shove off; out oars; give away!&#x27; Later in the day the lookout on the bridge reported, &#x27; &quot;Zafiro&quot; under way sir,&#x27; and the deck officer passed on the word until a little twitter from Pat Murray&#x27;s pipe brought all the other bo&#x27;s&#x27;ns around him, and in concert they sang out, &#x27;Stand by to man the rigging!&#x27; Not the &quot;Olympia&quot; alone, but every other ship in the squadron dressed and manned, and the last we ever saw of our dear captain he was sitting on a chair out on the &quot;Zafiro&quot; quarter-deck, apparently listening to the [&quot;Olympia&#x27;s&quot;] old band play.
Gridley was physically spent, and his health began to sink even faster once he was finally released from the strain of command. He was transferred from the &quot;Zafiro&quot; to the commercial steamer &quot;Coptic&quot; on May 27, but he had to be taken aboard on a stretcher. He knew that his condition was grave and wrote simply, &quot;I think I am done for it, personally.&quot;

===Death and burial===
Aboard the &quot;Coptic&quot;, on June 5, 1898, Gridley died while the vessel was in Kobe, Japan.

His body was cremated and sent home. Services were held in Erie, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Cathedral of St. Paul. He was buried in Erie&#x27;s Lakeside Cemetery. A cenotaph was erected in his memory at Oak Grove Cemetery in Hillsdale, Michigan. Findagrave Memorial for Gridley&#x27;s cenotaph in Hillsdale, Michigan. 

Gridley was a member of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==Legacy==

Four ships in the United States Navy have been named for him.

A monument to Gridley was erected in Erie and placed in the center of a city park, which was named Gridley Park. The engraved plaque affixed to the monument is made of a metal panel retrieved from the .The USS Olympia is at Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia

A seashell is depicted on the coat-of-arms of Gridley&#x27;s original alma mater, Hillsdale College, in honor of his heroism at the Battle of Manila Bay.

<text>The Camden railway line is a closed railway line between Campbelltown and Camden in the southwestern outskirts of Sydney, Australia. The passenger service was also known as the &#x27;Camden Tram&#x27; and affectionately as &#x27;Pansy&#x27;.

==History==
The Camden railway line was designed as a light railway and construction of the line started in 1881. The line opened on 10 March 1882 and ran between Campbelltown and Camden. The line was originally operated with Baldwin Steam Tram Motors, but these proved unsatisfactory. The NSWGR purchased two small 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotives from Manning Wardle, which were a standard K Class design. These became the S-292 class. The line carried freight and passengers but was rarely busy. From 1901, the line was upgraded to railway standard and typically operated by an E class (later Z20 class locomotive in the 1924 reclassification of locomotives) 2-6-4 side-tank locomotives. Starting in the 1950s, the usual locomotive power on the Camden Branch Line was provided by C30 class locomotives. Passenger trains in the early years used lightweight KA Tramcars which were specially built for the line, but were also used at Yass and . Starting around 1917 the trains typically ran with a CCA type end-platform carriage, usually boosted in capacity by various independent carriages when the occasion demanded.

Due to the steepness of the ruling gradient of 1 in 19 (reported to be the steepest grade used by adhesion locomotives in Australia) between Campbelltown and , there were often multiple attempts made at ascending the grade. Passengers would sometimes have to disembark from the train and walk alongside it, leaving their bags on board. When trains could not successfully ascend the hill, the train would be divided and the second half of train (invariably the part where the passengers were carried) would be left standing on the line until the first half of the train had been stowed at Campbelltown. Such delays on the line were a source of annoyance and inconvenience for passengers. The main source of income for the line was the coal loader at Narellan and the Dairy Farmers Milk Co-operative depot at Camden. The line closed on 1 January 1963.

Traces of the original line&#x27;s route can still be seen along looking up Kirkham Lane from Camden Valley Way, including a wooden bridge along this section towards Narellan. The elevated section as it passed through this low-lying area are visible – the nearby Nepean River would flood the land around this area when it burst its banks. Cuttings through Kenny Hill are also visible from parts of Narellan Road near the Mount Annan Botanical Gardens. Photographs of the line are on display in the Camden Historic Society Museum in Camden.

The song &#x27;The Camden Tram&#x27; by Buddy Williams, which is featured in the repertoire of the Camden Community Band, commemorates the train.

==Stations and route==
== Special working ==
Every year, on Good Friday, three or four special trains were run from Sydney to Maryfields, to cater for public attendance to the Via Crucis religious ceremony held on the grounds of the Franciscan Brothers monastery near Campbelltown. This required &quot;out-of-the-ordinary&quot; working over the branch line, which also included the provision of an additional locomotive at both the front and rear of each train. The station at Maryfields had a platform suitable for an 8 or 9-car train and was located opposite the entrance to the monastery.

<doc id="1081685" wikidata="Q12403222" url="?curid=1081685" title="List of system quality attributes">
<text>Within systems engineering, quality attributes are realized non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system. These are sometimes named architecture characteristics, or &quot;ilities&quot; after the suffix many of the words share. They are usually architecturally significant requirements that require architects&#x27; attention.

In software architecture, these attributed are known as &quot;architectural characteristic&quot; or non-functional requirements. Note that it&#x27;s software architects&#x27; responsibility to match these attributes with business requirements and user requirements. Note that synchronous communication between software architectural components, entangles them and they must share the same architectural characteristics. 

==Quality attributes==
Notable quality attributes include:
* accessibility
* accuracy
* adaptability
* 
* agility 
* autonomy
* availability
* composability
* 
* convenience
* correctness
* credibility
* 
* 
* dependability 
* discoverability
* durability
* effectiveness
* elasticity
* evolvability
* extensibility
* failure transparency
* familiarity
* fault-tolerance
* fidelity
* flexibility
* 
* integrity
* interactivity
* interchangeability
* interoperability
* intuitiveness
* learnability
* localizability
* maintainability
* 
* modularity
* observability
* operability
* orthogonality
* portability
* precision
* predictability
* process capabilities
* 
* redundancy
* relevance
* reliability
* repairability
* repeatability
* reproducibility
* resilience
* responsiveness
* reusability
* robustness
* safety
* scalability
* self-sustainability
* serviceability (a.k.a. supportability)
* simplicity
* stability
* standards compliance
* survivability
* sustainability
* testability
* timeliness
* traceability
* transparency
* understandability
* usability
* vulnerability

Many of these quality attributes can also be applied to data quality.

== Common subsets ==
* Together, reliability, availability, serviceability, usability and installability, are referred to as RASUI.
* Functionality, usability, reliability, performance and supportability are together referred to as FURPS in relation to software requirements.
* Agility in working software is an aggregation of seven architecturally sensitive attributes: debuggability, extensibility, portability, scalability, securability, testability and understandability.
* For databases reliability, availability, scalability and recoverability (RASR), is an important concept.
* Atomicity, consistency, isolation (sometimes integrity), durability (ACID) is a transaction metric.
* When dealing with safety-critical systems, the acronym reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) is frequently used.
* Dependability is an aggregate of availability, reliability, safety, integrity and maintainability.
** Integrity depends on security and survivability.
** Security is a composite of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Security and dependability are often treated together.

<text>The Luberon ( or ; Provençal: &quot;Leberon&quot; or &quot;Leberoun&quot; ) is a massif in central Provence in Southern France, part of the French Prealps. It has a maximum elevation of and an area of about . It is composed of three mountain ranges (from west to east): Lesser Luberon (&quot;Petit Luberon&quot;), Greater Luberon (&quot;Grand Luberon&quot;) and Eastern Luberon (&quot;Luberon oriental&quot;). The valleys north and south of them contain a number of towns and villages as well as agricultural land; the northern part is marked by the Calavon, while the southern part is characterised by the Durance.

The Luberon is often advertised under the name Lubéron (with an acute accent on top of the &quot;e&quot;); some dictionaries justify that the two spellings are interchangeable. The total number of inhabitants varies greatly between winter and summer, due to a massive influx of tourists during the warm season. It is a favourite destination for French high society and British and American visitors because of the pleasant and picturesque towns and villages, comfortable way of life, agricultural wealth, historical and cultural associations, as well as hiking trails. Samuel Beckett notably lived in Cave Bonelly, a vineyard near to Roussillon, during World War II. 

In the last two decades the Luberon has become known in the English-speaking world especially through a series of books by British author Peter Mayle chronicling his life as an expatriate settled in the Luberon village of Ménerbes. These are titled &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;, &quot;Toujours Provence&quot; and &quot;Encore Provence&quot;. Another of Mayle&#x27;s books, a novel set in the Luberon, was made into a film called &quot;A Good Year&quot; (2006) directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and filmed in the region.

==Flora and fauna==
Luberon is particularly rich in biological diversity. There are known to be around 1,500 species of plants, accounting for 30% of the flora and fauna in France, 17,000 species and sub-species of insects with almost 2,300 species of Lepidoptera, or nearly 40% of species living in France, 341 species and subspecies of vertebrate wildlife, 135 species of birds and 21 species of bats or 70% of species present in France. Among the 1,500 different species of plants, there are 700 species and sub-species of higher plants and 200 species of lichens. Rich fossil deposits are also preserved here, documenting for example ancient species related to songbirds, as well as an ancestral pelican.

==Nuclear facilities==
The &quot;Force de frappe&quot; or French strategic nuclear arsenal used to be located on the Plateau d&#x27;Albion before being dismantled in the late 1980s. Now, the underground site where the missile controls were located is a public multidisciplinary laboratory of the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, the Low Noise Underground Laboratory (LSBB) of Rustrel, Pays d&#x27;Apt.

<text>Vipsania Agrippina (; unknown – 20 AD) was the first wife of the Emperor Tiberius. She was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Attica, thus being a granddaughter of Titus Pomponius Atticus, the best friend of Cicero.

==Biography==
She was betrothed by Augustus and her father to Tiberius, the stepson of Augustus, before her first birthday. They were married around 19 BC. Their son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born in 14 BC.

Despite Vipsania and Tiberius enjoying a happy marriage, Augustus ordered the two to divorce after the death of Vipsania&#x27;s father, who was married to Augustus&#x27;s daughter Julia the Elder. Even though Tiberius wished to remain with Vipsania and held disdain for Julia for her purported unfaithfulness, Augustus engaged him to Julia in order to link Tiberius&#x27;s growing power to the Julian family. At the time of their divorce, Vipsania was pregnant with a second child, who did not survive.

Tiberius divorced Vipsania against his will in 11 BC (&quot;non sine magno angore animi&quot; [&quot;not without great mental anguish&quot;], according to Suetonius) and never ceased to rue his action. On one occasion Tiberius caught sight of Vipsania and followed her with an intent and tearful gaze. Precautions were taken to avoid further embarrassing meetings with her.

In 11 BC she married Gaius Asinius Gallus, a Senator and son of the famous orator Gaius Asinius Pollio. They had at least six sons and maybe one or more daughters. Vipsania Agrippina died in AD 20, a few days after the ovation of her son Drusus, which took place on 28 May.

Tiberius hated Gallus, not least because Gallus claimed that Drusus was his own son. In 30, at Tiberius&#x27; instigation, the Senate was to declare Gallus a public enemy. He died in prison in 33, of starvation.

== Issue ==
Vipsania and Gallus&#x27; known sons were:

*Gaius Asinius Pollio – Consul in 23; exiled as an accuser of a conspiracy and later was put to death on orders from Empress Valeria Messalina.
*Marcus Asinius Agrippa – Consul in 25 and died in the end of 26. Tacitus describes him as &quot;not unworthy of his ancestors&quot;. His son Marcus Asinius Marcellus was Consul in 54, at the time when the Emperor Claudius died.
*Asinius Saloninus (possibly &quot;Gnaeus&quot; Asinius Saloninus, sometimes wrongly called &quot;Salonius&quot;) – died in 22. Tacitus describes him as an ‘eminent’ person. Saloninus was intended to marry one of the granddaughters of Emperor Tiberius.
*Servius Asinius Celer – was &quot;consul suffectus&quot; in 38. From Emperor Caligula he purchased a fish at an enormous price. He is mentioned in the satire, by Seneca, &quot;The Pumpkinification of Claudius&quot;, where he is listed among the many people killed by that emperor; his death probably occurred sometime before mid-47. Asinius Celer seems to have had a daughter by the name of Asinia Agrippina, though her existence is obscure.
*Asinius Gallus (possibly &quot;Lucius&quot; Asinius Gallus, sometimes wrongly called &quot;Gallo&quot;) – in 46 he conspired against Claudius and was forced to go into exile. Cassius Dio describes him as being &quot;very small and ugly&quot;. Later rehabilitated, he became Consul in 62.
*Gnaeus Asinius – his existence is recorded by the townsfolk of Puteoli, whose patron he was. Nothing else is known about him. It has been proposed that he have been identical with &quot;Asinius Saloninus&quot; or the foregoing &quot;Asinius Gallus&quot; but since &quot;Asinius Gallus&quot; seems to have been &quot;Lucius Asinius Gallus&quot; who became a Consul in 60, by exclusion of parts &quot;Gnaeus Asinius&quot; may be the &quot;Asinius Saloninus&quot;.
* Besides their sons Vipsania and Gallus likely had at least one daughter, but possibly more. Pomponia Graecina was a distinguished lady married to Aulus Plautius, and appears to have been a daughter of a daughter of Vipsania. Plautius was a general in the conquest of Britain, which he received as a military ovation. Nero murdered their son, reportedly because Agrippina the Younger, mother of Nero, was in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne.

Tacitus states that Vipsania was the only one of Agrippa&#x27;s children to die a natural death. She was one of the leading women of her time; and between 21 and 23, her son Drusus honored her memory with statues, coins and inscriptions.

== Cultural depictions ==
Robert Graves&#x27; novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; mentions Tiberius following Vipsania with his eyes after their divorce, referencing Suetonius (&quot;Lives of the Twelve Caesars&quot;, Tiberius, 7).

The television adaptation went somewhat further, the second episode included a fairly lengthy scene between Tiberius and Vipsania on the eve of her second marriage, with Tiberius upset and regretting their divorce. She was played by Sheila Ruskin.

Deadline announced in December 2022 that Vipsania would be depicted once more on television screens as part of Sky and MGM+’s second season of &quot;Domina&quot;, played by actress Joelle.

<doc id="1081722" wikidata="Q3410524" url="?curid=1081722" title="Puck (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Puck is the codename of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The two characters are a father and daughter pair, who are both members of Alpha Flight, in the Marvel Universe.

==Publication history==
The first Puck debuted in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; #1 (Aug 1983) and was created by John Byrne. He had intended for the original Puck to be a dwarf with no superhuman powers, merely great fighting and acrobatic skills; subsequent writer Bill Mantlo retconned Puck&#x27;s small stature as being due to mystical influences. Byrne commented on this, stating, &quot;Of course, [Mantlo] then went on to do the &#x27;origin&#x27; of Puck, with the whole &#x27;demon inside&#x27; thing being based, apparently, on the single reference Puck had made to being in constant pain, something which Bill failed to grasp was an effect of the condition — achondroplasty, called by name in the same issue that referenced the pain — which caused Puck&#x27;s dwarfism.&quot; Byrne has also stated that Puck was based &quot;very, very loosely on a friend who was short (but not as short as Puck) and occasionally bald, but never possessed by demons.&quot;

The second Puck debuted in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; vol. 3 #1 and was created by Scott Lobdell and Clayton Henry.

==Fictional character biography==

===Puck (Eugene Judd)===

The first character to use the codename is a man whose real name is Eugene Milton Judd. He was born in 1914 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He spent years traveling the world as a soldier of fortune, working as an intelligence agent and bouncer, before becoming a professional adventurer and joining Alpha Flight.

Early in his career, Judd was hired to steal the Black Blade of Baghdad. The Blade imprisoned an ancient sorcerer called Black Raazer, and Judd accidentally freed him. Judd was able to trap Raazer using some ancient mysticism and the light from his own life force. This caused the 6&#x27;6&quot; tall adventurer to shrink to about 3&#x27;6&quot; in height, as the Black Blade had the ability to take life force from others, which caused a physical reduction in size. It has also granted him immortality. At some point, he became friends with the American playboy Dan Kane, otherwise known as Captain Terror. When Captain Terror was defeated in the Spanish Civil War by the 1930s El Aguila, a fellow hero fighting on the opposite side, he retired, but Puck fought El Aguila for revenge. He also formed a friendship with noted author Ernest Hemingway and became an accomplished bullfighter. He was paroled into Beta Flight and, eventually joining Alpha Flight, he adopted the codename &quot;Puck.&quot;

Some details of his past remain unknown, hinted at in dialogue: the affair of the Brass Bishop, and some murders.

Puck was seriously wounded by teammate Marrina, made temporarily bestial under a summoning call sent by the Master of the World and hospitalized. While recovering, he battled an illegal drug ring that was operating out of the hospital. Before long, he returned to active duty, and battled Omega Flight. Puck comforted Heather Hudson after James Hudson&#x27;s presumed death. Puck then encountered the Sub-Mariner, and allied with the Sub-Mariner in battle against the Master.

Puck later journeyed to the realm of the Great Beasts alongside Alpha Flight, where they battled the Great Beasts. Puck encountered the Beyonder, and battled the Hulk during the events of &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;.

During his time with Alpha Flight, he encountered a new city deep in the Arctic Circle. There his team and the X-Men discovered a mystical wellspring. Several humans associated with the X-Men had gained vast powers via the wellspring. Puck was cured of his dwarfism by the well-intentioned Madelyne Pryor. He discovered a problem with walking because his center of balance was off. Later, the group discovered that the powers came at a price too high to bear, such as the loss of all creativity among all affected and the deaths of all mystics. This includes Puck&#x27;s friend Shaman. The group splits along ideological lines, and both groups battle for some time before turning on the main threat. This turns out to be the trickster god Loki, who was eventually persuaded to remove all effects of the well, which unfortunately included Puck&#x27;s new height. A thought balloon indicated that the pain associated with his dwarfism was now worse than ever.

Soon after, Puck&#x27;s background was revealed, and he battled Black Raazer who temporarily freed himself from the prison of Puck&#x27;s body. He told his teammates about his past, and then took Raazer back into his body once more. He had romantic interest in Heather Hudson, but she instead turned to their teammate Madison Jeffries. Puck later encountered the Avengers.

When Northstar and Aurora both fell deathly ill (him physically and her mentally), Alpha Flight took them to the site of the Firefountain that Loki previously used to grant powers and wishes. Loki led them to a dark fountain instead (emanating from a deep pit), and sent dark elves to attack them. During the resulting fight, Puck is knocked into the fountain. Raazer was freed from Puck&#x27;s body, returning Puck to his normal size and actual age even as he fell to what should have been his death. Loki instead teleported Puck to Tibet, and decided to abandon his previous life. Later, Puck became embroiled in a battle between Tibet and mainland China. He fought the Dreamqueen alongside Alpha Flight and was captured by her as the rest of the team was sent elsewhere. After being tortured by the Dreamqueen for a time, he was rescued by Alpha Flight and taken to the hospital to heal the injuries the Dreamqueen inflicted. Shaman injects Puck with a serum derived from his own blood and the mutative properties of a formula created by the Master. The serum was designed to repair Puck&#x27;s body, but it was from his dwarf state. It reshaped him into his dwarf form and gave him the power to harden his skin to near invulnerability. He rejoined Alpha Flight with his new power.

Later, during the events of the Infinity Crusade, Puck was brainwashed and taken by the cosmic powered villain the Goddess. He was paired up with the affected Spider-Man when an invasion force of free-minded superheroes plan to attack the Goddess&#x27; fortress. This specific pairing was intended to teach Spider-Man brutality in the face of his &#x27;former&#x27; friends. Puck was swiftly taken out of the fight, defeated by Firestar. Due to the effects of the resulting clash, all brainwashed heroes were later freed.

Puck was brainwashed again by members of his own government, who desired to have an Alpha Flight completely under their control. Puck fought with this new team for a while and was one of the few to be relatively successful against the mental mind games.

Along with Major Mapleleaf, Puck II, Vindicator, and Shaman, Puck was among the Alpha Flight members to be apparently killed by The Collective. Only Sasquatch was confirmed to have survived.

When Wolverine has been trapped in Hell by unknown forces, Puck and an unknown person are seen there, with the unknown person claiming to just want to talk to Wolverine, but Puck planning on finding a way to get both Wolverine and himself out of hell. Puck tells Wolverine to fight through the pain he feels while being tortured, implying that it will make the devil look weak and cause an uprising in hell, thus giving them a chance to escape. After the Devil is beaten, Puck attempts to escape along with Wolverine, but falls from the walls of hell which he was scaling when another condemned one grabs his foot and yanks him off and back into the pit. Though he remains in Hell, he wins the scrum for the Devil&#x27;s sword, thus making him the ruler of Hell, at least for the time being.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Puck was shown to have escaped from Hell when he arrives to rescue Guardian from Vindicator (who betrayed the team to Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party, later revealed to be under the control of the Master of the World) and stated that he had escaped from Hell after his fight with Ba&#x27;al.

It has been announced that Puck will be a member of the relaunched &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; team alongside Storm, Psylocke and Spiral.

When Elizabeth Twoyoungmen was introduced to Alpha Flight, Puck became her physics instructor. Much later at the time of a mass Wendigo outbreak, the two have become lovers.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Puck appears as a member of the Alpha Flight space program.

===Puck (Zuzha Yu)===

Zuzha Yu was a mutant who worked at a bar near McGill University in Montreal and was supposedly the daughter of the original Puck. She agreed to join the reformed Alpha Flight after losing an arm-wrestling match with Walter Langkowski, alias Sasquatch.

At the end of the series it shows that she and Major Mapleleaf have children.

She was one of the members of Alpha Flight apparently killed by The Collective.
==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Puck had no superhuman powers, relying on his exceptional training and his amassed worldly knowledge. He was a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, capable of a mixture of various martial arts, street-fighting techniques, acrobatics and gymnastics. After a run-in with The Master of the World his body was subject to genetic manipulation of his cellular structure. His body tissues were condensed at a molecular level, causing his body to become akin to compressed rubber. His trademark attack is a cartwheeling motion. Spinning on his hands and feet at great speeds, he is able to slam into and knock down human-sized enemies with ease. He is also skilled in bullfighting. He has some knowledge of mysticism, enough to once trap Black Raazer, and the ability to put himself in a temporary deathlike trance state. Puck is about half the size of the average man. His condition causes him varying amounts of constant pain. Also, his aging has been stopped or vastly slowed; Judd resembles a man in his thirties. His right ear is misshapen, presumably due to an old injury (see cauliflower ear).

Zuzha had superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, coordination, endurance, and could redirect kinetic energy. She was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.

==Other versions==

===Earth X===
In this alternate future, Puck is seen as one of the many heroes in the afterlife. They all rally to fight the forces of Mephisto and Thanos, in an attempt to stop their genocidal plans.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the Marvel Zombies comics set in the universe of Earth-2149 the zombified Alpha Flight attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by Magneto. Puck is pictured in the foreground of a large panel depicting Alpha Flight attacking the X-Men and Puck is apparently attacking Nightcrawler. Puck is destroyed moments later by Magneto.

===Marvel Noir===
Puck (Eugene Judd) is Captain Logan&#x27;s first mate in X-Men Noir.

<doc id="1081726" wikidata="Q3294357" url="?curid=1081726" title="Zach Thornton">
<text>Zach Thornton (born October 10, 1973) is an American soccer player who is goalkeeping coach for Chicago Fire FC. A goalkeeper, he spent 16 seasons in Major League Soccer with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (1996–97), Chicago Fire (1998–2006), Colorado Rapids (2007), New York Red Bulls (2008) and Chivas USA (2008–11). He was the starting goalkeeper for the Fire when it won MLS Cup &#x27;98 in its inaugural year. He, Chris Armas, and C. J. Brown are the only three Fire players to be a part of all six of the club&#x27;s domestic championships from 1998 through 2006.

==Youth and college==
The youngest of four siblings, Thornton began playing soccer at age five and lacrosse a year later. His father Ernest, who had endured his share of injuries while playing football at Kentucky State College, had gently steered him away from the gridiron sport. Thornton was a three-sport star in soccer, lacrosse and basketball at The John Carroll School. He attended Essex Community College before completing his education at Loyola College in Maryland. At Loyola, he played both soccer and lacrosse, the latter as a third-team All-American. He was named to the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference 40th Anniversary Men&#x27;s Soccer Team on September 1, 2020.

==Playing career==

===Professional===
Thornton was selected in the 7th round (69th overall) by the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. With then-former U.S. national keeper and local star Tony Meola entrenched in Metro nets, Thornton played only six games during his first two seasons in MLS. In 1997, he played a few games on loan with the North Jersey Imperials of the USISL, whose starting goalie was future Metro and U.S. national teamer Tim Howard.

The Chicago Fire took Thornton in the 1997 MLS Expansion Draft, and his career took off. Beating out Mexican international Jorge Campos for the starting job, Zach lead the expansion Fire to that year&#x27;s MLS Cup, and was named the league&#x27;s Goalkeeper of the Year. He spent six years with the Fire, an automatic starter throughout his time there, and frequently at the top of MLS goalkeeping charts. In 2004, Thornton signed a six-month contract with Portuguese club Benfica. He didn&#x27;t get a single first-team match with them, however, and re-signed with the Fire late in the MLS season. Thornton did not get any playing time, as his former backup Henry Ring had taken hold of the position in Thornton&#x27;s absence. In 2005, Thornton reclaimed his spot in the Fire&#x27;s net missing only a few matches due to injury.

Thornton was traded to Colorado Rapids on March 2, 2007, where he was a backup behind Bouna Coundoul during the 2007 season, before he was waived at the end of the year. He was subsequently picked up by New York Red Bulls as the team&#x27;s reserve goalkeeper for 2008 behind Jon Conway.

Thornton was traded to Chivas USA on August 2, 2008. He and enjoyed an impressive first two seasons with the team, ultimately winning the 2009 Goalkeeper of the Year Award.

Thornton was injured during the 2011 season with Chivas USA and lost his starting role. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Thornton was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

===International===
Thornton&#x27;s first cap with the U.S. national team came in 1994 in a friendly against Jamaica. He backed up Kasey Keller at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Thornton wasn&#x27;t able to translate his success in MLS to the international level, collecting only eight caps. On December 22, 2009, Thornton received another call up to play a friendly against Honduras on January 23.

==Coaching career==
Thornton returned to his alma mater as a part-time volunteer goalkeeping coach for the Loyola University Maryland men&#x27;s soccer program on July 5, 2012. He was named to a similar position on a full-time basis for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs at Elizabethtown College just over six weeks later on August 20. He was appointed Associate Head Coach with the Villanova University men&#x27;s soccer program on January 17, 2013. In 2015, Thornton was hired as Goalkeeping Coach for MLS franchise D.C. United. Thornton was named goalkeeping coach for Houston Dynamo on January 13, 2022. Thornton joined Chicago Fire FC as goalkeeping coach in December 2022.

<doc id="1081752" wikidata="Q785580" url="?curid=1081752" title="The Nose (Gogol short story)">
<text>&quot;The Nose&quot; () is an 1836 satirical short story by Nikolai Gogol written during his time living in St. Petersburg. During this time, Gogol&#x27;s works were primarily focused on the grotesque and absurd, with a romantic twist. Written between 1835 and 1836, &quot;The Nose&quot; tells the story of a St. Petersburg official whose nose leaves his face and develops a life of its own. The story was originally published in &quot;The Contemporary&quot;, a literary journal owned by Alexander Pushkin. The use of a nose as the main source of conflict could have been due to Gogol&#x27;s own experience with an oddly shaped nose, which was often the subject of self-deprecating jokes in letters. The use of iconic landmarks in the story, as well as its sheer absurdity, has made &quot;The Nose&quot; an important part of St. Petersburg&#x27;s literary tradition.

&quot;The Nose&quot; is divided into three parts and tells the story of Collegiate Assessor (&quot;Major&quot;) Kovalyov, who wakes up one morning without his nose. He later finds out that his nose has developed a life of its own and has apparently surpassed him by attaining the rank of State Councillor. The short story showcases the obsession with social rank that plagued Russia after Peter the Great introduced the Table of Ranks. By allowing commoners to gain hereditary nobility through service to the state, a huge population was given the chance to move up in social status. This opportunity, however, also gave way to large bureaucracies, in which many of Gogol&#x27;s characters worked.

==Plot==

The story is divided into three parts:

===Part one===
On 25 March, the barber Ivan Yakovlevich finds out that his wife has made bread. During breakfast, he cuts a loaf in half and finds a nose in it. With horror, he recognizes this nose as that of one of his regular customers, Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov (known as &quot;Major Kovalyov&quot;). Ivan&#x27;s wife demands that he remove the nose from her home, so he wraps it up in cloth and attempts to throw it off a bridge into the Neva River. However, he is caught by a police officer, who refuses Ivan&#x27;s attempts to bribe him.

===Part two===
Major Kovalyov awakens to discover that his nose is missing. He grabs a mirror to see his face, finding only a smooth, flat patch of skin in its place. He leaves his home to report the incident to the chief of police. On his way, he sees his nose pretending to be human, dressed in the uniform of a high-ranking official. He chases it, but it refuses to return to his face. Kovalyov becomes distracted by a pretty girl, and while he is not watching, the nose escapes.

Kovalyov attempts to contact the chief of police, but he is not home. He next visits the newspaper office to place an advertisement about the loss of his nose, but he is refused. He then speaks to a police inspector, who also refuses to help. Finally, he returns to his flat, where the police officer who caught Ivan returns the nose (which was apprehended at a coach station, trying to flee the city). Kovalyov&#x27;s joy is cut short when he finds out that he is unable to reattach the nose, even with the help of a doctor.

The next day, Kovalyov writes a letter to Madame Alexandra Grigorievna Podtochina, a woman who wants him to marry her daughter, and accuses her of stealing his nose; he believes that she has placed a curse on him for his fickleness towards her daughter. He writes to ask her to undo the spell, but she is confused by his letter and reiterates her desire to have him marry her daughter. Her reply convinces him that she is innocent. In the city, rumours of the nose&#x27;s activities have spread, and crowds gather in search of it.

===Part three===
On 7 April, Kovalyov wakes up with his nose reattached. He is carefully shaved by the barber and returns to his old habits of shopping and flirting with girls.

==Themes==

=== Olfactory perception ===
Some critics analyze the story literally instead of searching for symbolic significance. A literal interpretation suggests that Gogol&#x27;s story is about the importance of olfactory perception, which is obscured in Western society by a focus on vision and appearance. This interpretation is consistent with Gogol&#x27;s belief that the nose is the most important part of a person&#x27;s anatomy. Major Kovalyov obsesses over his appearance, cleanliness, and rank, behavior that reflects the influence of a vision-oriented Western culture that emphasizes deodorization and hygiene. At the same time, he is deeply upset when he loses his nose, which shows that olfactory sensation is still important despite Western influence.

=== Society and class ===
Society and class played a very important role in determining one&#x27;s life during the time of Gogol. With the introduction of the Table of Ranks by Peter the Great, a wholly new portion of the population was able to move up socially if it worked hard enough. In a society that was obsessed with status, people had to always look their best and prioritize their outside appearance. When Major Kovalyov sees his own nose dressed in the uniform of a higher-ranking official than himself, he is momentarily embarrassed and unable to approach the nose. Even within the context of a ridiculous scenario, feelings of inferiority and jealousy still manage to creep into Major Kovalyov&#x27;s mind.

According to Igor Pilshchikov, the nose disguising itself as an official is a &quot;grotesque hyperbole of Kovalyov&#x27;s petty imposture.&quot; Kovalyov, despite being a civilian official, prefers to be called by the military rank of major. The rank of collegiate assessor occupied the same grade as major in the Table of Ranks, but military ranks were considered higher than civilian ones, and it was prohibited for a civilian official to be addressed by a military title. Near the end of the story, Kovalyov is described as having bought the ribbon for some chivalric order, although he is not a member of any such order.

=== Identity ===
The theme of identity is highlighted by how the nose is both easy and hard to identify at various points in the story. The barber realizes the owner of the nose very quickly when he sees it. However, the nose is able to slip away from Kovalyov by disguising itself as a doctor. This back and forth between the identity of the nose emphasizes how Gogol&#x27;s Petersburg valued outward appearance much more than one&#x27;s true identity. Major Kovalyov is a minor official who acts like he is much higher ranking than he actually is. He refers to women as prostitutes and asks them to come to his apartment. His main objectives in life are to climb the table of ranks and marry well, but without his nose, he can do neither.

=== The supernatural ===
The supernatural also comes into play in this story. The nose is able to transform its size depending on what is needed to further the plot. Sometimes it is portrayed as the size of a common nose, while other times it is portrayed as the same size as a human. This strange ability plays into the absurdity of the story and adds to its comedic tone.

== Style ==
Ivan Yermakov first noted that the story&#x27;s title in Russian (, ) is the reverse of the Russian word for &quot;dream&quot; (, ). As the unreliable narrator himself notes, the story &quot;contains much that is highly implausible&quot;, while an earlier version of the story ended with Kovalyov waking and realizing that the story was indeed a dream. Without the awakening, however, the story becomes a precursor of magical realism, as an unreal element is woven into a realistic narration. Critics also note the abrupt changes in the narrative that appear to them to be pieced together like fragments. The storyline appears to have multiple branches to facilitate the nature of unpredictability as a theme.

Major Kovalyov is a person with many inconsistencies and contradictions. Gogol uses this to highlight the &quot;fractured identity of the main character&quot;. There is a significant imbalance in how Kovalyov views himself and how the outside world perceives him. Rather than focusing on his inner appearance, all of his energy and thought goes towards maintaining his outward appearance. &quot;The collegiate assessor’s private and public faces seem almost unrelated.&quot; This kind of portrayal of an average citizen of Saint Petersburg reflects Gogol&#x27;s position as a transplant to the city, who views the social hierarchy of the city from an outside perspective.

At the end of the story, it appears that Gogol is talking directly to the reader. It is never explained why the nose fell off in the first place, why it could talk, nor why it found itself reattached. By doing this, Gogol plays on the assumptions of readers, who may happily seek absurd stories but at the same time still want an explanation.

== Symbolism ==
In Russia, the nose has been host to a variety of proverbs that range from &quot;torn off&quot; (if it is too curious) to &quot;lifted up&quot; (if you have a high opinion of yourself) to &quot;hung up&quot; (with obvious defeat and failure). By the 19th century, there was extensive literature in Russian prose dedicated to nose references. Critic V.V. Vinogradov believes the nose is not only a symbol of human personality but also a source of comedy and pathos in literature.

Some critics have equated the garbled language between Kovalyov&#x27;s nose and the other characters in the story to mythological consciousness. Due to the situation the characters find themselves in, human qualities are transferred to natural objects and a mythological sense of perception pervades the characters&#x27; thoughts as opposed to the former modern man sense of perception noted for its self-interest consciousness. The story juxtaposes the nose as a symbol of salvation for Major Kovalyov with the nose as a symbol of self-destruction for barber Ivan Yakovlevitch.

Major Kovalyov&#x27;s nose serves as a symbol of his own snobbery and pretentious attitude. Once he loses it, his entire demeanor towards the world changes. His nose acts as the source of his own pride and is what allows him to look down on everyone else. Since his identity is primarily defined by his outward appearance, the loss of his nose represents a loss of his identity, devastating him.

== Inspiration and reception ==
The nose has been seen as a literary theme by Russian authors at least ever since the 1807 translation of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, in which the subject of noses is elaborately dealt with, especially in &quot;Slawkenbergius&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Noses, and even heads, that run about on their own, disappear and then return, or are baked in bread (as in Part I of Gogol&#x27;s story) are to be found in Russian literature of the 1820s and 1830s. Out of these works, Gogol&#x27;s is the most famous because it presents an absurd tale that serves as not only social commentary but also a comedic tale for all ages.

In &quot;A History of Russian Literature&quot;, the critic D. S. Mirsky writes, &quot;&quot;The Nose&quot; is a piece of sheer play, almost sheer nonsense. In it more than anywhere else Gogol displays his extraordinary magic power of making great comic art out of nothing.&quot;

Ever since it was published, &quot;The Nose&quot; has intrigued critics with its absurd story and social commentary. The absurdity creates a certain distance between the author and the reader, which provides an opportunity for readers to enjoy the story&#x27;s comedic aspects, but closer analysis allows readers to see that it is a critique of their everyday lives.

== Saint Petersburg landmarks ==
As a Petersburg tale, &quot;The Nose&quot; has many references to the city of Saint Petersburg, where the action of the story takes place. 

* Voznesensky Avenue: Ivan, the barber, lives on this street.
* Isaakievsky Bridge: Ivan throws the nose into the river Neva from this bridge.
* Sadovaya Street: Major Kovalyov lives on this street.
* Nevsky Prospect: Major Kovalyov takes daily walks down this street.
* Tavrichevsky Gardens: A rumor arises that the nose took to walking in these gardens.
* Gostiny Dvor: Major Kovalyov stops here, happily, after his nose returns to his face.

==Adaptations==
* Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s opera &quot;The Nose&quot;, first performed in 1930, is based on this story.
* A short film based on the story, using pinscreen animation, was made by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker in 1963.
* Another animated short film, made in 1966, directed by Mordicai Gerstein, and narrated by Brother Theodore, shifts the story to Pittsburgh and changes the names (the barber is named Theodore Schneider and the nose-loser is named Nathan Nasspigel).
* Andrei Amalrik&#x27;s 1968 play &quot;Nose! Nose? No-se!&quot;, like Gogol&#x27;s short story, features a Major Kovalyov who wanders around St. Petersburg in search of his nose. The Kovalyov in Amalrik&#x27;s play lives in a Marxist totalitarian society and is excessively concerned about his middle-class status.
* Rolan Bykov directed a TV film adapted from the story in 1977.
* Grammy Award-winning musical brothers Jason and Christophe Beck wrote and composed a musical titled &quot;The Nose of Polton Worth&quot; in 1990 based on this story, performed in Montreal and New Haven.
* A play for radio based on the story was written by UK author Avanti Kumar and first produced and broadcast in Ireland by RTÉ in 1995.
* In April 2002, the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Three Ivans, Two Aunts and an Overcoat&quot; broadcast an adaptation of the story starring Stephen Moore.
* An album in Romanian based on the story was released by Ada Milea and Bogdan Burlăcianu in 2007.
* A play based on the short story was written by Tom Swift and produced by the Performance Corporation in 2008.
* The Fat Git Theatre Company performed their adaptation of the short story in 2011.
* WMSE (91.7 FM in Milwaukee, WI) broadcast an adaptation by Wisconsin Hybrid Theater (Radio WHT) in 2011.
* The Moscow Museum of Erotic Art put on an adaptation based on Vladimir Putin losing his genitalia to coincide with the 2012 presidential election.
* In January 2020, Andrei Khrzhanovsky released the official adaptation of the short story as a stop-motion animated film, &quot;The Nose or the Conspiracy of Mavericks&quot;.

<text>The Westchester County Bee-Line System, branded on the buses in lowercase as the bee-line system, is a bus system serving Westchester County, New York. The system is owned by the county&#x27;s Department of Public Works and Transportation.

==History==
The system was founded on May 1, 1978, by the then Westchester County Department of Transportation to consolidate the bus system with thirteen private bus companies and has been given control over the buses, fare structure, routes, and services. By the 1980s, the bus system had an identity problem in who was providing the service. On May 19, 1987, WCDOT officially named the bus service &quot;The Bee-Line System&quot; with a &#x27;bee-in-flight&#x27; mascot drawn by cartoonist Jack Davis.

The Westchester County Department of Public Works and Transportation currently contracts out to two private bus companies to provide service in Westchester County and the surrounding counties: Yonkers-based Liberty Lines Transit, Inc., the main company that either bought out or obtained franchises from the other twelve bus companies over the years, operates buses on all but three bus routes; and Cortlandt Manor-based P.T.L.A. Enterprise, Inc., a small company that operates buses on routes 16, 18, and 31.

==Scope of service==

Most Bee-Line routes operate seven days a week. There is no service county-wide on two days of the calendar year, Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November), and Christmas (December 25).

===Within Westchester===

The system&#x27;s 64 routes are mostly concentrated in the more urban southern portion of the county, with the cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and Yonkers receiving a high frequency of service. White Plains, the county seat and most centrally located city, is a major transportation hub with many routes converging on the city&#x27;s TransCenter.

Service in the northern portion of Westchester is sparse and is concentrated near slightly populated areas such as Mount Kisco, Ossining, or Peekskill. Areas such as Lewisboro, North Salem, and Pound Ridge receive paratransit service only. During the school year, special bus routes also operate. All but the county&#x27;s smallest, most rural communities have at least rush hour service.

===Outside Westchester===
Because Westchester County borders on the New York City borough of the Bronx, many of the Bee-Line&#x27;s routes operate into the Bronx, offering Westchester residents connections to MTA New York City Transit buses and subways; at least one Bee-Line route connects to each subway route serving the Bronx. The Bee-Line System also operates an express route, the BxM4C from White Plains, Greenburgh, Hartsdale, Scarsdale, and Yonkers along Central Park Avenue to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan (return trips operate on Madison Avenue within Manhattan).

Bee-Line operates mostly closed-door service in the Bronx (local service is not provided solely for travel within the Bronx; appropriate MTA Regional Bus Operations service must be used instead). The only exceptions are:
* Routes 40, 41, 42 and 43, which run along White Plains Road north of the Wakefield – 241st Street subway terminal;
* Route 45, which serves the Pelham Bay Park subway terminal, the Pelham Bay and Split Rock Golf Course, and the Bartow-Pell Mansion;
* Route 54, which runs on Mundy Lane along the Bronx/Mount Vernon border, since no other bus routes travel entirely through these areas;
* Routes 60 and 61, which run along US Route 1 (East Fordham and Boston roads in the Bronx).

In addition, Route 12 briefly enters Greenwich, Connecticut along King Street, in which it makes stops in Greenwich and Rye Brook, New York along the New York/Connecticut border; Route 16 briefly enters Putnam County to serve the Mahopac Village Centre; and Route 77 enters Putnam County to serve the US Route 6 corridor between Mahopac and Carmel.

==Fares==

All fares require exact change or MetroCard. All transfers are free with payment of fare. Dollar bills are not accepted on any Bee-Line System buses.
Bee-Line Bus started accepting MetroCard on April 1, 2007. The fare for the BxM4C went down from $7 to $5. The regular fare was $2 for MetroCard, and $1.75 if paid in cash. Dollar bills, passports, and ticket books were no longer accepted for fare payment after this date. MetroCard Vans made stops on heavily used routes to help people get ready for the MetroCard. On July 23, 2019, it was announced that the Bee-Line bus fare system on all buses would be upgraded to the OMNY fare system in 2021–2022, replacing the MetroCard. The Westchester County Department of Transportation states that &quot;OMNY is targeted for introduction on the Bee-Line Bus System beginning in 2022 at the earliest.&quot; OMNY hasn&#x27;t been installed as of 2023, but is expected to be installed in late 2023 to early 2024. MetroCard will continue to be accepted by New York City Transit subways and buses and Bee-Line service until 2024, enabling Bee-Line passengers to have the option of using MetroCard or OMNY during the transition phase. By 2024, MetroCard will be discontinued and all Bee-Line passengers will then use OMNY. The Reduced-Fare MetroCard Program will also be converted over to OMNY.&quot;

For certain periods during the summer and winter of 2022, the buses were fare-free. As of the summer of 2023, buses are fare free until Labor Day 2023.

==Fleet==

===Active fleet===
This roster only lists buses and shuttle vans used in fixed route service. Paratransit vehicles are not listed. All buses are wheelchair accessible.

===Past fleet===
===Future fleet===
In February 2020, it was announced that Westchester County&#x27;s Bee-Line Bus fleet would be expanding with 78 hybrid-electric 60-foot buses (all delivered by summer 2020), 106 hybrid-electric 40-foot buses and two 40-foot battery-electric buses – all built by New Flyer Industries – under a plan to have the entire transit bus fleet running on either fully electric or diesel-electric hybrid technology by 2025. As of July 2020, 106 40-foot diesel-electric buses and two 40-foot battery-electric are planned to be delivered between 2021 and 2025. Four 35-foot battery-electric buses are also planned to be delivered, totaling 6 battery-electric buses by 2025.

<doc id="1081782" wikidata="Q1800243" url="?curid=1081782" title="Peachtree Road (album)">
<text>Peachtree Road is the twenty-seventh studio album by English musician Elton John, released on 9 November 2004. The album was named after Peachtree Road, the northern part of Peachtree Street in Atlanta, where one of John&#x27;s four homes is located. This is the only album during his long career on which John has sole credit as producer, although on some previous projects he was listed as a co-producer, with Clive Franks (on &quot;A Single Man&quot;, &quot;21 at 33&quot; and parts of &quot;The Fox&quot;), or Greg Penny (on &quot;Duets&quot; and &quot;Made in England&quot;). It was recorded in January 2004.

Despite its generally positive reviews, &quot;Peachtree Road&quot; was one of John&#x27;s lowest-selling contemporary efforts, reaching No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upon its release, yet only managing No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart, making it one of his rare albums to miss the top ten in his homeland. In the US, it was certified gold in December 2004 by the RIAA. It debuted at No. 12 in Denmark in November 2004, its highest chart placing in that country and peaked at No. 11 in Switzerland.

==Background==
In addition to Nigel Olsson playing drums on all tracks, once again a permanent member of John&#x27;s touring and recording Elton John Band, the album features renowned gospel vocalist Adam McKnight, as well as members of Chicago Walter Parazaider, James Pankow and Lee Loughnane contributing horns and brass arrangements. Guy Babylon was credited with playing Hammond organ and Rhodes piano instead of keyboards, which was the case on earlier albums. John Jorgenson, a member of John&#x27;s band from 1995 to 2000, plays pedal steel guitar on &quot;Turn the Lights Out When You Leave&quot;.

The album was dedicated to the memory of Gus and Sheila Dudgeon, John&#x27;s original producer and his wife, who were killed in a car accident in 2002. It was re-released in July 2005 with three bonus tracks from &quot;Billy Elliot the Musical&quot;, as well as a DVD featuring nine tracks from the album performed live in Atlanta. The song &quot;Electricity&quot; from the musical was also released as a single in June 2005. It rose to No. 4 on the UK singles chart.

Some editions of the album included as a bonus two videos for the two first singles (&quot;Answer in the Sky&quot; and &quot;All That I&#x27;m Allowed&quot;). Songs from the album debuted at the Tabernacle in Atlanta in early November. John also performed at the November 2005 Country Music Association Awards, televised live from Madison Square Garden, duetting with Dolly Parton on &quot;Turn the Lights Out When You Leave&quot; and a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;.

==Album cover==
The album art on the front cover is a photograph of a railroad crossing in Pinehurst, Georgia taken by London photographer Sam Taylor-Wood.Taken in by the American South and given complete artistic freedom, she shot thousands of photos during her week-long trip. The trip included other towns like Unadilla and Forsyth in Georgia. While she also visited Peachtree Road in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, she thought it was too busy for the album&#x27;s more mellow nature. She picked several photos to present to him, and John made the final selection. Other photos from the shoot appear on the back of the album cover and in the included CD and SACD booklet.

==Singles==
* &quot;Answer in the Sky&quot; was picked as the first single from the album and was only released in North America, reaching No. 7 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song ended John&#x27;s streak of hitting the Top 10 on that chart as a solo performer. John still charted there, however after this song his singles only reached the Top 20. This song became John&#x27;s most recent single on the AC chart to reach the Top 10 in 17 years until 2021&#x27;s &quot;Cold Heart (Pnau Remix)&quot; featuring Dua Lipa, which peaked at No. 1 (originally No. 5). The music video of the song, directed by David LaChapelle, features professional dancers dancing in different places built on the studio.
* &quot;All That I&#x27;m Allowed&quot;, the first single released outside North America. It reached No. 20 in the UK singles chart and No. 24 on the US Adult Contemporary Chart. The music video features different people in their respective states, emphasizing the message and meaning of this song.
* &quot;Turn the Lights Out When You Leave&quot; was the last single released from the album, it reached No. 32 in the UK singles chart. The music video, directed by Sam Taylor-Wood, was shot outside Los Angeles and features Thomas Jane and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; star Teri Hatcher with John as a piano player in the background, performing this song.

==Track listing==


Notes
* Track 8 was titled &quot;All That I&#x27;m Allowed&quot; on the original 2004 release of the album but was titled &quot;All That I&#x27;m Allowed (I&#x27;m Thankful)&quot; on the 2005 expanded edition.

<doc id="1081783" wikidata="Q1346637" url="?curid=1081783" title="Leave Home">
<text>Leave Home is the second studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones. It was released on January 10, 1977, through Sire Records, with the expanded CD being released through Rhino Entertainment on June 19, 2001. Songs on the album were written immediately after the band&#x27;s first album&#x27;s writing process, which demonstrated the band&#x27;s progression. The album had a higher production value than their debut &quot;Ramones&quot; and featured higher tempos. The front photo was taken by Moshe Brakha and the back cover, which would become the band&#x27;s logo, was designed by Arturo Vega. The album spawned three singles, but only one succeeded in charting. It was also promoted with several tour dates in the United States and Europe.

The songs in &quot;Leave Home&quot; concentrate on various themes, with the musical tones being diverse as well. Some tunes were more pop-oriented, while others, like &quot;Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment&quot; and &quot;Pinhead&quot; were loaded with distorted guitars and had a more punk rock sound. The song &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; was taken off the album because it potentially violated the trademark of the stain-removal product Carbona. The track was replaced with &quot;Babysitter&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; in the United States (prior to its inclusion on &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;); both &quot;Carbona&quot; and &quot;Babysitter&quot; were included on the 2001 expanded edition.

Critical reception for the album was generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing out the fact that it highly resembled the band&#x27;s debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 despite its critical acclaim as well as the band members expecting more commercial success.

== Background ==
The writing and structure are both somewhat more sophisticated than the songs on their previous record. Guitarist Johnny Ramone relates: &quot;We recorded them in the order they were written; we wanted to show a slight progression in song structure.&quot; Most of the songs were written in the band members&#x27; homes, rather than at a studio; &quot;Suzy Is a Headbanger&quot; was written in drummer Tommy Ramone&#x27;s loft apartment. Joey Ramone later recalled:

Recorded October and November 1976 in New York City at Sundragon Studios through Sire Records, &quot;Leave Home&quot; featured increased sound quality through more advanced output methods. Sire set their budget at about $10,000, hiring Tony Bongiovi to produce the album, and Tommy Ramone (credited as T. Erdelyi) to co-produce. More emphasis was placed on the album&#x27;s mixing and engineering than their debut album, which received merely $6,400 to record and produce. With a more fine-tuned and exceptional sound, &quot;Leave Home&quot; also presented a production value superior to other punk rock bands at the time. Author Joe S. Harrington called the band&#x27;s production &quot;brilliant&quot;, and noted that it &quot;put them ahead of the run-of-the-mill garage band.&quot;

The title &quot;Leave Home&quot; refers to the Ramones&#x27; leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was designed by Moshe Brakha, who had worked with the Rolling Stones to yield the &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was a drawing of a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band&#x27;s logo.

=== Carbona controversy ===
The original release included &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; as the fifth track. However, a month before the band released &quot;Leave Home&quot;, Ramones&#x27; manager Danny Fields announced to the band that Carbona was a registered trademark and that their record label had to remove the song from the album&#x27;s track listing. Legs McNeil recalled: &quot;I was shocked. It was such a great song, so radio-friendly—like a song the Beatles or the Rolling Stones would have written if they were just starting out in 1976, with great harmonies and catchy lyrics.&quot; Although early purchasers of the Sire release got an album that included the song, &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; was later replaced by &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot; for the US release, and &quot;Babysitter&quot; for the UK release. In the early ‘90s, after being unavailable for years, the song was bootlegged as a 45 RPM single with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be&quot; as the B-side. The single&#x27;s cover sported a faux Sub Pop Singles design, despite not actually being released by the label. The song was revived on the 2001 Extended Edition of the album, which also included &quot;Babysitter&quot;.

== Promotion ==
There were three singles released from &quot;Leave Home&quot;: &quot;I Remember You&quot;, &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot;, and &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot;. &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; was the only single from &quot;Leave Home&quot; that charted, peaking at thirty-six on the United Kingdom singles chart. The album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot;/&quot;I Can&#x27;t Be&quot;, was released in 1991 as a bootleg. The single was given four out of five stars by AllMusic&#x27;s Matt Whalley, who said that the song &quot;could have been one of the Ramones&#x27; most popular tracks if it was not pulled from the album for legal reasons.&quot; Whalley called the B-side &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be&quot; &quot;simple&quot;, describing it as &quot;in the same vein as &#x27;Carbona Not Glue,&#x27; only shifting focus to relationships.&quot;

After the album came out in February, the band began a four-week tour of the United States starting with Los Angeles. On February 4, the band played at the Nassau Coliseum with Blue Öyster Cult, and played with Suicide the next day at CBGB. A week after this, the band played with Blue Öyster Cult again in Poughkeepsie, to which Johnny relates: &quot;Those arena shows were a little better for us, although we would have more bad experiences in those big places. I never really enjoyed playing them.&quot; The band used their newly designed logo as a backdrop at concerts. They also had more advanced lighting techniques, but still only used white lights.

In April 1977, the band left the United States to begin their tour of Europe. Ramones co-headlined with Talking Heads, who were a new wave band formed in 1975. During a Marseilles gig, the Ramones caused a power outage to a quarter of the city during a sound check. The gig was cancelled when police arrived and dispersed the fans. When their tour manager arranged for a stop at Stonehenge in Wiltshire, Johnny refused to leave the bus, saying he refused to see &quot;a bunch of old rocks&quot;. The band&#x27;s Europe tour came to an end on June 6, 1977.

== Composition ==
&quot;Leave Home&quot; has various lyrical themes throughout its track list. The opening song, &quot;Glad to See You Go&quot;, is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee&#x27;s then-girlfriend Connie, who was well known in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee&#x27;s girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: &quot;Dee [Dee] and I came up with the song &#x27;Glad to See You Go,&#x27; about Connie&#x27;s leaving.&quot; In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. &quot;Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment&quot; utilizes Joey&#x27;s singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a &quot;sing-along mental-illness ode.&quot; The next song, &quot;I Remember You&quot; was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where &quot;Joey&#x27;s voice turns the single word &quot;you&quot; into pure poetry.&quot; &quot;Oh, Oh, I Love Her So&quot; pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda fountain.

&quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; was written as a follow-up to &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; from their debut album. The song was Legs McNeil&#x27;s favorite song from &quot;Leave Home&quot;, who relates: &quot;[The song] was meant to clarify that while glue might not be good for you, the cleaning fluid Carbona was definitely a better high.&quot; The song contemplates around Beach Boys harmonies, and it uses &quot;bouncy&quot; guitar riffs. &quot;Suzy Is a Headbanger&quot; was inspired by the 1947 film noir &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot;, with the lyrics detailing a female involved in the punk rock scene.

The lines &quot;Gabba Gabba Hey&quot; at the end of &quot;Pinhead&quot; were taken from the horror film &quot;Freaks&quot;, which the band saw in Cleveland, Ohio after their gig was cancelled. Joey&#x27;s brother Mickey Leigh said that it was specifically taken from the scene where &quot;the midget groom does a dance on the banquet table and sings &#x27;Gobble gobble, we accept you, one of us&#x27; to his bride.&quot; The song is an audience participation song, and during live performances, Leigh appears on stage holding a sign that bore the text &quot;Gabba Gabba Hey&quot;. &quot;Pinhead&quot;, the album&#x27;s longest piece, leads into &quot;Now I Wanna Be a Good Boy&quot;, which portrays a confused adolescent wanting to be good, yet also yearning to run away from home. The next song on the album, &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot;, was a piece written solely by lead singer Joey Ramone, who states that the concept deals with their record company Sire Records; Tommy used the expression &quot;you gotta swallow your pride&quot; when signing to their record company. &quot;Record World&quot; said of &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; that the Ramones &quot;pack more energy into a two minute song than just about anyone else.&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s Your Game&quot; is one of the band&#x27;s most melodic songs and was called &quot;wistful&quot; by Marcus. It was written by Joey about how he yearns for a girl to be herself instead of something she&#x27;s not.

The album&#x27;s only cover song, &quot;California Sun&quot;, was written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and originally recorded by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure remain the same throughout the piece, Joey&#x27;s pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion as well as a faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: &quot;From the opening bars, &#x27;California Sun&#x27; becomes subject to the Ramones&#x27; distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a blur of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras.&quot; The twelfth track &quot;Commando&quot; has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;, released on the band&#x27;s debut album. He also noted that it has a &quot;bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Kill that Girl&quot;, which was written very early in the band&#x27;s career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a &quot;lovely misogynistic tune.&quot; The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;You Should Never Have Opened That Door&quot;, was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Leave Home&quot; was released on January 10, 1977, and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a favorable review in 1977, saying that it is very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: &quot;The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They&#x27;ve also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they&#x27;re in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an awful lot of people.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; deemed the songs of &quot;Leave Home&quot; &quot;two-minute metal operettas for the Blank Generation.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;People who consider this a one-joke band aren&#x27;t going to change their minds now. People who love the joke for its power, wit, and economy will be happy to hear it twice. Hint: read the lyrics.&quot; The year-end critics&#x27; poll at &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at No. 9 among the top &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1977, with &quot;Sheena&quot; ranked at No. 5 among the year&#x27;s top tracks.

Retrospective reviews have also been positive. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found it very similar to their debut. Though he did consider it to be slightly more pop music oriented, Erlewine writes that despite being &quot;weaker&quot; than its preceding album, &quot;Leave Home&quot; &quot;deliver[s] at breakneck speed and conclude[s] in under a half-hour.&quot; April Long from &quot;NME&quot; especially favored &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot;, calling it &quot;a punk-surf-pop crossover that has never been rivalled.&quot; It was given a favorable review by &quot;PopMatters&quot; editor Adrien Begrand, who called it his favorite Ramones album, saying: &quot;In this album, the Ramones are witty, menacing, goofy, cynical, and head-over-heels in love, all at the same time.&quot; During his extensive review, he called &quot;I Remember You&quot; a &quot;perfect bubblegum pop song&quot;, while saying that &quot;Pinhead&quot; urges &quot;all the freaks of the world to unite as one&quot; with the lines &quot;D-U-M-B / Everyone&#x27;s accusing me.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
The album did not chart as well in the United States as its predecessor, peaking at number 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was, however, the band&#x27;s first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on &quot;Leave Home&quot; were not considered by Mickey Leigh to be &quot;radio–friendly&quot; because &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: &quot;We thought we had a lotta songs that should&#x27;ve been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin&#x27; something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn&#x27;t get played.&quot;

<text>Brimstone is an American television series that aired only one partial season on Fox, during the 1998–99 American television season. It features a dead police detective whose mission, as assigned by the Devil, is to return to Hell 113 souls who have escaped to Earth.

== Plot ==

In 1983, Ezekiel &quot;Zeke&quot; Stone (Peter Horton) was a New York City Police Robbery-Homicide detective whose wife, Rosalyn, was raped. He tracked down and arrested the offender, Gilbert Jax, who was cleared of the charges. Furious, Stone then secretly murdered Jax. Two months later, Stone was killed in an unrelated incident and went to Hell for murdering Jax. Later in the show it was revealed that it was not the killing itself that condemned Stone to Hell, but the fact he took pleasure in it. Stone died the most decorated cop in east NYC history.

In 1998, a breakout from Hell occurs, led by a 4000-year-old Canaanite priestess named Ashur Badaktu. The Devil explains that, over the centuries, a few souls have escaped (and presumably been returned to) Hell, but nothing of this magnitude, which includes 113 souls. Because the Devil is largely powerless on Earth, he makes a deal with Stone: Stone will be returned to Earth to track down these 113 escapees, and if he can return all of them to Hell (before one of them kills him), he will earn a second chance at life on Earth (and thus, possibly, Heaven). The Devil seems to hinder Stone&#x27;s work almost as much as he helps it, however, divulging some information but withholding crucial facts or giving only cryptic clues to where Stone will find an escapee, apparently delighting in watching him become more irritable with his interference. It was suggested by an angel (in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Helluva Life&quot;, played by John Glover in a dual role) that Stone served God&#x27;s purpose as well as the Devil&#x27;s in his former life when he killed his wife&#x27;s rapist.

=== Powers and equipment ===
Both Stone and his quarry have superhuman powers related to the amount of time each individual had spent in Hell. Being deceased, immortal souls, both Stone and the escapees he chases do not display many of the same physical limitations and weaknesses as the living. Throughout the series, they are shown to be unharmed by traditionally fatal encounters with fire or falling from great heights. They do not bleed, nor do they have a heartbeat. The souls cannot be killed, and injuries can only be inflicted to their eyes (it is shown the Devil can alter this rule somewhat, as he did in the episode &quot;Encore&quot;), by the living or dead. Even with the relatively restricted ways in which a soul can be harmed, as told by the Devil, they can only feel pain if it is inflicted by another escaped damned soul.

Each morning the souls (including Stone) wake up in the clothing they were wearing at their time of death. Any material items they had in their pockets when they died continuously regenerate each morning. In Stone&#x27;s case, this means he awakens to find his badge, his fully loaded service pistol, and $36.27—the amount of money he was carrying when he was murdered—on his person. This is a not-so-subtle biblical reference. Ezekiel 36:27 says &quot;And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws&quot; which is a succinct summation of Stone&#x27;s new role. Normally Stone&#x27;s items (gun, badge, etc.) retain no damage from day to day, even if they are hit by bullets. However this rule is inconsistently applied, as he takes his coat to a tailor in &quot;Repentance&quot;, attempting to have it mended on a different day than when the damage occurred.

=== Fighting villains ===

The Devil informs Stone that because the eyes &quot;are windows to the soul&quot;, Stone must pierce the eyes of an escapee to return them to Hell. This rule also applies to Stone himself; however, this was modified by the Devil in a special case when Stone had to return the man who raped his wife. To kill him, Stone had to employ the same rage as he did when he killed the rapist before. If Stone is returned, his mission would be considered a failure; therefore, he would remain in Hell and another person would be chosen to return the fugitive souls. The Devil has taunted Stone by reminding him of this and suggesting that certain escapees would be good replacements. However, in &quot;It&#x27;s a Helluva Life&quot;, an angel hints that the reason Stone was selected is because he was the only soul in Hell suitable for the task and for a second chance at life.

Some escapees have other preternatural powers, such as the ability to control the elements or turn invisible. The Devil explains that the longer one spends in Hell, the more Hell becomes a part of them. Even though Stone himself describes them, literally (in the opening narration) as &quot;the most vile creatures&quot;, some of the escapees seem to be no more evil than Stone himself. He wears the name and pictographs of these 113 souls as tattoos over his body. As each soul is sent back, their corresponding tattoo disappears in a burning fashion, causing Stone considerable pain.

=== Other characters ===

Among Stone&#x27;s allies are Maxine (Lori Petty), the woman who owns the hotel where he stays, and Father Cletus Horn (Albert Hall), a blind priest who eventually learns of Stone&#x27;s mission. Stone occasionally worked with police detectives Ash (Teri Polo) and Fraker (Scott Lawrence). Much of the series&#x27; internal conflict was generated by Stone&#x27;s inability to stay away from his wife, Rosalyn (Stacy Haiduk), who was still alive. Near the end of the season/series, Ash was revealed to be the priestess who engineered the escape from Hell by using her implied romance with the Devil, though he insisted he never loved anyone but God. She also became infatuated with Stone.

== Cast ==

=== Main ===
* Peter Horton as Ezekiel Stone
* John Glover as The Devil

=== Recurring ===
* Lori Petty as Maxine: The front desk clerk of the motel that Stone moves into after relocating to Los Angeles from New York.
* Teri Polo as Detective Sergeant Delilah Ash/Ashur Badaktu: An LAPD officer who takes an interest in Stone, she is eventually revealed to be an ancient Canaanite priestess, and the ringleader of the mass breakout of Hell (implied to have been made successful because she made the Devil fall in love with her). She can control minds, teleport, shapeshift, and summon snakes.
* María Costa as Teresita: A waitress at a diner frequented by Stone.

=== Guest stars ===
* Albert Hall as Father Cletus Horn: A blind Roman Catholic priest who Stone becomes acquainted with while in New York. He later transfers to a new parish in Los Angeles.
* Scott Lawrence as Detective Fraker: Detective Ash&#x27;s partner in the LAPD, he is unaware of Ash&#x27;s true nature, and is annoyed by Stone&#x27;s frequent intrusion into cases.

* Gilbert Jax (William McNamara): A serial rapist who assaulted Rosalyn Stone in 1983, being murdered two months later by her husband, Zeke. To toy with Stone, the Devil makes it so that Stone is unable to destroy Jax&#x27;s eyes without feeling the same amount of rage that he did the first time that he killed Jax. Birds fall dead from the sky in his presence, possibly an inverted reference to the song, &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot;.

* Sally Ann McGee (Alexandra Powers): A vapid party girl and Typhoid carrier, she knowingly exposed hundreds of people to her illness before committing suicide at some point in the 1920s. Her disease, mutated by her time in Hell, is now incurable and instantly fatal, and can even affect other escaped damned souls.

<text>The Oldsmobile V8, also referred to as the Rocket, is a series of engines that was produced by Oldsmobile from 1949 until 1990. The Rocket, along with the 1949 Cadillac V8, were the first post-war OHV crossflow cylinder head V8 engines produced by General Motors. Like all other GM divisions, Olds continued building its own V8 engine family for decades, adopting the corporate Chevrolet 350 small-block and Cadillac Northstar engine only in the 1990s. All Oldsmobile V8s were assembled at plants in Lansing, Michigan while the engine block and cylinder heads were cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations.

All Oldsmobile V8s use a 90° bank angle, and most share a common stroke dimension: for early Rockets, for later Generation 1 engines, and for Generation 2 starting in 1964. The , , , and engines are commonly called small-blocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hot Rod, 3/86, p.54&quot;&gt;&quot;Hot Rod&quot;, 3/86, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; , , and V8s have a higher deck height ( &quot;versus&quot; ) to accommodate a stroke crank to increase displacement. These taller-deck models are commonly called &quot;big-blocks&quot;, and are taller and wider than their &quot;small-block&quot; counterparts.

The Rocket V8 was the subject of many first and lasts in the automotive industry. It was the first mass-produced OHV V8, in 1949.

The factory painted &quot;small-blocks&quot; gold or blue (flat black on the late model ), while &quot;big-blocks&quot; could be red, green, blue, or bronze.

As is the case with all pre-1972 American passenger car engines, published horsepower and torque figures for those years were SAE &quot;Gross,&quot; as opposed to 1972 and later SAE Net ratings (which are indicative of what actual production engines produce in their &quot;as installed&quot; state - with all engine accessories, full air cleaner assembly, and complete production exhaust system in place).

==Northway sourced Oldsmobile Flathead V8 (1916-1923)==
The first Oldsmobile V8 was of a flathead design that was developed by Northway Engine Works before GM assumed operations. It was installed in the Oldsmobile Light Eight and was related to the Cadillac flathead V8 engine. In 1929, Oldsmobile installed a 90 degree monobloc flathead V8 engine in the Viking companion brand before the monobloc was used in LaSalle and Cadillac vehicles from 1929-1931.

==Generation I==

The first generation of Oldsmobile V8s were tall deck big blocks available from 1949-1964. Each engine in this generation is quite similar with the same size block and heads.

===303===

The engine had hydraulic lifters, an oversquare bore:stroke ratio, a counterweighted forged crankshaft, aluminum pistons, floating wristpins, and a dual-plane intake manifold. The 303 was produced from 1949-1953. Bore was and stroke was . Cadillac used a distantly related engine which appeared in three different sizes through to the 1962 model year; though the Oldsmobile and Cadillac motors were not physically related, many lessons learned by one division were incorporated into the other&#x27;s design, and the result were two engines known for their excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy, and smooth, strong, reliable running.

The original Oldsmobile V8 was to have been marketed as &quot;Kettering Power&quot; after chief engineer Charles Kettering, but company policy prohibited the use of his name. Instead, influenced by the Space Race between the United States and the USSR, the legendary Rocket was born, available in Oldsmobile&#x27;s 88, Super 88, and 98 models. The engine proved so popular, the division&#x27;s 88 models were popularly called Rocket 88s.

From 1949 until 1951, the 2-barrel carburetor 303 produced and . Its output of 0.45 hp per cubic inch was 7% better than the 0.42 hp per cubic inch of the popular and widely produced 1949 Ford Flathead V8. 1952 88 and Super 88 V8s used a 4-barrel carburetor for and , while 4-barrel 1953 versions raised compression from 7.5:1 to 8.0:1 for and .

Applications:
*1949–1953 Oldsmobile 88
*1949–1953 Oldsmobile 98
*1952–1953 Oldsmobile Super 88

===324===

The version was produced from 1954 until 1956. Bore was increased to (same as the later 283 Chevy) and stroke remained the same at . Two-barrel carburetion was standard; all high performance 324s came with four-barrel carburetors. The 324 was shared with GMC trucks.

The 1954 88 and Super 88 V8s used an 8.25:1 compression ratio for and , respectively.

The 1955 model upped the compression to 8.5:1 for and in the 88 and and in the Super 88 and 98. For engines built during the first part of 1955, the 324 skirted pistons had a reputation for failing due to the cast aluminum skirt separating from its steel interior brace. This problem did not appear until the engine had over on it. By late 1956, many Olds dealers learned about the problem. Compression was up again in 1956 for and in the 88 and and in the Super 88 and 98.

Applications:
*1954–1956 Oldsmobile 88
*1954–1956 Oldsmobile Super 88
*1954–1956 Oldsmobile 98

===371===
The 371 made its debut in 1957 as standard equipment on all Olds models, and was produced through 1960. Bore was up to and stroke was increased to for . 1959 and 1960 371s used green painted valve covers. 4-barrel models used 9.25:1 compression in 1957 and 10:1 in 1958 for and and and respectively. A 1958 2-barrel version produced and , but had problems with early camshaft failures due to the high preload valve spring forces. Following the Automobile Manufacturer Association ban on factory supported racing, power ratings went down for the 1959 and 1960 88 models: and for 1959 and and for 1960. It was no longer available in cars in 1961.

This engine was used in GMC heavy trucks as the &quot;370&quot; of 232 gross HP at 4200 rpm and torque 355 gross lbs-ft at 2600 rpm from 1957 to 1959. It had hardened valve seats and other features for heavy duty usage.

Applications:
*1957–1960 Oldsmobile 88
*1957–1958 Oldsmobile Super 88
*1957–1958 Oldsmobile 98

====J-2 Golden Rocket====
Introduced in the middle of the 1957 model year, the 1957 and 1958 J-2 Golden Rocket had three two-barrel (twin choke) carburetors with a vacuum-operated linkage. Only the center carburetor was mechanically connected to the throttle pedal, and it was the only one equipped with a choke. When the center carburetor was opened to 60° or more engine vacuum drawn from the windshield wiper pump would simultaneously open the front and rear carburetors. These carburetors did not open progressively; they were either open or closed. The J-2 engine also had a slightly thinner head gasket, raising compression to 10.0:1. It was advertised with gross power and torque ratings of at 4600 rpm and at 2800 rpm. Oldsmobile charged $83 for the J-2 option with the three-speed manual (or in the 98), $314 with the automatic.

In practice, owners who did not regularly drive hard enough to engage the front and rear carburetors experienced problems with the linkage and carburetor throats becoming clogged, and some J-2-equipped cars had the front and rear carburetors removed and blocked off. Moreover, correct tuning was a continual headache. The package was expensive to produce, and Oldsmobile discontinued it after 1958.

===394===
Bore was up to for the largest first-generation Rocket, the . 394s were produced from 1959–1964 and were available on many Olds models. Most 394s used 2-barrel carburetors, but special high-compression 4-barrel versions were available starting in 1961.

Power for the base engine was up to 315 hp (235 kW), even though compression was down a quarter point, to 9.75:1.

The 394 replaced the 371 in Super 88 and 98 cars for 1959 and 1960 and a detuned version was used in the 88 for 1961 and the Dynamic 88 for 1962-1964.

Applications:
*1959–1960 Oldsmobile Super 88, and 
*1959–1960 Oldsmobile 98, and 
*1961 Oldsmobile 88, and 
*1962–1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88, and 
*1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar I, and 

====Sky Rocket====
The 1961 through 1963 Sky Rocket (and 1964 Rocket) was a high-compression, four-barrel engine. The 10:1 compression 1961 model produced and , while the 10.25:1 1962-1964 version upped power to and . A special 1963 10.5:1 version was also produced with .

Applications:
*1961–1963 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (option)
*1961–1964 Oldsmobile Super 88 (standard)
*1961–1964 Oldsmobile 98 (standard)

====Starfire====
The high-compression four-barrel 394 cu. in. 1964 Starfire produced and for the 1963-4 Starfire and 98 Custom-Sports Coupe. It was optional on 1964 98s and Super 88s.

==Aluminum 215 ==
From 1961-1963, Oldsmobile manufactured its own version of the Buick-designed, all-aluminum 215 cubic inch (3.5L) V8 engine for the F-85 compact. Known variously as the Rockette, Cutlass, and Turbo-Rocket by Oldsmobile (and as Fireball and Skylark by Buick), it was a compact, lightweight engine measuring long, wide, and high, with a dry weight of only . The Oldsmobile engine was very similar to the Buick engine, but not identical: it had larger wedge combustion chambers with flat-topped (rather than domed) pistons, six bolts rather than five per cylinder head, and slightly larger intake valves; the valves were actuated by shaft-mounted rocker arms like the Buick and Pontiac versions, but the shafts and rockers were unique to Oldsmobile. With an 8.75:1 compression ratio and a 2-barrel carburetor, the Olds 215 had the same rated hp, at 4800 rpm, as the Buick 215, with of torque at 2400 rpm. With a 4-barrel carburetor and 10.25:1 compression, the Olds 215 made at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm with a manual transmission. With a 4-barrel carburetor and 10.75:1 compression, the Olds 215 made at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm with an automatic. The Buick version was rated at 200 hp with an 11:1 compression ratio. The Oldsmobile Turbo-Rocket had 10.25:1 compression and was rated at .

The Buick version of the 215 V8 went on to become the well known Rover V8, which still remains in limited production, utilizing the Buick-style pistons, heads, and valve train gear.

The Oldsmobile engine block formed the basis of the Repco 3-liter engine used by Brabham to win the 1966 and 1967 Formula One world championships. The early Repco engines produced up to , and featured new SOHC cylinder heads and iron cylinder liners. The 1967 and later versions of the Repco engine had proprietary engine blocks.

In the mid-1980s, hot rodders discovered the 215 could be stretched to as much as , using the Buick 300 crankshaft, new cylinder sleeves, and an assortment of non-GM parts. It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan +8.

===Turbo-Rocket===

In 1962 and 1963 Oldsmobile built a turbocharged version of the 215, designated &quot;Turbo-Rocket&quot;. The turbocharger fitted to the V8 engine was a small-diameter Garrett T5 model with integral wastegate, manufactured by Garrett AiResearch, and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at at 4600 rpm and at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed &quot;Turbo-Rocket Fluid&quot;) into the intake manifold air-stream to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket Fluid path would set a second butterfly (positioned between the throttle butterfly and the turbocharger) into the closed position, limiting the amount of boost pressure. Many customers did not keep the reservoir filled, or had mechanical problems with the turbocharger system which resulted in many of the turbo-charger installations being removed and a conventional 4-barrel carburetor and manifold installed in its place.

The &quot;Turbo-Rocket&quot; V8 was offered exclusively on the Oldsmobile Jetfire, a special version of the Cutlass compact hardtop coupe, which is noteworthy as it is one of the world&#x27;s first (in fact the second) turbocharged passenger car ever offered for public sale. The Chevrolet Corvair Spyder Turbo, likewise a forced induction i.e turbo-powered car, predated the Oldsmobile Jetfire Turbo, however by only a few weeks, thus being the world&#x27;s very first turbocharged commercially sold vehicle.

==Generation II==

The second generation of Oldsmobile V8s was produced from 1964-1990. Most of these engines were very similar, using the same bore centers and a deck height, raised on &quot;big-block&quot; versions to . Big-block and Diesel versions also increased the main bearing journal to for increased strength. All generation-2 small-block Olds V8s used the same stroke of . The big-block engines initially used a forged crankshaft with a stroke of 3.975&quot; for the 1965-1967 425 and 400 CID versions; starting in 1968, both the and the big blocks used a stroke of , with crankshaft material changed to cast iron except in a few rare cases.

These were wedge-head engines with a unique combustion chamber that resulted from a valve angle of only 6°. This was much flatter than the 23° of the small-block Chevrolet and 20° of the Ford small-block wedge heads. This very open and flat chamber was fuel efficient and had lower than average emissions output. It was the only GM engine to meet US emission standards using a carburetor all the way up to 1990.

===330===
The first second-generation Oldsmobile V8 &quot;Jetfire Rocket&quot; introduced in 1964 and produced through 1967. It was released one year earlier than the tall deck 425, and debuted the standard stroke; bore was . 330s were painted gold and had forged steel crankshafts. The 4-barrel versions had a larger diameter harmonic damper, the 2 barrel only a balancer hub without the rubberized outer ring.

===400===
The version was the second, tall-deck &quot;big-block&quot; Olds. Two distinct versions of the 400 CID engine were made:
*1965-1967 &quot;Early&quot; 400s used a slightly oversquare bore and stroke for an overall displacement of . All the pre-1968 engines used a forged steel crankshaft.
====4-4-2 Rocket====
The 1966-1967 4-4-2 V8 was a short stroke engine which featured B and C cast large-valve cylinder heads and hydraulic lifters of larger diameter, as well as push-rods of different length and diameter than the standard Olds Rocket V8. It was rated at and of torque with a Rochester 4-barrel, and with the L69 tri 2-barrel option in 1966. A nominal 360 hp was claimed in 1967 when equipped with a W30 camshaft, 4-barrel, and outside air induction, 502 of which were factory produced. They were all painted Bronze and had V and G stamped on the cylinder heads.

====Undersquare version (1968)====
*1968 and 1969 400s shared the Olds big-block standard stroke with the 455 but used a undersquare bore to comply with GM&#x27;s maximum 400 cu. in. displacement restrictions in the A-body cars while also reducing tooling costs. Displacement is similar to the earlier engine, at . This &quot;later&quot; 400 is considered less desirable by many enthusiasts, because of the power band characteristics induced by this undersquare format, although the actual change in power was due to the mild 250/264 duration cam used in this engine (previous 400s used a 278/282 cam) and the fact that the crankshafts were now made of cheaper less durable high nodular iron material.

:&quot;Early 400s&quot; used the same forged steel crankshaft as the 425, while &quot;later 400s&quot; used the same cast iron crankshaft of the 455, with rare exceptions; some 1968 and later Olds 400/455s were produced with forged steel crankshafts. These rare cranks can be readily spotted by the J-shaped notch in the OD of the rear flange; cast iron cranks have a C-shaped notch. All 1965-1969 Olds 400s were painted bronze.

===425===
The big-block was the first tall-deck &quot;big block,&quot; produced from 1965 through 1967. It is arguably the best engine Olds made in the muscle car era, although it never made it into a &quot;muscle car&quot;. It used a bore and stroke. Most 425s were painted red, though the 1966 and 1967 Toronado units were light blue. All 425 engines were fitted with forged steel crankshafts with harmonic balancers.

====Super Rocket====
The standard 1965-1967 was called the Super Rocket, and was the most powerful engine option for the Oldsmobile 88 and 98 of 1965-1967. Compression ratios of 9.0:1 at or 10.25:1 at were available in the U.S.

====Starfire====
A special 1965-1967 V8 was the Starfire engine. The main distinguishing features of this engine were a slightly different camshaft profile from the standard ultra high compression engine and factory dual exhaust. This engine was only available in the Oldsmobile Starfire, delta 88 and a performance economy model called the Jetstar I. It shared the same compression ratio of the Toronado Rocket at 10.5:1. It also used the .921 in lifter bore size of the Toronado Rocket.

====Toronado Rocket====

An Ultra High Compression Toronado Rocket version of the V8 was made for the 1966 Toronado. It had the same -diameter lifters of the first-generation Oldsmobile engines, rather than the standard , which let engineers increase the camshaft&#x27;s ramp speed for more power, , without sacrificing idle or reliability. Unlike all other 425s, this version was painted slate blue metallic.

===455===

The 425&#x27;s stroke was lengthened to to achieve to create the Rocket 455 for 1968. It kept the retired 425&#x27;s bore to produce between . Initially the paint was red, except for metallic blue in the Toronado applications; 1970-1976 versions were metallic blue at first, then nonmetallic blue. The &quot;Rocket&quot; name disappeared from the air cleaner identification decal after 1974. Although production of the 455 ended in 1976, a small number were produced through 1978 for power equipment use, such as motorhomes, boats and irrigation equipment.

Applications:
*Oldsmobile Cutlass
*Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser (1970–76)
*Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser
*Oldsmobile 4-4-2
*Oldsmobile Hurst/Olds, 
*Oldsmobile 88
*Oldsmobile 98
*1968–1970 Oldsmobile Toronado, 
*1968–1970 Oldsmobile Toronado GT (W34), 
*1973–1976 GMC Motorhome

===350===
Produced from 1968–1980, the Rocket 350 was entirely different from the other GM divisions&#x27; 350s. It used a very oversquare bore and Oldsmobile small-block standard stroke for . Output ranged from . 1968-1974 350s were painted gold; 1975-1976 350s were metallic blue like the 455; 1977-1980 models were painted GM Corporate Blue. The &quot;Rocket&quot; name disappeared from the air cleaner decal in 1975, the same year that the catalytic converter was added to the emissions control system.

The Oldsmobile 350s made from 1968-1976 have heavy castings, beefier crankshafts, and better flowing heads. The 1977-1980 350s have lighter castings, including a thinner block with large &quot;windows&quot; in the main bearing bulkheads, and have crack-prone cylinder head castings manufactured by Pontiac Motor Division (castings are marked &quot;PMD&quot;; these heads were also used on the 260), and a lightened crankshaft.

The 1976-1979 Cadillac Seville was equipped with a version of this engine featuring an analog Bendix/Bosch electronic port fuel injection system, making this the first American mass-produced car with EFI as standard equipment.

*1979 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais (Hurst/Olds W-30 VIN &quot;R&quot; code)
*1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais (442 W-30 VIN &quot;R&quot; code)

====L34====
Oldsmobile&#x27;s own L34 R code V8 was used in the 1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass &quot;S&quot;, 1979 Hurst/Olds models and 1980 &quot;4-4-2&quot;. The L34 used a 4-barrel carburetor and produced and .

===403===
The 455 big block Olds V8 was replaced in 1977 with the small block, which used a bore, the largest ever used in a small-block V8, with the Olds small-block standard deck and stroke. The bore was so wide that the cylinder walls were siamesed, as in the Chevrolet 400 V8, with no space for coolant to flow between the cylinders. Additionally, the 403 had windowed main webs, which reduced the internal strength of the block in the crankcase area. It has been purported that there is a 403 Oldsmobile block and cast that has solid main webs that may have been equipped in vehicles such as the Pontiac Firebird equipped with a towing package, but there are currently no clearly documented surviving examples.

The 403 is fundamentally the exact same block as an Oldsmobile 350 V8, however it features a larger bore. Most components and accessories are interchangeable. A popular modification made to the 403 to increase power was to swap on early Oldsmobile 350 heads to boost compression. The 403 was never featured with a manual transmission and the crank was never manufactured for a pilot bearing. It was generally paired with the Turbo Hydramatic 350 3-speed automatic or the Turbo Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic in rear wheel drive vehicles, in the case of front-wheel drive vehicles, the Turbo Hydramatic 425 FWD 3-speed automatic. It always featured the 4A 83cc heads with 8:1 compression, and a Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburettor. The 403 Oldsmobile was generally painted &quot;Corporate GM Blue&quot; on every model line it was equipped in.

The Olds 403 was used by Buick and Pontiac in addition to Oldsmobile until its discontinuation after 1979. Output was and . Uniquely in the 1977 Toronado, the 403 engine was fitted with a crank triggered ignition system. Parts peculiar to this system include a toothed disc between the harmonic balancer and the crank pulley, the &quot;adjacent sensor&quot; (an early form of crankshaft position sensor), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dashboard.

=== 260===
A smaller V8 was created for the new Oldsmobile Omega in 1975 by decreasing the bore to . It produced net and . SAE gross power was 150 hp. The 260 V8 received VIN code &quot;F&quot; and had a sales code of LV8. This was the first engine to use the smaller Rochester Dualjet two-barrel carburetor, the only carburetor used on the 260. Production of the 260 V8 ended in 1982 when the 307 became the only gasoline V8 in Oldsmobile&#x27;s line. The 260 was designed for economy, and was the first engine option above the Chevrolet 250 straight-six, then later the 3.8 L Buick V6, which was standard fitment in many Oldsmobile models by the late 1970s. While the 260s were not very powerful compared to the larger 350 and 403 V8s, fuel economy was almost as good as the base V6. Compared to the V6, the 260 was also smoother-running, and far more durable. Most 260s were coupled to the Turbo Hydramatic 200 transmission, but a 5-speed manual transmission was also available in some vehicles.

Applications:

===307===
A slightly larger version was introduced in 1980. It uses a bore (in common with the Buick 231 V6 and 350 V8) with a stroke. Some early 307s were painted GM Corporate blue, but most were painted satin black. It was used in most Oldsmobile models, as well as those from Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and Pontiac. Every 307 used a four-barrel carburetor, which was a variant of the Rochester Quadrajet, usually the CCC (Computer Command Control) Quadrajet.

The output of the 307 wasn&#x27;t particularly high in terms of horsepower. For example, the stock (non-high-output, VIN &quot;Y&quot;) in the 1983 Oldsmobile 98 was a mere , although in that year a high-output model (VIN &quot;9&quot;) was available producing a nominal , at approximately torque. The final 1990 configuration was rated at at 3200 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. The combination of good torque at low engine speeds, the Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor, and the THM-200-4R three-speed plus overdrive automatic transmission having a lockup torque converter allowed for decent performance, and fuel economy considered reasonable for the era, even in the larger and heavier model cars. The engine is also known for its reliability, smoothness and quietness.

====LG8====
The LG8 was a modern &quot;High-Output&quot; derivative of the LV2 produced from 1983 to 1987. Performance modifications included a &quot;hot&quot; camshaft (in reality, just a camshaft used in various applications during the &#x27;70s with .440&quot;/.440&quot; lift and 196°/208° duration at .050&quot;), stiffer valve springs, a larger vibration damper (same as all &#x27;73-&#x27;79 350s, 403s, and 455s), a Y-pipe dual-outlet exhaust system, and richer secondary metering rods in the carburetor. It was offered in the Hurst/Olds version of the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and in the 4-4-2 version of the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon. Output for 1983-1985 was and . Revisions to the engine for 1986 included roller lifters with a slightly smaller camshaft (.435&quot;/.438&quot; lift and 194°/210° duration at .050&quot;), new heads with smaller, swirl-port intake runners, floating piston pins, and larger piston dishes for lower compression (8.0:1 &quot;v&quot;. 8.4:1). These changes increased torque to but lowered power to , while lowering the RPM at which peak power and torque was achieved.

Applications:
*1983–1984 Hurst/Olds
*1985–1987 Oldsmobile 4-4-2
*1985–1988 Cadillac Brougham VIN &quot;9&quot;

==Generation 3==

The Generation II V8 ended production in 1990. The company later introduced a new vehicle, the Oldsmobile Aurora, with a new generation V8. Based on the Cadillac Northstar engine, this 4.0-liter engine, called Aurora, was a DOHC design with four valves per cylinder. Apart from the Oldsmobile Aurora, the Aurora V8 was also used in the Shelby Series 1.

From the 1950s through the late 1970s, each GM division had its own V8 engine family. Many were shared among other divisions, but each design was unique:
*Buick V8 engine
*Cadillac V8 engine
*Chevrolet Small-Block engine
*Chevrolet Big-Block engine
*Pontiac V8 engine
*Holden V8 engine

GM later standardized on the later generations of the Chevrolet design:
*GM LT engine - Generation II small-block
*GM LS engine - Generation III/IV small-block

<text>Małgorzata Teresa Dydek-Twigg, also known as Margo Dydek (28 April 1974 – 27 May 2011), was a Polish professional basketball player. Standing tall, she was famous for being the tallest professional female basketball player in the world. She played center position for multiple teams in the WNBA and was a coach for the Northside Wizards in the Queensland Basketball League. She was awarded the Polish Gold Cross of Merit (1999).

She was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Margo Dydek was born 28 April 1974 in Warsaw, Poland, to a father and a mother. She had two sisters; her elder sister, Katarzyna () had played for the Colorado Xplosion of the now-defunct ABL. Her younger sister, Marta (), graduated from the University of Texas–El Paso where she played basketball, and played professionally in Spain in the 2000s.

==WNBA career==
Dydek made her first trip to the United States in May 1998 for WNBA pre-draft camp. Dydek was drafted 1st overall in the 1998 WNBA draft by the Utah Starzz (the franchise was subsequently transferred to San Antonio).

On 16 April 2005, during the 2005 WNBA draft, the San Antonio Silver Stars traded Dydek to the Connecticut Sun in exchange for the Sun&#x27;s first-round draft pick, Katie Feenstra from Liberty University.

Records held:
*All-time leader in blocks (877), in 323 games
*Leader in season total blocks nine times (1998–2003, 2005–07)
*Leader in season blocks per game eight times (1998–2003, 2006, 2007)
*Most defensive rebounds (214) in 2001

On 3 June 2008, Dydek signed with the Los Angeles Sparks, following time away from basketball due to her pregnancy. She had given birth to her son, David, in April that year.

==European career==
Dydek played for Olimpia Poznań from 1992 to 1994, before playing for Valenciennes Orchies in France from 1994 to 1996, where she met her future husband, David. She then moved to Spain and played for Pool Getafe from 1996 to 1998, and moved back to Poland to play for Fota Porta Gdynia starting with the 1998–99 season. She continued to play with the club through several sponsorship changes; since then, the club has taken the names Polpharma and Lotos.

In 1999–2000 she averaged 18.5 points and 10.7 rebounds for Gdynia in FIBA EuroLeague play. She was named Most Valuable Player of the Polish League Finals of the 1999–2000 season. In 1999, she was also named the best female basketball player in Europe by the Italian sports magazine &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. Dydek was chosen as Poland&#x27;s Sports Woman of the Year and was a member of the Poland women&#x27;s national basketball team until 2007, winning the EuroBasket Women 1999. She helped lead Gdynia to runner-up finishes in the FIBA EuroLeague in 2002 and 2004.

<text>Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger disease (English ; ) or Winiwarter-Buerger disease, is a recurring progressive inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of small and medium arteries and veins of the hands and feet. It is strongly associated with use of tobacco products, primarily from smoking, but is also associated with smokeless tobacco.

==Signs and symptoms==
There is a recurrent acute and chronic inflammation and thrombosis of arteries and veins of the hands and feet. The main symptom is pain in the affected areas, at rest and while walking (claudication). The impaired circulation increases sensitivity to cold. Peripheral pulses are diminished or absent. There are color changes in the extremities. The colour may range from cyanotic blue to reddish blue. Skin becomes thin and shiny. Hair growth is reduced. Ulcerations and gangrene in the extremities are common complications, often resulting in the need for amputation of the involved extremity.

==Pathophysiology==
There are characteristic pathologic findings of acute inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of arteries and veins of the hands and feet (the lower limbs being more common). The mechanisms underlying Buerger&#x27;s disease are still largely unknown, but smoking and tobacco consumption are major factors associated with it. It has been suggested that the tobacco may trigger an immune response in susceptible persons or it may unmask a clotting defect, either of which could incite an inflammatory reaction of the vessel wall.
A possible role for &quot;Rickettsia&quot; in this disease has been proposed.

==Diagnosis==

A concrete diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans is often difficult as it relies heavily on exclusion of other conditions. The commonly followed diagnostic criteria are outlined below although the criteria tend to differ slightly from author to author. Olin (2000) proposes the following criteria:
# Typically between 20 and 40 years old and male, although recently females have been diagnosed.
# Current (or recent) history of tobacco use.
# Presence of distal extremity ischemia (indicated by claudication, pain at rest, ischemic ulcers or gangrene) documented by noninvasive vascular testing such as ultrasound.
# Exclusion of other autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and diabetes mellitus by laboratory tests.
# Exclusion of a proximal source of emboli by echocardiography and arteriography.
# Consistent arteriographic findings in the clinically involved and noninvolved limbs.

Buerger&#x27;s disease can be mimicked by a wide variety of other diseases that cause diminished blood flow to the extremities. These other disorders must be ruled out with an aggressive evaluation, because their treatments differ substantially from that of Buerger&#x27;s disease, for which there is no treatment known to be effective.

Some diseases with which Buerger&#x27;s disease may be confused include atherosclerosis (build-up of cholesterol plaques in the arteries), endocarditis (an infection of the lining of the heart), other types of vasculitis, severe Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon associated with connective tissue disorders (e.g., lupus or scleroderma), clotting disorders or the production of clots in the blood.

Angiograms of the upper and lower extremities can be helpful in making the diagnosis of Buerger&#x27;s disease. In the proper clinical setting, certain angiographic findings are diagnostic of Buerger&#x27;s. These findings include a &quot;corkscrew&quot; appearance of arteries that result from vascular damage, particularly the arteries in the region of the wrists and ankles. Collateral circulation gives &quot;tree root&quot; or &quot;spider leg&quot; appearance. Angiograms may also show occlusions (blockages) or stenosis (narrowings) in multiple areas of both the arms and legs. Distal plethysmography also yields useful information about circulatory status in digits.
To rule out other forms of vasculitis (by excluding involvement of vascular regions atypical for Buerger&#x27;s), it is sometimes necessary to perform angiograms of other body regions (e.g., a mesenteric angiogram).

Skin biopsies of affected extremities are rarely performed because of the frequent concern that a biopsy site near an area poorly perfused with blood will not heal well.

==Prevention==

The cause of the disease is thought to be autoimmune in nature and heavily linked to tobacco use in patients with Buerger&#x27;s as primary disease.

==Treatment==
Smoking cessation has been shown to slow the progression of the disease and decrease the severity of amputation in most patients, but does not halt the progression.

In acute cases, drugs and procedures which cause vasodilation are effective in reducing pain experienced by patient. For example, prostaglandins like Limaprost are vasodilators and give relief of pain, but do not help in changing the course of disease. Epidural anesthesia and hyperbaric oxygen therapy also have vasodilator effect. There is moderate certainty evidence that intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) is more effective than aspirin for relieving rest pain and healing ischemic ulcers. No difference have been detected between iloprost or clinprost (prostacyclin) and alprostadil (prostaglandin analogue) for relieving pain and healing ulcers.

In chronic cases, lumbar sympathectomy may be occasionally helpful. It reduces vasoconstriction and increases blood flow to limb. It aids in healing and giving relief from pain of ischemic ulcers. Bypass can sometimes be helpful in treating limbs with poor perfusion secondary to this disease. Use of vascular growth factor and stem cell injections have been showing promise in clinical studies. There may be a benefit of using bone marrow-derived stem cells in healing ulcers and improving pain-free walking distance, but larger, high-quality trials are needed. Debridement is done in necrotic ulcers. In gangrenous digits, amputation is frequently required. Below-knee and above-knee amputation is rarely required.

Streptokinase has been proposed as adjuvant therapy in some cases.

Despite the clear presence of inflammation in this disorder, anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids have not been shown to be beneficial in healing, but do have significant anti-inflammatory and pain relief qualities in low dosage intermittent form. Similarly, strategies of anticoagulation have not proven effective.
physical therapy: interferential current therapy to decrease inflammation.

==Prognosis==
Buerger&#x27;s is not immediately fatal. Amputation is common and major amputations (of limbs rather than fingers/toes) are almost twice as common in patients who continue to smoke. Prognosis markedly improves if a person quits smoking. Female patients tend to show much higher longevity rates than men. The only known way to slow the progression of the disease is to abstain from all tobacco products.

==Epidemiology==
Buerger&#x27;s is more common among men than women. Although present worldwide, it is more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East. Incidence of thromboangiitis obliterans is 8 to 12 per 100,000 adults in the United States (0.75% of all patients with peripheral vascular disease).

==History==
Buerger&#x27;s disease was first described by Felix von Winiwarter in 1879 in Austria. It was not until 1908, however, that the disease was given its first accurate pathological description, by Leo Buerger at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who referred to the condition as &quot;presenile spontaneous gangrene&quot;.

==Notable people affected==
As reported by Alan Michie in &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, published in 1952 (see pages 194 and following), King George VI was diagnosed with the disease on 12 November 1948. Both legs were affected, the right more seriously than the left. The king&#x27;s doctors prescribed complete rest and electric treatment to stimulate circulation, but as they were either unaware of the connection between the disease and smoking (the king was a heavy smoker) or unable to persuade the king to stop smoking, the disease failed to respond to their treatment. On 12 March 1949, the king underwent a lumbar sympathectomy, performed at Buckingham Palace by James R. Learmonth. The operation, as such, was successful, but the king was warned that it was a palliative, not a cure, and that there could be no assurance that the disease would not grow worse. From all accounts, the king continued to smoke.

The author and journalist John McBeth describes his experiences of the disease, and treatment for it, in the chapter &quot;Year of the Leg&quot; in his book &quot;Reporter: Forty Years Covering Asia&quot;.

Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte disclosed in 2015 that he has Buerger&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="1081834" wikidata="Q3472079" url="?curid=1081834" title="Italian beef">
<text>An Italian beef is a sandwich, originating in Chicago, made from thin slices of roast beef simmered and served on French bread. Common toppings are a choice between spicy giardiniera (called &quot;hot&quot;) or mild bell peppers (called &quot;sweet&quot;). The entire sandwich is traditionally dipped in the juice the meat is cooked in before serving with a side of French fries.

The sandwich traces back to Italian American immigrants in Chicago as early as the 1930s, but the exact origin is unknown. The sandwich gradually grew in popularity and was widely eaten in the city by the 1970s and 1980s. The sandwich saw a substantial rise in popularity upon the release of the television show &quot;The Bear,&quot; set in a fictional Chicago restaurant which specializes in the sandwich.

==Preparation==
The sandwich is made from beef that has been roasted in beef stock and other seasonings. A 1962 recipe calls for bay leaves, garlic powder, tomato paste, and crushed dried red pepper. The choice of beef cut varies. Inside round is commonly used due to its ease of preparation, but some restaurants use top sirloin. The meat is cooked until it is not pink in the middle, unlike that of a roast beef sandwich. When it is done, it is sliced as thinly as possible, usually thinner than one would for a roast beef sandwich. It is then soaked in the juices it was cooked in.

The sandwich is typically served on French bread, often baked at Turano Baking Co. in particular. It is important that the bread is crusty so it does not fall apart after being dipped.

Traditionally the sandwich is either ordered &quot;sweet&quot; with grilled or boiled bell peppers, or &quot;hot&quot; with spicy giardiniera. The sandwich can also be topped with cheese (mozzarella, provolone, or cheddar cheese) which is growing in popularity. Some restaurants offer the addition of Italian sausage, typically called a &quot;combo.&quot; Marinara sauce is sometimes offered as a topping. 

To assemble an Italian beef, the meat is transferred to the bread still wet, followed by the desired toppings. The completed sandwich is then traditionally dunked in juices before serving. The amount of juices added can be customized using terminology such as &quot;dipped,&quot; &quot;dunked,&quot; or &quot;wet,&quot; but the definitions vary among restaurants. An Italian beef can also be ordered &quot;dry&quot;, with or without a side of juice in a cup, similar to a French dip. An Italian beef is frequently ordered with a side of French fries, or sometimes an Italian ice.

Some restaurants sell &quot;gravy bread,&quot; bread dipped in juices without meat or toppings. This is cheaper than a full sandwich.

==History==
The exact origin of the sandwich is unknown. One possible origin is that the sandwich was invented by Italian American immigrants who sliced inexpensive beef cuts exceedingly thin to feed many people and to tenderize tougher cuts of beef that they were forced to buy due to discrimination. The beef was served on bread to further stretch the meal and mask the poor quality of the meat. Some historians believe that Pasquale Scala invented the sandwich in the 1920s to serve at weddings. Al&#x27;s Beef claims that Tony Ferreri invented the sandwich in the 1920s to serve at weddings; his son Al later began selling beef sandwiches in 1938. Others believe that Chicago restaurants adapted the French dip sandwich from Los Angeles in 1948 or 1949.

According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the sandwich was not very popular in the 1950s and 1960s, but it began to take off in the 1970s. By the 1980s, the sandwich was ubiquitous throughout Chicago, celebrities such as Neil Diamond and Jay Leno reportedly enjoyed the sandwich. Still, the sandwich was mostly unknown outside the city until the release of &quot;The Bear&quot; in 2022. Restaurants across the U.S. reported a surge in demand for the sandwich in the months following the premiere of the show. Chris Zucchero, owner of Mr. Beef, starred in the pilot episode, which was filmed in his restaurant.

<doc id="1081836" wikidata="Q7085738" url="?curid=1081836" title="Oldsmobile Diesel engine">
<text>The Oldsmobile Diesel engine is a series of V6 and V8 diesel engines produced by General Motors from 1978 to 1985. Their design was based on the Olds 350 gasoline engine architecture.
A V8 was introduced in 1978, followed by a V8 only for the 1979 model year. In 1982, a V6 became available for both front front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive vehicles. 

Sales peaked in 1981 at approximately 310,000 units, which represented 60% of the total U.S. passenger vehicle diesel market. This success was short-lived as the V8 version suffered severe reliability issues. Although GM carried out several redesigns, by the time the engine was trouble-free, the damage to its reputation had been done, and it was discontinued after the 1985 model year. The later design V6 diesel did not have the problems of the V8. 

The shortcomings of the engine, and the publicity around it, negatively affected American light diesel engine sales for years to come.

==Problems==
One Oldsmobile engineer who had worked on the V8 diesel told his bosses not to release the hastily developed engine. Needing to meet upcoming CAFE standards, GM forced him into early retirement and released the engine nonetheless.

Simultaneous problems with GM&#x27;s new THM200 automatic transmission made the overall problem worse. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) had been unable to certify the diesel V8 for sale in the state in 1979 and early 1980 as the test cars issued to CARB broke down before the tests could be completed. Of the nine cars supplied to CARB, all suffered engine problems and seven had transmission failures. 

Myriad lawsuits were filed as several grassroots groups formed to try to get General Motors to acknowledge the issues. In 1980 the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint which included the diesel engine issues and the transmission troubles, as well as camshaft issues with gasoline V8s. General Motors kept marketing the diesel to the fullest, with 19 of the 23 Oldsmobile models in 1981 being available with the 5.7 diesel.

The sales and reliability woes were compounded by a decline in gas prices as well as fuel quality issues, including large volumes of diesel fuel containing water or foreign particles.

A class action lawsuit eventually forced General Motors to pay up to 80 percent of the costs of new engines. A large number of cars simply had their broken diesels replaced with conventional gasoline engines. Used car price guides have always indicated much lower prices for diesel-engined cars and they remain undesirable in the collector&#x27;s market.

The Oldsmobile diesel&#x27;s reputation for unreliability and anemic performance damaged the North American passenger diesel market for the next 30 years. 

==Design and flaws==
While designing the original 350 cu in diesel, Oldsmobile left the head bolt design and pattern unchanged to enable them to use the same tooling as for the gasoline engines, unlike a proper gasoline to diesel conversion. This led to catastrophic head bolt failures as diesel engines have compression ratios that are as much as three times higher than a gasoline engine. 

In addition to the head bolt issues, General Motors also decided not to install a water separator in order to cut costs. Low quality diesel fuel was a common problem at the time and most diesels were thus equipped to keep the injector pumps from corroding. Many owners tried to solve this by adding anhydrous alcohol, a common trick to deal with water in fuel, but this instead dissolved fuel pump seals and other parts. 

The stretchy fuel-pump timing chain was a minor problem in light of the other issues. Poor dealer service training only made all the problems worse. 

General Motors also carried out several redesigns of the V8&#x27;s heads, bolts, and various other parts, but by the time the engine was trouble-free the reputation damage had already been done. The upgraded engines, as built by model year 1981, were identified as &quot;350 DX&quot; on the block.

The later 4.3-liter V6 engine, which arrived for the 1982 model year, did not have the same problems as the V8. The V6 has a denser bolt pattern and Oldsmobile&#x27;s engineers were given more time to develop and test it.

==Discontinuation==
While customer complaints started dropping off after 1981, sales did too: diesels sold 43 percent less in 1982. The downward sales slide continued, not helped by stricter emissions standards - for the 1984 model year the diesel V8 was no longer offered in California for that very reason. 

General Motors had built a whole new plant for the V6 diesel, but sales thereof never broke 30,000 annually. Production ran at less than ten percent of capacity and much of the tooling had never even been unpacked by the time it was discontinued.

In December 1984, General Motors announced the Oldsmobile Diesel engines would be discontinued during the 1985 model year. GM continued to offer Isuzu&#x27;s 4FB1 1.8-liter four cylinder diesel in the Chevrolet Chevette/Pontiac 1000, but after only 588 of these were sold in 1986, the company went on to abandon the diesel passenger car segment entirely for many decades. 

Although the engines were unreliable because of the head and problems with the ancillaries, the Oldsmobile diesels&#x27; strong blocks continue to see use in gasoline-powered race engines.

<text>Shirley Alston Reeves (born June 10, 1941), born Shirley Owens, is an American soul singer who was the main lead singer of the hit girl group the Shirelles.

== The Shirelles ==
In addition to Owens, The Shirelles consisted of fellow Passaic High School (New Jersey) alumni Doris Kenner Jackson, Addie &quot;Micki&quot; Harris McPhadden and Beverly Lee. Owens&#x27; strong, distinctive voice meant that she was a natural choice for the lead singer, though Jackson was also featured as lead on several songs, as well.

Reeves enjoyed a string of hits with The Shirelles throughout the 1960s, the most notable being &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;. She left The Shirelles in 1975 to begin a solo career, initially recording under the name &quot;Lady Rose&quot;.

The Shirelles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. She also performed on the &quot;Doo Wop 51&quot; PBS special in 2000.

== Solo ==
In 1975, she recorded an album entitled &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot;, after the hit song by the Beatles, which featured members of the Flamingos, the Drifters, Shep and the Limelites, the Five Satins, the Belmonts, Danny &amp; the Juniors, Herman&#x27;s Hermits and La La Brooks of the Crystals.

Shirley continues to tour under the name &#x27;Shirley Alston Reeves and her Shirelles&#x27;.

== Personal life ==
Through marriages, she became Shirley Alston and later, Shirley Alston Reeves. Her nephew, Gerald Alston is the lead singer of The Manhattans.

<doc id="1081840" wikidata="Q4943236" url="?curid=1081840" title="Doris Coley">
<text>Doris Coley (August 2, 1941 – February 4, 2000) was an American musician, who was best known as a member (and occasional lead singer) of the Shirelles. Doris was the lead singer on their biggest hit, &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;. She initially left the group in 1968, but returned in 1975 after original lead singer, Shirley Owens, left. Through marriages, she became Doris Coley Kenner and later Doris Kenner Jackson.

== Life ==
Coley was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina to Zeno and Ruth Best Coley as the oldest of five children but moved with her family to Passaic, New Jersey after her mother&#x27;s death. With schoolmates Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Addie &quot;Micki&quot; Harris and Beverly Lee, she formed the Shirelles in Passaic in 1958, one of the first all-girl groups of the rock era. The four teenagers did not graduate with their class of 1958, but they earned diplomas later. They performed their self-written &quot;I Met Him on a Sunday&quot; for Florence Greenberg and was signed to her Tiara label (the song was so popular, it was bought by Decca Records).

Coley was married two times. Coley married Alfonza Kenner, who she had two sons with, Gary and Antonio, and they remained married until his death. She married Wallace Jackson and have twins, Staci (later Richardson) and Tracy Jackson. Many years later, in 1994, when the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave the Shirelles a Heritage Award, Kenner sang with the group&#x27;s other surviving members, Alston Reeves and Lee, for the first time in 19 years (Harris having died in 1982). The threesome met again when they were inducted into the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.

== Death ==
Coley died of breast cancer at the age of 58 on February 4, 2000.

<text>The National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) was a historic railway between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Moncton, New Brunswick, in Canada. Much of the line is now operated by the Canadian National Railway.

==The Grand Trunk partnership==

The completion of construction of Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) on November 7, 1885, preceded a tremendous economic expansion and immigration boom in western Canada during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but the monopolistic policies of the CPR, coupled with its southerly routing (new scientific discoveries were pushing the northern boundary of cereal crops), led to increasing western discontent with the railway and federal transportation policies.

The federal government had encouraged the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) system in the 1870s to consider building the transcontinental rail line. During the same time, a government survey party under the direction of Sandford Fleming set out across Canada to survey routes for the proposed railway. The &quot;Canadian Pacific Survey&quot;, as it was called, surveyed routes to a number of Pacific Coast destinations (including Victoria on Vancouver Island). When Grand Trunk balked at building a railway using the survey, the government turned to the privately owned Canadian Pacific. The CPR, one of whose directors was James J. Hill, a Canadian who had settled in Minnesota (and eventual builder of the transcontinental Great Northern Railway located just south of the US/Canada border), favoured a route farther south, as Hill hoped to tap into freight flows from the northern US states. That left Canada with a single transcontinental route close to the US border, since CPR chose to use Rogers and Kicking Horse Passes rather than the surveyed route over the Yellowhead.

By the early 1900s, the GTR was willing to consider building a second transcontinental system for the country if it received government assistance, similar to the CPR&#x27;s deal. However, while the government and GTR were considering whether to proceed and negotiating terms, the Canadian Northern Railway was already building a second transcontinental rail line.

The Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) was an upstart regional system for the prairies that had begun in Manitoba under entrepreneurs William Mackenzie and Donald Mann in 1899 through their amalgamation of several smaller branch lines. The CNoR started the process of building Canada&#x27;s second transcontinental system between 1903 and 1912. The system was built from Winnipeg westbound to Vancouver and eastbound to Toronto and Montreal. In addition to an extensive network of branch lines in the prairie provinces, CNoR had many branch lines in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces.

But Mackenzie and Mann had spurned the federal government&#x27;s offer for assistance to expand the CNoR in 1903 and in doing so, the federal government under Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier committed to building a transcontinental system in partnership with the GTR. In keeping with the trend of railways to exploit virgin territories, the government-backed &quot;transcon&quot; would run from the port of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, across the northern portion of the prairies to Winnipeg, and from there across northern Ontario and Quebec to Quebec City where it would cross the St. Lawrence River and continue on to its eastern terminus at Moncton, New Brunswick, by way of a route directly across central New Brunswick.

The GTR board of directors wished to assume the financial risks only for the portion of the system west of Winnipeg and so the agreement resulted in two railway systems being funded by government: the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which would run from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert and be built and operated by GTR as a subsidiary, and the government-owned and -built National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) would run from Winnipeg to Moncton and be operated by GTR upon completion.
The GTPR/NTR deal came in the heady final days of Canada&#x27;s railway boom and would soon prove to be the financial straw that broke the back of Canada&#x27;s railway industry during the First World War. Canada has supported two transcontinental railway systems for many years, but even in 1914 it was not clear that there was enough traffic for three. The GTPR/NTR system was surveyed and construction began in 1905 and the entire system was finished (except for the Quebec Bridge) in 1913. The task was monumental and no expense was spared in building a railway system of minimal grades and curvature. In crossing the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick, the NTR used massive bridges, such as the Cap-Rouge trestle and the Little Salmon River Trestle (the second largest railway bridge in Canada) to span wide valleys. The Quebec Bridge over the St. Lawrence River, the largest cantilever span in the world, took $40 million of the $170 million total project cost alone. The territory across northern Quebec and Ontario to Winnipeg, through the heart of the Canadian Shield, posed an extremely difficult construction obstacle. It also generated very little traffic. 
The Grand Trunk Pacific/National Transcontinental route remained intact for only a few years during World War I. The GTP had built through the Yellowhead Pass on a route paralleled later by Canadian Northern, but near Mount Robson, GTP headed toward Prince Rupert. Prince Rupert was one of several possible Pacific termini for the line. Originally, Port Simpson on the Alaska border was selected, but a border dispute with the United States in the early 20th century left Canada concerned about the defensibility of any Pacific rail terminal, and the terminal for GTP was moved south to Prince Rupert. That selection potentially saved a day of steaming for ships to or from Asia.

Much GTP track through the Yellowhead Pass did not last even to the end of World War I. As a government-imposed war measure to garner rails for potential use in France, trackage was consolidated between Lobstick, Alberta, and Red Pass Junction, British Columbia with Canadian Northern in 1917, and rails were lifted from the nearly brand-new GTP.

==Canadian Government Railways==
The GTR reneged on its deal with the federal government for operating the eastern section (the NTR) and the government folded it, along with the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC), the Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR), and the Hudson Bay Railway (as well as some smaller lines) into the Canadian Government Railways in 1915 for administrative and financial purposes, although the individual systems maintained their independent names. The CGR and its subsidiaries would last until 1918.

==Canadian National Railways==
On September 6, 1918, the CNoR was nationalized after becoming insolvent and its government-appointed directors were ordered to assume operation of the CGR system. On December 20, 1918, the federal government created the Canadian National Railways (CNR) under which the CNoR and CGR were to be operated.

Several years later, on July 12, 1920, the GTPR was nationalized and entered the CNR fold. The GTR itself was placed under government control several weeks earlier on May 21, 1920; however, GTR was not merged into the CNR until January 23, 1923.

==Legacy==

The significant cost overruns in construction of the NTR/GTPR contributed to the downfall of Laurier&#x27;s Liberal Party in 1911, but Robert Borden&#x27;s Conservative Party was forced to finish the project, including the disastrous spanning of the St. Lawrence River with the Quebec Bridge.

The NTR route across northern Quebec and Ontario, far from the major population centres, had been approved by Laurier&#x27;s government largely because of the support of his Quebec caucus to make Quebec City the preferred port for western grain shipments. The NTR in those provinces never lived up to its expectations for creating traffic, but for a time, it aided the resource-rich mining communities of northern Ontario and northwestern Quebec.

Under CNR (CN post-1960), the NTR route across northern Quebec and Ontario became a marginal secondary main line, with little in the way of through freight or passenger traffic. At Nakina, the CNR had constructed the Longlac-Nakina Cut-Off, a section of track linking the NTR with the Canadian Northern line at Longlac, which was completed in 1924. A section of the NTR mainline between Nakina and Calstock, Ontario, was abandoned in 1986, and the Ontario Northland Railway purchased the section of NTR mainline between Calstock and Cochrane, Ontario, in 1993. The mainline was also abandoned by CN for east of Cochrane to La Sarre, Quebec, in 1997.

West of Nakina, the combined NTR/GTPR line forms CN&#x27;s transcontinental mainline through to Tête Jaune Cache, British Columbia, and sees very heavy traffic. From Tête Jaune Cache (Yellowhead Pass), the GTPR line to Prince Rupert is a secondary mainline, as the CNoR line southwest from Tête Jaune Cache to Vancouver forms the CN mainline. In the 1990s and 2000s, congestion at many ports along the west coast of North America made the GTPR&#x27;s development of Prince Rupert an attractive alternative. Canadian National Railways, now a private corporation, had completed port facilities at Prince Rupert capable of handling two million 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) per year and was lengthening passing sidings on the line from Jasper to Prince Rupert. CN now offers daily container train service between Prince Rupert, Chicago, and Memphis.

East of La Sarre to Quebec City, the former NTR mainline supports a network of CN branchlines in northern Quebec, but the Quebec Bridge and related trackage in the Quebec City area is heavily used by freight and passenger traffic as part of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor.

From Quebec City east to Pelletier, Quebec, the former NTR mainline was abandoned in the 1980s after the completion in 1976 of a &quot;cutoff&quot; from the latter station to CN&#x27;s former Intercolonial Railway mainline in the St. Lawrence River valley west of Rivière-du-Loup. However, from Pelletier east to Moncton, the NTR mainline across central New Brunswick, including the massive bridges in the Appalachian Mountains, is still heavily used since it forms the core of CN&#x27;s Montreal-Halifax mainline.

<text>The Orlons are an American R&amp;B group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that formed in 1960. The group won gold discs for three of their singles.

==Career==
The quartet consisted of lead singer Rosetta Hightower (June 23, 1944 – August 2, 2014), Shirley Brickley (December 9, 1944 – October 13, 1977), Marlena Davis (October 4, 1944 – February 27, 1993), and Stephen Caldwell (born November 22, 1942).

Before they became the Orlons, they were an all-girl quintet called Audrey and the Teenettes. They formed in the late 1950s in junior high school and consisted of Hightower, Davis, and three Brickley sisters: Shirley, Jean, and Audrey. However, after the Brickleys&#x27; mother did not permit 13-year-old Audrey to sing in certain nightclubs with the group, she and Jean quit, making the group a trio.

In high school, the group&#x27;s three remaining members discovered fellow student Stephen Caldwell, who was lead singer of a local group called the Romeos. Impressed, they invited him to join the group in 1960 and named themselves the Orlons as a tongue-in-cheek nod to the friendly rivalry they had with a popular group at their high school, the Cashmeres. (Orlon was a brand name for the widely used synthetic fiber acrylic.)

A high school friend, Dovells lead singer Len Barry, encouraged them to audition for Cameo-Parkway Records at the turn of the decade. The group took his advice in the fall of 1961, but were rejected at first, although the record label signed the group after two more auditions. Cameo executive Dave Appell appointed Hightower as the lead singer, and began writing songs for them.

In 1962, the group provided back-up vocals for Dee Dee Sharp&#x27;s hits &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot; and &quot;Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)&quot;. They later found fame with their first national hit, &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the US pop chart and which triggered the brief Watusi dance craze. They recorded their own versions of the Dee Dee Sharp songs for their debut album, &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot;, which received a rating of 4.5 out of 5 from AllMusic in 2006. They had a second hit in the same year with &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot;, a No. 4 hit on the pop chart. The group had three hits in 1963: &quot;South Street&quot;, the group&#x27;s last Top Ten hit, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard chart; &quot;Not Me&quot;, which reached No. 12; and &quot;Crossfire&quot;, the group&#x27;s last hit, which reached No. 19.

They also recorded a version of the Bobby Rydell hit &quot;The Cha-Cha-Cha&quot;, which includes the line &quot;When you see the Wah-Watusi, you go a-ha-ha-ha,&quot; poking fun at their own hit.

Davis left the group in August 1963 and Caldwell quit the group in 1964, Sandy Person replaced Davis. A short-lived stint by Yvonne Young was followed by original Teenette, Audrey Brickley, Shirley&#x27;s sister. By then, the group&#x27;s popularity had waned in the United States. They continued to perform into the late 1960s with success in the UK. They disbanded in 1968 after Hightower decided to stay in England after a tour. Hightower had a successful career as a soloist and as an in-demand session singer, backing Joe Cocker, John Holt and other artists. She married record producer Ian Green.

In later years, Davis married and found work as an executive secretary, whilst Caldwell became a shop steward of the bus drivers&#x27; trade union, and then became the administrator of the union&#x27;s legal fund in Philadelphia and served on the Philadelphia Board of Education for 29 years. In 1988, Caldwell and Davis re-formed the group with two new members and performed live on the oldies circuit until Davis&#x27; death in 1993.

On October 13, 1977, Shirley Brickley was shot dead by an intruder in her home in Philadelphia. Marlena Davis died of lung cancer on February 27, 1993 (aged 48). Audrey Brickley died of acute respiratory distress syndrome on July 3, 2005 (aged 58). Rosetta Hightower Green died in Clapham, London, on August 2, 2014, at the age of 70. Caldwell and Jean Brickley still perform as the Orlons with two of Caldwell&#x27;s cousins, Alberta Crump and Madeline Morris.

In March 2012, Caldwell and Brickley took part in the benefit single &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, featuring Charlie Gracie with Clutch Cargo.

<text>Rosetta Jeanette Hightower (23 June 1944 – 2 August 2014) was an American singer and the lead singer of the 1960s girl group The Orlons. She was born in Philadelphia.
==Background==
As lead singer of The Orlons, the Orlons recorded several Top 10 U.S. hits between 1962 and 1964, including &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot;, &quot;South Street&quot;, and &quot;Not Me&quot;. In early 1962, The Orlons provided backing vocals on Dee Dee Sharp&#x27;s &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot; (#2 pop, No. 1 R&amp;B). That spring, they recorded &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot; which, in July 1962, made it in the Billboard charts to the No. 2 spot. Around the same time, they recorded back-up vocals on Dee Dee Sharp&#x27;s second hit, &quot;Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)&quot; which went to No. 9. The follow-up to &quot;The Wah-Watusi&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hang Up&quot; reached No. 4 pop and No. 3 R&amp;B in the fall and winter of 1962. The Orlons&#x27; first major performance was at New York&#x27;s Apollo Theatre with The Crystals, Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans, Chuck Jackson, Tommy Hunt, and Gene Chandler. In 1963, they had hits with &quot;South Street&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 4 R&amp;B) and &quot;Crossfire&quot; (No. 19 Pop, No. 25 R&amp;B).

Hightower left the group in the late 1960s to pursue a solo career in the UK. She joined the ranks of the then-popular female session singers who backed many hit songs. This group included Madeline Bell, Lesley Duncan, Kiki Dee, and Sue and Sunny. She recorded with Joe Cocker on his &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; album.
==Career==
In 1968, Hightower released the single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give Back the Love I Feel for You&quot; bw &quot;Big Bird&quot; on Toast TT 509.

Moving permanently to England in 1970, Hightower married musician-producer Ian Green. She represented the US in Belgium for the first international singing contest ever held. She released numerous singles and at least two albums. In 1971, she was a backing vocalist for John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Power to the People&quot;.

==Death==
Rosetta Hightower Green died in Clapham, London, on 2 August 2014, aged 70. Her son, Ian Green, Jr., works as Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s main co-producer and remixer.

<doc id="1081854" wikidata="Q91913367" url="?curid=1081854" title="Vipsania Marcella">
<text>Vipsania Marcella is a name retrospectively given by historians to a possible daughter or daughters of the ancient Roman general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and his second wife Claudia Marcella Major, the eldest niece of emperor Augustus.

==History==
It was once thought that Agrippa and Marcella only had one surviving child together, a daughter whom no real information about was available, this daughter was given a composite name to distinguish her from her sisters from Agrippa&#x27;s other marriages. But as new information was discovered and men such as Quintus Haterius, Publius Quinctilius Varus, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus began to be speculated to have been Agrippa&#x27;s sons-in-law by a daughter or daughters of Marcella opinions began to shift. Ronald Syme believed the wives of each men were three different people, one Vipsania who married Varus, a Vipsania who married Lepidus and one Vipsania who married Haterius, but Syme also argued that Haterius wife was a daughter of Agrippa by his first wife Pomponia, not Marcella. Meyer Reinhold rebutted and argued that Varus wife was the daughter of Pomponia, L. Koenen has entertained this possibility as well, while Franziska Knopf thought that Haterius wife could be Marcella&#x27;s daughter. Some historians also think that Varus and Lepidus wives were not separate people. Nonetheless Syme&#x27;s view hold majority opinion in the 21st century.

==Cultural depictions==
In Robert Graves&#x27; books, &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot;, a single daughter of Agrippa and Marcella is mentioned to exist. She is depicted as having committed suicide for unexplained reasons early on, but later in the story Roman empress Livia claims that she killed herself over guilt for committing incest with her father, to secretly instigate his poisoning.

<doc id="1081858" wikidata="Q1659644" url="?curid=1081858" title="Brien McMahon">
<text>Brien McMahon (born James O&#x27;Brien McMahon) (October 6, 1903July 28, 1952) was an American lawyer and politician who served in the United States Senate (as a Democrat from Connecticut) from 1945 to 1952. McMahon was a major figure in the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission, through his authorship of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (the McMahon Act).

McMahon served as chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, and the first chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. McMahon was a key figure in the early years of atomic weapons development and an advocate for the civilian (rather than military) control of nuclear development in the USA. Also, in 1952, McMahon proposed an &quot;army&quot; of young Americans to act as &quot;missionaries of democracy&quot;, which sowed the seeds for what later became the Peace Corps.

==Early life and education==
McMahon was born in 1903 in Norwalk, Connecticut. McMahon graduated Fordham University in 1924 and then Yale Law School in 1927. McMahon changed his name to Brien McMahon the same year as being admitted to the bar.

==Justice career==
McMahon began a practice in Norwalk and later served as a judge on that town&#x27;s city court, appointed to the position by Connecticut Governor Wilbur L. Cross. However, McMahon quickly resigned to become special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States in 1933. Attorney General Homer Cummings was also from Connecticut. In 1935, McMahon was appointed as United States Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Department of Justice&#x27;s Criminal Division.

Among prominent cases associated with McMahon in the Criminal Division were the prosecutions of John Dillinger&#x27;s lawyer, Louis Piquette (for harboring a criminal) and the trials of gangsters associated with &#x27;Baby Face&#x27; Nelson.

However, the case that elevated McMahon to national renown and laid the foundation for his political career was the Harlan County Coal Miners&#x27; case. It was the first attempt to enforce the Wagner Act protecting unions. The case became famous, less for legal principles than for the violence and scandal surrounding the trial.

Although he lost, he &quot;received wide public recognition and a reputation as a courageous and honest upholder of justice, both of which would further his political ambitions,&quot; according to a biography accompanying the introduction to his papers, held by the Georgetown University Library.

In 1939, McMahon left government service and resumed his law practice. In February 1940 McMahon married Rosemary Turner (June 21, 1917October 11, 1986), and they had a daughter, Patricia. Rosemary was the half-sister of the British politician and best-selling novelist (Lord) Jeffrey Archer (1940 ).

==Congressional career==
McMahon mounted a successful campaign for a Connecticut United States Senate seat in 1944, defeating incumbent John A. Danaher, with internationalism (McMahon) vs. isolationism (Danaher) a major point of debate.

On July 16, 1945, an atomic bomb was successfully detonated at Alamogordo, New Mexico, after which Senator Brien McMahon of Connecticut called it &quot;the most important thing in history since the birth of Jesus Christ.&quot; In late 1945, McMahon was appointed Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, which explored legislative alternatives to the War Department sponsored May-Johnson bill. McMahon lacked knowledge about atomic energy, but saw the chairmanship as a means to assert himself as a new Senator, especially as the May-Johnson bill underwent increased attack from scientists and later lost support of the Truman White House.

On December 20, 1945, Brien McMahon introduced into the Senate legislation for an alternative atomic energy bill, which was quickly known as the McMahon Bill. The liberal bill placed control of atomic research in the hands of scientists and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon himself framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, even though the War Department bill was primarily a civilian bill as well. McMahon&#x27;s Special Committee on Atomic Energy held many hearings during late 1945 and early 1946, thereby airing arguments about domestic postwar legislation for controlling atomic energy. In the spring of 1946, the McMahon Bill underwent major revisions in order to appease conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed the Senate and the House. On August 1, 1946, President Harry Truman signed the McMahon Bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 created a special Congressional committee, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Brien McMahon served as its first chairman in 1946, and again in 1949–1952. McMahon hired as the committee&#x27;s executive staff director William L. Borden, who would play an influential role on the committee (and after McMahon&#x27;s death, in the Oppenheimer security hearing).

The first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union in August 1949 came earlier than expected by Americans, and McMahon immediately urged that U.S. production of atomic weapons be substantially increased. Moreover, during the next several months there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful hydrogen bomb, then known as &quot;the Super&quot;. McMahon was strongly in favor of going ahead with the Super, and argued as much in a series of letters he wrote to President Truman. The senator rejected morality-based arguments against the hydrogen bomb based on it being inherently more destructive than previous weapons, asking &quot;Where is the valid ethical distinction between&quot; the World War II multi-day-and-night bombing of Hamburg, the firebombing of Tokyo, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and any future raid with whatever technology that caused mass casualties.

Connecticut voters reelected McMahon to his Senate seat in 1950. During his entire tenure in the Senate, he served as Secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference.

==Presidential campaign, illness and death==
Beginning in January 1952, McMahon was mentioned as a possible candidate in the 1952 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but he vacillated over whether he was actually running or not. His campaign slogan was to be, &quot;The Man is McMahon&quot;, and his main campaign platform was the ensuring of global peace through strength of atomic weaponry. Then in March 1952 he fell ill and spent a week at Bethesda Naval Hospital; his condition would be determined to be lung cancer. From his sickbed, he sent a message to the Democratic state convention in Hartford, Connecticut saying that if elected president, he would tell the Atomic Energy Commission to manufacture thousands of hydrogen bombs. By the time of the 1952 Democratic National Convention in July, he was too weak to be considered an actual candidate, but the delegation from Connecticut initially cast their 16 votes for him as a symbolic gesture.

Brien McMahon served in the United States Senate until his death at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 1952, at age 48. His obituary was given front page, above the fold treatment in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. More than four years remained in his second Senate term.

Brien McMahon is buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Norwalk.

==Legacy and honors==
A commemorative stamp honoring Brien McMahon and his role in opening the way to peaceful uses of atomic energy was issued by the United States on July 28, 1962, at Norwalk, Connecticut. The stamp features a portrait of McMahon facing a rendition of an atomic symbol.

Brien McMahon High School, in Norwalk, is named after him. Brien McMahon Hall, a residence hall at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, also bears his name.

Footage of McMahon is included in the 1982 documentary &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; giving a speech urging a reasoned response to the acquisition of atomic weapons contrasting with the more McCarthyite speeches of Republican Senators Owen Brewster, Richard Nixon and Democratic Representative Lloyd Bentsen.

<text>Michael Joseph Riley (born July 6, 1953) is an American football coach who was most recently the head coach of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League (USFL). He has previously served as the head coach of two college football programs: Oregon State (1997–1998, 2003–2014) and Nebraska (2015–2017). Riley has also been the head coach of teams in four different professional leagues: the Canadian Football League (CFL), World League of American Football (WLAF), National Football League (NFL), and Alliance of American Football (AAF). He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in the 1970s.

==Early life and playing career==
Born in Wallace, Idaho, Riley is the eldest of three sons of Bud and Mary (Shumaker) Riley. Bud was from a small town western Alabama (Guin, AL), served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and had played college football at the University of Idaho in Moscow under head coach Dixie Howell, a hall of famer as a player at Alabama. After graduation, Bud worked for a mining company in Wallace and was asked by town leaders to coach at the high school; Mary was from nearby Mullan, where her parents, Mike and Mary Shumaker, ran a hotel. The family of four, now with middle brother Ed, moved from Wallace down to Lewiston in 1959, where Bud was the head coach at Lewiston High School for three seasons.

They moved up to Moscow in 1962, when Bud became a collegiate assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Idaho, under new head coach Dee Andros. Youngest brother Pete was born while the family lived in Moscow. After three seasons on the Palouse, Andros was hired at Oregon State in 1965 and Bud joined his first staff in Corvallis and stayed for eight seasons, first as the secondary coach and later as defensive coordinator. Bud went on to become a head coach in the CFL.

Riley had a peripatetic youth and spent his first 11+ years in northern Idaho, but considers Corvallis his hometown. He arrived in the spring of 1965, near the end of sixth grade, and stayed through high school.

===High school===
Riley was a hometown hero in Corvallis from his athletic days at Corvallis High School, where he led the Spartans as the starting quarterback to consecutive state title games in 1969 and 1970, both played in Corvallis at OSU&#x27;s Parker Stadium. Corvallis High School had narrowly won the early season matchup in 1969, but came up well short against Medford in the A-1 state championship, 27–0.

They avenged the loss to the Black Tornado the following year in the regular season 28–14, and again in the AAA state final, 21–10, with left-handed option quarterback Riley throwing two touchdown passes in the second quarter to build a 21–3 lead at halftime. He completed five of nine passes for 76 yards; prior to the final, Riley had thrown only 41 times in 11 games, with 23 completions (and ten wins). He was a three-sport athlete at CHS, also lettering in basketball and baseball.

===College===
Riley graduated from CHS in 1971 and opted not to play his college football in the Pac-8, but for the Alabama Crimson Tide in the SEC under head coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant. He had family connections to the state and school: his father was born and raised in Guin and his uncle, Hayden Riley, was Alabama&#x27;s assistant athletic director, head baseball coach (1970–79), and the former head basketball coach (1960–68). (Mike&#x27;s cousin, Major Ogilvie, became a star running back for the Tide in the late 1970s; Ogilvie&#x27;s mother Peggy was one of Bud Riley&#x27;s five sisters.) In his four seasons at Alabama as a reserve defensive back, the Tide won four Southeastern Conference (SEC) titles and the 1973 UPI (Coaches Poll) national championship, though they lost the 1973 Sugar Bowl to Notre Dame on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Until 1974, the final Coaches Poll was released before the bowl games.

==Coaching career==
Riley began his coaching career immediately after his playing days ended, first as a graduate assistant at California in 1975, and then as a graduate assistant at Whitworth in Spokane, where he received his master&#x27;s in physical education.

In 1977, he was hired as the defensive coordinator and secondary coach at Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon. During his stay at Linfield he assisted head coach Ad Rutschman&#x27;s Wildcats to a six-year record of 52–7–1, which included five conference titles and an undefeated NAIA Division II championship season in 1982.

===CFL===
Riley was hired as an assistant coach in the Canadian Football League in 1983 with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and was a part of their 1984 Grey Cup championship team.

Hired as the Bombers&#x27; head coach at age 33, Riley reportedly became the youngest head coach in CFL history in 1987 at Winnipeg but in fact was three years older than Bud Grant, who was 29 when he was hired as Winnipeg&#x27;s head coach in January 1957 (Grant had turned 30 by the time he coached his first game that summer). Riley led the Blue Bombers from 1987 to 1990 and won two Grey Cups during his tenure.

===WLAF===
He also coached the San Antonio Riders of the defunct WLAF. He was intended to stay on as the Riders attempted to transition to the CFL (as the San Antonio Texans) for the 1993 CFL season, but the team folded before it could begin playing as a CFL team.

===USC===

Riley returned to the college ranks in 1993 when USC head coach John Robinson offered him the position of offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach; he later became assistant head coach. The &quot;Mesa Tribune&quot; named him the league&#x27;s top assistant coach in 1993 after leading the Trojan offense to record setting numbers. USC quarterback Rob Johnson set numerous Pac-10 and NCAA records under Riley&#x27;s tutelage and later became a fourth-round NFL Draft pick. &quot;He&#x27;s a player&#x27;s coach, who gets the most out of you by treating you like normal&quot;, Johnson later said.

Riley remained at USC through the 1996 season, helping the Trojans to post-season victories in the Freedom, Cotton, and Rose Bowls. USC won an outright league title, shared another, and finished second once.

===Oregon State===
Riley was hired as the head coach at Oregon State in 1997 to replace Jerry Pettibone, who had resigned at the end of the 1996 season. Riley&#x27;s initial contract was a five-year deal at $185,000 per year. In the Beavers first season under Riley, they posted a record of 3–8. This was a difficult season for Riley as he attempted to run his NFL-style offense with players recruited by Pettibone to run the wishbone triple-option. The 1998 season was a big step in the right direction, with the Beavers posting a 5–6 record, their best record since 1971. Two of the six losses were by a single point, to Washington and California in back-to-back games late in the season. This was followed by a last-minute loss to a highly ranked UCLA team. The 1998 season was capped off by a double-overtime 44–41 victory over the rival Oregon Ducks in the Civil War game.

Although his first stint with the Beavers only lasted two seasons, Riley is considered by many to have laid the foundation for the success of the Beavers in the years to come. The 1999 team, led by Dennis Erickson and built around players Riley recruited, posted a 7–5 record and earned a trip to the Oahu Bowl, which ended a streak of 28 straight losing seasons.

===NFL===
In January 1999, Riley left the Beavers to become the head coach of the San Diego Chargers of the NFL, signing a five-year deal at $750,000 per year. Riley coached the Chargers from 1999 to 2001, with a record of 14–34. In 2000, the Chargers had their worst season; they went 1–15, with their only win on a last-second field goal against the Kansas City Chiefs. Riley&#x27;s last game was indicative of his last season, as the Chargers played well, but one poor play turned the tide. The 2001 Chargers ended their 5–11 season with a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, after Doug Flutie passed for 377 yards and drove for the tying field goal with 16 seconds remaining, but poor special teams play led to a long Seahawks kick return and subsequently a 54-yard winning field goal.

Riley was fired as head coach of the Chargers after three seasons and was an assistant coach with the New Orleans Saints in 2002. He was offered the Alabama job in December 2002 after Dennis Franchione left for Texas A&amp;M. Riley was also under consideration for the UCLA job during that period.

===Return to Oregon State ===
After spending the 2002 season with the New Orleans Saints, Riley returned to Corvallis to become the head coach at Oregon State in 2003 following Erickson&#x27;s departure to become the head coach of San Francisco 49ers of the NFL. Riley agreed to a seven-year contract that started at $625,000 per year and increased incrementally to $950,000 in year seven.

Continuing on their new success, the Beavers won bowl games in 2003 and 2004 before having a down year in 2005.

After starting the 2006 season 2–3, the Beavers went 9–4 on the regular season, including an upset of #3 USC in Corvallis. The Beavers completed their impressive season with a win over Missouri in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, ending their season with a 10–4 record.

In 2007, the Beavers again started 2–3 and finished 8–4 on the regular season, including an upset of #2 Cal in Berkeley. The Beavers finished the year 9–4 with a win in the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco over the Maryland Terrapins.

In 2008, Riley&#x27;s Beavers knocked off #1-ranked USC 27–21 at Reser Stadium. The Beavers went into the Civil War with a chance to reach the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 champions but were defeated by Oregon, 65–38, and instead accepted another invitation to the third place Sun Bowl, where they beat Pittsburgh in a defensive struggle, 3–0.

Though winless in bowl games as a player, Riley had a 6–2 NCAA football bowl record as a head coach through the 2013 season, having won the 2003 Las Vegas Bowl, 2004 Insight Bowl, 2006 Sun Bowl, 2007 Emerald Bowl, 2008 Sun Bowl, and 2013 Hawaii Bowl. Riley was a combined 9–2 in bowl games as a head or assistant coach. In the 2009 Las Vegas Bowl, the Beavers lost to the BYU Cougars of the Mountain West Conference.

In Riley&#x27;s second stint at Oregon State, the Beavers produced four NFL quarterbacks, Sean Mannion, Sean Canfield, Matt Moore, and Derek Anderson.

Following the 2009 season, Riley was rumored to be up for the USC vacancy created by the resignation of Pete Carroll. Those rumors were put to rest when Riley signed a three-year extension at OSU through the 2019 season.

During the 2012 season, Riley snatched his 75th career win surpassing Lon Stiner as Oregon State&#x27;s all-time winningest coach. Riley completed his second stint at Oregon State with an 85–66 () record in a dozen seasons. His 93 wins overall in 14 seasons at OSU are the most in school history.

===Nebraska===
On December 4, 2014, Riley was named head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

In his first season as head coach at Nebraska, Riley&#x27;s Cornhuskers completed a 5–7 regular season (their first losing season since 2007) with numerous last second losses; notable among these was the Huskers&#x27; first game under Riley, wherein they lost to BYU, 33–28, on a last-second Hail Mary pass from the Cougars&#x27; backup quarterback, Tanner Mangum, to wide receiver Mitch Mathews (a loss which snapped Nebraska&#x27;s streak of 29 consecutive home opener wins). Despite their losing season, however, the Cornhuskers were still invited to a post-season bowl game due to a lack of enough eligible teams to fill all bowl slots and the team high academic progress rate (APR). The Cornhuskers defeated the UCLA Bruins in the 2015 Foster Farms Bowl, finishing the season 6–7. 2016 saw improvement as the team began the season with seven straight wins and reached number 7 in the AP Poll, and finished 9–4 overall after losses to Wisconsin, Ohio State, Iowa, and Tennessee in the Music City Bowl. The Huskers significantly regressed in 2017, going on a four-game losing streak to finish 4–8, the school&#x27;s worst record since 1961. The last three of those losses saw Nebraska surrender at least 50 points. Riley was fired following the season.

===Second return to Oregon State===
On December 7, 2017, it was announced that Riley would return to Oregon State to be the assistant head coach under newly hired Oregon State head coach Jonathan Smith, who had been both a player (1998) and a graduate assistant coach (2003) during Riley&#x27;s first and second tenures as head coach at Oregon State.

===San Antonio Commanders===
In June 2018, Riley was named the head coach of the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football.

===Seattle Dragons===
On June 6, 2019, Riley was named the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for Seattle&#x27;s new XFL team, the Seattle Dragons. He missed the first three games of the season for personal reasons.

=== New Jersey Generals ===
On January 6, 2022, Riley was named the Head coach and General manager for the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. On January 1, 2024, it was announced the Generals would not be a part of the UFL Merger.

<text>Umberto Antonio Tozzi (; born 4 March 1952) is an Italian pop and rock singer and songwriter. Throughout his career, he has sold over 70 million records in different languages internationally, and his biggest international hits are:
&quot;Stella Stai&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Tu&quot; and &quot;Ti Amo&quot;.

==Biography==
Tozzi was born on 4 March 1952 in Turin, Italy. He is the second son of Nicola Tozzi, a police officer originally from Vico del Gargano, and Immacolata from Montesarchio. They immigrated to Turin in 1945.

In 1968, at the age of 16, Umberto Tozzi joined &#x27;Off Sound&#x27;, one of the many groups that performed in small venues around Turin. In Milan, he met Adriano Pappalardo, with whom he formed a 13-piece band and began a large-scale Italian tour.

In 1974, Tozzi had his first success as a songwriter, with the song &quot;Un Corpo, un&#x27;anima&quot; (&quot;One Body, One Soul&quot;), co-written with Damiano Dattoli and performed by Wess and Dori Ghezzi. It appeared on &quot;Canzonissima&quot;, an Italian music programme running from 1956 to 1974.

In 1976, he released his first album, &quot;Donna Amante Mia&quot; (&quot;Woman, My Lover&quot;), which contained the single &quot;Io Camminerò&quot; (&quot;I Will Walk&quot;), which was sung with great success by Fausto Leali. In 1977, &quot;Ti Amo&quot;, one of Tozzi&#x27;s most famous songs, was released. It stayed at number one on the Italian song charts for seven months and went on to become an international success throughout continental Europe. It also achieved decent success in the Americas and Australia, primarily in nightclubs. The single was awarded a gold record award in Australia, despite the fact that it only made number 25 on the charts there in late 1979. In 1978 he released &quot;Tu&quot;, another hit in Italy, and held an Australian tour, which was organized by the Italo-Australian promoter Duane Zigliotto and concluded at the Sydney Opera House with two full house concerts.

The following year Tozzi recorded one of his most famous songs, &quot;Gloria&quot;, which became a major hit in Italy in 1979 and 1980. Jonathan King wrote English lyrics for the song, which became popular in the UK as well in 1979, and was sung and recorded by the English singer Elkie Brooks in 1980. A cover version of the song by the American singer Laura Branigan in 1982 caused the song to grow in popularity in the US as well. Branigan worked with the arranger and keyboardist of Tozzi&#x27;s own version, Greg Mathieson, to give the song what she called &quot;an American kick.&quot; The song reached the top of the charts, reached gold and platinum status in several countries, and stayed on the US pop charts for 36 weeks.

By late 1980 he released &quot;Stella Stai&quot;, another one of his major hits. In the early 1980s, he released an album called &quot;Tozzi&quot;, which he recorded at a concert with a band of American musicians, and was his first live recording. Soon after, the Latin Group Menudo recorded the Spanish version of &quot;Stella Stai&quot;, entitled &quot;Claridad&quot;, which made it one of the highest-selling records in the whole of Latin America.

After a period of absence from the music scene, Tozzi returned in 1987 and won the Sanremo Music Festival with the song &quot;Si Può Dare Di Più&quot; (&quot;More can be given&quot;), which he sang with Gianni Morandi and Enrico Ruggeri. In 1987 he also released &quot;Gente Di Mare&quot; (&quot;People of the Sea&quot;), which he performed with Raf at Eurovision, and won third place. In 1988, Tozzi released his second live album, &quot;The Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

In the 1990s, Tozzi recorded several more songs such as &quot;Gli Altri Siamo Noi&quot; (&quot;We Are the Others&quot;), the album &quot;Equivocando&quot; (&quot;Misunderstanding&quot;), &quot;Il Grido&quot; (&quot;The Outcry&quot;) and &quot;Aria e Cielo&quot; (&quot;Air and Sky&quot;). He also released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;Le Mie Canzoni&quot; (&quot;My Songs&quot;).

In 2000 and 2005, he performed &quot;Un&#x27;altra Vita&quot; (&quot;Another Life&quot;) and &quot;Le Parole&quot; (&quot;The Words&quot;) at the Sanremo Music Festival. Between the two events, he also released a duet with the French singer Lena Ka of his classic &quot;Ti Amo&quot; as &quot;Ti Amo (Rien Que des Mots)&quot;. Tozzi released another greatest hits compilation, a 2-disc set entitled &quot;The Best of&quot;, and another single, &quot;E Non Volo&quot;. In January 2009 he released the single &quot;Cerco ancora te&quot;, composed by Emilio Munda and Matteo Gaggioli.

In 2013, his re-edited version of &quot;Gloria&quot;, sung in its original Italian, was placed by Martin Scorsese onto the soundtrack of the 2014 Academy Award nominated blockbuster, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;.

Throughout his career, Tozzi has sold over 70 million records in different languages internationally.

<text>A township, in the context of New Jersey local government, refers to one of five &quot;types&quot; and one of eleven &quot;forms&quot; of municipal government. As a political entity, a township in New Jersey is a full-fledged municipality, on par with any town, city, borough, or village. They collect property taxes and provide services such as maintaining roads, garbage collection, water, sewer, schools, police and fire protection. The township form of local government is used by 27% of New Jersey municipalities; however, slightly over 50% of the state&#x27;s population resides within them.

Townships in New Jersey differ from townships elsewhere in the United States. In many states, townships can be an intermediate form of government, between county government and municipalities that are subordinate parts of the township, with different government responsibilities allocated at each level. In New Jersey, there are no subordinate municipalities located within a township, as townships are equivalent to all other forms of local municipalities.

Municipalities in New Jersey may be classified into one of five &quot;types&quot;, of which townships are one. Townships may retain the township &quot;form&quot; of government, or adopt one of the modern forms of government, which are not restricted to a particular type of municipality. In New Jersey, a municipality&#x27;s name (such as X Township) is not necessarily an indication of its form of government.

In New Jersey, the township form of government consists of a three to five-member township committee usually elected at-large in partisan elections. At its organization meeting, held after an election, the committee selects one of its elected members to serve as mayor and preside at meetings. The other members of the township committee serve as commissioners of various township departments, overseeing the work of those areas along with overall legislative issues. Some mayors in this form of government also oversee specific departments. The mayor in this form of government is primarily ceremonial and has the same power as other township committee members. The mayor does hold the powers vested in all mayors under state law One township committee member is elected deputy mayor each year. Some towns with this form of government rotate the mayor&#x27;s office each year, while others elect the same mayor for 2–3 consecutive years. Out of the 240 townships in the state, the township form of government is used by 140. On road signs, township is often abbreviated TWP or Twp. Some official documents abbreviate it as &quot;Twsp.&quot;

==History==
Historically, a variety of legislation has been passed by the state legislature that has defined and refined the township &quot;form&quot; of municipal government:

The Township Act of 1798 was the first state legislation to incorporate municipalities. The government defined was a form of direct democracy, similar to the New England town meeting, in which the vote was available to all white males, at least 21 years old, who were citizens of New Jersey, and residents of the township for at least six months; and who paid taxes in the township, or who owned land, or rented a home in the township for a rent of at least five dollars a year. A group of five freeholders was elected to one-year terms on the Township Committee, which was responsible to oversee the expenditure of revenue in between town meetings.

The Township Act of 1899 abolished the town meeting and strengthened the role of the Township Committee, which was initially set at three and amended to allow for expansion to five members. Members were elected for staggered three-year terms.

The Home Rule Act of 1917 legally defined the term &quot;municipality&quot; and recognized five &quot;types&quot; of government: borough, township, city, town, and village and granted each equal legal standing.

The Township Act of 1989 simplified the much-amended Act of 1899. It retains a three or five member township committee serving staggered terms, whose members are generally elected at-large. The committee elects a mayor from among its members to serve a one-year term. Partisan elections are allowed under this law. Voters may initiate a referendum to change the membership to consist of either 3 or 5 members. While many township committees directly supervise the operation of their municipality, the revised act allows the committee to delegate all or a portion of its responsibilities to an appointed municipal administrator.

A number of municipalities changed to the Township type, or the Township form of government, between 1979 and 1982. A federal law, &quot;The State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972&quot; provided funding to the states to be divided between state and municipal governments. In 1981, states were removed from the program and the law was amended to provide direct grants to the most popular form of local government in the United States - townships. In Essex County alone, 11 municipal governments changed their form or name to take advantage of the program.

<text>George E. Pake (April 1, 1924 – March 4, 2004) was a physicist and research executive primarily known for helping found Xerox PARC.

== Early life ==
Pake was raised in Kent, Ohio. His father was an English instructor at Kent State University. His mother was a schoolteacher.

Pake was exempted from service in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II due to scoliosis. He earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and his doctorate in physics at Harvard University in 1948.

== Career ==
Much of his early research at Harvard University focused on the topic of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. There, he discovered the multiplet structure produced by the dipolar coupling of two nuclear spins. In his honor, this multiplet is now known as the Pake doublet and forms the basis for NMR-based inter-atomic distance measurements and molecular structure determination.

After four years as a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Pake became the head of the physics department at age 28. He later went on to become provost of the university from 1962 to 1970 before leaving to serve as founding director of Xerox PARC.

Pake served on the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (1965-1969). He was president of the American Physical Society in 1977.

PARC assembled a first-rate collection of research talent, especially in the area of computer science. During Pake&#x27;s years running Xerox PARC, the research center invented the laser printer and pioneered the use of a computer &quot;desktop&quot; which functioned by clicking on &quot;icons.&quot; 
This has since become the computer industry standard.

Despite advocacy by Pake, the Xerox Corporation never chose to open a personal computer division. Pake left Xerox in 1986 to direct the nonprofit Institute for Research on Learning in Palo Alto. He remained director emeritus until the time of his death.

Late in life, Pake began writing two different books, both with the collaborator Andrew Szanton. Pake&#x27;s death, of heart failure on March 4, 2004, in Tucson, Arizona, interrupted both book projects.

== Awards ==
In 1986, Pake was awarded the illustrious IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute for recognition of his leadership in the field of technology and innovation. Pake was also a recipient of the National Medal of Science in 1987 and continued to visit PARC long after his 1986 retirement from Xerox.

== George E. Pake Prize ==
Since 1984, the American Physical Society has been awarding the George E. Pake Prize, endowed in 1983 by the Xerox Corporation, to recognize outstanding work by physicists combining original research accomplishments with leadership in the management of research or development in industry.

== Personal life ==
Pake married Marjorie Semon on May 31, 1947; they had four children: Warren, Bruce, Cathie and Steve.

<text>John Wright (born 1945) is a former New Zealand politician. He was a member of parliament from 1996 to 2002, representing the Alliance. Before entering Parliament he owned the Port-a-Loo company.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Wright was born in Ashburton in 1945. He grew up on a farm in Ashburton before becoming a panel beater and mechanic by trade. He later formed his own recycling and promotions business. He was then a sales and marketing manager for a plastics manufacturer.

He was a founding member and president of the Waimakariri Ratepayers and Residents Association. He was also a committee member of the North Christchurch Jaycees and Richmond Primary School Parent–teacher association.

===Political career===


Wright joined the Social Credit Party in 1977 and was a vice-president of the party from 1979 until 1986. He was part of the conference in 1985 that turned Social Credit into the Democratic Party. He was the Democratic candidate for in the 1990 election. In 1991, he became leader of the Democrats.

When the Democrats joined with three other parties to found the Alliance, Wright was active in building up the new organisation. He stood unsuccessfully for the Alliance in the Rangiora seat in the 1993 election, and then in the 1994 Selwyn by-election. In the 1996 election, the first conducted under the MMP system, Wright was elected to Parliament as a list MP, having been ranked in fourth place on the Alliance list. By this time, he was leader of the Democrats. He returned to Parliament in the 1999 election, and when the Alliance formed a coalition government with the larger Labour Party, Wright was appointed to a Parliamentary Undersecretary&#x27;s role in the Economic Development, Revenue, Regional Development and Racing portfolios. He became the first (and only) Social Creditor to be part of the Executive.

In 2002, the Alliance began to collapse, with a rift opening between Parliamentary leader Jim Anderton and the organisational wing, led by Matt McCarten. When Anderton left the Alliance to establish a new party, the Progressive Coalition, the Democrats (including Wright) followed him. In the 2002 election, Wright was ranked in fourth place on the Progressive list, behind Anderton, Matt Robson, and new Democratic Party leader Grant Gillon. but as the party only won enough votes for two seats, Wright did not remain in Parliament.

Later, when the Democrats opted to split from the Progressives, Wright opposed the decision. He eventually opted to leave the Democrats in order to remain with the Progressives, and was joined by Gillon. He remained a member of the Progressives until the movement&#x27;s dissolution in January 2012. After he failed to retain his seat at the 2002 and 2005 elections, Wright was forced to take on a job at a panel beater&#x27;s shop until he was appointed a Member of the Transit board in 2005. During this time Wright had commented to Tracy Watkins, a Fairfax Media Reporter that although he had a cabinet full of $1000 suits the only clothes he actually needed were a $12 pair of Warehouse overalls. As of 2015, Wright no longer sits on the merged NZ Transport Agency Board and his current activities are unknown.

<doc id="1081905" wikidata="Q267714" url="?curid=1081905" title="Overhead valve engine">
<text>An overhead valve engine, abbreviated (OHV) and sometimes called a pushrod engine, is a piston engine whose valves are located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber. This contrasts with flathead (or &quot;sidevalve&quot;) engines, where the valves were located below the combustion chamber in the engine block. 

Although an overhead camshaft (OHC) engine also has overhead valves, the common usage of the term &quot;overhead valve engine&quot; is limited to engines where the camshaft is located in the engine block. In these traditional OHV engines, the motion of the camshaft is transferred using pushrods (hence the term &quot;pushrod engine&quot;) and rocker arms to operate the valves at the top of the engine. However, some designs have the camshaft in the cylinder head but still sit below or alongside the valves (the Ford CVH and Opel CIH are good examples), so they can essentially be considered overhead valve designs.

Some early intake-over-exhaust engines used a hybrid design combining elements of both side-valves and overhead valves.

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===
The first internal combustion engines were based on steam engines and therefore used slide valves. This was the case for the first Otto engine, which was first successfully run in 1876. As internal combustion engines began to develop separately to steam engines, poppet valves became increasingly common.

Beginning with the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen, several cars and motorcycles used inlet valve(s) located in the cylinder head, however these valves were vacuum-actuated (&quot;atmospheric&quot;) rather than driven by a camshaft as with typical OHV engines. The exhaust valve(s) were driven by a camshaft, but were located in the engine block as with side-valve engines.

The 1894 prototype Diesel engine used overhead poppet valves actuated by a camshaft, pushrods and rocker arms, therefore becoming the first OHV engines. In 1896, U.S. patent 563,140 was taken out by William F. Davis for an OHV engine with liquid coolant used to cool the cylinder head, but no working model was built.

=== Production OHV engines ===
In 1898, bicycle manufacturer Walter Lorenzo Marr in the United States built a motorised tricycle powered by a single-cylinder OHV engine. Marr was hired by Buick (then named &quot;Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company&quot;) from 1899–1902, where the overhead valve engine design was further refined. This engine employed pushrod-actuated rocker arms, which in turn opened poppet valves parallel to the pistons. Marr returned to Buick in 1904 (having built a small quantity of the Marr Auto-Car, with one of the first known engines to use an overhead camshaft design), the same year that Buick received a patent for an overhead valve engine design. In 1904, the world&#x27;s first production OHV engine was released in the Buick Model B. The engine was a flat-twin design with two valves per cylinder. The engine was very successful for Buick, with the company selling 750 such cars in 1905, and the OHV engine has powered almost all Buick automobiles since then.

Several other manufacturers began to produce OHV engines, such as the 1906–1912 Wright Brothers &quot;Vertical 4-Cylinder Engine&quot;. In 1911, Chevrolet joined Buick in almost exclusive use of OHV engines. However, flathead &quot;side-valve&quot; engines remained commonplace in the U.S. until the mid-to-late 1950s, when they began to be phased out for OHV engines.

=== Overhead camshaft engines ===

The first overhead camshaft (OHC) engine dates back to 1902, in the Marr; however, use of this design was mostly limited to high-performance cars for many decades. OHC engines slowly became more common from the 1950s to the 1990s, and by the start of the 21st century, the majority of automotive engines (except for some North American V8 engines) used an OHC design.

At the 1994 Indianapolis 500 motor race, Team Penske entered a car powered by the custom-built Mercedes-Benz 500I pushrod engine. Due to a loophole in the rules, the pushrod engine was allowed to use a larger displacement and higher boost pressure, significantly increasing its power output compared to the OHC engines used by other teams. Team Penske qualified in pole position and won the race by a large margin.

In the early 21st century, several pushrod V8 engines from General Motors and Chrysler used cylinder deactivation to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. In 2008, the first production pushrod engine to use variable valve timing was introduced in the Dodge Viper (fourth generation).

== Design ==
OHV engines have several advantages compared with OHC engines:
* Smaller overall packaging: The cam-in-block design of an OHV engine results in a smaller overall size, compared with an equivalent OHC engine, which can have some advantages in center of gravity and hood height in V-engine designs.
* Simpler camshaft drive system: OHV engines have a less complex drive system for the camshaft than OHC engines. Most OHC engines drive the camshaft or camshafts using a timing belt, a chain, or multiple chains. These systems require the use of tensioners, which add complexity. In contrast, an OHV engine has the camshaft positioned close to the crankshaft, which may be driven by a much shorter chain or even direct gear connection. However, this is somewhat negated by a more complex valvetrain requiring pushrods.
* Simpler lubrication system: The lubrication requirements for OHV cylinder heads are much lower, as they typically have a single camshaft within the block, where an OHC engine can have two per bank of cylinders, requiring oil passages through the cylinder head. OHV heads only need lubrication for the rocker arms at the pushrod end, trunnion, and rocker tip. This lubrication is typically provided through the hollow pushrods themselves rather than a dedicated lubrication system in the head. The reduced lubrication requirements can also mean that a smaller, lower-capacity oil pump is used.

Compared with OHC engines, OHV engines have the following disadvantages:
* Limited engine speeds: Although OHV engines have simpler drive systems for the camshaft, there are a greater number of moving parts in the valvetrain (i.e., the lifters, pushrods, and rockers). Inertia from these valvetrain parts makes OHV engines more susceptible to valve float at high engine speeds (RPM).
* Constraints on valve quantity and location: In OHV engines, the size and shape of the intake ports as well as the position of the valves are limited by the pushrods and the need to accommodate them in the head casting. As a result, it is rare for an OHV engine to have more than two valves per cylinder, while OHC engines often have four, allowing for higher rates of combustion and exhaust.

<doc id="1081926" wikidata="Q1029421" url="?curid=1081926" title="Child prostitution">
<text>Child prostitution is prostitution involving a child, and it is a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children. The term normally refers to prostitution of a minor, or person under the legal age of consent.
In most jurisdictions, child prostitution is illegal as part of general prohibition on prostitution.

Child prostitution usually manifests in the form of sex trafficking, in which a child is kidnapped or tricked into becoming involved in the sex trade, or survival sex, in which the child engages in sexual activities to procure basic essentials such as food and shelter. Prostitution of children is commonly associated with child pornography, and they often overlap. Some people travel to foreign countries to engage in child sex tourism. Research suggests that there may be as many as 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide. The practice is most widespread in South America and Asia, but prostitution of children exists globally, in undeveloped countries as well as developed. Most of the children involved with prostitution are girls, despite an increase in the number of young boys in the trade.

All member countries of the United Nations have committed to prohibiting child prostitution, either under the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Various campaigns and organizations have been created to try to stop the practice.

==Definitions==
Several definitions have been proposed for prostitution of children. The United Nations defines it as &quot;the act of engaging or offering the services of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person&quot;. The Convention on the Rights of the Child&#x27;s Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography defines the practice as &quot;the act of obtaining, procuring or offering the services of a child or inducing a child to perform sexual acts for any form of compensation or reward&quot;. Both emphasize that the child is a victim of exploitation, even if apparent consent is given. The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, (Convention No 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO) describes it as the &quot;use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution&quot;.

According to the International Labour Office in Geneva, prostitution of children and child pornography are two primary forms of child sexual exploitation, which often overlap. The former is sometimes used to describe the wider concept of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC). It excludes other identifiable manifestations of CSEC, such as commercial sexual exploitation through child marriage, domestic child labor, and the trafficking of children for sexual purposes.

The terminology applied to the practice is a subject of dispute. The United States Department of Justice states, &quot;The term itself implies the idea of choice, when in fact that is not the case.&quot; Groups that oppose the practice believe that the terms &quot;child prostitution&quot; and &quot;child prostitute&quot; carry problematic connotations because children are generally not expected to be able to make informed decisions about prostitution. As an alternative, they use the terms &quot;prostituted children&quot; and &quot;the commercial sexual exploitation of children&quot;. Other groups use the term &quot;child sex worker&quot; to imply that the children are not always &quot;passive victims&quot;.

==Causes and types==
Children are often forced by social structures and individual agents into situations in which adults take advantage of their vulnerability and sexually exploit and abuse them by selling them or selling their bodies. Structure and agency commonly combine to force a child into commercial sex: for example, the prostitution of a child frequently follows from prior sexual abuse, often in the child&#x27;s home. Many believe that the majority of prostituted children are from Southeast Asia and the majority of their clients are Western sex tourists, but sociologist Louise Brown argues that, while Westerners contribute to the growth of the industry, most of the children&#x27;s customers are Asian locals.

Prostitution of children usually occurs in environments such as brothels, bars and clubs, homes, or particular streets and areas (usually in socially run down places). According to one study, only about 10% of prostituted children have a pimp and over 45% entered the business through friends. Maureen Jaffe and Sonia Rosen from the International Child Labor Study Office write that cases vary widely:Some victims are runaways from home or State institutions, others are sold by their parents or forced or tricked into prostitution, and others are street children. Some are amateurs and others professionals. Although one tends to think first and foremost of young girls in the trade, there is an increase in the number of young boys involved in prostitution. The most disquieting cases are those children who are forced into the trade and then incarcerated. These children run the possible further risk of torture and subsequent death.Deputy Attorney General James Cole, of the United States Department of Justice, stated,Most of the victimized children who face prostitution are vulnerable children who are exploited. Many predators target runaways, sexual assault victims, and children who have been harshly neglected by their biological parents. Not only have they faced traumatic violence that affects their physical being, but become intertwined into the violent life of prostitution.

===Human trafficking===
Human trafficking is defined by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as &quot;the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation&quot;. The UNODC approximates the number of victims worldwide to be around 2.5 million. UNICEF reports that since 1982 about 30 million children have been trafficked. Trafficking for sexual slavery accounts for 79% of cases, with the majority of victims being female, of which an estimated 20% are children. Women are also often perpetrators as well.

In 2007 the UN founded United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT). In cooperation with UNICEF, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) the United Nations took a grant from the United Arab Emirates to establish UN.GIFT. UN.GIFT aims to fight human trafficking through a mutual support from its stakeholders which includes governments, businesses, and other large global actors. Their first initiative is to spread the word that human trafficking is immoral and has become a growing problem that it will take a global cooperation to cease its continuation. UN.GIFT strives to lower the demand for this exploitation and create a safe environment for potential victims.

In some cases, victims of sex trafficking are kidnapped by strangers, either by force or by being tricked into becoming involved through lies and false promises. They may also be lured through the internet, as child victims of cybersex trafficking are transported and then coerced to perform sexual acts and or raped in front of a webcam on commercialized live streams. In these incidents, consumers use cryptocurrencies and other digital technologies to hide their identities. In other cases, the children&#x27;s families allow or force them to enter the industry as a result of severe poverty. In cases where they are taken out of the country, traffickers prey on the fact that the children are often unable to understand the language of their new location and are unaware of their legal rights.

Research indicates that traffickers have a preference for females age 12 and under because young children are more easily molded into the role assigned to them and because they are assumed to be virgins, which is valuable to consumers. The girls are then made to appear older, and documents are forged as protection against law enforcement. Victims tend to share similar backgrounds, often coming from communities with high crime rates and lack of access to education. However, victimology is not limited to this, and males and females coming from various backgrounds have become involved in sex trafficking.

Psychotherapist Mary De Chesnay identifies five stages in the process of sex trafficking: vulnerability, recruitment, transportation, exploitation, and liberation. The final stage, De Chesnay writes, is rarely completed. Murder and accidental death rates are high, as are suicides, and very few trafficking victims are rescued or escape.

===Survival sex===
The other primary form of prostitution of children is survival sex. The US Department of Justice states:

A study commissioned by UNICEF and Save the Children and headed by sociologist Annjanette Rosga conducted research on prostitution of children in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rosga reported that poverty was a strong contributing factor. She stated,The global sex trade is as much a product of everyday people struggling to survive in dire economic straits as it is an organized crime problem. Attacking the crime and not the poverty is treating the symptom but not the disease...It&#x27;s not uncommon for girls to know what they&#x27;re entering into, and to enter voluntarily to some degree. Maybe they think they&#x27;ll be different and able to escape, or maybe they&#x27;d rather take the risk than feel powerless staying at home in poverty.Jaffe and Rosen disagree and argue that poverty alone does not often force children into prostitution, as it does not exist in a large scale in several impoverished societies. Rather, a number of external influences, such as poor family situations and domestic violence, factor into the problem.

Prostitution of children in the form of survival sex occurs in both undeveloped and developed countries. In Asia, underage girls sometimes work in brothels to support their families. In Sri Lanka, parents will more often have their sons prostitute themselves rather than their daughters, as the society places more weight on sexual purity among females than males. Jaffe and Rosen write that prostitution of children in North America often results from &quot;economic considerations, domestic violence and abuse, family disintegration and drug addiction&quot;. In Canada, a young man was convicted of charges relating to the prostitution of a 15-year-old girl online in 2012; he had encouraged her to prostitute herself as a means of making money, kept all of her earnings, and threatened her with violence if she did not continue.

In the United States, where many prostituted children are homeless and runaways, the view of adolescent prostitution as primarily driven by pimp-exploiters and other &quot;sex traffickers&quot; was challenged by SNRG-NYC in their 2008 New York City study which interviewed over 300 under-age prostitutes and found that only 10% reported having pimps. A 2012 study done in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by the same group incorporated an extended qualitative ethnographic component that looked specifically at the relationship between pimps and adolescents engaged with street based sex markets. This study found the percentage of adolescents who had pimps to be only 14% and that those relationships were typically far more complex, mutual, and companionate than has been reported by social service providers, not-for-profits, and much of the news media. On the other hand, youths&#x27; status as being a runaway, homeless, or in the foster care system greatly increases their likelihood of being involved in commercial sex, according to the National Runaway Switchboard and the New York State Office of Children, with one-third of runaway youths in America being lured into prostitution within 48 hours on the streets.

==Consequences==

===Treatment of prostituted children===
Prostituted children are often forced to work in hazardous environments without proper hygiene. They face threats of violence and are sometimes raped and beaten. Researchers Robin E. Clark, Judith Freeman Clark, and Christine A. Adamec write that they &quot;suffer a great deal of abuse, unhappiness, and poor health&quot; in general. For example, Derrick Jensen, an environmental activist known for his critiques of modern civilization, reports that female sex trafficking victims from Nepal are broken in&#x27; through a process of rapes and beatings, and then rented out up to thirty-five times per night for one to two dollars per man&quot;. Another example involved mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Lucknow, and Gorakhpur. One victim left Nepal at the age of 14 and was sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly circumcised. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were castrated, before escaping and returning to Nepal.

Criminologist Ronald Flowers writes that prostitution of children and child pornography are closely linked; up to one in three prostituted children have been involved in pornography, often through films or literature. Runaway teenagers, he states, are frequently used for &quot;porn flicks&quot; and photographs. In addition to pornography, Flowers writes that, &quot;Children caught up in this dual world of sexual exploitation are often victims of sexual assaults, sexual perversions, sexually transmitted diseases, and inescapable memories of sexual misuse and bodies that have been compromised, brutalized, and left forever tarnished.&quot;

===Physical and psychological effects===

According to Humanium, an NGO that opposes the prostitution of children, the practice causes injuries such as &quot;vaginal tearing, physical after-effects of torture, pain, infection, or unwanted pregnancy&quot;. As clients seldom take precautions against the spread of HIV, prostituted children face a high risk of contracting the disease, and the majority of them in certain locations contract it. Other sexually transmitted diseases pose a threat as well, such as syphilis and herpes. High levels of tuberculosis have also been found among prostituted children. These illnesses are often fatal.

Children are often medicated to make them appear more mature. Corticosteroids like Oradexon (a glucocorticoid) are commonly provided to prostituted children in places such as Bangladesh, to help make them look and feel more robust (&quot;i.e.&quot; less frail) and healthier, which in turn helps to keep them going. When use of these drugs is not monitored through bloodwork by a healthcare professional they can cause diabetes and high blood pressure, can weaken the immune system leaving patients more susceptible to illnesses, and can be highly psychologically addictive. In India, some girls are injected with oxytocin to make their breasts grow faster.

Former prostituted children often deal with psychological trauma, including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Other psychological effects include anger, insomnia, sexual and personality confusion, inability to trust adults, and loss of confidence. Drug-related health problems included dental problems, hepatitis B and C, and serious liver and kidney problems. Other medical complications included reproductive problems and injuries from sexual assaults; physical and neurological problems from violent physical attacks; and other general health issues including respiratory problems and joint pains.

==Prohibition==

Prostitution of children is illegal under international law, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 34, states, &quot;the State shall protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, including prostitution and involvement in pornography.&quot; The convention was first held in 1989 and has been ratified by 193 countries. In 1990, the United Nations appointed a Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. Over at least the last decade, the international community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of addressing problems posed by the trafficking of children, child prostitution, and child pornography; activities that undermine the rights of children and are frequently linked to organized crime. While the legality of adult prostitution varies between different parts of the world, the prostitution of minors is illegal in most countries, and all countries have some form of restrictions against it.

There is a dispute surrounding what constitutes a prostituted child. International law defines a child as any individual below the age of 18, but a number of countries legally recognize lower ages of consent and adulthood, usually ranging from 13 to 17 years of age. In the Czech Republic, for example, prostitution is legal for children older than 14. Thus, law enforcement officers are sometimes hesitant to investigate cases because of the differences in age of consent. The laws of some countries do, however, distinguish between prostituted teenagers and prostituted children. For example, the Japanese government defines the category as referring to minors between 13 and 18. However, it is currently defined as being under the age of 18.

Consequences for offenders vary from country to country. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, all forms of prostitution are illegal, but having sexual contact with anyone under the age of 14, regardless of consent, will result in a more serious punishment than raping an adult. By contrast, Argentina&#x27;s Criminal Code criminalizes the prostitution of minors, but only sanctions those who &quot;promote or facilitate&quot; prostitution, not the client who exploits the minor. In the United States, the legal penalty for participating in the prostitution of children includes five to twenty years in prison. The FBI established &quot;Innocence Lost&quot;, a new department working to free children from prostitution, in response to the strong public reaction across the country to the news of Operation Stormy Nights, in which 23 minors were released from forced prostitution.

==Prevalence==

===Statistical summary===

Prostitution of children exists in every country, though the problem is most severe in South America and Asia. The number of prostituted children is rising in other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, and Europe. Exact statistics are difficult to obtain, and in some cases, such as that of Argentina, child prostitution is considered to be on the rise but without reliable statistics. However, it is estimated that there are around 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide.

:&quot;Note: this is a list of examples; it does not cover every country where child prostitution exists.&quot;
==Demographics==
The people who buy sex from minors are most often men who try to &quot;rationalize their sexual involvement with children.&quot;

Though most child prostitutes are girls, advocates point out that boys are also exploited, and that this is often overlooked and more strongly stigmatized. An ECPAT-USA study found that though gay, bisexual, and questioning boys were represented at higher percentage than the general population, the majority of boys in prostitution were heterosexual in sexual orientation despite typically performing homosexual acts. 

==Views==

===Public perception===
Anthropologist Heather Montgomery writes that society has a largely negative perception of prostitution of children, in part because the children are often viewed as having been abandoned or sold by their parents and families. The International Labour Organization includes the prostitution of children in its list of the &quot;worst forms of child labour&quot;. At the 1996 World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children it was called &quot;a crime against humanity&quot;, &quot;torture&quot;, and &quot;slavery&quot;. Virginia Kendall, a district judge and expert on child exploitation and human trafficking, and T. Markus Funk, an attorney and law professor, write that the subject is an emotional one and that there are various perspectives about its prevention:

Investigative journalist Julian Sher states that widespread stereotypes about the prostitution of children continued into the 1990s, when the first organized opposition arose and police officers began working to dispel common misconceptions. Criminologist Roger Matthews writes that concerns over pedophilia and child sexual abuse, as well as shifting perceptions of youth, led the public to see a sharp difference between prostitution of children and adult prostitution. While the latter is generally frowned upon, the former is seen as intolerable. Additionally, he states, children are increasingly viewed as &quot;innocent&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; and their prostitution as paramount to slavery. Through the shift in attitude, the public began to see minors involved in the sex trade as victims rather than as perpetrators of a crime, needing rehabilitation rather than punishment.

===Opposition===
Though campaigns against prostitution of children originated in the 1800s, the first mass protests against the practice occurred in the 1990s in the United States, led largely by ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism). The group, which historian Junius P. Rodriguez describes as &quot;the most significant of the campaigning groups against child prostitution&quot;, originally focused on the issue of children being exploited in Southeast Asia by Western tourists. Women&#x27;s rights groups and anti-tourism groups joined to protest the practice of sex tourism in Bangkok, Thailand. The opposition to sex tourism was spurred on by an image of a Thai youth in prostitution, published in &quot;Time&quot; and by the publication of a dictionary in the United Kingdom describing Bangkok as &quot;a place where there are a lot of prostitutes&quot;. Cultural anthropologists Susan Dewey and Patty Kelly write that though they were unable to inhibit sex tourism and rates of prostitution of children continued to rise, the groups &quot;galvanized public opinion nationally and internationally&quot; and succeeded in getting the media to cover the topic extensively for the first time. ECPAT later expanded its focus to protest child prostitution globally.

The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the creation of a number of shelters and rehabilitation programs for prostituted children, and the police began to actively investigate the issue. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) was later established by the Polaris Project as a national, toll-free hotline, available to answer calls from anywhere in the United States, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. The hotline was designed to allow callers to report tips and receive information on human trafficking.

The opposition to prostitution of children and sexual slavery spread to Europe and elsewhere, and organizations pushed for prostituted children to be recognized as victims rather than offenders. The issue remained prominent in the following years, and various campaigns and organizations continued into the 2000s and 2010s.

==History==

Prostitution of children dates to antiquity. Prepubescent boys were commonly prostituted in brothels in ancient Greece and Rome. According to Ronald Flowers, the &quot;most beautiful and highest born Egyptian maidens were forced into prostitution... and they continued as prostitutes until their first menstruation.&quot; Chinese and Indian children were commonly sold by their parents into prostitution. Parents in India sometimes dedicated their female children to the Hindu temples, where they became &quot;devadasis&quot;. Traditionally a high status in society, the devadasis were originally tasked with maintaining and cleaning the temples of the Hindu deity to which they were assigned (usually the goddess Renuka) and learning skills such as music and dancing. However, as the system evolved, their role became that of a temple prostitute, and the girls, who were &quot;dedicated&quot; before puberty, were required to prostitute themselves to upper-class men. The practice has since been outlawed but still exists.

In Europe, child prostitution flourished until the late 1800s; minors accounted for 50% of individuals involved in prostitution in Paris. A scandal in 19th-century England caused the government there to raise the age of consent. In July 1885, William Thomas Stead, editor of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, published &quot;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&quot;, four articles describing an extensive underground sex trafficking ring that reportedly sold children to adults. Stead&#x27;s reports focused on a 13-year-old girl, Eliza Armstrong, who was sold for £5 (the equivalent of around £500 in 2012), then taken to a midwife to have her virginity verified. The age of consent was raised from 13 to 16 within a week of publication. During this period, the term &quot;white slavery&quot; came to be used throughout Europe and the United States to describe prostituted children.

<text>A knish or is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish snack food consisting of a filling covered with dough that is typically baked or sometimes deep fried.

Knishes are often purchased from street vendors in urban areas with a large Jewish population, sometimes at a hot dog stand, or from a butcher shop. They are still strongly associated with New York City cuisine. 

In most traditional versions, the filling is made entirely of mashed potato, kasha (buckwheat groats), or cheese. Other varieties of fillings include beef, chicken, sweet potatoes, black beans, or spinach.

Knishes may be round, rectangular, or square. They may be entirely covered in dough or some of the filling may peek out of the top. Sizes range from those that can be eaten in a single bite hors d&#x27;oeuvre to sandwich-sized.

==History in the United States==

Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants who arrived sometime around 1900 brought knishes to the United States. Knish (קניש) is a Yiddish word of Slavic origin, related to the Ukrainian &quot;knysh&quot; (книш) and Polish &quot;knysz&quot;. The ancestor of the knish was a medieval fried vegetable patty or fritter called &quot;knysz&quot;; eventually it became a stuffed item. In Ukraine, the &quot;knysz&quot; evolved into a filled yeasted bun, and today is usually sweet rather than savoury; the Russian cousin to the Jewish knish is the pirozhok (пирожки́). The traditional food spread to neighbour countries, migration from which helped spread the food further. Knishes began to be baked (rather than fried) around the same time that the potato was popularized in Eastern Europe, and the dough wrapper gradually became more like pastry than bread.

The first knish bakery in America was founded in New York City in 1910. Generally recognized as a food made popular in New York City by Jewish immigrants in the early 20th century, the United States underwent a knish renaissance in the 2000s driven by knish specialty establishments such as Knishes and Dishes in Philadelphia, the Knish Shop in Baltimore, Maryland, Buffalo and Bergen in Washington, DC, or My Mother&#x27;s Knish, in Westlake Village, California.

In the 20th century, New York City and state politicians portrayed themselves eating knishes to show solidarity with Jewish working-class people. The trend declined after suburbanization and the policies of Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani that restricted the sale of knishes from food carts.

<text>Usurp Synapse is a screamo band from Lafayette, Indiana. The group combines fast and frantic grindcore influenced drumming and guitar work, and raw screams.

==History==
Usurp Synapse formed in 1998 in Lafayette, Indiana. Their line up changed somewhat frequently during their initial run. Antonio Leiriao, their second vocalist, originally lived in New York before he moved to Indiana in 1999 to join the group. Most of their music was released through split albums with other artists, perhaps their most famous split being their &quot;Just Do It!&quot; record with Hassan I Sabbah, which included razor blades. Unconventional marketing methods such as this was utilized by the band throughout their run.

In 2000, they toured the United States along with Jeromes Dream, who they also released a split with, and Racebannon from May to June. This would become the only major nationwide tour for the band. In 2001, they announced plans to do another tour in the United States, Europe, and Japan over the summer. They also announced plans to release a split with Pg. 99, a split with Mara&#x27;akate shaped as Indiana, and what would have been the band&#x27;s first full-length album, which was under the working title of &quot;ATM Diatribe&quot;. That same year Mike Dixon (who previously worked in the band Rep Seki) joined Usurp Synapse as the keyboardist.

Later that same year it was announced that all plans, except for &quot;ATM Diatribe&quot;, had to be cancelled. &quot;ATM Diatribe&quot; was initially supposed to be released on compact disc and vinyl through Happy Couples Never Last, however that too was cancelled when the band broke up in the spring of 2001. The tracks from the &quot;ATM Diatribe&quot; sessions, along with the rest of the band&#x27;s recorded discography, was eventually released on &quot;Disinformation Fix&quot;, a discography compilation released through Alone Records.

In 2008, the group released &quot;A Vile Contamina&quot; through their Myspace page for free. The EP included material recorded during their reformative period.

Former members of the band would later join other projects such as Fax Arcana and The Drago Miette, both of whom are now disbanded. Antonio Leirao would move on to the indie rock band Thin Fevers and is now a funk DJ. Chance now works as a session drummer in New York and was one of the many drummers who played in The Boredoms 2008 88 Boadrums event.

<text>Hierarchical INTegration, or HINT for short, is a computer benchmark that ranks a computer system as a whole (i.e. the entire computer instead of individual components). It measures the full range of performance, mostly based on the amount of work a computer can perform over time. A system with a very fast processor would likely be rated poorly if the buses were very poor compared to those of another system that had both an average processor and average buses. For example, in the past, Macintosh computers with relatively slow processor speeds (800 MHz) used to perform better than x86 based systems with processors running at nearly 2 GHz.

HINT is known for being almost immune to artificial optimization and can be used by many computers ranging from a calculator to a supercomputer. It was developed at the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Ames Laboratory and is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

HINT is intended to be &quot;scalable&quot; to run on any size computer, from small serial systems to highly parallel supercomputers.
The person using the HINT benchmark can use any floating-point or integer type.

HINT benchmark results have been published comparing a variety of parallel and uniprocessor systems.

A related tool ANALYTIC HINT can be used as a design tool to estimate the benefits of using more memory, a faster processor, or improved communications (bus speed) within the system.

<doc id="1081962" wikidata="Q484870" url="?curid=1081962" title="Eisleben">
<text>Eisleben is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is famous as both the hometown of the influential theologian Martin Luther and the place where he died; hence, its official name is [[Lutherstadt]] Eisleben. 

First mentioned in the late 10th century, Eisleben is divided into the old town of Alstadt, and new town of Neustadt. Neustadt was created for Eisleben&#x27;s miners in the 14th century. As of 2020, Eisleben had a population of 22,668. It lies on the Halle–Kassel railway.

==History==
Eisleben was first mentioned in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The counts of Mansfeld governed the area until the 18th century. During the Protestant Reformation, Count Hoyer VI of Mansfeld-Vorderort (1477–1540) remained loyal to his Catholic faith, but the family&#x27;s Mittelort and Hinterort branches sided with Martin Luther. 

The German Peasants&#x27; War devastated the area, about a century before the Thirty Years War. Count Albert VII of Mansfeld-Hinterort (1480–1560) signed the Protestant Augsburg Confession in 1530 and joined the Schmalkaldic League, a defensive confederation of Protestant princes which ultimately lost the Schmalkaldic War over Saxony to the forces of Emperor Charles V but gained Lutheranism&#x27;s recognition as an official religion within the Holy Roman Empire, letting princes determine the official religion within their lands.

After the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, the Countess of Mansfield, Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben, a Protestant canoness at the Abbey of Gerresheim to the east, converted Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne to Calvinism. Their marriage and his declaration of religious parity throughout his lands caused another round of religious war, the Cologne War. The couple fled numerous times through various German states before Gerhard relinquished his claims in 1588. He was unable to convert his electorate into a dynasty. He died and was buried in Strasbourg in 1601. His lady, who could not return to the convent, was afforded protection by the Dukes of Württemberg. She died in 1601, terminating the family&#x27;s Mittelort branch.

In 1574, the surviving Mansfeld counts Hans Hoyer, Hans Georg, Hans Albrecht and Bruno concluded an agreement with the Elector of Saxony to repay the family&#x27;s extensive debts, but some properties were forfeited by 1579 anyway. The Hinterort branches died out in 1666, but the Mansfeld-Vorderort line lasted until 1780, when it too became extinct and Eisleben came directly under the Electorate of Saxony. After the Napoleonic Wars ended, the Vienna Congress assigned Eisleben to the Kingdom of Prussia, which had long been allied with House of Welf which held the Duchy of Magdeburg, and after secularization in 1680 was administered by the Elector of Brandenburg.

===20th century===
The Prussian Province of Saxony became part of the Free State of Prussia after World War I. It was the scene of fighting during the March Action in 1921.

On 6 June 1927, American aviator Clarence D. Chamberlin landed in a wheat field outside Eisleben, completing the first transatlantic passenger flight (Charles Albert Levine was the passenger), and breaking Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s distance record that set only two weeks earlier in Paris.

In 1947, after World War II, Eisleben became part of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt within the German Democratic Republic (GDR). During the 1952 administration reform it became part of Bezirk Halle. After Germany&#x27;s reunification in 1990, it became part of the re-created state Saxony-Anhalt. Eisleben was the capital of the former district of Mansfelder Land and of the former &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Lutherstadt Eisleben.

===21st century===
Between 2004 and 2010, the town Eisleben absorbed 10 former municipalities: Volkstedt in 2004, Rothenschirmbach and Wolferode in 2005, Polleben and Unterrißdorf in 2006, Bischofrode, Osterhausen and Schmalzerode in 2009, and Burgsdorf and Hedersleben in 2010.

===Historical population===
The population has been declining since the mid-1960s due to declining birth rates and outward migration, although the municipal area has been enlarged several times by merging with neighboring districts.
:* 

==Geography==

The town Eisleben consists of Eisleben proper and the following 11 &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Bischofrode
*Burgsdorf
*Hedersleben
*Helfta
*Osterhausen
*Polleben
*Rothenschirmbach
*Schmalzerode
*Unterrißdorf
*Volkstedt
*Wolferode
===Helfta===
The Counts of Mansfeld in 1229 endowed a nunnery on the grounds of their castle, then built another monastery at Helfta near Eisleben, which was founded in 1258. Governed under either Benedictines or Cistercians, Helfta became known for its powerful and mystical abbesses, most of all Gertrude of Hackeborn, Gertrude the Great and Mechtild of Magdeburg. However, Duke Albrecht of Brunswick destroyed the nunnery in 1342. Rebuilt the following year, it was sometimes called the &quot;crown of German convents&quot;. It closed in 1524, during the religious wars sometimes associated with Martin Luther, but reopened on a smaller scale until 1542, after which it became secularized, and controlled by local farmers. In 1712 it became a farm run by the Prussian state, and the buildings were reused accordingly. In 1950, the German Democratic Republic turned it into a fruit farm. In 1994, after Germany&#x27;s reunification, the Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg bought the property using donations from all over the world and soon began restoration. Cistercian nuns from Seligenthal in Bavaria moved into the cloister starting circa 1999, Since 2006 Helfta has been on the southern portion of a major European cultural route, the Romanesque Road.

==Martin Luther==

The Protestant reformer Martin Luther was born in Eisleben on 10 November 1483. His father, Hans Luther, was a miner like many in Eisleben. Luther&#x27;s family moved to Mansfeld when he was only a year old and he lived in Wittenberg most of his life. Seemingly by chance Luther preached his last sermon and died in Eisleben in 1546.

Eisleben took steps to preserve its Luther memorials as far back as 1689, and pioneered &quot;heritage tourism.&quot; Danish poet Hans Christian Andersen came to Eisleben while researching Lutheran links as well as touring through Saxony and the Harz Mountains in 1831.

In 1997, Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Birth House&quot; and &quot;Death House&quot; were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with the Luther sites in Wittenberg, because of their testimony to the lasting worldwide effects of Luther&#x27;s religious and political reforms. Also, Luther was baptised in Eisleben&#x27;s St. Peter and Paul Church (the original font survives) and preached his last sermons at St. Andreas Church, both of which continue in use.

<doc id="1081971" wikidata="Q5361253" url="?curid=1081971" title="Eliot Rosewater">
<text>Eliot Rosewater is a recurring character in the novels of American author Kurt Vonnegut. He appears throughout various novels as an alcoholic, and a philanthropist who claims to be a volunteer fireman. He runs the Rosewater Foundation, an organization created to keep the family&#x27;s money in the family. He is among the few fans of the novels of Kilgore Trout (another of Vonnegut&#x27;s creations).

== &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; ==
&quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,&quot; or, &quot;Pearls Before Swine,&quot; the first of Vonnegut&#x27;s novels to feature the character of Eliot Rosewater, is also the one in which he is the most prominent.

The 1965 novel follows much of his life as the liberal son of a rich, conservative Senator from Rosewater County, Indiana who founded the Rosewater Foundation. Eliot Rosewater is convinced that he should spend the family riches to help the poor and uses the Foundation to this end, an idea looked down upon by his father. Norman Mushari, an opportunistic former associate of the Rosewater family lawyer, attempts to have Eliot declared insane so that the family wealth can be inherited by his new client, a distant relative to the east. This and other crises lead to a year-long mental blackout, after which Rosewater&#x27;s favorite writer, Kilgore Trout, tries to explain to the Senator that Eliot&#x27;s actions were sane and compassionate.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;[Vonnegut] at his wildest best&quot; and Conrad Aiken said that it&#x27;s &quot;a brilliantly funny satire on almost everything&quot;.

== &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; ==
&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five,&quot; or &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade,&quot; first published in 1969, features Eliot Rosewater in Chapter Five. Billy Pilgrim, the main character of the novel, has committed himself to a psychiatric hospital during his last year of optometry school, and finds himself sharing a room with Eliot Rosewater. Eliot introduces Billy Pilgrim to the works of Kilgore Trout, which set the foundation for Billy&#x27;s adventures through time and with the Tralfamadorians, aliens that Billy claims abducted him.

== Film appearances ==
* &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1971), played by Henry Bumstead
* &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1999), played by Ken Hudson Campbell

<doc id="1081975" wikidata="Q252696" url="?curid=1081975" title="Fir Park">
<text>Fir Park Stadium is a football stadium situated in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The stadium plays host to the home matches of Scottish Premiership club Motherwell and was the temporary home of Gretna for the 2007–08 SPL season. Motherwell moved to the stadium in 1896, previously playing their football at Dalziel Park.

== History and facilities==
Motherwell F.C. was formed in 1886. It played at sites on Roman Road and Dalziel Park until 1895, when Fir Park was opened. The ground was laid out in a wooded area belonging to Lord Hamilton of Dalzell, whose racing colours were claret and amber. Motherwell then adopted these colours themselves. Fir Park did not get off to a convincing start, with low attendances leading to rumours that Hibernian were ready to take over the stadium, something that didn&#x27;t materialise.

The record attendance for the stadium is 35,632 against Rangers in a 1951–52 Scottish Cup replay (Motherwell went on to win the competition).

===Stands===
The stadium has an unbalanced look about it, with one large stand contrasting with three smaller structures, one of which does not extend the full length of the pitch. It has been an all-seater stadium since the 1990s, with a capacity of .

For most of the 20th century, Fir Park consisted of one main stand and a ring of terracing around the other three sides In 1977, Fir Park came within the terms of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Only routine work was needed to keep the ground within the legislation, but it reduced capacity from 35,000 to 22,500 (including 3,500 seats in the Main Stand and two open terraces behind each goal). The Taylor Report in 1990 mandated that all top division clubs develop all-seater stadiums. At that time the community of Motherwell also had to overcome the economic challenges caused by the closure of the nearby Ravenscraig steelworks. The east side&#x27;s covered enclosure was soon seated and within five years the open ends were demolished and new stands built.

====Phil O&#x27;Donnell Main Stand====

Construction of a new two tier main stand began in 1962. The £92,000 cost of this work was financed by a small quote and the selling of two players, Pat Quinn and Ian St John. To minimise disruption to the smaller old stand, the steel frame was built over and behind it. Construction of the stand stopped 20 yards short of the south end, however, because a local resident successfully objected to a full-length structure because it would have restricted light to the garden and reduced the value of the property. By the time the property owner had decided to sell, Motherwell did not have the funds or will to complete a full-length main stand, leaving a section of the frame intact but unused to this day. The club instead bought the house and used it for their offices.

During the construction of the new end stands in the 1990s, the main stand was re-clad and given a makeover to complement the modernised stadium, with windshields constructed at each end offering protection to fans. The stand has two hospitality suites, named The Centenary Suite and The Millennium Suite. It also has a roof-mounted gantry for television cameras, and press facilities. The Main Stand was renamed the Phil O&#x27;Donnell Stand in January 2008, to honour the Motherwell captain who died on the Fir Park pitch. A sculptured tribute to O&#x27;Donnell was added to the north wall of the stand in 2011. 

====John Hunter (east) Stand==== 

The East Enclosure was formerly an area of open terracing, which was roofed in 1954 costing £6,500. Floodlight lamps were built on its roof and that of the main stand to host floodlit matches, and the first of these, against Preston North End, was played in 1956. The enclosure roof was damaged by strong winds, however, which meant that large corner floodlight pylons were built in 1959. To meet the Taylor Report requirements, it was converted to seating and re-cladded in the early 1990s, the £750,000 work financed partly by the club&#x27;s Scottish Cup win in 1991. Although the East Enclosure is shallow, it allows sufficient legroom by only having seats on every second step. It houses the more vocal home support at Fir Park. The Scottish Health Council slogan &quot;Keep cigarettes away from the match&quot; adorned the roof for many years, but this was replaced by a Cash Converters advertisement in 2011. The Enclosure backs onto a concourse and then Knowetop Primary School.

In 2016, the East Enclosure was renamed in honour of John Hunter, manager of the club&#x27;s only Scottish Football League title-winning team in 1931–32. This stand&#x27;s roof suffered from leaks, eventually repaired in 2017. Further refurbishments, including the replacement of all seats, took place in early 2021, following the recent club record sale of David Turnbull, and with supporters unable to attend the stadium due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland. 

====Tommy McLean (south) Stand====

The South Stand is named after former manager Tommy McLean and was previously named the Maxim Office Park Stand for sponsorship reasons. The structure dominates the surrounding area, as it can be seen from all around Motherwell and the nearby M74 motorway. It is a two-tiered structure holding 4,856 fans and was opened on 26 April 1993 with a friendly match against Coventry City. The upper deck offers a panoramic view, beyond the centre of Motherwell to the distant Ochil Hills and Ben Lomond. It normally houses the away support. When the South Stand was first opened, Motherwell offered £20 debentures guaranteeing tickets for the games played by the relevant visiting team at Fir Park. This offer targeted supporters of the Old Firm clubs, with 600 debentures sold by late 1995, mostly to Rangers fans. Unusually for a stand designated for away fans, it has a row of corporate boxes running along between the two tiers. The South Stand also houses a gymnasium and warm up area.

The stand was renamed the Tommy McLean Stand in November 2021 after Tommy McLean, manager of Motherwell from 1984 to 1994 and winner of the 1991 Scottish Cup Final.

====Davie Cooper (north) Stand====

The Davie Cooper Stand is of relatively similar design to the South Stand – both were designed by the company WH Dickie Architects, owned by Bill Dickie who was also a club director and SFA president – but only has one tier and a capacity of 2,373 seats. Motherwell were refused planning permission to construct a two tier structure, of similar design as the South Stand, at that end. This stand was officially opened on 6 May 1995, completing the stadium in its present format, and is dedicated to former player Davie Cooper who died in the year that it was opened. It houses the club shop, the Davie Cooper Suite, an IT department and hospitality boxes.

===Pitch===
The layout of the Fir Park pitch is unusual in that there is a slope of around from its east side down to the west side. This is perhaps most noticeable on the Davie Cooper Stand, where the east pitchside entry points are at ground level but those on the west side require a flight of steps; this can also be seen on the South Stand, but is not as obvious due to its larger size. The slope causes issues with drainage and turf quality, as does the shadow over the grass for most of each sunny day created by the looming South Stand. A less specific issue is the high levels of rainfall experienced in the west of Scotland. The pitch received negative publicity during the late 2000s for being sparsely-turfed in parts and frequently waterlogged, and several games were postponed. The pitch and the consequent fixture congestion forced Gretna, who were ground-sharing with Motherwell in the 2007–08 season, to play one of their league games at Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. In the 2008–09 season, a Motherwell game against Hearts was called off due to the pitch being frozen, which prompted media criticism as the required under-soil heating should have prevented this.
The pitch underwent extensive remedial work, costing £350,000, in preparation for the 2009–10 Scottish Premier League season. There was a severe winter in 2009–10, however, which damaged the pitch greatly. The club tried to make the best of the situation by relaying both goal mouths. In season 2010–11, the club removed the top few inches of the pitch and completely relaid the pitch. They also added twisted sand fibre which should prevent the pitch from tearing as easily. On 2 December 2011, a match against Hibernian was abandoned at half-time due to a floodlight fire causing safety concerns.

In recent seasons, the pitch at Fir Park has been considered one of the best in the UK, winning the best pitch in the Scottish Premiership in the 2017–18 season. The drastic change in the playing surface came after considerable investment including the purchase of several lighting rigs to encourage turf growth, the cessation of all activities other than first team matches – preserving its condition and promoting an idea of grandeur and exclusivity among the youth squads hoping to play on it – and expert refurbishment led by head groundskeeper Paul Matthew who joined the club in 2014.

Between 2021 and 2022, Motherwell&#x27;s board invested part of the income from the club&#x27;s record sale of David Turnbull in the installment of a new hybrid surface, mainly made of grass and strengthened by synthetic fibers, at Fir Park, becoming the fourth club in Scotland (after Celtic, Rangers and Heart of Midlothian) to do so in the process.

==Other uses==
During the 2007–08 season, Gretna rented Fir Park from Motherwell and played all but one of their home SPL games there. The now-defunct club also played their UEFA Cup tie against Derry City at the stadium in 2006. Over the years the stadium has played host to several Scottish Challenge Cup finals and hosted Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 2007 and 2010. Fir Park also hosted the opening ceremony of the 2011 International Children&#x27;s Games, which were being held in Lanarkshire.

Fir Park was used as the home venue for the Scotland women&#x27;s national football team during the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup qualifying campaign.

==Future==
At the 2008 annual general meeting, Motherwell announced plans to investigate the possibility of a redevelopment of Fir Park, or the possibility of a move to a new ground. Motherwell chairman John Boyle indicated at the following year&#x27;s AGM that the club would not be leaving Fir Park within the next five to ten years. In June 2010, the club said that the repair of the pitch, which had come in for some fierce criticism in the latter part of the 2009–10 season, would be the last major investment at the stadium. In September 2011, vice-chairman Derek Weir indicated that the club are &#x27;nowhere near&#x27; a ground move, insisting that the £15 million it would cost would be beyond their means.

In November 2019, with the club almost free of debt, chief executive Alan Burrows stated that the possibility of leaving Fir Park for a new ground &quot;probably has to be a debate and a question that is put on the agenda quite high in the not too distant future&quot; due to the age and standard of some of the facilities; however in early 2021, extensive refurbishments were carried out on the John Hunter Stand, with Burrows indicating work would also be carried out on the other stands.

==Transport==
Motherwell railway station is approximately 15 minutes walking distance from Fir Park. Local trains on the Argyle Line serve Airbles railway station, which is closer to the ground. People travelling by car can use the M74 motorway, leaving at junction 6. The A723 and B754 (Airbles Road) roads lead to Fir Park. Alternatively, visitors from the east or north who come to Motherwell via Newhouse (junction 6 of the M8 motorway) should follow the A723 through Carfin to Motherwell and then take the A721 road to Fir Park. Car parking is available in the surrounding streets.

<doc id="1081997" wikidata="Q6135622" url="?curid=1081997" title="James &quot;Shack&quot; Harris">
<text>James Larnell &quot;Shack&quot; Harris (born July 20, 1947) is an American former professional football player and executive. He played as a quarterback in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL) with the Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles Rams, and San Diego Chargers. In 1969, Harris became the first Black quarterback to start a season opener for the either the AFL or NFL, and in 1974, he became the first Black quarterback to start an NFL playoff game. After his playing career, Harris worked in the front office for the Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Baltimore Ravens, where he was a part of the Super Bowl XXXV-winning team.

==Early life==
Harris grew up in Monroe, Louisiana. He is the son of Lula B. and father, Nashall Harris, Sr., a furniture maker and minister. His older sister is Lucille Richards, and his older brother is Nashall Harris, Jr., who was called &quot;Meshach&quot; that morphed into &quot;Shack.&quot; James, the younger brother, was called &quot;Little Shack.&quot; When his older brother left home to join the Army, and James grew to six feet-four inches, the family dropped the &quot;Little&quot; from his nickname to just &quot;Shack.&quot;

Harris attended Carroll High in Monroe, where he led the football team to a Louisiana state championship in his sophomore year, and two perfect seasons. He was twice named to the all state football team. A straight-A student, Harris also played on the school&#x27;s baseball team.

==College football career==
Harris played college football for HBCU Grambling State University from 1965 to 1968, and as a three-year starter led the Tigers to a 24-5-1 record. Coached by legendary Grambling coach Eddie Robinson, Harris and his teammates won or shared all four Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) titles during his college career. Harris was specifically trained as a prototypical pocket-passer-by Robinson and broke numerous passing records at Grambling. In 1967, he was named MVP of the Orange Blossom Classic.

In 2023, Grambling renamed its football field, the &quot;James &quot;Shack&quot; Harris and Doug Williams Field at Eddie G. Robinson Memorial Stadium,&quot; to honor the university&#x27;s most prominent football alumni.

==Professional football career==

===Buffalo Bills===
Harris was drafted in the eighth round of the 1969 Common draft by the American Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills, and would soon join fellow rookie O. J. Simpson in the starting backfield.

Continuing the American Football League&#x27;s more liberal (than the NFL&#x27;s) personnel policies, the Bills made Harris the first black player to start a season at quarterback in the history of pro football. 

Harris was also just the second black player in the modern era to start in any game as quarterback for a professional football team. Wide receiver Marlin Briscoe, of the AFL&#x27;s Denver Broncos, had been the first to start a game at quarterback in 1968, and a few of Harris&#x27;s completions in 1969 went to Briscoe, who, by that time, had been traded to the Bills and had been converted to the position of receiver. In the first game of the season against the defending champion New York Jets, he went 3-of-12 for 74 yards with an interception while making a run for six yards before being replaced by Jack Kemp (playing his final season) as the Bills were trounced 33–19. It was his only start for the season, and Harris threw just 24 total passes combined in the other three games he appeared in as the team went 4–10. He scored his first touchdown on a throw to Haven Moses for 39 yards in a 50–21 loss to the Oakland Raiders. He made no starts in 1970, going 24-of-50 for 338 yards with three touchdowns and four interceptions in a year where the Bills went 3-10-1 while using newly drafted Dennis Shaw as their main starter. For his third and last year with the team, he made two starts (both losses) with seven appearances, going 51-of-103 for 512 total yards with one touchdown and six interceptions. After three years with the Bills, Harris was released by the team and signed by the Los Angeles Rams in 1972.

===Los Angeles Rams===
In 1973, Harris was the understudy to veteran John Hadl as the Rams went 12-2 and returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1969. As the 1974 season began, the Rams offense sputtered under Hadl and the team stood at 3–2 after five games. In an effort to spark the Los Angeles offense, Rams head coach Chuck Knox promoted Harris as the starting quarterback. In his starting debut for the Rams against the San Francisco 49ers, Harris completed 12 of 15 passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for another as the Rams won easily, 37–14, at the Los Angeles Coliseum. The performance earned Harris a perfect passer rating for the game. Two days later, Hadl was then traded to Green Bay, and Harris became the Rams&#x27; first-string quarterback for the remainder of the 1974 season. The football world was stunned by the bold move. However, Harris came through by leading the team to seven wins in its last nine regular-season games. He led the team to its second straight NFC Western Division title, as well as their first playoff victory (19–10 over the Washington Redskins) since 1951. Harris thus became the first African-American quarterback to start and win an NFL playoff game. The Rams lost the NFC Championship Game to the Minnesota Vikings 14–10. Harris was named to the NFC Pro Bowl team in 1974 and was awarded MVP of that game.

The strong-armed Harris helped lead the team to another division title in 1975. Harris, in turn, became the first Black quarterback to open a season as his team&#x27;s starter in National Football League history. However, he injured his shoulder very early in the Rams&#x27; Week 13 win over the Green Bay Packers; backup Ron Jaworski then led the Rams to wins against Green Bay and the Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as to a 35–23 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in the divisional playoff game. Knox named Harris the starter for the NFC Championship games vs. Dallas. Harris&#x27; first pass was intercepted, and after one more incompletion and a Dallas 21-0 first-quarter lead, he was pulled in favor of Jaworski. It didn&#x27;t matter as Dallas went on to a 37–7 win.

Harris&#x27; injuries continued to give him problems in the 1976 season. The Rams went with three quarterbacks; Harris, Jaworski, and rookie Pat Haden from USC. With Harris injured, Jaworski opened the season as the starter and was injured in the opener. Haden led the team to a comeback tie against the Minnesota Vikings in the second game. Harris, with his throwing shoulder mended, reclaimed his starting job and led the team to two wins, including a 436-yard passing performance against the Miami Dolphins. However, in the next game, on Monday night at home against the San Francisco 49ers, Harris was sacked 10 times and re-injured his shoulder as the Rams were shut out 16–0 at home for the first time since moving to Los Angeles. The Jaworski/Haden platoon led the team to two more wins, then Harris returned again for a win over the then-first-year Seattle Seahawks and a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. Against the Bengals, however, Harris played poorly and Knox felt like Harris was not fully healthy. After the game, Knox decided to go with Haden as the starter for the rest of the season. Under Haden, the Rams won three out of four and the NFC West division title. Knox stuck with Haden in the 1976 playoffs, even though Harris was healthy enough to see action late in the season, including a season-ending comeback win over the Detroit Lions. In the NFC title game, the stout Minnesota defense harassed Haden the entire game as the Vikings beat the Rams 24–13 to advance to Super Bowl XI. Despite the benching, Harris&#x27; 89.6 passer rating that year was tied for the highest in the NFC. It was the first time a black quarterback ever led his conference in that category.

===San Diego Chargers===
Harris was released to the San Diego Chargers prior to the 1977 season. The experience with the Rams hurt him. &quot;I lost my passion,&quot; he said in the book &quot;Third and a Mile&quot;. &quot;Coach Knox was supportive but the owner Carroll Rosenbloom was going over his head.

&quot;As a quarterback, I had done all I could, more than most people could, but it still wasn&#x27;t enough for the Los Angeles Rams organization to accept me as a quarterback, not a black quarterback,&quot; he commented. At the time of his departure, Harris held the highest career completion average of any quarterback in Rams team history (55.4%) and had been an integral part of three straight NFC West Champions. Harris was deeply upset by his trade from a perennial playoff team to a team in rebuilding mode and also by losing his status as a starting quarterback. Nonetheless, Harris maintained a good relationship with Chuck Knox until the latter&#x27;s death in 2018.

He made nine starts in his first year due to Dan Fouts holding out for more money, going 4–5 while throwing 109-for-211 with 1,240 yards, five touchdowns and 11 interceptions. The following year, he played in nine games while starting two of them, throwing 42-of-88 for 518 yards, two touchdowns and nine interceptions. Harris last saw playing time in 1979, appearing in eight games and throwing just 5-of-9 for 38 yards with an interception.

Harris is thought to be the inspiration for the NFL films song, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Man From Gramblin&#x27;&quot; composed by Sam Spence.

==Front office career==

In 1987, Harris began his front office career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He worked as team scout for six years, and then signed with the New York Jets as the team&#x27;s assistant general manager for three years until 1996. 

Harris served as the Baltimore Ravens Director of Pro Personnel from 1997 to 2003. During his tenure, the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV. In 2003, Harris left the Ravens organization and went on to serve as the Vice President of Player Personnel for the Jacksonville Jaguars, resigning on December 23, 2008. He also served on the NFL subcommittee on college relations.

On February 2, 2009, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that the Detroit Lions were set to hire Harris as a personnel executive. On February 12, 2009, the Detroit Lions officially named Harris as Senior Personnel Executive. Lions General Manager Martin Mayhew has a long history with Harris, and indicated he was the only individual who was offered the job. Harris assisted in all areas of player personnel in an advisory role. 

Harris officially &quot;retired from the NFL&quot; on February 27, 2015.

==Shack Harris &amp; Doug Williams Foundation==

In collaboration with Doug Williams, Harris established the Shack Harris &amp; Doug Williams Foundation in 2005. In 2009 and 2010, Harris and Williams played pivotal roles in establishing the Black College Football Hall of Fame (BCF-HOF). The BCF-HOF ceremonies are presented annually by the Shack Harris &amp; Doug Williams Foundation.

<text>Rugby Park (Scottish Gaelic: Pàirc Rugbaidh), also known as The BBSP Stadium Rugby Park for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium which is the home of Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock F.C. and is situated in the Scottish town of Kilmarnock. With a capacity of , it is the 7th–largest football stadium in Scotland, and was first used in 1899, also having been used for concerts, rugby union and international football fixtures. The stadium underwent a major redevelopment in 1994–1995, becoming an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 18,128. In 2002, the club constructed the Park Hotel, a 4-star hotel complex next to the ground.

During the 1994–95 season the stadium capacity was reduced to 18,128 as a result of the construction of three new stands - the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. The renovated stadium opened on 6 August 1995, with a friendly match against Blackburn Rovers F.C. Rugby Park has since further renovations, with an artificial pitch being installed in the summer of 2014, safe standing available from November 2019 and underground heating installed in 1999. In August 2010, the West Stand was renamed the Frank Beattie Stand in honour of former player Frank Beattie who captained Kilmarnock to their Scottish League Championship victory in 1965.

As well as football matches, Rugby Park has also hosted rugby matches, most recently between Scotland and Georgia in July 2016. The venue has also hosted four international football matches for the Scotland national football team in 1894, 1910 and two most recently in 1997.

==History==
===Original stadiums===
Kilmarnock played at three other sites (The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward&#x27;s Park) in their early years, before the club moved to Rugby Park in December 1877. This was not the precise site of the present stadium, as the field is now covered by Charles Street. While is initially unclear the exact place in which Kilmarnock F.C. played their first match, Recreation Ground, also known as Barbadoes Green, was situated across from Dundonald Road where a much larger area known as Wards Park was situated. In the late 1860s, Wards Park consisted of rough grassland, and is considered the earliest site of both Kilmarnock F.C. and Rugby Park.

The first stadium known as Rugby Park after being officially named as such in November 1872 was situated on Dundonald Road. In April 1874, the club left this ground before returning to approximately the same field in December 1877. The club later played at The Grange between 1874 and 1876, also playing one game at Holm Quarry in April 1874, 1876 and 1877. The club left The Grange in 1876, but returned between September–November 1877.

The club moved to Rugby Park on Dundonald Road in 1877 and remained playing at the stadium until 1899, when the stadium relocated to a new stadium built on recreation and agricultural ground where it has remained as Kilmarnock Football Club&#x27;s home ground since 1899.

===&quot;New&quot; Rugby Park===

The current site was decided by Ross Quigley who was Kilmarnock&#x27;s first director. The grounds were shared by cricket and rugby teams – sports which Kilmarnock had played previously – and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. Rugby Park hosted its first international match in March 1894, when Scotland won 5–2 against Wales. Originally, the ground was constructed with a running track around its edge, a pavilion and a stand along the west side. This layout meant that Rugby Park was similar to Ibrox Park, which opened four months later.


The &quot;new&quot; Rugby Park opened to fans in 1899 with a home game for Kilmarnock F.C. against Celtic F.C. which finished in a 2–2 draw. It was Kilmarnock F.C.&#x27;s first match in the top tier of Scottish football, having won the Second Division the previous season. The new Rugby Park pitch had been moved south-westwards and a new grandstand for spectators being built, which was designed by football stadium architect Archibald Leitch. Delays to the construction by joinery strikes caused workers to still be working on finishing the grandstand on the morning of the first match at the new stadium with Celtic. The grandstand was extended in 1914 and was extensively re-modelled and re-roofed in 1961.

In 1940, Rugby Park was requisitioned by the War Department for use as a fuel storage area, due to its proximity to the Kilmarnock railway station and the ability for fuel tanks to be assembly underneath the stadium pitch. The clubs board of directors &quot;reluctantly&quot; agreed to the requisition of the stadium, announcing the suspension of playing &quot;for the duration&quot;. In the Summer of 1944, the War Department prepared to hand Rugby Park over to the board of directors at Kilmarnock Football Club. Having done so, the stadium, pitch and grandstand were found to be in an undesirable state after four years of military use. The club eventually received compensation from the government and the War Department for the damage caused. Work commenced on repairing the stadium, with Italian prisoners of war being used to build up the terracing.

On 28 October 1953, floodlights began operating at Rugby Park and were officially opened between a friendly; Manchester United F.C. and Kilmarnock F.C. which results in 3–0 win for Manchester United. The official recorded attendance at the game was 12,639 at Rugby Park. A new grandstand was built in 1961, with space to accommodate 4,000 spectators. Kilmarnock manager Willie Waddell commented on the developments at Rugby Park; &quot;to be a top grade club, you must have top grade accommodation&quot;.

===1994–1997 reconstruction=== 

Demolition work began at Rugby Park on 8 May 1994, with the stadiums West Stand receiving a major refurbishment including new roofing and floodlights. Both the covered terracing and covered enclosures of the stadium were demolished to make way for the construction of two new stands, the East Stand and the South Stand (the &quot;Moffat Stand&quot;), which were first used on 27 August and 19 November 1994 respectively. The north terracing area had remained in used during construction works, but was demolished in 1995 to allow the construction of the new North Stand (the &quot;Chadwick Stand&quot;), which was first used on 20 April 1995 against Rangers F.C.. 

Taking 49 weeks to complete, the re-construction of Rugby Park transformed the stadium into a modern, 18,128 all-seated stadium, featuring new floodlights and two American style scoreboards situated at the top of both the Moffatt and Chadwick Stands. As of October 2023, both scoreboards are no longer installed on either stand. The official opening of the reconstructed Rugby Park occurred on 8 August 1995, with a match between English Premiership Champions Blackburn Rovers F.C. and Kilmarnock F.C., finishing 0–5. 

===Renovations===
 
Safety regulations cut the capacity of Rugby Park to 17,528 by the 1980s, but this figure was rarely troubled as the club fell to the Second Division. The Taylor Report, published in January 1990, recommended that British stadiums should become all-seater. Around the same time, a new board of directors took control of Kilmarnock. The new board initially proposed to move the club to an out-of-town site besides the A77 road as part of a wider development, but this was rejected by planning restrictions. The board then decided to redevelop Rugby Park. The last game before reconstruction was played on 7 May 1994, when Kilmarnock beat Rangers 1–0. During the 1994–95 season the capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to 18,128. The work was completed in just 348 days, as the new stands were first opened for a game against Rangers on 20 April. Kilmarnock officially opened the new Rugby Park on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English league champions Blackburn Rovers. Alan Shearer hit a hat-trick as the home team lost 5–0.

On 12 May 1998 Rugby Park hosted the last Ayrshire Cup final, as Kilmarnock fought back from 0–2 to beat Ayr United 4–2. In the summer of 1999, league regulations meant that Kilmarnock had to install undersoil heating at the ground. On 26 August of that year, Kilmarnock celebrated one hundred years at Rugby Park with a victory over KR Reykjavik in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup.

Some work has since been done to increase the revenue created by the ground. In June 2002 the Park Hotel was opened adjacent to the stadium. The hotel was built on the site of Kilmarnock&#x27;s training pitch and accommodates fifty twin/double bedrooms, a conference centre, a café, bar and restaurant. In November 2004 a new sports bar was opened in the West Stand, sponsored by Foster&#x27;s Lager.

In 2014, new 3G artificial surfacing was installed at Rugby Park.

===Recent developments===

An artificial playing surface was installed in the summer of 2014. This was later replaced by an artificial hybrid surface during the 2019 close season. In November 2023 the club announced their intention to replace the artificial surface with natural grass in 2025, if work on a separate training facility can be completed.

In February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands. The installation process was completed in early December of that year. In 2020, plans were unveiled revealing details of plans for further renovations at Rugby Park, creating a new entrance, changing facilities and community resources, including a memorial garden. During the 2021–22 season offices were installed in the upper deck of the Moffat Stand, which reduced the seating capacity of the stadium to 15,552.

==Stadium design==
Despite becoming a modern, all-seater stadium, a number of features in the design of the stands give it a unique look. All stands bar the West Stand have very little beneath them, as the tea bars and toilets are located under the lowest possible point towards the pitch. The rest of the area underneath is open tarmac, with the steel framework fully exposed. Moreover, the turnstiles for the three newer stands are built into a perimeter wall rather than the stadium itself, and there are very large open air spaces before the stands themselves. Other stadiums have a similar design – for example Tynecastle&#x27;s Roseburn Stand, although there is considerably less space there. One advantage is that since the public smoking ban has come into force it has been possible for fans to stand in the open areas at half-time for a cigarette.

The East Stand is distinctive in appearance as it does not cover the full length of the pitch, tapering before ending around 15yds before the extremity of the pitch. This is because the ground behind the stand is residential, and can not be built on. However, the gap is not as large as a similar truncation at Fir Park, for example, and is filled by flags.

Disabled supporters are accommodated in an enclosures at the front of both end stands.

==Other uses==

===Rugby Union===
Scotland have played two games at Rugby Park; against Tonga in November 2014 and Georgia on 26 November 2016. The match against Tonga was the first rugby union international match featuring a tier 1 nation to be played on artificial surface.

===In popular culture===

In August 1999, Rugby Park was used for a fictitious Scottish Cup semi-final in the Robert Duvall film &quot;A Shot at Glory&quot;. The film also starred former Kilmarnock striker Ally McCoist.

===Concert tours===

Rugby Park has also been used as a venue concert for several musical artists.

* Singer Rod Stewart performed live at Rugby Park in 2016
* Elton John performed live at Rugby Park in June 2005

===International football===
====International matches====

Four Scottish international matches have been staged at Rugby Park. Normally, Scotland international matches are played at Hampden Park, but two matches were played at Rugby Park while the south stand at Hampden was being rebuilt. During the 1997 match against Wales, Kilmarnock were able to parade the Scottish Cup at half time, having captured the trophy at Ibrox on the previous Saturday.

<text>The , also known as the Kanagawa incident and Richardson affair, was a political crisis that occurred in the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan during the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; on 14 September 1862. Charles Lennox Richardson, a British merchant, was killed by the armed retinue of Shimazu Hisamitsu, the regent of the Satsuma Domain, on a road in Namamugi near Kawasaki. 

Richardson&#x27;s killing sparked outrage among Europeans for violating their extraterritoriality in Japan, while the Japanese argued Richardson had disrespected Shimazu and was justifiably killed under the &quot;Kiri-sute gomen&quot; rule. British demands for compensation and failure by the Satsuma to respond resulted in the Bombardment of Kagoshima (or Anglo-Satsuma War) in August 1863.

== Course of events ==

On 14 September 1862, four British subjects – the Shanghai-based merchant Charles Lennox Richardson, two Yokohama-based merchants, Woodthorpe Charles Clark and William Marshall, and Marshall&#x27;s sister-in-law Margaret Watson Borradaile – were travelling on the Tōkaidō road in Japan en route to visit the Kawasaki Daishi temple near Kawasaki, though they were warned by officials to not travel along the Tokaido that day as the procession of a lord was going to pass through that day. Richardson had recently announced his retirement, and was visiting the temple with his friends en route back to England. The party had departed the treaty port of Yokohama at 2:30 pm by boat, crossing Yokohama harbour to Kanagawa village, to join their horses which had been sent ahead. They were travelling north through the nearby village of Namamugi (now part of Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama) when they encountered the large, armed retinue of Shimazu Hisamitsu, the regent and father of Shimazu Tadayoshi, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Satsuma Domain.

Shimazu was heading in the opposite direction to Richardson and his party, who continued to ride along the side of the road without dismounting until they reached the main body of the procession, which occupied the entire width of the road. Richardson, leading his party, rode up to the middle of Shimazu&#x27;s procession and did not dismount despite being gestured repeatedly to do so. Richardson was subsequently slashed and mortally wounded by one of the Satsuma bodyguards. Clark and Marshall were also severely wounded by the Satsuma but Borrodaile was not harmed, and the three rode away as fast as they could. Richardson fell from his horse and Shimazu gave the order for &quot;todome&quot; — the coup de grâce — to be given, with several samurai proceeding to hack and stab at Richardson with swords and lances. A post-mortem examination of Richardson&#x27;s body showed ten mortal wounds, and he was buried in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery, between the later graves of Marshall and Clark.

== Consequences of the Namamugi Incident ==

The Namamugi Incident caused a new political crisis in Japan during the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;, the period after the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate had ended its historic isolationist foreign policy known as &quot;sakoku&quot; and allowed the entry of foreigners. Japanese and Westerners were outraged by the incident, with these groups almost unanimously supportive and opposed to the killing, respectively.

Japanese reports accused Richardson of continuing to ride in the middle of the road, and trying to get between Shimazu&#x27;s litter and his bodyguards. In Japan, the &quot;samurai&quot; had a legal right known as &quot;kiri-sute gomen&quot; which allowed them to strike anyone of a lower class for perceived disrespect, which could have justified the killing by Shimazu&#x27;s retinue. The Japanese instanced Eugene Van Reed, an American who had dismounted and bowed before a &quot;daimyō&quot;″s train, as evidence that the insolent attitude of Lennox and his party had caused the incident. Van Reed&#x27;s conduct had appalled the Western community, who believed that Westerners should hold themselves with dignity before the Japanese, being at least the equal of any Japanese person. There were also later suggestions that Richardson had acted in a similar manner towards Chinese people while horseback riding in China, and according to the &quot;Japan Herald &quot;Extra&quot;&quot; of Tuesday 16 September 1862, he had been heard to say just before the incident, &quot;I know how to deal with these people&quot;. Richardson&#x27;s uncle was reportedly not surprised about his nephew&#x27;s demise, but blamed him for being reckless and stubborn. Frederick Wright-Bruce, the British envoy to China, remembered Richardson as an &quot;arrogant adventurer&quot;.

The incident sparked a scare in Japan&#x27;s foreign community, which was based in the Kannai district of Yokohama. Westerners argued that Lennox was protected in Japan by extraterritoriality under the Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty and were exempt from Japanese cultural requirements, meaning Richardson&#x27;s death under &quot;kiri-sute gomen&quot; was illegal. Many Western traders appealed to their governments to take punitive action against Japan. The British government demanded reparations from the &quot;Bakufu&quot; and from the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma, together with the arrest, trial and execution of the perpetrators. 

===Bombardment of Kagoshima===
By mid-1863, the British had become impatient that the reparations demands for the Namamugi Incident were still unmet. In July, the &quot;Bakufu&quot; reluctantly paid the British the sum of £100,000 (one-third of their annual revenue) in compensation, though this was mainly due to fear of naval bombardment against the Tokugawa capital city of Edo. The Satsuma Domain continued to ignore the British demands and refused to apologize for Richardson&#x27;s death.

On 15 August, a Royal Navy squadron entered the waters of Kagoshima, the capital city of the Satsuma Domain, to extract the demanded reparations for the Namamugi Incident by force. Meeting further prevarication, they seized several Satsuma ships as bargaining chips for future negotiations, but were unexpectedly fired upon by Satsuma coastal batteries. The squadron retaliated by destroying the Satsuma vessels and bombarding Kagoshima, which had been evacuated. The Satsuma batteries were gradually silenced, but the British ships were unable to sustain the bombardment and retreated two days later. Ultimately, the battle resulted in five killed on the Satsuma side, and eleven lives among the British (including, with a single cannon shot, both the captain and commander of the British flagship HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;). 

Satsuma&#x27;s material losses were substantial, with around 500 houses destroyed in Kagoshima, and three Satsuma steamships were sunk. The engagement caused much controversy in the British House of Commons, but Acting Vice Admiral Augustus Leopold Kuper&#x27;s conduct was eventually commended by the House. Kuper was advanced to Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1864 &quot;for his services at Kagoshima&quot;. Shimazu Hisamitsu was subsequently given the court title of &quot;Ōsumi no Kami&quot; (大隅守). 

The military stalemate resulted in a renegotiation between the British and Satsuma regarding the Namamugi Incident. The Satsuma admired the superiority of the Royal Navy and sought a trading relationship with Britain as a result. Later that year, the Satsuma paid the £25,000 () in compensation demanded by the British government with money borrowed from the &quot;Bakufu&quot;. The Satsuma never repaid the £25,000 to the &quot;Bakufu&quot; because the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown in the Meiji Restoration five years later, and British demands for the Shimazu&#x27;s bodyguards that had killed Richardson to be brought to trial were unfulfilled. The Bombardment of Kagoshima became known in Japan as the Anglo-Satsuma War (薩英戦争, &quot;Satsu-Ei Sensō&quot;).

== In popular culture ==
The Namamugi Incident was the basis of James Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;Gai-Jin&quot;. It is also partially referenced in the opening cutscene for the video game Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai, which depicts an unnamed Japanese port town being bombarded by a British warship in retaliation for two western merchants being murdered by samurai.

<text> (, &quot;customary measures&quot;) were a French system of measurement introduced by French Emperor Napoleon I in 1812 to act as compromise between the metric system and traditional measurements. The system was restricted to use in the retail industry and continued in use until 1840, when the laws of measurement from 1795 and 1799 were reinstituted.

==Rationale behind the new system==

In the five years immediately before the French First Republic introduced the metric system, every effort was made to make the citizens aware of the upcoming changes and to prepare them for it. The administration distributed tens of thousands of educational pamphlets, private enterprise produced educational games, guides, almanacs, and conversion aids, and metre standards were built into the walls of prominent buildings around Paris. The introduction was phased by district over the next few years, with Paris being the first district to change. The government also realised that the people would need metre rulers, but they had only provided 25,000 of the 500,000 rulers needed in Paris as late as one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure. To compensate, the government introduced incentives for the mass-production of rulers. Paris police reported widespread flouting of the requirement for merchants to use only the metric system. Where the new system was in use, it was abused, with shopkeepers taking the opportunity to round prices up and to give smaller measures.

Napoleon I, the French Emperor, disliked the inconvenience of surrendering the high factorability of traditional measures in the name of decimalisation, and recognised the difficulty of getting it accepted by the populace. Under the (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), he introduced a new system of measurement, the or &quot;customary measures&quot;, for use in small retail businesses. However, all government, legal, and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education.

The prototypes of the metric unit, the kilogram and the metre, enabled an immediate standardisation of measurement over the whole country, replacing the varying legal measures in different parts of the country, and even more across the whole of Europe. The new (known as the ) was defined as five hundred grams, and the new () was defined as two metres. Products could be sold in shops under the old names and with the old relationships to one another, but with metric-based and slightly changed absolute sizes. This series of measurements was called .

Napoleon&#x27;s decree was eventually revoked during the reign of King Louis Philippe I by the (law of 4 July 1837), which took effect on 1 January 1840, and reinstated the original metric system. This brought the system of to a legal end, though the remains in some informal use to this day.

==Permitted units==
The law authorised the following units of measure:

* The (fathom) was defined as exactly two metres and was as before divided into 6 (or &quot;feet&quot;) or 72 (inches). The was divided into 12 (or &quot;lines&quot;). The and , at precisely 333. mm and 27. mm, were about 2.6% larger than the previous Parisian measures and 9% larger than their English counterparts.
* The (ell), used to measure cloth, was defined as 120 centimetres, and divided into the (half an ell, or 60 cm) and the (third of an ell, or 40 cm). It was 1.3% larger than (118.48 cm) and 5.0% larger than its English counterpart (45 inches; 114.3 cm).
* The litre was subdivided like a British quart, into (literally, &quot;halves&quot;, being the equivalent of a pint of about sixteen fluid ounces), (literally, &quot;fourths&quot;, being the equivalent of a cup of about eight fluid ounces), (literally, &quot;eighths&quot;), and (literally, &quot;sixteenths&quot;, of about two fluid ounces).
* The , (bushel), was redefined as being an eighth of a hectolitre and with associated measures , and (double, half, and quarter bushels respectively). The original , like the English bushel, varied depending on the it was used, as well as the it was used.
* The , (pound), was defined as 500 grams, divided into 16 , (ounces), each being divided into 8 . Each gros being thought of as being composed of 72 , whose name is the same as in English. Hence, the livre was 9216 . The and were about 10% larger than their English counterparts, while the was 17% less than its English counterpart.

The did not include any units of length greater than the - the (10 km) remaining in use throughout this period.

<text>Sand casting, also known as sand molded casting, is a metal casting process characterized by using sand—known as &quot;casting sand&quot;—as the mold material. The term &quot;sand casting&quot; can also refer to an object produced via the sand casting process. Sand castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries. In 2003, over 60% of all metal castings were produced via sand casting.

Molds made of sand are relatively cheap, and sufficiently refractory even for steel foundry use. In addition to the sand, a suitable bonding agent (usually clay) is mixed or occurs with the sand. The mixture is moistened, typically with water, but sometimes with other substances, to develop the strength and plasticity of the clay and to make the aggregate suitable for molding. The sand is typically contained in a system of frames or mold boxes known as a flask. The mold cavities and gate system are created by compacting the sand around models called patterns, by carving directly into the sand, or via 3D printing.

==Basic process ==
There are five steps in this process:
#Place a pattern in sand to create a mold.
#Incorporate the pattern and sand in a gating system. Remove the pattern.
#Fill the mold cavity with molten metal.
#Allow the metal to cool.
#Break away the sand mold and remove the casting.

===Components===

====Patterns====
From the design, provided by a designer, a skilled &quot;pattern maker&quot; builds a &quot;pattern&quot; of the object to be produced, using wood, metal, or a plastic such as expanded polystyrene. Sand can be ground, swept or d into shape. The metal to be cast will contract during solidification, and this may be non-uniform due to uneven cooling. Therefore, the pattern must be slightly larger than the finished product, a difference known as &quot;contraction allowance&quot;. Different scaled rules are used for different metals, because each metal and alloy contracts by an amount distinct from all others. Patterns also have core prints that create registers within the molds into which are placed sand cores. Such cores, sometimes reinforced by wires, are used to create under-cut profiles and cavities which cannot be molded with the cope and drag, such as the interior passages of valves or cooling passages in engine blocks.

Paths for the entrance of metal into the mold cavity constitute the runner system and include the sprue, various feeders which maintain a good metal &#x27;feed&#x27;, and in-gates which attach the runner system to the casting cavity. Gas and steam generated during casting exit through the permeable sand or via risers, which are added either in the pattern itself, or as separate pieces.

====Tools====
In addition to patterns, the sand molder could also use tools to create the holes.
====Molding box and materials====
A multi-part molding box (known as a casting flask, the top and bottom halves of which are known respectively as the cope and drag) is prepared to receive the pattern. Molding boxes are made in segments that may be latched to each other and to end closures. For a simple object—flat on one side—the lower portion of the box, closed at the bottom, will be filled with a molding sand. The sand is packed in through a vibratory process called ramming, and in this case, periodically screeded level. The surface of the sand may then be stabilized with a sizing compound. The pattern is placed on the sand and another molding box segment is added. Additional sand is rammed over and around the pattern. Finally a cover is placed on the box and it is turned and unlatched, so that the halves of the mold may be parted and the pattern with its sprue and vent patterns removed. Additional sizing may be added and any defects introduced by the removal of the pattern are corrected. The box is closed again. This forms a &quot;green&quot; mold which must be dried to receive the hot metal. If the mold is not sufficiently dried a steam explosion can occur that can throw molten metal about. In some cases, the sand may be oiled instead of moistened, which makes casting possible without waiting for the sand to dry. Sand may also be bonded by chemical binders, such as furane resins or amine-hardened resins.

 Additive manufacturing (AM) can be used in the sand mold preparation, so that instead of the sand mold being formed via packing sand around a pattern, it is 3D-printed. This can reduce lead times for casting by obviating patternmaking. Besides replacing older methods, additive can also complement them in hybrid models, such as making a variety of AM-printed cores for a cavity derived from a traditional pattern.

====Chills====
To control the solidification structure of the metal, it is possible to place metal plates, &quot;chills&quot;, in the mold. The associated rapid local cooling will form a finer-grained structure and may form a somewhat harder metal at these locations. In ferrous castings, the effect is similar to quenching metals in forge work. The inner diameter of an engine cylinder is made hard by a chilling core. In other metals, chills may be used to promote directional solidification of the casting. In controlling the way a casting freezes, it is possible to prevent internal voids or porosity inside castings.

====Cores====
Cores are apparatus used to generate hollow cavities or internal features which cannot be formed using pattern alone in molding, cores are usually made using sand, but some processes also use permanent cores made of metal.

To produce cavities within the casting—such as for liquid cooling in engine blocks and cylinder heads—negative forms are used to produce &quot;cores&quot;. Usually sand-molded, cores are inserted into the casting box after removal of the pattern. Whenever possible, designs are made that avoid the use of cores, due to the additional set-up time, mass and thus greater cost.

With a completed mold at the appropriate moisture content, the box containing the sand mold is then positioned for filling with molten metal—typically iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, magnesium alloys, or various pot metal alloys, which often include lead, tin, and zinc. After being filled with liquid metal the box is set aside until the metal is sufficiently cool to be strong. The sand is then removed, revealing a rough casting that, in the case of iron or steel, may still be glowing red. In the case of metals that are significantly heavier than the casting sand, such as iron or lead, the casting flask is often covered with a heavy plate to prevent a problem known as &quot;floating the mold.&quot; Floating the mold occurs when the pressure of the metal pushes the sand above the mold cavity out of shape, causing the casting to fail.

After casting, the cores are broken up by rods or shot and removed from the casting. The metal from the sprue and risers is cut from the rough casting. Various heat treatments may be applied to relieve stresses from the initial cooling and to add hardness—in the case of steel or iron, by quenching in water or oil. The casting may be further strengthened by surface compression treatment—like shot peening—that adds resistance to tensile cracking and smooths the rough surface. And when high precision is required, various machining operations (such as milling or boring) are made to finish critical areas of the casting. Examples of this would include the boring of cylinders and milling of the deck on a cast engine block.

====Design requirements====
The part to be made and its pattern must be designed to accommodate each stage of the process, as it must be possible to remove the pattern without disturbing the molding sand and to have proper locations to receive and position the cores. A slight taper, known as draft, must be used on surfaces perpendicular to the parting line, in order to be able to remove the pattern from the mold. This requirement also applies to cores, as they must be removed from the core box in which they are formed. The sprue and risers must be arranged to allow a proper flow of metal and gasses within the mold in order to avoid an incomplete casting. Should a piece of core or mold become dislodged it may be embedded in the final casting, forming a &quot;sand pit&quot;, which may render the casting unusable. Gas pockets can cause internal voids. These may be immediately visible or may only be revealed after extensive machining has been performed. For critical applications, or where the cost of wasted effort is a factor, non-destructive testing methods may be applied before further work is performed.

==Processes==
In general, we can distinguish between two methods of sand casting; the first one using &quot;green sand&quot; and the second being the &quot;air set&quot; method.

===Green sand===

These castings are made using sand molds formed from &quot;wet&quot; sand which contains water and organic bonding compounds, typically referred to as clay. The name &quot;green sand&quot; comes from the fact that the sand mold is not &quot;set&quot;, it is still in the &quot;green&quot; or uncured state even when the metal is poured in the mold. Green sand is not green in color, but &quot;green&quot; in the sense that it is used in a wet state (akin to green wood). Contrary to what the name suggests, &quot;green sand&quot; is not a type of sand on its own (that is, not greensand in the geologic sense), but is rather a mixture of:

* silica sand (SiO2), chromite sand (FeCr2O4), or zircon sand (ZrSiO4), 75 to 85%, sometimes with a proportion of olivine, staurolite, or graphite.
* bentonite (clay), 5 to 11%
* water, 2 to 4%
* inert sludge 3 to 5%
* anthracite (0 to 1%)

There are many recipes for the proportion of clay, but they all strike different balances between moldability, surface finish, and ability of the hot molten metal to degas. Coal, typically referred to in foundries as sea-coal, which is present at a ratio of less than 5%, partially combusts in the presence of the molten metal, leading to offgassing of organic vapors. Green sand casting for non-ferrous metals does not use coal additives, since the CO created does not prevent oxidation. Green sand for aluminum typically uses olivine sand (a mixture of the minerals forsterite and fayalite, which is made by crushing dunite rock).

The choice of sand has a lot to do with the temperature at which the metal is poured. At the temperatures that copper and iron are poured, the clay is inactivated by the heat, in that the montmorillonite is converted to illite, which is a non-expanding clay. Most foundries do not have the very expensive equipment to remove the burned out clay and substitute new clay, so instead, those that pour iron typically work with silica sand that is inexpensive compared to the other sands. As the clay is burned out, newly mixed sand is added and some of the old sand is discarded or recycled into other uses. Silica is the least desirable of the sands, since metamorphic grains of silica sand have a tendency to explode to form sub-micron sized particles when thermally shocked during pouring of the molds. These particles enter the air of the work area and can lead to silicosis in the workers. Iron foundries expend considerable effort on aggressive dust collection to capture this fine silica. Various types of respiratory-protective equipment are also used in foundries.
The sand also has the dimensional instability associated with the conversion of quartz from alpha quartz to beta quartz at 680 °C (1250 °F). Often, combustible additives such as wood flour are added to create spaces for the grains to expand without deforming the mold. Olivine, chromite, etc. are therefore used because they do not have a phase transition that causes rapid expansion of the grains. Olivine and chromite also offer greater density, which cools the metal faster, thereby producing finer grain structures in the metal. Since they are not metamorphic minerals, they do not have the polycrystals found in silica, and subsequently they do not form hazardous sub-micron sized particles.

===&quot;Air set&quot; method===
The &quot;air set&quot; method uses dry sand bonded with materials other than clay, using a fast curing adhesive. The latter may also be referred to as no bake mold casting. When these are used, they are collectively called &quot;air set&quot; sand castings to distinguish them from &quot;green sand&quot; castings. Two types of molding sand are natural bonded (bank sand) and synthetic (lake sand); the latter is generally preferred due to its more consistent composition.

With both methods, the sand mixture is packed around a &quot;pattern&quot;, forming a mold cavity. If necessary, a temporary plug is placed in the sand and touching the pattern in order to later form a channel into which the casting fluid can be poured. Air-set molds are often formed with the help of a casting flask having a top and bottom part, termed the cope and drag. The sand mixture is tamped down as it is added around the pattern, and the final mold assembly is sometimes vibrated to compact the sand and fill any unwanted voids in the mold. Then the pattern is removed along with the channel plug, leaving the mold cavity. The casting liquid (typically molten metal) is then poured into the mold cavity. After the metal has solidified and cooled, the casting is separated from the sand mold. There is typically no mold release agent, and the mold is generally destroyed in the removal process.

The accuracy of the casting is limited by the type of sand and the molding process. Sand castings made from coarse green sand impart a rough texture to the surface, and this makes them easy to identify. Castings made from fine green sand can shine as cast but are limited by the depth to width ratio of pockets in the pattern. Air-set molds can produce castings with smoother surfaces than coarse green sand but this method is primarily chosen when deep narrow pockets in the pattern are necessary, due to the expense of the plastic used in the process. Air-set castings can typically be easily identified by the burnt color on the surface. The castings are typically shot blasted to remove that burnt color. Surfaces can also be later ground and polished, for example when making a large bell. After molding, the casting is covered with a residue of oxides, silicates and other compounds. This residue can be removed by various means, such as grinding, or shot blasting.

During casting, some of the components of the sand mixture are lost in the thermal casting process. Green sand can be reused after adjusting its composition to replenish the lost moisture and additives. The pattern itself can be reused indefinitely to produce new sand molds. The sand molding process has been used for many centuries to produce castings manually. Since 1950, partially automated casting processes have been developed for production lines.

===Cold box===
Cold box uses organic and inorganic binders that strengthen the mold by chemically adhering to the sand. This type of mold gets its name from not being baked in an oven like other sand mold types. This type of mold is more accurate dimensionally than green-sand molds but is more expensive. Thus it is used only in applications that necessitate it.

===No-bake molds===
No-bake molds are expendable sand molds, similar to typical sand molds, except they also contain a quick-setting liquid resin and catalyst. Rather than being rammed, the molding sand is poured into the flask and held until the resin solidifies, which occurs at room temperature. This type of molding also produces a better surface finish than other types of sand molds. Because no heat is involved it is called a cold-setting process. Common flask materials that are used are wood, metal, and plastic. Common metals cast into no-bake molds are brass, iron (ferrous), and aluminum alloys.

===Vacuum molding===

&quot;Vacuum molding&quot; (&quot;V-process&quot;) is a variation of the sand casting process for most ferrous and non-ferrous metals, in which unbonded sand is held in the flask with a vacuum. The pattern is specially vented so that a vacuum can be pulled through it. A heat-softened thin sheet () of plastic film is draped over the pattern and a vacuum is drawn (). A special vacuum forming flask is placed over the plastic pattern and is filled with a free-flowing sand. The sand is vibrated to compact the sand and a sprue and pouring cup are formed in the cope. Another sheet of plastic is placed over the top of the sand in the flask and a vacuum is drawn through the special flask; this hardens and strengthens the unbonded sand. The vacuum is then released on the pattern and the cope is removed. The drag is made in the same way (without the sprue and pouring cup). Any cores are set in place and the mold is closed. The molten metal is poured while the cope and drag are still under a vacuum, because the plastic vaporizes but the vacuum keeps the shape of the sand while the metal solidifies. When the metal has solidified, the vacuum is turned off and the sand runs out freely, releasing the casting.

The V-process is known for not requiring a draft because the plastic film has a certain degree of lubricity and it expands slightly when the vacuum is drawn in the flask. The process has high dimensional accuracy, with a tolerance of ±0.010 in for the first inch and ±0.002 in/in thereafter. Cross-sections as small as are possible. The surface finish is very good, usually between 150 and 125 rms. Other advantages include no moisture related defects, no cost for binders, excellent sand permeability, and no toxic fumes from burning the binders. Finally, the pattern does not wear out because the sand does not touch it. The main disadvantage is that the process is slower than traditional sand casting so it is only suitable for low to medium production volumes; approximately 10 to 15,000 pieces a year. However, this makes it perfect for prototype work, because the pattern can be easily modified as it is made from plastic.

===Fast mold making processes===
With the fast development of the car and machine building industry the casting consuming areas called for steady higher productivity. The basic process stages of the mechanical molding and casting process are similar to those described under the manual sand casting process. The technical and mental development however was so rapid and profound that the character of the sand casting process changed radically.

====Mechanized sand molding====
The first mechanized molding lines consisted of sand slingers and/or jolt-squeeze devices that compacted the sand in the flasks. Subsequent mold handling was mechanical using cranes, hoists and straps. After core setting the copes and drags were coupled using guide pins and clamped for closer accuracy. The molds were manually pushed off on a roller conveyor for casting and cooling.

====Automatic high pressure sand molding lines====
Increasing quality requirements made it necessary to increase the mold stability by applying steadily higher squeeze pressure and modern compaction methods for the sand in the flasks. In early fifties the high pressure molding was developed and applied in mechanical and later automatic flask lines. The first lines were using jolting and vibrations to pre-compact the sand in the flasks and compressed air powered pistons to compact the molds.

=====Horizontal sand flask molding=====
In the first automatic horizontal flask lines the sand was shot or slung down on the pattern in a flask and squeezed with hydraulic pressure of up to 140 bars. The subsequent mold handling including turn-over, assembling, pushing-out on a conveyor were accomplished either manually or automatically. In the late fifties hydraulically powered pistons or multi-piston systems were used for the sand compaction in the flasks. This method produced much more stable and accurate molds than it was possible manually or pneumatically. In the late sixties mold compaction by fast air pressure or gas pressure drop over the pre-compacted sand mold was developed (sand-impulse and gas-impact). The general working principle for most of the horizontal flask line systems is shown on the sketch below.

Today there are many manufacturers of the automatic horizontal flask molding lines. The major disadvantages of these systems is high spare parts consumption due to multitude of movable parts, need of storing, transporting and maintaining the flasks and productivity limited to approximately 90–120 molds per hour.

=====Vertical sand flaskless molding=====
In 1962, Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S (DISA-DISAMATIC) invented a flask-less molding process by using vertically parted and poured molds. The first line could produce up to 240 complete sand molds per hour. Today molding lines can achieve a molding rate of 550 sand molds per hour and requires only one monitoring operator. Maximum mismatch of two mold halves is . Although very fast, vertically parted molds are not typically used by jobbing foundries due to the specialized tooling needed to run on these machines. Cores need to be set with a core mask as opposed to by hand and must hang in the mold as opposed to being set on parting surface.

=====Matchplate sand molding=====
The principle of the matchplate, meaning pattern plates with two patterns on each side of the same plate, was developed and patented in 1910, fostering the perspectives for future sand molding improvements. However, first in the early sixties the American company Hunter Automated Machinery Corporation launched its first automatic flaskless, horizontal molding line applying the matchplate technology.

The method alike to the DISA&#x27;s (DISAMATIC) vertical molding is flaskless, however horizontal. The matchplate molding technology is today used widely. Its great advantage is inexpensive pattern tooling, easiness of changing the molding tooling, thus suitability for manufacturing castings in short series so typical for the jobbing foundries. Modern matchplate molding machine is capable of high molding quality, less casting shift due to machine-mold mismatch (in some cases less than ), consistently stable molds for less grinding and improved parting line definition. In addition, the machines are enclosed for a cleaner, quieter working environment with reduced operator exposure to safety risks or service-related problems.

=====Safety standards=====
With automated mold manufacturing came additional workplace safety requirements. Different voluntary technical standards apply depending on the geopolitical jurisdiction where the machinery is to be used.

======Canada======
Canada does not have a machine-specific voluntary technical standard for sand-mold making machinery. This type of machinery is covered by:

Safeguarding of machinery, CSA Z432. Canadian Standards Association. 2016.

In addition, the electrical safety requirements are covered by:

Industrial Electrical Machinery, CSA C22.2 No. 301. 2016.

======European Union======
The primary standard for sand-mold manufacturing equipment in the EU is:
Safety requirements for foundry moulding and coremaking machinery and plant associated equipment, EN 710. European Committee for Standardization (CEN).

EN 710 will need to be used in conjunction with EN 60204-1 for electrical safety, and EN ISO 13849-1 and EN ISO 13849-2 or EN 62061 for functional safety. Additional type C standards may also be necessary for conveyors, robotics or other equipment that may be needed to support the operation of the mold-making equipment.

======United States======
There is no machine-specific standard for sand-mold manufacturing equipment. The ANSI B11 family of standards includes some generic machine-tool standards that could be applied to this type of machinery, including:

* Safety of Machinery, ANSI B11.0. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2020.
* Performance Requirements for Risk Reduction Measures: Safeguarding and other Means of Reducing Risk, ANSI B11.19. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2019.
* Safety Requirements for the Integration of Machinery into a System, ANSI B11.20. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2017.
* Safety Requirements for Transfer Machines, ANSI B11.24. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2002 (R2020).
* Functional Safety for Equipment (Electrical/Fluid Power Control Systems) General Principles for the Design of Safety Control Systems Using ISO 13849-1, ANSI B11.26. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2018.
* Sound Level Measurement Guidelines, ANSI B11.TR5. American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 2006 (R2017).

== Mold materials ==
There are four main components for making a sand casting mold: &quot;base sand&quot;, a &quot;binder&quot;, &quot;additives&quot;, and a &quot;parting compound&quot;.

===Molding sands===
&quot;Molding sands&quot;, also known as &quot;foundry sands&quot;, are defined by eight characteristics: refractoriness, chemical inertness, permeability, surface finish, cohesiveness, flowability, collapsibility, and availability/cost.

Refractoriness — This refers to the sand&#x27;s ability to withstand the temperature of the liquid metal being cast without breaking down. For example, some sands only need to withstand if casting aluminum alloys, whereas steel needs a sand that will withstand . Sand with too low refractoriness will melt and fuse to the casting.

Chemical inertness — The sand must not react with the metal being cast. This is especially important with highly reactive metals, such as magnesium and titanium.

Permeability — This refers to the sand&#x27;s ability to exhaust gases. This is important because during the pouring process many gases are produced, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and steam, which must leave the mold otherwise casting defects, such as blow holes and gas holes, occur in the casting. Note that for each cubic centimeter (cc) of water added to the mold 1600 cc of steam is produced.

Surface finish — The size and shape of the sand particles defines the best surface finish achievable, with finer particles producing a better finish. However, as the particles become finer (and surface finish improves) the permeability becomes worse.

Cohesiveness (or bond) — This is the ability of the sand to retain a given shape after the pattern is removed.

Flowability – The ability for the sand to flow into intricate details and tight corners without special processes or equipment.

Collapsibility — This is the ability of the sand to be easily stripped off the casting after it has solidified. Sands with poor collapsibility will adhere strongly to the casting. When casting metals that contract a lot during cooling or with long freezing temperature ranges a sand with poor collapsibility will cause cracking and hot tears in the casting. Special additives can be used to improve collapsibility.

Availability/cost — The availability and cost of the sand is very important because for every ton of metal poured, three to six tons of sand is required. Although sand can be screened and reused, the particles eventually become too fine and require periodic replacement with fresh sand.

In large castings it is economical to use two different sands, because the majority of the sand will not be in contact with the casting, so it does not need any special properties. The sand that is in contact with the casting is called &quot;facing sand&quot;, and is designed for the casting on hand. This sand will be built up around the pattern to a thickness of . The sand that fills in around the facing sand is called &quot;backing sand&quot;. This sand is simply silica sand with only a small amount of binder and no special additives.

====Types of base sands====
&quot;Base sand&quot; is the type used to make the mold or core without any binder. Because it does not have a binder it will not bond together and is not usable in this state.

=====Silica sand=====

Silica (SiO2) sand is the sand found on a beach and is also the most commonly used sand. It is either made by crushing sandstone or taken from natural occurring locations, such as beaches and river beds. The fusion point of pure silica is , however the sands used have a lower melting point due to impurities. For high melting point casting, such as steels, a minimum of 98% pure silica sand must be used; however for lower melting point metals, such as cast iron and non-ferrous metals, a lower purity sand can be used (between 94 and 98% pure).

Silica sand is the most commonly used sand because of its great abundance, and, thus, low cost (therein being its greatest advantage). Its disadvantages are high thermal expansion, which can cause casting defects with high melting point metals, and low thermal conductivity, which can lead to unsound casting. It also cannot be used with certain basic metals because it will chemically interact with the metal, forming surface defects. Finally, it releases silica particulates during the pour, risking silicosis in foundry workers.

=====Olivine sand=====
Olivine is a mixture of orthosilicates of iron and magnesium from the mineral dunite. Its main advantage is that it is free from silica, therefore it can be used with basic metals, such as manganese steels. Other advantages include a low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, and high fusion point. Finally, it is safer to use than silica, therefore it is popular in Europe.

=====Chromite sand=====
Chromite sand is a solid solution of spinels. Its advantages are a low percentage of silica, a very high fusion point (), and a very high thermal conductivity. Its disadvantage is its costliness, therefore it is only used with expensive alloy steel casting and to make cores.

=====Zircon sand=====
Zircon sand is a compound of approximately two-thirds zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and one-third silica. It has the highest fusion point of all the base sands at , a very low thermal expansion, and a high thermal conductivity. Because of these good properties it is commonly used when casting alloy steels and other expensive alloys. It is also used as a mold wash (a coating applied to the molding cavity) to improve surface finish. However, it is expensive and not readily available.

=====Chamotte sand=====
Chamotte is made by calcining fire clay (Al2O3-SiO2) above . Its fusion point is and has low thermal expansion. It is the second cheapest sand, however it is still twice as expensive as silica. Its disadvantages are very coarse grains, which result in a poor surface finish, and it is limited to dry sand molding. Mold washes are used to overcome the surface finish problems. This sand is usually used when casting large steel workpieces.

===Binders===
&quot;Binders&quot; are added to a base sand to bond the sand particles together (i.e. it is the glue that holds the mold together).

====Clay and water====
A mixture of clay and water is the most commonly used binder. There are two types of clay commonly used: bentonite and kaolinite, with the former being the most common.

====Oil====
Oils, such as linseed oil, other vegetable oils and marine oils, used to be used as a binder, however due to their increasing cost, they have been mostly phased out. The oil also required careful baking at to cure (if overheated, the oil becomes brittle, wasting the mold).

====Resin====
Resin binders are natural or synthetic high melting point gums. The two common types used are urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. PF resins have a higher heat resistance than UF resins and cost less. There are also cold-set resins, which use a catalyst instead of a heat to cure the binder. Resin binders are quite popular because different properties can be achieved by mixing with various additives. Other advantages include good collapsibility, low gassing, and they leave a good surface finish on the casting.

MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) is also a commonly used binder resin in the foundry core process.

====Sodium silicate====

Water glass ( sodium silicate [Na2SiO3 or (Na2O)(SiO2)] ) is a high strength binder used with silica molding sand both for cores and molds. To cure a mixture of finely ground sand (e.g. by using a sand muller) and 3 to 4% of sodium silicate the binder, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is used. The mixture is exposed to the gas at ambient temperature reacting as following:

:&lt;chem&gt;{Na2O(SiO2)} + CO2 &lt;=&gt; {Na2CO3} + {2SiO2} + Heat&lt;/chem&gt;

The advantage to this binder is that it can be used at room temperature and is fast. The disadvantage is that its high strength leads to shakeout difficulties and possibly hot tears (probably due to quartz inversion) in the casting. The mixed sodium silicate and sand may also be heated by a heat gun to achieve better rigideness.

===Additives===
Additives are added to the molding components to improve: surface finish, dry strength, refractoriness, and &quot;cushioning properties&quot;.

Up to 5% of &quot;reducing agents&quot;, such as coal powder, pitch, creosote, and fuel oil, may be added to the molding material to prevent wetting (prevention of liquid metal sticking to sand particles, thus leaving them on the casting surface), improve surface finish, decrease metal penetration, and burn-on defects. These additives achieve this by creating gases at the surface of the mold cavity, which prevent the liquid metal from adhering to the sand. Reducing agents are not used with steel casting, because they can carburize the metal during casting.

Up to 3% of &quot;cushioning material&quot;, such as wood flour, sawdust, powdered husks, peat, and straw, can be added to reduce scabbing, hot tear, and hot crack casting defects when casting high temperature metals. These materials are beneficial because burn-off when the metal is poured creates tiny voids in the mold, allowing the sand particles to expand. They also increase collapsibility and reduce shakeout time.

Up to 2% of &quot;cereal binders&quot;, such as dextrin, starch, sulphite lye, and molasses, can be used to increase dry strength (the strength of the mold after curing) and improve surface finish. Cereal binders also improve collapsibility and reduce shakeout time because they burn off when the metal is poured. The disadvantage to cereal binders is that they are expensive.

Up to 2% of iron oxide powder can be used to prevent mold cracking and metal penetration, essentially improving refractoriness. Silica flour (fine silica) and zircon flour also improve refractoriness, especially in ferrous castings. The disadvantages to these additives is that they greatly reduce permeability.

===Parting compounds===
To get the pattern out of the mold, prior to casting, a parting compound is applied to the pattern to ease removal. They can be a liquid or a fine powder (particle diameters between ). Common powders include talc, graphite, and dry silica; common liquids include mineral oil and water-based silicon solutions. The latter are more commonly used with metal and large wooden patterns.

==History==
Clay molds were used in ancient China since the Shang dynasty ( to 1046 BC). The famous Houmuwu ding (c. 1300 BC) was made using clay molding.

The Assyrian king Sennacherib (704–681 BC) cast massive bronzes of up to 30 tonnes, and claims to have been the first to have used clay molds rather than the &quot;lost-wax&quot; method:

Whereas in former times the kings my forefathers had created bronze statues imitating real-life forms to put on display inside their temples, but in their method of work they had exhausted all the craftsmen, for lack of skill and failure to understand the principles they needed so much oil, wax and tallow for the work that they caused a shortage in their own countries—I, Sennacherib, leader of all princes, knowledgeable in all kinds of work, took much advice and deep thought over doing that work. Great pillars of bronze, colossal striding lions, such as no previous king had ever constructed before me, with the technical skill that Ninushki brought to perfection in me, and at the prompting of my intelligence and the desire of my heart I invented a technique for bronze and made it skillfully. I created clay moulds as if by divine intelligence...twelve fierce lion-colossi together with twelve mighty bull-colossi which were perfect castings... I poured copper into them over and over again; I made the castings as skillfully as if they had only weighed half a shekel each

In 1206, Ismail al-Jazari first described the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand. Sand casting molding method was recorded by Vannoccio Biringuccio in his book published around 1540.

In 1924, the Ford Motor Company set a record by producing 1 million cars, in the process consuming one-third of the total casting production in the U.S. As the automobile industry grew the need for increased casting efficiency grew. The increasing demand for castings in the growing car and machine building industry during and after World War I and World War II, stimulated new inventions in mechanization and later automation of the sand casting process technology.

There was not one bottleneck to faster casting production but rather several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley &amp; Piper. In 1912, the first sand mixer with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the &quot;D-process&quot; was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand process in which the cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came out

In the 2010s, additive manufacturing began to be applied to sand mold preparation in commercial production; instead of the sand mold being formed via packing sand around a pattern, it is 3D-printed.

<text>Charles James Shavers (August 3, 1920 – July 8, 1971) was an American jazz trumpeter who played with Dizzy Gillespie, Nat King Cole, Roy Eldridge, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone, Sidney Bechet, Midge Williams, Tommy Dorsey, and Billie Holiday. He was also an arranger and composer, and one of his compositions, &quot;Undecided&quot;, is a jazz standard.

==Career==
Shavers&#x27;s father, a distant relative of Fats Navarro, was from the Shavers family of Key West, Florida. Charlie Shavers was a cousin of heavyweight boxer Earnie Shavers. Born in New York City, he took up piano and banjo before switching to trumpet. In the mid-1930s, he performed with Tiny Bradshaw and Lucky Millinder. In 1935, he played in the trumpet section with Dizzy Gillespie and Carl (Bama) Warwick in Frankie Fairfax&#x27;s Campus Club Orchestra. In 1936, he joined John Kirby&#x27;s Sextet as trumpet soloist and arranger. He was only 16, but gave his birth date as 1917 to avoid child labor laws; many biographies still list this date.

Shavers&#x27;s arrangements and solos helped make the band one of the most commercially successful and imitated of its day. In 1937, he performed with Midge Williams and her Jazz Jesters. In 1944, he began playing sessions in Raymond Scott&#x27;s CBS staff orchestra. In 1945, he left John Kirby&#x27;s band to join Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s Orchestra, with whom he toured and recorded, off and on, until Dorsey&#x27;s passing in 1956. In 1949, he sang and played the hit &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot; with the Dorsey Orchestra. He can be seen as a member of Dorsey&#x27;s Orchestra on numerous &quot;Stage Show&quot; telecasts for CBS, including early Elvis Presley appearances. During this time he also continued to play at CBS; he also appeared with the Metronome All-Stars, and made a number of recordings as trumpet soloist with Billie Holiday. From 1953 to 1954, he worked with Benny Goodman and toured Europe with Norman Granz&#x27;s popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, where he was a crowd favorite. He formed his own band with Terry Gibbs and Louie Bellson.

Shavers died from throat cancer in New York in 1971 at the age of 50. His friend Louis Armstrong died while Shavers was on his deathbed, and his last request was that his trumpet mouthpiece be buried with Armstrong.

<text>Drum Corps Associates (DCA) was a governing body for modern all-age and senior drum and bugle corps in North America. Its responsibilities included sanctioning competitions, certifying adjudicators, maintaining and enforcing rules of competition, and hosting an annual World Championship during Labor Day weekend. Historically, DCA members were referred to as &quot;senior corps&quot; in contrast to the &quot;junior corps&quot;, who limit participants to a maximum 22 years of age. As DCA had no age restriction, the term &quot;all-age corps&quot; has come into common use.

On May 31, 2023, Drum Corps International and DCA announced a partnership to create an all-age class for the 2024 and 2025 competitive seasons. In August 2023, DCA announced that the all-age drum corps platform will fully exist and operate within DCI from 2024 onward. As such, 2023 was the final year of the Drum Corps Associates World Championships.

== History ==
In August 1963, Almo Sebastianelli, sponsor of the annual Parade of Champions drum corps competition, approached Henry Mayer, then-director of the New York Skyliners, to discuss problems affecting show sponsors and competing corps. Following their discussions, Sebastianelli and Mayer organized a meeting later that month, which was attended by representatives from the Archer-Epler Musketeers, Reading Buccaneers, Yankee Rebels, and the New York Skyliners. Five areas of concern were identified during the meeting:
* &quot;Conflicting contest dates.&quot;
* &quot;Inconsistent contest formats.&quot;
* &quot;Inconsistent adjudication.&quot;
* &quot;Uneven distribution prize money.&quot;
* &quot;Need to promote better relationships between competing corps.&quot;

At a second meeting held sometime in September 1963, by-laws for a new governing body were adopted, as well as the adoption of the name Drum Corps Associates. Mayer was elected the first DCA president. Charter members were: Reading Buccaneers, Connecticut Hurricanes, Interstatesmen, Archer-Epler Musketeers, Pittsburgh Rockets, Yankee Rebels, and the New York Skyliners.

DCA sanctioned one event in 1964, the 12th Annual Tournament of Drums in Waverly, New York. The first DCA World Championship was held in Milford, Connecticut on September 11, 1965. The Reading Buccaneers won the first of their 16 championship titles at this inaugural event.

Hawthorne Caballeros joined DCA in 1966, along with the Sunrisers, and Brigadiers. The Rochester Crusaders joined in 1967. Two decades later, in 1987, the number of corps competing in Open Class grew to 23. In 2008, twenty-four corps competed at World Championship, twelve in Open Class and Class A each.

Corps from Canada had been frequent competitors since DCA&#x27;s founding, such as Les Metropolitains from Montreal, and Les Dynamiques from Buckingham, Quebec. The Kingston Grenadiers, from Toronto, competed in 2010. Yokohama Inspires, from Japan, competed in 2005. The last competitors from the United Kingdom were Kidsgrove Scouts from Kidsgrove in 2017, and Cadence from Guildford in 2018.

=== Past championship locations ===
== Classification and adjudication ==
DCA assigned all competing corps to four classes. No arrangements are made for corps from outside North America, as the same classification and adjudication applies to all competing corps. With the exception of mini-corps, all field corps performed in competition as one continuous flight, but scores and rankings were given by class.

=== Current Classes ===
World Class corps typically marched between 86 and 128 members who compete at the highest level.

Open Class corps typically marched between 65 and 85 members.

A Class corps were small, often young and developing groups, who typically marched between 24 and 64 members.

Mini-corps was a special class reserved for very small groups consisting of horns, and percussion or rhythm sections. These groups typically competed on a theater stage, and not on a football field, and were often no larger than twenty members. A Mini-corps championships was held the day before World Championship prelims.

==== Historical classes and divisions ====
DCA realigned its competitive classes in 1997, and again in 2001. In 2022, DCA realigned its competitive classes based on ensemble size—World, Open, and A classes.

=== Adjudication ===
DCA&#x27;s Adjudication Manual was based on three broad categories, Visual, Music and Effect. Visual and Music categories were further subdivided into three reference criteria, or captions: one caption for each of a corps&#x27; sections, and two ensemble performance captions. Unlike other adjudication manuals, DCA&#x27;s manual included captions for individual or ensemble analysis, or design or effect analysis.

The manual included definitions for appropriate, and achievement, in lieu of proficiency, or attempt. This vocabulary reflects the style of programming utilized by modern all-age corps. Audience entertainment and engagement are also important factors in adjudication as well. Prior to 2011, nine adjudicators were required for each competition, using a different manual. The &quot;European Music Games&quot; adjudication manual published by Drum Corps Europe (DCE) was adapted from the previous DCA format.

== Past champions ==
Below is a list of past champions organized by class. DCA realigned its championships classes in 1997 with the introduction of A Class, and again in 2000 with the introduction of Mini-corps into competition. In 2022, DCA realigned classes based on ensemble size which split DCA member corps between three new divisions—World, Open, and A classes.

At the 2022 World Championships, the Hurricanes won their fourth class championship: three championships in Open Class between 1967 and 1981, and a fourth as champions of the new Open Class. Also in 2022, the Buccaneers won World Class bringing their premier class championships to eighteen, and Fusion Core won their second championship in A Class.

2023 marked the final year of the Drum Corps Associates World Championships, in which the Buccaneers, Hurricanes, Rogues Hollow Regiment, and Freelancers took first in World Class, Open Class, A Class, and Mini-corps respectively.

<text>Tynecastle Park, also known as Tynecastle Stadium, is a football stadium in the Gorgie area of Edinburgh, which is the home ground of Scottish Professional Football League club Heart of Midlothian (Hearts). A UEFA category four stadium, it has also hosted Scotland international matches, and been used as a neutral venue for Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup semi-finals.

Tynecastle has a seating capacity of , which makes it the sixth-largest football stadium in Scotland. Hearts have played at the present site of Tynecastle since 1886.

==History==
===Heart of Midlothian===
After Hearts was formed in 1874, the club played at sites in the Meadows, Powburn and Powderhall. Hearts first moved to the Gorgie area, in the west of Edinburgh, in 1881. This pitch, known as &quot;Tynecastle Park&quot; or &quot;Old Tynecastle&quot;, stood on the site of the present-day Wardlaw Street and Wardlaw Terrace. As this site was then regarded as being &#x27;out of town&#x27;, Hearts would sometimes stage two matches for the price of one, or set an admission price much lower than Edinburgh derby rivals Hibs. In 1886, with the city continuing to expand, tenements replaced the old ground and Hearts moved across Gorgie Road to the present site (also known as &quot;Tynecastle Park&quot;, or &quot;New Tynecastle&quot;), which was leased from Edinburgh Corporation. Hearts played a friendly against Bolton Wanderers to inaugurate their new home on 10 April 1886. Tynecastle staged its first Scottish Football League match on 23 August 1890, when Hearts lost 5–0 to Celtic.

Hearts won the Scottish Cup in 1891, which provided the club with sufficient finances for a new clubhouse. Tynecastle hosted its first international fixture in 1892, a 6–1 victory for Scotland against Wales. Only 1,200 fans attended the match because a snowstorm had led many fans to assume that it would be postponed. 1892 also saw a roof constructed on the original &quot;South&quot; stand. In 1895 Tynecastle hosted a &quot;World Championship&quot; match between the winner of the English Football League First Division, Sunderland, and the Scottish league champions, Hearts. The trophy was won by Sunderland, who beat Hearts by a 5–3 score. Tynecastle hosted another &quot;World Championship&quot; game in 1902, when Hearts beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–1.

===Redevelopment===
Tynecastle underwent substantial changes in the early twentieth century. A small stand and pavilion were built in 1903. The banks of terracing were greatly increased in 1906, giving a total capacity of 61,784. In 1911, a covered enclosure was erected on the western &quot;distillery&quot; side. The two old stands and pavilion were replaced in 1914 by a pitch-length grandstand (the present Main Stand), designed by the stadium architect Archibald Leitch. To partly fund the cost of the new stand, Hearts sold Percy Dawson to Blackburn Rovers for a British record transfer fee of £2,500. A number of items were omitted from the first estimate of the stand, which meant that its cost doubled to £12,000.

Hearts purchased the ground in 1926. Over the next four years, the terraces were expanded using ash from the nearby Haymarket railway yards. In 1927, Hearts gave the BBC permission to begin radio commentaries from the ground. New turnstiles were built on Wheatfield Street and subways created to allow access to the terraces. Tynecastle&#x27;s record attendance was achieved in 1932, when 53,396 attended a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers. Tynecastle was now tightly squeezed on three sides, however, by narrow streets, Tynecastle High School and bonded warehouses of the North British Distillery. Hearts considered moving to Murrayfield Stadium, which had opened in 1925. There was also a proposal to move to a new ground in Sighthill. The start of the Second World War halted these schemes, however.

The terraces were concreted in 1951 and Tynecastle became Scotland&#x27;s first all-concrete stadium in 1954. Following the modernisation of the stadium, the club architects said that the capacity stood at 54,359, but for safety reasons only 49,000 tickets were printed and sold for big matches. Floodlights were installed at Tynecastle in 1957. A roof was constructed along part of the &quot;distillery&quot; side and in the north-west corner of the ground in 1959. This work was paid for by the sale of Dave Mackay for £32,000 to Tottenham Hotspur.

No further changes were made to Tynecastle until stricter ground safety regulations came into effect in the 1970s. Hearts also lacked the finances to redevelop Tynecastle, as the club were relegated from the Premier Division three times in five seasons in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Hearts began to perform better under the ownership of Wallace Mercer, who took control in 1981. The capacity was cut to 29,000 with the installation of benches on the &quot;distillery&quot; covered terrace and in the Main Stand paddock in 1982 and 1985 respectively. Also around this time, lounges and facilities were installed in the Main Stand.

===Safety upgrades===
The Taylor Report required all major sports grounds to become all-seated by August 1994. Hearts initially entered discussions with Hibernian and the local authorities, but none of the sites suggested were suitable for all parties. In March 1991, Hearts submitted their own proposal for a 30,000 all-seat stadium at Millerhill, in the south-east of Edinburgh. The development would have also incorporated offices, a hotel, supermarket, restaurants and a business park. The site was in the Edinburgh green belt, however, and the proposal was rejected later in 1991. Hermiston was then suggested as a possible site for a new Hearts stadium, but this fell through in December 1992 as it was also within the green belt area.

The collapse of the Hermiston proposal forced Hearts to redevelop Tynecastle instead. In 1994, the entire western and northern sides of the ground were demolished, allowing for the construction of the Wheatfield Stand that year and the Roseburn Stand the following year. Temporary &#x27;bucket&#x27; seating was installed on the (southern) Gorgie Road end terracing. That terracing was itself razed in 1997 and replaced by the Gorgie Stand. During this period of redevelopment, the ground was officially renamed as Tynecastle Stadium.

===Sale and Hearts ownership===

In 2004, then club CEO Chris Robinson announced plans to sell Tynecastle, which he claimed was &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. Hearts would have rented Murrayfield from the SRU instead. The prime motivation for this move was to eradicate the club&#x27;s debt of nearly £20 million. The plan was almost universally unpopular with supporters, and a campaign, entitled &quot;Save Our Hearts&quot;, was set up to try to block the move. In spite of this, Robinson and those supporting his actions controlled a slender majority of the issued shares and it appeared that a sale would be completed, particularly after a deal was preliminarily agreed to sell the site for just over £20 million to Cala Homes, a property development company.

The sale was cancelled, however, when Vladimir Romanov purchased the club in January 2005, invoking a clause in the initial agreement that allowed for its annulment upon the payment of a fixed sum of £75,000. Later in 2005, the pitch dimensions were altered to meet UEFA standards, necessitating the removal of the lowest rows of seating in the Gorgie and Roseburn Stands. As a result, the overall capacity was reduced from 18,000 to 17,420. On 20 August 2007 the club announced they were &quot;at an advanced stage&quot; in plans for demolishing the aged Main Stand and replacing it with a 10,000 seat stand, including a hotel and leisure facilities. A planning application was lodged with Edinburgh City Council in February 2008. This development would have increased capacity to 23,000, but the proposal did not proceed due to the state of the club&#x27;s finances.

===Redevelopment plans===

The plans for redevelopment of the main stand were rekindled in December 2015, when Hearts owner Ann Budge said work on the new stand would commence as soon as possible. Hearts submitted plans in March 2016 to Edinburgh Council, proposing a new 7000-seat stand. The plans also include a nursery, alongside space for a club shop, ticket office and admin office. Construction began during the latter part of the 2016–17 season. In April, Hearts announced their intention to restore the original name of Tynecastle Park when the new stand is opened. The project was initially expected to be completed by September 2017, but construction delays meant that four home fixtures had to be moved to Murrayfield. Tynecastle re-opened on 19 November, for a league game against Partick Thistle.

==Structure and facilities==

Tynecastle is an all-seated stadium, split into four sections known as the Gorgie Stand, Main Stand, Wheatfield Stand and Roseburn Stand. The Main Stand was rebuilt in 2017, replacing an older facility designed by noted football stadium architect Archibald Leitch. The three other stands were constructed between 1994 and 1997, with all having a distinctive goalpost roof structure made out of steel tubes. Unusually, the framework sits at the front of each stand, which means that the support towers sit within 10 yards of the corner flag, forming an arch over the stand. The stadium floodlights sit on top of the support towers, angled down towards the pitch, like the lighting rigs used at concerts. The Wheatfield Stand, which seats just under 6,000 people, slopes at just under 34 degrees, the maximum angle permitted. The Roseburn Stand (School End) was completed in August 1995 and cost £1.4 million to build. The Roseburn Stand seated 3,676 when it was opened, but 280 seats were removed from both it and the Gorgie Stand when the pitch was lengthened in 2005 to meet UEFA requirements. The Gorgie Stand, which was completed in September 1997, contains the Gorgie Suite.

==Other uses==

===Other football matches ===

Tynecastle has been a home venue for the Scotland national football team on nine occasions. It regularly played host to the British Home Championship match with Wales, which was considered to have the least box-office potential and was often played outside Glasgow. After the Second World War, however, the Scottish Football Association favoured playing all home matches at Hampden Park, unless exceptional circumstances prevented Scotland playing there. More recently, Tynecastle has become the home of the Scotland women&#x27;s national football team.

Tynecastle has been used as a neutral venue for domestic cup semi-finals on numerous occasions, most frequently when these games involve teams from the east or north-east of Scotland (such as Aberdeen, Dundee United or Hibernian). At one stage during the 1920s, Tynecastle hosted a Scottish Cup semi-final in four consecutive years. In total 19 Scottish Cup semi-finals (not including replays) and 11 League Cup semi-finals have been staged at the ground.

However, since the advent of regular live television coverage caused semi-finals to be played at different times, it has been SFA policy to stage both Scottish Cup semi-finals at Hampden, where possible. League Cup semi-finals are still staged at smaller venues depending upon the participants. The last Scottish Cup semi-final hosted at Tynecastle was Aberdeen&#x27;s defeat of Hibernian in 1992–93. The most recent League Cup semi-final was in 2015–16, when Hibernian won 2–1 against St Johnstone.

Tynecastle was a venue when Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA U-16 World Championship. Initial group-stage matches were sparsely attended, however, on 20 June 1989, 28,555 spectators watched Scotland defeat a Portugal side containing Rui Costa and Luís Figo 1–0 in the semi-final. Scotland went on to lose the final to Saudi Arabia.

====Full internationals====



===Rugby league===

The Gorgie ground has also hosted rugby league matches on four occasions. The first, in 1911, was an Ashes match between Great Britain and Australia, during the 1911–12 Kangaroo tour, and ended in an 11–11 draw. The next came eight decades later with the newly created Super League again attempting to promote the sport in Scotland, moved two league fixtures to Tynecastle. The 1998 meeting between London Broncos and Bradford Bulls drawing over 7,000 fans, and the 1999 fixture between Gateshead Thunder and Wigan Warriors before a smaller crowd. The final and most recent came during the Rugby League World Cup between Scotland and Samoa, which the Samoans won 20–12.

=== Music ===
On 2 August 2019, Tynecastle Park hosted the opening event of the 2019 Edinburgh International Festival. The Los Angeles Philharmonic led by Gustavo Dudamel played a selection of Hollywood film scores, including Jurassic Park, Star Wars, E.T. and Jaws. Over 15,000 free tickets were issued and the concert was live-streamed on Facebook, and broadcast on Classic FM.

=== Theatre ===
The stage play &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot;, which dramatized the real-life women&#x27;s association football club formed during World War I by North British Rubber Co. workers in its Fountainbridge factory, was performed at the 2021 Edinburgh Festival Fringe festival on a stage built on the stadium&#x27;s main stand, with the pitch as its backdrop.

<text>Matthew Adam Garber (25 March 1956 – 13 June 1977) was a British child actor, most notable as Michael Banks in the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. His other screen credits include &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot; (1967), appearing alongside actress Karen Dotrice in all three films they made for Walt Disney Pictures.

==Early life==
Born in Stepney, London, to parents who had both performed on stage, Garber attended St Paul&#x27;s Primary School in Winchmore Hill and Highgate School in Highgate, North London, from September 1968 until July 1972. He had a younger brother, Fergus Garber, who was born in 1964, the year Matthew played Michael Banks. His father&#x27;s name was recorded by the school he had attended as Louis Leonard Garber. Matthew Garber was considered a spirited and bright boy in a 1967 Disney press release that noted his enjoyment of pulling practical jokes on his friends, playing sports, and reading adventure, mythology and poetry books.

==Career==

A friend of the Garber family, Karen Dotrice&#x27;s father, Shakespearean actor Roy Dotrice, called Garber to the attention of Disney Casting, where his use of &quot;artful dodges, like squinting, screwing up his nose, and brushing his hair back with one hand&quot; led to his screen debut at age seven in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (1963).

That same year, both Garber and &quot;Thomasina&quot; co-star Dotrice were hired to play Jane and Michael, the 
children of Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) and Mrs. Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns), who get more than they bargained for when they hire a nanny named Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews). Disney&#x27;s live-action animated film adaptation of the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; book series by P. L. Travers won five Academy Awards and made its stars world-famous.

Garber and Dotrice teamed up one last time in 1967 in &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot;, as the grandchildren of a rich lumber mogul (Walter Brennan) who stumble across a gnome forest and are asked to help keep the gnomes from dying off.

Dotrice recalled, &quot;He was how he looked—an imp, and I loved being his shadow. I can&#x27;t imagine making movies would have been half as much fun without him. He loved being naughty, finding and jumping off of small buildings on the back lot. While I was Victorian proper and wouldn&#x27;t let myself get dirty or muddy, Matthew had a great sense of fun and danger. He was a daredevil and could have been a race car driver. And he did live a full life over his 21 years.&quot;

==Illness and death==
In 1976, Garber contracted hepatitis while in India. By the time his father brought him back to London, the disease had spread to his pancreas.
He died on 13 June 1977 at the age of 21 in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, of haemorrhagic necrotising pancreatitis. His body was cremated at St. Marylebone Crematorium (East Finchley, London) three days later.

==Legacy==
Garber was posthumously named a Disney Legend in 2004, with his brother Fergus accepting the award on his behalf. On the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; 40th anniversary DVD, Karen Dotrice said she regretted not having kept in touch with Garber before his death.

<doc id="1082018" wikidata="Q790433" url="?curid=1082018" title="Challah">
<text>Challah or hallah ( ; , ; [&quot;c&quot;]&quot;hallot&quot;, [&quot;c&quot;]&quot;halloth&quot; or [&quot;c&quot;]&quot;hallos&quot;, ), also known as berches in Central Europe, is a special bread in Jewish cuisine, usually braided and typically eaten on ceremonial occasions such as Shabbat and major Jewish holidays (other than Passover).

Ritually acceptable challah is made of dough from which a small portion has been set aside as an offering. Challah may also refer to the dough offering. The word is biblical in origin, meaning &quot;loaf&quot;. Similar (usually braided) breads with mainly the same ingredients include brioche, kalach, kozunak, panettone, pulla, tsoureki, vánočka found across European cuisines.

==Name and origins==
The term in Biblical Hebrew meant a kind of loaf or cake. The targum is (pl. , var. ) which also means loaf. The word derives from the root (), which means &quot;pierced.&quot; According to , &quot;challah&quot; was a sort of bread with a central hole, designed to hang over a post.

In Rabbinic terminology, &quot;challah&quot; often refers to the portion of dough which must be separated before baking, and set aside as a tithe for the Kohen, since the biblical verse which commands this practice refers to the separated dough as a &quot;challah&quot;. The practice of separating this dough sometimes became known as &quot;separating challah&quot; () or &quot;taking challah&quot;. The food made from the balance of the dough is also called &quot;challah.&quot; The obligation applies to any loaf of bread, not only to the Shabbat bread, but it is traditional to intentionally bake bread for the Sabbath in such a manner as to obligate oneself, in order to dignify the Shabbat. By synecdoche, the term &quot;challah&quot; came to refer to the whole of the loaf from which &quot;challah&quot; is taken.

There is no consensus as to the source of challah’s braided form. Author of A Blessing of Bread, Maggie Glezer, writes that the braiding began in 15th century Austria and Southern Germany, &quot;with Jewish housewives following their non-Jewish counterparts, who plaited the loaves they baked on Sundays&quot;. The braids were meant to symbolize the Sabbath bride’s hair, according to Professor Hasia R. Diner. Another food historian Hélène Jawhara Piñer, a scholar of medieval Sephardic cuisine, has suggested that a recipe for a leavened and braided bread found in a 13th century Arabic cookbook from Spain, the &quot;Kitāb al-ṭabīẖ&quot;, may have been a precursor to challah. However, while this bread closely resembles the preparation of challah, it was flavored with saffron and fried, was described in the book as &#x27;the making of braids,&#x27; translated into Spanish as ″&quot;guedejas&quot;″, and can be translated to Hebrew as ″&quot;peot&quot;″. According to Piñer&#x27;s analysis, following their expulsion from Spain, Sephardic Jews brought this bread northward through Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries.

===Variant names===

Challah may also be referred to as &quot;cholla&quot; bread. In Poland it is commonly known as (pronounced ; diminutive of ), in Ukraine as &quot;kolach&quot; or &quot;khala&quot; and () in Belarus and Russia.

Yiddish communities in different regions of Europe called the bread , or , , , , or , or . Some of these names are still in use today, such as in South Africa.

The term &quot;koylatch&quot; is cognate with the names of similar braided breads which are consumed on special occasions by other cultures outside the Jewish tradition in a number of European cuisines. These are the Russian &quot;kalach&quot;, the Serbian , the Ukrainian kolach the Hungarian (in Hungary, the Jewish variant is differentiated as Bárhesz), and the Romanian . These names originated from Proto-Slavic &quot;kolo&quot; meaning &quot;circle&quot;, or &quot;wheel&quot;, and refer to the circular form of the loaf.

In the Middle East, regional Shabbat breads were simply referred to by the local word for bread, such as in Farsi or in Arabic.

==Ingredients and preparation==
Most traditional Ashkenazi challah recipes use numerous eggs, fine white flour, water, sugar, yeast, oil (such as vegetable or canola), and salt, but &quot;water challah&quot; made without eggs and having a texture like French baguette also exists, which is typically suitable for those following vegan diets. Modern recipes may replace white flour with whole wheat, oat, or spelt flour or sugar with honey or molasses.

According to Sephardic Jewish observance of halachah, a bread with too much sugar changes the status of the bread to cake. This would change the blessing used over the bread from Hamotzi (bread) to Mezonot (cake, dessert breads, etc.) which would invalidate it for use during the Kiddush for Shabbat. While braided breads are sometimes found in Sephardic cuisine, they are typically not challah but are variants of regional breads like çörek, eaten by Jews and non-Jews alike.

Egg challah sometimes also contains raisins and/or saffron. After the first rising, the dough is rolled into rope-shaped pieces which are braided, though local (hands in Lithuania, fish or hands in Tunisia) and seasonal (round, sometimes with a bird&#x27;s head in the centre) varieties also exist. Poppy or sesame (Ashkenazi) and anise or sesame (Sephardi) seeds may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top. Both egg and water challah are usually brushed with an egg wash before baking to add a golden sheen.

Challah is almost always pareve (containing neither dairy nor meat—important in the laws of Kashrut), unlike brioche and other enriched European breads, which contain butter or milk as it is typically eaten with a meat meal.

Israeli breads for shabbat are very diverse, reflecting the traditions of Persian, Iraqi, Moroccan, Russian, Polish, Yemeni, and other Jewish communities who live in the State of Israel. They may contain eggs or olive oil in the dough as well as water, sugar, yeast, salt, honey and raisins. It may be topped with sesame or other seeds according to various minhagim.

==Rituals and religious significance==

According to Jewish tradition, the three Sabbath meals (Friday night, Saturday lunch, and Saturday late afternoon) and two holiday meals (one at night and lunch the following day) each begin with two complete loaves of bread. This &quot;double loaf&quot; (in Hebrew: ) commemorates the manna that fell from the heavens when the Israelites wandered in the desert after the Exodus. The manna did not fall on Sabbath or holidays; instead, a double portion would fall the day before the holiday or sabbath to last for both days. While two loaves are set out and the blessing is recited over both, most communities only require one of them to be cut and eaten.

In some Ashkenazi customs, each loaf is woven with six strands of dough. Together, the loaves have twelve strands, alluding to the twelve loaves of the showbread offering in the Temple. Other numbers of strands commonly used are three, five and seven. Occasionally, twelve are used, referred to as a &quot;Twelve Tribes&quot; challah. Some individuals – mostly Hasidic rabbis – have twelve separate loaves on the table.

Challot - in these cases extremely large ones - are also sometimes eaten at other occasions, such as a wedding or a Brit milah, but without ritual.

===Traditional Sabbath meal procedure===

It is customary to begin the evening and day Sabbath and holiday meals with the following sequence of rituals:
* The challah is covered, customarily with a dedicated challah cover cloth. (Normally, in the order of saying blessings, bread would precede wine. Covering the challah allows the Kiddush blessing to come first.)
* Kiddush is recited over a cup of wine.
* Each attendee ritually washes their hands in preparation for eating bread. (In some communities the hands are washed before the Kiddush. It is customary not to talk between this washing and consumption of the bread.)
* The challah cover is removed.
* The two loaves are held up together.
* The head of the household recites the blessing over bread: &quot;&quot; (Translation: &quot;Blessed are you  our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth bread from the earth&quot;).
* The bread (one or two, depending on minhag) is sliced (or torn) and salted, and the pieces are distributed to each person at the meal to eat.

The specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread. Others say the blessing, cut or tear the challah into pieces, and only then dip the pieces in salt, or sprinkle them with salt, before they are eaten. Some communities may make a nick in the bread with a cutting knife.

Normally, the custom is not to talk between washing hands and eating bread. However, according to some, if salt was not placed on the table, it is permitted to ask for someone to bring salt, before the blessing on bread is recited.

====Salting====
Salting challah is considered a critical component of the meal. Customs vary whether the challah is dipped in salt, salt is sprinkled on it, or salt is merely present on the table. This requirement applies to any bread, though it is observed most strictly at Sabbath and holiday meals.

The Torah requires that Temple sacrifices to God be offered with salt. Following the destruction of the Second Temple, Rabbinic literature suggested that a table set for a meal symbolically replaces the Temple altar; therefore, the blessing over food should only be recited with salt present on the table. Should one eat a meal without performing a commandment, the covenant of salt protects him.

To the rabbis, a meal without salt was considered no meal. Furthermore, in the Torah, salt symbolizes the eternal covenant between God and Israel. As a preservative, salt never spoils or decays, signifying the immortality of this bond.

==Special challah==

===Rosh Hashanah===
On Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, the challah may be rolled into a circular shape (sometimes referred to as a &quot;turban challah&quot;), symbolizing the cycle of the year, and is sometimes baked with raisins in the dough. Some have the custom of continuing to eat circular challah from Rosh Hashana through the holiday of Sukkot. In the Maghreb (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria) many Jews will simply bake their challah in the shape of &quot;turban challah&quot; year-round.

Sometimes the top is brushed with honey to symbolize the &quot;sweet new year.&quot; According to some traditions, challah eaten on Rosh Hashana is not dipped in or sprinkled with salt but instead is dipped in or sprinkled with honey. As above, some continue to use honey instead of salt through the Sukkot holiday.
=== challah===
For the &quot;Shabbat Mevarchim&quot; preceding Rosh Chodesh Iyar (i.e., the first &quot;Shabbat&quot; after the end of Passover), some Ashkenazi Jews have the custom of baking challah (&quot;key challah&quot;) as a &quot;segula&quot; (propitious sign) for (livelihood). Some make an impression of a key on top of the challah before baking, some place a key-shaped piece of dough on top of the challah before baking, and some bake an actual key inside the challah.

The earliest written source for this custom is the of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel (1748–1825), published in 1863. He refers to challah as a preexisting custom and offers several kabbalistic interpretations.

The custom has been criticized for allegedly having its source in Christian or pagan practices.

===Challah rolls===
Challah rolls, known as a or or or (plural: ; ) or (Polish) is a bread roll made with eggs, similar to a challah bun. It is often used as the bread for Shabbat or holiday meals.

==Similar breads==
Similar braided, egg-enriched breads are made in other traditions. The Romanian colac is a similar braided bread traditionally presented for holidays and celebrations such as Christmas caroling . The Polish is similar, though sweeter than challah. The Czech vánočka and Slovak vianočka is very similar and traditionally eaten at Christmas. In Bulgarian and Romanian cuisine there is a similar bread called cozonac (Bulgarian: ), while tsoureki bread (also known as or ) is popular in Armenian, Greek and Turkish cuisines. A sweet bread called &quot;milibrod&quot; (Macedonian: ), similarly braided as the challah, is part of the dinner table during Orthodox Easter in Macedonia. Zopf is a similar bread from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with a sweeter variant known as or . In Finnish cuisine, pulla (also known as cardamom bread in English) is a small braided pastry seasoned with cardamom that is very popular in Finnish cafés. Brioche is an egg-enriched bread, but it is not braided.

Unlike challah, which by convention is pareve, many of these breads also contain butter and milk.

<text>Mouseland is a political fable first told by Clarence Gillis in 1944, and later and most famously by Tommy Douglas, leader of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) that became the New Democratic Party of Canada, both social democratic parties. The story is about a nation of mice voting for either black cats or white cats to run their country, and expresses the CCF&#x27;s view that the Canadian political system was flawed in offering voters a false dichotomy: the choice of two parties, neither of which represented their interests.

==Synopsis==
The mice voted in black cats, which represented the Progressive Conservative Party, and then they found out how hard life was. Then they voted in the white cats, which symbolized the Liberal Party and things were different, but still not good for mice, because the government was still run by cats; subsequently they alternated the two, then they tried a coalition, and ultimately spotted cats were voted in which sought to sound like mice. A mouse got an idea that mice should run their government, not the cats, was accused of being a Bolshevik, and was imprisoned. The concluding point was that one can lock up a mouse or a person, but one cannot lock up an idea.

==Variations==
A variation of this story is told in Douglas Adams&#x27; novel &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;, involving a democracy where people vote for lizards as their leaders. No one is happy with this situation, except for the lizards, but the people continue voting for the lizards &quot;because if they didn&#x27;t vote for a lizard ... the wrong lizard might get in&quot;.

In 2006, Brad Wall, Leader of the Saskatchewan Party, the opposition party in Saskatchewan, parodied Mouseland, a place in which the mice govern as destructive creatures, as an attack on the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party. In 2010, Wall carried his parody further by giving &quot;A Mouseland Update&quot; to the Saskatchewan Party&#x27;s Annual Convention.

<text>Bountiful is a settlement in the Creston Valley of southeastern British Columbia, Canada, near Cranbrook and Creston. The closest community is Lister, British Columbia.

Bountiful is made up of members of two polygamist Mormon fundamentalist groups. The settlement is named after Bountiful in the Book of Mormon.

==History==
The first member of the group that bought property near Lister was Harold Michael Blackmore, who moved there with his family in 1946. Other members of the church who believed in the principle of plural marriage soon followed. After Winston Blackmore became the bishop in the 1980s, the group took the name of Bountiful.

Bountiful&#x27;s estimated population was 600 in 1998 and has since grown to about 1,000. Most of the residents are descended from only half a dozen men.

Bountiful&#x27;s Mormon fundamentalists have divided into two groups: about half are members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church), and the rest are members of the Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc., an FLDS offshoot based on the teachings of Blackmore, who split with the FLDS Church after concluding the president of the church, Warren Jeffs, had exceeded his authority and become too dictatorial. The FLDS bishop is James Oler.

==Allegations of abuse==
On April 19, 2005, Bountiful&#x27;s leaders held an extensive press conference in an effort to dispel many of the allegations of abuse that had surrounded their community.

Bountiful has come under intense scrutiny for its involvement in the polygamous FLDS Church. Warren Jeffs, who was one of the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, is thought to have visited a dozen or so times in 2005. On January 28, 2006, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; released information that Utah&#x27;s attorney general was collaborating with British Columbia&#x27;s attorney general in attempting to deal with polygamy and the alleged abuse in these communities. Jeffs was captured by the authorities outside Las Vegas in August 2006 during a routine traffic stop. On September 25, 2007, he was found guilty of being an accomplice to rape. Prosecutors said Jeffs forced a 12-year-old girl into marriage and sex with her 19-year-old first cousin. Jeffs faced 5 years to life in prison on each of two felony charges. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said, &quot;Everyone should now know that no one is above the law; religion is not an excuse for abuse, and every victim has a right to be heard.&quot;

On May 16, 2006, Blackmore&#x27;s family invited the media to visit in response to a recent visit by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indicating that they felt persecuted. Three of Blackmore&#x27;s putative wives could face deportation, as they are U.S. citizens and would not be considered legally married to a Canadian.

On June 6, 2007, the province of British Columbia announced the appointment of high-profile Vancouver criminal lawyer Richard Peck as a special prosecutor to review the results of a police investigation into possible polygamous activity or other offences by members of the community. On August 1, 2007, Peck concluded that there was not enough evidence to charge the group with sexual abuse or exploitation charges, as it had been extraordinarily difficult to find victims willing to testify, and the defendants were likely to claim &quot;religious freedom&quot; as a defence.

Peck suggested that British Columbia ask the courts whether current polygamy laws, specifically section 293 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, are constitutional. Peck said that it was time to find out whether Canada&#x27;s polygamy laws would stand. He said, &quot;If the law is upheld, members of the Bountiful community will have fair notice that their practice of polygamy must cease.&quot; The Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld Canada&#x27;s polygamy laws in a 2011 reference case.

In July 2017, two men from the FLDS community, Blackmore and Oler, were convicted of one count each of polygamy. Blackmore and Oler are the third and fourth people in Canada history to be convicted of polygamy. Blackmore was found to have married 24 women and fathered 149 children. In June 2018, both men were given house arrest as a result of their convictions. Blackmore received 6 months&#x27; house arrest followed by 18 months&#x27; probation, while Oler received 3 months&#x27; house arrest and 12 months&#x27; probation.

In August, 2017, Brandon James Blackmore and Emily Ruth Gail Blackmore were convicted of removing an underage girl from Canada for marriage in the United States. They were sentenced to 12 months and seven months in jail, respectively, followed by probation of 18 months, for transporting a 13-year-old girl to the U.S. in 2004 for marriage to Warren Jeffs. Oler was a third defendant in this case and was acquitted, which was successfully challenged by the Crown. In an August 2019 new trial, Oler was convicted of the same child removal charge and sentenced to 12 months in jail and 18 months&#x27; probation. During the trial, records revealed that Jeffs had directed Oler on June 23, 2004, to bring a 15-year-old to the U.S. for marriage. As of August 2011, Jeffs had been sentenced to life in prison for sexually assaulting two underage followers taken as brides.

<doc id="1082043" wikidata="Q720921" url="?curid=1082043" title="John Collins (footballer, born 1968)">
<text>John Angus Paul Collins (born 31 January 1968) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder.

He played for Hibernian, Celtic, AS Monaco, Everton and Fulham in a 19-year career. Collins also represented Scotland 58 times, scoring in the opening match of the 1998 FIFA World Cup against Brazil.

He started his coaching career as manager of Hibernian, winning the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final, but resigned later that year. He then had a brief spell as manager of Charleroi in 2009. Collins was appointed director of football at Livingston in February 2012, but resigned a year later. He then assisted Ronny Deila at Celtic for two years. Collins has also worked in media coverage of football.

==Playing career==
===Hibernian===
As a youngster, Collins played both rugby union and football before turning his attention entirely to football. At youth level, he played for Hutchison Vale between 1980 and 1984, captaining the side for four years, before signing as a professional with Hibernian. Collins played with the &quot;Hibees&quot; for six seasons, making his debut in 1985 aged 17, appearing 195 times and scoring 21 goals. During his spell at Easter Road, he was named the PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year for 1988.

===Celtic===
Collins signed for Celtic in 1990, becoming their first million pound player. He generally played on the left side of midfield, scoring 55 goals in 273 appearances. In April 1994, he became the first professional footballer using Adidas Predator boots to score a goal in a top-level match: he scored the opening goal of a 1–1 draw at Ibrox against Rangers, direct from a free-kick on the edge of the penalty box. He repeated that feat from almost the same position in the next Old Firm meeting at the same venue in August of the same year. During his time at Celtic he won only one trophy; the Scottish Cup in 1995.

===Monaco===
Collins moved to AS Monaco in the summer of 1996 on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling; Under the direction of Fergus McCann, Celtic attempted to obtain compensation for the loss of Collins, arguing that the Bosman ruling did not apply to this case because AS Monaco were based in the principality of Monaco and outside of European Union jurisdiction. The compensation claim was not successful.

Collins won the French championship in 1997 with Monaco, who then reached the semi-final of the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League, defeating Manchester United in the quarter-final before losing to Juventus.

===Later career===
Collins moved to Everton in the summer of 1998 for £2 million. He captained Everton before submitting a transfer request in 2000. He then joined Fulham, where he linked up with Jean Tigana, who had been his manager at Monaco. Collins helped Fulham gain promotion to the Premier League in 2001. He retired in 2003, having not played regularly during the 2002–03 season. Coventry City offered to sign Collins on loan, but this offer was refused by Fulham because it did not cover his wages fully.

In February 2014, Collins registered as a player with Gala Fairydean Rovers, a club who he had been ambassador for.

===International===
Collins won 58 caps and scored 12 goals for Scotland. He played for his country at Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup. He scored a goal in the opening match of that World Cup, with a penalty kick against Brazil. He retired from international football after the aggregate defeat in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs by England in November 1999.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from club football in 2003, Collins spent time in Monaco with his family, while also obtaining coaching qualifications including the UEFA Pro Licence.

On 31 October 2006, Collins was appointed as manager of Hibernian. Collins led Hibernian to their first national trophy in over 15 years, when they defeated Kilmarnock 5–1 in the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final. Despite the League Cup victory, Collins had a major dispute with his players just weeks later. A delegation of players met chairman Rod Petrie, where they complained about his training methods and match tactics. The players soon backed down and captain Rob Jones offered a public apology to Collins on their behalf.

On 20 December 2007, Collins resigned from Hibernian with immediate effect, citing a disagreement with the Hibs board about the budget to bring in new players. His decision was taken just one day after the club opened new training facilities. Collins had also said in October 2007 that he had &quot;no intention&quot; of breaking his contract with Hibs, after turning down a possibility of becoming Queens Park Rangers manager.

Lawrie Sanchez was sacked by Fulham the next day, which led to reports that Collins might move there. Collins distanced himself from this speculation, and Roy Hodgson was appointed by Fulham a week later. Collins was interviewed by West Ham United in September 2008.

On 15 December 2008, Collins was appointed as the manager of Belgian club Charleroi. Collins was reunited with former Hibs striker Abdessalam Benjelloun, but Benjelloun was almost immediately returned to Hibs before being loaned to another Belgian club, Roeselare. Collins announced his departure from Charleroi after the club secured their First Division status near the end of the season.

Collins was appointed director of football by Livingston in February 2012. He agreed to play for his old amateur club Gala Rovers in a friendly against a Livingston XI on 25 July 2012. He left the club on 28 February 2013, after Collins disagreed with a decision to remove Gareth Evans from first team coaching.

In June 2014, Collins was appointed to the position of assistant manager at Celtic. He left the club at the end of the 2015–16 season, at the same time as Ronny Deila.

==Media work==
Collins has appeared on the Sky Sports coverage of the UEFA Champions League and Sportscene&#x27;s coverage of Scotland games. He worked for CBC Sports during their coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

<doc id="1082045" wikidata="Q7685830" url="?curid=1082045" title="Targa timing">
<text>Targa timing (not to be confused with target timing) is a system of timing used in car rallying. It was invented by John Brown, the Clerk of the Course for the Targa Rusticana, a road rally (named after the Italian Targa Florio) organised in Wales in the 1960s by Oxford University Motor Drivers Club. Targa timing became the standard timing method used on rallies for almost 20 years following its invention in 1963. However, it was eventually banned as it became widely abused—the standard method by which organisers could set very high average speeds in a manner that left no permanent record.

== History ==
In all rallies, competitors run against the clock, rather than directly against each other. The winner is the crew losing the fewest penalties for failing to maintain the set average speeds (either under or over). However, determining this result in a fair and logistically feasible manner can be quite a challenge, especially as events may cover a wide area and be broken up into many different sections. Targa timing was one of the practical timing systems developed to allow rapid and accurate results calculation to take place.

By the early 1960s, competitors would carry a sealed watch with them, and show it to the marshal at time controls along the route, who would record the time. The system worked, but was open to tampering and a variety of tricks employed by competitors to cheat. To combat this, the system changed so that each marshal would have his own clock, each of which had been synchronised at the start of the event. In a standard timed event, run to so-called BBC or &quot;telecom&quot; time, each clock would simply show the time of day to the nearest second. A characteristic of this type of timing is that the average speeds calculated for each section are easy to compute, and if this involved breaking the law with respect of speed limits, etc., it could cause problems for organisers, since it could be seen as an incitement. A competitor&#x27;s time card would list the actual times and stand as a permanent record of the speeds at which they had driven to attain them. In addition, computing results was a slow and laborious process.

Targa timing solved these problems. On a targa-timed event, each clock is not synchronised to all of the others. Instead, each successive clock is retarded behind by the exact amount that the competitor is due to take to reach that clock en route. Thus, if they are exactly on time, the clock will show exactly the same time at every time control they visit, making it very easy to see whether they are ahead or behind, and if so by how much. In addition, since on most events cars are started at one-minute intervals, and the cars are numbered and started in sequence, the time shown on the clock will be their competition number if they are on time. To clarify this, imagine a notional car &quot;0&quot; which starts the event at time 00:00 at every point on the route, if they are on time, the clocks will always show 0:00:00. Likewise car 1 will see 0:01:00, car 2 sees 0:02:00 and so on. If Car 1 sees a time of 0:05:XX, they know instantly that they have lost at least four minutes. Incidentally, this is the origin of rally competition numbering skipping numbers 60–99, then continuing with 100, (1:00:00 on the clock) which corresponds to a due time of +1 hour. This is still occasionally seen, though it can be a problem for public relations, leading naturally but incorrectly to perceptions of there being &quot;hundreds of cars&quot; in a rally.

=== Issues ===
The original objective of targa timing was to speed delivery of rally results, and the rally paperwork set out the amount by which each control&#x27;s clock was offset. This always remained the case on the Targa Rusticana, but other organisers soon realised that targa timing could be used to conceal the calculated average speed for a section, since the competitors have no way of knowing by how much each clock has been retarded. This in turn led to a further use of targa timing which in practice was its true advantage to organisers—it allowed them to, untraceably, set very high average speeds for competitive driving. This in turn led to the concept of a &quot;target&quot; or &quot;bogey&quot; time for a section, known only to the organisers—the upshot was that crews basically needed to drive as fast as possible to stay on time. The participants&#x27; time cards only showed the recorded targa time, and not the actual time taken, so it was not possible to use it as a permanent record of the speeds driven; no record was left that could incriminate anyone after the event.

For road rallies, targa timing was banned in 1988, along with a number of other rule changes designed to slow such events down—from then on only ordinary &quot;time of day&quot; timing was permitted. Many of the &#x27;old school&#x27; competitors lament this change, though organisers have found new ways to keep events fun and challenging for entrants.

<text>Didicas Volcano is an active volcanic island in the province of Cagayan in northern Philippines. The island, which was a submarine volcano and re-emerged from the sea in 1952, is NE of Camiguin Island, one of the Babuyan Islands in Luzon Strait. Before 1952, the volcano first breached the ocean surface in 1857.

==Physical features==
Didicas is topped with a lava dome with an elevation of and a base diameter of at sea level. It is at the southern end of the Luzon Volcanic Arc, and like all the volcanoes in the Philippines, is part of the Pacific ring of fire.

==Eruption history==
There have been six historical eruptions recorded from the volcano since the 18th century.

*1773: The first recorded submarine eruption from the volcano, on what was known as Didicas reefs of the Farallones.
*1856 September or October: The first activity started as a column of &quot;smoke&quot; in between the two rocks well known to the locals, but no earthquakes were felt.
*1857: The volcano erupted violently, attended by earthquakes, then broke the surface of the sea. From then to 1860, the volcano was constantly active and in four years had reached a height of . The island was later washed out by the waves and disappeared beneath the sea.
*1900: An eruption left three rock masses up to high.
*1952: The volcano broke the ocean&#x27;s surface again during an eruption that started around March 16.
*1953: The activities subsided. The resulting island is wide with an elevation of .
*1969: First known fatalities from the volcano: three fishermen were killed while fishing near the volcano. The activity, which started on March 21, came from a new crater on the northern side of the island. Air reconnaissance over the volcano reported bubbling mud on the wide bottom of the crater. Activity on the volcano waned in June.
*1978 January 6 to 9: The last eruption of Didicas to date. The mild eruption blanketed the island with volcanic ash.

<doc id="1082058" wikidata="Q133932" url="?curid=1082058" title="Tetragonia">
<text>Tetragonia is a genus of 51 species of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae, native to temperate and subtropical regions mostly of the Southern Hemisphere, in New Zealand, Australia, southern and eastern Africa, and western South America, and eastern Asia.

==Description==
Plants of the genus &quot;Tetragonia&quot; are herbs or small shrubs. Leaves are alternate and succulent, with flowers typically yellow and small in size. Flowers can be axillary, solitary or fasciculate, greenish or yellowish in colour and mostly bisexual. Fruit are initially succulent but become dry and woody with age. The genus name comes from &quot;tetragonus&quot;, meaning &quot;four-angled&quot; and referring to the shape of the plants&#x27; fruits.

==Distribution==
About forty species of &quot;Tetragonia&quot; are found in southern Africa, from Angola to South Africa. They also occur in Australia, eastern Africa (Kenya and Ethiopia), western south America (Peru and Chile), and Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, southern China, Myanmar, and Vietnam).

==Classification==
The genus was first formally described by the botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in the work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Synonyms for the genus include &quot;Tetragonocarpos&quot; Mill., &quot;Demidovia&quot; Pall., and &quot;Tetragonella&quot; Miq.

==Human use and cultivation==
The best known species of &quot;Tetragonia&quot; is the leafy vegetable food crop, &quot;Tetragonia tetragonoides&quot; (&quot;New Zealand spinach&quot;). New Zealand spinach is widely cultivated as a summer leafy vegetable.

Some of the other species are also eaten locally, such as &quot;Tetragonia decumbens&quot; (&quot;Dune spinach&quot;) which is a local delicacy in its native southern Africa.

==Species==
51 species are accepted.

<text>Twilight Circus is the dub and reggae project of multi-instrumentalist Ryan Moore, former bassist and drummer of the Legendary Pink Dots. Twilight Circus is becoming increasingly popular and well known for Moore&#x27;s work with artists such as Big Youth, Michael Rose of Black Uhuru and Ranking Joe. He originally started off producing dub albums, before recording vocalists for inclusion on his critically acclaimed Foundation Rockers album. In the classic tradition of reggae, Moore releases 10&quot; vinyl record singles, often in limited edition.

With Twilight Circus, Ryan Moore has worked with a wide range of respected figures from the dub, reggae and electronic genres including: Sly and Robbie, Dean Fraser, Luciano, Michael Rose (Black Uhuru), Mikey General, Big Youth, Skully Simms, Vin Gordon (The Wailers), Gaudi, Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith (The Wailers), Eddie &#x27;Tan Tan&#x27; Thornton (Aswad), Buttons Tenyue /Matics Horns (UB40), Ansel Collins, Style Scott (Dub Syndicate), Bobby Ellis (Studio One), Admiral Tibet, Jah Stitch, Sugar Minott, Queen Ifrica, Lutan Fyah, Fred Locks, Gregory Isaacs, Mafia &amp; Fluxy, Cevin Key (Skinny Puppy), DJ Spooky, and The Mad Professor.

Moore&#x27;s fascination with dub began in the early 1980s, inspired by the nexus of punk rock and dub which film maker Don Letts forged in London, along with the futuristic possibilities hinted at by cyberpunk author William Gibson in Neuromancer. Throughout the 80&#x27;s he obsessively collected every dub LP he could find, which included Jamaican dub from legends like King Tubby, Prince Jammy, Lee Perry and Scientist as well as 2nd-generation figures operating from London like Adrian Sherwood, Mad Professor, and Jah Shaka. Some of his early dub experiments from the mid-80&#x27;s are to be heard on the ROIR release &#x27;Twilight Circus - Dub From The Secret Vaults&#x27;.

In 1994 Vancouver&#x27;s Miller Block studio collective, owner / operator Darryl Neudorf handed Ryan Moore the keys to the studio for after hours sessions, where the first Twilight Circus album &quot;Ín Dub Vol.1&quot; began to take shape. From 1994 to the present Moore has made recordings for Twilight Circus in Vancouver, London, Kingston-Jamaica, and The Netherlands - where he had his own studio.

Since being the opening act for Skinny Puppy side project Download on their 1996 World tour and several tours billed with the Legendary Pink Dots, Twilight Circus has maintained a busy schedule playing all over the World on nearly every continent, including major festivals like Dour Festival, Summerjam, Fuji Rock Festival, One Love (UK), Asagiri Jam, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, Vancouver Folk Music Festival.

<text>Grant Gillon is a former New Zealand politician. He was a member of parliament between 1996 and 2002, representing the Alliance Party, has held a number of seats in local government. He previously served on the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board representing Shore Action.

He is a former senior lecturer in paramedicine and emergency management at the Auckland University of Technology.

==Political career==


Gillon&#x27;s political career began when he joined the Democratic Party. In 1991, the Democratic party joined the Alliance as one of the four founding parties. In the , Gillon stood in the electorate and came third.

Gillon was elected to Parliament as an Alliance list MP in the 1996 election, having been ranked in eleventh place on the party list. He was re-elected to Parliament in the 1999 election. While an MP, Gillon was a Government Whip, Deputy Chair of the Government Administration Select Committee, members of the MMP Review Committee, a member of the Privileges, Officers of Parliament, Standing Orders, Members&#x27; Services, Business, Parliamentary Services, Legislative, Cabinet and other parliamentary committees.

In 2001, Gillon became leader of the Democratic Party, replacing John Wright.

When the Alliance collapsed in 2002, Gillon and the Democratic Party joined Jim Anderton&#x27;s breakaway party, the Progressive Coalition. In the 2002 election, Gillon was ranked third on the Progressive Coalition list, behind Jim Anderton and Matt Robson. Gillon resigned as leader and left the party altogether and moved to the Progressive Coalition after the Democratic Party members voted to leave the Progressive Coalition. Gillon became President of the Progressive Coalition until he stood down in 2007.

He has served as the North Shore City Councillor (representing the Harbour Ward and Chair of the Strategy and Finance Committee) and Birkenhead/Northcote Community Board member, elected to both the City Council and Community Board.

Gillon is a past chief executive officer for the ISEA union for teachers and past member of the board of directors of the state-owned enterprise AsureQuality.

Gillon has also worked as a dairy farmer, senior fire officer, and an entrepreneur in light manufacturing, printing, educational resource and publishing. As of 2017 he managed the Esplanade Hotel on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore.

During the 2016 Auckland elections, Gillon ran for the North Shore ward of the Auckland Council and missed out on a seat by 128 votes. He was re-elected to the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board as its chair.

He tried to win election to Auckland Council under the More for the Shore banner in the 2019 local body elections but was unsuccessful, being defeated by the two incumbent councillors.

==Publishing==
Gillon&#x27;s published works include:
* &quot;United to Protect: An Historical Account of the Auckland Fire Brigade, 1848–1985&quot;
* &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke&quot;, an exposé of insurance evasion in relation to The Fire Service
He has also contributed chapters to other works, including:
* &quot;New Zealand Government and Politics&quot;, chapters with Ray Miller on the role of an MP
* &quot;The Baubles of Office: The New Zealand General Election of 2005&quot;, a chapter on The Progressives

==Personal==
Gillon and his family have been long-term residents of the North Shore. Gillon also performs community work and previously a trustee of the Birkenhead Licensing Trust, Northart, Birkenhead-Northcote Glenfield Community Trust and other community organisations.

His daughter, Paula, is also active in Auckland local body politics; having been elected in 2001 to the North Shore City Council two weeks after reaching the required age of eighteen. Paula currently serves on the Kaipatiki Local Board and the Birkenhead Licensing Trust. Grant Gillon&#x27;s eldest son, John, serves as Chair of the Kaipatiki Local Board.

Gillon has a master&#x27;s degree in Public Policy, and a PhD in Public Policy from Massey University. Along with Marilyn Waring, he supervised former minister George Gair&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis at Auckland University of Technology in 2010.

<doc id="1082077" wikidata="Q4437967" url="?curid=1082077" title="Mechanical splice">
<text>A mechanical splice is a junction of two or more optical fibers that are aligned and held in place by a self-contained assembly (usually the size of a large carpenter&#x27;s nail). The fibers are not permanently joined, just precisely held together so that light can pass from one to 
another. This impermanence is an important advantage over fusion splicing, as splice loss, the amount of power that the splice fails to transmit, can be better measured and prevented. 

==Designs and variations==
There are several designs in use for mechanical splicing, varying based on the method of fiber alignment; four common methods, according to the Fiber Optic Association, are the capillary tube, V-groove, elastometric, and rotary splice. 
* A capillary tube splice aligns the optical fibers inside of a glass tube, connecting them with a simple adhesive that matches the refractive index of the fibers. This setup allows for manual adjustments and is often a component in the more complex rotary splice.
* A V-groove plate can accommodate multiple fibers simultaneously, holding the individual fibers in separated grooves on the plate that maintain alignment. This method is popular for its simplicity and long-term effectiveness. 
* An elastometric splice is similar to the V-groove in that it uses lined plates to keep the fibers aligned, but it uses a soft elastomer polymer rather than a harder material like a metal plate. The softer material allows a variety of fibers with different diameters to be used. 
* A rotary splice is a more costly and complex connector which uses rotating glass ferrules to minimize splice loss. This is largely considered unpopular due to the increased amount of labor involved, as maintaining minimal splice loss requires frequent manual adjustment.

Other than the method of alignment, all forms of optical fiber splicing, including non-mechanical fusion splicing, involve an essentially identical process of cleaving and testing. Good cleaving, by creating a flat surface for fibers to be aligned and connected on, reduces splice loss in all forms of optical fiber splicing.

<doc id="1082082" wikidata="Q1109402" url="?curid=1082082" title="Gavin Rae">
<text>Gavin Paul Rae (born 28 November 1977) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He was recently the head coach of National Premier Leagues NSW club Hakoah Sydney City East FC.

Rae started his playing career with Dundee, making over 200 league appearances for the club. He moved to Rangers in January 2004, but struggled to hold down a regular place in their team due to injury. He moved to Cardiff City in 2007 and featured regularly in the team that reached the 2008 FA Cup final. Rae left Cardiff in 2011 and had spells later in his career with Dundee and Aberdeen. He also won 14 caps for Scotland between 2001 and 2009.

==Club career==
===Dundee===
Rae was born in Aberdeen. His first club was Dundee. In total he made 223 games for the club scoring 26 goals in a period of eight years. In November 1999 he memorably scored a last minute winner to beat future club Rangers at Ibrox.

Rae stuck with the club during the bad financial days during the 2003–2004 season when Dundee hit administration until he was sold to Rangers for £250,000 in January 2004.

===Rangers===
Rae made his debut for Rangers on 3 January 2004 against Celtic but only lasted 30 minutes due to a hamstring injury. After recovering, he managed to score his first goal against Dundee, his former club. However, he suffered another injury, damaging his knee against Dundee United on 24 April 2004. His road to recovery was hit by several set-backs before he finally made his return to the Rangers first team on 18 February 2006 against Hibernian. He went on to make regular appearances in the Rangers team, particularly towards the end of the season with fellow midfielder Barry Ferguson requiring an operation due to a long running leg injury.

In the 2006–07 season, Rae was given the captaincy in a number of games when Barry Ferguson was not playing. On 1 January 2007 he was announced as permanent captain after Ferguson&#x27;s meeting with Paul Le Guen, which saw Ferguson stripped of the captaincy and removed from the squad. On 4 January 2007 Le Guen resigned from the managerial position at Rangers and new manager Walter Smith re-appointed Ferguson as club captain. He was offered a new deal at the club by Smith but he decided it would be better for him to attempt to find first team football. Rae left Rangers as a free agent at the end of the 2006–07 season when his contract expired.

On 21 May 2007 he was linked with a move to Hearts with his former teammate at Rangers, Stephen Hughes but the move did not come to fruition.

===Cardiff City===
Rae was watched by several sides from England, Wales and Scotland and came very close to joining Football League Championship side Norwich City but instead on 23 June 2007 he joined Championship side Cardiff City along with fellow Scotsman Steven MacLean on a free transfer. On 26 June 2007 he was quoted in an interview saying &quot;Believe me, I am coming to Cardiff fully fit and fully committed. I am fired up to make the most of this chance&quot;.

On his arrival Rae found himself in first team action from the start of the season due to a long-term injury to Riccardo Scimeca and also took over the captaincy for the 2–1 home win against Burnley with Darren Purse starting the match on the bench, Scimeca injured and Stephen McPhail dropped from the side and he scored his first goal for the Bluebirds not long after on 15 September in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle. He went on to make a total of 55 appearances in all competitions in his first year, more than any other player at the club including playing in all 6 matches during the clubs run to the FA Cup Final.

The following season began badly for Rae when, after making just two appearances, he chipped a bone in his leg just below his knee during a 2–1 win over AFC Bournemouth in the League Cup. Rae was told that he could continue playing with the injury if he could withstand the pain, returning to the side after a month out. He went on to appear in 46 matches in all competitions for Cardiff, the second highest amount behind Roger Johnson.

Rae started the 2009–10 season on the bench but was handed his first appearance of the year after 45 minutes of the opening game with Joe Ledley suffering from an illness. With Ledley away on international duty, he was handed a start in a 3–1 win over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in the first round of the Football League Cup and scored the first goal of the game. He made his 400th club appearance in a 4–3 win over Sheffield United on 24 October 2009, coming on for Stephen McPhail, and made his 100th league appearance for Cardiff on 1 November 2009 against Nottingham Forest as a substitute. During a 4–4 draw with Peterborough United on 28 December 2009, Rae suffered a broken hand keeping him out for up to 4 weeks, but returned on 9 January 2010 against Blackpool after a remarkable recovery. On 9 April 2010, Rae was confirmed to be sidelined for the rest of the season after he suffered a ruptured tendon in his ankle. Having fallen out of favour at the start of the 2010–11 season following the arrivals of Danny Drinkwater and Seyi Olofinjana, Rae was allowed to open talks with Leeds United in August 2010 over a possible transfer. Rae left Cardiff later in the summer.

=== Return to Dundee ===

Aberdeen were interested in signing Rae, but on 14 October 2011, he signed a short-term deal with his former club Dundee. Rae scored against Morton in a 2–1 victory. On 26 November 2011, Rae scored a header against Falkirk as Dundee won 4–2. Rae also scored against Kilmarnock in a fourth round Scottish Cup Replay with Dundee losing out 2–1.

=== Aberdeen ===

On 30 January 2012, Rae signed for his home town club Aberdeen.
 He scored his first goal for the club in the Scottish League Cup against Greenock Morton, and his first league goal for Aberdeen on 23 September 2012 playing against Motherwell. He then went on to score goals against Hibs and Kilmarnock. Rae left Aberdeen at the end of the 2012–13 season, as his contract was not renewed.

=== Third spell at Dundee ===

On 6 June 2013, Rae once again joined Dundee, this time as a player/coach. He scored his first goal in this spell in a 4–1 win against Dumbarton on 12 October 2013. He decided to leave the club after gaining promotion to the Scottish Premiership in May 2014 and subsequently retired.

===Hakoah Sydney City East FC===
In September 2014, Rae moved to Australia and signed with National Premier Leagues NSW club Hakoah Sydney City East FC. 

==Managerial career==
===Hakoah Sydney City East FC===
Rae became Hakoah&#x27;s head coach in January 2018 while still registered as a player. He retired as a player later that year.
=== Rydalmere Lions FC ===

Rae was appointed Rydalmere Lions manager in September 2019. He and his assistant Neil Jablonski left the club in August 2021.

== International career ==

Rae was still at Dundee when he gained international recognition, winning his first cap for Scotland in 2001 against Poland. On 24 March 2008 he received his first call-up to the squad for two years, and also his first while at Cardiff. He came on as a substitute at half-time during a 1–1 draw with Croatia. Rae was once again called up to replace the suspended James McFadden in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Holland on 9 September 2009.

==Other ventures==
Along with Curtis Davies and Chris Burke, Rae co-founded and was a director of the clothing company Seven One Zero, which was voluntarily dissolved in 2018.
