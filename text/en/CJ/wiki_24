<text>An art school is an educational institution with a primary focus on practice and related theory in the visual arts and design. This includes fine art – especially illustration, painting, contemporary art, sculpture, and graphic design. They may be independent or operate within a larger institution, such as a university. Some may be associated with an art museum.

Art schools can offer elementary, secondary, post-secondary, undergraduate or graduate programs, and can also offer a broad-based range of programs (such as the liberal arts and sciences). In the West there have been six major periods of art school curricula, and each one has had its own hand in developing modern institutions worldwide throughout all levels of education. Art schools also teach a variety of non-academic skills to many students.
== History ==
Nicholas Houghton identifies six definitive historical art-school curricula in the Western tradition of art and art education: &quot;apprentice, academic, formalist, expressive, conceptual, and professional&quot;.
Each of these curricula has aided not only the way that modern art-schools teach, but also how students learn about art.

Art schools have been perceived as legitimate universities since the 1980s. Before this, any art programs were used purely as extracurricular activities,
and there were no methods of grading works. After the 1980s, art programs began to be integrated into schools and universities as legitimate courses that could be evaluated. While some argue that this weakened creativity among modern art-students, others see this as a way to treat fine arts as equal to other subjects.

=== Apprentice curriculum ===
Apprentice paths teach art as a mixture of aesthetic and function. In the past, students worked in the studio of an artist in exchange for room and board. Many of the Old Masters received training in this manner, copying or painting in the style of their teacher in order to learn the trade. Once the apprenticeship ended, the student would have to prove what they learned by creating a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Today this is sometimes done in photography or printmaking studios.

=== Academic curriculum ===
Academic curricula began during the sixteenth-century Italian Renaissance, in which some of the earliest art academies were established. Up through the nineteenth century, these academies multiplied through both Europe and North America, and art began to become about both talent and intellect.

=== Formalist curriculum ===

The formalist curriculum began in the mid-twentieth century, and focused on the basic components of artwork, such as &quot;color, shape, texture, line - and a concern with the particular properties of a material or medium&quot;. This curriculum is most noted for including the height in popularity of Bauhaus. It was based on logic, mathematics, and &#x27;Neoplatonism&#x27;, which was widespread at the time.

=== Expressive curriculum ===
Although the expressive curriculum originated at the same time as the formalist one, it focuses on completely different aspects of art. Rather than being concerned with the literal components of a piece of art, expressive curricula encouraged students to express their emotions and practice spontaneity. This is due to the heightened popularity of romanticism throughout the Renaissance.

=== Conceptual curriculum ===
The conceptual curriculum began in the late-twentieth century, and focused not only on creating artwork, but also on presenting and describing the thought process behind the work. This is when the idea of critiquing others&#x27; works for educational purposes became popularized in North America (as the concept had been shut down quickly in Europe). This serves as a model for modern-day art school programs.

=== Professional curriculum ===
Professional curricula began appearing in art schools at the very end of the twentieth century. They teach students artistry from a perspective of business, and typically focus on modern pop-culture within the works themselves. These programs are designed to teach students how to promote both themselves and their artwork.

== Contemporary art schools==
A wide variety of art mediums and styles are integrated into modern art school programs. Different mediums that are taught include painting, printmaking, drawing and illustration, theatre, and sculpture. Newer programs can include graphic design, filmmaking, graffiti art, and certain kinds of digital media.Some art schools include disciplines such as video game design, photography, fashion design, textile design, conceptual art, web design, architectural design and engineering, journalism and social media. Some schools continue craft traditions such as pottery, embroidery, printmaking, metalwork and building crafts.

Many cover theoretical subjects such as cultural anthropology, cultural theory and cultural history including histories of art traditions in local and global cultures, design theory, business and industry studies such as marketing communication, customer profiling and production related technical subjects.

In recent years a number of art schools have begun to offer some or all of their curricula online, which by nature, transcends national boundaries. Among these are The Art Institute of Pittsburgh Online and Academy of Art University. As with on-ground schools, many of the majors involve computer-based work, such as compositions created in Photoshop, Illustrator, or 3D-Studio Max. Submission and review of these materials proceeds virtually identically for on-ground and online classes. When online courses require production of traditional drawings or other such materials, they usually are photographed or scanned for submission and review by instructors.

According to the &quot;International Journal of Art and Design Education&quot;, &quot;mainstream educational contexts could foster drawing behaviour and the related emotional benefits to a greater extent&quot;. A study by Bryan Goodwin that focused on the &quot;Mozart effect&quot;, which refers to the idea that listening to classical music is beneficial for mental and intellectual development, discovered that art education is useful to students of any age. It was discovered that learning both music and art within one&#x27;s education were helpful in processing symptoms for those with PTSD, anxiety, and depression.

== North America ==

=== United States ===

In the U.S., art and design schools that offer Bachelor of Fine Arts or Master of Fine Arts degrees break down into basic types with some overlap and variations.

The most highly rated schools belong to a consortium formed in 1991 and called the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD). These schools differ from for-profit career schools in that they require a strong component of liberal arts courses in addition to art and design courses, providing a well-rounded college degree.

There also are partnerships between art schools and universities such as School of the Art Institute of Chicago with Roosevelt University, the New England School of Art and Design at Suffolk University, Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University, the Rhode Island School of Design with Brown University, Maryland Institute College of Art and Johns Hopkins University, ArtCenter College of Design, the Corcoran College of Art and Design with The George Washington University, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in conjunction with Tufts University, Tyler School of Art at Temple University, Parsons School of Design at The New School, or Herron School of Art at Indiana University.

There are at least two state-supported independent art schools in the U.S., Fashion Institute of Technology, which is part of the state university school system in New York, and Massachusetts College of Art and Design.

Cooper Union in New York City is among the most selective of art schools, admitting 4%, with every student on half scholarship. The Yale School of Art at Yale University offers only graduate classes in its two-year MFA programs. The &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; reported on Thursday, February 1, 2007, that the School had 1215 applications for its class of 2009 and would offer admission to fifty-five students.

Next up the scale in size for an art school would be a large art or design department, school, or college at a university. If it is a college, such as the College of Design at Iowa State University typically, it would contain programs that teach studio art, graphic design, photography, architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, or interior architecture, as well as art, design, and architectural history areas. Sometimes these are simply the schools of art, architecture, and design such as those at the College of Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign or the Yale School of Art. With over 3,000 students, VCU School of the Arts at Virginia Commonwealth University is one of the largest art schools in the nation and is also has achieved the highest ranking ever for a public university. Variation exists among art schools that are larger institutions, however, the essential element is that programs at universities tend to include more liberal arts courses and slightly less studio work, when compared to dedicated, but independent, schools of art.

The most common type of art school is affiliated with a university or college that offers a BA BFA, MA, or MFA. Many of the degree-offering institutions do not offer intense training in classical realism and academic painting and drawing. The Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts is considered a collegiate version of this educational model. This gap is filled by Atelier art schools (schools located inside an artist&#x27;s studio) or in separate locations, such as the New York Academy of Art, the National Academy of Design, the New York Studio School, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA), established 1805, the Art Students League of New York, established in 1875.

=== Canada ===
There are four independent art and design universities in Canada, all public institutions. They are Emily Carr University of Art and Design (Vancouver), NSCAD University (Halifax), OCAD University (Toronto), and Alberta College of Art and Design (Calgary).

Emily Carr University has the most active research program among the four with over $15 million in research over the last five years. OCAD University&#x27;s research intensity has reached $3.2 million in 2011–12. All four schools teach in the major disciplines from painting through to new media and design. Over the last five years, Emily Carr has garnered most of the major awards for students and alums across the country.

NSCAD University was founded in 1887 by Anna Leonowens and other Halifax women. The school gained international prominence in the 1970s for innovation in conceptual art under the leadership of Garry Kennedy. In spite of its modest size, &quot;Art in America&quot; suggested in 1973 that NSCAD was &quot;the best art school in North America&quot;, while more recently &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it Canada&#x27;s &quot;most illustrious&quot;.

The teaching of visual art at Mount Allison University can be traced back to the opening of the Women&#x27;s Academy in 1854. It has been an important part of the curriculum since that time. In 1941, Mount Allison was the first university in Canada to give a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in the visual arts. Much of the department&#x27;s history was, and is, directly related to the Owens Art Gallery. Established in 1895, The Owens is Canada’s oldest university fine arts museum and the custodian of an important collection that span the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Until 1965, when the department moved to its own quarters in the Gairdner Fine Arts Building, the department was housed in the gallery. Since that time the gallery has been extensively remodelled into one of the largest in the Maritimes, serving both the university and community. In 2014, the department moved to a new contemporary state of the art studio facility in the Purdy Crawford Centre for the Arts. And in 2020, the Pierre Lassonde School of Fine Arts was established through philanthropic support, and builds on the program&#x27;s long-standing history in and support of the arts.

==== Secondary schools (Ontario area) ====
Claude Watson School for the Arts and Karen Kain School of the Arts are intermediate-age public art schools in Toronto, Ontario. They are continued by the Claude Watson program at Earl Haig Secondary School and by the Etobicoke School of the Arts, Rosedale Heights School of the Arts, Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts, and the Catholic board Cardinal Carter Academy for the Arts.

In Brampton, Mayfield Secondary School&#x27;s Regional Arts Program offers a public high school-level art school. Mississauga&#x27;s Cawthra Park Secondary School offers the Regional Arts Program within a public high school-level art school as well. St. Roch Catholic Secondary School and St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School have regional arts programs at the Catholic high school level.

Canterbury High School, in Ottawa&#x27;s Urbandale neighbourhood, is an arts magnet school.

== Europe ==

=== Belgium ===
Art schools include the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Ecole Supérieure des Arts du Cirque, and La Cambre.

=== France ===
 The oldest art academy in France is Paris Fine Art School, established in 1648 by Charles Le Brun, and most present public art schools are over two centuries old: Nancy (1708), Toulouse (1726), Rouen (1741), etc. Some of those schools were called academies and were prestigious institutions, devoted to the education of great painters or sculptors. Others were called &quot;école gratuite de dessin&quot; (free school for drawing) and were devoted to the education of arts and craft artists.  

Currently, there are 45 national or territorial public schools of art in France, which deliver bachelor (DNA) and master (DNSEP or DNSAP) degrees. They do not belong to universities.

=== Germany ===
The Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg () was founded in 1662 by Jacob von Sandrart and is the oldest art academy in German-speaking Central Europe. Fine and applied arts have since formed key sectors of learning, although the emphasis has shifted in one direction or the other over the centuries. Today, learning takes the form of interdisciplinary interaction, and dialogue between fine and applied disciplines. It is flanked by new degree courses and a new media technology study program.

=== Greece   ===
Art education in Greece is provided by institutions such as the Athens School of Fine Arts, established in 1837, Thessaloniki School of Fine Arts, Florina School of Fine Arts and Ioannina School of Fine Arts. These schools offer programs in various visual arts disciplines, contributing significantly to the cultural and artistic heritage of the country.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, there are twenty Academies of Fine Arts sustained by the state and eighteen private and public academies legally recognized. The Florence Academy of Fine Arts in Florence is the oldest Academy of Fine Arts in the world. All these academies, together with all the music conservatories, institutes of musical studies, and other educational institutes, converge in a specific compartment of the Italian Ministry of University and Research named AFAM (Alta Formazione Artistica, Musicale e Coreutica).

=== The Netherlands ===
Royal Academy of Art, The Hague was founded in 1682 and is the largest and oldest art institution in the Netherlands. Design Academy Eindhoven was founded in 1955. Gerrit Rietveld Academie was founded in 1924 in Amsterdam with a main focus on De Stijl and Bauhaus at that time.

=== Sweden ===
Art schools have existed in Sweden since the first half of the 18th century. Students may attend the Royal Institute of Art, founded in 1735. Established in 1844 originally as a part-time art school for Sunday artisans, the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design known as &quot;Konstfack&quot; is an arts college offering bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in ceramics, glass, textiles, metalworking, and more.  

There are also tertiary art schools attached to universities in Gothenburg, Malmö, and Umeå.

=== United Kingdom ===
Art education in the United Kingdom includes institutions like the Royal College of Art, which was established in 1837, and other prestigious schools such as the Slade School of Fine Art and the Glasgow School of Art. These institutions offer comprehensive programs in various art disciplines.

Perhaps those most applicable to the definition of &#x27;art school&#x27; are the autonomous colleges or schools of art offering courses across both further and higher education boundaries, of which there are approximately eighteen, under the banner of United Kingdom Art &amp; Design Institutions Association. Others, whose existence ties in indelibly with that of larger, non-discipline-specific universities (such as the Slade School of Art) exist. Most art schools of either orientation are equipped to offer opportunities spanning from post-16 to postgraduate level.

The range of colleges span from further education establishments to research-led specialist institutes. The University of the Arts London, for example, is a federally structured institution that comprises six previously independent schools situated in London. These include Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion, and Wimbledon College of Arts; others include The Slade School of Fine Art, Ravensbourne University London, The Royal College of Art and Goldsmiths College, University of London, which each grant undergraduate and postgraduate awards under one collegiate arm. The Royal College of Art with its degree-awarding arm and singular focus on postgraduate awards being a most singular exception.

Outside of London art schools in the UK include Arts University Bournemouth, Coventry School of Art and Design, University for the Creative Arts, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design, Edinburgh College of Art (part of University of Edinburgh), Glasgow School of Art, Gray&#x27;s School of Art, Hereford College of Arts, Leeds College of Art, Liverpool School of Art (part of Liverpool John Moores University), Loughborough University School of Art and Design, Manchester School of Art (part of Manchester Metropolitan University), Norwich University of the Arts, Moray School of Art (University of the Highlands and Islands), The Northern School of Art and Plymouth College of Art and Design.

Since the 1970s, degrees have replaced diplomas as the top-tier qualification in the field.

In the case of wholly freestanding institutions, degree validation agreements in liaison with a university have long been the custom for Bachelor of Arts (Hons) level upward. There has been a general trend for all-encompassing universities to offer programs in the visual arts, and formerly independent art schools have merged with polytechnics and universities to offer such degrees. A notable exception to this is the City and Guilds of London Art School, an independent art school solely focused on fine art and related disciplines such as carving and conservation. A few art schools have taken on university status themselves, namely Arts University Bournemouth, University for the Creative Arts, University of the Arts London, and Norwich University of the Arts. While Courtauld Institute of Art, Leeds College of Art and Royal College of Art are recognised institutions - some with degree awarding powers.

Most specialist institutions in the United Kingdom can trace their histories back to the nineteenth century or beyond, originating usually from government initiatives.

== Oceania ==

=== Indonesia ===
The first art school in Indonesia was the Universitaire Leergang voor Tekenleraren en Handenarbeit located in Bandung, part of Technical Faculty of Universiteit van Indonesie (Indonesian: &quot;Fakultas Teknik Universitas Indonesia&quot;). The school was initiated by Simon Admiraal (Art Teacher from Jakarta Lyceum), and Ries Mulder (Hollands Artist) in the year 1947. Now, the school is integrated to Institut Teknologi Bandung as Faculty of Art and Design, in the same location as previous school. Following the establishment of Universitaire Leergang, in 1950 ASRI (Indonesian Visual Art Academy) was opened in Jogjakarta, now ISI Jogjakarta. Currently there is a prominent Art School in every major Islands in Indonesia, following the establishment of ISI (Indonesian Art Institute) and ISBI (Indonesian Art and Culture Institute) in every major Islands/cities, like ISI Surakarta, ISI Denpasar, ISBI Aceh, ISBI Papua, ISBI Kalimantan, and ISBI Bandung. There are also prominent private art school/program in Indonesia namely Institut Kesenian Jakarta (Jakarta Arts Institute), visual arts program at Telkom University in Bandung, and also at Maranatha University.

=== Australia ===
Art schools in Australia are mostly located within Australian universities as a result of the Dawkins higher education reforms of the late 1980s. Prior to the Dawkins reforms, there was a mix of university-based art schools and single-discipline colleges of art. Art schools are now represented by the peak body, the Australian Council of University Art and Design Schools (ACUADS), which was founded in 1981 and was originally called the National Council of Heads of Art and Design Schools. ACUADS has 30 members:

There are other art schools in Australia, such as the Julian Ashton Art School, but they are either not accredited by TEQSA to award degrees or are private, for-profit institutions that sit outside the university system.

<doc id="1087766" wikidata="Q72601" url="?curid=1087766" title="Brant Bjork">
<text>Brant Bjork (born March 19, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as the drummer and founder of the influential Californian stoner rock band Kyuss. Bjork has also been a member of Fu Manchu, Mondo Generator and Vista Chino, the latter with former Kyuss members John Garcia and Nick Oliveri. He is currently the frontman and co-founder of the stoner rock power trio, Stöner. Bjork is one of the more notable figures in the stoner rock and Palm Desert scene and maintains a prolific solo career with over a dozen released albums.

== Musical career ==

=== Kyuss ===

While still in high school, Bjork got together with friends Chris Cockrell, Nick Oliveri, Josh Homme and John Garcia in 1987 to form a band called Katzenjammer. At Bjork&#x27;s prompting, the band would soon be renamed Sons of Kyuss for a single EP, named after &quot;The Sons of Kyuss&quot; monsters in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, and then later shortened to Kyuss. The band relocated to Los Angeles in 1990 and signed to Chameleon Records, releasing their debut album, &quot;Wretch&quot; in September 1991. They were then picked up by the major label Elektra Records, becoming the first desert rock band to achieve international success. Bjork was a major creative force in Kyuss, contributing a substantial portion of the band&#x27;s songwriting, including standout tracks like &quot;Green Machine&quot; and &quot;50 Million Year Trip (Downside Up)&quot;. In 1994, Bjork left the band following the release of &quot;Welcome to Sky Valley&quot;, frustrated at guitarist Homme&#x27;s growing reluctance to play the songs he was contributing to the band.

=== Post-Kyuss ===
After leaving Kyuss, Bjork would go on to play with several different bands, as well as founding the independent label El Camino Records (later Duna Records). Through his label, Bjork would release albums that he was musically involved in, such as hardcore punk band De-Con&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Balls for Days&quot;, on which he played drums. Bjork would also release and produce stoner rock band Solarfeast&#x27;s 1995 debut &quot;Gossamer&quot;. Bjork would later go on to join former Kyuss bandmate, Josh Homme, in his Palm Desert musical collective series, The Desert Sessions. He would play a mixture of guitar, bass, drums, and percussion on various tracks on the 1997 releases &quot;Volume 1: Instrumental Driving Music For Felons&quot; and &quot;Volume 2: Status: Ships Commander Butchered&quot;, as well as 1999&#x27;s &quot;Volume 5: Poetry for the Masses (SeaShedShitheadByTheSheSore)&quot; and &quot;Volume 6: Black Anvil Ego&quot;.

Bjork briefly moved to Santa Cruz to play guitar for hardcore punk band LAB in 1997 (made up of the remaining members of &#x27;80s punk band BL&#x27;AST!), playing on their 1997 release, the 7-inch EP &quot;Burning Leaf/Chihuahua&quot;. He would also play guitar for Fatso Jetson during 1997–1998, including on their 1998 &quot;Jailbreak&quot; 7-inch split EP with stoner rock band Fu Manchu.

Bjork was playing with another former member of Kyuss, Nick Oliveri, in Oliveri&#x27;s metal band Mondo Generator. Joining in 1997, Bjork&#x27;s drumming would feature on the 2000 LP &quot;Cocaine Rodeo&quot;, and the 2003 LP &quot;A Drug Problem That Never Existed&quot;. He would tour with the band until leaving in 2004. Bjork also appeared on the live video album &quot;Use Once and Destroy Me&quot; released in 2004, as well as later releases recorded during his stint lineup, including the 2006 7-inch single &quot;I Never Sleep&quot; and the 2008 &quot;Australian Tour EP&quot;.

=== Fu Manchu ===

Having produced their debut album &quot;No One Rides for Free&quot; in 1994, Bjork would officially join Fu Manchu with the release of their critically acclaimed 1997 album &quot;The Action Is Go&quot;. Bjork would continue to play on every Fu Manchu recording until his departure following the release of 2001&#x27;s &quot;California Crossing&quot;, including the albums &quot;Eatin&#x27; Dust&quot; and &quot;King of the Road&quot;.

=== Solo career ===
Bjork recorded his first solo album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Jalamanta&quot;, in February of that year and performed all of the album&#x27;s instruments, including guitar and vocals. He would also perform guitar and vocals in the short-lived stoner rock band Ché – a side-project collaboration with former Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age drummer Alfredo Hernández and former Unida bassist Dave Dinsmore. Ché released their only album, &quot;Sounds of Liberation&quot;, in October 2000. Bjork&#x27;s next album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Brant Bjork &amp; the Operators&quot;, named for Bjork&#x27;s fictional backing band, &#x27;the Operators&#x27;, was recorded in November 2000 with Bjork again performing vocals and most instruments. He would continue to be the sole performer, except for a few guest spots, on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Keep Your Cool&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Local Angel&quot;.

Bjork would form the band Brant Bjork and the Bros in 2003, featuring guitarist Mike Pygmie, bassist Dylan Roche, and drummer Michael Peffer, with Bjork performing vocals and additional guitar. They toured Europe in October 2003, performing a mixture of Bjork&#x27;s solo material and Ché&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of Liberation&quot;. Pygmie was replaced by Scott &quot;Cortez&quot; Silverman for further touring in Europe and North America in 2004. This line-up went on to record the 2005 double album &quot;Saved by Magic&quot;. The album featured a return to the sound of Bjork&#x27;s earlier sound from his &quot;Jalamanta&quot;/&quot;Sounds of Liberation&quot; era.

2006 saw the release of &quot;Sabbia&quot;, a feature film &quot;visual soundtrack&quot; by filmmaker Kate McCabe, featuring Bjork&#x27;s music. Brant Bjork and the Bros would go on to record another album, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Somera Sól&quot;, with Alfredo Hernández replacing Michael Peffer on drums. In the same year, Bjork released his fifth solo album, &quot;Tres Dias&quot;, an acoustic album featuring reinterpretations of older songs, as well as some new material. The title of the album (&quot;Three Days&quot;) comes from the purported amount of time that Bjork claimed it took to record it at producer Tony Mason&#x27;s house in Joshua Tree, California.

Bjork reported in 2007 that he had ended his label, Duna Records, citing that it took too much time and energy to run. Bjork soon created a new label, Low Desert Punk Recordings, and the Duna Records website now functions as a Brant Bjork community fansite and forum. The first release on the new label was Bjork&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Punk Rock Guilt&quot;, made up of recordings from December 2005 referred to as the &quot;New Jersey Sessions&quot;. This release was followed up with the 2010 album &quot;Gods &amp; Goddesses&quot;. Recorded in LA in 2009, &quot;Gods &amp; Goddesses&quot; was the first Brant Bjork solo album not to be primarily recorded by Bjork himself. Instead, Bjork recorded with a new line-up of musicians including guitarist Brandon Henderson, former Yawning Man bassist Billy Cordell, and former Mondo Generator drummer Giampaolo Farnedi.

In March 2014, Bjork announced that he would tour Australia in May with his backing band, the &#x27;Low Desert Punks&#x27;, consisting of bassist Dave Dinsmore, guitarist Bubba Dupree, and Tony Tornay on drums. He would later announce a New Zealand tour with dates in June. In November, an album, &quot;Black Power Flower&quot; was released on Napalm Records under the name Brant Bjork and the Low Desert Punk Band.

In June 2018, Bjork announced his new album, &quot;Mankind Woman&quot;. The album released on September 14, 2018, on Heavy Psych Sounds. Mankind Woman was noted for its &quot;smoother and more laid back&quot; style and psychedelic influences, compared to Bjork&#x27;s previous work. The album was produced by Bubba Dupree, also serving as guitarist throughout. Another notable feature was the shared lead vocals between Bjork and long-time friend Sean Wheeler, who also performed as special guest on the subsequent Mankind Woman album tour in North America and Europe. Brant Bjork handpicked Danish The Sonic Dawn as his European tour support, echoing the psychedelic touches of &quot;Mankind Woman&quot;.

In April 2019, a new solo record entitled &quot;Jacoozzi&quot; was released. Originally recorded in 2010 and then shelved, &quot;Jacoozzi&quot; is an instrumental album, featuring jazz and funk influences with break beats. Bjork explains the material was improvisation meant to lead up to a new solo record. But Vista Chino started up around that time and thus the album was shelved. It was released on April 5, 2019, on Heavy Psych Sounds.

In May 2019, a &#x27;remixed and remastered&#x27; reissue of &quot;Jalamanta&quot; was announced, set for release on September 13, 2019, on Heavy Psych Sounds, 20 years after the album&#x27;s initial release. The remix was done by Tony Mason, who also did the original mix, and the remastering was done by John McBain at JPM Mastering, San Francisco.

In May 2020, Bjork released his eponymous studio album, &quot;Brant Bjork&quot;, on Heavy Psych Sounds.

In October 2022, Bjork released his sixteenth solo album, &quot;Bougainvillea Suite&quot;, on Heavy Psych Sounds. Bjork has described the album as &quot;bittersweet&quot; since it is his last record to be recorded in his studio in Joshua Tree. The album features contributions from his Stöner bandmates.

In 2023, Bjork announced a tour with his new backing band, the Brant Bjork Trio. The lineup includes bassist Mario Lalli of Fatso Jetson and Stöner drummer Ryan Güt.

=== Vista Chino ===

In November 2010, it was announced that Bjork was forming Kyuss Lives! with Bruno Fevery on guitar, Nick Oliveri on bass and John Garcia on vocals. The band undertook a European, Australian and New Zealand tour from March to May 2011. In November 2012, Kyuss Lives! announced that they had changed their name to Vista Chino.

Vista Chino released their debut album &quot;Peace&quot; on September 3, 2013, through Napalm Records.

He played with the band until October 2014, at which point Nick Oliveri announced there was a falling out and that Bjork and Garcia would continue working on their solo projects.

=== Stöner ===

In early 2020, Bjork formed the stoner rock power trio, Stöner, alongside Oliveri and Ryan Güt, the drummer for Bjork&#x27;s solo band. In October, the trio made their live debut performing on the fourth volume of the concert series &quot;Live in the Mojave Desert&quot;. The album was released on April 30. In June 2021, the band released their debut album, &quot;Stoners Rule&quot;. Stöner released their sophomore album, &quot;Totally...&quot;, in May 2022. In February 2023, the band released their debut EP, &quot;Boogie to Baja&quot;.

<doc id="1087773" wikidata="Q7773368" url="?curid=1087773" title="The Walrus">
<text>The Walrus is an independent, nonprofit Canadian media organization. It is multi-platform and produces an eight-issue-per-year magazine and online editorial content that includes current affairs, fiction, poetry, and podcasts, a national speaker series called The Walrus Talks, and branded content for clients through The Walrus Lab.

==History==

=== Creation ===
In 2002, David Berlin, a former editor and owner of the &quot;Literary Review of Canada&quot;, began promoting his vision of a world-class Canadian magazine. This led him to meet with then-&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; editor Lewis H. Lapham to discuss creating a &quot;&quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; North&quot;, which would combine the American magazine with 40 pages of Canadian content. As Berlin searched for funding to create that content, a mutual friend put him in touch with Ken Alexander, a former high school English and history teacher and then senior producer of CBC Newsworld&#x27;s &quot;CounterSpin&quot;. Like Berlin, Alexander was hoping to found an intelligent Canadian magazine that dealt with world affairs.

Before long, the Chawkers Foundation, run by Alexander&#x27;s family, agreed to give the prospective magazine $5 million over five years, and the George Cedric Metcalf Charitable Foundation promised $150,000 for an internship program. This provided enough money to get by without the partnership with &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, Berlin and Alexander hired creative director Antonio de Luca and art director Jason Logan to envision the launch of &quot;The Walrus&quot;.

The magazine launched in September 2003 as an attempt to create a Canadian equivalent to U.S. magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, or &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Since then, it has become Canada&#x27;s leading general-interest magazine. Its mandate is:

to be a national general interest magazine about Canada and its place in the world. We are committed to publishing the best work by the best writers from Canada and elsewhere on a wide range of topics for readers who are curious about the world.
=== Name ===
The &quot;walrus&quot; name was at first a working title, but quickly grew on the magazine&#x27;s staff. According to its website, the rationale for it was &quot;to dissociate this country with the &#x27;log chomping&#x27; and &#x27;earnestness&#x27; of our national animal (and cliché), the beaver&quot;; the walrus, just as native to Canada, is &quot;curmudgeonly but clever, bulky but agile (if only in water).&quot; Most importantly, in David Berlin&#x27;s words, &quot;No one ignores a walrus.&quot;

=== Magazine ===
Berlin resigned as editor in 2004, and Alexander ended his tumultuous reign as publisher, then editor, in 2008. John Macfarlane, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Toronto Life&quot; and publisher of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, joined &quot;The Walrus&quot; in 2008 as editor and co-publisher. With newly returned art director Brian Morgan, Macfarlane oversaw a revamping of the editorial and art direction of the magazine. The new &quot;Walrus&quot; was to be more consistent and current, with a &quot;far more internally driven&quot; process for story selection, and the reworked cover featuring illustrations that corresponded to each issue&#x27;s content.

&quot;The Walrus&quot; soon began to receive critical acclaim: its two 2003 issues alone garnered 11 National Magazine Award nominations and three wins, and the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; awarded it the prize for best new publication in 2004. In 2006, it won the National Magazine Award for Magazine of the Year in Canada. As of 2017, it has consistently led in the National Magazine Awards, with 70 wins and 231 nominations.

In 2012, High Fidelity HDTV and &quot;The Walrus&quot; announced plans to air 14 &quot;original high-definition documentaries&quot; derived from content from &quot;The Walrus&quot; that had been produced since April 2011. The two companies planned to create more documentaries in the future.

On 13 September 2012, the Walrus unveiled its redesigned website. It was based on the Wordpress platform and developed over five months.

=== Unpaid internship programme ===
In 2014, &quot;The Walrus&quot; was required to shut down its unpaid internship programme after the Ontario Ministry of Labour declared that its longstanding practice of not paying interns contravened the Employment Standards Act. The magazine issued a statement justifying its practice of using unpaid labour, saying:

We have been training future leaders in media and development for ten years, and we are extremely sorry we are no longer able to provide these opportunities, which have assisted many young Ontarians—and Canadians—in bridging the gap from university to paid work and in, many cases, on to stellar careers.

In 2014, The Walrus began offering paid six-month editorial fellowships. In 2020, the fellowships grew to one year.

=== December 2014–present ===
On 1 December 2014, Jonathan Kay replaced Macfarlane as editor-in-chief.

In October 2015, a report in &quot;Canadaland&quot; detailed a toxic and disorganised environment at the magazine.

Kay resigned on 14 May 2017 following a controversy about cultural appropriation in which he dismissed Indigenous concerns about the practice. Jessica Johnson was named executive editor, in addition to her existing role as creative director, on 7 September 2017.

Johnson resigned on 2 February 2023, saying, &quot;five years is a long time in the life of a magazine editor, and I&#x27;ve had a really good run.&quot; Carmine Starnino, editor-at-large at &quot;The Walrus&quot; and a founding editor of &quot;Maisonneuve&quot; magazine, stepped up as interim editor-in-chief no later than 21 February.

==Finances==
Though &quot;The Walrus&quot; was initially pledged $1 million annually by the Chawkers Foundation for its first five years, it was unable to access this money without first being recognized as a charitable organisation by the Canada Revenue Agency. The Alexander family was forced to support the magazine out of its own pocket until it finally received charitable status in 2005, creating the charitable nonprofit Walrus Foundation. In addition to publishing the magazine, the Foundation runs events across Canada, including talks and debates on public policy.

In the relatively small yet geographically large Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, which &quot;The Walrus&quot; editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reported in 2011, &quot;The Walrus&quot;&#x27;s charitable model, similar to that of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, was thus far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. This is especially important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.

<text>The Serb Volunteer Guard was an elite Serbian volunteer paramilitary unit founded and led by Željko Ražnatović (better known as &quot;Arkan&quot;). It was recognized for its superior bearing and discipline, fighting in the Croatian War and the Bosnian War during the Yugoslav Wars. Considered one of the most feared and effective paramilitary forces during the wars, the unit was supposedly, also responsible for numerous war crimes and massacres.

==History and organization==


The SDG was created on 11 October 1990 by twenty members of the Red Star Belgrade football club Ultra group Delije Sever. The group was under the command of the Territorial Defense, a regular military in charge of the territories of Croatia populated predominantly by Serbs during the first half of the 1990s. According to historian Tony Judt, the group was one of several irregular units which &quot;were little more than organized bands of thugs and criminals, armed by Belgrade.&quot;

The SDG set up their headquarters and training camp in a former military facility in Erdut. It saw action from mid-1991 to late 1995, initially in the Vukovar region of Croatia. It was supplied and equipped from the reserves of the Serbian police force during the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia and Croatia.

After the war broke out in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in the autumn of 1991 and in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 1992, Arkan and his units moved to attack different territories in these countries. In Croatia, Arkan&#x27;s Tigers fought in various locales in Eastern Slavonia.

The SDG, under the command of Arkan, massacred hundreds of people in eastern Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina while in the early ethnic cleansing campaigns in eastern Bosnia this unit had a major role. In autumn 1995, Arkan&#x27;s troops fought in the area of Banja Luka, Sanski Most, and Prijedor where they were routed. Arkan personally led most war actions, and rewarded his most efficient officers and soldiers with ranks, medals and eventually the products of lootings. 

The SDG was officially disbanded in April 1996, and all of its members were ordered to join the Yugoslav Army. Besides Arkan, a notable member of the SDG was his right-hand man, Colonel Nebojša Djordjević, who was murdered in late 1996. Another notable member was Milorad Ulemek, who is now serving a 40-year sentence for his involvement in the assassination of Serbia&#x27;s pro-Western prime minister Zoran Đinđić in 2003.

==War crimes charges==
Željko Ražnatović was indicted in 1997 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for his command of the Guard, as the unit was allegedly responsible for numerous crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Convention and violations of the laws or customs of war, including active participation in the ethnic cleansing in Bijeljina and Zvornik in 1992.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia charged the SDG, under the command or supervision of Željko Ražnatović with the following:
*Forcibly detaining approximately thirty non-Serb men and one woman, without food or water, in an inadequately ventilated boiler room of approximately in size.
*Transporting twelve non-Serb men from Sanski Most to an isolated location in the village of Trnova, where they shot and killed eleven of the men and critically wounded the twelfth.
*Transporting approximately sixty-seven non-Serb men and one woman from Sanski Most, Šehovci, and Pobrijeze to an isolated location in the village of Sasina and shooting them, killing sixty-five of the captives and wounding two survivors.
*Forcibly detaining approximately thirty-five Muslim Bosnian men in an inadequately ventilated boiler room around , beating them while also depriving them of food and water, resulting in the deaths of two men.
*The rape of a Muslim Bosnian woman on a bus outside the Hotel Sanus in Sanski Most.

==Prominent members==

*Željko Ražnatović – SDG Commander
*Borislav Pelević – Serbian presidential candidate in 2002 and 2004
*Milorad Ulemek – JSO Commander
*Zvezdan Jovanović – JSO Commander
*Mihajlo Ulemek – SDG Colonel and media personality
*Srđan Golubović - Trance DJ (not to be mistaken with a film director of the same name)
Many of the former members of &quot;Arkan Tigers&quot; are prominent figures in Serbia, maintaining close ties between each other and with Russian nationalist organisations. Jugoslav Simić and Svetozar Pejović posed with Russian Night Wolves, Ceca (Arkan&#x27;s widow) performed for Vladimir Putin during his visit in Serbia, Srđan Golubović is a popular trance performer known as &quot;DJ Max&quot; and was identified by Rolling Stone as the SDG soldier kicking dead bodies of a Bosniak family in Bijeljina on a photo from 1992.

==In popular culture==
* in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines (loosely based on the story of pilot Scott O&#x27;Grady during the Bosnian War), the unit appears as the main antagonists, led by the fictional Miroslav Lokar.
* In the 2008 Serbian film &quot;The Tour&quot;, a group of Serbian actors go on a tour in war-torn Bosnia. Among other factions, they meet an unnamed paramilitary unit wearing insignia similar to those of the Serb Volunteer Guard. The unit&#x27;s commander (played by Sergej Trifunović) is clearly based on Arkan.
* In the 2012 Japanese anime &quot;Jormungand&quot;, one of the antagonists is Dragan Nikolaevich, commander of the Balkan Dragons. His looks and even his biography bear resounding resemblance to those of Arkan.
* The 2012 film &quot;Twice Born&quot; is based on a novel by Margaret Mazzantini set in the background of Bosnian War.
* In fourteenth episode of the first season of the crime procedural &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Homo Homini Lupis&quot;, the suspect of the investigation is accused of raping a young girl. In the course of the detectives&#x27; interrogation, they identify the suspect as a former member of the volunteer guard due to a tiger tattoo on his back and attempt to establish a pattern of behavior by pointing to the war crimes that occurred in Bosnia.

<text>In music theory, the term period refers to forms of repetition and contrast between adjacent small-scale formal structures such as phrases. In twentieth-century music scholarship, the term is usually used similarly to the definition in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Music&quot;: &quot;a period consists of two phrases, antecedent and consequent, each of which begins with the same basic motif.&quot; Earlier and later usages vary somewhat, but usually refer to notions of symmetry, difference, and an open section followed by a closure. The concept of a musical period originates in comparisons between music structure and rhetoric at least as early as the 16th century.

==Western art music==
In Western art music or Classical music, a period is a group of phrases consisting usually of at least one antecedent phrase and one consequent phrase totaling about 8 bars in length (though this varies depending on meter and tempo). Generally, the antecedent ends in a weaker and the consequent in a stronger cadence; often, the antecedent ends in a half cadence while the consequent ends in an authentic cadence. Frequently, the consequent strongly parallels the antecedent, even sharing most of the material save the final bars. In other cases, the consequent may differ greatly (for example, the period in the beginning of the second movement of the &quot;Pathetique Sonata&quot;).

The 1958 &quot;Encyclopédie Fasquelle&quot; defines a &quot;period&quot; as follows:
*&quot;A complex phrase, in which the various parts are enchained.&quot;
Another definition is as follows:
*&quot;In traditional music...a group of bars comprising a natural division of the melody; usually regarded as comprising two or more contrasting or complementary phrases and ending with a cadence.&quot; (&quot;Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot;, 1969)
And
*&quot;A period is a structure of two consecutive phrases, often built of similar or parallel melodic material, in which the first phrase gives the impression of asking a question which is answered by the second phrase.&quot;
More recent definitions, especially by American theorists, have tightened the use of the term to restrict the contrast so that the first phrase must end in a half cadence or imperfect authentic cadence and the second a perfect authentic cadence.

A double period is, &quot;a group of at least four phrases...in which the first two phrases form the antecedent and the third and fourth phrases together form the consequent.&quot;

When analyzing Classical music, contemporary music theorists usually employ a more specific formal definition, such as the following by William Caplin:
*&quot;the period is normatively an eight-bar structure divided into two four-bar phrases. [...] the antecedent phrase of a period begins with a two-bar basic idea. [...] bars 3–4 of the antecedent phrase bring a &#x27;contrasting idea&#x27; that leads to a weak cadence of some kind. [...] The consequent phrase of the period repeats the antecedent but concludes with a stronger cadence. More specifically, the basic idea &#x27;returns&#x27; in bars 5–6 and then leads to a contrasting idea, which may or may not be based on that of the antecedent.&quot;

==Sub-Saharan music and music of the African diaspora==

===Bell patterns===

The second definition of period in the &quot;New Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; states: &quot;A musical element that is in some way repeated,&quot; applying &quot;to the units of any parameter of music that embody repetitions at any level.&quot; In some sub-Saharan music and music of the African diaspora, the bell pattern embodies this definition of period. The bell pattern (also known as a &quot;key pattern&quot;, &quot;guide pattern&quot;, &quot;phrasing referent&quot;, &quot;timeline&quot;, or &quot;asymmetrical timeline&quot;) is repeated throughout the entire piece, and is one of the principal units of musical time for the ensemble, underlying the rhythms of accompaniment parts as well as melodies and improvisations. The period is usually two or four main beats in length. (See &quot;tresillo&quot; and &quot;cinquillo&quot; for examples of two-beat periods.) Four-beat periods may be represented in Western notation as a single bar, as in the examples given here; but see &quot;Clave&quot; below for an alternate presentation.

The seven-stroke &quot;standard bell pattern&quot; is one of the most commonly used musical periods in sub-Saharan music. The first three strokes of the bell are antecedent, and the remaining four strokes are consequent. The consequent diametrically opposes the antecedent.

===Clave===
Cuban &quot;clave&quot; is a well-known example of an African-derived periodic pattern in the New world. Cuban musicologist Emilio Grenet represents this rhythmic pattern as two bars of 2/4. However, in contemporary Latin music and in Latin jazz, it is usually written with two bars of 4/4, all of the note values doubled.

In explaining the structure of music guided by the five-stroke African bell pattern known in Cuba as &quot;clave&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;key&#x27; or &#x27;code&#x27;), Grenet uses what could be considered a definition of period: &quot;We find that all its melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two bars, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak.&quot;

As Grenet and many others describe the period, the cross-rhythmic antecedent (&#x27;tresillo&#x27;) is strong and the on-beat resolution is weak. This is the opposite of Western harmonic theory, where resolution is described as strong. Despite this difference, both the harmonic and rhythmic periods have consequent resolution. In simplest terms, that resolution occurs harmonically when the tonic is sounded, and in clave-based rhythm when the last main beat is sounded. Metric consonance is achieved when the last stroke of clave coincides with the last main beat (last quarter note) of the consequent bar.

The antecedent bar has three strokes and is called the &quot;three-side&quot; of clave. The consequent bar has two strokes and is called the &quot;two-side&quot;. The three-side gives the impression of asking a question, which is answered by the two-side. The two sides of clave cycle in a type of repeating call and response.

[With] clave . . . the two bars are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series . . . the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave . . . Should the drums fall out of clave (and in contemporary practice they sometimes do) the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken—Amira and Cornelius (1992).

Note that in most Cuban and Cuban-based popular music, such as &quot;salsa&quot;, the two halves of the pattern are reversed: the two-side is the precedent, the three-side the consequent. Please see the article on &quot;clave&quot; for a fuller explanation.

An actual key pattern does not need to be played in order for a key pattern to define the period. The concept and feel are so basic to the musical style that both musicians and listeners sense them even when not actually sounded. This should seem no more mysterious than Western audiences sensing a major scale without the musicians needing to play in note by note.

<text>Altaria is a Finnish heavy metal band from Jakobstad, who have released four albums on the record label Metal Heaven, a fifth on Escape Music and a sixth on Reaper Entertainment.

== History ==
In January 2008, the band decided to part ways with their record label Metal Heaven for undisclosed reasons. In the same month, bass player Marko Pukkila parted ways with the band after an argument concerning the split with Metal Heaven, and was replaced as vocalist by Ex-Terrorwheel bass player, Marco Luponero. After that, the only original member still active with Altaria at the time was Tony Smedjebacka.

Towards the later part of 2008 the band announced on their website that they were in the process of writing songs for their fifth (fourth full) studio album. In March 2009, they stated that they had finished recording 12 tracks for their upcoming release. The title had yet to be confirmed, but one track had already been completed, entitled &quot;Pride and Desire&quot;. Altaria&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Unholy&quot;, was released in May 2009.

After nearly five years of inactivity, the band, together with former bass player Marko Pukkila got together for Altaria&#x27;s final concert at Nummirock 2016 on 23 June.

In December 2019, the band announced through their new website that the 2006 lineup had returned, and were recording material for a sixth album for a late 2020 release. They also remastered their second album,&quot; Divinity&quot;, which was released on 27 March 2020. In April 2022, the band announced their new album, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, would be released on 8 July.

<doc id="1087790" wikidata="Q5058142" url="?curid=1087790" title="Cell (music)">
<text>The 1957 &quot;Encyclopédie Larousse&quot; defines a cell in music as a &quot;small rhythmic and melodic design that can be isolated, or can make up one part of a thematic context&quot;. The cell may be distinguished from the figure or motif:
the 1958 &quot;Encyclopédie Fasquelle&quot; defines a cell as &quot;the smallest indivisible unit&quot;, unlike the motif, which may be divisible into more than one cell. &quot;A cell can be developed, independent of its context, as a melodic fragment, it can be used as a developmental motif. It can be the source for the whole structure of the work; in that case it is called a generative cell.&quot;
A rhythmic cell is a cell without melodic connotations. It may be entirely percussive or applied to different melodic segments.

==History==
The term &quot;cell&quot; (German: &quot;Keim&quot;) derives from organic music theorists of the nineteenth century. Arnold Schering adopted the term, along with &quot;melodic kernels&quot; (&quot;Melodiekerne&quot;) in his analysis of 14th-century madrigal, one of the first uses of Gestalt psychology in music theory.

<doc id="1087791" wikidata="Q2037213" url="?curid=1087791" title="Oamaru stone">
<text>Oamaru stone, sometimes called whitestone, is a hard, compact limestone, quarried at Weston, near Oamaru in Otago, New Zealand.

Oamaru stone was used on many of the grand public buildings in the towns and cities of the southern South Island, especially after the financial boom caused by the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. Initially used primarily in Oamaru itself, it became popular in Dunedin in around 1866, with the University of Otago&#x27;s Registry Building being the first major structure in the city to make use of it.

The city of Dunedin and town of Oamaru both have many fine examples of Oamaru stone edifices, such as St Patrick&#x27;s Basilica. The stone was used widely on buildings in many parts of New Zealand, including in the construction of both the Town Hall and the Chief Post Office in Auckland.

The stone has been prominently used in combination with the more hard-wearing bluestone basalt found in many parts of the southern South Island, creating a distinctive style of dark grey basalt walls with lighter Oamaru stone facings. Notable buildings to use this combination include the Dunedin Railway Station, Otago University Registry Building, Dunedin Law Courts, and Christchurch Arts Centre. In Oamaru itself the stone is most commonly found as the primary construction material, with many of the town&#x27;s more notable buildings (such as the Waitaki District Council building) showing its distinctive creamy colour.

Its ease of working also appeals to sculptors and examples of Oamaru stone sculpture can be found throughout New Zealand.

==Chemistry==
The source of the stone is a 40-metre thick deposit inland from Oamaru consisting of bryozoan limestone. Oamaru stone is limestone with a uniform granular creamy white consistency and colour. Predominantly (90%) calcium carbonate, trace chemicals within it include alumina (1.5%), iron oxide (0.5%) and silica (0.5%). Its chemistry makes it similar to the Ketton stone oolite of southern England and France&#x27;s Caen stone, though it is considerably lighter in weight at 1.68 tonnes per cubic metre when freshly quarried, and 1.47 tonnes per cubic metre when completely dry.

The stone is porous, making it susceptible to weathering in damp conditions, but sturdy in a moderate to dry climate. It is soft when first quarried, hardening on exposure to air. This, along with its uniform texture, makes it excellent for sculptural and ornamental purposes. The finished stonework has a creamy, sandy colour. It is not strongly resistant to pollution, and can be prone to surface crumbling, but is excellent as a material for internal architectural ornamentation. It is also greatly used for free-standing carvings and sculptures.

<doc id="1087792" wikidata="Q4899736" url="?curid=1087792" title="Bewbush">
<text>Bewbush is one of 14 neighbourhoods in Crawley in West Sussex, England. Bewbush is located in south west Crawley and is bordered by Broadfield to the south, Ifield to the north, Kilnwood Vale to the west and Gossops Green to the north east. The neighbourhood has a population of approximately 9,000.

==History==
A park was recorded at Bewbush as early as 1295. It was a manor which later became known as the Holmbush Estate. The manor belonged for most of the twentieth century to the Clifton Brown family. In 1973, some were purchased by Crawley Borough Council.

The manor house was first mentioned in the early 14th century, although this no longer remains. A building with some 17th-century elements remains, although it was clad in brick in the 19th century. The building now stands amid modern developments in the neighbourhood.

The borough council began development of the new neighbourhood of Bewbush in 1974, with a leisure centre opening in 1984, and a shopping parade the following year. Additional land was brought into the borough of Crawley from Lower Beeding in 1983 to see the extension of the neighbourhood to reach its capacity population of 9000. Development of the neighbourhood continued into the 1990s.

==Governance==
Bewbush neighbourhood is a co-terminus with the local government ward of Bewbush in the Borough of Crawley. It is also a ward of the upper-tier authority of West Sussex County Council.
The neighbourhood forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Crawley.

==Demography==

As at the 2001 census, the ward had a population of 9081. The neighbourhood has a younger population than the national average, with some 77% of residents being aged under 45, compared to 60% nationally. This is also reflected in the average age of the residents at 29, compared to 37 nationally.

Around 90% of the properties in the neighbourhood are terraced properties or flats. The vast majority of the properties were originally council-owned, with over one-third remaining owned by the local authority of other social landlords.

There is an ethnically diverse population in the neighbourhood, with a large proportion (17.3%) of black and ethnic minority groups represented. This is reflected in the area&#x27;s large Hindu and Muslim populations which are both well above the national averages at 9% and 5% respectively.

In terms of social classification, the neighbourhood is made up of approximately 45% in the ABC1 grouping, compared to the national figures of around 51%.

==Education==
Bewbush is served by two primary schools. The first school to open in the neighbourhood was Bewbush First School in 1978. This was shortly followed by Bewbush Middle School in 1982, with Waterfield First School opening officially in 1985. Bewbush first and middle schools were closed in 2004 when the three-tier education model was amended, and a new school - Bewbush Community Primary School, though it is currently called The Bewbush Academy Primary School, opened in the middle school buildings in September of that year. At the same time, Waterfield First School was extended to become Waterfield Primary School.

==Other Facilities==
There is a Church of England church named for Saint Mary Magdalene in the west of the neighbourhood. At the neighbourhood centre, alongside the primary school is a Sure Start Children and Family Centre and a doctor&#x27;s surgery. However, in March 2007, the local authority announced its intention to redevelop the area of central Bewbush. In 2009 the closure and demolition of the Bewbush Leisure Centre and The Dorsten public house took place, with the creation of a smaller pavilion style community building next to where the leisure centre had been. The new pavilion opened for use on 14 May the same year. A new park opened on 27 July 2009 on land that was previously part of Bewbush Primary School, which serves as a replacement for the old Bewbush Leisure Park. It holds various new playground equipment and England&#x27;s first training area for Parkour
Public transport is provided by the Metrobus bus routes, which include the 24-hour Crawley Fastway guided bus route to the Crawley Town centre and Gatwick Airport.

<doc id="1087808" wikidata="Q1759332" url="?curid=1087808" title="Middle of Nowhere (album)">
<text>Middle of Nowhere is the debut studio album by American pop rock group Hanson, and the first to be released on a major label, which was PolyGram Records and Mercury Records. Released in 1997, it features slicker studio production compared to their previous indie efforts &quot;Boomerang&quot; and &quot;MMMBop&quot;. The band members were between the ages of 11 and 16 when it was released. &quot;Yearbook&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s more dramatic songs, was not performed live until the recording of &quot;Middle of Nowhere Acoustic&quot; on May 5, 2007.

&quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; yielded five singles: &quot;MMMBop&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s the Love&quot;, &quot;I Will Come to You&quot;, &quot;Weird&quot;, and &quot;Thinking of You&quot;. &quot;MMMBop&quot; became a major hit, reaching number one in the United States and at least eleven other countries. The album earned Hanson three Grammy Award nominations, including Best New Artist and Record of the Year.

==Reception==
&quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, being kept out of the top spot by the Spice Girls&#x27; &quot;Spice&quot;. The album also reached number one in the UK, Australia, Germany, and Taiwan.

Total sales worldwide are 10 million copies. The album sold just under 4 million in the US (4 times platinum) and over 400,000 copies in UK.

The album was well received by critics. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said of the trio: &quot;... lack of guile is Hanson&#x27;s most endearing quality.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Isaac Hanson, Taylor Hanson and Zachary Hanson, with additional writers noted in parentheses.
#&quot;Thinking of You&quot; – 3:13
#&quot;MMMBop&quot; – 4:28
#&quot;Weird&quot; – 4:02 (Desmond Child)
#&quot;Speechless&quot; – 4:20 (Stephen Lironi)
#&quot;Where&#x27;s the Love&quot; – 4:13 (Mark Hudson, Sander Selover)

Note
*&quot;Man from Milwaukee&quot; is actually track #21, as there are eight tracks of silence after &quot;With You in Your Dreams&quot;. In Japan the song is track 14 because a remix of &quot;MMMBop&quot; serves as song 13. &quot;Man from Milwaukee&quot; was omitted from all cassettes and vinyl pressings of &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;. Some later reissues of the album in some locales including the remastered version and the digital download pressings omitted the tracks of silence and make &quot;Man from Milwaukee&quot; a true track 13.

<doc id="1087818" wikidata="Q1469423" url="?curid=1087818" title="Frobenius normal form">
<text>In linear algebra, the Frobenius normal form or rational canonical form of a square matrix &quot;A&quot; with entries in a field &quot;F&quot; is a canonical form for matrices obtained by conjugation by invertible matrices over &quot;F&quot;. The form reflects a minimal decomposition of the vector space into subspaces that are cyclic for &quot;A&quot; (i.e., spanned by some vector and its repeated images under &quot;A&quot;). Since only one normal form can be reached from a given matrix (whence the &quot;canonical&quot;), a matrix &quot;B&quot; is similar to &quot;A&quot; if and only if it has the same rational canonical form as &quot;A&quot;. Since this form can be found without any operations that might change when extending the field &quot;F&quot; (whence the &quot;rational&quot;), notably without factoring polynomials, this shows that whether two matrices are similar does not change upon field extensions. The form is named after German mathematician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.

Some authors use the term rational canonical form for a somewhat different form that is more properly called the primary rational canonical form. Instead of decomposing into a minimum number of cyclic subspaces, the primary form decomposes into a maximum number of cyclic subspaces. It is also defined over &quot;F&quot;, but has somewhat different properties: finding the form requires factorization of polynomials, and as a consequence the primary rational canonical form may change when the same matrix is considered over an extension field of &quot;F&quot;. This article mainly deals with the form that does not require factorization, and explicitly mentions &quot;primary&quot; when the form using factorization is meant.

== Motivation ==

When trying to find out whether two square matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar, one approach is to try, for each of them, to decompose the vector space as far as possible into a direct sum of stable subspaces, and compare the respective actions on these subspaces. For instance if both are diagonalizable, then one can take the decomposition into eigenspaces (for which the action is as simple as it can get, namely by a scalar), and then similarity can be decided by comparing eigenvalues and their multiplicities. While in practice this is often a quite insightful approach, there are various drawbacks this has as a general method. First, it requires finding all eigenvalues, say as roots of the characteristic polynomial, but it may not be possible to give an explicit expression for them. Second, a complete set of eigenvalues might exist only in an extension of the field one is working over, and then one does not get a proof of similarity over the original field. Finally &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; might not be diagonalizable even over this larger field, in which case one must instead use a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces, and possibly into Jordan blocks.

But obtaining such a fine decomposition is not necessary to just decide whether two matrices are similar. The rational canonical form is based on instead using a direct sum decomposition into stable subspaces that are as large as possible, while still allowing a very simple description of the action on each of them. These subspaces must be generated by a single nonzero vector &quot;v&quot; and all its images by repeated application of the linear operator associated to the matrix; such subspaces are called cyclic subspaces (by analogy with cyclic subgroups) and they are clearly stable under the linear operator. A basis of such a subspace is obtained by taking &quot;v&quot; and its successive images as long as they are linearly independent. The matrix of the linear operator with respect to such a basis is the companion matrix of a monic polynomial; this polynomial (the minimal polynomial of the operator restricted to the subspace, which notion is analogous to that of the order of a cyclic subgroup) determines the action of the operator on the cyclic subspace up to isomorphism, and is independent of the choice of the vector &quot;v&quot; generating the subspace.

A direct sum decomposition into cyclic subspaces always exists, and finding one does not require factoring polynomials. However it is possible that cyclic subspaces do allow a decomposition as direct sum of smaller cyclic subspaces (essentially by the Chinese remainder theorem). Therefore, just having for both matrices some decomposition of the space into cyclic subspaces, and knowing the corresponding minimal polynomials, is not in itself sufficient to decide their similarity. An additional condition is imposed to ensure that for similar matrices one gets decompositions into cyclic subspaces that exactly match: in the list of associated minimal polynomials each one must divide the next (and the constant polynomial 1 is forbidden to exclude trivial cyclic subspaces). The resulting list of polynomials are called the invariant factors of (the &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-module defined by) the matrix, and two matrices are similar if and only if they have identical lists of invariant factors. The rational canonical form of a matrix &quot;A&quot; is obtained by expressing it on a basis adapted to a decomposition into cyclic subspaces whose associated minimal polynomials are the invariant factors of &quot;A&quot;; two matrices are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form.

== Example ==
Consider the following matrix A, over Q:

:formula_1

&quot;A&quot; has minimal polynomial formula_2, so that the dimension of a subspace generated by the repeated images of a single vector is at most 6. The characteristic polynomial is formula_3, which is a multiple of the minimal polynomial by a factor formula_4. There always exist vectors such that the cyclic subspace that they generate has the same minimal polynomial as the operator has on the whole space; indeed most vectors will have this property, and in this case the first standard basis vector formula_5 does so: the vectors formula_6 for formula_7 are linearly independent and span a cyclic subspace with minimal polynomial formula_8. There exist complementary stable subspaces (of dimension 2) to this cyclic subspace, and the space generated by vectors formula_9 and formula_10 is an example. In fact one has formula_11, so the complementary subspace is a cyclic subspace generated by formula_12; it has minimal polynomial formula_4. Since formula_8 is the minimal polynomial of the whole space, it is clear that formula_4 must divide formula_8 (and it is easily checked that it does), and we have found the invariant factors formula_4 and formula_2 of &quot;A&quot;. Then the rational canonical form of &quot;A&quot; is the block diagonal matrix with the corresponding companion matrices as diagonal blocks, namely
:formula_19
A basis on which this form is attained is formed by the vectors formula_20 above, followed by formula_6 for formula_7; explicitly this means that for
:formula_23,

one has formula_24

==General case and theory==
Fix a base field &quot;F&quot; and a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over &quot;F&quot;. Given a polynomial &quot;P&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;], there is associated to it a companion matrix &quot;C&quot;&quot;P&quot; whose characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial are both equal to &quot;P&quot;.

Theorem: Let &quot;V&quot; be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; a square matrix over &quot;F&quot;. Then &quot;V&quot; (viewed as an &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-module with the action of &quot;X&quot; given by &quot;A&quot;) admits a &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-module isomorphism

:&quot;V&quot; ≅ &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]/&quot;f&quot;1 ⊕ … ⊕ &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]/&quot;fk&quot;

where the &quot;fi&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] may be taken to be monic polynomials of positive degree (so they are non-units in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]) that satisfy the relations

:&quot;f&quot;1 | &quot;f&quot;2 | … | &quot;fk&quot;

(where &quot;a | b&quot; is notation for &quot;&quot;a&quot; divides &quot;b&quot;&quot;); with these conditions the list of polynomials &quot;fi&quot; is unique.

&quot;Sketch of Proof&quot;: Apply the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to &quot;V&quot;, viewing it as an &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]-module. The structure theorem provides a decomposition into cyclic factors, each of which is a quotient of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] by a proper ideal; the zero ideal cannot be present since the resulting free module would be infinite-dimensional as &quot;F&quot; vector space, while &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional. For the polynomials &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; one then takes the unique monic generators of the respective ideals, and since the structure theorem ensures containment of every ideal in the preceding ideal, one obtains the divisibility conditions for the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;. See [DF] for details.

Given an arbitrary square matrix, the elementary divisors used in the construction of the Jordan normal form do not exist over &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;], so the invariant factors &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; as given above must be used instead. The last of these factors &quot;fk&quot; is then the minimal polynomial, which all the 
invariant factors therefore divide, and the product of the invariant factors gives the characteristic polynomial. Note that this implies that the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial (which is essentially the Cayley-Hamilton theorem), and that every irreducible factor of the characteristic polynomial also divides the minimal polynomial (possibly with lower multiplicity).

For each invariant factor &quot;fi&quot; one takes its companion matrix &quot;C&quot;&quot;fi&quot;, and the block diagonal matrix formed from these blocks yields the rational canonical form of &quot;A&quot;. When the minimal polynomial is identical to the characteristic polynomial (the case &quot;k&quot; = 1), the Frobenius normal form is the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial. As the rational canonical form is uniquely determined by the unique invariant factors associated to &quot;A&quot;, and these invariant factors are independent of basis, it follows that two square matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form.

== A rational normal form generalizing the Jordan normal form ==

The Frobenius normal form does not reflect any form of factorization of the characteristic polynomial, even if it does exist over the ground field &quot;F&quot;. This implies that it is invariant when &quot;F&quot; is replaced by a different field (as long as it contains the entries of the original matrix &quot;A&quot;). On the other hand, this makes the Frobenius normal form rather different from other normal forms that do depend on factoring the characteristic polynomial, notably the diagonal form (if &quot;A&quot; is diagonalizable) or more generally the Jordan normal form (if the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors). For instance, the Frobenius normal form of a diagonal matrix with distinct diagonal entries is just the companion matrix of its characteristic polynomial.

There is another way to define a normal form, that, like the Frobenius normal form, is always defined over the same field &quot;F&quot; as &quot;A&quot;, but that does reflect a possible factorization of the characteristic polynomial (or equivalently the minimal polynomial) into irreducible factors over &quot;F&quot;, and which reduces to the Jordan normal form when this factorization only contains linear factors (corresponding to eigenvalues). This form is sometimes called the generalized Jordan normal form, or primary rational canonical form. It is based on the fact that the vector space can be canonically decomposed into a direct sum of stable subspaces corresponding to the &quot;distinct&quot; irreducible factors &quot;P&quot; of the characteristic polynomial (as stated by the ), where the characteristic polynomial of each summand is a power of the corresponding &quot;P&quot;. These summands can be further decomposed, non-canonically, as a direct sum of cyclic &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]-modules (like is done for the Frobenius normal form above), where the characteristic polynomial of each summand is still a (generally smaller) power of &quot;P&quot;. The primary rational canonical form is a block diagonal matrix corresponding to such a decomposition into cyclic modules, with a particular form called &quot;generalized Jordan block&quot; in the diagonal blocks, corresponding to a particular choice of a basis for the cyclic modules. This generalized Jordan block is itself a block matrix of the form

:formula_25

where &quot;C&quot; is the companion matrix of the irreducible polynomial , and is a matrix whose sole nonzero entry is a 1 in the upper right-hand corner. For the case of a linear irreducible factor , these blocks are reduced to single entries and and, one finds a (transposed) Jordan block. In any generalized Jordan block, all entries immediately below the main diagonal are 1. A basis of the cyclic module giving rise to this form is obtained by choosing a generating vector (one that is not annihilated by where the minimal polynomial of the cyclic module is ), and taking as basis

<text>Cake Like was an all-female indie rock band based in New York City. Its members were bassist and lead singer Kerri Kenney, drummer Jody Seifert, and vocalist and guitarist Nina Hellman. The band came together in 1993 when Kenney and Hellman met at New York University&#x27;s Experimental Theater Wing, decided to form a band, and were joined by Hellman&#x27;s roommate Seifert. The members had never played music before and so developed their own unique style. Their songs often play out like poetry set to erratic guitar-rock. They soon attracted the attention of John Zorn, who signed the band to his Avant Records label, which released their first LP. Ric Ocasek, formerly of The Cars, produced their follow-up EP. Subsequently, Neil Young signed the band to his Vapor Records label, which released their second and third LPs.

The band dissolved in 1999 when Kenney relocated to Los Angeles. However, on her appearance on &quot;The JV Club&quot; podcast, Kenney stated that the group still owes Vapor Records another album, saying &quot;I like that it&#x27;s out there, floating around that maybe some day we would.&quot;

Kenney, now known as Kerri Kenney-Silver, is an actress and comedian known for her work in such series as &quot;The State&quot;, &quot;The Ellen Show&quot;, and &quot;Reno 911!&quot; Nina Hellman is also an actress and works in the theatre in New York and appeared in the film &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;, as well as providing voices for several episodes of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; Seifert works in the fashion industry.

Cake Like also appears in a deleted sketch for &quot;The State&quot; entitled &quot;The Muskrats&quot;. The band is featured at the end, playing the school&#x27;s &quot;fighting song&quot;. The sketch was released on &quot;The State&quot; DVD box-set in 2009.

<doc id="1087834" wikidata="Q412165" url="?curid=1087834" title="Ajattara">
<text>Ajattara is a sextet black metal band from Helsinki, Finland, led by Pasi Koskinen (ex Amorphis). They formed in 1996, split up in 2012, and reformed in 2016. They were signed to Spinefarm Records and have released eight albums, their most recent being &quot;Lupaus&quot;, which was released in May 2017.

==History==
Ajattara formed in 1996 as a side project of Amorphis singer Pasi Koskinen. Their first release was a demo tape entitled &quot;Helvetissä on syntisen taivas&quot; which was released in 1998. The band then signed to Spikefarm Records and went on to release three albums - &quot;Itse&quot; in 2001, &quot;Kuolema&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Tyhjyys&quot; in 2004. These albums were met with largely good reviews. Ajattara released the Christmas singles &quot;Ilon juhla&quot; in November 2004 and &quot;Joulu&quot; in November 2005. The band then went on to release another album in 2006, entitled &quot;Äpäre&quot;, which was met with similar reviews as their last three albums. The band continued with the Christmas single tradition of 2004 and 2005 by releasing a single entitled &quot;Sika&quot; in 2006.

The band entered the studio on 1 June 2007 to begin recording on the album &quot;Kalmanto&quot; which was released on 5 September 2007. However, this album was not met with such good reviews as Ajattara&#x27;s other albums, as some critics said the album sounded chaotic and forced. In April 2009 Ajattara released their sixth album entitled &quot;Noitumaa&quot;, this time being an all-acoustic album, which received clearly better reviews than the previous release. In 2011 the band released their seventh studio album &quot;Murhat&quot;.

The band made an announcement on its Facebook page on 15 April 2012 that it had split up for reasons unknown.

On 23 March 2016 the band made an announcement on their Facebook page that they will be playing at the Norwegian Blastfest in February 2017. Shortly after, on 9 May 2016, Pasi Koskinen announced the reunion of the band, announcing further live dates including Nummirock 2016 in Finland and Satan&#x27;s Convention 2017 in Germany.
In May 2017 the band released &quot;Lupaus&quot;, their eighth studio album and first since their reformation.

==Musical style==
Ajattara combine elements of black metal to produce a style of black metal not dissimilar to Celtic Frost, and to a lesser extent Samael. The combined use of synthesisers and heavy guitar sounds give Ajattara a distinct sound. The lyrical themes of Ajattara usually deal with death, evil and paganism.

==Controversies==

===Mises&#x27; &quot;Human Action&quot;===
In 1963, the Press published a revised edition of Ludwig von Mises&#x27;s &quot;Human Action&quot;. In the May 5, 1964 issue of &quot;National Review&quot;, Henry Hazlitt wrote the story &quot;Mangling a Masterpiece&quot;, accusing Yale University Press of intentionally typesetting the new edition in an amateurish fashion, due to the Press&#x27;s differing ideological beliefs.

===Muhammad cartoons===
In August 2009, officials at the Press ignited a controversy when they decided to expunge reproductions of the cartoons involved in the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, along with all other images of Muhammad, from a scholarly book entitled &quot;The Cartoons that Shook the World&quot;, by professor Jytte Klausen.

===Internet Archive Lawsuit===
Yale University Press joined The Association of American Publishers trade organization in the Hachette v. Internet Archive lawsuit which resulted in the removal of access to over 500,000 books from global readers.

He received his education at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College and completed his studies in 1956. Then he continued his education at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK) for 2 years. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honors in literature and the humanities from Universiti Malaya and an Honorary Doctorate from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

==Career and post==
Razali Ismail first joined the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1962 and went on to become the Ministry&#x27;s Deputy Secretary-General in 1985. Before he was appointed to the post, he served as the Malaysia&#x27;s Assistant High Commissioner in Madras from 1963 to 1964, Second Secretary of Malaysia&#x27;s Embassy in Paris in between 1966 and 1968, the Counsellor in the Malaysian High Commission in London from 1970 until 1972 and the Chargé d&#x27;affaires in Vientiane from 1974 until 1976. He was later the Malaysian Ambassador to Poland from 1978 to 1982 and to India between 1982 and 1985.

After his tenure as Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; Deputy Secretary-General, he became increasingly involved with the United Nations. In 1989 and 1990, he headed the Malaysian delegation to the United Nations. At the same time, he was the chairman of United Nations Security Council.

However, his impartiality as a UN Special Envoy was questioned by American officials in an embassy cable that was released via Wikileaks, alleging his business ties with the Burmese military regime. Later however, Myanmar military junta repeatedly denied him entry to Myanmar, contributing to his decision to quit the special envoy status in December 2005.

<doc id="1087894" wikidata="Q1173031" url="?curid=1087894" title="Jackson Browne (album)">
<text>Jackson Browne (also known, mistakenly, as Saturate Before Using) is the debut album of American singer Jackson Browne, released in 1972. It peaked on the Billboard 200 chart at number 53. Two singles were released with &quot;Doctor, My Eyes&quot;, which peaked at number 8 on the Pop Singles chart, and &quot;Rock Me on the Water&quot;, which reached number 48.

==History==
Browne had found minor success as a songwriter but had not yet obtained his own recording contract. After he sent a demo of &quot;Jamaica Say You Will&quot; to David Geffen in early 1970, Geffen began looking for a record deal for Browne. Geffen ended up founding his own label, Asylum Records, and signed Browne.

The album was certified as a Gold record in 1976 and Platinum in 1997 by the RIAA.

==Title confusion==
The album is often mistakenly called Saturate Before Using, because the words appear on the album cover, which was designed to look like a water bag that would require saturation in water in order to cool its contents by evaporation. For this very reason, Asylum Records executives suggested to no avail that the words be removed from the album cover and nearly rejected the cover art outright. However, the initial pressings not only included the text, but the cover carried a burlap-like feel to further the water bag theme.

The confusion over the title returned when the album was converted to CD format, when the words appeared on the spine of the jewel case as the album title.

Browne told the story of the cover&#x27;s creation and spoke of the title&#x27;s confusion in an interview with the album designer Gary Burden for his 2002 DVD &quot;Under The Covers&quot;: &quot;I remember being on the phone with Gary... talking about what the album cover should be, and I happened to be in a room that had a water bag on the wall. It was just one of the things that I collected driving around on trips and stuff. And I was looking at this bag as he was saying &#x27;what do you think it ought to be?&#x27; I was thinking, &#x27;well, it could be a water bag.&#x27; ... it said &#x27;saturate before using&#x27; on the front ... &#x27;You know, Gary, on mine, it says this on the back.&#x27; And you said, well, so?&#x27; And &#x27;if you put it on the front, people are going to think that&#x27;s the title.&#x27; And you said, &#x27;don&#x27;t be ridiculous. Who would think that was the title?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yeah, you&#x27;re right.&#x27; So, not only does everyone think that&#x27;s the title of that album, but my record company thinks that&#x27;s the title of the album.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Jackson Browne&quot; received positive reviews from most critics. In his review for Allmusic William Ruhlmann praised the album as &quot;An auspicious debut that doesn&#x27;t sound like a debut&quot; and &quot;the album has long since come to seem a timeless collection of reflective ballads touching on still-difficult subjects...and all with an amazingly eloquent sense of language. Jackson Browne&#x27;s greater triumph is that, having perfectly expressed its times, it transcended them as well.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the album 6 of 10 stars and stated &quot;Browne&#x27;s debut lays the groundwork for future heart-and-soul excavations. &#x27;Doctor My Eyes,&#x27; an early hit single, communicates the subdued, subtle power of his half-spoken melodies, while &#x27;Rock Me on the Water&#x27; and &#x27;Song for Adam&#x27; foreshadow the free-ranging contemplation to come.&quot;

The original 1972 review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated &quot;Jackson Browne&#x27;s sensibility is romantic in the best sense of the term: his songs are capable of generating a highly charged, compelling atmosphere throughout, and--just as important--of sustaining that pitch in the listener&#x27;s mind long after they&#x27;ve ended.&quot; Ed Kelleher wrote in &quot;Circus&quot; in 1972: &quot;Though others have done him justice, Browne is his own best interpreter. He just eases back and lets the song come. He has the soul of a poet and the stance of a troubadour. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he has not fallen victim to the trap of over-production--the record has been crafted with care and purity.&quot;

Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B grade, however, and was ambivalent about the whole album, writing, &quot;The voice is pleasant, present, and unpretentious, and when I listen assiduously I perceive lyrics crafted with as much intelligence and human decency as any reasonable person could expect. Unfortunately, only critical responsibility induces me to listen assiduously. It&#x27;s not just the blandness of the music, but of the ideas as well, each reinforcing the other.&quot;

<doc id="1087895" wikidata="Q2349343" url="?curid=1087895" title="Eating Raoul">
<text>Eating Raoul is a 1982 American black comedy film written, directed by and starring Paul Bartel with Mary Woronov, Robert Beltran, Ed Begley Jr., Buck Henry, and Susan Saiger. It is about a prudish married couple (Bartel and Woronov) who resort to killing and robbing affluent swingers to earn money for their dream restaurant.

The writers commissioned a single-issue comic book based on the film for promotion; it was created by underground comix creator Kim Deitch.

==Plot==
Paul Bland is a wine snob who works at a cheap wine shop. His attractive wife Mary is a nurse who is routinely groped by hospital patients. When Paul is fired, they are left with barely enough money to survive and fear that they will never realize their dream of opening a restaurant. Paul and Mary sleep in separate twin beds, since they are prudes who disapprove of sex. They live in an apartment building which regularly hosts swingers parties, which they despise.

When a drunk swinger wanders into their apartment and tries to rape Mary, Paul hits him on the head with a cast-iron frying pan, unintentionally killing him. Thinking that no one will miss him, they take his money and put his body in the trash compactor. After they kill another swinger the same way, they realize they can make money by killing &quot;rich perverts&quot;.

Doris the Dominatrix, a regular at the swingers parties, advises Paul and Mary to place an ad in the &quot;Hollywood Press&quot;, which caters to men seeking kinky sex scenes. Mary lures men to the apartment by promising to satisfy their sexual fetishes; when they try to have sex with her, Paul grows alarmed enough to kill them with the frying pan. The Blands are surprised at how lucrative their scheme is.

The Blands have new locks installed in their apartment to protect Paul&#x27;s wine collection. The locksmith is Raoul Mendoza, whose service is a ruse which allows him to rob his customers&#x27; homes. He sneaks into the Blands&#x27; apartment the next night and stumbles across the corpse of their latest victim. Paul confronts Raoul and both men realize they are in a compromising position. They strike a deal: neither will report the other to the police, Paul and Mary will pocket their victims&#x27; cash, and Raoul will keep their other possessions — splitting any proceeds with them — and dispose of the bodies.

When a client of Mary&#x27;s fails to show one night, Paul leaves to buy groceries and a new frying pan, since Mary is squeamish about cooking in the one they use to kill people. While Mary is alone, the client arrives late and tries to rape her. Raoul drops by and strangles the client to death. He offers Mary a joint and they have sex. After Paul grows suspicious, he follows Raoul and discovers he has been selling the victims&#x27; bodies to a dog food company, selling their expensive cars, and secretly keeping the money.

Raoul tries to persuade Mary to run away with him after they have sex again. He nearly runs down Paul with a car, so Paul hires Doris the Dominatrix to use her costuming and role-playing skills to get rid of him. She poses as an immigration agent threatening Raoul, a Mexican immigrant, with deportation. She pretends to be a public health worker who diagnoses him with venereal disease. The pills she promises will cure him are actually saltpeter tablets which render him impotent. These schemes fail to deter Raoul&#x27;s interest in Mary.

The Blands fear they will lose the property they wish to buy for the restaurant to another buyer. To quickly earn more cash, they attend a swingers party in search of victims. Mr. Leech, a bank lender who earlier refused to loan Mary money after she rejected his sexual advances, sees her at the party and propositions her. Mary kills him with a rattail comb and throws his body from a window. While Paul and Mary try to retrieve Mr. Leech&#x27;s possessions, the party&#x27;s host demands they join the nude guests in the hot tub or leave. Paul loses his temper and hurls an electric space heater into the hot tub, killing all of the partygoers and enabling him and Mary to take their money and sell their cars.

A drunken Raoul breaks into the Blands&#x27; apartment and threatens to kill Paul for not sharing the money earned from the swingers&#x27; cars. He announces that he intends to wed Mary and tells her to kill Paul with the frying pan. Instead, Mary lures Raoul into the kitchen and murders him.

Mary confesses her affair with Raoul to Paul, who tells her that he already knows. The Blands suddenly remember that James, the real estate agent who is helping them buy the property for the restaurant, will arrive for dinner soon. With no meat in the house and no time to go grocery shopping, they cook Raoul and serve him for dinner, describing the dish as &quot;Spanish&quot;. The Blands buy the building for their new restaurant, Paul and Mary&#x27;s Country Kitchen.

==Cast==
==Critical reception==
Roger Ebert gave &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; two stars, explaining: &quot;The movie&#x27;s got some really funny stuff in it, and I liked a lot of it, and I wouldn&#x27;t exactly advise not seeing it, but it doesn&#x27;t quite go that last mile. It doesn&#x27;t reach for the truly unacceptable excesses, the transcendent breaches of taste, that might have made it inspired instead of merely clever.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;One mustn&#x27;t blunt its pleasures by calling it a laff riot. It is full of smiles, punctuated here and there by marvelously unseemly guffaws, but most of the time it works its little wonders quietly. The comic style is purposely flat, plain and ordinary, like a piece of Pop art.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 86%, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10, based on 21 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus for the film reads: &quot;&quot;Eating Raoul&quot; serves up its spectacularly lurid tale with a healthy heaping of pitch-black humor and anarchic vigor.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Eating Raoul&quot; was first released in 1984 on VHS by CBS/FOX Video. On April 13, 2004, the long out-of-print film was released on DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.

On September 25, 2012, The Criterion Collection re-released the film on DVD and Blu-ray.

==Legacy==
Woronov and Bartel later appeared together as Mary and Paul Bland in a cameo in the film &quot;Chopping Mall&quot; (1986). Woronov and Beltran appeared again in &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; (1984), but not as their &quot;Eating Raoul&quot; characters; the two also starred together in Bartel&#x27;s feature &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; in 1989.

===Musical===
&quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, a stage musical adaptation, was presented off-Broadway in 1992, and also played at the Bridewell Theatre in London in 2000.

===Planned sequel===
A sequel, titled &quot;Bland Ambition&quot;, was planned. The script was written by Paul Bartel and Richard Blackburn. As described by Bartel:

&quot;Bland Ambition&quot; was about 10 days from the start of filming in April 1989 when Vestron withdrew its financial backing.

<text>B&amp;Q Limited (short for Block &amp; Quayle after the company&#x27;s two founders) is a British multinational DIY, home improvement and garden centre retailing company, with headquarters in Eastleigh, England. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingfisher plc. It was founded in March 1969 by Richard Block and David Quayle.

It is the UK&#x27;s largest home improvement retailer, serving both the general public and tradespeople. In contrast, its competitor Wickes primarily caters to trade professionals and does not sell soft homewares or operate garden centres. Where the British home improvement sector faced hostile competition in the 1990s, B&amp;Q has become the dominant retailer in its sector following the collapse of Focus in 2011, and Homebase in 2025.

==History==
===1969 to 1979: Early growth===
B&amp;Q was founded in March 1969 in Southampton, England, by Richard Block and David Quayle, following the purchase and fitting out of a former furniture warehouse in the Southampton suburb of Portswood. Originally called Block &amp; Quayle, the duo soon shortened the brand to B&amp;Q as stock delivery notes and invoices were already unofficially abbreviating the name.

By each working over sixty-hour, six-day weeks, they were able to repay their bank overdraft within six months of opening, with turnover reaching £1 million within the first five years of operating. The chain quickly expanded, and by 1979, there were 26 shops across the United Kingdom.

Co-founder Block left the company in 1976.

===1980s: Buyout and further expansion===
B&amp;Q grew rapidly through a combination of mergers, acquisitions and expansions, such as the acquisition of a Hampshire based company Dodge City at the beginning of the 1980s. The chain was itself acquired by the F. W. Woolworth Company for £16.8 million at the beginning of the 1980s, coinciding with Quayle, who by that time had a personal wealth of £4 million, selling his share. This would result, for a time, in B&amp;Q being an indirect sister company to Foot Locker, another F. W. Woolworth subsidiary.

Two years later, F. W. Woolworth&#x27;s United Kingdom subsidiary (Woolworth&#x27;s Ltd.) and B&amp;Q were purchased by Paternoster Stores, which became Kingfisher plc and is still B&amp;Q&#x27;s parent company .

B&amp;Q developed two new trading formats: HomeCentres, retailing furniture, bathrooms, soft furniture, flooring and lighting; and AutoCentres, being similar to a Halfords, the first launch taking place at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, at the end of the 1980s. The concept being to have a HomeCentre, AutoCentre and DIY Superstore with one communal car park.

The forays into these new markets were relatively short lived, and the various sites were sold on a couple of years later. The AutoCentres becoming in the main &#x27;Charlie Browns&#x27;, the HomeCentres being sold off individually.

===1990s===

In the mid 1990s, B&amp;Q opened a new format of shop known as the Depot (later changed to B&amp;Q Depot), a forerunner of a new class of shop known as the B&amp;Q Warehouse. This new store format was almost identical to that of the US chain Home Depot, where the stores were built on a much bigger scale with a larger floor area, merchandise presented on two storey, industrial-style shelving and an enhanced range of product lines which now extended to bulk building materials. For the branding of these new stores B&amp;Q also moved to a new corporate colour style of orange (away from the previous black/red) which again was almost the same as Home Depot. For this reason, it is often erroneously believed that there is a formal connection between the two compainies. The company also began to expand outside the United Kingdom. In 1995, the retailer opened their first overseas subsidiary in Taiwan, and in January 1996, the first overseas large home improvement centre in Taoyuan City, Taiwan.

In September 1998, it acquired NOMI, Poland&#x27;s leading chain of DIY shops, and later that year, merged with France&#x27;s Castorama.

===2000s===
In December 2000, Kingfisher plc acquired 28 development sites, intended to house future shops of rival chain Homebase from Sainsbury&#x27;s, who sold the chain. The development sites instead housed shops of B&amp;Q. In August 2001, B&amp;Q opened its first shop in Shanghai, when it hoped to increase outlets from four to 58 by 2005.

B&amp;Q opened its first shop in Hong Kong on 1 June 2007, but was scheduled to close it on 13 September 2009. In December 2007, Kingfisher sold its 50 per cent stake in B&amp;Q Taiwan to its joint venture partner. The $106.5 million (£51.6 million) sale, producing a profit of £25 million, was used to reduce debt.

In March 2009, B&amp;Q closed 22 of its then 63 shops in China, blaming the housing slump.

===2010s===
In May 2011, B&amp;Q agreed to acquire 31 shops in the United Kingdom, from the administrators of Focus DIY for £23 million. During 2011, B&amp;Q opened a new regional distribution centre, at G.Park in Swindon.

===2020s===
In 2020, B&amp;Q announced a sales increase of 17.6pc to £3.5 billion for the quarter to 31 October, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during which people spent money on home improvements.

In 2021, B&amp;Q announced the launch of its new website in the Republic of Ireland.

In 2022, B&amp;Q opened its first two shops in Saudi Arabia, in the capital, Riyadh.

In May 2023, B&amp;Q opened new distribution centre in Bassetlaw. Later, in August, B&amp;Q opened in Sutton, the UK.

In January 2024, B&amp;Q unveiled its plan to open its tenth local store on Staines high street. Later in February, B&amp;Q announced its increase of its hourly rate of pay for its UK employees to £12.21 and up to £13.55 in London. Also in 2024, B&amp;Q reported the opening of its new store in Staines.

In January 2025, B&amp;Q announced they would acquire five Homebase locations from the administrators; they had previously announced they would rescue three Homebase stores in the Republic of Ireland.

==Brands==
Diall (standing for &#x27;Do It All&#x27;) is a B&amp;Q brand.

GoodHome is the main own-brand at B&amp;Q stores, ranging from the complete kitchen collection, to paint, decsundries and more.

==Customers==
B&amp;Q were reported to have a customer base of seven million in July 2016, of which it was estimated 75% use the retailer&#x27;s website to research their desired products, prior to purchasing in shop. 

B&amp;Q operated a &quot;Diamond Club&quot; scheme which offered some benefits, but it was closed to new members in 2018. It still can be used by established members, but only on exterior &amp; ‘seasonal’ products.

==Corporate affairs==
The retail chain offers over 40,000 products across their 300 shops and through their online presence. Reports in May 2007 suggested it was the second largest in Europe, and the fourth largest in the world (behind the Home Depot, Lowe&#x27;s and OBI).

===Shops===

By 2000, B&amp;Q had 51 large warehouse shops; this had doubled by 2003. By May 2014, B&amp;Q in the United Kingdom had 359 shops, and 20,887 employees; and eight shops in Ireland.

In March 2015, Kingfisher said it would close 60 B&amp;Q shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland over the next two years, and a few loss-making shops elsewhere in Europe. It also said that B&amp;Q UK and Ireland could adequately meet local customer needs, from fewer shops, and some shops should be smaller.

===Financial performance===
B&amp;Q account for around a third of their parent company&#x27;s revenues, seeing like for like sales increase by 5.6% in August 2016. In the year ending 31 January 2007, sales were £3.9 billion despite overall sales falling by 1.7% compared to the previous year, whilst profit was £162.9 million, a fall from £208.5 million during the previous year. Profit fell further in the year ending 31 January 2008, to £131 million.

In March 2013, it was reported that the retail chain&#x27;s Ireland operation was making losses, with their then nine shops making a combined loss of £7 million throughout 2012, yet its operations within the United Kingdom turned a profit despite an overall decrease in sales by 5.6%.

==International operations==
Outside the United Kingdom, B&amp;Q&#x27;s other international operations are in Ireland and, since 2022, in Saudi Arabia. On 31 January 2013, B&amp;Q Ireland Ltd filed for examinership in the Irish courts and PWC Ireland was appointed examiner, though shops continued to trade while alternative financing arrangements were made.

B&amp;Q Ireland had been making a loss since two years before, although the shops in the United Kingdom continued to stay in profit. The chain exited examinership a few months later in May 2013, following High Court approval for investment totalling €2.4 million to allow eight of their nine shops to continue operating.

B&amp;Q expanded into China during 1999, building up a chain of nearly 40 shops, but opted to sell a 70% controlling stake of operations in China to Wumart in 2015, due to poor sales. B&amp;Q&#x27;s parent company had previously sold its 50% stake in B&amp;Q Taiwan in 2007 in order to focus on what was then a rapidly growing business in China.

==Incidents==
In June 2001, in Poole, Dorset, 69-year-old customer Pamela Jean Hinchliffe was fatally crushed by a forklift at the firm&#x27;s Fleetsbridge shop. In June 2004, B&amp;Q were found guilty of causing her death, and the following month they were fined £550,000.

In July 2017, B&amp;Q faced widespread criticism from customers complaining of bad smells and headaches after painting their homes with Valspar paint sold to them. This led to B&amp;Q compensating hundreds of customers, with the problem said to be caused by bacterial contamination in the can causing emission of hydrogen sulphide and ammonia.

<text>Cape Wanbrow is a rocky headland overlooking Oamaru Harbour, New Zealand. Although it has been a commercial forestry area for a number of decades, the cape is now primarily a Council controlled reserve, and is gradually being replanted with native trees and shrubs. It has a network of walking tracks and mountain bike tracks, and is popular with the public.

Cape Wanbrow was an important lookout point during the Second World War and hosts a gun emplacement and remains of the original magazine which served the fortified gun. Below the cape on its north side is a protected area which is home to a blue penguin colony, and rare yellow eyed penguins are to the south of the cape. New Zealand fur seals and occasionally elephant seals are found resting on the rocks.

The geology of the rock making up the cape is complex as layered within the sedimentary rocks are no less than 6 Surtseyan volcanoes of the monogenetic Waiareka-Deborah volcanic field.

<doc id="1087936" wikidata="Q1324437" url="?curid=1087936" title="Femunden">
<text>Femunden is Norway&#x27;s third largest lake and the second largest natural lake in Norway. It is located in Innlandet and Trøndelag counties in Norway, just west of the border with Sweden. The lake lies primarily in Engerdal Municipality (in Innlandet) and also smaller parts are located in Os Municipality (Innlandet) and Røros Municipality (Trøndelag). Femundsmarka National Park borders the northeastern part of the lake.
The lake holds about of water and reaches a maximum depth of . The surface of the lake sits about above sea level.

==Name==
The first element (&quot;Fe-&quot; or &quot;Fem-&quot;) has no known meaning, and the last element is the suffix &quot;-mund&quot; or &quot;-und&quot; (both are common in Norwegian place names). The final part &quot;-en&quot; is the definite article in the Norwegian language.

==History==
After Sweden had conquered the parishes of Idre and Särna in 1644, the lake Femunden was considered to be part of the border between Norway and Sweden. But this was never officially recognised by the Dano-Norwegian government (since Norway was ruled from Copenhagen in the early modern age), and during border adjustments in 1751 the Femundsmarka area east of the lake was granted to Norway from Sweden. 

The new (and current) border from 1751 is quite special: For a length of , it makes a completely straight line between the summits of the tall mountain Våndsjögusten and the tall mountain Østerhogna. Straight-line national borders are very unusual in Scandinavia, except in the very northernmost parts.

<doc id="1087937" wikidata="Q1990140" url="?curid=1087937" title="Bull Nakano">
<text>is a Japanese retired professional wrestler and professional golfer better known as . She began competing in All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling (AJW) as a teenager under the ring name Bull Nakano. As a wrestler she was a villain, who often teamed with her mentor Dump Matsumoto. In Japan, she held several of AJW&#x27;s singles and tag team championships. After being phased out by the company in the early 1990s, she traveled to North America, where she first competed in Mexico&#x27;s Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), becoming its first World Women&#x27;s Champion. In 1994, she made her way to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where she had feuded with Alundra Blayze over the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship. After holding the title once, she also competed in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In 1998, Nakano began competing as a professional golfer, and in 2006, she joined a tour with the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). She was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame on 2001 and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Professional wrestling career==
===All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling (1983–1996)===
Nakano&#x27;s career as a professional wrestler began in All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro-Wrestling (AJW) organization in Japan when she was 15 years old. After winning the AJW Junior Championship at the age of 16 in 1984, her ring name was changed to Bull Nakano. In July 1985, she won the AJW Championship, which she held for the next three years. Meanwhile, she teamed with Dump Matsumoto, who was also her mentor, as a pair of heels. With Matsumoto as her partner, Nakano won the WWWA World Tag Team Championship in August 1986. Nakano and Matsumoto also wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation in 1986 against the team of Velvet McIntyre and Dawn Marie Johnston.

After Matsumoto&#x27;s retirement, Nakano won the WWWA World Tag Team Championship a second and third time, with Condor Saito in 1987 and Grizzly Iwamoto in 1988. As a singles wrestler, she won the 1988 Japan Grand Prix in June. One year later in June 1989, she also defeated Mitsuko Nishiwaki to win AJW&#x27;s All Pacific Championship, which she lost to Noriyo Tateno in November. Around the start of the 1990s, Nakano began to be positioned as the ace of AJW. In January 1990, Nakano won a tournament final to win the vacant WWWA World Single Championship. She held the title for nearly three years, before dropping it to Aja Kong in November 1992. Afterward, AJW&#x27;s use of Nakano in storylines and matches decreased.

===Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (1992–1993)===
After she stopped working for AJW, Nakano traveled to Mexico in June 1992, where she was a finalist in a 12-woman battle royal and later defeated Lola González to become Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre&#x27;s first World Women&#x27;s Champion. She lost the title to Xóchitl Hamada in March 1993.

===World Wrestling Federation (1994–1995)===
She then made her way to the United States and competed for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) once again. Debuting as an associate of Luna Vachon, Nakano competed against the WWF Women&#x27;s Champion, Alundra Blayze in August 1994 at SummerSlam, but failed to win the title. Nakano eventually defeated Blayze for the title on November 20, 1994, in Tokyo at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Among her defenses was a victory over Kyoko Inoue in March 1995 in the semi-main event of AJW&#x27;s Wrestling Queendom &quot;Victory&quot; show. Nakano&#x27;s title run lasted for approximately five months, until she lost it back to Blayze on the April 3, 1995, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (in a match taped weeks prior) ending her reign at 134 days. The rematch occurred in the wake of Wrestlemania XI the night before. The WWF had planned on bringing in Bertha Faye to feud with Nakano while Blayze got plastic surgery on her nose and breasts.

It would be her last match in the company, having been released soon after for allegedly being found in possession of cocaine.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–1996)===
In 1995, Nakano also traveled to North Korea, where she was part of the joint New Japan Pro-Wrestling/World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Collision in Korea event in Pyongyang that set a record for attendance at a professional wrestling event with 150,000 spectators. At the event, Nakano and Akira Hokuto defeated Manami Toyota and Mariko Yoshida. Later that year, she competed at WCW&#x27;s World War 3 pay-per-view event, teaming with Akira Hokuto to defeat the team of Cutie Suzuki and Mayumi Ozaki. Nakano—with Sonny Onoo as her manager—continued her feud with Blayze, who was now known as Madusa, at WCW&#x27;s Hog Wild event in August 1996; Madusa defeated Nakano in the match with the stipulation that she was then allowed to destroy Nakano&#x27;s motorcycle. In subsequent years, Madusa called Nakano &quot;a good-hearted person&quot; and an &quot;incredible talent&quot;, with whom she had some of her best matches.

===Retirement===
Due to injuries, Bull Nakano retired from professional wrestling in 1997. On January 8, 2012, Nakano produced her own professional wrestling event, titled &quot;Empress&quot;, which saw her recreate her most famous matches with her old opponents. The event ended with Nakano&#x27;s official retirement ceremony, though she had not been an active wrestler for several years.

===Rise Wrestling (2017)===
It was announced at Rise Wrestling&#x27;s Bellatrix 26/Rise 4 event on September 15, 2017, that Bull Nakano would join the promotion as a facilitator, along with Cheerleader Melissa and Madusa, Nakano&#x27;s former rival. Nakano turned heel during her appearance at Rise 6 on December 1, when she attacked Melissa during her match against Kikyo, and formed a modified version of her heel faction, Gokumon-To; aligning with Kikyo, Dynamite DiDi, and Kris Wolf. Nakano appeared later in the event as a heel manager for Kris Wolf in her match against Shotzi Blackheart (who had Madusa in her corner), and provided interference that led to Wolf defeating Blackheart.

=== Sukeban (2023–present) ===
On September 21, 2023, Bull appeared at the inaugural show for the US based, all-female Japanese pro wrestling promotion Sukeban, where she announced she would be the acting commissioner; she revealed the Sukeban World Championship, and announced the winner of the main event, Ichigo (Unagi) Sayaka, would face Commander (Arisa) Nakajima at the next show—crowning the first champion.

=== WWE return and Hall of Fame (2024) ===
On 5 April 2024, Nakano was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2024. The induction speech was given by Alundra Blayze.

==Professional golf career==
Nakano became a professional golfer in 1998. In November 2004, Nakano played in the Futures Tour Qualifying Tournament in Florida, but ended the tournament in 250th place of 251. The following year, she ended the tournament in 261st place of 271. As a result, she failed to qualify for the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA). Nakano later qualified for the LPGA and joined the Duramed Futures Tour in January 2006.

<text>Cheli is a Spanish-language juvenile sociolect or jargon diatopically restricted to the Madrid area, developed in the 1970s, primarily associated to the post-Francoist counterculture. It drew influence from the hampa and drug-dealing jargons, and it has been noted for Spanishizing Caló and English words as well as rescuing archaic Spanish-language words. Some popular Cheli words (such as &quot;privar&quot;, &quot;molar&quot; or &quot;vasca&quot;) were actually recorded already in the early 20th century in dictionaries of argot, even if frequently with different meanings.

Other phenomena related to the sociolect include the distortion of words, modified with &quot;-ata&quot;, -&quot;eras, -ota&quot; and &quot;-eta&quot; suffixes. While as a non-technical jargon, many, if not most, of its words have fallen into disuse as the language evolves, some of them have proven resilient enough to remain in the spoken language at the expense of more recent words.

Being a fundamentally oral jargon, there are at least two adaptations in cheli literature. In 1994, the chaplain of the now defunct Carabanchel prison, Antonio Alonso, published ‘El Chuchi, los colegas y la basca’ (Editorial CCS, Madrid), an adaptation of the New Gospel. In 2022, ‘El chaval principeras’ (Libros desde Tuma, Madrid), the full translation by journalist Álvaro de Benito of The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, was published. In addition, there are numerous written records in alternative publications, pamphlets and graffiti, especially during the prolific period of publishing in La Movida. Since the use of chat rooms and internet forums has become common among young people&#x27;s communication, cheli has also been revitalised through the use of more or less original lexis.

<doc id="1087958" wikidata="Q2742065" url="?curid=1087958" title="For Everyman">
<text>For Everyman is the second album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1973 (see 1973 in music). The album peaked at number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the single &quot;Redneck Friend&quot; reached number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In 2012, the album was ranked number 450 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==History==
&quot;For Everyman&quot; marked the debut of multi-instrumentalist David Lindley&#x27;s long association with Browne. Guest artists included David Crosby (harmony on the title track), Glenn Frey (harmony on &quot;Redneck Friend&quot;), Elton John (credited as Rockaday Johnnie, piano on &quot;Redneck Friend&quot;), Don Henley (harmony on &quot;Colors of the Sun&quot;), Joni Mitchell, and Bonnie Raitt.

The title track was written by Browne in response to the apocalyptic &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;, a song written by Crosby, Stephen Stills and Paul Kantner. His own version of &quot;These Days&quot; appears here after having been previously recorded by Nico, Tom Rush, who also covered &quot;Colors of the Sun&quot;, and Gregg Allman. Nico was the first to record the song in 1967. Browne later commented &quot;When [Allman] did [These Days] I thought that he really unlocked a power in that song that I sort of then emulated in my version. I started playing the piano. I wasn&#x27;t trying to sing it like Gregg; I couldn&#x27;t possibly. I took the cue, playin&#x27; this slow walk. But it was written very sort of, kind of a little more flatpicking.&quot; &quot;Take It Easy&quot; was written by Browne and Frey and became the Eagles&#x27; first single, released on May 1, 1972.

&quot;For Everyman&quot; was certified as a Gold record in 1975 and Platinum in 1989 by the RIAA.

The album cover photograph is a depiction of Browne&#x27;s childhood home in Highland Park, California, &quot;The Abbey San Encino” which was hand-built by his grandfather Clyde Browne and owned to this day by his brother Edward. The photograph was taken by Alan F. Blumenthal. The cover of the original release was a cutout with the inner sleeve showing Browne sitting in a rocking chair. When removed the picture on the inside had the same background but Browne and the rocking chair were omitted.

==Reception==

In her November 1973 review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote that &quot;for inwardly panoramic songwriting of an apocalyptic bent, Jackson Browne&#x27;s second album is rivaled only by his first (the second one wins), and Jackson himself is rivaled by nobody,&quot; adding that &quot;his work is a unique fusion of West Coast casualness and East Coast paranoia, easygoing slang and painstaking precision, child&#x27;s-eye romanticizing and adult&#x27;s-eye acceptance.&quot; Mostly complimentary throughout, she noted that his singing had improved since the first album, and consciously reviews the album by placing it squarely within the context of the times: &quot;Jackson&#x27;s concerns, even more than his genius for rendering them simultaneously intimate and universal, are the basis for the album&#x27;s unique strengths. He stands alone as a composite of ambivalence about maturity, weariness of the race, fear that love may not be enough ... confusion over whether or not a lasting home can be found in a progressively nightmarish world. He also stands alone as someone who, resigned to all that, is still willing to seek out some quiet way of weathering his time&#x27;s new trials. Brilliantly conceived, incomparably immediate, &quot;For Everyman&quot; truly earns its title.&quot;
Acknowledging that Browne had a large task ahead of him in following his debut &quot;Jackson Browne&quot; in his review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann claimed Browne &quot;turned to some of his secondary older material, which was still better than most people&#x27;s best and, ironically, more accessible...&quot; and summarized the album as a &quot;less consistent collection than Browne&#x27;s debut album. But Browne&#x27;s songwriting ability remained impressive.&quot;

In a 1999 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Anthony DeCurtis claimed the album as uneven and that &quot;Browne is still searching for his true voice on For Everyman. Is he the genial rogue of &#x27;Red Neck Friend&#x27; or the mystical dreamer of &#x27;Our Lady of the Well&#x27;? He will find that voice the following year on his masterpiece, &quot;Late for the Sky&quot;. But on For Everyman, he was testing his various talents with obvious joy, because, like his audience, he was just discovering them.&quot;

Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B grade, writing &quot;Even as he lists toward the pretentious and the vague, the reflective evenness of Browne&#x27;s delivery sets up an expectation of cogency that on this album is satisfied only by such relatively unambitious songs as &#x27;These Days,&#x27; &#x27;Red Neck Friend,&#x27; and the charming &#x27;Ready or Not.&#x27; Which save it for me.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called &quot;Ready or Not&quot; a &quot;catchy autobiographical sketch of life on the road&quot; whose &quot;story line is an intriguing romance with humorous overtones&quot; and said the song had &quot;excellent balance and instrumentation.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;nifty self-produced number that features good country-tinged instrumental work behind [Browns&#x27;s] ear-catching vocalizing&quot; and that &quot;straightforward lyrics follow a solid melody line.&quot;

<doc id="1087961" wikidata="Q1710075" url="?curid=1087961" title="RMS Niagara">
<text>RMS &quot;Niagara&quot; was a transpacific steam ocean liner, Royal Mail Ship and refrigerated cargo ship. She was launched in 1912 in Scotland and sunk in 1940 by a mine off the coast of New Zealand.

Her regular route was between Sydney and Vancouver via Auckland, Suva and Honolulu. In her 27-year career she made 162 round trips between Australia, New Zealand and Canada and sailed nearly .

&quot;Niagara&quot; was owned firstly by the Union Company, and later by the Canadian-Australasian Line, which was jointly owned by the Union Company and Canadian Pacific. Like many Union Company ships, she was registered in London in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Niagara&quot; was built to burn either coal or oil. She was the first oil-burning steamship to be certified by the Board of Trade to carry passengers. When new, &quot;Niagara&quot; was the largest merchant ship yet owned by a New Zealand company. In 1914 and 1915 she set a number of speed records for crossing the Tasman Sea.

In 1918 &quot;Niagara&quot; was instrumental in the spread of Spanish flu to New Zealand. When she was sunk in 1940, &quot;Niagara&quot; was carrying about 8 tons of gold bars. Divers recovered 555 bars in 1941, and another 30 in 1953, but five gold bars remain unaccounted for.

&quot;Niagara&quot; was bunkered with oil when she sank. Heavy fuel oil has leaked from her bunker tanks ever since, and has caused some environmental damage in and around Hauraki Gulf. Some oil remains in her wreck, and the scale of environmental threat it may pose continues to be debated.

==Building==
John Brown &amp; Company built &quot;Niagara&quot; in Clydebank, Glasgow. Laura Borden, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden, launched her on 17 August 1912. &quot;Niagara&quot; was completed in March 1913. She was long, her beam was and her tonnages were and .

Some of &quot;Niagara&quot;″s holds were refrigerated for perishable cargo. When she was new, her number one (forward) hold was not refrigerated.

When new, &quot;Niagara&quot; was the largest ship in the Union Company&#x27;s fleet and the largest ship owned by a New Zealand company.

Before she was launched, &quot;Niagara&quot; was nicknamed &quot;The &quot;Titanic&quot; of the Pacific&quot;. After the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank in April 1912 this was changed to &quot;The Queen of the Pacific&quot;.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Niagara&quot; had three screws. Her port and starboard screws were each driven by a four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine. Exhaust steam from the low-pressure cylinder of each of these engines powered a Parsons low-pressure steam turbine that drove her middle screw.

The combination of three screws, two piston engines and one low-pressure turbine had been pioneered in the New Zealand Shipping Company&#x27;s refrigerated cargo liner , launched in 1908. The same company then ordered a passenger liner with a similar combination, , which was launched in 1910. The giant s and several other passenger liners had also been built with similar &quot;combination machinery&quot;. It offered better fuel economy and speed than propulsion purely by piston engines, and more flexibility than pure turbine propulsion.
&quot;Niagara&quot; had two double-ended and six single-ended boilers, heated by a total of 40 corrugated furnaces. The boilers supplied steam at 220 lbf/in2 to the high-pressure cylinders of her triple-expansion engines. She was equipped to burn either coal or oil. On her maiden voyage she burnt coal.

&quot;Niagara&quot; was the first oil-burning steamship to be certificated by the Board of Trade to carry passengers. Oil was both a more efficient fuel and could be bunkered more quickly. In 1913 it could take a week to bunker a large liner with enough coal to get from Sydney to Vancouver, and she would need to be bunkered again in Vancouver to make the return voyage. &quot;Niagara&quot;″s fuel tanks had capacity for 5,000 tons of oil, and she could bunker enough oil in 30 hours to make a round trip from Sydney to Vancouver and back. This was a valuable saving in both time and harbour dues.

===Accommodation===

&quot;Niagara&quot; was built with berths for 281 first class, 210 second class and 176 third class passengers. Her first class accommodation was amidships, spread over her main, upper, shelter and promenade decks and included two cabins de luxe, each with its own bathroom. Her second class accommodation was aft, and third class accommodation was in the forward part of the ship.

Much of &quot;Niagara&quot;″s interior décor was in historicist styles. One of her first class cabins de luxe was in Louis XIV style. Her other cabin de luxe and her first class music room were in Adam style. Her first class dining saloon, lounge and library, and second-class music and smoking rooms were all in Louis XVI style. Her second class dining saloon was in Georgian style. The ceilings of the first class dining saloon and smoking room each had a domed skylight. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in Sydney called &quot;Niagara&quot; &quot;a magnificent liner&quot;.

&quot;Niagara&quot; had her own hospital. Mindful of the great loss of life on the &quot;Titanic&quot; in April 1912, the Union Company stressed that &quot;Niagara&quot; had enough lifeboats for all her passengers and crew. She also carried a steam launch.

==Sister ship==

At the end of 1913 the Union Company ordered a running mate for &quot;Niagara&quot; from the Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company in Govan, Glasgow. She was to be a sister ship, but longer and a greater tonnage (15300 grt). Unlike &quot;Niagara&quot;, the new ship was propelled entirely by turbines, and had only two screws. She was launched on 30 June 1915 as &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, the Māori name for North Island.

The Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Aotearoa&quot; and renamed her . She was completed on 14 December 1915 as an armed merchant cruiser. U-boat U.69 sank her with a torpedo on 14 June 1917 at 61°01&#x27;48&quot;N 3°34&#x27;12&quot;W, between the Faeroes and Shetlands.

==Entry into service==

The Union Company was based in New Zealand but it registered its ships in London. Many members of her crew were Australian, and they were employed under Australian articles.

&quot;Niagara&quot; was built for the Union Company&#x27;s transpacific service between Australia and Vancouver via New Zealand, Fiji and Hawaii. It was informally called the All-Red Line, like the telegraph cable network of the same name.

However, her maiden voyage was to deliver her from Scotland to Australia. She sailed from Glasgow via Plymouth, Durban and Melbourne to Sydney. She reached Melbourne on 22 April 1913 and Sydney on 24 April.

When &quot;Niagara&quot; reached Melbourne the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; called her &quot;an unsinkable ship&quot; and praised her as &quot;one of the most palatial and up-to-date steamers seen in Australia&quot;. When she reached Auckland a fortnight later, the &quot;Auckland Star&quot; said her arrival marked &quot;a new epoch in the growth of New Zealand&#x27;s trans-oceanic trade&quot;. Stressing her large cargo capacity, the newspaper said &quot;She cannot fail to encourage trade between New Zealand and Canada&quot;, and that she would &quot;inevitably aid the great work of consolidating the Empire&quot;.

&quot;Niagara&quot; was scheduled to leave Sydney on 5 May on her first voyage to Vancouver. She returned from Vancouver and reached Auckland on 1 July 1913, having covered the at an average of .

==Setting records==

In January 1914 &quot;Niagara&quot; set a record for crossing the Tasman Sea. Despite a strong northeast wind on the first day she steamed from Sydney to Auckland in three days and two and a half hours, which broke the previous record by four hours. Her Master, Captain Morrisby, stated that she had maintained a speed of about and must at times have reached . In July 1914 &quot;Niagara&quot; broke her own record with a crossing from Sydney to Auckland of three days and half an hour.

In May 1915 &quot;Niagara&quot; set a new westbound record across the Tasman Sea by steaming from Auckland to Sydney in three days and 23 minutes. This record stood until 1931.

As well as breaking Australasian speed records, &quot;Niagara&quot; gained a reputation for reliability, and for stability in all weathers.

==World War I==
On 28 July 1914 World War I began. On 15 August &quot;Niagara&quot; and another Union Company liner, , were held for some days at Honolulu because the German cruiser was reported to be near the coast of British Columbia. During the war &quot;Niagara&quot; sailed blacked out, and she varied her course and speed in response to reported sightings of German warships.

In March 1915, en route from Sydney to Auckland, &quot;Niagara&quot; lost one blade from her middle screw. This unbalanced the screw, which damaged both her middle propeller shaft and its bearing. Her engineers shut down her turbine and she reached Auckland on 22 March at using only her port and starboard screws driven by her triple-expansion engines.
&quot;Niagara&quot; carried a spare propeller shaft and screw. She was dry docked in Calliope Dock, where her damaged propeller shaft and screw were removed and replacements installed. Engineers worked around the clock and completed the repair in 40 hours, enabling &quot;Niagara&quot; to leave the dock on 26 March and return to service. At the time &quot;Niagara&quot; was the largest ship to have been dry docked in New Zealand. She fitted into Calliope Dock with just clearance fore and aft and on either side.

In May 1915 wartime security aboard &quot;Niagara&quot; was tightened. Police, customs and military authorities in Sydney thoroughly searched the ship, and searched all baggage and questioning all crew and passengers before allowing them aboard. Security in Auckland was also tightened.

By December 1915 there was a shortage of merchant seafarers in Sydney, and ships including &quot;Niagara&quot; had difficulty finding enough to make a full complement. But there was a particular shortage of stokers and trimmers, which affected &quot;Niagara&quot; less because she normally burned oil instead of coal.

In March 1918 it was reported that at some time in the war the German auxiliary cruiser twice came close to intercepting &quot;Niagara&quot;. The report did not say when either incident took place. Later it was claimed that &quot;Wolf&quot;″s seaplane once sighted &quot;Niagara&quot;, but the liner outran &quot;Wolf&quot;. &quot;Wolf&quot; also evaded capture, and returned to Germany in February 1918.

==Spanish flu==

In October 1918, Spanish flu broke out aboard &quot;Niagara&quot; on a voyage from Vancouver to Auckland. She had left Vancouver on 21 September, and reached Honolulu ten days later. The next day she left Honolulu, and thereafter her stewards began to fall ill. She reached Suva four days after leaving Honolulu, on about 5 October. By then there were about 50 or 60 cases. Her ship&#x27;s doctor, Dr Latchmore, fell ill, and two passengers, Drs Mackenzie and Barnett, took over.

After &quot;Niagara&quot; left Suva, passengers and members of the crew also began to fall ill. So many people were infected that women passengers were recruited as volunteer stewards. &quot;Niagara&quot;″s hospital had only about 10 beds. Dr Mackenzie later testified that the outbreak was &quot;in practically every portion of the ship&quot; and little was done to isolate the sick. He also stated that her crew&#x27;s quarters were &quot;very crowded&quot; and &quot;Their condition was very miserable when we had so many sick men in the tropical heat&quot;.

On 11 October one patient aboard &quot;Niagara&quot; died of bronchial pneumonia. By then more than 100 of her crew were infected, and 25 cases were described as needing transfer to hospital. But Dr Mackenzie considered that the outbreak was &quot;ordinary influenza&quot;. One case was complicated by pneumonia, but Mackenzie attributed it to the fact that that patient had suffered a poison gas attack in the war.
On 12 October the Minister of Health, George Warren Russell, told the Governor-General of New Zealand, the Earl of Liverpool, that Spanish flu was not a notifiable disease, and therefore he could not quarantine &quot;Niagara&quot; unless the Governor-General were to issue a proclamation to that effect. Later that day &quot;Niagara&quot; docked in Auckland. The Port Health Officer, Dr CC Russell, went aboard and examined the patients. Dr Russell agreed with Mackenzie that all the influenza cases were &quot;simple influenza&quot;. Dr Russell examined the pneumonia patient and concluded that the complication was not caused by Spanish flu.

On 12 October, Dr Hughes, Auckland&#x27;s District Health Officer, sent GW Russell a telegram informing him that one influenza patient aboard &quot;Niagara&quot; had died of pneumonia. GW Russell replied telling him to give clearance for people to disambark from the ship.
After &quot;Niagara&quot; docked, 28 patients were transferred from her to Auckland City Hospital and 10 were kept aboard ship to be treated. 10 contracted pneumonia, which often followed Spanish flu. &quot;Niagara&quot;″s second class smoking room and second class cabins were converted into temporary hospitals.

Between 13 and 21 October nine more cases were transferred from &quot;Niagara&quot; to the hospital. Two patients died after being transferred to the hospital. Another died aboard &quot;Niagara&quot; the day before she left Auckland. 160 of Auckland Hospital&#x27;s 180 nurses became infected, and two died.

When &quot;Niagara&quot; reached Sydney, 296 passengers and about 200 crew were detained for seven days at North Head Quarantine Station. About 280 of the passengers were released from quarantine on 1 November.

Among the passengers who disembarked from &quot;Niagara&quot; at Auckland were the then New Zealand Prime Minister, William Massey, and his Minister of Finance, Joseph Ward. A newspaper alleged that the reason why GW Russell failed to quarantine the ship was in order to avoid inconveniencing the two statesmen.

In November 1918 Opposition MPs in the New Zealand House of Representatives criticised the Government&#x27;s handling of the Spanish flu epidemic. Peter Fraser questioned GW Russell&#x27;s response to the outbreak aboard &quot;Niagara&quot;, and Harry Holland called for a Royal Commission of inquiry.

On 25 January 1919 &quot;Niagara&quot; was quarantined at Auckland on arrival from Sydney. She had one patient with bronchial influenza, who was transferred to the quarantine station on Motuihe Island.

===Influenza Epidemic Commission===
In 1919 the Governor-General of New Zealand appointed an Influenza Epidemic Commission. Its terms of reference included &quot;All matters connected with the arrival in New Zealand waters of the SS &#x27;Niagara&#x27; and SS &#x27;Makura&#x27; in respect to their bearing on the introduction and extension of the epidemic&quot;. The &quot;Makura&quot; was another Union Company ship, and at the time was &quot;Niagara&quot;″s running mate on the All-Red Line. &quot;Makura&quot;, unlike &quot;Niagara&quot;, was quarantined. Three of her patients died.

Witnesses who testified to the Commission included Drs Hughes, Mackenzie and Russell, Dr Maguire, Medical Superintendent of Auckland Hospital, and Dr Milsom of the Auckland Branch of the New Zealand Division of the British Medical Association. Dr Maguire stated that the hospital had admitted no cases of influenza &quot;for some months&quot; before &quot;Niagara&quot; arrived. Dr Milson told the Commission that the BMA&#x27;s opinion was that &quot;&quot;Niagara&quot; was the cause of the epidemic&quot; in New Zealand.

However, before &quot;Niagara&quot; arrived there had been an outbreak near Auckland in the military camp at Narrow Neck. The first cases were recorded on 30 September. One doctor from the camp stated that on 10 October there were 169 cases, 39 were severe and three were pneumonic. Another stated there were 230 by 12 October. There was then a lull until 19 October, when cases at Narrow Neck increased again. About half of the cases at Narrow Neck that were diagnosed after 19 October were pneumonic, and from 20 October there were deaths.

On 13 May 1919 the Commission published an interim report. It found, inter alia:

&quot;That, although the latter is not one capable of absolute demonstration, the evidence before is raises a very strong presumption that a substantial factor in the introduction of the epidemic was the arrival in Auckland on the 12th October of the s.s. &quot;Niagara&quot; with patients infected with the epidemic disease.&quot;
The report exonerated Massey and Ward from interfering with the decision not to quarantine the ship, but it criticised Dr Russell for accepting Dr Mackenzie&#x27;s diagnoses of &quot;simple influenza&quot;, and GW Russell for not quarantining &quot;Niagara&quot; when the outbreak aboard her &quot;made her a menace to the health of the city&quot; (of Auckland).

The Commission was given evidence that the condition of crew accommodation on a number of ships was unhealthy. WT Young, General Secretary of the Seamen&#x27;s Union of Australia, raised this with the Union Company, and the Commission reported that &quot;we were assured that considerable improvements were being effected in that company&#x27;s vessels&quot;. However, the report suggested that the powers and duties of port health officers did not go far enough, and it called for &quot;a regular procedure of constant supervision over the sanitary and hygienic conditions of the wharves and shipping&quot;.

==&quot;Aorangi&quot;==

In 1920 the Union Company revived its plan for a new liner to share the All-Red Line with &quot;Niagara&quot;. That June it announced that the new ship would be propelled by reduction-geared turbines like HMS &quot;Avenger&quot;, and capable of like &quot;Niagara&quot;. But the new ship would be considerably larger: and more than long. But in the 1920s marine diesel engines advanced rapidly in size and power. This led the Union Company to change its plans and order a motor ship.

 was launched in 1924 in Scotland and reached Sydney on 3 March 1925. At she supplanted &quot;Niagara&quot; as the largest ship in the Union Company fleet. Between them &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Aorangi&quot; were scheduled to provide a regular service with timetabled departures from Sydney and Vancouver every four weeks.

==Incidents and rescues==
in February 1923 a cyclone struck &quot;Niagara&quot; in passage from Suva to Auckland. An Australian able seaman who had been working on her boat deck, William Kew, was swept overboard, and at least one passenger was injured. &quot;Niagara&quot; turned back and searched two hours for A/b Kew, but did not find him. The cyclone forced &quot;Niagara&quot; to heave to for a few hours, and she made only very slow progress for another 24.

===&quot;Doris Crane&quot;===
On the morning of 19 December 1927 the three-masted schooner &quot;Doris Crane&quot; was sailing from Fanning Island to San Francisco with a cargo of copra when fuel for her auxiliary diesel engine caught fire. Her crew fought the fire, but it spread and her engineer died of burns. At 1530 hrs on 20 December the crew abandoned ship in two lifeboats about north of Hawaii.

&quot;Doris Crane&quot; had no wireless, but at 0400 hrs on 20 December &quot;Niagara&quot;″s lookouts saw the glare of the fire from away and she changed course to assist. By the time &quot;Niagara&quot; arrived, the lifeboats had drifted away from the burning schooner. After three hours&#x27; search &quot;Niagara&quot; found the two boats. She landed five of the survivors at Honolulu on 22 December and the remaining nine at Suva.

===&quot;Ika&quot;===
On 26 February 1928 the fishing launch &quot;Ika&quot; suffered engine failure between Tiri Tiri Island and The Noises in the Hauraki Gulf. Her crew tried to reach Kawau Island by sail power, but her sail was blown away. A heavy sea strained her hull and her crew were bailing constantly. She drifted for two days and nights, by which time she was half-full of water.

At about 1955 hrs on 28 February the crew sighted &quot;Niagara&quot;, which had just left Auckland for Sydney. The fishermen lit benzene flares, which were seen by &quot;Niagara&quot;″s Second Officer. &quot;Niagara&quot; changed course and rescued the three fishermen with one of her lifeboats about off Hen and Chicken Islands. &quot;Ika&quot; had drifted about , and a southwesterly wind was driving her farther off-shore when &quot;Niagara&quot; reached her.

===Vancouver wharf===
On 30 January 1931 &quot;Niagara&quot; collided with a concrete wharf in fog as she came into berth at Vancouver. Eight steel plates of her bow were damaged. Repairs were estimated to cost £1,500, and were completed in time for her to begin her return voyage on schedule. After she reached Sydney, &quot;Niagara&quot; was dry docked at Cockatoo Island on 2 March for further repairs.

===&quot;King Egbert&quot;===
On the evening of 17 July 1935 the cargo motor ship &quot;King Egbert&quot; collided with &quot;Niagara&quot; in fog in the Strait of Juan de Fuca about off Victoria. &quot;Niagara&quot; had just left Vancouver, and her passengers included the Prime Minister of Australia, Joseph Lyons.

Both ships returned to port for survey. &quot;King Egbert&quot;″s bow was stove in, and &quot;Niagara&quot;″s hull was damaged above the waterline on her port side forward, abreast of her number one hold. The Wreck Commissioner took evidence from the Masters of both ships and found that neither was to blame. &quot;Niagara&quot; was dry docked at Esquimalt for repairs. She returned to service on 1 August and reached Auckland on 19 August.

===Firework explosion===
On 27 October 1937 &quot;Niagara&quot; was at a wharf in Darling Harbour having 300 cases of fireworks loaded into her number two hold when one of the cases exploded. Dock workers were blown through the air, five were injured, one later died of his injuries and three others were treated in hospital. Windows were broken more than 200 yards away.

The fireworks had been made in China, arrived on the steamship &quot;Nankin&quot; and were being transhipped at Sydney for export to Fiji. They were of a type that can be detonated by shock, and which were banned in New South Wales. The remaining cases of fireworks were removed to Bantry Bay Explosives Depot.

==Wireless developments==
When &quot;Niagara&quot; entered service she was equipped for wireless telegraphy on the 300 and 600 metre wavelengths. Her original call sign was GBE.

In 1925 the Amalgamated Wireless Company built a new, powerful shortwave beam wireless transmitter for her that was installed when she was overhauled in Sydney from February to April 1925. That April and May, &quot;Niagara&quot; set new wireless records by transmitting and receiving signals to and from both Australia and Canada throughout her voyage to Vancouver and back. While moored in Vancouver she sent a signal to Pennant Hills, and on her return voyage from Vancouver she succeeded in transmitting wireless signals from the Pacific Ocean to England. This was a new record for the Marconi Company, achieved with a transmitter power of less than one Kilowatt.

In January 1928, as &quot;Niagara&quot; crossed the Tasman Sea, she exchanged signals with a wireless station in Burnham-on-Sea in England. In 1925 &quot;Niagara&quot; had succeeded in transmitting to England from somewhere in the Pacific, but this latest achievement was claimed as a new record. A service was established by which passengers could send messages to England at a cost of 11 pence per word.
Between 28 May and 9 June 1928 the Fokker F.VII aircraft &quot;Southern Cross&quot; made the World&#x27;s first flight across the Pacific: from California via Fiji and Hawaii to Queensland. Its crew maintained hourly wireless contact with &quot;Niagara&quot; on each leg of the flight.

In 1934 the new wireless call sign GNXP superseded &quot;Niagara&quot;″s code letters JBSG and her original wireless call sign.

In February 1936 the New Zealand Marine Department established a wireless direction finding beacon on Tiri Tiri Island, and asked ships to help to test it. &quot;Niagara&quot;″s master recommended that a second beacon was needed for ships to fix their position by triangulation. However, the beacon on Tiri Tiri enabled ships to get accurate bearings from a range of up to .

==Modifications==
By October 1928 refrigerating equipment had been installed in &quot;Niagara&quot;″s number one hold. This increased her refrigerated capacity by 450 tons, bringing the total to .

In August 1929 &quot;Niagara&quot; received a month-long overhaul in Sydney. The domed skylight in her first class dining saloon was removed in order to increase the deck area of the first class lounge, which was immediately above the saloon. Her passenger accommodation was re-painted, re-decorated, re-carpeted, much of her furniture was replaced and the remainder was re-upholstered.

In 1933 first &quot;Aorangi&quot; and then &quot;Niagara&quot; were given their biennial overhauls in Sydney. The Union Company&#x27;s was to deputise for each ship in turn. &quot;Niagara&quot; was withdrawn from service when she reached Sydney on 14 August. Large sections of her deck were re-laid, and equipment to screen sound films aboard was installed in one of her lounges. &quot;Niagara&quot; returned to service at Sydney on 12 October as scheduled. The combined cost of overhauling the two ships was £60,000.

==Canadian–Australasian Line==
In 1930 &quot;Niagara&quot; made her hundredth round trip between Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
In 1931 the Union Company anticipated competition from Matson Line of the USA, which had ordered two new liners, and , to run between the West Coast of the United States and Australia via Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand. They would be swifter than &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Aorangi&quot;, and the Federal government of the United States subsidised US ships US$10 per mile to carry mail, which gave them a competitive advantage over UK and Empire ships. In response the Union Company and Canadian Pacific created a new jointly-owned subsidiary, Canadian-Australasian Line, to which the Union Company transferred &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Aorangi&quot;.
In June 1936 the UK government commissioned an Imperial Shipping Committee to examine merchant shipping in the Pacific, including problems caused by subsidised US competition. Canadian Pacific&#x27;s Chairman, Sir Edward Beatty, sought support from the governments of the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji to improve Canadian-Australasian&#x27;s trans-pacific service. He proposed a pair of , liners at a cost of £2.5 million if the governments would subsidise the service. P&amp;O, which owned the Union Company, supported the proposal. The Imperial Shipping Committee recognised the problem but proposed no solution.

In May and June 1937 an Imperial Conference considered matters including shipping, which faced increasing Japanese competition as well as subsidised competition from US ships. Beatty reiterated his proposal for new liners to replace &quot;Niagara&quot; and &quot;Aorangi&quot;. Hopes were raised but no agreement was reached.

In 1938 &quot;Niagara&quot; celebrated 25 years in service. By then she had completed about 150 round trips between Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
In July 1939 Sir Edward Beatty stated that the cost of shipbuilding had now risen too high for new ships to be ordered for the transpacific route. Instead there was a proposal that the Canadian Pacific liner , or one of her sister ships, could be modified for trans-pacific service to replace &quot;Niagara&quot;.

On 1 September 1939 World War II began. That October Canadian-Australasian Line introduced a 33 per cent war surcharge on passenger fares. In January 1940 this was reduced to 15 per cent to encourage travel between Australia and New Zealand.

==Loss==
On the night of 13–14 June 1940 the laid a field of 228 contact mines across the mouth of the Hauraki Gulf: in a bid to blockade Auckland, New Zealand&#x27;s largest commercial port. For the next four days ships passed in and out of Auckland without hitting any of the mines.
On the night of 18–19 June &quot;Niagara&quot; left Auckland. She was carrying passengers including RAAF Air Vice Marshal Stanley Goble, who with his wife was en route to Canada to be air liaison officer in Ottawa. Her cargo included half of New Zealand&#x27;s entire stock of small arms ammunition. It was being sent via Canada to mitigate a shortage in the Dunkirk evacuation. In her strong room she was secretly carrying 590 gold bars from South Africa, valued at £2,500,000. They were a payment from the United Kingdom to the then-neutral United States for munitions.

At 0340 hrs on 19 June &quot;Niagara&quot;″s bow struck one of &quot;Orion&quot;″s mines off Bream Head. The explosion blew the hatch cover and stanchions off her forward hold. The cover was blown into the sea, complete with a motor car that had been secured to it as deck cargo.

&quot;Niagara&quot; fired distress flares, her wireless operator transmitted a distress message and her crew launched her 18 lifeboats. Everyone aboard successfully abandoned ship in 90 minutes, without loss of life, and with only a few minor injuries. Sources disagree on the number of people involved. They are variously cited as 202 or 203 crew, and 136, 146 or 148 passengers. The evacuation was helped by her electric lighting continuing to function.

&quot;Niagara&quot;″s stern rose clear of the water before she sank by her bow at 0532 hrs in of water between the Mokohinau Islands and Hen and Chicken Islands. Her sinking ended a 27-year career in which &quot;Niagara&quot; made 162 round trips between Australia, New Zealand and Canada and sailed nearly .

At dawn the lifeboats were scattered over an area of about . Shortly after 0800 hrs the cruiser sighted them. An aircraft circled them, then at 1030 hrs a fast motor launch arrived whose crew told the lifeboat crews in which direction to steer. The lifeboats proceeded under sail until their occupants were rescued by &quot;a large liner in the vicinity&quot; that was diverted to the scene. Under conditions of wartime secrecy, news reports at the time did not disclose that it was Huddart Parker&#x27;s Trans-Tasman liner . The Northern Steamship Company coaster &quot;Kapiti&quot; and a number of launches transferred survivors from the lifeboats to &quot;Wanganella&quot;.

&quot;Niagara&quot;″s only apparent fatality was her ship&#x27;s cat, a five-year-old grey and white long-haired tom called Aussie. His mother had been &quot;Niagara&quot;″s cat before him, his father was a Persian in Vancouver and Aussie was born at Suva. Aussie was put in one of the lifeboats when &quot;Niagara&quot; was being abandoned, but he jumped back aboard ship. A few days later, residents of Horahora, Whangarei claimed that a cat answering Aussie&#x27;s description came ashore on a piece of driftwood, and that one of them had taken him in, but the cat escaped and had not been seen since.

==Gold salvage==
The UK government urgently needed the gold to be salvaged from the wreck. This had been done before. In 1917 two German mines had sunk the armed merchant cruiser off the coast of Ireland. She was carrying 3,211 gold bars, most of which were salvaged by Royal Navy divers between 1917 and 1924. The amount was more than 43 tons: five times as much as &quot;Niagara&quot; was carrying.

Nor was the depth unprecedented. in 1932 an Italian salvage contractor had recovered sovereigns and silver bullion worth £1 million from the wreck of the P&amp;O liner in the English Channel. &quot;Egypt&quot; lay at a depth of , which was even deeper than &quot;Niagara&quot;.

However, the depth at which &quot;Niagara&quot; lay was a great challenge, and it was in a minefield. Minesweepers disposed of three mines after &quot;Niagara&quot; was sunk, but no-one on the Allied side of the war knew how many &quot;Orion&quot; had laid.

===1941===
The Royal Australian Navy dismissed the idea of trying to salvage the gold. But the Bank of England offered a fee of £27,000 plus 2.5 per cent of the value of any gold recovered. A syndicate from Melbourne, Australia accepted the offer. Captain JP Williams, Captain J Herd and chief diver John Edwards Johnstone led the syndicate, which was called either the United Salvage Syndicate or United Salvage Proprietary Ltd.

An engineer from Melbourne, David Isaacs, designed a diving chamber for the salvagers. A company in Castlemaine variously referred to as Thompson&#x27;s Engineering and Pipe Co or Thompson&#x27;s Foundry made the chamber in conditions of strict wartime secrecy. It is made of manganese bronze, has several small quartz glass portholes, is built to withstand pressure to a depth of and weighs three tonnes. It is cylindrical, with a bulbous top, and just big enough for one man to stand inside.

The salvagers obtained the use of &quot;Claymore&quot;, a Northern Steamship Company coaster that had been built in 1902 and was now rusting in Auckland harbour. Her steam engine was unreliable, one of her propeller blades was missing and her hull constantly needed patching, but she seems to have been the only ship available.

&quot;Claymore&quot; was fitted out with the chamber and a grab to convert her into a salvage ship. The salvagers based themselves at Whangārei and began operations on 15 December 1940. &quot;Claymore&quot; searched for the wreck by dragging her anchor across the seabed. Twice she fouled mines that &quot;Orion&quot; had planted, and was fortunate not to be sunk. Once the diving chamber became fouled with the anchor wire of one of the mines. On 2 February 1941 &quot;Claymore&quot; found &quot;Niagara&quot;.

&quot;Niagara&quot; lies on her port side. The salvagers used explosives to try to blast open her hull, but with little success. Salvagers then used the grab to open the wreck bit by bit. One diver was lowered in the diving chamber to observe the grab, and passed instructions by telephone up to the grab operator aboard &quot;Claymore&quot;. The divers were John Johnstone and his brother William, who between them made 316 descents to the wreck. Eventually the operation exposed &quot;Niagara&quot;″s strong room.

In October 1941 the salvage crew used explosives to open the strong room door. The first two gold bars were recovered on 13 October. By December 1941 they had recovered 555 of the 590 gold bars. The salvage operation was ended on 8 December, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

The diving chamber was later returned to Castlemaine, possibly early in the 1980s. It is now preserved and displayed in the historic Castlemaine Market Building.

===1953===
In 1953 Johnstone returned with a different salvage ship and more modern equipment. &quot;Foremost 17&quot; had been built in 1911 as &quot;Port of London Authority No. 9&quot;, a hopper barge for the Port of London Authority. In 1925 the PLA sold her and her new owner renamed her &quot;Foremost 17&quot;. She passed through several private owners, until in 1940 the Admiralty bought her and had her converted into a salvage ship. In June 1944 she was at Gold Beach where Mulberry Harbour B was built to supply the Allied invasion of Normandy. In 1947 the Admiralty sold her to a British Company, Risdon Beazley, and by about 1952 she was in Australia.

&quot;Foremost 17&quot;, like &quot;Claymore&quot;, was equipped with a diving chamber from which to direct work on the wreck. But instead of a grab, &quot;Foremost 17&quot; had what Johnstone called the &quot;iron man&quot;. This was described as having robotic arms and legs that could walk on the sea bed at depth, picking up heavy objects. It was operated directly from the diving chamber, instead of relying on an observer relaying instructions to an operator on the surface.

&quot;Foremost 17&quot; found &quot;Niagara&quot; on 16 April 1953. By 23 July she had recovered 30 of the 35 remaining gold bars and Johnstone had ended the salvage operation. Five bars remain unaccounted for.

==The wreck since 1953==
A New Zealand law passed in 1979 protects an underwater communications cable that passes near the wreck. This law forbids any vessel anchoring above the wreck without special permission.

In 1988 marine salvage specialist Keith Gordon from Albany, New Zealand explored the wreck with a remotely operated underwater vehicle.

The wreck has become an artificial reef, rich with marine life. Since 1999 scuba divers have visited and explored it. Where the strong room used to be is now a crater littered with débris.

Gordon recovered &quot;Niagara&quot;″s bell in 2007.

===Environment===

&quot;Niagara&quot;″s fuel oil capacity was 5,000 tons. Maritime New Zealand says it does not know how much oil remains in the wreck. News reports from the 2010s variously estimate the amount at 1,000 tonnes, 1,500 tonnes, or 4,200 tons (sic).

Oil has escaped from her wreck ever since she was sunk in 1940. In the 1980s Keith Gordon saw oil escaping from the wreck and forming a slick long. Another escape was photographed in 2000, when marine environmentalist Wade Doak described the wreck as a &quot;ticking timebomb&quot;, threatening Whangārei&#x27;s mangrove systems and the Hen and Chickens Islands nature reserve. In 2015 she was described as &quot;still bleeding oil&quot;.

Maritime NZ says that the remaining oil is in a semi-solid state because of the pressure and low temperature at that depth. But the wreck is deteriorating, and climate change is increasing the sea temperature. A new contingency plan was made in 2016 in case a large amount of oil suddenly escapes.

Environmentalists including Doak, salvage experts, and Auckland politician Mike Lee have called for the oil to be extracted from the wreck to prevent such a disaster. In 2017 Gordon estimated that with modern technology, the oil could be extracted at a cost of about NZ$6 million. In 2018 an art exhibition was held in Mangawhai Heads to raise public awareness of the environmental threat from the wreck.

<text>Katatonia is a Swedish heavy metal band formed in Stockholm in 1991 by Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström. The band started as a studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for the band&#x27;s love of death metal. Increasing popularity led them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band&#x27;s founders, the lineup was a constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including Mikael Åkerfeldt of the band Opeth for a period. After two death/doom albums, &quot;Dance of December Souls&quot; (1993) and &quot;Brave Murder Day&quot; (1996), problems with Renkse&#x27;s vocal cords coupled with new musical influences led the band away from the screamed vocals of death metal to a more traditional, melodic form of heavy metal music.

The band released two more albums, &quot;Discouraged Ones&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Decision&quot; (1999), before settling into a stable quintet lineup for all of the 2000s. The band released four more albums with said lineup: &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot; (2001), &quot;Viva Emptiness&quot; (2003), &quot;The Great Cold Distance&quot; (2006) and &quot;Night Is the New Day&quot; (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their metal sound while adding more progressive rock sounds to their work over time. While lineup changes started up again into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted, and the band continued on to release their ninth and tenth studio albums, &quot;Dead End Kings&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Fall of Hearts&quot; (2016). After touring in support of the album through 2017, the band entered a hiatus at the beginning of 2018. The band returned from their hiatus in February 2019, with their eleventh studio album, &quot;City Burials&quot; (2020), and twelfth studio album, &quot;Sky Void of Stars&quot; (2023).

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1991–1997) ===
The band was first formed in 1991 by Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström as a two-piece studio-based project. Renkse would provide clean and screamed vocals and drums, while Nyström would provide all bass and guitars. Renkse was the primary lyricist, while Nyström was the primary music composer. The duo had been working together with music in some capacity since 1987, but became serious about making music in 1991, when they began work on their first release, the demo &quot;Jhva Elohim Meth... The Revival&quot;. The release, along with the next few subsequent releases by the band, were of the death/doom metal sound, with the members being inspired and influenced by the rise of death metal becoming popular in Europe at the time. The release was enough of a hit in the underground metal scene to garner the attention of a small music label, Vic Records, which re-released it as an EP in 1993, which helped gain more exposure for the duo. The newfound popularity found them recruiting a bass guitarist, Guillaume Le Huche, so the trio could play live performances, and returning to the studio to recreate a debut full-length album. The resulting work, &quot;Dance of December Souls&quot;, was released in late 1993. The album&#x27;s bleak melancholy and despair of their sound continued to give them the classification of death-doom.

After touring in support of the album, the trio recorded an EP, &quot;For Funerals to Come...&quot;, which was released in early 1995. However, Le Huche left the band shortly after, and issues finding a replacement found the band break up for a year, while Renkse and Nystrom worked separately on their own projects. Of note, Renkse started up a new band, October Tide, with guitarist Fredrik Norrman. After working some with Norrman on the project, Renkse decided to revive Katatonia with Norrman as the new third member.

After the year off, the band regrouped in 1996 to record and release a second studio album, &quot;Brave Murder Day&quot;. In addition to Fredrik Norrman contributing guitars to the album, the band also recruited Renkse&#x27;s friend, Mikael Åkerfeldt of the band Opeth, to perform the screamed vocals, as Renkse became unable to do them himself anymore due to medical issues. The release, alongside the EP &quot;Sounds of Decay&quot; released with the same lineup the next year, were considered their last in the genre of doom/death metal, with the band starting to focus more on clean vocals in subsequent releases. To promote the album, the band recruited Mikael Oretoft to play bass and they embarked on their first European tour with progressive metal band In the Woods...

=== Move away from death metal (1998–1999) ===
While Renkse experimented with clean, melodic vocals over metal instrumentation as early as the 1994 recording of the track &quot;Scarlet Heavens&quot; (later released in very limited capacity on Katatonia/Primordial in 1996), the band did not feel ready to pursue that sort of sound at the time. However, after the band&#x27;s 1997 releases, due to a desire to create more emotive and evolving music, the band decided to move in that direction. The first of said releases was an EP entitled &quot;Saw You Drown&quot;, released in early 1997, which also contained the first wide release of &quot;Scarlet Heavens&quot;. Later in 1998, the band released their first full-album of this style, titled &quot;Discouraged Ones&quot;.
After the release, the band signed a multi-album record deal with Peaceville, which would mark the first time the band would work with a bigger label, and stay with them for the long-term. Additionally, Renkse wanted to focus further on dedicating himself to developing his clean vocals, leading him to no longer do any further drumming for the band. The band kept active, recording and releasing their fourth album, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Decision&quot;, in 1999. The sessions were difficult, with the writing alone taking Renkse and Nystrom over seven months to complete. Once recording, they recruited Dan Swanö, who had helped assist the band in the past, as a sessions drummer. While the album contained no screamed vocals, the band still retained Åkerfeldt still assisted with vocal production on the album, as they had with &quot;Discouraged Ones&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Decision&quot;, the band, tired of continually searching for session musicians, finally decided to put together a stable, permanent lineup. Fredrick Norrman recruited his brother, Mattias Norrman, as a bassist and Daniel Liljekvist joined the band as the drummer.

=== Stable lineup and international growth (2000–2009) ===
 With the band finally achieving a stable lineup with Renkse, Nystrom, the Norrman brothers and Liljekvist, the band began work on their fifth album, the first of four albums the quintet would release over the course of the next decade. While personnel issues no longer plagued the band, recording sessions were still difficult, this time due to financial constraints, which limited how much time they could spend in the studio. The band worked on recording the album off and on from April to December 2000, and while the stopping and starting proved to be troublesome, it also kept them re-evaluating and reworking their material in the downtime, something they felt ultimately helped the shaping of the album. The resulting album, &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot; was released in May 2001, and marked the band further distancing itself from traditional heavy metal music, in favor of more of a hard rock sound. The band decided to release the &quot;Teargas&quot; EP shortly prior to the album release, essentially as a single, containing the album track &quot;Teargas&quot; and two B-sides. Another EP of music from the same sessions, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s Music&quot;, was also released shortly after the album. The band rounded out the year with a European tour with Åkerfeldt&#x27;s band Opeth, with Renkse and Nystrom even providing guest vocals at some Opeth shows when Åkerfeldt was experiencing trouble with his vocal cords.

By mid-2002, the band had started to write material for their sixth album, and by October 2002, they had entered the studio to begin formal recording sessions. In April 2003, the band released the resulting album, &quot;Viva Emptiness&quot;. The album was promoted by the release of the single &quot;Ghost of the Sun&quot; and the similarly named &quot;Ghost of the Spring&quot; tour. The tour, which went through Europe with support act Daylight Dies, went as planned, though the band later had to cancel a June performance in Germany due to sickness, and had July festival appearances cancelled due to issues beyond their control with third party organizers. Still, the album was a success, being their first to chart on any official charts, peaking at no. 17 on the Finnish charts. 

The band continued to spend much of 2003 and 2004 touring in support of the album. The band started writing for their seventh studio album as early as October 2004, and spent six months of 2005 in the studio recording the album, while taking breaks for further touring. The band&#x27;s only releases during the time period was two compilation album releases: &quot;Brave Yester Days&quot;, a collection of songs from their death metal era in the mid-1990s, and &quot;The Black Sessions&quot;, a collection of songs from after they moved away from death metal. While initially planning on releasing the album by the end of 2005, recording sessions went late into 2005, pushing its release into 2006. The album, entitled &quot;The Great Cold Distance&quot;, released in March 2006, along with the accompanying singles &quot;My Twin&quot; and &quot;Deliberation&quot;.

The band again turned to touring, most notably their live performance at Summer Breeze Open Air in 2006 being used for the release of a live album titled &quot;Live Consternation&quot; in 2007. Additionally, the band&#x27;s first full North American tour, with Daylight Dies and Moonspell, ran through October and November 2006. The band continued to tour into 2007, focusing on Europe in the first half of the year, and returning to North America, even Mexico, in the latter half of the year.

With focusing on touring in support of &quot;The Great Cold Distance&quot; for most of 2006 and 2007, the band turned their focus to working on a new album in early 2008. By mid-2008, the band had booked studio time twice, but cancelled both times, not satisfied with the material accumulated to record each time. Writer&#x27;s block, largely stemming from the band feeling pressure to release a follow-up that could measure up to &quot;The Great Cold Distance&quot;, was main reason for the slow progress, as the album had been their biggest success, critically and financially, at the time. Renkse and Nystrom also had difficulty deciding in what direction the album&#x27;s sound would move into, eventually deciding to move the band into a more progressive rock sound. Progress continued to be slow, with the band continuing to write into 2009, but not entering the studio until mid-2009. The band continued to tour intermittently as well, including a short tour supporting Porcupine Tree in Europe. After over three and a half years, the band finally released their eighth studio album, in November 2009, under the title &quot;Night Is the New Day&quot;, including the single &quot;Day and Then the Shade&quot; a month prior. The time spent on the album paid off, with it being generally well received by critics. PopMatters deemed the album the second best metal album of 2009.

=== Lineup changes, &quot;Dead End Kings&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hearts&quot; (2010–2017) ===
Shortly after the release of &quot;Night is the New Day&quot;, the band&#x27;s first lineup change in a decade occurred when both Norrman brothers amicably left the band, stating they wanted to focus on life at home rather than further touring cycles abroad. They were replaced by longtime guitar tech Per Eriksson on guitar and Niklas Sandin on bass. In March 2010, the band also released another EP, featuring unreleased and alternate versions of songs from &quot;Night is the New Day&quot;, titled &quot;The Longest Year&quot;, which were later included on the special edition reissue of the album in 2011. The band continued to tour extensively, including Sonisphere Festival in the UK, and another North American tour with Swallow the Sun in 2010, and another North American tour with Opeth on their &quot;Heritage&quot; tour in 2011. The band wrapped up the year with a 20th Anniversary concert in December, with the band playing songs spanning their career, and having past members, including the Norrman brothers and Le Huche, rejoin the band to play on some songs.

The band entered the studio to begin work on their ninth studio album on 30 January 2012. The resulting album, &quot;Dead End Kings&quot; was released in August in Europe and North America. In support of the release, the band co-headlined the &quot;Epic Kings Idols Tour&quot; with The Devin Townsend Project, in North America in September, followed by the &quot;Dead Ends of Europe Tour&quot; with Alcest and Junius in November of the same year. A music video for the single &quot;Lethean&quot;, directed by Lasse Hoile, was released on 18 February 2013. In September 2013, the band also released &quot;Dethroned &amp; Uncrowned&quot;, an album which featured more acoustic leaning re-workings of the songs from &quot;Dead End Kings&quot;. It was jointly funded by the Burning Shed record label and a crowd sourcing effort on PledgeMusic, which accumulated 190% of the target goal. The band embarked on an acoustic tour – &quot;The Unplugged &amp; Reworked Tour&quot; in support of the album in 2014. Just prior to the touring, the band released another EP of b-sides, &quot;Kocytean&quot; for Record Store Day 2014.

In 2014, Eriksson and Katatonia &quot;mutually agreed to part ways&quot; due to &quot;a difference in views&quot; and Eriksson&#x27;s decision to live in Barcelona. Bruce Soord of The Pineapple Thief temporarily filled in Eriksson for the band&#x27;s May tour, while Tomas Åkvik filled in on guitar afterwards in mid-2014. Longtime drummer Liljekvist also left the band in April 2014, on friendly terms, citing personal and financial reasons. The band released another live album, &quot;Sanctitude&quot;, on 31 March 2015. In November 2015, the band announced Daniel Moilanen as their new drummer and revealed that they were working on a new album to be released in 2016. The album, &quot;The Fall of Hearts&quot; was released on 20 May 2016. The album, as well as featuring new drummer Daniel Moilanen, was also the first to feature new guitarist Roger Öjersson; who replaced Eriksson&#x27;s position as second guitarist. Two singles were released in promotion of the album, &quot;Old Heart Falls&quot; and &quot;Serein&quot;. The band continued touring in support of the album in 2017, including a North American tour that started in March.

=== &quot;City Burials&quot; and &quot;Sky Void of Stars&quot; (2018–present) ===
The band announced they would enter a hiatus in 2018. The band cited Öjersson being hospitalized by a serious back injury at the end of 2017, and a number of other undisclosed issues, for the band needing to take some time off and &quot;re-evaluate what the future holds for the band.&quot; In February 2019, the band announced their return to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their 2009 album &quot;Night Is the New Day&quot;, with an anniversary tour and deluxe release of the album. Their eleventh studio album, &quot;City Burials&quot;, was released in April 2020; its first single was &quot;Lacquer&quot;. Unable to tour in support the album due to the oncoming of the COVID-19 pandemic, the band instead turned to releasing further music. This included releasing a new live album &quot;Dead Air&quot; (2020), a compilation album &quot;Mnemosynean&quot; (2021) and a box set of the band&#x27;s earliest material &quot;Melancholium&quot; (2022). and forging ahead into writing and recording a twelfth studio album.

The band released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Sky Void of Stars&quot;, on January 20, 2023, followed by a European and US tour.

== Musical style and influences ==
The band is known for changing its sound over the course of its three-decade career. Nystrom summarized it in a 2006 interview:
Yeah sure, we see ourselves as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We&#x27;re just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I&#x27;m proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We&#x27;re leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.

Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band&#x27;s live performances: Well, it must be hard sometimes for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters and at the same time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. I actually think much of the stuff he sings about doesn&#x27;t go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We&#x27;re not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don&#x27;t really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.

Renkse stated that early inspirations for Katatonia included bands of the death metal variety, namely Morbid Angel, Entombed, Carnage, Autopsy and Paradise Lost; especially the latter&#x27;s album &quot;Gothic&quot;. Moreover, Renkse has on multiple occasions cited the work of American progressive metal band Tool as an influence. Nystrom has cited the work of Porcupine Tree as a large influence for the band in their post-death metal eras. For the 2011 Katatonia documentary &quot;Last Fair Day Gone Night&quot;, Nyström also credited alternative metal bands such as A Perfect Circle and Mudvayne with inspiring the heavy, single-string riff-oriented sound introduced on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Viva Emptiness&quot;.

Their career, as a whole, has been summarized as being a metal band. Their early sound has been described as death-doom and death metal, and later they incorporated other styles, such as progressive rock, progressive metal, doom metal, gothic rock, gothic metal and post-metal.

== Comments from other musicians ==
Some artists and bands have cited Katatonia as an influence, among which are Agalloch, Nachtmystium, Andy Schmidt of Disillusion, Niklas Kvarforth of Shining, Klimt 1918, Marcela Bovio of Stream of Passion, Daylight Dies, Nucleus Torn, Khors, Marjana Semkina of iamthemorning, Wet, Vladimir Agafonkin of Obiymy Doshchu, Nahemah, Forest Stream, Forgotten Tomb, Alex Vynogradoff of Kauan, Bilocate, Maxime Côté of Catuvolcus, , , Schizoid Lloyd, and Pallbearer.

In addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work including Mark Jansen of Epica, Luc Lemay of Gorguts, Jim Matheos of Fates Warning, Esa Holopainen of Amorphis, and Bruce Soord of The Pineapple Thief.

<text>The Back Bay Fens, often simply referred to as &quot;the Fens,&quot; is a parkland and urban wild in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It was established in 1879. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to serve as a link in the Emerald Necklace park system, the Fens gives its name to the Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood.

== History ==
The Fens is a large picturesque park that forms part of Boston&#x27;s Emerald Necklace. It is essentially an ancient spot of saltwater marshland that has been surrounded by dry land, disconnected from the tides of the Atlantic Ocean, and landscaped into a park with fresh water within. The park is also known as the Fens or the Fenway. The latter term can also refer to either the surrounding neighborhood or the parkway on its southern border.

When Boston was settled in the early 17th century the Shawmut Peninsula on which it was built was connected to Roxbury by a spit of sandy ground called &quot;The Neck.&quot; The adjacent area of marshland to the west was a tidal flat of the Charles River. The area became malodorous with time as it became tainted with sewage from the growing settlement.

For the dual purpose of eliminating the health and aesthetic problem created by the polluted bay waters and creating new and valuable Boston real estate, a series of land reclamation projects was begun in 1820 and continued for the rest of the century. The filling of present-day Back Bay was completed by 1882. Filling reached Kenmore Square in 1890 and finished in the Fens in 1900. These projects more than doubled the size of the Shawmut Peninsula.

Olmsted&#x27;s challenge was to restore the spot of marsh which was preserved into an ecologically healthy place that could also be enjoyed as a recreation area. Combining his renowned landscaping talents with state-of-the-art sanitary engineering, he turned a foul-smelling tidal creek and swamp into &quot;scenery of a winding, brackish creek, within wooded banks; gaining interest from the meandering course of the water.&quot;

Olmsted designed the Fens to be flushed by the tides twice daily. However, in 1910 a dam was constructed at Craigie&#x27;s Bridge, closing the Charles River estuary to the ocean tides and forming a body of freshwater above the dam. Thus, the Fens became a freshwater lagoon regularly accepting storm water from the Charles River Basin.

Soon after, noted landscape architect Arthur Shurcliff, a protégé of Olmsted, added new features such as the Kelleher Rose Garden and employed the more formal landscape style popular in the 1920s and 1930s. An athletic field was also added.

In 1941, at the outbreak of United States involvement in World War II, citizens planted a victory garden within the Fens. While these were common in their era, the one in the Fens is now the last continually operating Victory Garden in existence and today is a much-valued community garden of flowers and vegetables.

In 1983, the Back Bay Fens were designated as a Boston Landmark.

The Emerald Necklace Conservancy is headquartered in the park and operates a year-round visitor center.

==Features==
===Entrances===

The Back Bay Fens was designed with six entrances, with straight roads and formal lawns that contrasted with the more wild Fens.

The original main entrance was the Beacon Entrance, running from Beacon Street to Boylston Street, bounded by Charlesgate East and Charlesgate West. A crescent-shaped bridge crossed over the Boston and Albany Railroad, connecting the Commonwealth Avenue Mall with the Fens at Gaston Square. The entrance has been wholly modified, beginning with the addition of a bridge for the Ipswich Street line in 1898. A bust of Patrick Collins was added shortly after the mayor&#x27;s 1905 death. The Charles River Esplanade, completed in 1910, connected with the Beacon Street end of the entrance. The bridge carrying Commonwealth Avenue was replaced with two bridges for separated eastbound and westbound traffic in 1917. Storrow Drive was built along the Esplanade in 1951–55, severing the connection with the Beacon Entrance. The construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension in the 1960s caused the removal of the curved bridge, separating the entrance (now Charlesgate Park) from the rest of the Fens. It was replaced with the Bowker Overpass, which overshadows the remaining parkland; the Muddy River was moved to a small side channel, and the bust was relocated east along the Mall. Isolated from the Fens, Charlesgate was included with the Commonwealth Avenue Mall in its 1978 Boston Landmark designation.

The Boylston entrance is located just southeast of the Beacon Entrance, where Boylston Street meets the Fenway. A statue of John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly was added in the triangular center of the junction in 1894. The intersection was rebuilt in 1982, with the statue relocated into the park.
The Westland Entrance is on the east side of the Back Bay Fens, with lawns lining a block of Westland Avenue between the Fenway and Hemenway Street. Westland Gate, a pair of marble monuments with lion&#x27;s-head fountains feeding horse troughs on the side, frames the entrance. It was designed by Guy Lowell and funded by Ellen Cheney Johnson as a memorial to her husband. Westland Gate was completed around 1905, at which time it replaced the Beacon Entrance as the main entrance to the Fens.

The Huntington Entrance runs along Forsyth Way from Huntington Avenue to the Fenway on the south side of the Fens, just east of the Museum of Fine Arts. As originally laid out by Olmsted, it had twin roadways framing a canal that carried the Stony Brook into the Muddy River, with a bridge carrying the Fenway and paths over the brook. The entrance was rebuilt several times as the Stony Brook was placed in conduits; the canal was filled in 1905 and the bridge demolished.

The Tremont Entrance is a wide formal lawn on the southwest corner of the Fens. It originally ran to the Fenway from Huntington Avenue at Longwood Avenue, in the direction of Tremont Street. Initial plans called for it to continue as a parkway to Tremont Street and over Parker Hill, but high lands prices prevented that design. The Emerald Necklace and its parkways were instead built along the Muddy River, and the Tremont Entrance was only built to Huntington Avenue. The Huntington end of the entrance was &quot;obliterated&quot; by expansion of Boston State College (now occupied by the Massachusetts College of Art and Design) in the 1960s and 1970s. The remaining section north of Tetlow Street is now Evans Way Park. The park and eponymous street were named for Robert Evans, whose wife Marie Antoinette Evans funded a new wing of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1915 in his memory.

The Longwood Entrance follows the Muddy River from Brookline Avenue at the west end of the Fens. Narrower than the main section of the Fens, the Longwood Entrance connects it to the Riverway. Roadway widenings in the 1950s covered over much of the river between Avenue Louis Pasteur and Brookline Avenue. Phase 1 of the Muddy River Restoration Project, which lasted from 2013 to 2016, daylit this section of the river and restored much of the former Longwood Entrance. The section between the Riverway and Avenue Louis Pasteur (including the former Longwood Entrance) was renamed as Justine Mee Liff Park in 2013, honoring a former Boston Parks and Recreation Commissioner. The park opened in April 2017.

===Bridges===

Within the main section of the Back Bay Fens (Boylston Street to Avenue Louis Pasteur), three road bridges and two footbridges cross the Muddy River. The road bridges were designed by John C. Olmsted, Frederick Law Omlsted&#x27;s adopted son. The largest and most significant is the Boylston Street bridge, designed as a &quot;brilliant collaboration&quot; between architect Henry Hobson Richardson (a frequent Olmsted collaborator) and the Olmsted firm. John Olmsted designed the main stone arch span, while Richardson added the tourelles flanking the arch. The foundation and abutments were built in 1880, though Richardson did not submit his design until July 1881. Cape Ann granite was not chosen as the material that December; although Richardson preferred rough boulders, seam-faced rock was used. The arch was constructed in 1883, and the bridge opened in 1884. The bridge was &quot;totally different from any other masonry bridge of its day&quot;, and Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge applied its scale and materials to later structures along the Emerald Necklace.

The Agassiz Road bridge, which connects Park Drive and the Fenway through the middle of the Fens, was designed by John Olmsted. It has five small brick arches, with granite abutments and piers supported by spruce piles driven into the marsh. The bridge is faced with Roxbury puddingstone salvaged from old walls in Franklin Park. Construction began in 1887 and was completed in February 1888; parapets were added when the road was paved in 1891.

The Fen Bridge connects Park Drive and the Fenway at the west end of the Fens opposite Avenue Louis Pasteur. Also designed by John Olmsted, it is a masonry arch with a span. Like the Agassiz Road bridge, its abutments are granite supported by spruce piles and the facing is reused Roxbury puddingstone. Construction lasted from February to November 1891; the bridge opened with Audubon Road (now Park Drive) on January 3, 1892. The cost of the bridge was $27,699 (). The triangular median at the south end of the bridge was designated Higginson Circle after Henry Lee Higginson in 1920. The west parapet was removed in the 1950s when the Muddy River was culverted through the Longwood Entrance.

A pair of footbridges are located on opposite sides of the Museum of Fine Arts: one across from Forsyth Way, the other north of Museum Road. They were built in the 1920s (the Forsyth Way bridge replacing an earlier crossing) as part of Arthur Shurcliff&#x27;s reconfiguration of The Fens, and rebuilt as concrete bridges with granite facing in 1979. A third footbridge at Evans Way existed in the early 20th century, but was gone by 1915. A replacement was designed during the 1920s work and finally built in 1939. The bridge was disassembled in 1979 with the other footbridges, but it was never rebuilt, possibly due to funding shortfalls created by Proposition 2½.

North from Boylston Street in Charlesgate Park, the Muddy River is crossed by Ipswich Street, the Worcester Main Line railroad bridge, the Massachusetts Turnpike, two bridges carrying Commonwealth Avenue, Beacon Street, and Storrow Drive, as well as the elevated Bowker Overpass and its ramps. The west border of the Fens (where it meets the Riverway) is Brookline Avenue, which crosses the Muddy River on a wide bridge completed in 2016.

===Former bridges===

Along with the Evans Way footbridge, two road bridges are no longer extant. The Fenway originally crossed the Stony Brook canal at the Huntington Entrance on a five-arched bridge designed by the firm of Walker &amp; Kimball. The outer arches were occupied by footpaths, allowing pedestrians to cross under the road. The bridge was faced with red brick ornamented with Milford granite; the archways were faced with patterns of colored glazed bricks. A small iron footbridge crossed the canal just north of the road bridge. The bridges were removed when the canal was filled in 1905; the road bridge was demolished with explosives.

At the Beacon Entrance, a curved bridge crossed the Boston and Albany Railroad (and after the 1890s, Ipswich Street). Its south end connected to Boylston Street at Gaston Square, while its north end met Commonwealth Avenue. Although Richardson sketched designs for truss and suspension bridges, Frederick Olmsted insisted on a plate girder bridge; Richardson&#x27;s contribution was ultimately the design of the decorative metalwork and lamps. The bridge was constructed in 1880–83. It was demolished around 1962 during construction of the Turnpike Extension and replaced by the Bowker Overpass, though the south abutment remains extant.

===Structures===
The Agassiz Road Duck House was designed by architect Alexander Longfellow, and built in 1897. It was used exclusively as a public restroom facility, and was closed after a damaging fire in 1986. The Duck House is sited within a prominent landscape in The Fens adjacent to the Agassiz Road bridge—the only building along that roadway. Agassiz Road is a significant pedestrian link between the East and West Fenway neighborhoods though it provides only one-way vehicular circulation. Much of the building that we see today is original; however, the roof design was simplified when it was reconstructed following the 1986 fire.

The Stony Brook Gatehouse was designed by Henry Hobson Richardson. The building features a slate roof with distinctive wooden beams and walls of smooth stones of varying cuts. The red mortar used between the stones is similar to that of many of Richardson&#x27;s other works. A similar companion building, designed by Richardson protege Edmund Wheelright, sits directly next to this structure. It was added at a later date to contain pump equipment for the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The Stony Brook Gatehouse has since been decommissioned and in 2010 was converted into the headquarters for the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, and a visitors&#x27; center by Ann Beha Architects.

Dedicated on December 27, 1925, the Fire Alarm Office is near the intersection of Westland Avenue and Hemenway Street. It is a neoclassical limestone building in the shape of a villa, with large ornate bronze entry doors to one side. Its facade is inscribed:
===Monuments and memorials===
A monument was dedicated in 1973 to baseball player and humanitarian Roberto Clemente (1934–1972). It is a stone marker inset with a large bronze relief of Clemente and a short inscription in Spanish and English, &quot;Roberto Clemente: His three loves; Puerto Rico, baseball, and children.&quot; The adjacent baseball diamond, which is part of the athletic field, is also dedicated in his honor.

The Katharine Lee Bates monument is a freestanding granite tablet inset with a bronze plaque on Agassiz Road overlooking the Muddy River and Stony Brook gatehouse. The plaque gives brief information on Bates and includes the lyrics of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, which she wrote at the turn of the 20th century.

Close to the Westland Gate is the John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly Memorial. This memorial, sculpted in 1894 by Daniel Chester French memorializes the Irish poet and editor of the Catholic newspaper &quot;The Pilot&quot;. In the front of the memorial sits the bust of O&#x27;Reilly while the backside depicts a statue of Erin weaving a wreath of laurel and oak for her sons Poetry and Patriotism with Celtic calligraphy as a backdrop.

Several streets surrounding the Fens (Kilmarnock, Queensbury) were given names of Scottish peerages and towns mentioned in Robert Burns&#x27;s literary works. In 1910 The Burns Memorial Association of Boston held a competition to make a statue of Burns, to correspond with that nomenclature as an honor. The winner was artist Henry Hudson Kitson. Kitson completed the statue in 1919, and Governor Calvin Coolidge dedicated it the next year on New Years Day, 1920. The piece was moved from the Fenway to Winthrop Square at Otis and Devonshire Streets, in the Financial District, in the summer of 1975. It was restored and returned to its original location on October 30, 2019.

A memorial commemorating the radio operators who lost their lives on merchant ships during the Second World War depicts a sinking ship with &quot;End of service&quot; in Morse Code around the base. It was moved in the 1990s to Peddocks Island at the request of veteran operators, as Peddocks was where they trained. Its plinth remains located on Agassiz Road adjacent to the Agassiz Bridge, overlooking the war memorials across from the Kelleher Rose Garden.

The Temple Bell, a bronze bell cast in 1675 by Tanaka Gonzaemon under the supervision of Suzuki Magoemon, was dedicated to Bishamon, a Buddhist god of children and good luck. The bell was contributed to the Japanese war effort in 1940 but ended up on a scrap heap in Yokosuka. Sailors from the USS Boston (CA-69) salvaged the bell after World War II, and offered it to the city of Boston in 1945. In 1953, Japanese officials presented the bell to Boston as a symbol of peace.

====John Endecott Monument====
Across from the Forsyth Dental Institute and Museum of Fine Arts on Forsyth Way, originally called the Huntington Avenue Entrance to The Fens, this is a large red granite monument and white granite statue of John Endecott. The statue is a standing portrayal of John Endecott dressed in early colonial attire, consisting of a jacket with a wide, square collar, knee breeches, buckle shoes, and a long cape. He holds his hat down at his side in his right hand. The sculpture rests on a square base that extends from a large granite wall with the inscription &quot;JOHN ENDECOTT 1588–1665&quot;. A low granite bench surrounds the base of the wall.

According to inscriptions on one side of the monument, it was designed by Architect Ralph Weld Gray, and the statue was sculpted by Carl Paul Jennewein in 1936. The rear of the monument features a large inscription, &quot;Bequest George Augustus Peabody Esquire of Danvers, Massachusetts&quot;. The main inscription features the seal of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the quote &quot;STRONG, VALIANT JOHN WILT THOU MARCH ON, AND TAKE UP STATION FIRST, CHRIST CAL&#x27;D HATH THEE, HIS SOLDIER BE, AND FAIL NOT OF THY TRUST -EDWARD JOHNSON 1654&quot;.

====Veterans Memorial Park====
Created by the George Robert White Fund in 1948, this is a grouping of three war memorials arranged around a circle, adjacent to the Keller Rose Garden, the Agassiz Bridge, and a concert grove that overlooks two gatehouses across the Muddy River.

This World War II memorial features a granite monument designed by architect Tito Cascieri. It is composed of a plinth stage and lectern backed by a semi-circular wall, with names set in bronze tablets. A large bronze statue of an angel sculpted by John F. Paramino sits atop the memorial, along with an obelisk capped with bronze stars. It is the oldest and largest of the three memorials on the site, with the Korean and Vietnam war memorials flanking it. The lectern has a plaque, added during the 1990s, rededicating the entire memorial as Veterans Memorial Park and honoring Sergeant Charles Andrew MacGillivary, a World War II Congressional Medal of Honor recipient who enlisted in Boston.

The Korean War Memorial is a small installation, compared to the World War II memorial nearby. This memorial has a stone plaza area, with a map of the country of Korea embedded in it. Flanking the map are two stone slabs for use as benches. The memorial is a squarish monument that has three columns with names engraved in them. On top is the word, &quot;Korea&quot; and the years, &quot;1950–1953.&quot;

The Vietnam War Memorial is a small installation, compared to the World War II memorial nearby. This memorial has a stone plaza area, with a map of the country of Vietnam embedded in it. Flanking the map are two stone slabs for use as benches. The memorial is a squarish monument that has three columns with names engraved in them. On top is the word, &quot;Vietnam&quot; and the years, &quot;1962–1975.&quot;

===Gardens===
The Victory Gardens are now named after Richard D. Parker, one of the original organizers of the garden, who gardened there until his death in 1975. The Victory Gardens in the Fenway are one of only two remaining victory gardens in the U.S. dating back to World War II, during which President Franklin Roosevelt encouraged Americans to grow their own vegetables. The City of Boston set up 49 areas to grow gardens, including plots on Boston Common and Boston Public Garden. The Fenway Victory Gardens were established in 1942. These gardens are a central part of the Fenway community and are well known to gardeners across the country. Residents use the plots to grow vegetables or flowers.

A passion for public rose gardens swept the country in the early 20th century. In 1930, landscape architect Arthur Shurcliff added a circular formal rose garden and fountain opposite the Museum of Fine Arts where the general public as well as rose enthusiasts could learn about rose culture and enjoy the flowers. The garden was expanded in 1933 when the rectangular section was built. At the south end of the rectangular portion of the garden is a statue that is a copy of the famous El Desconsol which was a gift to the City of Boston by Barcelona, Spain. In 1975, the garden was named the James P. Kelleher Rose Garden to honor the Boston Parks and Recreation Department&#x27;s Superintendent of Horticulture. By the late 20th century, The Kelleher Rose Garden was in decline and needed a complete restoration. In 2001, the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, in cooperation with the Boston Parks and Recreation Department, convened landscape architects, horticultural specialists, and rosarians to develop a master plan for its renewal. Paths and planting beds were recut according to the original plans; the soil was rejuvenated and new turf laid. An irrigation system was installed and new signs were placed to help visitors learn from the garden. The restoration was completed in 2008. In 2014 the Emerald Necklace Conservancy completed restoration of the original ornamental fountain and had the descendant of the original sculpture manufacturer replicate missing ornamental cherub statues.

=== Athletic fields===
As part of Arthur Shurcliff&#x27;s alterations to The Fens, an athletic track and field was constructed in 1923. Two massive cast stone bleachers were completed in 1926 followed shortly in 1928 by a field house designed by William D. Austin. The original field house was demolished in the 1980s, due to neglect, and replaced with a simple Gothic styled storage structure. The 420m athletic track and field was later dedicated as the Joseph Lee Playground. At some point two baseball diamonds were added. One of them is dedicated to baseball player and humanitarian Roberto Clemente with a cast stone monument featuring a brass relief &amp; dedication plaque. The other was dedicated to neighborhood residents Brian and David Cobe in 1984 with a bronze plaque inset into a Roxbury puddingstone boulder adjacent to the diamond. Sometime in the 1970s two basketball courts were also added alongside the playground and dedicated in honor of Jim Bradley. In 2010, as part of a public-private partnership between the City of Boston and Emmanuel College, the field was extensively renovated to collegiate standards, which necessitated the demolition of one of the stone bleachers.

<text>In cellular biology, durotaxis is a form of cell migration in which cells are guided by rigidity gradients, which arise from differential structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Most normal cells migrate up rigidity gradients (in the direction of greater stiffness).

== History of durotaxis research ==
The process of durotaxis requires a cell to actively sense the environment, process the mechanical stimulus, and execute a response. Originally, this was believed to be an emergent metazoan property, as the phenomenon requires a complex sensory loop that is dependent on the communication of many different cells. However, as the wealth of relevant scientific literature grew in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, it became apparent that single cells possess the ability to do the same. The first observations of durotaxis in isolated cells were that mechanical stimuli could cause the initiation and elongation of axons in the sensory and brain neurons of chicks and induce motility in previously stationary fish epidermal keratocytes. ECM stiffness was also noted to influence cytoskeletal stiffness, fibronectin fibril assembly, the strength of integrin-cytoskeletal interactions, morphology and motility rate, all of which were known influence cell migration.

With information from the previous observations, Lo and colleagues formulated the hypothesis that individual cells can detect substrate stiffness by a process of active tactile exploration in which cells exert contractile forces and measure the resulting deformation in the substrate. Supported by their own experiments, this team coined the term &quot;durotaxis&quot; in their paper in the &quot;Biophysical Journal&quot; in the year 2000. More recent research supports the previous observations and the principle of durotaxis, with continued evidence for cell migration up rigidity gradients and stiffness-dependent morphological changes 

== Substrate rigidity ==
The rigidity of the ECM is significantly different across cell types; for example, it ranges from the soft ECM of brain tissue to that of rigid bone or the stiff cell wall of plant cells. This difference in rigidity is a result of the qualitative and quantitative biochemical properties of the ECM or in other words, the concentration and categories of the various macromolecules that form the ECM meshwork. Though the ECM is composed of many intracellularly-synthesized components - including a number of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and fibrous proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and elastin - it is the latter two fibers that are most influential in defining the mechanical properties of the ECM.

Collagen is the fibrous protein that gives the ECM its tensile strength, or rigidity. Elastin - as its name suggests - is a highly elastic protein with an important role in tissues that need to return to their original positions after deformation, such as skin, blood vessels, and lungs. The relative concentrations of these two main determinants, along with other less influential matrix components, determine the rigidity of the ECM. For example, collagen concentration has been reported to be correlated to matrix stiffness, both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; (gels).

=== Measuring rigidity ===
In biological research, the rigidity (or stiffness) is commonly measured using Young&#x27;s modulus of elasticity, the ratio of stress to strain along an axis, in Pascals. Thus, a material with a high Young&#x27;s modulus is very rigid. The most precise and well-established method to measure Young&#x27;s modulus of a tissue relies on instruments - such as the Instron load cell device - that directly apply a mechanical load and measure the resulting deformation. Now, the Young&#x27;s modulus of a tissue can be easily and accurately estimated without excision using a variety of elastography techniques. These methods induce distortion in the tissue and measure the mechanical properties, usually with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Young&#x27;s modulus has been repeatedly used to characterize the mechanical properties of many tissues in the human body. The stiffness of animal tissues varies over several orders of magnitude, for example:
* Bovine articular cartilage - 950 kPa 
* Mouse skeletal muscle - 12 kPa 
* Guinea pig lung - 5-6 kPa 
* Human fibrotic liver - 1.6 kPa, healthy human liver 640 Pa 
* Swine brain - 260-490 Pa 

=== Synthesizing varying rigidity ===
Matrices of varying stiffness are commonly engineered for experimental and therapeutic purposes (e.g. collagen matrices for wound healing). Durotactic gradients are simply made by creating 2-dimensional substrates out of polymer (e.g. acrylamide or polydimethylsiloxane) in which the stiffness is controlled by cross-linking density, which in turn is controlled by cross-linker concentration. The polymer must be coated with a material that the cell can adhere to, such as collagen or fibronectin. The gradients themselves are often synthesized as hydrogels using microfluidic gradient generators followed by photopolymerization.

An advancement to this technique is the use of 3D matrices, which are able to guide cell migration in conditions that are more relatable to the natural three dimensional environment of the cell.

The site of cellular contact with the extracellular matrix is the focal adhesion, a large, dynamic protein complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the ECM fibers through several organized layers of interacting proteins. Integrins are the outermost proteins and the ones that bind directly to the ECM ligands. However, focal adhesions are quite more than simple anchors - their proteins have many roles in signaling. These proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, vinculin, paxillin, and α-actinin, interact with small GTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42) and other signaling pathways in order to relay even small changes in matrix stiffness and consequently respond with changes in cell shape, actomyosin contractility, and cytoskeletal organization. As a result, these changes can cause a cell to rearrange its cytoskeleton in order to facilitate directional migration.

A cell&#x27;s cytoskeleton is a constantly fluctuating network of polymers whose organization greatly depends on the physical environment of the cell. At the focal adhesions, a cell exerts a traction force. In other words, it pulls on the ECM. Thus, the cell maintains a mechanical homeostasis between ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension across its focal adhesions. This homeostasis is dynamic, as the focal adhesion complexes are continuously constructed, remodeled, and disassembled. This leads to changes in signal transduction and downstream cellular responses. Cell signaling is a product of both the physical and biochemical properties of the ECM and interaction between these two pathways is crucial to understand cellular responses. For example, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - a growth factor - is unable to induce osteogenesis under insufficient cytoskeletal tension.

The source of cytoskeletal traction is actomyosin contractility. Increased external stiffness leads to a signal transduction cascade that activates the small GTPase Rho and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK, in turn, controls myosin light chain phosphorylation, an event that triggers myosin ATPase activity and the shortening of actin fibers, causing contraction and pulling on the ECM. Though the precise pathway that connects ECM stiffness to ROCK activity is unknown, the observation of increased traction in response to increased ECM stiffness is sufficient to explain the phenomenon of durotaxis. The stronger mechanical feedback would pull the cell towards the stiffer region and cause a bias in directional movement and have other consequences on cytoskeletal and focal adhesion organization.

Consequently, durotaxis must rely on continuous sampling of ECM stiffness over space and time in a process called rigidity mechanosensing. Recent research has revealed that individual focal adhesions do not necessarily exert stable traction forces in response to unchanging ECM stiffness. In fact, while some individual focal adhesions may display stable traction forces, others exhibit tugging traction in the manner of a repeated cycle of tugging and release. The properties of focal adhesions - whether stable or tugging - are independent of their neighbors and as such, each focal adhesion acts autonomously. This tugging traction has been shown to be dispensable to other forms of cell migration, such as chemotaxis and haptotaxis, but required for durotaxis. The focal adhesion proteins (FAK/paxillin/vinculin) - and their phosphorylation-dependent interactions as well as their asymmetrical distribution within the cell (i.e. YAP activation and nuclear translocation via stiffness activated pFAK) - are required in order to exhibit high traction and tugging traction across a wide range of ECM rigidities. Furthermore, a reduction in focal adhesion tension by transferring cells to softer ECM or by inhibiting ROCK results in focal adhesion switching from stable to tugging states. Thus, rigidity mechanosensing allows a cell to sample matrix stiffness at the resolution of focal adhesion spacing within a cell (≈1-5μm).

The integration of biochemical and mechanical cues may allow fine-tuning of cell migration. However, the physiological reasoning behind durotaxis—and specifically the tendency of cells to migrate up rigidity gradients—is unknown.

== Measuring traction ==
The most prevalent and accurate modern method for measuring the traction forces that cells exert on the substrate relies on traction force microscopy (TFM). The principle behind this method is to measure deformation in the substrate by calculating 2-dimensional displacement of fluorescent beads that are embedded in the matrix. High-resolution TFM allows the analysis of traction forces at much smaller structures, such as focal adhesions, at a spatial resolution of ≈1 μm.

== Clinical significance ==
The role of durotaxis under physiological conditions remains unknown. It may serve a purpose in fine-tuning the movement response of a cell to extracellular biochemical cues, though the relative contribution of durotaxis in a physiological environment where a cell is subject to other taxes (e.g. chemotaxis) is unknown, and may in fact prove to be wholly dispensable for cell migration &quot;in vivo&quot;. The phenomenon might also have a role in several disease states that include the stiffening of tissues, as outlined below.

=== Cancer ===
It is a common observation that tumors are stiffer than the surrounding tissue, and even serves as the basis for breast cancer self-examination. In fact, breast cancer tissue has been reported to be as much as ten times stiffer than normal tissue. Furthermore, a growing and metastasizing tumor involves the cooperation of many different cell types, like fibroblasts and endothelial cells, that possess different rigidities and could result in local stiffness gradients that guide cell migration. There is increasing evidence that durotaxis plays a role in cancer metastasis. Experiments in mice have demonstrated that tumor cells preferentially invade into the adjacent stroma along stiff collagen fibers. These stiff collagen alignments can be used to identify focal sites of breast tumor cell microinvasion. Pregnancy, which has various links to breast cancer incidence and prognosis, involves postpartum breast involution that relies on collagen remodeling and inflammation that converts these collagen fibers into stiffer counterparts, thus establishing a potential link between pregnancy and metastatic properties. Though some research shows that stiffer tumors are indicative of increased metastasis and decreased survival (which contradicts the concept that durotactic cells should be more attracted to the tumor and metastasize less), this is not counter intuitive because collagen-dependent integrin signaling has a wide range of consequences beyond durotaxis, including inhibition of the tumor suppressor PTEN via upregulation of the miRNA miR-18a. Moreover, there is evidence that increased tumor stiffness does in fact correlate with decreased metastasis, as the principle of durotaxis would suggest.

=== Liver fibrosis ===
Fibrosis of the liver is the accumulation of ECM proteins, such as collagen, that occurs in many chronic liver diseases. Increased liver stiffness (of existing collagen) has actually been shown to precede fibrosis and to be required for the activation of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts move towards the stiffer tissue via durotaxis, and upon reaching it, will differentiate into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. This vicious positive feedback loop of durotaxis-dependent fibrosis could potentially be a therapeutic target for the prevention of liver fibrosis.

=== Atherosclerosis ===

The pathology of atherosclerosis is largely dependent on the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into the tunica intima layer of the blood vessel, where they can accumulate lipids, undergo necrosis, and elaborate the ECM (fibrosis). The migration of these cells has also been demonstrated to be rigidity-dependent, and matrix stiffness further affects their proliferation in response to growth factors.

== Mathematical models ==
Several mathematical models have been used to describe durotaxis, including:
* One 2-dimensional model based on the Langevin equation, modified to include the local mechanical properties of the matrix.
* One model based on the description of durotaxis as an elastic stability phenomenon where the cytoskeleton is modeled as a planar system of prestressed elastic line elements that represent actin stress fibers.
* A model where stiffen mediated persistence has the form of Fokker-Planck equation.
*A model where stiffen mediated persistence affect durotaxis.

<doc id="1087987" wikidata="Q1404928" url="?curid=1087987" title="Fenway–Kenmore">
<text>Fenway–Kenmore is an officially recognized neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is considered one neighborhood for administrative purposes, but it is composed of numerous distinct sections (East Fenway/Symphony, West Fenway, Audubon Circle, Kenmore Square) that are almost always referred to as &quot;Fenway&quot;, &quot;the Fenway&quot;, &quot;Kenmore Square&quot;, or &quot;Kenmore&quot;.

Fenway is named after the Fenway, the main thoroughfare laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted. Fenway–Kenmore&#x27;s population was 40,898 as of the 2010 Boston Redevelopment Authority Census, while its land area was defined to be .

==Location==

On the east, Fenway–Kenmore is separated from the Back Bay neighborhood by Charlesgate West, the Massachusetts Turnpike, Dalton Avenue and Belvidere Street. The South End is across Huntington Avenue near The First Church of Christ, Scientist headquarters, a major tourist attraction. East Fenway (generally south of the Massachusetts Turnpike) is separated from West Fenway by the Muddy River, which flows through the Back Bay Fens and into the Charles River north of Kenmore.

The Longwood Medical Area is sometimes included as a part of Fenway, and is located across the Back Bay Fens from the West Fenway area. To the south of the neighborhood is the Mission Hill area, which is sometimes considered to be part of Roxbury, which continues as the border extends along Ward, Parker, and Ruggles Streets, and the Southwest Corridor. The Kenmore neighborhood is located north and west of Fenway, roughly separated by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Kenmore includes the part of Boston University campus east of the Boston University Bridge, where it meets the Allston neighborhood, although due to the size of the university, it is sometimes considered to be its own neighborhood. Southwest of the Boston University campus and west of the Longwood Medical Area is the town of Brookline.

Throughout the neighborhood are brownstone townhouses, brick walk-ups, and five- to six-story apartment buildings, typically constructed between 1880 and 1930. Small, independently-owned shops are scattered throughout. Major commercial developments are in Kenmore Square and along Brookline Avenue, Beacon Street, Boylston Street, and Huntington Avenue. The baseball stadium Fenway Park is located immediately south of the Turnpike from Kenmore Square. Parts of Boston University, Northeastern University, the Berklee College of Music, and the Boston Conservatory of Music are located in Fenway–Kenmore, and many students reside in the neighborhood. Over the last 20 years almost every residential building in Kenmore has been purchased by Boston University and turned into dorms, especially in the Audubon Circle area between Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue.

==History==
The Fenway–Kenmore area was formed by land annexed from neighboring Brookline in the 1870s as part of the Brookline-Boston annexation debate of 1873 as well as from land filled in conjunction with the creation of landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted parks in the 1890s.
When planned, it was thought that the buildings built upon the Fenway parkway would house high-wealth residents and that the whole area would be a high-class neighborhood. As property values rose, however, it was educational institutions that sprung up along the Fenway&#x27;s route. By 1907, there were twenty-two educationally focused organizations, including nine college and universities which had made their homes on the Fenway. Residential buildings that were built needed their frontages to be approved by the Park Board so that a &quot;poor looking building [did not] depreciate the value of the whole neighborhood&quot;. Additionally, the Board had discretion on whether it felt a proposed building was suitable for frontage along the park and parkway. The hope of these building restrictions was that there would be an improvement in the look of the Fenway compared to neighboring streets.

In the last few years, development in Fenway has picked up, particularly from developer Samuels and Associates. Recent developments include the renovation of the Landmark Center; the 2003 addition of Hotel Commonwealth on the site of the Rathskeller bar; and the 576-unit, 17-floor Trilogy apartment building on Brookline Avenue and Boylston Street. 1330 Boylston, a second high-rise apartment building, was completed in 2008 and contains 210 apartments, of office space contained within 10 floors and the new home of Fenway Health.

Planned developments include a 24-story mixed use development at the confluence of Boylston Street and Brookline Avenue, likely including retail, dining, and luxury hotel/apartments. Other plans include the renovation of the Howard Johnson motel on Boylston Street, to be rehabbed as an upscale hotel. Additionally, developer John Rosenthal is planning to build a complex named One Kenmore over the Mass Pike alongside the Beacon Street Bridge, comprising 525 units in one 17 floor tower and one 20 floor tower. Concerning infrastructure, in 2007 the MBTA renovated the Fenway Green Line stop and in 2014 renovated the nearby Yawkey commuter rail station. Finally, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston recently completed a $425 million expansion, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum completed construction of a second building.

===Street names===
West Fenway features streets named after Scottish cities and towns present in Robert Burns&#x27; literary works; Peterborough, Kilmarnock, Queensberry. This was a result of influence by the (Robert) Burns Memorial Association of Boston influencing the city of Boston when a decision was made to simplify the original neighborhood plan by Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s office. As originally planned in 1894, the street naming system was to continue the system originating in the Back Bay of naming streets in alphabetical order. Where the Back Bay proper ends at Hereford Street, the Fenway was to continue Ipswich, Jersey, Kenyon (Kilmarnock), Lansdowne, Mornington, Nottingham, Onslow, Peterborough, Queensberry, Roseberry, Salisbury, Thurlow, Uxbridge, Vivian, Westmeath (Wellesley), (with X omitted), York, and Zetland.

The parkways surrounding the Back Bay Fens, Fenway and Park Drive, are named after various parks which are part of the Emerald Necklace park system. Other streets in Fenway are named after institutions or civic minded patrons within the neighborhood: Palace Road (formerly Worthington Street), Forsyth Way (formerly Rogers Avenue), Evans Way, Forsyth Street, Hemenway Street (formerly Parker Avenue), Agassiz Road (named after Ida Agassiz), Higginson Circle (named after the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra), Evans Way (named after the donor of the Evans Wing at the Museum of Fine Arts), Tetlow Street (named after the headmaster of Girls Latin School at its former location), Symphony Road (formerly Batavia Road), St. Stephens Street (St. Stephen&#x27;s Church became St. Ann&#x27;s, which is now known as Northeastern University&#x27;s Fenway Center), Opera Place (the Boston Opera House was demolished in 1958), and Speare Place (formerly a continuation of St. Stephens Street which itself was formerly Falmouth Street).

==Demographics==

The median income for a household in the neighborhood was $25,356. 37.3% of the population was below the poverty line, while the unemployment rate was 11.4%.

East Fenway has a large student population due to its proximity to area colleges and universities, while West Fenway, formerly known as a student haven, has seen rising interest from young professionals and families. The Kenmore Square area is mainly commercial with many residential units now owned by Boston University and used as on-campus housing for students.

<text>The Gewisse ( ; ) were a tribe or ruling clan of the Anglo-Saxons. Their first location, mentioned in early medieval sources, was the upper Thames region, around Dorchester on Thames. However, some scholars suggest that the Gewisse had origins among the ancient Britons at &quot;Cair-Caratauc&quot; (Old Sarum) in Wiltshire. According to Saxon folklore, the Gewisse were the founders of the kingdom of Wessex.

==Etymology==
The name was first documented as &quot;Gewissorum&quot; in the eighth century as an ethnonym of the West Saxons. Its origin is uncertain. The Old English adjective means &quot;reliable&quot; or &quot;sure&quot;, and its corresponding noun means &quot;certainty&quot;. Eilert Ekwall proposed that the similarity in toponymy between the kingdoms of the Gewisse and Hwicce suggests a common origin, and an analysis by Richard Coates concluded that &quot;Hwicce&quot; was of Brittonic origin.

Several linguists believe that the word is not the result of natural linguistic development, but may have been adopted as ethno-political propaganda.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; presents an eponymous ancestor figure, named &quot;Giwis&quot;, which is an example of non-historical founding myths.

The Winchester (or Parker) Chronicle has &quot;Cynric, son of Cerdic, son of Elesa, son of Gewis, son of Wig, son of Freawine, son of Frithugar, son of Brand, son of Beldeg, son of Woden, son of Finn, son of Godwulf, son of Geats&quot; listed as descent from Cerdic of Wessex. This manuscript does not present Gewis as eponymous, but in the Parker Manuscript&#x27;s current state, is reconstructed from both apparently missing pages of the work, as well as a later fire, long after the manuscript had been recorded and disseminated. According to the Stanford Library, the Provenance of the manuscript is as follows:

==History==
Evidence of Germanic settlements appearing around Abingdon and Dorchester on Thames in the 6th and 7th centuries has been used to make assumptions about the origins of the &quot;Ġewisse&quot;, presuming them to be Germanic mercenaries who may have settled in the region after the end of the Roman occupation to protect a border region between Britons. Another theory holds that the name of the tribe and its founding house is Brittonic and that they originated from the area that would become Old Sarum.

The early Saxon myths say that the Gewisse captured &quot;Searobyrig&quot; (Old Sarum) in 552 AD and &quot;Beranbyrig&quot; (Barbury Castle) from the Britons in 556. Birinus converted the Gewisse to Christianity in 636 by baptising their king Cynegils and establishing the Diocese of Dorchester. The Gewisse killed the three sons of Sæbert of Essex around 620, defeated the Britons at the Battle of Peonnum in 660, and by 676 had sufficient control over what is now Hampshire to establish a see at Winchester.

The conquests by the royal house of Gewisse in the 7th and 8th centuries led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Wessex, and Bede treated the two names as interchangeable. It was only during the reign of Cædwalla (685/86 – 688) that the title &quot;king of the Saxons&quot; began to replace &quot;king of the Gewisse&quot;. Barbara Yorke has suggested that it was Cædwalla&#x27;s conquest of the Jutish province and the South Saxons that led to the need for a new title to distinguish the expanded realm from its predecessor. However, as there are no surviving documents to indicate how these people described themselves, the most that can be said is that by the time Bede was writing (early 8th century), the phrase &quot;West Saxons&quot; had come into use by scholars.

<text>Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, also known as the Deutsch catalogue, is a numbered list of all compositions by Franz Schubert compiled by Otto Erich Deutsch. Since its first publication in 1951, Deutsch (abbreviated as D or D.) numbers are used for the unique identification of Schubert&#x27;s compositions.

==1951 edition==
The Deutsch catalogue was first published in London in 1951 by J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, as &quot;Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, compiled by O. E. Deutsch, in collaboration with Donald R. Wakeling.&quot;

==1978 edition: NSE VIII/4==
In 1978, as part VIII Supplement / Volume 4 of the New Schubert Edition (NSE), an updated version of the catalogue was published in German.

A few compositions that had been undated in the first edition received a new number (usually followed by a letter), e.g. was renumbered to .

==Later versions==
The original 1951 edition (in English) was re-issued several times, for instance in the United States by W. W. Norton. The 1978 version, published by Bärenreiter, had a double objective: it was not only a list of Schubert&#x27;s works as such, it was also the compendium of all scores published by that publisher in the New Schubert Edition.

===New versions in English===
In 1995 Dover Publications republished the 1951 edition, with updates derived from scholarship that had been published since 1951.

===New versions in German===
From 1983 compact versions of the catalogue appeared, edited by Werner Aderhold and others.

Changes to the numbering of Schubert&#x27;s works were minor in these later editions.

<text>The Vancouver special is an architectural style of residential houses developed in Metro Vancouver, Canada. The architectural style was generally utilized from the 1960s to 1980s due to an ability to maximize floor space with relatively cheap construction costs.

==Background==
Vancouver specials were mass-produced between 1965 and 1985. However, there are examples of homes built in the late 1940s which share the characteristics of a Vancouver special.

The houses were first built in southeast Vancouver in the early 1960s to serve newly-arrived immigrants from Europe. However, the mass production of the Vancouver special is primarily attributed to the South Asian community after a wave of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s prompted many new immigrants to settle in the area and preside over the last large scale residential development in southeast Vancouver.

In response to public reaction to the proliferation of this design, the City of Vancouver made changes to the single-family zoning regulations in the 1980s with the intent to stop additional Vancouver specials from being built. However, other Lower Mainland cities have not substantially changed their housing codes over the past 25 years with respect to this kind of housing design. Thus, it is still possible to build (and buy) new houses (of very similar design to the classic Vancouver specials) in the Lower Mainland.

==Characteristics==

Vancouver specials are front-gabled, two-storey, boxy houses built on grade (i.e., without a raised foundation), with low-pitched roofs. They contain a shallow balcony on the second floor accessed by sliding glass doors. The front door is typically set to one side of the house, which allows for main living quarters on the upper floor and secondary suites on the bottom. Ground level facades are typically finished with brick or stone, with stucco at the higher levels.

== Geographical distribution ==
Vancouver specials can be found all over Greater Vancouver due to their mass production. The architectural housing design can also be seen elsewhere in the outer regions of the Lower Mainland and other parts of southern British Columbia. 

The housing architecture also can be found substantially in Victoria, Comox, Duncan and Nanaimo (on Vancouver Island) but is less common due to the different economic conditions and constraints there.

== Cultural references ==
The much maligned Vancouver special, however, may yet see its bad reputation improve. Some indications include a locally produced music compilation compact disc in 2000, &quot;Vancouver Special&quot;, which features several examples of the house design on the cover, and a renovated Vancouver special that won the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia&#x27;s Innovation Award for Architecture in 2005.

A home design store on Main Street bears the name &quot;Vancouver Special&quot; and Arsenal Pulp Press of Vancouver published &quot;Vancouver Special&quot;, a book of essays about the city by Charles Demers, in November 2009, showing that the reputation of the homes may have now gained a certain vintage glamour.

Local brewery, R&amp;B Brewing, offers a West Coast IPA named after the Vancouver special.

<doc id="1088030" wikidata="Q1888642" url="?curid=1088030" title="The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992">
<text>The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992 is a box set of albums by the English rock musician George Harrison. It was released in 2004 and comprises most of the singer&#x27;s output on his Dark Horse record label. The set contains Harrison&#x27;s five studio albums from &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; (1976) to &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; (1987), with bonus tracks, and his 1992 live album (spread over two discs) &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, which features a special SACD remix in addition to its original mix. The six albums were also made available as separate releases. The set&#x27;s eighth disc, a DVD titled &quot;The Dark Horse Years&quot;, includes promotional videos of Harrison&#x27;s singles from the 1976–88 era and footage from his 1991 Japanese tour. The box set was followed by the 2014 release of &quot;The Apple Years 1968–75&quot;, which compiles Harrison&#x27;s output on the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records.

==Background==
George Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse material had been issued on CD in 1991, but was allowed to go out of print some years later. By 2000, he was keen to reissue his entire catalogue, but only managed to oversee the 30th anniversary edition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; before his death from cancer in November 2001. Following posthumous projects such as &quot;Brainwashed&quot; and Concert for George over 2002–03, Harrison&#x27;s widow Olivia and son Dhani compiled the box set for release.

==Content and omissions==
Harrison&#x27;s intended artwork for &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; (1981) was reinstated for this 2004 reissue. In addition, the lettering on the front of the album &quot;George Harrison&quot; was modified from the original 1979 release.

Included in the eight-disc box set was a 36-page booklet containing rare photos, including several of Harrison taken by photographer Terry O&#x27;Neill. Among the essays in the booklet, music journalist David Fricke supplied an appreciation of Harrison&#x27;s career on Dark Horse, and Olivia Harrison, who worked for the label in the 1970s, wrote a piece titled &quot;The History of Dark Horse&quot;. All studio albums featured at least one bonus track, while the individual digital editions of the albums featured additional bonus tracks.

Despite the title of the set, not every track from Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse years appears. The song &quot;Lay His Head&quot;, which was the B-side to &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot;, and the two tracks that Harrison recorded for the compilation &quot;Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989&quot; – &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot; and &quot;Poor Little Girl&quot; – are all omitted from &quot;The Dark Horse Years&quot;. &quot;Cheer Down&quot;, which was Harrison&#x27;s contribution to the 1989 film &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, is also not included, although a live version appears on &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, and non-album single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Do It&quot; is missing as well. Also missing is the song &quot;Sat Singing&quot; that was among other songs intended for &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; in 1980 but rejected by Dark Horse distributor Warner Bros. Records, forcing Harrison to record new material for that album. On the DVD, the videos for his singles &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Blow Away&quot; and &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot; are similarly not included.

==Release and reception==

&quot;The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992&quot; was released on 23 February 2004 on the Dark Horse label, but distributed by EMI rather than Warner Bros. The release date roughly coincided with what would have been Harrison&#x27;s 61st birthday and a period of recognition for his achievements as a solo artist, through the Concert for George and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Each of the six albums in the box set was also available individually, and the DVD was later issued as an independent release.

In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh wrote that, while Harrison&#x27;s career on Dark Horse Records lacked an album as strong as his 1970 triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, he released &quot;some minor gems&quot; between 1976 and 1992 that showed him &quot;refin[ing] his craft&quot; and grappling with conflicting philosophies regarding his sense of individuality and spiritual purpose. Puterbaugh concluded: &quot;With all the honesty he could muster, Harrison addressed these philosophical divides while trying to create appealing pop music, too. The joy is that he succeeded so often.&quot; John Harris of &quot;Mojo&quot; admired the set as &quot;beautifully presented&quot; but he said the quality of the albums was indicative of all the former Beatles&#x27; decline as artists and that only &quot;Somewhere in England&quot; and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; represented a consistent focus on Harrison&#x27;s part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo&quot;&gt;John Harris, &quot;Filter Reissues: George Harrison&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, April 2004, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, James Griffiths opined that the box set &quot;provides an illuminating service&quot; by offering evidence of Harrison&#x27;s humour and the quality of his songwriting long after the Beatles. Griffiths summed up the message: &quot;The Under-Rated One, rather than the Quiet One, shall we say.&quot; Paul Du Noyer, writing in &quot;The Word&quot;, identified &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; as the high points of the set. He said that Harrison, as a musician first and foremost, &quot;maintained a quizzical distance from pop culture&quot; and that &quot;[his] innate caution kept his music inside a certain stylistic range, but also guaranteed a level of artistic consistency.&quot;

<text>Tadeusz Konwicki (22 June 1926 – 7 January 2015) was a Polish writer and film director, as well as a member of the Polish Language Council.

==Life==
Konwicki was born in 1926 as the only son of Jadwiga Kieżun and Michał Konwicki in Naujoji Vilnia, where he spent his early childhood. His father died early and Konwicki lived with his great-aunt and great-uncle who he later depicted in his novels. He attended a local Sigismund Augustus Gymnasium in Vilnius. 

=== World War II ===
Immediately following the outbreak of World War II, Vilnius was occupied by the Soviet Union and subsequently by Nazi Germany, and all education for Poles was discontinued. 

Konwicki continued his studies underground and joined the Home Army&#x27;s that took part in Operation Tempest and Operation Ostra Brama. He later disarmed and went into hiding from the Soviet Army. In November 1944, he joined Tur&#x27;s (Witold Turonek) unit and fought until April 28, 1945 - one of the last guerrilla units in the area. After the war Vilnius was occupied by the Soviet Union and Konwicki was expatriated.

=== Cold War ===
In the spring of 1945 Konwicki moved to Kraków, where he enrolled at Jagiellonian University. He also started to work as a journalist at &quot;Odrodzenie&quot; weekly, moving to Warsaw in 1947 to continue his work for the magazine. In the capital, he was one of the leading advocates for Socialist Realism in literature. In 1948 he finished his memoirs of his partisan years (&quot;Rojsty&quot;), but the book was not published until 1956. His literary debut was the (production novel) &quot;Construction Site&quot; (1950, &quot;Przy budowie&quot;), which was followed by the novel &quot;Power&quot; (1954, &quot;Władza&quot;). His 1956 novel &quot;From a Besieged City&quot; (1956, &quot;Z oblężonego miasta&quot;) also became quite popular.

In the years 1952–1966 he was a member of Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. By the mid-1950s, Konwicki had become disillusioned by the communist regime in Poland and fell out of grace with the party. His later works (beginning with &quot;A Hole in the Sky&quot; (1959, &quot;Dziura w niebie&quot;), are mostly concerned with the author&#x27;s childhood and the semi-mythical, romantic land of his youth.

At this time Konwicki became the head of the Kadr Film Studio and has since been recognized as one of the most notable members of the Polish Film School. However, his work veered away from the style pursued by his contemporaries, due to its uniquely bitter quality. As a filmmaker he is known for his Venice&#x27;58 Grand Prix winner &quot;The Last Day of Summer&quot; (&quot;Ostatni dzień lata&quot;, 1958), &quot;All Souls&#x27; Day&quot; (&quot;Zaduszki&quot;, 1961), as well as for his masterpieces Salto (1962) and &quot;How Far Away, How Near&quot; (&quot;Jak daleko stąd, jak blisko&quot;, 1973), as well as film adaptations: of Nobel Prize Winner Czesław Miłosz&#x27;s book &quot;Issa Valley&quot; (&quot;Dolina Issy&quot;, 1982), and of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s drama &quot;Forefather&#x27;s Eve&quot; – &quot;Lava&quot; (1989).

He is widely known for two novels, published by the Polish underground press: &quot;The Polish Complex&quot; (1977) and &quot;A Minor Apocalypse&quot; (1979). The latter work, a bitter satire about a washed-up writer who is asked to burn himself in front of the Soviet-built Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw; the novel was adapted as a 1993 French feature film, directed by Costa-Gavras. &quot;A Minor Apocalypse&quot; is a post-Orwellian parody that refers to specific historical events, such as self-immolation protests against the communist regime by Ryszard Siwiec in Poland and Jan Palach in Czechoslovakia.

<text>John Houston Ingle (May 7, 1928 – September 16, 2012) was an American actor best known for his roles as scheming patriarch Edward Quartermaine in the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and Mr. Threehorn, the father of the main character Cera in the &quot;Land Before Time&quot;.

==Career==

A retired high school drama teacher, Ingle began mainstream acting in 1985 doing various guest appearances; one of his first cinema appearances was a performance of the song &quot;Puzzling Evidence&quot; in the 1986 David Byrne musical, &quot;True Stories&quot; (his recording of the song would not be released until 2018). In 1993, he took over the role of Edward Quartermaine in &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He had appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the late 1980s as a W.S.B. associate of Anna Devane.

In December 2003, Ingle was fired and Edward was to be killed off. Without a contract to keep him at &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Ingle was free to court other offers and accepted the contract role of Mickey Horton, as a recast for the retiring John Clarke, on the soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Ingle left &quot;General Hospital&quot; in February 2004 and Edward was recast with Jed Allan.

Once at &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, Ingle became part of a love triangle story involving Bonnie (Judi Evans Luciano) and Maggie (Suzanne Rogers). Ingle had recurring roles in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and the long-running &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;.

Ingle played &quot;Wise Paw&quot; in the 21-episode 1985 syndicated series &quot;Paw Paws&quot;, a segment of the animated block The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera.

Ingle returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Edward Quartermaine, being re-hired after public complaints about Ingle&#x27;s mistreatment by the producers, on a recurring basis, starting in April 2006.

==Personal life==
John Houston Ingle was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He graduated from Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Occidental College in Los Angeles. He began teaching English and theater in 1955 at Hollywood High School until transferring in 1964 to teach drama at Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California, until his retirement in 1985. His pupils included Nicolas Cage, Albert Brooks, Richard Dreyfuss, Joanna Gleason, Barbara Hershey, Swoosie Kurtz, Stefanie Powers, David Schwimmer, Jonathan Silverman, and Julie Kavner. He called former &quot;General Hospital&quot; actor Stuart Damon his &quot;closest friend&quot;. Ingle, along with actress Leslie Charleson, fought Damon&#x27;s 2007 dismissal from &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Health==
In late 2008, Ingle underwent treatment for a small section of melanoma on his scalp. He was forced to wear a hat while onscreen to cover the bandage. Ingle was an active volunteer with Habitat for Humanity.

==Family and death==
Ingle married Grace-Lynne Martin in 1954. They had five daughters. Grace-Lynne Ingle died on February 11, 2012. Ingle died seven months later on September 16, aged 84, after battling cancer.

<doc id="1088035" wikidata="Q9389395" url="?curid=1088035" title="Sentence (music)">
<text>In Western music theory, the term sentence is analogous to the way the term is used in linguistics, in that it usually refers to a complete, somewhat self-contained statement. Usually a sentence refers to musical spans towards the lower end of the durational scale; i.e. melodic or thematic entities well below the level of movement or section, but above the level of motif or measure. The term is usually encountered in discussions of &quot;thematic construction&quot;. In the last fifty years, an increasing number of theorists such as William Caplin have used the term to refer to a specific theme-type involving repetition and development.
==Sentence as a metaphor for musical statement==
Since the word &quot;sentence&quot; is borrowed from the study of (verbal) grammar—where its accepted meaning is one that does not admit of straightforward application to musical structures—its use in music has frequently been metaphorical. Especially before the latter half of the twentieth century, different musicians and theorists employ and define the term in different ways. For example, Stewart Macpherson defines a musical sentence as &quot;the smallest period in a musical composition that can give in any sense the impression of a complete statement.&quot; It &quot;may be defined as a period containing two or more phrases, and most frequently ending with some form of perfect cadence.&quot; Among the simplest examples he gives are what he calls &quot;duple sentences&quot; -- themes (from Mozart&#x27;s D major Piano Sonata and Beethoven&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto) in which we find pairs of &quot;balanced&quot; phrases (four-bar &quot;announcing phrase&quot; ending in half-cadence, followed by four-bar &quot;responsive phrase&quot; ending with perfect cadence): to many modern theorists this kind of structure is called a period. Similarly, the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music&quot; states that the term &quot;sentence&quot; &quot;has much the same meaning as &#x27;period&#x27;, though it lacks the flexibility of the latter term.&quot;

==Sentence as a specific form-type: Schoenberg tradition==

Arnold Schoenberg applied the term &quot;sentence&quot; to a very specific structural type distinct from the antecedent-consequent period. In a sentence&#x27;s first part, a statement of a &quot;basic motive&quot; is followed by a &quot;complementary repetition&quot; (e.g. the first, &quot;tonic version&quot;, of the shape reappears in a &quot;dominant version&quot;); in its second part this material is subjected to &quot;reduction&quot; or &quot;condensation&quot; with the intention of bringing the statement to a properly &quot;liquidated&quot; state and cadential conclusion. The sentence was one of a number of basic form-types Schoenberg described through analysis; another was the period. In Schoenberg&#x27;s view, &quot;the sentence is a higher form of construction than the period. It not only makes a statement of an idea, but at once starts a kind of development&quot;.

Schoenberg&#x27;s conception of the sentence has been widely adopted in music theory, and appears in many introductory music theory textbooks. While Schoenberg&#x27;s conception of the sentence is traditionally used in analysis of music from the Classical period, it has also been applied to the Classical music of the 19th and 20th centuries, and to American popular songs from the early twentieth century.

<doc id="1088050" wikidata="Q3365448" url="?curid=1088050" title="Parkdale (federal electoral district)">
<text>Parkdale was a Canadian federal electoral district represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1979. It included the community of Parkdale in the western part of Toronto, Ontario. It was created in 1914 from Toronto West, and continued to exist until 1976 when most of it was merged into Parkdale—High Park with some sections into Trinity.

==Boundary history==
It initially consisted of the part of the city of Toronto west of a line beginning where Queen Street West meets Lake Ontario, east along Queen Street West to Dovercourt Road, north the Canadian Pacific Railway, west to the boundary of Ward 7, then along the boundary of Ward 7 to the northwest corner of High Park.

In 1924, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto east of Atlantic Avenue and Dovercourt Road, and south of Bloor Street, and west of Indian Road and following Indian Road, Howard Park Avenue, and Sunnyside Avenue.

In 1933, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto east of the westerly limit of Davenport Riding from Lake Ontario to the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway; thence westerly along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway to the boundary between ward six and ward seven of the city of Toronto; thence southerly along the boundary between ward six and ward seven to the point where it intersects Bloor Street; thence westerly along the centre line of Bloor Street to the centre line of Indian Road; thence southerly along the centre line of Indian Road to the centre line of Howard Park Avenue; thence easterly along the centre line of Howard Park Avenue to its intersection with the centre line of Sunnyside Avenue; thence southerly along the centre line of Sunnyside Avenue to Lake Ontario; thence easterly along Lake Ontario to Dufferin Street.

It was further redefined several times.

In 1966, it was defined to consist of the part of Toronto west of Atlantic Avenue and Dovercourt Road, south of Bloor Street, and east of Parkside Drive.

The electoral district was abolished in 1976 when it was merged with parts of the High Park-Humber Valley and Trinity districts to form Parkdale—High Park.

<text>Clyde, formerly Dunstan, is a small town in Central Otago, New Zealand with a population of in It is located on the Clutha River, between Cromwell and Alexandra.

==History==
Clyde grew up around the former settlement of Dunstan during the Otago gold rush of the 1860s. The town could once claim to be the most populous in New Zealand during the height of gold fever. The town&#x27;s post office (and thus the town) was officially renamed from Dunstan to Clyde on 22 May 1865, after Lord Clyde.

St Dunstan&#x27;s Church a now heritage building designed by the architect Francis William Petre in the early English Gothic revival style was built in Clyde in 1903.

==Geography==
More recently the town has been known for the Clyde Dam, a giant hydroelectric dam at the north end of the town, behind which lies Lake Dunstan. The Clutha River is the swiftest river (per volume) in the southern hemisphere. The river then runs to the Roxburgh Dam before finally meeting the sea at Balclutha.

===Climate===

==Economy and infrastructure==
The town is a popular holiday spot. It lies at the western end of the Otago Central Rail Trail. The Otago Central Branch Railway originally terminated at Cromwell, but this section of the railway was closed in 1980, with the railway to Clyde used to bring materials for the dam project. The rail trail is nowadays often cycled and walked by visitors and locals alike.

The township is home to Dunstan Hospital, serving the surrounding district, including Alexandra and Cronwell. The hospital was rebuilt in 2006 with the original building remaining.

Clyde is fast becoming known as a tourist haven. The location is particularly attractive to those visiting the region&#x27;s many vineyards and orchards. The regional weather is particularly warm and dry during the summer months due to the rain shadow effect caused by the Southern Alps (given New Zealand&#x27;s westerly winds).

During the week beginning 22 September, the Clyde/Alexandra district hosts a Blossom Festival. This event celebrates the beginning of spring which brings the blossoming of fruit trees in the area&#x27;s orchards. Entertainment at the festival includes a parade with floats made by local businesses, fun park rides, and bands.

<text>Mesca Ulad (English: &quot;The Intoxication of the Ulaid&quot;; the Ulstermen) is a narrative from the Ulster Cycle preserved in the 12th century manuscripts the Book of Leinster and in the Lebor na hUidre. The title &quot;Mesca Ulad&quot; occurs only in the Book of Leinster version. The story is set during Samhain, and follows the Ulaid as they attempt to attend two feasts in the same night: the first at Dún Dá Bhenn (modern day County Londonderry) to the north, and the second at Cúchulainn&#x27;s fortress in Dún Delgan (modern Dundalk, Co. Louth) to the east. The men become intoxicated at the first feast and head south towards Kerry by accident. In Kerry, they are shown false hospitality by their traditional enemies the Munstermen, who offer them a place to stay. The Ulaid accept, and the Munstermen light a bonfire beneath the wood and iron structure. The Ulaids survive.

<text>Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany () (1362 – 24 May 1425) was a leading Scottish nobleman, the son of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, and the grandson of King Robert II of Scotland, who founded the Stewart dynasty. In 1389, he became Justiciar North of the Forth. In 1402, he was captured at the Battle of Homildon Hill and would spend 12 years in captivity in England.

After his father died in 1420, and while the uncrowned King James I of Scotland was himself held captive in England, Stewart served as Governor of Scotland until 1424, when James was finally ransomed and returned to Scotland. However, in 1425, soon after James&#x27;s coronation, Stewart was arrested, found guilty of treason, and executed, along with two of his sons. His only surviving heir was James the Fat, who escaped to 
Antrim, Ireland, where he died in 1429. Stewart&#x27;s wife Isabella of Lennox survived the destruction of her family. She lived to see the assassination of James I and the restoration of her title and estates.

== Early life ==
Stewart was born in 1362, the only son of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (1340–1420), and his wife Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith. Duke Robert was a leading Scottish nobleman who was Regent of Scotland at various stages during the reigns of three kings, (Robert II, Robert III, and James I). In addition, Duke Robert held the titles of Earl of Menteith (28 February 1361), Earl of Fife (1361; resigned in 1372), Earl of Buchan (1394; resigned in 1406) and Earl of Atholl. In addition to exercising considerable power and wealth, the Albany Stewarts were potential heirs to the throne; Murdoch&#x27;s grandfather was King Robert II of Scotland, who was the first member of the Stewart dynasty to rule Scotland.

Murdoch Stewart was raised in a large family, having eight sisters:
* Janet Stewart (married Sir David de Moubray);
* Mary Stewart (married Sir William Abernathy, 6th of Saltoun);
* Margaret Stewart (married to Sir John Swinton, 14th of that Ilk);
* Joan Stewart (married Sir Robert Stewart, Lord of Lorn);
* Beatrice Stewart (married Sir James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas);
* Isabella (Isobel) Stewart (married to Alexander Leslie, 7th Earl of Ross and later to Walter de Haliburton, 1st Lord Haliburton of Dirleton);
* Lady Marjorie Stewart (married to Sir Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell);
* Lady Elizabeth Stewart (married to Malcolm Fleming, ancestor of Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming).

His mother Margaret died in 1380. His father Duke Robert married a second time, to Muriella de Keith, with whom he had four children, the elder of whom was John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan (1381–1424).

In 1389, at around age 27, Murdoch was appointed Justiciar North of the Forth. Father and son would now work together to expand their family interest, bringing them into violent confrontation with other members of the nobility, such as Donald McDonald, 2nd Lord of the Isles.

== War and capture ==

Stewart served in Scottish military actions against the English in the early 15th century and was captured at the Battle of Homildon Hill, which took place on 14 September 1402 in Northumberland, England. Led by Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, the Scottish army had invaded England bent on plunder, in part to avenge the killing and capture of Scottish nobles in the Battle of Nesbit Moor on 22 June 1402. While returning to Scotland, they were intercepted by English forces led by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. The result was a decisive defeat of the Scottish army.

William Shakespeare later wrote, in his play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;:
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
Balk&#x27;d in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedon&#x27;s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
And is not this an honourable spoil?
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
--- William Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part 1, act 1, scene 1.
Murdoch Stewart (described above as &quot;Mordake the Earl of Fife&quot;) was held as a prisoner in England for the next twelve years.

== Politics ==
Murdoch Stewart&#x27;s captivity in England did not prevent his father from ruthlessly pursuing the family interest, often through violent means. On 26 March 1402 the Duke of Albany&#x27;s nephew, David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, had died in Falkland Palace while under his uncle&#x27;s protection. King Robert III of Scotland, fearful that his younger son Prince James, the heir to the throne of Scotland, would suffer the same fate, sent him out of the kingdom to escape Albany&#x27;s clutches. In 1406 James boarded the &quot;Maryenknyght&quot;, a ship from Danzig that was bound for France, but on 22 March 1406, the ship was taken by English pirates off Flamborough Head and James was delivered as a prisoner to King Henry IV of England. Soon afterwards, on 4 April 1406 King Robert III died, leaving Scotland without a King. Prince James, now the heir to the throne of Scotland and just 12 years old, would endure 18 years of detention in England. In his absence the Albany Stewarts took the reins of power, and Murdoch&#x27;s father, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, became Governor of Scotland, king in all but name. The English price of returning James to Scotland was English overlordship of Scotland, something that few Scots were prepared to accept.

At this time Murdoch Stewart was still a prisoner in England, but in 1416 he was exchanged for Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and he returned to Scotland. The Albany Stewarts took James&#x27;s lands under their own control, depriving the king of income and any of the regalia of his position. James was referred to in the official records as merely &quot;the son of the late king&quot;.

=== Governor of Scotland and Duke of Albany ===
In 1420, on his father&#x27;s death, Murdoch, now aged 58, finally inherited the Dukedom of Albany. He also inherited the Earldom of Fife and the Earldom of Menteith, and at last became Governor of Scotland in his own right. He would hold this position from 1420 to 1424, while King James I was still held captive in England. Few serious attempts appear to have been made by Duke Albany to return James to Scotland, but eventually political pressure compelled Murdoch to agree to a general council.

=== Ransom and return of James I ===

In August 1423 it was agreed that an embassy should be sent to England to negotiate James&#x27;s release. A ransom treaty of 60,000 marks (an enormous sum) was agreed at Durham on 28 March 1424, to which James attached his own seal – he and his queen, accompanied by an escort of English and Scottish nobles, proceeded to Melrose Abbey, arriving on 5 April where he met Albany to receive the governor&#x27;s seal of office. Upon the return of James I to Scotland, Albany lost his position as Regent.

James began to consolidate his position. His coronation took place at Scone on 21 May 1424. At his coronation parliament the king – probably with the intent of securing a cohesive political community loyal to the crown – knighted 18 prominent nobles including Albany&#x27;s son Alexander Stewart.

At this stage, it is probable that the king felt unable to take action against the Albany Stewarts while Murdoch&#x27;s brother, John Stewart, Earl of Buchan and Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas were fighting the English in France alongside their Dauphinist French allies. Buchan was a soldier with an international reputation and commanded the large Scottish army of around 6,000 men, a formidable force. In addition, he was Constable of France, making him the effective commander of the entire French army. However, both he and Douglas were killed at the Battle of Verneuil in August 1424 and the Scottish army was routed – the loss of these Albany allies with their fighting force left Murdoch politically exposed. James moved swiftly against his Albany Stewart relatives soon afterwards.

=== Arrest ===
Murdoch was arrested, along with his younger son Lord Alexander Stewart. Albany was at first confined in the castle at St. Andrews and afterwards transferred to Caerlaverock Castle. His wife Isabella was captured in the family&#x27;s fortified castle of Doune, their favourite residence, and committed to Tantallon Castle.

James&#x27;s older brother David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay had died young, in Falkland Castle, while in the care of Murdoch&#x27;s father, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. Though Albany had been exonerated by Parliament, the suspicion of foul play remained. Moreover, neither Duke Robert nor his son Murdoch had exerted themselves in negotiating James&#x27;s release while in English captivity. This may well have left James with the suspicion that the Albany Stewarts had personal designs on the throne of Scotland.

At this time Albany&#x27;s other son Walter was already in prison. James, Murdoch&#x27;s youngest son (also known as James the Fat), escaped arrest. and fled into the Lennox, where he began to organise a revolt, leading men of Lennox and Argyll in open rebellion against the crown. He attacked and burned the burgh of Dumbarton with much loss of life. This resort to violence by Albany&#x27;s youngest son may spurred the king into bringing a charge of treason against the Albany Stewarts, however, it is likely there was other evidence (no longer extant) for him to have gained the support of the leading magnates.

== Trial and execution ==
Duke Murdoch, his sons Walter and Alexander, and Duncan, Earl of Lennox were in Stirling Castle for their trial on 18 May 1425, at a prorogued parliament in the presence of the King. An assize of seven earls and fourteen lesser nobles – including Albany&#x27;s half uncle Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, first cousin Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, first cousins once removed Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas, and Alexander, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles – heard the evidence that linked the prisoners to the rebellion in the Lennox – in a trial lasting just one day the four men were found guilty of treason.

Walter was condemned on 24 May 1425. Albany and his son Alexander were tried before the same jury the following day. All the prisoners were publicly beheaded on Heading Hill &quot;in front of&quot; Stirling Castle. Albany was attainted and all of his peerage titles were forfeited. He was buried at Blackfriars&#x27; Church, Stirling.

In the destruction of his close family, the Albany Stewarts, James I gained the substantial rents from the family&#x27;s three forfeited earldoms of Fife, Menteith and Lennox, a blow from which the Albany Stewarts never recovered. More importantly, he secured his reign from the threat which had been constantly posed to him by the Albany Stewarts since his older brother&#x27;s death, probably at their hands, decades before.

== Marriage and children ==
Murdoch was married to Isabella, daughter of Donnchadh, Earl of Lennox. They had four sons and a daughter:
* Robert Stewart (d. 1421);
* Walter Stewart (executed 1425). Married to Janet Erskine; father of:
** Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avondale who became Lord of Avondale in 1459, and Lord Chancellor of Scotland in the same year, becoming one of the leading servants of King James III of Scotland. He would hold the office of Chancellor for 25 years, dying in 1488;
** Walter Stewart of Morphie;
*** Alexander Stewart;
**** Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Avondale;
***** Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, married to Margaret Tudor as her 3rd husband; her 1st was James IV of Scotland.
* Alexander Stewart (executed 1425);
* James the Fat (Seamas Mòr) Stewart, fled to Ireland and died in 1429.
* Isabel, who married Sir Walter Buchanan, 12th Laird of Buchanan.

== Ancestry ==
== Legacy ==
Albany&#x27;s sole surviving male heir was his youngest son, James the Fat who, after his failed rebellion, escaped to Ireland following the execution of his father and brothers. James remained in Ireland, unable to return, and died there in 1429. He was never able to inherit his father&#x27;s titles, since they had been declared forfeit under the attainder. Albany&#x27;s grandson, James &quot;Beag&quot; Stewart (c 1410—1470), would eventually secure a pardon from the King and return to Scotland, though the family would never recover their lost estates. James &quot;Beag&quot; Stewart is the ancestor of the Stewarts of Ardvorlich on Lochearnside, whose family history is recounted by Sir Walter Scott in &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot;.

Albany&#x27;s wife, Isabella of Lennox, survived the execution of her family, though she spent eight years as a royal prisoner at Tantallon Castle. In 1437, after the death of James I, she at last recovered her lands and title. In the next few years, although forced to govern her province from Loch Lomond, she issued a large number of charters and was tolerated by James&#x27;s successor, King James II of Scotland, who allowed her to assume all her titles and honors as Duchess of Albany and Countess of Lennox.

<text>Aljama (, , ) is a term of Arabic origin used in old official documents in Spain and Portugal to designate the self-governing communities of Moors and Jews living under Christian rule in the Iberian Peninsula. In some present-day Spanish cities, the name is still applied to the quarters where such communities lived, though they are many centuries gone.

The Jewish communities of Spain, owing to their social isolation and to the religious and political regulations imposed upon them, had always formed groups apart from the rest of the population. The authority exercised by their own rabbis and the system of tax-collection by the heads of the congregations for the administration of communal affairs, placed them almost completely without the jurisdiction of the government of the country. As a result, they soon came to be dealt with by the officials not as subjects amenable to the general law of the land, but as collective bodies with special privileges and special duties.

Thus, the Visigothic kings imposed a tax not upon each individual Jew or upon the heads of families, but upon the community as a whole, allowing the communal authorities to fix the individual rate of taxation. But both under the Visigoths and under the Moors there was neither regularity in the transactions of the rabbis and elders nor system in the attitude of the government toward the Jewish communities. With the reestablishment of Christian rule, however, the relation between the government and its Jewish subjects gradually became a well-defined one.

In 1219 and 1284 in Toledo, in 1273 in Barcelona, in 1290 at Huete, and on more than one occasion during those years in Portugal, councils were held of Spanish officials and Jewish representatives for the purpose of establishing a just rate of taxation for Jewish communities, and of devising adequate means for tax-collection. This first official recognition by the government of the Jewish communities as separate bodies led to a still further change in the treatment of the Jewish congregations and in the legislation, both local and national, regarding them.

The bishops of the various districts assumed immediate authority over them, and, in conjunction with Jewish representatives, formed rules which were henceforth to govern the communities. The elections of rabbis and judges were to be held at stated intervals, and the names of these dignitaries submitted to the bishop for approval; there was to be a (; ) for the presentation of communal questions before the proper authorities; and the heads of the congregation were made answerable for the conduct of the community. In all government action, whether local or general, the unit considered was in most cases the community, not the individual Jew.

The governing authority of the state sometimes nominated a member of the Jewish community to the administrative position of crown rabbi to act as intermediary between the aljama and the state. For example in the Kingdom of Aragon, King John I issued edicts in 1386 defining the functions and duties of the . There were various requirements as to the good character and faith of the person holding the position, as well as a requirement that he live among the entourage of the Court, and thus away from his community, and in constant contact with the Christian majority population. His powers and authorities over the of Castile, economic, judicial, and otherwise, were specified.

==Etymology and development of the concept==
The word &quot;aljama&quot; comes from Arabic and refers to the congregational mosque of a Muslim community, where believers gather to pray jumu&#x27;ah, the communal Friday prayer.

The word &quot;aljama&quot; is derived from plus the definite article . &quot;Jāmiʿa&quot; originally meant &#x27;congregation,&#x27; &#x27;assembly,&#x27; or &#x27;group,&#x27; but was, even before the establishment of Spanish rule, applied by the Moors to their religious bodies and larger mosques, and especially to the Jewish communities in the midst of them, and to the synagogues and schools which formed the center of all Jewish life. The Christians adopted the term, extending its meaning to designate the Jewish and Muslim quarters. In some Spanish cities, former Jewish quarters are still known by that name, even though the Jews were expelled in 1492.

Very often, for purposes of distinction, such phrases as &#x27;Aljama of the Jews&#x27; and &#x27;Aljama of the Moors&#x27; were used. But the circumstance that the Moors of Spain had by the term designated more especially the Jewish community has left its trace in the use of the word in Spanish; for in Spanish literature , without any further specification, stands for or (Jewish quarter), or even for Jewish places of worship, in the concrete as well as abstract sense. This use occurs at a very early date. In the &quot;Poem of Alexander&quot;, the &quot;Milagros de Nuestra Señora,&quot; and the &quot;Duelo de la Virgen&quot; of Gonzalo de Berceo, all of the 13th century, or &quot;alfama&quot; is employed to designate the people of ancient Jerusalem; and the historian of the 16th century, Mariana, uses for the synagogue: &quot;they devastated their houses and their .&quot;

==&quot;Tecana&quot; of Valladolid==

A good example of how much self-government was granted to the Jewish Aljamas is afforded by the &quot;resolution of the meeting&quot;, in Spanish called (from takkanah (), a Hebrew word that, like , has been incorporated into Spanish) arrived at by the Aljama of Valladolid in 1432. The report is written partly in Hebrew and partly in Spanish in the Hebrew alphabet and is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France at Paris (&quot;Fonds hébreux,&quot; No. 585).

From this document, it is learned that, at Valladolid, electoral meetings were held by the community every ten years and that the particular meeting of which an account is given in the document took place in the latter part of Iyar (end of May) and lasted for ten days. The following were some of the matters decided or discussed: 
# The necessity of the Talmud Torah, or Hebrew school, and the rate of taxation for the maintenance of the same, which was decided upon as follows: five maravedís for each of the cattle killed, and one for each sheep; five maravedis for every flask of wine. Five maravedis were also to be paid by a married couple on their wedding day and by a boy on the day of his bar mitzvah. A tax was also laid upon inheritances, and various other means of revenue were devised. In connection with this question the employment and salary of private or itinerant teachers were discussed.
# The election of the judges and the rabbi of the court, to which much space is accorded in the . 
# The attitude of the individual Jew in his relations with the state. This was by far the most critical question discussed. Since permission to decide civil and criminal cases before the government had been granted to Jewish judges, and since &quot;the Christians, though they be well versed in law, know nothing of Jewish laws,&quot; no Jew might plead before a Christian judge, whether religious or civil, except in cases where the taxes and imposts due to the ruler were in litigation, or where special permission was obtained from the , or chief judge of the Aljama. A Jew who arrested another Jew with the aid of a Christian was to be apprehended by the ; for a second offense of the same nature, he was to be branded on the forehead and expelled. A third offense was punishable by death.

The ability to impose capital punishment indicates how broad the Jewish community&#x27;s autonomy was.

<doc id="1088069" wikidata="Q1755223" url="?curid=1088069" title="Southern Accents">
<text>Southern Accents is the sixth studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on March 26, 1985, through MCA Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot;, co-written by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics, peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song &quot;Southern Accents&quot; was later covered by Johnny Cash for his &quot;Unchained&quot; album in 1996.

==Background==

Originally conceived as a concept album, the theme of &quot;Southern Accents&quot; became somewhat murky with the inclusion of three songs co-written by Stewart, and several others originally planned for the album left off. Songs cut from the track list include &quot;Trailer&quot;, &quot;Crackin&#x27; Up&quot; (a Nick Lowe cover), &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; (a Jimmy Reed cover), &quot;The Image of Me&quot; (a Conway Twitty cover), &quot;Walkin&#x27; from the Fire&quot;, and &quot;The Apartment Song&quot;. The first two were released as B-sides, while the two remaining covers (and a demo version of &quot;The Apartment Song&quot;) were later released on the &quot;Playback&quot; box set. A studio version of &quot;The Apartment Song&quot; appeared on Petty&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, released in 1989. &quot;Trailer&quot; was later re-recorded and released in May 2016 by Petty&#x27;s other band Mudcrutch, on its second studio album, &quot;2&quot;. &quot;Walkin&#x27; from the Fire&quot; was eventually released on the posthumous box set &quot;An American Treasure&quot; in 2018. The song &quot;My Life/Your World&quot; from &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot; included several of the song&#x27;s lyrics rewritten.

While mixing the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Rebels&quot;, Petty became frustrated and punched a wall, severely breaking his left hand. Subsequent surgery on his hand left him with several pins, wires and screws holding his hand together.

The album cover features an 1865 painting by Winslow Homer titled &quot;The Veteran in a New Field&quot;.

The album would prove to be the last album to have any involvement of bassist Ron Blair until 2002.

== Critical reception ==
In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that while &quot;occasionally, the songs work&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot; and &quot;Make It Better (Forget About Me)&quot; expand [the band&#x27;s] sound nicely&quot;, the record was too often &quot;weighed down by its own ambitions&quot;.

In the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;, Connor Goodwin said the album is &quot;deeply embedded in nostalgia for the Lost Cause.&quot;

<doc id="1088071" wikidata="Q379203" url="?curid=1088071" title="Khieu Samphan">
<text>Khieu Samphan (; born 28 July 1931) is a Cambodian former communist politician and economist who was the chairman of the state presidium of Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia) from 1976 until 1979. As such, he served as Cambodia&#x27;s head of state and was one of the most powerful officials in the Khmer Rouge movement, although Pol Pot remained the General Secretary (highest official) in the party.

Prior to joining the Khmer Rouge, he was a member of Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum government. After the 1967 leftist rebellion, Sihanouk ordered the arrest of leftists including Samphan, who fled into hiding until the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975. On 7 August 2014, along with other members of the regime, he was convicted and received a life sentence for crimes against humanity during the Cambodian genocide, and a further trial found him guilty of genocide in 2018. He is the oldest living former prime minister and the last surviving senior member of the Khmer Rouge following the deaths of Nuon Chea in August 2019 and Kang Kek Iew (Duch) in September 2020.

==Biography==
Samphan was born in Svay Rieng Province to Khieu Long, who served as a judge under the French Protectorate government and his wife Por Kong. Samphan was of Khmer-Chinese extraction, having inherited his Chinese heritage from his maternal grandfather. When Samphan was a young boy, Khieu Long was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to imprisonment, leaving Samphan&#x27;s mother to take up a living selling fruits and vegetables in Kampong Cham Province where he grew up. Nevertheless, Samphan managed to earn a seat at the Lycée Sisowath and was able to travel to France to pursue his university studies in Economics at the University of Montpellier, after which he earned a PhD at the University of Paris.

Samphan became a member of the circle of leftist Khmer intellectuals studying at the Sorbonne, Paris, in the 1950s. His 1959 doctoral thesis &quot;Cambodia&#x27;s Economy and Industrial Development&quot; advocated national self-reliance and generally sided with dependency theorists in blaming the wealthy, industrialized states for the poverty of the Third World. He was one of the founders of the Khmer Students&#x27; Association (KSA), out of which grew the left-wing revolutionary movements that would so alter Cambodian history in the 1970s, most notably the Khmer Rouge. Once the KSA was shuttered by French authorities in 1956, he founded yet another student organization, the Khmer Students&#x27; Union.

Returning from Paris with his doctorate in 1959, Samphan held a law faculty position at the University of Phnom Penh and started &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;, a French-language leftist publication that was viewed with hostility by the government. &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot; was banned by the government in the following year and police publicly humiliated Samphan by beating, undressing and photographing him in public. Despite this, Samphan was invited to join Prince Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum, a &#x27;national movement&#x27; that operated as the single political party within Cambodia. Samphan stood as a Sangkum deputy in the 1962, 1964 and 1966 elections, in which the lattermost the rightist elements of the party, led by Lon Nol, gained an overwhelming victory. During his tenure, according to Minister of Information Trinh Hoanh, he was known as &quot;a modest man of relatively humble origins who, even while minister of economy, refused to be driven in a Government limousine&quot;. In 1966, he then became a member of a &#x27;Counter-Government&#x27; created by Sihanouk to keep the rightists under control. However, Samphan&#x27;s radicalism led to a split in the party and he had to flee to a jungle after an arrest warrant was issued against him. At the time, he was even rumoured to have been murdered by Sihanouk&#x27;s security forces.

In the Cambodian coup of 1970, the National Assembly voted to remove Prince Sihanouk as head of state, and the Khmer Republic was proclaimed later that year. The Khmer Rouge, including Samphan, joined forces with the now-deposed Prince Sihanouk in establishing an anti-Khmer Republic coalition known as the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK), and an associated government: the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK). In this alliance with his former enemies, Samphan served as deputy prime minister, minister of defence, and commander-in-chief of the Cambodian People&#x27;s National Liberation Armed Forces, the GRUNK military. FUNK defeated the Khmer Republic in April 1975 and took control of all of Kampuchea.

During the years of Communist Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), Samphan remained near the top of the movement, assuming the post of president of the central presidium in 1976. His faithfulness to Pol Pot meant that he survived the purges in the later years of the Khmer Rouge rule. His roles within the party suggest he was well entrenched in the upper echelons of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, and a leading figure in the ruling elite.

In 1985, he officially succeeded Pol Pot as leader of the Khmer Rouge, and served in this position until 1998. In December 1998, Samphan and former Pol Pot deputy Nuon Chea surrendered to the Royal Cambodian Government. Prime Minister Hun Sen, however, defied international pressure and Samphan was not arrested or prosecuted at the time of his surrender.

==Arrest and trial==

On 13 November 2007, the 76-year-old Samphan reportedly suffered a stroke. This occurred one day after the former Khmer Rouge Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ieng Sary and his wife were arrested for war crimes committed while they were in power. At about the same time, a book by Samphan, &quot;Reflection on Cambodian History Up to the Era of Democratic Kampuchea&quot;, was published; in the book, he wrote that he had worked for social justice and the defence of national sovereignty, while attributing responsibility for all of the group&#x27;s policies to Pol Pot.

According to Samphan, under the Khmer Rouge, &quot;there was no policy of starving people. Nor was there any direction set out for carrying out mass killings&quot;, and &quot;there was always close consideration of the people&#x27;s well-being&quot;. He acknowledged the use of coercion to produce food due to shortages. Samphan also strongly criticized the current government in the book, blaming it for corruption and social ills.

Historian Ben Kiernan stated that Samphan&#x27;s protestations (such as he regarded the collectivization of agriculture as a surprise, and his expressions of sympathy for Hu Nim, a fellow member of the CPK hierarchy tortured and killed at Tuol Sleng) betrayed the fundamental &quot;moral cowardice&quot; of a man mesmerized by power but lacking any nerve.

After he left a Phnom Penh hospital where he was treated following his stroke, Samphan was arrested by the Cambodia Tribunal and charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes.

In April 2008, Samphan made his first appearance at Cambodia&#x27;s genocide tribunal. His lawyers, Jacques Vergès and Say Bory, used the defence that while Samphan has never denied that many people in Cambodia were killed, as head of state, he was never directly responsible for any crimes. On 7 August 2014, he and Nuon Chea received life sentences for crimes against humanity. His lawyer immediately announced the conviction would be appealed. The tribunal continued with a trial on his genocide charges as a separate process. The tribunal found him guilty on 16 November 2018 of the crime of genocide against the Vietnamese people, but he was cleared of involvement in the genocidal extermination of the Chams. The judgment also emphasised that Samphan &quot;encouraged, incited and legitimised&quot; the criminal policies that led to the deaths of civilians &quot;on a massive scale&quot; including the millions forced into labour camps to build dams and bridges and the mass extermination of Vietnamese.

On 16 August 2021, Samphan appeared before a court in Phnom Penh to appeal against his conviction, in an attempt to overturn it. The appeal was rejected on 22 September 2022, with the guilty verdicts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention affirmed.

<doc id="1088085" wikidata="Q5893962" url="?curid=1088085" title="Honeytoken">
<text>Honeytokens are fictitious words or records that are added to legitimate databases. They allow administrators to track data in situations they wouldn&#x27;t normally be able to track, such as cloud-based networks. If data is stolen, honey tokens allow administrators to identify who it was stolen from or how it was leaked. If there are three locations for medical records, different honey tokens in the form of fake medical records could be added to each location. Different honeytokens would be in each set of records.

The uniqueness of Honeytokens is the ability to use it as an intrusion-detection system (IDS), as it proactively works to find suspicious activity within a computer network, alerting the system administrator to things that would otherwise go unnoticed. Along with its practice in organizations, Honeytokens provides drastic improvements to network security as Firewalls alone only can look outwardly to prevent incoming threats while Honeytokens look inwardly to see threats that may have slipped by a firewall. This is one case where they go beyond merely ensuring integrity, and with some reactive security mechanisms, may prevent the malicious activity, e.g. by dropping all packets containing the honeytoken at the router. However, such mechanisms have pitfalls because they might cause serious problems if the honeytoken was poorly chosen and appeared in otherwise legitimate network traffic, which was then dropped.

In the field of computer security, honeytokens are honeypots that are not computer systems. Their value lies not in their use, but in their abuse. As such, they are a generalization of such ideas as the honeypot and the canary values often used in stack protection schemes. Honeytokens do not necessarily prevent any tampering with the data, but instead give the administrator a further measure of confidence in the data integrity.

The term was first coined by Augusto Paes de Barros in 2003.

== Uses == 
Honeytokens can exist in many forms, from a dead, fake account to a database entry that would only be selected by malicious queries, making the concept ideally suited to ensuring data integrity. A particular example of a honeytoken is a fake email address used to track if a mailing list has been stolen.

<doc id="1088087" wikidata="Q1372616" url="?curid=1088087" title="Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany">
<text>Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany (7 August 1485), was a Scottish prince and the second surviving son of King James II of Scotland. He fell out with his older brother, King James III, and fled to France, where he unsuccessfully sought help. In 1482 he invaded Scotland with the army of King Edward IV of England and assumed control of the country. Scottish lords turned against him in 1483 and he fled after King Edward died. The second invasion, in 1484, was not supported by the new English king, King Richard III, and failed. He died in a duel with Louis XII of France, Duke of Orléans, by a splinter from Louis&#x27;s lance.

== Rise ==

Alexander was the second surviving son of King James II of Scotland and his wife, Mary of Gueldres. Created Duke of Albany before 1458, Alexander also received the earldom of March, and lordships of Annandale and the Isle of Man. In 1460 he travelled to the continent, and to Guelders, the land of his maternal family. On his return in 1464 he was captured by the English. He was soon released, and as he matured began to take part in the government and defence of Scotland, being appointed in quick succession Lord High Admiral of Scotland and Warden of the Marches. Some of his actions on the marches aroused suspicion, suggesting sharp practice and a policy of border violence and truce breaking against England that contravened the 1474 marriage alliance of his brother King James III.

==Struggle with his brother==

In 1479, the seat of Albany&#x27;s earldom of March was seized, although accounts of his imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle at this time appear to be misdated. Albany fled by sea to Paris where in September 1479 he was welcomed by King Louis XI, and received royal favour by his marriage to Anne de la Tour. Louis, however, would not assist him to attack his brother the king, and crossing to England he made a treaty with King Edward IV at Fotheringhay in June 1482.

By the Treaty of Fotheringhay, Albany promised to hold Scotland under English suzerainty in return for Edward&#x27;s assistance and to deliver the southern shires into English possession. With the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard III, he marched at the head of one of the largest English armies to be assembled after the Wars of Independence – 20,000 men – to Berwick, which was seized (the last time it would change hands between England and Scotland) and then, with a smaller force, to Edinburgh. Meanwhile James III was seized at Lauder Bridge as he marched to face the invasion, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. It has been suggested that there was a conspiracy between Albany and a group of magnates who had been excluded from power in the 1470s, including the king&#x27;s Stewart half-uncles, the earls of Atholl, Buchan and the bishop-elect of Moray, although evidence is limited. Gloucester, meanwhile, seems to have been satisfied with the seizure of Berwick, and quit Edinburgh on 11 August. At that point the &quot;Lauder Lords&quot; in Edinburgh Castle emerged and began working with Albany to form a new government. By early October Albany was acting lieutenant-general of the realm, had taken the earldom of Mar, and had re-acquired his former lands and offices.

Albany&#x27;s adoption of the earldom of Mar seems to have angered George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, one of the most powerful magnates in the country, who had designs on the earldom himself and came to the parliament of December 1482, at which Albany had hoped to have his lieutenant-generalship confirmed. The king meanwhile managed to persuade a number of the &quot;Lauder Lords&quot; to return to loyalty to him, most notably John Stewart, Lord Darnley, keeper of Edinburgh Castle, Atholl and the bishop of Dunkeld. Subsequently the parliament passed a number of mutually contradictory acts, and Albany fled to Dunbar between Christmas and the new year. On 2 January 1483 Albany made an abortive second attempt to seize the king. Edward IV promised the duke further aid on 11 February, and on 19 March he managed to force the king into a humiliating indenture. With the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483 Albany lost his main source of power and shortly thereafter he fled south, letting an English garrison into Dunbar Castle as he went.

== Last years and death ==

In July 1484, Albany once again invaded Scotland, this time with a small force with the long-exiled James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas. The Battle of Lochmaben ensued, where the invasion was defeated, Douglas was captured, while Albany fled south again. The invasion had no support from Richard III, and failed to find any Scottish support in the former estates of Albany and Douglas. The author of Albany&#x27;s most recent biography claims that there may have been a further attempt to return to Scotland in 1485. The persistent story of Albany&#x27;s escape from Edinburgh castle, usually misdated to 1479 or 1482/3 by chroniclers, instead is claimed to have occurred in 1485. Certainly Albany&#x27;s closest ally and fellow exile James Liddale of Halkerston is found imprisoned awaiting execution at this time, suggesting he had returned to Scotland with Albany, and a chronicle account that claims Albany killed the &quot;laird of Manerston&quot; (a minor but trusted royal official) may be confirmed by Manerston&#x27;s death before 14 October 1485. Albany fled for the last time, again to France, where he was killed shortly afterwards in a duel with the duke of Orléans in Paris, by a splinter from the latter&#x27;s lance. He was buried near the high altar in the Couvent des Célestins. The titles of March and Dunbar were forfeited and annexed to the crown of Scotland.

==Family and children==
Albany&#x27;s first wife was Lady Katherine, daughter of William Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Orkney, who bore him three sons and a daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1478, and its issue was regarded as illegitimate. Their children included:
* Alexander Stewart (before 14779 December 1537), who became bishop of Moray. He left illegitimate issue. 
* Andrew Stewart.

In 1480, Albany married Anne de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, daughter of Bertrand VI, Count of Auvergne and of Boulogne and his wife Louise (daughter of Georges de la Trémoille). They had a son, John (1482–1536), who succeeded as Duke of Albany, and married Anne&#x27;s niece, also Anne de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne.

<text>Bultfontein is a town in the Free State province of South Africa with a total population of about 23,400 people. It is situated in the Tswelopele Local Municipality, about north of Bloemfontein. The town site was laid out in 1873; it had been delayed because of a location dispute which also led to the establishment of Hoopstad to the north-west. The township of Phahameng was established on the outskirts of Bultfontein in the 1970s.
According to the 2011 census, Bultfontein proper has a population of 2,176, while Phahameng has a population of 21,189, giving the urban area a total population of 23,365. Of this population 93% described themselves as Black African, 5.5% as White, and 0.5% as Coloured. 57% spoke Sotho as their home language, 23% spoke Xhosa, 9.5% spoke Tswana and 6% spoke Afrikaans as first language.

Bultfontein has 8 public schools. Two are high schools, three are combined schools, and three are primary schools. The town is 60 km away from Welkom and 80 km away from Bloemfontein. It has several retail stores.

<doc id="1088105" wikidata="Q1788807" url="?curid=1088105" title="Luxembourg War Cross">
<text>The Luxembourg War Cross (, ) is a military decoration of Luxembourg. It was created on 17 April 1945 by the Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. The War Cross recognizes military service and feats of bravery. The medal is often referred to as the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre (French for War Cross) as French is one of Luxembourg&#x27;s three official languages.

Luxembourg bestowed the War Cross on both Luxembourg citizens and members of the Allied Forces for acts of particular bravery or valor during the Liberation of Luxembourg. The War Cross could also be awarded to military units. The Luxembourg War Cross was one of the rarest foreign decorations bestowed on allied troops due to the small number of combat operations that took place in Luxembourg—in contrast to major fighting in places like Belgium, France, and Germany.

== War Cross 1940–1945 ==
The War Cross 1940–1945 was established in April 1945 by Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. This decoration was awarded to members of the armed forces and paramilitary organizations who rendered distinguished service during World War II. Foreigners were also eligible for award.

The medal is a dark bronze cross in the Cross pattée design. The cross is surmounted by a grand ducal crown. On the obverse side it has a large letter &quot;C&quot; surmounted by a crown. The reverse side of it has the date &quot;1940&quot;. The cross has crossed swords between the arms of the cross pointing upward, also made of the dark bronze. The ribbon of the War Cross is Nassau blue, with three stripes of yellow-orange spaced equally from the center. The edges are also yellow-orange.

== War Cross 1951 ==
The War Cross 1951 was instituted in May 1951. This decoration is awarded to those members of Military of Luxembourg and paramilitary organizations who have distinguished themselves through acts of bravery and courage. It may be awarded posthumously. The decoration may also be awarded to foreigners. The War Cross 1951 was established to allow the government of Luxembourg to recognize service in the Korean War, as well as in future conflicts.

The War Cross 1951 appears exactly as the War Cross 1940–1945, with the exception of the reverse. Instead of bearing the date &quot;1940&quot;, that space is occupied by a wreath of oak leaves.

== United States military unit awards ==
The United States Military allows members of those units which have been awarded the decoration wear the blue and yellow-orange ribbon, enclosed within a gold frame. This represents the unit&#x27;s receipt of the award as a streamer in the same colors as the ribbon carried on the unit&#x27;s standard.

<text>Oppède (; ) is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in southeastern France. &quot;Oppidum&quot; is the Latin word for &#x27;fortified town&#x27;.

== History ==

It is in fact two villages: Oppède-le-Vieux (&quot;the old&quot; in French), built against the Petit Luberon and dating back to the 12th century, and Oppède-les-Poulivets (&quot;nice view&quot; in Provençal), today known as &quot;le village&quot;, down in the valley.

The old village, built on a rocky hill, has narrow streets. In winter, the Petit Luberon starts casting its shadow early in the afternoon. Houses beyond the medieval ramparts are dark, humid and tricky to maintain.

From below the village is dominated by the restored church of Notre-Dame-Dalidon and the ruins of the castle.

In the 19th century, the inhabitants had enough and started to move down in the valley, dismantling the roof of their houses to stop paying property taxes.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Oppède-le-Vieux was a ghost village and a new community was officially established in the valley, with larger streets, cosier houses and farmers closer to their fields.

Following the armistice of June 1940, architect Bernard Zehrfuss founded a commune of artists in the old town, a project that attracted French sculptor François Stahly and the writer and artist Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry. The commune proved short-lived. It was the basis for Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s fictionalized account, published in 1946, called &quot;Kingdom of the Rocks&quot;.

==Geography==
The commune is traversed by the river Calavon.

<doc id="1088108" wikidata="Q97623539" url="?curid=1088108" title="Ministry of Sound">
<text>Ministry of Sound or Ministry of Sound Group is a multimedia entertainment business based in London with a nightclub, shared workspace and private members&#x27; club, worldwide events operation, music publishing business and fitness studio.

James Palumbo is the co-founder and former chairman and CEO of the Group. He handed over the day-to-day running of the business to Lohan Presencer in 2008. In 2018, Presencer became chairman.

==Nightclub==

Ministry of Sound began as the idea of Justin Berkmann. Inspired by New York&#x27;s Paradise Garage - which he described as &quot;an amazing club. It had lights, darkness, music, quiet – everything you wanted&quot; As opposed to striking a balance between the typical hallmarks of a live music venue, Ministry of Sound was conceived as an arena purely dedicated to sound. Berkmann stated: &quot;My concept for Ministry was purely this: 100% sound system first, lights second, design third (in that order); the reverse of everyone else&#x27;s idea.&quot; According to him, they spent £500,000 on the club&#x27;s sound system, and the same amount again on soundproofing the club using magnesite: they wanted to be able to turn the sound system up as loud as possible without disturbing the neighbours, and tested it to a volume of 156 decibels without the sound leaking outside. In addition to drawing inspiration from the Paradise Garage, the club borrowed the idea of using changing set designs from another New York City club, Area, with the first being based around &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, Berkmann&#x27;s favourite film.

Berkmann was introduced to James Palumbo, who was working in property finance at the time, by Humphrey Waterhouse to realise the concept. The site, a disused bus garage, is located in Elephant &amp; Castle in Southwark, London. The club opened on 21 September 1991 and has remained in this location since. Having considered &quot;a load of daft names&quot; for the club, including Get Off My Foot and The Ghost and Mrs Chicken, Berkmann came up with Ministry of Sound after walking past the Ministry of Defence Main Building.

With opening sets from American house and garage DJs Larry Levan, David Morales, Roger Sanchez and Tony Humphries, as well as Paul Oakenfold, Ministry of Sound grew as a clubbing venue. According to Berkmann, it managed to empty rival nightclub Tramp for its first six months by drawing its celebrity clientele, before &quot;they stopped coming and it was more about the dance music community&quot;. It now attracts around 300,000 clubbers per year and has hosted sets from popular DJs including: Adam Beyer, DJ Harvey, Dixon, Marshmello, Jozeff and Pete Tong. It has won the IDMA &#x27;World&#x27;s Best Sound System&#x27; award four years in a row - every year they ran the category.

The capacity of The Box (the main room) is 600 people, and there are other smaller rooms within the club. There are three weekly club nights: Fridays feature Lock n Load brand The Gallery which are primarily trance music, whilst Saturdays host a number of club nights which are primarily house music. In 2016, these included Defected, Glitterbox, Rinse FM, Hospitality and Together. On Tuesday the club hosts a student session called Milkshake, established in 2002.

===Threat of closure===
Ministry of Sound&#x27;s existence has been threatened on a number of occasions by nearby redevelopment in Elephant &amp; Castle. The most notable concerned the redevelopment of Eileen House, a tower block opposite the nightclub&#x27;s entrance. From 2009 to 2014, Ministry of Sound fought various public campaigns to save the club from the threat of closure. These culminated in a hearing before then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson at City Hall in November 2013. On 19 December 2013, a legal deal was agreed between Ministry of Sound and the developer Oakmayne to enable Eileen House to be redeveloped without jeopardizing the club&#x27;s future.

=== Dolby Atmos ===
In 2016, Ministry of Sound partnered with Dolby Laboratories to bring surround sound Dolby Atmos to the nightclub, a first in the industry. The Box, Ministry of Sound&#x27;s main room, now boasts a 64-speaker, 22-channel sound system, allowing the artists to control where certain sounds are sent across the space.

== The Ministry ==

The Ministry is a new members club and shared workspace for creative businesses, which opened in 2018 in London. The first building on Borough Road includes four floors of tailored private offices, shared working areas, meeting spaces, soundproof studios, an immersive tech suite, a full-service restaurant, a bar 70 feet in length, an outdoor terrace, a 40-seater cinema and an events space with a diverse events programme.

== Tours ==
Under its Ministry of Sound and Hed Kandi brands, the business hosts approximately 500 international tour events annually across the world. In 2017, the brand featured as part of the stage line-up at festivals including The Ark (cruise ship), Adria Summer Festival and Ultra Europe.

== Fitness ==

The fitness studio (previously the club&#x27;s back-of-house vault where the alcohol was stored) opened in February 2017. The concept takes a club-style sound system and lighting rig and pairs it with a bespoke, instructor-led high intensity interval workout. Classes run from Monday to Sunday, and an on-site bar offers a range of drinks from protein shakes to alcoholic cocktails.

== Music publishing ==
The music publishing business was established in 2015. It is independent of the record label that was acquired by Sony Music, and is headed up by Ben Bodie. The current roster of artists includes Mura Masa, iLL BLU, Will Arcane, KDA and John Calvert.

== Record label==
=== Ownership ===
On 10 August 2016, it was announced that Ministry of Sound&#x27;s A&amp;R and compilations recorded music business had been acquired by Sony Music. Rights to all recordings under the Ministry of Sound name are now held and mostly distributed by Sony Music (excluding London Grammar catalogue which is distributed by Universal Music Group in most of the world and Because Music in France), with the remaining Ministry of Sound businesses retained within the original group.

Ministry of Sound was an independent record label split into two divisions: Artist &amp; Repertoire and Compilations.

===Artist repertoire===
The Artist &amp; Repertoire division was established in the early 1990s with releases on a &#x27;Sound of Ministry&#x27; label imprint. Sound of Ministry was superseded by in-house labels Open, Data, Substance, Smoove and Rulin&#x27;, which between them released a string of UK and international chart hits.

In 2009, the artist labels were consolidated under &#x27;Ministry of Sound Recordings&#x27;. The first artist signed was Example, who achieved two UK number 1 records, three top 10s, two top 20s, two gold albums and one platinum number 1 selling album, &quot;Playing in the Shadows&quot;. Other notable label signings include Wretch 32, DJ Fresh and, more recently, London Grammar, whose debut album &quot;If You Wait&quot; reached platinum sales status in the UK, gold status in France and was number 1 on the iTunes Album Chart in Australia. In 2014, London Grammar were nominated for &#x27;British Breakthrough Act&#x27; at the BRIT Awards. &quot;If You Wait&quot; was also named iTunes &#x27;Album of the Year 2013&#x27;
The artist label also continue to release dance singles, achieving three number 1 records in the UK in 2013 with Bingo Players feat. Far East Movement&#x27;s &quot;Get Up (Rattle)&quot;, Duke Dumont feat. A*M*E&#x27;s &quot;Need U (100%)&quot;, and Storm Queen&#x27;s &quot;Look Right Through&quot;.

===Compilations===
The compilations business was first established in 1993 with the release of &quot;Sessions Volume One&quot;, a compilation album of dance music mixed by Tony Humphries. The album was a commercial success. The business has now sold more than 55 million compilation albums worldwide.

==Radio show==
Ministry of Sound Radio was an online only service broadcasting 24-hours a day from Ministry of Sound&#x27;s offices adjacent to the nightclub.

<text>Terence &quot;Terry&quot; Osborn Ranger (29 November 1929 – 3 January 2015) was a prominent British Africanist, best known as a historian of Zimbabwe. Part of the post-colonial generation of historians, his work spanned the pre- and post-Independence (1980) period in Zimbabwe, from the 1960s to the present. He published and edited dozens of books and wrote hundreds of articles and book chapters, including co-editing &quot;The Invention of Tradition&quot; (1983) with Eric Hobsbawm. He was the Rhodes Professor of Race Relations at the University of Oxford and the first Africanist fellow of the British Academy.

==Biography==
Born in South Norwood, south-east London, Terence Ranger was educated at the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe (1940–42), then Highgate School in north London. As an undergraduate he studied History at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford University, and went on to complete his PhD at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, focusing on 17th-century Ireland, under the supervision of Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper. In 1953 he married Shelagh Campbell Clarke, with whom he had three daughters.

In 1957 he moved to modern-day Zimbabwe, at the time Southern Rhodesia, to take up a lectureship at the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now the University of Zimbabwe) after reading an article by Basil Fletcher, the vice-principal of the university, in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Ranger became interested in African history and developed views that were considered radical by the white government of the time, leading the Rhodesian authorities to restrict his movement to within a three-mile radius of his home. He was deported in 1963 and took up a lectureship at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, where his colleagues included John Lonsdale, John Iliffe and John McCracken. During this time Ranger wrote &quot;Revolt in Southern Rhodesia, 1896–97: A Study in African Resistance&quot; (1967), which showed how Africans lived before the arrival of Cecil Rhodes and his Pioneer Column in 1890 and attempted to explain why the country&#x27;s two main tribes, the Shona and Matabele, rose up against the European settlers, and &quot;The African Voice in Southern Rhodesia&quot; (1970), both of which were influential in the development of African nationalism.

In 1969, Ranger moved to the US to work at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he mostly researched African religion. He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1974 to take up a professorship at the University of Manchester where his research focused on Zimbabwe. In 1980, Ranger founded the Britain Zimbabwe Society with Guy Clutton-Brock, of which he was president (2006–14). During 1980–82 he was President of the African Studies Association of the UK (ASAUK) and from 1981 to 1982 President of the Ecclesiastical History Society. During this time he also published his widely influential work &quot;The Invention of Tradition&quot; (1983) in collaboration with Eric Hobsbawm.

With the change of regime, Ranger was allowed back into Zimbabwe, which allowed him to undertake research for his book &quot;Peasant Consciousness and Guerrilla War&quot;, a comparative account of the ways in which ideas were formed among rural people, which was published in 1985. In 1987, he was appointed Rhodes Professor of Race Relations at Oxford University. In the 1990s he undertook two research projects on the history of the Matabeleland region of Zimbabwe, &quot;Voices from the Rocks&quot; (1999) and &quot;Violence and Memory&quot; (2000), as well as &quot;Are We Not Also Men?&quot; (1995), a biography of the Zimbabwean Samkange dynasty (the most well-known member of which is Stanlake J. W. T. Samkange), drawing on their extraordinary collection of personal papers.

Ranger retired in 1997 but continued as an emeritus fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, and spent time at the University of Zimbabwe, where he undertook research for his book &quot;Bulawayo Burning&quot; (2010), which explores Bulawayo&#x27;s urban cultural history. Upon returning to the UK, he published influential articles on Zimbabwe&#x27;s economic crisis and worked with Zimbabwean refugees coming to the UK, becoming a founding trustee of the charity Asylum Welcome, along with his wife Shelagh, and wrote more than 170 reports addressed to the Home Office regarding asylum cases.

In retirement, Ranger was made a fellow of the Oxford Centre for Mission Studies. In 2013 he published his memoir, entitled &quot;Writing Revolt&quot;. He was the first Africanist fellow of the British Academy and the first historian of Africa to sit on the board of the historical journal &quot;Past &amp; Present&quot;. He died at his home in Oxford on 3 January 2015 at the age of 85.

<doc id="1088143" wikidata="Q4197737" url="?curid=1088143" title="Game balance">
<text>Game balance is a branch of game design with the intention of improving gameplay and user experience by balancing difficulty and fairness. Game balance consists of adjusting rewards, challenges, and/or elements of a game to create the intended player experience.

== Overview and development ==
Game balance is generally understood as introducing a level of fairness for the players. This includes adjusting difficulty, win-loss conditions, game states, economy balancing, and so on to work in tandem with each other. The concept of game balance depends on the game genre. Most game designers agree that game balancing serves towards providing an engaging player experience, especially through a meta.

Game balance is commonly discussed among game designers, some of whom include Ernest Adams, Jeannie Novak, Ian Schreiber, David Sirlin, and Jesse Schell. The topic is also featured in many YouTube channels specializing in game design topics, including Extra Credits, GMTK and Adam Millard.

== Terms specific to game balance ==
=== PvP, PvE and Co-Op Games ===
Player versus player (PvP) describes games that feature a competition between players. PvE is an acronym for player versus environment, where players instead compete with the environment and non-player characters (NPCs).

Co-op is short for &quot;cooperative&quot; and refers to PvE and PvP games where you can work with other players.

=== Game elements ===
Game elements are things that appear within a video game that contribute to the gameplay experience. In most game design frameworks, game elements are categorized into groups to help describe their roles in the games. A game element refers to anything ranging from a player&#x27;s special ability to the relations between different game mechanics in a game.

=== Game mechanics ===
Game mechanics are constructs that let the player interact with the game world. They define the goal, how players can achieve them and how they cannot, and what happens when they try. These would include challenges, competitive or cooperative gameplay, win-loss conditions and states, feedback loops, and how they relate to one another. Like game balance, the terminology behind game mechanics can vary depending on the designer or the resource&#x27;s author.

=== Buffs and nerfs ===
Buffs are changes to a game which increase the utility of game elements, items, environments, mechanics and so on, while nerfs are changes that decrease the utility of said game elements and alike. Buffs and nerfs are common methods for adjusting the challenge for the player. Both can be achieved indirectly by changing other elements and mechanics or introducing new ones. Both terms can also be used as verbs for the act of making such a change. The first established use of the term &quot;nerf&quot; was in &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, as a reference to the Nerf brand of toys due to their soft toy bullets. However, there is no concrete evidence to show where the term &quot;buff&quot; came from. It has been perceived that the term came from bodybuilding culture, where it is a slang term which refers to an individual&#x27;s large musculature as a result of strength-based exercises.

The most popular use of these terms is found in most MMORPGs, where game designers use buffs and nerfs to maintain game balance shortly after introducing a new feature that may cause significant changes to the game&#x27;s mechanics. This is sometimes due to a method of using or acquiring the object that was not considered by the developers. The frequency and scale of nerfing vary widely from game to game, but almost all MMOs have engaged in nerfing at some point.

Nerfs in various online games, such as &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, have spurred in-world protests. Since many items in virtual worlds are sold or traded among players, a nerf may have an outsized impact on the virtual economy. As players respond, the nerf may cause prices to fluctuate before settling down in a different equilibrium. This impact on the economy, along with the original impact of the nerf, can cause large player resentment for even a small change. In particular, in the case of items or abilities which have been nerfed, players can become upset over the perceived wasted efforts in obtaining the now nerfed features. For games where avatars and items represent significant economic value, this may bring up legal issues over the lost value.

=== Overpowered and underpowered ===
The terms “overpowered” (OP) and “underpowered” (UP) are used on game elements and mechanics that are too good or bad to describe a lack of game balance. More precisely, if a game element is too strong even with the lowest possible cost, it is overpowered. If it is too weak even with the highest possible cost, it is underpowered. On the other hand, a game element might simply be too expensive or not expensive enough for the benefit it provides.

Colloquially, overpowered is often used when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games. For something to be deemed overpowered, it is either the best choice in a disproportionate number of situations (marginalizing other choices) and/or excessively hard to counter by the opponent compared to the effort required to use it.

Underpowered often refers to when describing a specific class in an RPG, a specific faction in strategic games, or a specific tactic, ability, weapon or unit in various games as far weaker than average, resulting in it being always one of the worst options to pick in most situations. In such way, it is often marginalized by other choices because it&#x27;s inherently weaker than similar options or it&#x27;s much more easily countered by opponents.

=== Gimp ===

A gimp is a character, character class or character ability that is underpowered in the context of the game (e.g. a close range warrior class equipping a full healing boosting armor set, despite having no healing abilities). Gimped characters lack effectiveness compared to other characters at a similar level of experience. A player may gimp a character by assigning skills and abilities that are inappropriate for the character class, or by developing the character inefficiently. However, this is not always the case, as some characters are purposely &quot;gimped&quot; by the game&#x27;s developers in order to provide an incentive for raising their level, or to give the player an early head-start. An example of this is &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Mystic Knight class, which starts out weak, but is able to become the most powerful class if brought to a very high level. Gimps may also be accidental on the part of the developer, and may require a software patch to balance.

Sometimes, especially in MMORPGs, gimp is used as a synonym for nerf to describe a rule modification that weakens the affected target. Unlike the connotatively neutral term nerf, gimp in this usage often implies that the rule change unfairly disadvantages the target.

=== Revamp ===
A (or &quot;rework&quot;) is a significant change to a game that is designed to improve (or balance out) the game&#x27;s overall quality. This can include changes to the game&#x27;s mechanics, art style, storyline, or any other aspect of the game. Revamps are often done in response to player feedback or to address problems that have been identified with the game. They can also be done simply to refresh the game and keep it feeling fresh for players.

Revamps can happen at any time during a game&#x27;s development or after its release. The difference between a revamp and a remaster is that a remaster is simply an updated version of the game with better graphics and maybe some new content, while a revamp is a completely new game built on the foundation of the original.

Revamps may be optional and may happen if something is not properly nerfed.

== Essential concepts of balancing ==
=== Chance ===

While the optimal ratio between skill and chance are dependent on the target group, the outcome should be more influenced by skill. Chance and skill are viewed as partial opposites. Chance allows a weaker player to beat a stronger one. Generally, it is advised to favor many small random elements with little influence over a few with large effects to make results, that differ highly from average, less likely. The player should also receive a certain degree of information and control over random elements.

=== Difficulty ===
Difficulty is especially important for PvE-games, but has at least some significance for PvP-games regarding the usability of game elements. The perception of the difficulty depends on mechanics and numbers, but also on the players abilities and expectations. The ideal difficulty therefore depends on individual player and should put the player in a state of flow. Consequently, for the development, it can be useful or even necessary to focus on a certain target group. Difficulty should increase throughout the game since players get better and usually unlock more power. Achieving all those goals is problematic since, among other things, skill cannot be measured objectively and testers also get continuously better. In any case, difficulty should be adjustable for or by the player in some way.

=== Dynamic and static balance ===
Game balance can be divided into a dynamic and a static component. Static balance is mostly concerned with a game&#x27;s rules and elements, everything, that is set before a game or match starts. An example would be like player health and ammo left. Dynamic balance conversely describes the balance between players, environment and computer opponents and how it changes throughout the game. An example would be moving objects in a game environment

=== Economies ===
Within a game, everything that has an owner or is provided to a player can be called a resource. This includes commodities, units, tokens, but also information or time, for example. Those resource systems are similar to real economies, especially in regards to trading resources. There are some distinctions for video games though: There are open economies, that receive additional resources, but also closed ones that do not. Additionally, economies might provide indefinite resources, or all players have to share a set amount instead. Especially for online games, it therefore is important to design economies to make them “fun” and sustainable.

=== Fairness ===
A game is fair if all players have roughly the same chance of winning at the start independent of which offered options they choose. This makes fairness especially important for PvP games. Fairness also means, even for PvE games, that the player never feels like the opponents were unbeatable.

==== Early appearances of the term “fairness” ====


Chris Crawford wrote in 1982 of the importance of a game&#x27;s &quot;illusion of winnability&quot;; &quot;Pac-Man&quot; is popular because it &quot;appears winnable to most players, yet is never quite winnable&quot;. When defeated &quot;the player must perceive&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote in 1984, &quot;that failure was the player&#x27;s fault (not the game&#x27;s) but can be corrected by playing better the next time&quot;. The illusion of winnability, Crawford said, &quot;is very difficult to maintain. Some games maintain it for the expert but never achieve it for the beginner; these games intimidate all but the most determined players&quot;, citing &quot;Tempest&quot; as an example.

A fair game is winnable but, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in 1981, can be &quot;complicated or random or &quot;appear&quot; unfair&quot;. Fairness does not necessarily mean that a game is balanced. This is particularly true of action games: Jaime Griesemer, design lead at Bungie, states that &quot;every fight in &quot;Halo&quot; is unfair&quot;. This potential for unfairness creates uncertainty, leading to the tension and excitement that action games seek to deliver. In these cases balancing is instead the management of unfair scenarios, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all of the strategies which the game intends to support are viable. The extent to which those strategies are equal to one another defines the character of the game in question.

Simulation games can be balanced unfairly in order to be true to life. A wargame may cast the player into the role of a general who was defeated by an overwhelming force, and it is common for the abilities of teams in sports games to mirror those of the real-world teams they represent regardless of the implications for players who pick them.

Player perception can also affect the appearance of fairness. Sid Meier stated that he omitted multiplayer alliances in &quot;Civilization&quot; because he found that the computer was almost as good as humans in exploiting them, which caused players to think that the computer was cheating.

=== Meaningful decisions ===
Meaningful decisions are decisions whose alternatives are neither without any effect nor is one alternative clearly the best. This would make, for example, choosing between the numbers of a dice meaningless if 6 always gives the greatest benefit. This example is a dominant strategy, the most damaging type of meaningless decision, since it doesn&#x27;t leave a reason to choose any alternative. Meaningful decisions consequently are a central part of the interactive medium games. Meaningless decisions, also called trivial decisions, do not add anything desirable to a game. They might actually harm the game by unnecessarily making it more complex. Additionally, a higher number of meaningful decisions can also make a game just more complex. Offered decisions should always be meaningful though. However, for the balancing irrelevant decisions might still influence the players experience, e.g. a decision between cosmetic alternatives like skins.

==== Strategies ====
Strategies are specific combinations of actions to achieve a certain goal. Classic examples for this are a rush or focusing on economy in a real-time strategy game. Not only elementary decisions within a strategy, e.g. between game elements, also the decision between strategies should remain meaningful.

==== Dominant strategies ====
A dominant strategy is a strategy that is always the most likely to lead to success, making it objectively the best strategy. This therefore renders all related decisions meaningless. Even if a strategy does not always win, but clearly is the best, it can be called (almost) dominant. Dominant strategies damage games and should strongly be avoided when possible. However, there is no objective border when a slightly better strategy becomes dominant.

=== Metagame ===
Metagame describes a game around the actual game, including discussions, like in forums, interactions between players, e.g. on local tournaments, but also the influence of extrinsic factors like finances. The “Meta”, as it is also called, can act as a self-balancing force, since counters to popular strategies become widely known and lead to players changing their play behavior appropriately. This self-balancing force should not prevent developers from intervening in extreme cases of imbalance though.

=== Positive and negative feedback ===
Positive and negative feedback, also called positive and negative feedback loop, essentially describes game mechanics that reward or punish playing (usually well or bad) with power or the loss of it. Therefore, success leads to more power within a positive loop and therefore accelerates progress further, while a negative loop decreases power or adds additional costs to it. Feedback loops should be implemented carefully to only target the correct player, or otherwise they might determine the outcome too early or achieve nothing but simply delay the end of the game.

Many games become more challenging if the player is successful. For instance, real-time strategy games often feature &quot;upkeep&quot;, a resource tax that scales with the number of units under a player&#x27;s control. Team games which challenge players to invade their opponents&#x27; territory (football, capture the flag) have a negative feedback loop by default: the further a player pushes, the more opponents they are likely to face.

Many games also feature positive feedback loops – where success (for example capturing an enemy territory) leads to greater resources or capabilities, and hence greater scope for further successes (for example further conquests or economic investments). The overall dynamic balance of the game will depend on the comparative strength of positive and negative feedback processes, and therefore decreasing the power of positive feedback processes has the same effect as introducing negative feedback processes. Positive feedback processes may be limited by making capabilities some concave function of a measure of raw success. For example:

# In RPG (role-playing games) using a level structure, the level attained is usually a concave transformation of experience points – as the character becomes more proficient, they can defeat more powerful adversaries, and hence can earn more experience points in a given period of playtime – but conversely more experience points are required to &#x27;level up&#x27;. In this case, the players level and perhaps also power does not improve exponentially, but approximately linearly in playing time.
# In many military strategy games, the conquest of new territory only gives a marginal increase in power – for example the &#x27;home province&#x27; may be exceptionally productive, whereas new territories open to acquisition might only have by comparison slight resources, or may be prone to revolts or public order penalties which reduce their ability to provide significant net resources, after resources are allocated to adequately suppressing revolts. In this case, a player with initially impressive successes may become &#x27;overextended&#x27; attempting to hold may regions which provide only marginal increases in resources.
# In many games there is little or no advantage in acquiring a large horde of some particular item. For example, having a large and varied cache of equipment or weapons is an advantage, but only weakly over a somewhat smaller horde with a similar degree of diversity – for example only one weapon can be used at a time, and having another in an inventory with very similar capabilities offers only marginal gain. In more general terms, capabilities may depend on some bottleneck where there is no or only weak positive feedback.

Strongly net negative feedback loops can lead to frequent ties. Conversely, if there is on net a strong positive feedback loop, early successes can multiply very rapidly, leading to the player eventually attaining a commanding position from which losing is almost impossible.

=== Power and costs ===
Power is everything that provides an advantage, while costs are essentially everything that is a disadvantage. Therefore, power and costs can be viewed as positive and negative values of the same scale. This allows calculations with both of them at the same time. Sometimes, it is only a matter of perspective if something is an advantage or a disadvantage: Is it a benefit to have bonus damage against dragons? Or is it a drawback not to receive it against other targets? A crucial part of game balancing consists in relating power and costs to each other and find a suitable relation in the first place, e.g. a power curve. In addition to that, costs might not be explicitly quantified: Spending gold on something from any finite amount limits future purchases. Also, certain investments might have prerequisites before they even become available. Sometimes, a game does not even show disadvantages. All of this can be referred to as shadow costs.

=== Rewards ===
Every player desires rewards, e.g. new game content or a simple compliment. Rewards should get bigger as the playtime increases. They give a player the feeling of doing something right and can enhance progress. A little bit of uncertainty about rewards makes them more desirable for many players.

=== Solvability ===
Colloquially speaking, solving a game refers to winning it or reaching its end. Ian Schreiber calls a game solvable if, for every situation, there is a recognizable best action. Generally, it is undesirable if a game can easily be solved, since this makes decisions meaningless, and games become boring faster.

There are multiple tiers of solvability: A game might be trivial to solve, but it might also be solvable only in theory with a lot of computing effort. Even games with random elements are solvable since a best action can be found using expected values. Besides high complexity, hidden information and the influence of other human players are what makes it impossible for a human to completely solve a game.

=== Symmetry and asymmetry ===
Symmetric games offer all players identical starting conditions and are therefore automatically fair in the above stated sense. While they are easier to balance, they still must be balanced, e.g. regarding their game elements. Most modern games are asymmetric though, while the grade of asymmetry can vary greatly. Fairness becomes even more important for those.

Giving each player identical resources is the simplest game balancing technique. Most competitive games feature some level of symmetry; some (such as &quot;Pong&quot;) are completely symmetric, but those in which players alternate turns (such as chess) can never achieve total symmetry as one player will always have a first-move advantage or disadvantage.

Symmetry is unappealing in games because both sides can and will use any effective strategy simultaneously, or success depends on a very small advantage such as one pawn in chess. An alternative is to offer symmetry with restrictions. Players in &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Catan&quot; have the same number of territories, but choose them in alternating order; the differing combination of territories causes asymmetry.

Symmetry can be undone by human psychology; the advantage of players wearing red over players wearing blue is a well-documented example of this.

=== Systems and subsystems ===
In general, games can be viewed as systems of numbers and relations that typically consist of multiple subsystems. All numbers within a game only have a meaning in their given context. Subsystems can be dealt with separately and they might even have different balancing goals, but they also influence each other more or less. It is therefore crucial to consider how changes can affect the balance as a whole.

=== Transitivity and intransitivity ===

(In-)transitivity is a term used for logical relations. In games, this usually refers to relations between game elements, e.g. between the element A, B and C: In case of transitivity given A beats B and B beats C, A beats C. This means that A is the best element of those three. A transitive relation is especially useful as rewards for the player to receive more and more useful game elements.

In case of intransitivity given A beats B and B beats C, A does not automatically beat C. On the contrary, it might even be the case that C beats A, like in rock-paper-scissors. Intransitive relations can be assessed within the properties of game elements instead of just defining the outcome. This helps to create variety and prevent dominant strategies.

== Balancing process ==
Balancing always includes changing quantifiable values and relations between them, directly or indirectly; this is done as an iterative process and partially dependent on the genre, during development and also afterwards (e.g. by rule changes, addons or software-updates). However, it cannot be completely solved by algorithms since aesthetics are also important and a perfect balance might actually achieve the opposite of fun. Ideally, simple rules deliver complex results. This is also referred to as “emergence”.

Firstly, a balanced basis should be created, so most later work consists in merely changing numbers and introducing new content becomes much easier. This makes it important for a designer to adjust numbers easily and they should always know how changes affect the overall system. Sight of the bigger picture should never be lost to create a positive experience for the player.

Extremely powerful game elements and dominant strategies are dangerous to the latter goal and should therefore be identified and corrected. Game elements that provide a highly situational use but have a fixed cost value, that is comparable to less situational elements, are particularly difficult to balance. Another priority is providing multiple viable options. Generally, players react better to buffing something than nerfing it. It is possible, however, to achieve those indirectly by changing another part of the system, since most content, if not everything is connected and related to each other.

=== Goals of balancing ===
The highest goal of balancing is always preserving or increasing the fun or engagement. This, however, can highly depend on the individual game and its audience and might even consist in great imbalance or turn into the opposite of fun: Especially in games with in game purchases or in-game advertising, the developer or publisher has an interest to monetize the game, even if it is detrimental to the fun. Such games may frequently interrupt the experience with advertisements or provide low chances (e.g. in loot boxes) to intentionally frustrate the player but keep engagement high to encourage spending money to skip frustrating parts. Otherwise, the player may face huge disadvantages (imbalances) even against other paying players.

In general, though, there is a consensus that huge imbalances are bad for a game, even if the game still is fun to play – a better balance would make it even more fun. Opinions on exactly what should be balanced, how well-balanced a game should ideally be and even if perfect balance is achievable or even a good thing vary. In some cases, it is even stated that a slight imbalance is actually beneficial.

A crucial goal of balancing a is preventing any of its component systems from being ineffective or otherwise undesirable when compared to their peers. An unbalanced system represents wasted development resources at the very least, and at worst can undermine the game&#x27;s entire ruleset by making important roles or tasks impossible to perform.

One balancing approach is to set strategies as the goal, so all offered strategies have roughly equal chances of success. Strategies can only be affected by changing underlying game elements, but the balance between game elements is not the focus here. Strategies should offer a deep gaming experience.

The balance can depend on player skill. Therefore, one level of skill should be chosen as the goal of all development efforts. This might be professional or casual players, for example. On all other levels, that do not fit the prime audience, more imbalances can be accepted.

Preserving strategies and game elements from becoming irrelevant also is emphasized: Every given option should have at least some use and should be viable. To achieve this, strategies and game elements should be compared within all contexts they compete in, e.g. combat or resource investments. Extremely powerful (“broken”) strategies and elements are viewed as especially damaging since they devalue all their competitors.

Beyond all of that, there is an argument for some imbalances within a game, since that constantly encourages players to find new solution, e.g. by interacting in the metagame. This especially applies to frequently updated games. On the opposite end, (nearly) perfectly balanced games would result in mere execution of proven strategies, with only top players being able to create new successful strategies. Also, giving all game elements the exact same amount of power would make all decisions meaningless, since everything is equally powerful anyway.

Another approach emphasizes that balance between game elements, strategies and actions is not the most important factor, but providing counters against any situation that may arise. This always allows players to find them together and they never face unsolvable problems.

At least, there is the idea to include players in the balancing regarding their skills and other prerequisites. Matchmaking and handicaps can help achieving that. This might also decrease the influence of imbalance since players are more equally matched. In addition to that, the players’ perception of balance should be considered: Player behavior can affect success rates of strategies and game elements. Therefore, all changes should be communicated accordingly.

=== Characteristics of a well-balanced game ===
Despite not all goals of balancing are clear, many characteristics of well-balanced games are usually not disagreed on: Decisions should be meaningful. The player should still have a chance to win in most situations and no stalemates should arise, in which nobody can win or lose. Leading player or computer controlled opponents should never get an irretrievable advantage until they almost won. Early mistakes and chance should not make a game unwinnable. Also, the game should provide the player with enough information and control to avoid those errors, so the player always feels responsible for his or her actions.

Measuring the state of balance is another matter though, since it requires interpretation of data. Sheer win rates of strategies or game elements do not have a great significance without considering other factors like player skill and pick rates. Making correct conclusions is therefore crucial to find causes for imbalance.

== Methods and tools ==
The following paragraphs present a collection of tools and methods used to balance a game or to measure its state. Not mathematical perfection, but fun, engagement or a mix of both is the main goal and human evaluation still is the only known measurement for successfully achieving those, especially fun. Also, balancing is an intricate process and typically needs many iterations.

=== Aesthetics and narration ===
The visual impression of a game should not contradict with its balancing. On the contrary: Especially real models, e.g. historic facts, can serve as inspiration for mechanics, counters, orthogonal unit differences or intransitive relations.

=== Balancing strategies ===
One approach is to move the balancing goal to strategies instead of game elements. Strategies typically include multiple elements and decisions. This makes sure that all game elements have at least some use and decisions stay meaningful. Also, seemingly fine game elements might become too powerful only in certain combinations. A difficulty of this is though that strategies can only be influenced by changing the game elements and mechanics they include.

=== Ban ===
Banning certain game elements or strategies is a way to remove dominant strategies from otherwise well-balanced games, especially in the competitive sector. This should be avoided when possible, however.

=== Central resource ===
A chosen value, this may be an attribute of a game elements, costs or an additionally calculated value like power, can be nominated as a benchmark for all other values. Every change of one of them means another one must change as well. It can affect the central resource but also any other value to still fit the same budget.

=== Counter ===
There should be a counter to every action, game element strategy that beats those in a direct competition. This does not only make dominant strategies unlikelier to develop, it also allows players to find new solutions for current challenges. Ideally, a counter relation is assessed within properties of game elements rather than simply defined. Also, decisions that are made at the beginning of a game that cannot be revised by the player should not determine the outcome right away.

=== Difficulty level ===
Video games often allow players to influence their balance by offering a choice of &quot;difficulty levels&quot;. These affect how challenging the game is to play, and usually run on a general scale of &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;hard&quot;. Sometimes, the difficulty is set once for the entirety of a game, while in other games it can be changed freely at any point. Modern games, e.g. &quot;Horizon Zero Dawn&quot;, may also feature a difficulty setting called “Story” for players who want to focus on the narrative rather than interactive parts like combat. There are also other terms. &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, for example, offers two settings above “hard”, called “survivor” and “grounded”.

In addition to altering the game&#x27;s rules, difficulty levels can be used to alter what content is presented to the player. This usually takes the form of adding or removing challenging locations or events, but some games also change their narrative to reward players who play them on higher difficulty levels or end early as punishment for playing on easy. Difficulty selection is not always presented bluntly, particularly in competitive games where all players are affected equally, and the standard &quot;easy/hard&quot; terminology no longer applies. Sometimes veiled language is used (&quot;Mario Kart&quot; offers &quot;CC select&quot;), while at other times there may be an array of granular settings instead of an overarching difficulty option. An alternative approach to difficulty levels is catering to players of all abilities at the same time, a technique that has been called &quot;subjective difficulty&quot;. This requires a game to provide multiple solutions or routes, each offering challenges appropriate to players of different skill levels (&quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;).

=== Feedback ===
While tester feedback is important when developing and updating a game, there are certain things to be kept in mind: Skill and the ability to explain do not necessarily correlate with each other. There are typically more players than developers, so they are better at solving it. Additionally, new testers should be added from time to time since practice effects emerge.

=== Gamemaster ===

A game can be balanced dynamically by a gamemaster who observes players and adjusts the game in response to their actions, emotional state, etc., or even proactively changes the direction of the game to create certain experiences.

Although gamemasters have historically been humans, some videogames now feature artificial intelligence (AI) systems that perform a similar role by monitoring player ability and inferring emotional state from input. Such systems are often referred to as having dynamic difficulty. One notable example is &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; and its sequel &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot;, cooperative games that have the players fight through hordes of zombie-like creatures including unique creatures with special abilities. Both games use an AI Director which not only generates random events but tries to create tension and fear by spawning-in creatures to specific rule sets based on how players are progressing, specifically penalizing players through more difficult challenges for not working together. Research into biofeedback peripherals is set to greatly improve the accuracy of such systems.

=== Game theory ===

Game theory focuses more on theoretical modeling of competing players and their decision making and therefore is only for limited use in game design. However, it does offer knowledge and tools like a Net Payoff Matrix that can be helpful to measure power and understand player reasoning.

=== Handicaps ===

Handicaps may create a competitive situation between players of different skill level, but they might also go too far and render skill irrelevant. Handicaps are disadvantages that sometimes are deliberately self-inflicted.

=== Intuition ===
Games can be complex systems. Since development resources are limited, relying on intuition can sometimes be useful or even necessary. The designer should always keep in mind how changes affect other parts of the game and guesses should always rely on evidence or proof.

=== Matchmaking and ranking ===

An approach to avoid some balancing problems all together is ranking players depending on their skill. Ideally, the ranking system predicts the outcome almost perfectly and every player (in a PvP game) has roughly the same win rate, even considering factors that lie outside the game, like the gaming device. In any case, good match making benefits a game greatly, since, for example, newbies are not matched against experienced players who leave them with no chance of winning and the challenge of stronger opponents rises together with each player&#x27;s skills.

=== Observation ===
Some obvious problems become clear through sheer observation of the game and player behavior. This includes mathematical superiority of game elements or strategies but also extremely high or low usage of those. In any case, statistics do not necessarily represent causalities and that there are typically multiple factors.

=== Orthogonal unit differences ===
Orthogonal unit differences describes properties of game elements that cannot be compared by inherent numbers. Ideally, every game element has at least one unique trait. This also helps creating intransitivity and counters.

=== Pacing ===
Player versus environment games are usually balanced to tread the fine line of regularly challenging players&#x27; abilities without ever producing insurmountable or unfair obstacles. This turns balancing into the management of dramatic structure, generally referred to by game designers as &quot;pacing&quot;. Pacing is also a consideration in competitive games, but the autonomy of players makes it harder to control.

=== Power curve ===
A power curve (also: cost curve) is a relation that reflects the ratio between power and costs. It is especially useful when dealing with multiple game elements that provide varying benefits depending on different values of the same cost, e.g. when using a central resource. While a power curve always shows an order, it does not necessarily represent exact relations, depending on the level of measurement.

=== Randomization ===

Randomization of starting conditions is a technique common in board games, card games, and also experimental research, which fights back against the human tendency to optimize patterns in one&#x27;s favor.

The downside of randomization is that it takes control away from the player, potentially leading to frustration. Methods of overcoming this include giving the player a selection of random results within which they can optimize (&quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;&quot;) and making each game session short enough to encourage multiple attempts in one play session (Klondike, &quot;Strange Adventures in Infinite Space&quot;).

=== Statistical analysis ===
Statistics can help collecting empiric data of player behavior, success rates, etc., to identify unbalanced areas and make corrections. Ideally, a game gathers this data automatically. Statistics can only support a designers‘ abilities and intuition and are therefore only one part of making design decisions, together with, for example, tester- or user feedback. Statistics and their interpretation should also consider factors like skill and pick-rates.

=== Tier list ===

A tier list orders game elements according to their power in multiple categories. This ranking can be achieved using feedback, empiric data or subjective impressions. While the number and names of tiers can vary, a list typically goes from “god tier” through multiple tiers in between to “garbage tier”. While balancing, all elements within the god tier should be nerfed first. Too powerful elements make many other elements worse if not useless. After this, all elements within the garbage tier should be buffed until they are no longer useless. In the end, the power differences between all other tiers can be adjusted until a satisfying state is reached. A tier list is especially useful when working with game elements that have exactly the same cost, e.g. characters in a Fighting game.

<text>Ferron Foisy (born Deborah Foisy on 1 June 1952; known professionally as Ferron) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and poet. In addition to gaining fame as one of Canada&#x27;s most respected songwriters, Ferron, who is openly lesbian, became one of the earliest and most influential lyrical songwriters of the women&#x27;s music circuit, and an important influence on later musicians such as Ani DiFranco, Mary Gauthier and the Indigo Girls. From the mid-eighties on, Ferron&#x27;s songwriting talents have been recognized and appreciated by music critics and broader audiences, with comparisons being made to the writing talents of Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, and Leonard Cohen.

==Early life==
Born in Toronto and raised around Richmond, British Columbia, Canada, she learned to play guitar at age 11, and left home at 15. Ferron attended Total Ed, an alternative high school in Vancouver, B.C., graduating in 1973. Of her earliest musical memories, she wrote, &quot;my mother&#x27;s French Canadian family played music. I heard guitars and banjo and accordion and scrub board and my grandfather clogging. I put it together...music meant fun, meant love and laughter. I started writing songs when I was 10, never saved them after some kids at school found them and teased me about it. I wrote songs and remembered them and when I forgot them I felt they were not important anymore. The next time I saved a song I was 18. It was 1970.&quot; It was with that first saved song that she made her professional debut in 1975, playing the song &quot;Who Loses&quot; at a benefit for the Women&#x27;s Press Gang, a Vancouver-based feminist publishing house.

In 1971, Foisy changed her name to Ferron when one of her friends had a dream in which she was called Ferron, which is loosely translated from French meaning iron and rust. Ferron discovered later in her life that she had Métis ancestry. She said in 2017, &quot;My dream is to die a lesbian, First Nations, Canadian.&quot;

==1970s and 1980s==
While still based in Vancouver, Ferron established her own record label, Lucy Records, and released her self-titled debut album in 1977. The album was recorded in a video studio on two-track equipment, and, as she stated, &quot;the production quality was pretty poor&quot;. Nonetheless, all one thousand copies printed sold quickly.

Shortly after her second album &quot;Backed Up&quot; in 1978, she joined forces with Gayle Scott, who would prove to be her longtime manager, executive producer, and partner in Lucy Records/Penknife Productions, LTD, producing the next two albums and launching concert touring throughout the states. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot; was her first professionally produced album, originally distributed through Holly Near&#x27;s Redwood Records label. &quot;Testimony&quot; brought her much interest in the United States, particularly in the women&#x27;s music community. The title song became something of an anthem for many in the women&#x27;s music community, was notably covered by Sweet Honey in the Rock, and was featured on the second season of &quot;The L Word&quot;, playing dramatically over the closing credits.

Her 1984 album &quot;Shadows on a Dime&quot; received a rating of four stars (out of five) from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, which called Ferron &quot;a culture hero&quot; and the album &quot;cowgirl meets Yeats...a thing of beauty.&quot; &quot;Shadows&quot; earned a place on music critic Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Dean&#x27;s List&quot; for 1984.

==1990s and beyond==
Awarded a Canada Arts Council grant in 1985 to further develop her musicianship, she ended up taking several years off from touring and recording. During this time, she earned some of her living as a carpenter&#x27;s assistant, bartender, and day care worker, before reinvesting in her music career. Ferron returned to the studio and the road in 1990 with &quot;Phantom Center&quot; released by Chameleon Records, and produced by Joe Chiccarelli. The album featured backing vocals by a then relatively unknown Tori Amos, and consequently is highly sought after by collectors. Later, in September 1995, &quot;Phantom Center&quot; would be re-released on EarthBeat! Records with a new recording of the song &quot;Stand Up&quot; backed by the Indigo Girls with their then touring players, bassist Sara Lee and drummer Jerry Marotta.

Between 1992 and 1994, Ferron released three albums on her own Cherrywood Station label (&quot;Not a Still Life&quot; 1992, &quot;Resting with the Question&quot; 1992&quot;, Driver&quot; 1993). The twelve song &quot;Driver&quot; was first licensed by EarthBeat! Records in 1994, and was highly acclaimed by critics as a masterwork and nominated for a Juno Award in 1995. Following this success, Ferron signed to Warner Bros. enabling her to create &quot;Still Riot&quot; in the studio with producer db Benedictson for release in the fall of 1996. During her brief tenure with Warner they released &quot;Driver&quot; as a re-issue, &quot;Phantom Center&quot; as a re-mixed album, and &quot;Still Riot&quot; as Ferron&#x27;s ninth full album project. Initially contracted with Warner for a 7-year, 3-record contract, the deal was terminated early and by 1997 Ferron was back to putting out her own work on the Cherrywood Station label.

In 1996 Ferron received the OUTmusic Award for Lifetime Achievement at the Gay &amp; Lesbian American Music Awards.

For the later half of the nineties, Ferron continued to tour, offer songwriting workshops, and turned her attention back to self-produced projects. As a benefit for the non-profit Institute for Musical Arts (IMA) dedicated to teaching and supporting women and girls in the musical arts, Ferron released &quot;Inside Out&quot; (1999), covering well-known tunes from the 1950s–1970s. She published a handmade book, &quot;THe (h)UNGeR POeMs,&quot; while she was teaching classes at IMA. She gathered some of her earlier, then out-of-print recordings to create &quot;Impressionistic&quot; (2000), a retrospective double album with a 24-page, autobiographical booklet. Her 57-page book, &quot;Catching Holy, Poems 2006–2008&quot; was offered by Nemesis Publishing in 2008.

In 2004 she returned to the very island, in British Columbia, where some of her earliest recorded songs were written, to create &quot;Turning into Beautiful&quot; produced by independent music award-winning Canadian producer db Benedictson. &quot;Turning into Beautiful&quot; reunited the award-winning musicians from the &quot;Driver&quot; and &quot;Still Riot&quot; projects for the release tour. In 2007 she began re-releasing a series of CDs as her Collected Works, and so far &quot;Testimony&quot;, &quot;Driver&quot;, &quot;Shadows on a Dime&quot;, and &quot;Turning into Beautiful&quot; have appeared completely re-jacketed with previously unreleased photographs.

In 2008, Ferron released &quot;Boulder,&quot; produced by admirer/musician turned collaborator Bitch (with JD Samson for one song) on the Short Story Records label. &quot;Boulder&quot; includes guest appearances by Ani DiFranco, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers (Indigo Girls), JD Samson (Le Tigre), Sam Parton (Be Good Tanyas), Tina G (God-des) and Julie Wolf. A CD with live performances, &quot;Girl on a Road&quot; was released in 2011. Bitch produced the newest Ferron CD &quot;Lighten-ing&quot; released in 2013 with the film &quot;Thunder&quot; packaged as a two-disc set.

In addition to her performance career, Ferron has taught master classes in writing in places including Omega Institute, NY, The Rowe Conference Center in Massachusetts, IMA in Bodega, California, and in Provincetown, Massachusetts. She was instrumental in opening up a retreat center near Three Rivers, Michigan called The Fen Peace and Poetry Camp for Women. In 2009 to 2010, Ferron created commissioned textile art—wall hangings, quilts, and pillows—that features her lyrics and poetry. For Ferron, &quot;artistic expression is not only essential, it&#x27;s revolutionary.&quot; &quot;Art is really the expression of the soul,&quot; Ferron says. &quot;I&#x27;m asking women to remember that if we remember our soul, we keep our soul, and we can do it through artistic connections. Art is connected to the soul, and the soul is connected to God, and God is connected to humility, so if you want to take control of a person&#x27;s soul, don&#x27;t let them have art. To me it&#x27;s a revolutionary act to continue keeping your artist soul alive&quot;.

In July 2017, Ferron performed at the 40th annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival at Jericho Beach Park in Vancouver, BC. The Main Stage festival finale was led by Ferron and fellow Canadian singer-songwriter Roy Forbes, with festival artists on stage and the audience singing along to one of Ferron&#x27;s anthems: &quot;Testimony&quot;.

<text>Jumbo is a musical produced by Billy Rose, with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart and book by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur.

==Production==
The musical opened on Broadway at the Hippodrome Theatre on November 16, 1935 and closed on April 18, 1936 after 233 performances. Directed by John Murray Anderson and George Abbott it starred Jimmy Durante, Donald Novis, Gloria Grafton, and featured circus specialty acts. &quot;Jumbo&quot; tells the story of a financially strapped circus. At the end of each performance, Durante lay down on the stage and permitted a live elephant to place its foot upon his head.

The large 5,000-seat theatre was turned into a circus tent where the many specialty acts (including acrobats and animal acts) performed during the show. The music was played by Paul Whiteman and his orchestra.

==Opening night==
The musicians included as follows:
*Paul Samuel Whiteman, leader
*Mischa Russell, concert master
*Matty Malneck, Harry Struble, Bob Lawrence, violins
*Eddie Wade, Harry Goldfield, Charlie Teagarden, trumpets
*Bill Rank, Jack Teagarden, Hal Matthews, trombones
*Bennie Bonacio, Frank Trumbauer, alto saxophones
*John Baptiste Cordaro, Edward Powell, tenor saxophones
*Charlie Strickfaden, baritone saxophone
*Roy Bargy, piano
*Michael Pingitore, banjo
*Artie Miller, bass
*Norman McPherson, tuba
*Larry Gomerdinger, drums and percussion

==Songs==
;Act 1
*Over and Over Again – Mr. Ball and Henderson&#x27;s Razorbacks
*The Circus Is on Parade – Henderson&#x27;s Razorbacks and Artists of the Circus
*The Most Beautiful Girl in the World – Matt Mulligan Jr. and Mickey Considine
*Laugh – Claudius B. Bowers and Circus Specialty
*My Romance – Matt Mulligan Jr. and Mickey Considine
*Little Girl Blue – Mickey Considine

;Act 2
*The Song of the Roustabouts – The Razorbacks
*Women –Claudius B. Bowers, Circus Specialty, Allan K. Foster Girls and Dancers
*Memories of Madison Square Garden (When the Circus Played the Garden) – Ensemble
*Diavolo – Mr. Ball, The Razorbacks and Circus Specialties
*The Circus Wedding – Entire Company and The Menagerie

&quot;Note:&quot;The song &quot;There&#x27;s a Small Hotel&quot;, dropped from the production before it opened, later appeared in the 1936 Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;On Your Toes&quot; and became a standard.

==1962 film==
The musical was made into a movie as &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; in 1962, starring Jimmy Durante, Doris Day, Martha Raye, and Stephen Boyd, featuring Busby Berkeley&#x27;s choreography. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Scoring of Music-Adaptation or Treatment. Although Jimmy Durante was in the cast of both the stage musical and the film (made nearly three decades later), the two productions have very different plots, using much of the same score, and the characters&#x27; names were changed in the film. However, one piece of stage business from the stage musical was repeated in the film: In both versions, Durante is working for a cash-strapped circus when its assets are seized by creditors. Durante attempts to sneak his beloved elephant Jumbo off the circus grounds, only to be confronted by a sheriff, who demands: &quot;Where you going with that elephant?&quot; Caught red-handed, Durante blithely replies &quot;What elephant?&quot;

<doc id="1088184" wikidata="Q672432" url="?curid=1088184" title="Necrophagist">
<text>Necrophagist ( ) was a German technical death metal band founded and fronted by guitarist and vocalist Muhammed Suiçmez. The band used baroque music-influenced compositions paired with extreme metal drumming.

The name originates from the Greek roots νεκρο- &quot;nekro-&quot; (&quot;dead (body)&quot;) and -φαγος &quot;-&quot; (&quot;eater of&quot;). This figuratively translates to &quot;eater of the dead&quot;; literally the &quot;eater of dead bodies&quot;.

== History ==
=== 1999–2004: &quot;Onset of Putrefaction&quot; and &quot;Epitaph&quot; ===
Necrophagist&#x27;s debut album &quot;Onset of Putrefaction&quot; has been out of print for years. The percussion on the album was handled by a drum machine. Eventually, a new edition with drum samples recorded by Hannes Grossmann was created. All of the old guitar, bass guitar and vocal tracks were mixed along with the brand new drum samples. The re-release also features two songs from Necrophagist&#x27;s 1995 self-titled demo tape. The whole album was also engineered by long-time Necrophagist engineer and producer Christoph Brandes at &quot;The Iguana Studios&quot;. It was mastered by Bob Katz at &quot;Digital Domain&quot;, Orlando, Florida. The re-release was issued in 2004 by Willowtip in the United States/Canada and Relapse in the rest of the world. In August 2001, Necrophagist performed at the Brutal Assault open air festival in the Czech Republic. The band also returned to perform in the years 2003, 2005 and 2010.

=== 2004–2008: Touring and continued lineup changes ===
On 10 February 2006, it was announced that Christian Münzner had departed the band due to scheduling conflicts. Later on, he joined the death metal band Obscura. A replacement guitarist was found, Sami Raatikainen, who is from Helsinki, Finland. Sami also plays in the band Codeon.

In 2006, the band undertook an American tour called &quot;Carving North America&#x27;s Epitaph&quot;. Necrophagist was joined on this tour by Arsis, Alarum, Neuraxis, Ion Dissonance, Cattle Decapitation and Thine Eyes Bleed. They, along with Dying Fetus, supported Cannibal Corpse on their U.S. tour in the fall, which also included some Canadian venues.

In 2007, the band announced on its Myspace profile that after the 2007 California Metalfest, drummer Hannes Grossmann would leave the band. Hannes stated that he was unable to commit to the band&#x27;s full-time touring schedule. Marco Minnemann (who has played with Paul Gilbert, Terry Bozzio, Chad Wackerman) was the official permanent replacement for Hannes.

Necrophagist was a headlining act for The Summer Slaughter Tour in 2007, which featured a wide variety of other extreme metal bands including Decapitated, Arsis, The Faceless, Cephalic Carnage, As Blood Runs Black and Cattle Decapitation.

In April 2008, Necrophagist announced that Romain Goulon would be joining the band as their new drummer, replacing Minnemann, who would still be working with Suiçmez on a side project.

Necrophagist played in the &quot;Pillage the Village Tour&quot; in 2008 from 26 August 2008 to 10 September 2008 with death metal bands Dying Fetus and Beneath the Massacre. Shows in some areas also included Carcass, Suffocation, 1349 and Aborted.

=== 2008–present: Hiatus ===
In 2008, Necrophagist began work on its next album with new drummer Romain Goulon. According to rumours, two possible names were &quot;The Path to Naught&quot; and &quot;Death to the Faithful&quot;. Suiçmez stated that the band would be using seven-string guitars on the album. Muhammed himself will be recording with a new custom shop Ibanez Xiphos guitar with seven strings, as well as 27 frets. Sami Raatikainen is an Ibanez guitar endorser, using a 7 String RG-Series guitar on stage.

As of 2012, it was unknown if Necrophagist were still active, or had plans to release a follow-up to &quot;Epitaph&quot;. This had led to a large amount of speculation on the part of fans, bewildered by the album&#x27;s long wait. However, in a statement made in August 2012, former drummer Marco Minnemann stated there was indeed progress on a new album, saying &quot;I know people are waiting for the new Necro album so bad. Muhammed is a very close friend of mine and I know he&#x27;s really concerned about delivering the best album possible. But I personally know there&#x27;s progress...hang on in there, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll deliver the goods.&quot;

On 11 September 2013, drummer Romain Goulon issued a statement that Necrophagist were still active and attempting to record a new album, however, there was no indication of when it would be released. Then on 4 April 2016, Goulon replied to a Facebook comment and stated &quot;We&#x27;re looking for a coffin to mourn the dead&quot;, saying that Necrophagist would not be moving forward as a band, and thus were done.

<text>The New Games Book and its companion, More New Games, were resources developed for the &quot;New Games&quot; movement which began in the late 1960s to encourage people to play non-competitive or friendlier games. Many of the &quot;New Games&quot; may now be seen played, in their modern variants, in church youth groups, summer camps, gym classes, theatre workshops and as team-building exercises for organizations. 

The New Games movement was initiated by Rose (Pat) Farrington, who helped to organize the first &quot;New Games Tournament&quot; at Gerbode Preserve in October 1973. The Tournament was funded by The Point Foundation.

The success of this tournament led to the creation of the New Games Foundation which published &quot;The New Games Book&quot; in 1976 when the Foundation was under the direction of Bernie DeKoven, Burton Naiditch and John O&#x27;Connell. DeKoven was one of the main contributors to the development of the New Games Training program which was key to the dissemination of the New Games concept worldwide. The Foundation ended in 1983.

<doc id="1088194" wikidata="Q5513891" url="?curid=1088194" title="Quad 4 engine">
<text>The Quad 4 is a family of straight-four engines produced by General Motors&#x27; Oldsmobile division. Several double overhead camshaft (DOHC) versions were produced between 1987 and 2002, and one single overhead camshaft (SOHC) model was built from 1992 to 1994. 

==History==
The Quad 4 is the first domestic regular production DOHC four-cylinder engine wholly designed and built by GM, the only similar prior example being the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega, whose DOHC head was designed by Cosworth in England. In addition to the 2.3-liter DOHC Quad 4s, there was also a short-lived 2.3-liter SOHC variant called the &quot;Quad OHC&quot;, available from 1992 to 1994, and the 2.4-liter Twin Cam, available from 1996 to 2002.

The Quad 4 was originally expected to debut in 1987, but was delayed for one year. From as early as 1988, Oldsmobile announced that a high-output &quot;HO&quot; Quad 4 with was forthcoming.

All Quad 4 family engines were produced at the Lansing Engine Plant (plant five) in Delta Township near Lansing, Michigan. The Twin Cam was the last engine that was engineered and produced solely by Oldsmobile; the Aurora V8 and Shortstar V6 were based on the Cadillac Northstar V8 architecture.

First released to the public as a regular production option for the 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and Pontiac Grand Am, the engine&#x27;s availability expanded to Buick in late 1988 and Chevrolet in 1990, after which it became a mainstay in GM&#x27;s lineup.

The Quad 4 underwent two rounds of exhaust port size reductions, followed by the addition of balance shafts in 1995 to address its levels of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). Further changes were made for the 1996 model year when the engine&#x27;s bore and stroke were changed, and the engine was subsequently renamed the &quot;Twin Cam&quot;.

The Quad 4 engine lineup was cancelled after the 2002 model year. It was replaced by the Ecotec for the 2003 model year.

==Common features==
The Quad 4 name is derived from the engine&#x27;s four-cylinder, four valve-per-cylinder layout. The engine has a cast iron block. The head, camshaft carriers, and timing chain cover are aluminum, and the sump is die-cast aluminum.

Although cogged timing belts were becoming popular among contemporary overhead cam designs, the Quad 4 uses timing chains to drive both camshafts, as well as the water pump. Engine accessories are driven by a single-plane serpentine belt.

Fuel is delivered by an electronic fuel injection system, and spark is produced by a distributorless ignition system called &quot;direct-fire&quot;, that alternately fires two ignition coils located under the cast aluminum engine cover.

==Reception==
Following the engine&#x27;s release in 1988, Oldsmobile promoted the Quad 4 name with cars like the Oldsmobile Aerotech. Although the engines in the Oldsmobile Aerotechs were purpose-built and turbocharged, they were meant to showcase the design&#x27;s capability. At the 1988 Indianapolis 500, the pace car was an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme convertible powered by a turbocharged production Quad 4.

After positive reviews for the first few years of sales, the automotive press began to criticize the Quad 4 for its NVH levels when compared to turbocharged four-cylinders, V6es, and occasionally V8s.

The design gained a minor following in hot rodding circles due to its resemblance to a 1930s Offenhauser engine once the ribbed aluminum cover was removed, exposing the tall cam towers and deep valley between them holding the spark plugs.

==Versions==
=== LD2 ===

The LD2 is the original version of the Quad 4, introduced in 1987 for the 1988 model year. Bore × stroke are , for a displacement of . In base form it put out from 1988 to 1989 and from 1990 to 1992. The naturally aspirated Quad 4 was able to produce that power with a 9.5:1 compression ratio, and was able to meet emission standards without using an EGR system. 

Minor running changes to the base Quad 4 included different crankshafts, cams, and manifolds, all meant to increase torque and reduce NVH. 

A slightly augmented version of the LD2 was offered in some Oldsmobile Achieva models with the SC (and possibly SL) trim packages. In this application the LD2 engine had a device called a vortex valve installed in the throttle body, and a ram-air cold-air intake was installed near the driver&#x27;s side headlamp with ducting to direct the air to the engine intake. While some references rate this engine at 180 hp, Oldsmobile&#x27;s own literature reports a number of .

Applications:
* 1988–1991 Buick Skylark
* 1992–1994 Oldsmobile Achieva
* 1988–1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais
* 1990–1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme
* 1988–1994 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1990–1991 Pontiac Grand Prix
* 1993–1997 Pontiac Trans Sport (Europe only)

==== 1995 ====

For 1995 only, a balance shaft-equipped version of the 2.3-liter engine was produced. This arrangement ensures a constant load on the shafts: the crank drives one shaft, which drives the second, which then drives the oil pump. The shafts spin at twice the engine rpm, forcing the redline to be reduced from 6800 to 6500 rpm. Output is and . This was the only Quad 4 produced in 1995, and was known as a transitional year for the engine family.

Applications:
* 1995 Pontiac Sunfire GT
* 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24
* 1995 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva
* 1995 Buick Skylark
=== LG0 ===
The &quot;high output&quot; 2.3-liter LG0 was rated at from 1989 to 1992, in 1993 and in 1994. Both the 1993 and 1994 power reductions were a direct result of the first two rounds of exhaust port size reductions for NVH control. The LG0 is differentiated from the LD2 engine by aggressive camshafts and an extra half point of compression; 9.5:1 to 10.0:1. Premium fuel with a 91 octane rating or higher was recommended for these engines due to the compression ratio.

The LG0 was introduced with special production runs of 200 Cutlass Calais International Series coupes, and 200 Grand Am SE coupes, all featuring bright red paint and gray interiors. It was only available when paired with the heavy-duty Getrag-designed HM-282/NVG-T550 five-speed manual transmission.

A limited production version of the LG0 engine was offered in select Oldsmobiles with the designation &quot;W41&quot; (listed below).

LG0 applications:
* 1990–1993 Chevrolet Beretta GTZ
* 1994 Chevrolet Beretta Z26
* 1989–1991 Pontiac Grand Am SE
* 1990–1991 Pontiac Grand Am LE with the &quot;sport performance package&quot; (RPO: W32)
* 1992–1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT
* 1989–1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais International Series
* 1990–1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais Quad 442
* 1992–1994 Oldsmobile Achieva SC
* 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme International Series

==== W41 ====

The W41 was the most powerful Quad 4. The 1991–1992 W41s were rated at , while the 1993 W41 was rated at as a result of the first round of exhaust port size reduction to improve emissions and other changes to the Quad 4 architecture to reduce NVH. The additional came from longer duration cams and a different PROM.

Part of the W41 drivetrain was a specific version of the HM-282/NVG-T550 with a gear set otherwise unavailable. All W41 five-speed transmissions had a final drive ratio (FDR) of 3.94:1 whereas the 1988–1992½ LD2 and LG0 transmissions all used a 3.61:1 FDR; the 3.94:1 FDR was used on all 1992½–1994 LG0 transmissions, but retained the standard HM-282/NVG-T550 gear set.

W41 applications:
* 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais
* 1992–1993 Oldsmobile Achieva SCX
=== L40 ===

This SOHC variant of the Quad 4 was intended to replace the Pontiac 2.5 L Tech IV OHV &quot;Iron Duke&quot; engine. Debuting in 1992 and called the Quad OHC, this eight-valve engine produced , less than the Quad 4s of the same era. Torque was . Power dropped to in 1993 with an attempt by GM to reduce the NVH of the engine.

Although power and fuel economy were better than the Tech IV, the Quad OHC was retired after 1994 when the DOHC version became standard.

Applications:
* 1992–1994 Oldsmobile Achieva
* 1992–1994 Pontiac Grand Am
* 1992–1994 Buick Skylark
=== LD9 ===

The LD9 Twin Cam was a 2.4-liter Quad 4 variant which debuted in 1996 with balance shafts and a redesigned cylinder head. In the mid-1990s, these engines, like their earlier 2.3-liter counterparts, were known for timing chain failures, as well as water pump failures, in which the water pumps were often difficult and costly to access and replace. LD9s also had very small oil passages, making for less than adequate lubrication, and costly engine repairs if not maintained properly. Bore was decreased from and stroke increased from for better torque. Power came in at . This engine received a minor update halfway through the 1999 model year that eliminated the exhaust gas recirculation, increased the compression ratio from 9.5:1 to 9.7:1, and switched from low impedance fuel injectors to high impedance. For increased reliability this engine also saw other minor updates in the 2000s towards the end of its use in General Motors vehicles. In 2001, changes included a smaller knock sensor, flat-top pistons instead of dished, new oiling passages, newer stronger timing chain, a redesigned water pump, a redesigned starter motor, and a higher capacity catalytic converter. An improved belt-tensioner was introduced in 2002.

==Prototypes and experimental engines==
===Factory prototypes===
At the same time that Oldsmobile announced the planned high-output &quot;HO&quot; Quad 4 in 1988, they suggested that a turbocharged version producing up to was planned. A turbocharged Quad 4 with a reported was installed in an Oldsmobile 98 that was previewed by MotorWeek. A turbocharged Quad 4 was never released as a production option.

The pace car for the 1988 Indianapolis 500 was an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme that had been converted into an open car by Cars and Concepts. The engine was a turbocharged 2.3-liter Quad 4 built mainly with factory parts that produced at 6400 rpm.

The Oldsmobile Aerotech II and Aerotech III were both released in 1989. The Aerotech II is a wagon-back sports coupe concept with a 2.3-liter Quad 4 making with some form of forced induction. The Aerotech III is essentially a preview of the 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan, and came with a supercharged 2.3-litre Quad 4 that developed .

===Aerotech engines===
Even before the production Quad 4 was released, Oldsmobile engineering&#x27;s Chief Engineer Ted Louckes and Future Systems and Technology engineer Bill Porterfield had begun a program looking for more power and higher efficiency from the engine. Part of the project included building the Oldsmobile Aerotechs in pursuit of new land speed records. Two new twin-cam four-cylinder engines were built, based not on production Quad 4 parts, but on a set of engineering parameters derived from the engine, which Oldsmobile referred to as the &quot;production architecture.&quot; Under this scheme the derivative engines had to keep the Quad 4&#x27;s four-stroke combustion cycle, double overhead cams, multi-valve cylinder head and, significantly, bore spacing.

====Batten RE engine====

The Batten RE engine was designed by Rudy Sayn and Andy Schwartz of Batten Heads in Detroit, and followed the restrictions set out by Oldsmobile. The engine&#x27;s cylinder head, block, and sump are all of aluminum alloy, with the sump also able to handle structural loads. The RE also has an unusual coolant distribution manifold. The RE&#x27;s designers retained the valve angles and sizes, pent-roof combustion chambers, dual chain-driven camshafts, and stock piston crown shapes of the production Quad 4.

The RE is a wet sleeve design, with four cast iron cylinder liners attached to an upper cylinder block deck plate. With a bore of and a stroke of , the engine displaced .

The electronic fuel injection system came from Rochester Products, while Delco Electronics provided the engine&#x27;s high-voltage ignition system. The RE was fitted with a single turbocharger from Garrett AiResearch.

Output estimates for the Batten RE engine range from . A Batten RE engine powered the short-tail Aerotech car.

Applications:
Oldsmobile Aerotech short-tail

====Feuling BE engine====

In Ventura, California, Feuling Engineering undertook development of an experimental engine subject to the same set of restrictions set by Oldsmobile. Feuling&#x27;s design focused on thermal efficiency and heat rejection. Like the Batten engine, Feuling&#x27;s BE is an all-aluminum design, with an alloy sump able to handle structural loads. The Feuling block was developed by Keith Black Racing Engines, who produced a Y-block with deep skirts. This engine was also linered — in this case by a set of aluminum/Nikasil liners courtesy of Mahle.

The engine&#x27;s camshaft profiles were the result of a collaboration between Feuling, Engle Manufacturing Company, and Dick Jones Camshafts. In the BE, the camshafts are driven by timing belts rather than chains. Each intake and exhaust valve has its own external port. External manifolding connects each exhaust port to one of two different turbochargers.

Feuling later used a similar cylinder head design on what is reported to be a Cosworth block to create a Feuling/Oldsmobile V8 engine intended for Indianapolis. This was a different engine than Oldsmobile&#x27;s own Aurora IMSA/IRL racing V8.

Output of the Feuling BE engine is estimated to have been approximately . It was used in the long-tail Aerotech car.

Applications:
Oldsmobile Aerotech long-tail

===Quad 8===
In an episode of MotorWeek from early 1988, a photo is shown of an Oldsmobile V8 engine developed using Quad 4 technology. The engine is called the Quad 8. What was shown was apparently a mock-up of the engine, possibly built by Feuling Engineering. The engine made an appearance at a Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show in Las Vegas, but did not go into production. The Quad 8 was featured in an article in the June 1993 issue of American Rodder magazine.

<doc id="1088204" wikidata="Q1481469" url="?curid=1088204" title="Rockin' into the Night">
<text>Rockin&#x27; into the Night is the third studio album by the Southern rock band 38 Special, released in 1979.

The title track, written by three members of Survivor, became the band&#x27;s first big hit (peaking at #43 during a nine-week run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart), and marked the first of many songs Jim Peterik would write for and with the band.

&quot;Money Honey&quot; is a cover of a 1953 song by Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; noted that parts of the album &quot;slip into a dense, wallowing series of undistinguished rock tunes.&quot;

<text>The General Motors L platform (commonly called the L-body or L car) was a front-wheel-drive compact car automotive platform that was produced from 1987 through 1996.

The L platform was very similar to the GM N platform; however, the first-generation N-cars were engineered by Oldsmobile, while the L-cars were engineered by Chevrolet. The L platform used a twist-beam rear suspension and MacPherson struts in the front and featured a wheelbase. Both platforms were used to replace the GM X platform on which the Citation, among others, were based. GM also used a different L platform for the all-wheel-drive versions of the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari mid-size vans.

==Canadian Pontiac Tempest==
Pontiac sold its own version of the L-body in Canada only. It was marketed as the Tempest from 1987 to 1991. This model featured a unique grill and tail lamps (which were later used on the updated Corsica). This model was dropped after 1991, being replaced by the new 1992 Grand Am sedan. 

The L-car lasted just one generation, with the nameplates being retired and replaced by the N-body Chevrolet Malibu.

This platform was the basis for the following vehicles:
* 1987–1996 Chevrolet Beretta
* 1987–1996 Chevrolet Corsica
* 1987–1991 Pontiac Tempest (Canada)

<text>The Long Patrol is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1997. It is the tenth book published and the twelfth chronologically in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series, and it was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

==Plot summary==

Tamello De Fformelo Tussock (or Tammo), a young hare who lives at Camp Tussock, longs to be part of the Long Patrol at Salamandastron. However, his father, Cornspurrey De Fformelo Tussock, will not hear of it. He believes that his son is too young to join up.

Against her husband&#x27;s wishes, Tammo&#x27;s mother, Mem Divinia, prepares for him to leave during the night with Russa Nodrey, a wandering squirrel who is a friend of the family. The two then set off to find the Long Patrol. Along the way, they encounter the ferrets Skulka and Gromal. They do eventually meet up with the Long Patrol, but Russa is killed saving a baby badger, who is named Russano by one of the hares, Rockjaw Grang, in Russa&#x27;s honour.

Meanwhile, Gormad Tunn, the rat leader of the Rapscallion army has been dying from mortal wounds. The Rapscallions are in fear of Cregga Rose Eyes, the ruler of Salamandastron. Tunn&#x27;s two sons, Byral Fleetclaw and Damug Warfang, fight to the death to determine who will be the new commander of the Rapscallions. Damug kills Byral through treachery and takes over control of the army, which he commands to move inland.

At Redwall Abbey, the inhabitants discover that the south wall is mysteriously sinking into the ground. Foremole Diggum and his crew believe the best thing to do is to knock the wall down and re-build it. During the night, a storm brings a tree down on the wall, making the moles&#x27; job easier but also leaving the Abbey open to attack. The broken wall reveals a well, which turns out to be part of the ancient castle Kotir. Abbess Tansy, Friar Butty, Shad the Gatekeeper, Giygas, and Craklyn the Recorder investigate below. After a harrowing journey, they find the treasure of Verdauga Greeneyes, the long-dead lord of Kotir.

The Long Patrol goes to Redwall, hoping to inform the denizens about the threat posed by Damug. At the abbey, the spirit of Martin the Warrior appears to Tammo, instructing him to go in the company of the hare Midge Manycoats to Damug&#x27;s camp. Disguised as a vermin seer, Midge advises Damug not to attack the vulnerable abbey directly, but suggests an alternate place and time instead, buying the defenders precious time to prepare themselves.

When the hare Rockjaw Grang is killed by the Rapscallions, Cregga&#x27;s dreams direct her to the ridge where Midge has directed the battle to occur. Meanwhile, the Redwallers have gathered all the allies they can find, and with the Long Patrol, they battle a losing effort against the rat hordes. At a crucial point in the battle when it seems Damug has won, Lady Cregga Rose Eyes appears with the rest of the Salamandastron hares. She seizes Damug and strangles him, but he hacks at her face, blinding her in the process. The hares and Redwallers are eventually victorious, and the treasure brought back from Kotir by the Friar Butty is melted down into medals for the creatures that fought in battle. The ridge is named The Ridge of a Thousand after the vermin horde that lost all thousand of their number.

In the end, Tammo marries the beautiful Pasque Valerian, the healer of the Long Patrol, and travels to Salamandastron. Cregga remains at Redwall Abbey as the new Badger Mother, and Russano, later on, journeys to Salamandastron, with Russa&#x27;s hardwood stick as his weapon. He will turn out to be one of the only Badger Lords never to be possessed by the Bloodwrath (the berserker rage Cregga and others suffered from).

<doc id="1088223" wikidata="Q7381202" url="?curid=1088223" title="Russ Ortiz">
<text>Russell Reid Ortiz (born June 5, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Ortiz played for the San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball. He is tall, and weighs 220 pounds.

==Early life==
Russell Reid Ortiz was born on June 5, 1974, in Van Nuys, California. He attended Montclair College Preparatory in Van Nuys, California.

==College career==
Ortiz attended University of Oklahoma. In , he pitched for a Sooners squad that would win the College World Series. In 38 innings, he had three saves and 30 strikeouts. In 1994, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
The right-hander was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 4th round of the June 1995 Major League Baseball draft. He was drafted as a closer, but converted to the starting rotation while in the Giants&#x27; farm system.

===San Francisco Giants (1998–2002)===
On April 2, , Ortiz made his major league debut in relief, collecting four strikeouts over two innings. The rookie bounced all over the Giants pitching staff and between San Francisco and Triple-A Fresno, working in relief, out of the rotation and in the minors as injuries and inconsistency plagued the Giants rotation.

In , Ortiz came into his own and held on to his spot in the Giants&#x27; rotation, jumping on the scene as one of the National League&#x27;s premier starters. His 18 wins was good for a tie of fourth in the NL and was in the top ten in the senior circuit in many other pitching statistics.

 was a tale of two seasons for Ortiz, as he was rocked hard before the All-Star break to a tune of three wins, eight losses and 7.55 ERA falling out of favor with manager Dusty Baker. He allowed ten runs in a game versus the Milwaukee Brewers on May 21, 2000. Despite the ten runs, Ortiz won the game as the Giants outslugged Milwaukee 16–10, making Ortiz the first pitcher since Bob Friend in to allow ten or more runs and still earn a win. Injuries in the second half of the season gave Ortiz the opportunity to redeem himself, and the California native shined. His 10–4 record and 3.22 ERA after the mid-summer classic helped San Francisco into the National League playoffs, and Ortiz started Game 3 of 2000 NLDS versus the New York Mets.

Ortiz returned to form in owning a 17–9 record a solid 3.29 ERA, anchoring the pitching staff for a competitive Giants squad. He also set career highs in innings ( innings) and strikeouts (169).

 would prove to be another good effort on Ortiz&#x27;s part as he and the Giants came within one game of a world championship. Yet again, Ortiz had another stellar second half effort helping the Giants capture the 2002 NL Wild Card. His personal six-game winning streak down the stretch propelled San Francisco into the playoffs and Ortiz captured two more victories (with a 2.19 ERA) over Atlanta in the Division Series. He was not as successful however in the NLCS versus St. Louis surrendering four runs in innings in Game 3 of that series. The World Series versus the Angels also featured two polar opposite games for the starter. The Halos shelled him for seven runs in Game 2 of the World Series, as the Giants went on to lose 11–10. He returned to pitch the pivotal Game 6, and again redeemed himself working innings of two-hit baseball before giving up consecutive singles in the seventh inning. Manager Dusty Baker gave him the game ball when he took him out, assuming they would hold on to a 5–0 lead. The Angels came back to win the game by a final score of 6–5, and went on to win the World Series in seven games.

Years later, Ortiz reflected on the moment of getting the ball from Baker, stating that it was an &quot;honor&quot; getting the ball as a sign of Baker&#x27;s affection for his players, and Ortiz stated that he has it displayed in his office; while he mused that he wish he had not been taken out, he stated that if &quot;You hand it off to those three guys, I guarantee you if there was a chance again, it would’ve gone our way.”

===Atlanta Braves (2003–2004)===
Ortiz landed on the trade block in the 2002 offseason and was dealt to Atlanta for pitchers Damian Moss and Merkin Valdéz on December 17, 2002. United with pitching guru Leo Mazzone, Ortiz put together a spectacular season, going 21–7 with a 3.81 ERA and collecting his only All-Star nod. With Ortiz as staff ace, the Braves won their 12th consecutive NL East title, and Ortiz took fourth place in the NL Cy Young voting. In a demonstration of how far the pitcher had come, Ortiz pitched a 1–0 complete game shutout and knocked in the game&#x27;s only run against the eventual world champion Florida Marlins. Ortiz lost Game 1 of the 2003 NLDS against Chicago however, but once again bounced back to win Game 4 and force a deciding Game 5 that Atlanta would lose.

Ortiz displayed more pitching prowess in helping Atlanta to another division title while collecting a 15–9 record, with a slightly inflated 4.19 ERA. Another stellar late season game came in Montréal on September 4, as Ortiz carried a perfect game into the 6th inning and allowed only two Expos to reach second base in the complete game 9–0 shutout. That improved Ortiz to 5–0 with 1.13 ERA against the Expos in 2004. Still, Ortiz and the Braves could not advance past the first round of the playoffs as he was clobbered by Houston for 5 runs in 3 innings as the Astros advanced.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2005–2006)===
Ortiz was on the move again in , this time to Arizona as the Diamondbacks tried to overhaul their starting rotation and line-up after a 111 loss season the year before. Arizona&#x27;s hefty four-year, $33 million deal lured the righty to the desert. The pitcher who had never spent as much as a day on the disabled list in the previous seven seasons, battled a rib fracture after winning four of his first six games for the D-Backs. When he returned from the disabled list, Ortiz proceeded to lose six straight decisions and ended the year on a 1–9 slide.

 saw another injury (this time to his calf) and more poor pitching performances. On June 13, 2006, Ortiz was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks as he sunk to 0–5 with an ERA of 7.54. The five losses contributed to 1–14 mark from May 2005 to May 2006, and the Diamondbacks simply could not afford to allow Ortiz to work out his issues at the major league level. With nearly $22 million and over two-and-a-half years remaining on the contract, Arizona&#x27;s cut of Ortiz is thought to be the most expensive release in Major League Baseball history.

===Baltimore Orioles (2006)===
On June 25, 2006, the Orioles signed Ortiz to a one-year deal. His first start for Baltimore and in the American League ended in a no decision on July 1 against one of his former clubs, the Atlanta Braves; but by the time the season ended, Ortiz had compiled a record of 0–8 with an ERA of 8.14.

To his credit up to this point, in 251 career games (241 starts) and 1,483.2 IP, Ortiz had 108 career wins to 76 losses, and an overall ERA of 4.28. He also had 1,072 career strikeouts to 773 walks. Ortiz had been a decent batter (for a pitcher) with a .208 lifetime batting average and 96 hits in 462 at-bats. He also had 22 career doubles, 6 career home runs and 44 total RBI. The pitcher also had a solid glove, committing only four errors in over 1,400 innings of work.

===Return to San Francisco Giants (2007)===
Ortiz was picked up by the Giants on January 9, , and signed to a one-year contract for $380,000 to compete in spring training for the fifth starting position in the Giants&#x27; rotation. San Francisco general manager Brian Sabean noted that Ortiz while pitching winter ball in Puerto Rico showed both increased velocity and renewed movement in his pitches and was signed on that basis.

Ortiz won the fifth starter spot with an excellent spring training, posting a 3.00 ERA – over five points lower than his regular season ERA the previous year – in 18 innings pitched. In his second regular start, he posted his first win since 2005, and in his third start, he won again, this time defeating the Diamondbacks, who were still paying Ortiz the large majority of his salary.

However, later in the year, Ortiz was placed on the DL for an inflamed elbow, and when top prospect Tim Lincecum shined in his place, Ortiz was sent to the bullpen after his return. Ortiz was later placed again on the DL for a forearm strain and he returned in early August. On August 21, 2007, Ortiz left a game in the 5th inning after throwing three balls. Ortiz appeared to be suffering from elbow pain. Ortiz had missed 73 games in 2007 before this injury. Ortiz underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire MLB season.

===Houston Astros (2009)===
On January 13, , the Houston Astros signed Ortiz to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. Ortiz won the job as the fifth starter for the Astros with a 3.18 ERA in seven spring training games. Pitching in relief on April 8, 2009, he gave up a three-run home run to Mike Fontenot on his first pitch in an official major league game in almost two years. However, after struggling in his first outing, Ortiz started this season 2–0. After that he went 1–6. He had a record of 3–6 with a 5.57 ERA on July 30, 2009, when he was released by the Astros.

===New York Yankees (2009)===
On August 5, 2009, Ortiz signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. He reported to AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and joined a minor league starting rotation. On August 17, Ortiz opted out of his contract with the Yankees to become a free agent.

===Colorado Rockies (2009)===
On August 22, 2009, Ortiz signed a minor-league deal with the Colorado Rockies and was assigned to the Triple-A affiliate Colorado Springs. After going 0–1 with a 7.07 ERA for Colorado Springs he was released by the Rockies on September 5, 2009.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2010)===
On January 8, 2010, Ortiz signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers with an invite to spring training. After good performances in spring training games, Ortiz was added to the Dodgers Major League roster to start the season. He was 0–1 with a 10.29 ERA in six appearances for the Dodgers and then was designated for assignment on April 18. He chose to decline a minor league assignment and became a free agent. He announced his retirement shortly afterward.

==Personal life==
Ortiz resides in Mesa, Arizona with his wife Stacy, two daughters Grace Elaine and Lilian Reid and son Hudson.

In high school he was a teammate of future major league DH Brad Fullmer. Fullmer&#x27;s Angels faced off against Ortiz&#x27; Giants in the 2002 World Series, and a 7th inning, Game 6 single by Fullmer led to Ortiz&#x27;s exit from the game (despite the Giants being up 5–0 at the time). Anaheim would rally to win the game 6–5 and eventually the World Series four games to three.

He was the creator/owner of 2nd Guy Golf, a clothing company. One-hundred percent of proceeds from sales went to charity, which ran for seven years. He also has served in volunteer work with youth sports such as athletic director and Little League.

<doc id="1088231" wikidata="Q6260693" url="?curid=1088231" title="John Thomson (baseball)">
<text>John Carl Thomson (born October 1, 1973) is an American former starting pitcher who last played for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball. He is a 1991 graduate of Sulphur High School in Sulphur, Louisiana. He went undrafted out of high school and pitched for McNeese State University (Lake Charles, Louisiana) in 1992 and Blinn Junior College (Brenham, Texas) in 1993. The Colorado Rockies selected him in the seventh round of the June 1993 amateur draft and he made his major league debut for the Rockies on May 11, 1997.
2007 is his eleventh major league season. In addition to the Rockies, he has played for the New York Mets, Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves and Kansas City Royals and also pitched in the Toronto Blue Jays organization from April through June 2007. He currently resides in his hometown of Sulphur, LA.

==Colorado Rockies==
Thomson pitched in the Rockies minor league system for the Arizona Rockies of the Arizona Rookie League in 1993, the Asheville Tourists of the low single-A South Atlantic League (1994), the Central Valley Rockies of the advanced single-A California League (1994), the New Haven Ravens of the double-A Eastern League (1995–1996) and the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the triple-A Pacific Coast League (1996–1997).

In his major league debut May 11, 1997, Thomson gave up three runs (only one earned) on five hits in 7 innings with 7 strikeouts and 4 walks in a 3–1 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. He earned his first major league win in a complete game against the Florida Marlins June 1. He remained in the Rockies starting rotation for the rest of 1997, posting seven wins and nine losses with a 4.71 ERA and 106 strikeouts in 166 innings pitched.

Thomson made 26 starts for the Rockies in 1998 and led their starting pitchers with a 4.81 ERA. He missed a month of the season with a blister on his right middle finger that would become a recurring problem for him over the ensuing years.

The 1999 season was a poor one for Thomson. After six appearances (five starts), he was 0–5 with an 11.84 ERA and the Rockies sent him down to triple-A Colorado Springs where he didn&#x27;t fare much better (0-2, 9.45 ERA in five starts). He returned to the Rockies August 14 and was credited with his first win since September 8, 1998, but failed to win another game the rest of the season. He finished 1999 at 1–10 with an 8.04 ERA. After the season, it was discovered that Thomson had a torn labrum (another injury that would recur later in his career). He had shoulder surgery October 12 and a second surgery the following day to repair his blister-prone right middle finger. With the exception of four rehabilitation appearances with the Rockies&#x27; Arizona Rookie League team and the Portland Rockies of the short-season, single-A Northwest League in August and September, he missed the entire 2000 season.

Thomson began 2001 on the disabled list (DL) as he continued rehabilitation of his surgically repaired shoulder. After five rehabilitation starts at Colorado Springs, he was activated May 12 and made three starts for Colorado before returning to the DL just two weeks later on May 26. This time, he made seven rehabilitation starts for the Sky Sox and returned to the Rockies August 2. He got his first win in more than two years August 19 against Florida. Over his final eight starts, he was 4–0 with a 3.36 ERA and for the season, he was 4–5 with a 4.05 ERA. On the final day of the season, he gave up Rickey Henderson&#x27;s 3000th hit.

2002 would be Thomson&#x27;s final season with the Rockies and he returned to his pre-injury form. In his first 11 starts for Colorado, he was 6–3 with a 3.86 ERA. With the Rockies unlikely to compete for a National League playoff spot and Thomson a free agent at the end of the season, he became a target of trade talks as the 
July 31 non-waiver deadline approached. After his final start for Colorado July 23, he was 7–8 with a 4.88 ERA in 21 starts.

==New York Mets==
On July 31, 2002, the Rockies and Mets made a trade deadline deal that sent Thomson and outfielder Mark Little to New York for outfielder Jay Payton, relief pitcher Mark Corey and minor league outfielder Robert Stratton.
He made nine starts for the Mets, going 2–6 with a 4.31 ERA. For the season, he was 9–14 with a 4.71 ERA in 30 starts.

==Texas Rangers==
Thomson was granted free agency after the 2002 season and signed with the Texas Rangers January 3, 2003.
He was 13–14 with the Rangers in 2003 with a 4.85 ERA in 35 starts and 217 innings pitched, leading the team in most statistical categories.

==Atlanta Braves==
Thomson was again granted free agency in October 2003 and signed a two-year contract (including a club option for a third year) with the Atlanta Braves December 9.
He had his best season as a major leaguer in 2004, posting a career-high 14 wins against only eight losses and a career-best 3.72 ERA. He carried this success over into 2005, going 3–2 with a 3.42 ERA over his first eight starts before a finger injury landed him on the DL May 17.
He returned to the Braves August 13, but was unable to consistently regain his early season form and finished 2005 with a 4–6 record and a 4.47 ERA.

In spite of Thomson&#x27;s injury troubles in 2005, the Braves exercised their option to bring him back for a third season in 2006.
He struggled to a 2–6 record and a 4.68 ERA over his first 13 starts and went on the DL with a finger blister following his June 14 start against the Florida Marlins.
He returned for two ineffective starts in July and was placed back on the DL—for the seventh time in his career—July 14 with shoulder stiffness.
An MRI eventually revealed some fraying of his labrum
and he made only one more appearance for the Braves, pitching an inning of relief September 27.

==Toronto Blue Jays==

On January 9, 2007, Thomson signed a one-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays for a base pay of $500,000 plus up to $4,000,000 in bonuses based on the number of starts he made.
The team placed him on the disabled list at the end of spring training with a recurrence of his shoulder injury
and released him June 20 before he ever made an appearance with the major league club.

==Kansas City Royals==
Thomson was signed by Kansas City on June 22, 2007, and replaced the injured Scott Elarton in the Royals&#x27; starting rotation.
He filed for free agency on November 1, 2007.

==Major league and minor league statistics==
==Amateur Golf Career==
On August 29, 2015, Thomson was declared champion of the 35th Annual AI Hesch golf tournament, played at the Wellshire Golf Course in Denver. Colorado.

<text>Antonio Alfonseca (; ; born April 16, 1972) is a Dominican former relief pitcher. He last pitched in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies in . Alfonseca also played for the Florida Marlins (–, ), the Chicago Cubs (–), the Atlanta Braves (), and the Texas Rangers ().

He is known for having an extra digit on each hand and foot.

==Biography==

Alfonseca was originally signed by the Montreal Expos as a non-drafted free agent in July . On December 13, 1993, he was taken by the Florida Marlins from the Montreal Expos in the 1993 expansion draft. He made his debut during the 1997 season, and his rookie campaign saw him win a World Series ring with the Marlins. His best year was in with the Marlins, when he led the National League in saves with 45, and won the National League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year.

At the end of the season, Alfonseca had surgery to repair a herniated disc. Subsequently, the Marlins asked Alfonseca to lose 15 pounds to help to relieve stress on his back. At a weigh-in during spring training, Alfonseca had a confrontation with Dale Torborg, the son of then manager Jeff Torborg, and a former professional wrestler. While the Marlins denied any connection, shortly afterwards, on March 27, 2002, he was traded, along with Matt Clement, to the Chicago Cubs for Julián Tavárez, Ryan Jorgensen, Dontrelle Willis, and minor league pitcher Jose Cueto.

On September 2, 2003, while with the Cubs, Alfonseca was thrown out of a game for bumping an umpire with his stomach. He was subsequently suspended for five games.

After the season, he filed for free agency, and signed back with the Marlins, but in July , he suffered a right elbow injury and missed the rest of the season. He was released by the Marlins, signed with the Rangers, but after another mid-season elbow injury was released by them. He pitched for the Phillies in 2007 and for the Lancaster Barnstormers and Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League from 2009 to 2011.

==Personal life==
His nicknames are (&quot;The Octopus&quot;), &quot;The Dragonslayer&quot;, and &quot;Six-Fingers&quot;. He has six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, a condition known as polydactyly. His grandfather also had this trait. Alfonseca regards it with pride, as a kind of family emblem.

Alfonseca and his wife Rocío have two sons: Antonio, Jr. and Mark Anthony, and two daughters, Jenitza and Asia.

<doc id="1088244" wikidata="Q2350836" url="?curid=1088244" title="Bracket clock">
<text>A bracket clock is a style of antique portable table clock made in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term originated with small weight-driven pendulum clocks (sometimes called &#x27;true bracket clocks&#x27;) that had to be mounted on a bracket on the wall to allow room for their hanging weights. When spring-driven clocks were developed, which didn&#x27;t require hanging weights to power them, they continued to be made in the bracket style. Often they are composed of two matching pieces created as an ensemble: the clock and its small decorative shelf. They are almost always made of wood, often ebony, and often ornamented with ormolu mounts, brass inlay, wood or tortoise shell veneer, or decorative varnish. Since in their day clocks were expensive, and a household would not have one in every room, bracket clocks usually had handles to carry them from room to room.

These clocks were almost always repeaters, that is striking clocks which could be made to repeat the striking of the hours at the pull of a lever or cord. This feature was used before artificial illumination to tell what time it was at night. However, because they were often used in bedrooms where the hourly striking of the bell could disturb sleepers, they either had a knob to silence the hourly striking, or did not strike on the hour at all but only at the pull of the cord. These were called &#x27;silent pull repeaters&#x27;.

<text>The Chevrolet Beretta is a coupé that was produced by Chevrolet from 1987 until 1996. Alongside the four-door Chevrolet Corsica, the Beretta served as the successor to the Chevrolet Citation. Slotted between the Cavalier and Lumina/Monte Carlo coupes, the Beretta was distinguished by its vertical door handles mounted on the B-pillar, a design feature later used by the Chevrolet Lumina coupe and its GM W-body counterparts.

The Beretta shared the front-wheel drive GM L platform with the Corsica; replacing the X-body platform, the L-body was designed by Chevrolet, with the rest of General Motors using the Oldsmobile-designed N-body. The body was designed in the same design studio as the contemporary Camaro and Corvette. For 1990, a Beretta convertible conversion was selected as the Indianapolis 500 pace car; though a replica was initially considered as a convertible, the production replica was offered as a coupe.

During its production, the Beretta was assembled alongside the Corsica and Pontiac Tempest sedans (the latter sold only in Canada) in GM facilities in Wilmington, Delaware, and Linden, New Jersey.

==Models and changes==
Base model Berettas were equipped with the same powertrain as the Chevrolet Cavalier, the 2.2 L OHV 4-cylinder engine and the 3-speed automatic transmission by default, or the 60-degree V6. A 5-speed manual was available only by special order if paired with the 2.2 L OHV, however very few special orders ever took place, and the 3-speed automatic was the default option.
The GT included a 125 hp 2.8-liter V6, which grew to a 3.1 L in 1990, and the Z51 suspension package with 15-inch styled steel wheels and Goodyear Eagle GT tires. Also included was a sport cloth interior and sport steering wheel. The GTU was available from 1988 until the 1990 model year. Beretta GTUs (with the FE7 suspension package) were shipped to Cars and Concepts where they were equipped with 16x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels, custom body kits, a rear spoiler, mirrors, custom trim, and decals. With the FE7 Chevrolet claimed the Beretta GTU would deliver 0.92 g on the skid pad, a claim that most magazines of the day failed to duplicate. GTUs were only available in black, red and white.

The GTZ, which replaced the GTU, took over as the high-performance version of the Beretta. It was produced from 1990 until 1993. It came standard with Oldsmobile&#x27;s 2.3-liter, high output Quad 4 inline-four, which produced and of torque, giving it a 0–60 mph time of 7.6 seconds. Also standard was a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission and GM&#x27;s FE7 performance suspension.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s only complaint was the Quad 4&#x27;s noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and noted it was one of the most raucous engines of its time. Beginning in 1991, the 3.1 L V6 could be had as an option on the GTZ, but it was only available with a 3-speed automatic transmission that increased the 0-to-60 mph time to around 9.0 seconds. The 3.1 L V6 was standard on 1990–1992 GT models and optional for all base models and GTs in 1992. Starting in the 1994 model year, the 3.1 L V6 could only be ordered with an automatic transmission.

The 1991 model year saw major interior updates, including a new dashboard and center console and the addition of a driver&#x27;s side airbag.

In 1994, the GT and GTZ were replaced by the Beretta Z26, which put it squarely between the Cavalier Z24 and Lumina Z34 in Chevrolet&#x27;s lineup. The Z26 had a 0–60 mph time of 8.3 seconds. The 3.1 L V6 was redesigned and became the 3100 V6 and gained 20 hp at 160. The new 3100 V6 was only available with a new 4-speed automatic transmission. The Quad 4 HO lost a total of 10 hp (7 kW) in 1994, its last year of production, down to . The 2.3 L Quad 4 was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission. In 1995, the 3100 V6 lost 5 hp, down to , which also carried on to the 1996 model.

Beretta sales steadily declined every year of production as the market turned away from 2-door models. In 1996, Chevrolet ended production of both the Beretta and Corsica after 10 model years. The Corsica was replaced by the Chevrolet Malibu in 1997. The last Beretta was assembled on July 30, 1996.

==Trademark issue==
General Motors was sued by Fabbrica d&#x27;Armi Pietro Beretta for trademark infringement involving their use of the Beretta name for a car. The suit was settled out of court in 1989; GM and Beretta exchanged symbolic gifts: a Beretta GTU coupe and a pair of Beretta shotguns. General Motors donated US$500,000 to a Beretta-sponsored charity which was also affiliated with the GM Cancer Research Foundation.

==Motorsport==
A Chevrolet Beretta, fitted with a splayed valve, 4.5 liter 90-degree V6 engine, won the Trans Am Series championship in 1990.

<text>A cartel clock is a cartouche shaped clock designed to hang directly on a wall, very commonly executed in fire-gilt bronze (a.k.a. ormolu). The form is a more unified development from a wall-mounted bracket clock standing upon its separate, complementary bracket characteristic of the Régence (1715–23), which continued to be stylish in Paris through the 1740s. In Paris, where the ébéniste&#x27;s wooden contribution to the case and wall bracket, conceived as complements in design, was by degrees overshadowed by gilt-bronze mounts. wholly gilt-bronze bracket clock cases became most common by &quot;ca&quot; 1730. The cartel clock, incorporating clock case and bracket in a single unified organic sculptural conception, was a Rococo invention initiated in Paris. Highly ornate Rococo examples exist, with flowing, asymmetrical and curvilinear designs, the most notable being a series of unified cartel clocks in half a dozen related models, dateable to the 1730s and 40s and attributed (some of them signed) to Charles Cressent.

The style that originated in Paris was used there from &quot;ca&quot; 1730 through the reign of Louis XV. With the return of classicism under Louis XVI, however, cartel clocks fell from favour in Paris, where the domestic clock moved to the mantel. In provincial French cities, and elsewhere on the Continent, cartel clocks were made in the neoclassical style (&quot;illustration, right&quot;) The style was adapted in Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, with the style used for clocks executed in wood and decorated with gold leaf. Such cartel clocks were made into the 19th century. With the &quot;Second Rococo&quot; beginning &quot;ca&quot; 1830, mid-18th century models were revived or imitated.

<doc id="1088262" wikidata="Q19483216" url="?curid=1088262" title="Organizational behavior">
<text>Organizational behavior or organisational behaviour (see spelling differences) is the &quot;study of human behavior in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself&quot;. Organizational behavioral research can be categorized in at least three ways: 
* individuals in organizations (micro-level)
* work groups (meso-level)
* how organizations behave (macro-level)

Chester Barnard recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization. Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior research is &quot;to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life&quot;.

==Relation to industrial and organizational psychology==

Miner (2006) mentioned that &quot;there is a certain arbitrariness&quot; in identifying a &quot;point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline&quot; (p. 56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s. He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add &quot;organizational&quot; to its name until 1970, &quot;long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence&quot; (p. 56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.

==History==

As a multi-disciplinary science, organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines, including sociology, industrial/organizational psychology, and economics.

The Industrial Revolution is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous iron cage metaphor, Max Weber raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution&#x27;s focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of &quot;prison&quot; and &quot;stripped a worker of their individuality&quot;. The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was &quot;an organization that rested on rational-legal principles and maximized technical efficiency.&quot;

A number of organizational behavioral practitioners documented their ideas about management and organization. The best known theories today originate from Henri Fayol, Chester Barnard, and Mary Parker Follet. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation. One of the first management consultants, Frederick Taylor, was a 19th-century engineer who applied an approach known as the scientific management. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method. The scientific method was further refined by Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, who utilized time and motion study to further improve worker efficiency. In the early 20th century the idea of Fordism emerged. Named after automobile mogul Henry Ford, the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor. Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.

In the 1920s, the Hawthorne Works Western Electric factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the Hawthorne Studies. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, Elton Mayo concluded that job performance and the so-called Hawthorne Effect was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content. Following the Hawthorne Studies motivation became a focal point in the Organizational behavioral community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable Organizational behavioral researchers such as: Frederick Herzberg, Abraham Maslow, David McClelland, Victor Vroom, and Douglas McGregor. These theories underline employee motivation, work performance, and job satisfaction.

Herbert Simon&#x27;s &quot;Administrative Behavior&quot; introduced a number of important Organizational behavior concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with Chester Barnard, argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of bounded rationality For example, decision-makers often employ satisficing, the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution. Simon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on organizational decision-making. In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more quantitative and resource dependent. This gave rise to contingency theory, institutional theory, and organizational ecology. Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as anthropology, psychology and sociology.

==Current state of the field==
Research in and the teaching of Organizational behavior primarily takes place in university management departments in colleges of business. Sometimes Organizational Behavioral topics are taught in industrial and organizational psychology graduate programs.

There have been additional developments in Organizational behavior research and practice. Anthropology has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as organizational culture, organizational rituals, and symbolic acts. Leadership studies have also become part of Organizational behavior, although a single unifying theory remains elusive. Organizational behavioral researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization. Some Organizational behavioral researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.

==Research methods used==
A variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.

===Quantitative methods===

Quantitative research allows organizational behavior to be studied/compared through numerical data. A key advantage of quantitative studies is that their efficient examinations of large groups can be studied at lower costs and in less time. This form of research studies more of the broad study.

Statistical methods used in OB research commonly include correlation, analysis of variance, meta-analysis, multilevel modeling, multiple regression, structural equation modeling, and time series analysis

===Computer simulation===
Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior. While there are many uses for computer simulation, most Organizational behavioral researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal cognition and behavior such as the thought processes and behaviors that make up teamwork.

===Qualitative methods===

Qualitative research consists of several methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables.This procedure builds and structure patterns of individual behavior. An advantage of qualitative research is that it provides a clearer picture of an organization. Qualitative methods can range from the content analysis of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Meaning that qualitative research goes more in depth of their studies as opposed to the entirety. Common methods include ethnography, case studies, historical methods, and interviews.

==Topics==

=== Consulting ===
Consultants use principles developed in organizational behavior research to assess clients&#x27; organizational problems and provide high quality services.
A robust framework to analyze the consultant-client relationship is key in the success of any consulting engagement.

===Counterproductive work behavior===

Counterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.

===Decision-making===
Many Organizational behavior researchers embrace the rational planning model. Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (descriptive decision-making).

=== Effects of diversity and inclusion ===
Companies that focus on diversity and inclusion are able to benefit from advantages such as better retention and less intention by staff to quit, increased job satisfaction, lower levels of stress and job withdrawal, higher levels of creativity and innovation, as well as less on-the-job conflict. Diversity, or focusing on differences between individuals and groups is of course important, organizations that have a culture that values the unique perspectives and contributions of all employees, also known as inclusion, may be able to move the needle from not engaged to engaged.

===Employee mistreatment===

There are several types of mistreatments that employees endure in organizations, including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment. Employees in an organization being mistreated also can suffer work withdrawal. Withdrawing from an organization can be in the form of being late, not fully participating in work duties, or looking for a new job. Employees may file grievances in an organization with retrospect to a procedure or policy or mistreatment with human interactions.

====Abusive supervision====
Abusive supervision is the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.

====Bullying====

Although definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual. In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possess (either singly or jointly) more power on any level than the victim.

====Incivility====
Workplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and rude behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of social norms governing appropriate workplace behavior.

====Sexual harassment====

Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.

===Teams===
===Job-related attitudes and emotions===
Organizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job involvement and emotional labor. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision. Organizational commitment represents the extent to which employees feel attached to their organization. Job involvement is the extent to which an individual identifies with their job and considers it a material component of their self-worth. Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.

===Leadership===

There have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are contingency theory, the consideration and initiating structure model, leader-member exchange or LMX theory, path-goal theory, behavioural modification and transformational leadership theory.

Contingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation. The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals). LMX theory focuses on exchange relationships between individual supervisor-subordinate pairs. Path-goal theory is a contingency theory linking appropriate leader style to organizational conditions and subordinate personality. Transformational leadership theory concerns the behaviors leaders engage in that inspire high levels of motivation and performance in followers. The idea of charismatic leadership is part of transformational leadership theory. In behavioural modification, the leader&#x27;s reward power (ability to give or withhold reward and punishment) is the focus and the importance of giving contingent (vs non-contingent) rewards is emphasized.

===Managerial roles===
In the late 1960s Henry Mintzberg, a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.

===Motivation===
Retaining talented and successful employees is a key factor for a company to maintain a competitive advantage. An environment where people can use their talent effectively can help motivate even the most smart, hard-working, difficult individuals. Building great people relies on engagement through motivation and behavioral practices (O&#x27;Reilly, C., and Pfeffer, J., 2000). Baron and Greenberg (2008) wrote that motivation involves &quot;the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal.&quot; There are several different theories of motivation relevant to Organizational Behavior, including equity theory, expectancy theory, Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, incentive theory, organizational justice theory, Herzberg&#x27;s two-factor theory, and Theory X and Theory Y.

=== Types of motivation ===
Intrinsic Motivation- This behavior happens out of the pure thought of an individual’s need. Not as compensation. This behavior is used out of the pure need of self-motivation. It is the need to prove one’s self worth. Extrinsic motivation is triggered by external rewards. Meaning, the need for a reward outside of themselves feeling accomplished. This can be brought to them by a pay raise, bonuses, rewards like gift cards and many other sorts.

=== Public Relations ===
Public relations is the practice of managing the communication between the public and the organization, therefore public relations is also related to organizational behavior.

===National culture===

National culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by Hofstede&#x27;s cultural dimensions theory. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations. These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.

=== Organizational behavior policies ===
Organizational behavior policies inside organizations such as employee dating, are rules that can be applied to employees with fairness. Labor relations, leadership, diversity and inclusion policies, will have more satisfied employees with organizational behavior policies. Policy implications are underutilized in organizations. But the need for implications is important.

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
Organizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.

===Organizational culture===
Organizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth. Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization&#x27;s culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. Edgar Schein developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance and effectiveness.

===Personality===

Personality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, cognition, and emotion in individuals. The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the Big Five personality traits, which refers to five overarching personality traits.

===Occupational stress===
There are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.

===Work–family conflict===

Chester Barnard recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role. Work–family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.

==Organization theory==

Organization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.

===Bureaucracy===

Max Weber argued that bureaucracy involved the application of rational-legal authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization. Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an &quot;up-focused&quot; (to organization&#x27;s board or shareholders) or &quot;in-focused&quot; (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian &quot;ideal types,&quot; and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. Charles Perrow extended Weber&#x27;s work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.

===Economic theories of organization===

At least three theories are relevant here, theory of the firm, transaction cost economics, and agency theory.

===Theories pertaining to organizational structures===

Theories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include complexity theory, French and Raven&#x27;s five bases of power, hybrid organization theory, informal organizational theory, resource dependence theory, and Mintzberg&#x27;s organigraph.

===Institutional theory===

===Systems theory===
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. Organizations are complex, goal-oriented entities. Alexander Bogdanov, an early thinker in the field, developed his tectology, a theory widely considered a precursor of Bertalanffy&#x27;s general systems theory. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. Kurt Lewin, a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term &quot;systems of ideology,&quot; partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology. Niklas Luhmann, a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.

===Organizational ecology===
Organizational ecology models apply concepts from evolutionary theory to the study of populations of organizations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are &#x27;selected&#x27; based on their fit with their operating environment.

===Scientific management===
Scientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of engineering. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.

== Models ==
=== Inputs-Processes-Outputs (IPO) framework ===

==== Inputs ====
Inputs are the variables like personality, group structure, and organization culture that lead to processes. These variables set the stage for what will occur in an organization later.

==== Processes ====
Processes are actions that individuals, groups, and organisations engage in as a result of inputs and that lead to certain outcomes.

==== Outcomes ====
Outcomes are the key variables that you want to explain or predict, and that are affected by some other variables.
=== Inputs-Mediators-Outputs-Inputs (IMOI) framework ===

Adding to the IPO model, the IMOI framework emphasizes that outputs can also become subsequent inputs, creating a cyclical process.

<doc id="1088270" wikidata="Q769124" url="?curid=1088270" title="Frobenius endomorphism">
<text>In commutative algebra and field theory, the Frobenius endomorphism (after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius) is a special endomorphism of commutative rings with prime characteristic , an important class that includes finite fields. The endomorphism maps every element to its -th power. In certain contexts it is an automorphism, but this is not true in general.

==Definition==
Let be a commutative ring with prime characteristic (an integral domain of positive characteristic always has prime characteristic, for example). The Frobenius endomorphism &quot;F&quot; is defined by

:formula_1

for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;. It respects the multiplication of &quot;R&quot;:

:formula_2

and is 1 as well. Moreover, it also respects the addition of . The expression can be expanded using the binomial theorem. Because is prime, it divides but not any for ; it therefore will divide the numerator, but not the denominator, of the explicit formula of the binomial coefficients

:formula_3

if . Therefore, the coefficients of all the terms except and are divisible by , and hence they vanish. Thus

:formula_4

This shows that &quot;F&quot; is a ring homomorphism.

If is a homomorphism of rings of characteristic , then 
:formula_5
If and are the Frobenius endomorphisms of and , then this can be rewritten as:
:formula_6
This means that the Frobenius endomorphism is a natural transformation from the identity functor on the category of characteristic rings to itself.

If the ring is a ring with no nilpotent elements, then the Frobenius endomorphism is injective: means , which by definition means that is nilpotent of order at most . In fact, this is necessary and sufficient, because if is any nilpotent, then one of its powers will be nilpotent of order at most . In particular, if is a field then the Frobenius endomorphism is injective.

The Frobenius morphism is not necessarily surjective, even when is a field. For example, let be the finite field of elements together with a single transcendental element; equivalently, is the field of rational functions with coefficients in . Then the image of does not contain . If it did, then there would be a rational function whose -th power would equal . But the degree of this -th power (the difference between the degrees of its numerator and denominator) is , which is a multiple of . In particular, it can&#x27;t be 1, which is the degree of . This is a contradiction; so is not in the image of .

A field is called &quot;perfect&quot; if either it is of characteristic zero or it is of positive characteristic and its Frobenius endomorphism is an automorphism. For example, all finite fields are perfect.

== Fixed points of the Frobenius endomorphism ==
Consider the finite field . By Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, every element of satisfies . Equivalently, it is a root of the polynomial . The elements of therefore determine roots of this equation, and because this equation has degree it has no more than roots over any extension. In particular, if is an algebraic extension of (such as the algebraic closure or another finite field), then is the fixed field of the Frobenius automorphism of .

Let be a ring of characteristic . If is an integral domain, then by the same reasoning, the fixed points of Frobenius are the elements of the prime field. However, if is not a domain, then may have more than roots; for example, this happens if .

A similar property is enjoyed on the finite field formula_7 by the &quot;n&quot;th iterate of the Frobenius automorphism: Every element of formula_7 is a root of formula_9, so if is an algebraic extension of formula_7 and is the Frobenius automorphism of , then the fixed field of is formula_7. If &quot;R&quot; is a domain that is an formula_7-algebra, then the fixed points of the &quot;n&quot;th iterate of Frobenius are the elements of the image of formula_7.

Iterating the Frobenius map gives a sequence of elements in :
:formula_14
This sequence of iterates is used in defining the Frobenius closure and the tight closure of an ideal.

== As a generator of Galois groups ==
The Galois group of an extension of finite fields is generated by an iterate of the Frobenius automorphism. First, consider the case where the ground field is the prime field . Let be the finite field of elements, where . The Frobenius automorphism of fixes the prime field , so it is an element of the Galois group . In fact, since formula_15 is cyclic with elements,
we know that the Galois group is cyclic and is a generator. The order of is because acts on an element by sending it to , and formula_16 can only have formula_17 many roots, since we are in a field. Every automorphism of is a power of , and the generators are the powers with coprime to .

Now consider the finite field as an extension of , where as above. If , then the Frobenius automorphism of does not fix the ground field , but its th iterate does. The Galois group is cyclic of order and is generated by . It is the subgroup of generated by . The generators of are the powers where is coprime to .

The Frobenius automorphism is not a generator of the absolute Galois group

:formula_18

because this Galois group is isomorphic to the profinite integers

:formula_19

which are not cyclic. However, because the Frobenius automorphism is a generator of the Galois group of every finite extension of , it is a generator of every finite quotient of the absolute Galois group. Consequently, it is a topological generator in the usual Krull topology on the absolute Galois group.

== Frobenius for schemes ==
There are several different ways to define the Frobenius morphism for a scheme. The most fundamental is the absolute Frobenius morphism. However, the absolute Frobenius morphism behaves poorly in the relative situation because it pays no attention to the base scheme. There are several different ways of adapting the Frobenius morphism to the relative situation, each of which is useful in certain situations.
=== The absolute Frobenius morphism ===
Suppose that is a scheme of characteristic . Choose an open affine subset of . The ring is an -algebra, so it admits a Frobenius endomorphism. If is an open affine subset of , then by the naturality of Frobenius, the Frobenius morphism on , when restricted to , is the Frobenius morphism on . Consequently, the Frobenius morphism glues to give an endomorphism of . This endomorphism is called the absolute Frobenius morphism of , denoted . By definition, it is a homeomorphism of with itself. The absolute Frobenius morphism is a natural transformation from the identity functor on the category of -schemes to itself.

If is an -scheme and the Frobenius morphism of is the identity, then the absolute Frobenius morphism is a morphism of -schemes. In general, however, it is not. For example, consider the ring formula_20. Let and both equal with the structure map being the identity. The Frobenius morphism on sends to . It is not a morphism of formula_21-algebras. If it were, then multiplying by an element in formula_21 would commute with applying the Frobenius endomorphism. But this is not true because:
:formula_23
The former is the action of in the formula_21-algebra structure that begins with, and the latter is the action of formula_21 induced by Frobenius. Consequently, the Frobenius morphism on is not a morphism of formula_21-schemes.

The absolute Frobenius morphism is a purely inseparable morphism of degree . Its differential is zero. It preserves products, meaning that for any two schemes and , .

=== Restriction and extension of scalars by Frobenius ===
Suppose that is the structure morphism for an -scheme . The base scheme has a Frobenius morphism &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot;. Composing with &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot; results in an -scheme &quot;X&quot;&quot;F&quot; called the restriction of scalars by Frobenius. The restriction of scalars is actually a functor, because an -morphism induces an -morphism .

For example, consider a ring &quot;A&quot; of characteristic and a finitely presented algebra over &quot;A&quot;:
:formula_27
The action of &quot;A&quot; on &quot;R&quot; is given by:
:formula_28
where α is a multi-index. Let . Then is the affine scheme , but its structure morphism , and hence the action of &quot;A&quot; on &quot;R&quot;, is different:

:formula_29

Because restriction of scalars by Frobenius is simply composition, many properties of are inherited by &quot;X&quot;&quot;F&quot; under appropriate hypotheses on the Frobenius morphism. For example, if and &quot;S&quot;&quot;F&quot; are both finite type, then so is &quot;X&quot;&quot;F&quot;.

The extension of scalars by Frobenius is defined to be:
:formula_30
The projection onto the factor makes an -scheme. If is not clear from the context, then is denoted by . Like restriction of scalars, extension of scalars is a functor: An -morphism determines an -morphism .

As before, consider a ring &quot;A&quot; and a finitely presented algebra &quot;R&quot; over &quot;A&quot;, and again let . Then:
:formula_31
A global section of is of the form:
:formula_32
where &quot;α&quot; is a multi-index and every &quot;a&quot;&quot;iα&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; is an element of &quot;A&quot;. The action of an element &quot;c&quot; of &quot;A&quot; on this section is:
:formula_33
Consequently, is isomorphic to:
:formula_34
where, if:
:formula_35
then:
:formula_36
A similar description holds for arbitrary &quot;A&quot;-algebras &quot;R&quot;.

Because extension of scalars is base change, it preserves limits and coproducts. This implies in particular that if has an algebraic structure defined in terms of finite limits (such as being a group scheme), then so does . Furthermore, being a base change means that extension of scalars preserves properties such as being of finite type, finite presentation, separated, affine, and so on.

Extension of scalars is well-behaved with respect to base change: Given a morphism , there is a natural isomorphism:
:formula_37

=== Relative Frobenius ===
Let be an -scheme with structure morphism . The relative Frobenius morphism of is the morphism:
:formula_38
defined by the universal property of the pullback (see the diagram above):
:formula_39
Because the absolute Frobenius morphism is natural, the relative Frobenius morphism is a morphism of -schemes.

Consider, for example, the &quot;A&quot;-algebra:
:formula_27
We have:
:formula_41
The relative Frobenius morphism is the homomorphism defined by:
:formula_42

Relative Frobenius is compatible with base change in the sense that, under the natural isomorphism of and , we have:
:formula_43

Relative Frobenius is a universal homeomorphism. If is an open immersion, then it is the identity. If is a closed immersion determined by an ideal sheaf &quot;I&quot; of , then is determined by the ideal sheaf and relative Frobenius is the augmentation map .

&quot;X&quot; is unramified over if and only if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;/&quot;S&quot; is unramified and if and only if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;/&quot;S&quot; is a monomorphism. &quot;X&quot; is étale over if and only if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;/&quot;S&quot; is étale and if and only if &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;/&quot;S&quot; is an isomorphism.

=== Arithmetic Frobenius ===
The arithmetic Frobenius morphism of an -scheme is a morphism:
:formula_44
defined by:
:formula_45
That is, it is the base change of &quot;F&quot;&quot;S&quot; by 1&quot;X&quot;.

Again, if:
:formula_46
:formula_47
then the arithmetic Frobenius is the homomorphism:
:formula_48
If we rewrite as:
:formula_49
then this homomorphism is:
:formula_50

=== Geometric Frobenius ===
Assume that the absolute Frobenius morphism of is invertible with inverse formula_51. Let formula_52 denote the -scheme formula_53. Then there is an extension of scalars of by formula_51:
:formula_55
If:
:formula_46
then extending scalars by formula_51 gives:
:formula_58
If:
:formula_35
then we write:
:formula_60
and then there is an isomorphism:
:formula_61

The geometric Frobenius morphism of an -scheme is a morphism:
:formula_62
defined by:
:formula_63
It is the base change of formula_51 by .

Continuing our example of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; above, geometric Frobenius is defined to be:
:formula_65
After rewriting &quot;R&quot; in terms of formula_66, geometric Frobenius is:
:formula_67

=== Arithmetic and geometric Frobenius as Galois actions ===
Suppose that the Frobenius morphism of is an isomorphism. Then it generates a subgroup of the automorphism group of . If is the spectrum of a finite field, then its automorphism group is the Galois group of the field over the prime field, and the Frobenius morphism and its inverse are both generators of the automorphism group. In addition, and may be identified with . The arithmetic and geometric Frobenius morphisms are then endomorphisms of , and so they lead to an action of the Galois group of &quot;k&quot; on &quot;X&quot;.

Consider the set of &quot;K&quot;-points . This set comes with a Galois action: Each such point &quot;x&quot; corresponds to a homomorphism from the structure sheaf to &quot;K&quot;, which factors via &quot;k(x)&quot;, the residue field at &quot;x&quot;, and the action of Frobenius on &quot;x&quot; is the application of the Frobenius morphism to the residue field. This Galois action agrees with the action of arithmetic Frobenius: The composite morphism
:formula_68
is the same as the composite morphism:
:formula_69
by the definition of the arithmetic Frobenius. Consequently, arithmetic Frobenius explicitly exhibits the action of the Galois group on points as an endomorphism of &quot;X&quot;.

== Frobenius for local fields ==
Given an unramified finite extension of local fields, there is a concept of Frobenius endomorphism that induces the Frobenius endomorphism in the corresponding extension of residue fields.

Suppose is an unramified extension of local fields, with ring of integers &quot;OK&quot; of such that the residue field, the integers of modulo their unique maximal ideal , is a finite field of order , where is a power of a prime. If is a prime of lying over , that is unramified means by definition that the integers of modulo , the residue field of , will be a finite field of order extending the residue field of where is the degree of . We may define the Frobenius map for elements of the ring of integers of as an automorphism of such that

:formula_70

==Frobenius for global fields==
In algebraic number theory, Frobenius elements are defined for extensions of global fields that are finite Galois extensions for prime ideals of that are unramified in . Since the extension is unramified the decomposition group of is the Galois group of the extension of residue fields. The Frobenius element then can be defined for elements of the ring of integers of as in the local case, by

:formula_71

where is the order of the residue field .

Lifts of the Frobenius are in correspondence with p-derivations.

==Examples==
The polynomial

has discriminant

and so is unramified at the prime 3; it is also irreducible mod 3. Hence adjoining a root of it to the field of -adic numbers gives an unramified extension of . We may find the image of under the Frobenius map by locating the root nearest to , which we may do by Newton&#x27;s method. We obtain an element of the ring of integers in this way; this is a polynomial of degree four in with coefficients in the -adic integers . Modulo this polynomial is

:formula_72.

This is algebraic over and is the correct global Frobenius image in terms of the embedding of into ; moreover, the coefficients are algebraic and the result can be expressed algebraically. However, they are of degree 120, the order of the Galois group, illustrating the fact that explicit computations are much more easily accomplished if -adic results will suffice.

If is an abelian extension of global fields, we get a much stronger congruence since it depends only on the prime in the base field . For an example, consider the extension of obtained by adjoining a root satisfying

:formula_73

to . This extension is cyclic of order five, with roots

:formula_74

for integer . It has roots that are Chebyshev polynomials of :

give the result of the Frobenius map for the primes 2, 3 and 5, and so on for larger primes not equal to 11 or of the form (which split). It is immediately apparent how the Frobenius map gives a result equal mod to the -th power of the root .

<text>Bone Against Steel is the ninth studio album by the southern rock band 38 Special, released in 1991. It was their last album until their 1997 comeback and the last album to feature the vocalist and keyboard player Max Carl. It would also be their last album with long time guitarist and founding member Jeff Carlisi and drummer Jack Grondin.

The album itself was a modest commercial success and only reached #170 on the Billboard 200 album chart. However, the single &quot;The Sound of Your Voice&quot; (also known as &quot;Sound of Your Voice&quot;), was a major hit, and one of three songs co-written by Survivor&#x27;s Jim Peterik for the album. The song reached #2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100 (their last Top 40 hit and last appearance on that chart to date), while the second of the three Peterik songs, &quot;Rebel to Rebel&quot;, only reached #30 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.

<text>The 31st Canadian Parliament was a briefly lived parliament in session from October 9 until December 14, 1979. The membership was set by the 1979 federal election on May 22, 1979, and it was dissolved after the minority government of Joe Clark failed to pass a Motion of Confidence on December 13, 1979. The dissolution of parliament led to the 1980 federal election. Lasting only 66 days from first sitting to dissolution, and only nine months from election to election, the 31st was the shortest parliament in Canadian history.

The 31st Parliament was controlled by a Progressive Conservative Party minority led by Prime Minister Joe Clark and the 21st Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Liberal Party, led by former prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

The Speaker was James Jerome. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1976-1987 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

There was only one session of the 31st Parliament:
