<text>GRP® Records (Grusin-Rosen Productions) is a jazz record label founded by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen in 1978. Distributed by Verve Records, GRP® was originally known for its digital recordings that focuses on its jazz genre.

==History==
With Grusin and Rosen flourishing in their respective careers as a film composer, jazz musician, engineer and commercial music producer, a chance recording session for a commercial would set up what would become the seeds of their eventual partnership. Rosen had just recorded a musician named Jon Lucien in 1972 in which Lucien would sing and play for the engineer and fledging producer. Rosen was excited about the prospects of recording him and then contacted Grusin to do the musical arrangements for the potential album. The album &quot;Rashida&quot; for RCA Victor released in 1973 was Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s first producing job and they followed up their first collaboration with Lucien with &quot;Song For My Lady&quot; for Columbia Records in 1975. Grusin during this time would not only provide arrangements for the likes of Sergio Mendes and Peggy Lee but also began a prolific partnership in Hollywood with the late director Sydney Pollack, that would benefit both men as they worked together for more than three decades until Pollack&#x27;s passing in the late 2000s. Their first film together &quot;The Yakuza&quot; for Warner Bros. would also feature one of Grusin&#x27;s best friends and also a label mate in popular guitarist Lee Ritenour, who was around 19 years old at the time, and &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; starring Oscar Award winner Robert Redford, which is the most popular score and film of their decades-long collaboration.

===1975–1977===
In 1975 when Rosen was visiting Los Angeles CA where Grusin was working at the time, he made a proposition to Grusin to form a company together since they had already been collaborating on several projects. Grusin agreed and as soon as that happened, Dr. George Butler, who was running Blue Note Records called them to produce an album by a young musician from Detroit MI who been playing with jazz and R&amp;B star George Benson with CTI Records named Earl Klugh. They both agreed and Klugh&#x27;s self-titled album released in 1976 would be the first official release under their newly formed production company, Grusin/Rosen Productions. They would produce two more Klugh albums for Blue Note, &quot;Living Inside Your Love&quot; and &quot;Finger Paintings&quot;.

Also during this period, the pair would go on to produce another of Rosen&#x27;s recording musicians for his commercials in violinist Noel Pointer, his debut album for Blue Note &quot;Phantazia&quot; and his follow-up album, &quot;Hold On&quot;. &quot;Phantazia&quot; featured the debut of flautist Dave Valentin, who would be the first artist signed to the soon-to-be-born label in 1978.

They also produced albums for other artists, including Patti Austin&#x27;s &quot;Havana Candy&quot; for CTI Records, Lee Ritenour&#x27;s &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Journey&quot; for Elektra Records, and Yutaka Yokokura&#x27;s &quot;Love Light&quot; for Alfa Records Japan, which was a hit throughout the US despite being released only in Japan, where the album was considered a commercial failure, as well as Grusin&#x27;s &quot;One of a Kind&quot; for Polydor Records.

They were all successfully-produced albums, especially during the latter half of the decade, when disco had become a successful musical fad. They were also able to accomplish this with somewhat limited airplay before more radio stations that featured solely jazz would hit the airwaves, which eventually happened in later years throughout the US. Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s albums were so well produced that radio stations did find a place for them, which would benefit them in the next couple of decades.

===1978–1981===

Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s success as producers led to a meeting with Arista Records chief Clive Davis, whose Novus Records jazz banner had produced solid albums that were not selling despite positive reviews. Davis offered Grusin and Rosen a deal that would make them producers for at least three jazz artists per year, which the pair was not interested in doing. Grusin and Rosen wanted a logo deal that would make them established, and Davis agreed to it.

GRP/Arista Records was formed and the very first artist signed under their new deal was flautist Dave Valentin, who had made his debut on his friend Noel Pointer&#x27;s albums for Blue Note. Singer Angela Bofill, who was Valentin&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, was also signed to the label along with trumpet player Tom Browne, vibraphonist Jay Hoggard and the youngest performer under their banner, high school piano prodigy Bernard Wright, who was 16 years old when he recorded his debut album &quot;&#x27;Nard&quot; in 1980, among the other artists they signed and produced.

Valentin&#x27;s debut album &quot;Legends&quot; would sell more than 70,000 copies, Bofill&#x27;s debut album &quot;Angie&quot; would sell over 280,000 copies and Browne&#x27;s debut album &quot;Browne Sugar&quot; would sell more than 700,000 copies, which surprised many and solidified Grusin&#x27;s and Rosen&#x27;s reputations as producers.

Also during this period, Grusin made his first pure digital recording, the best-selling album &quot;Mountain Dance&quot;, which was recorded live with no overdubbing and utilized some of the best recording technology at the time including the digital Soundstream Editing System, which was from Salt Lake City UT. The album was recorded in five grueling days and was one of the first digital recordings produced in 1979.

Grusin then took a group of artists for a tour in Japan which was documented by the album &quot;Dave Grusin and the GRP All-Stars In Japan&quot; and featured many of the label&#x27;s artists including Grusin and his brother Don Grusin, Tom Browne, Dave Valentin, Bobby Broom, Marcus Miller, Buddy Williams, and guest Japanese saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, which was recorded in fall of 1980 and would be the first of many GRP concerts that they would hold over the years there.

===1982===

Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s time at Arista Records was coming to an end as Clive Davis and the label were seeing different visions for the success of the label. Davis wanted to concentrate on hit singles by the latest hot artists for extended airplay, while Grusin and Rosen were concentrated on great sound quality, performances and establishing a bigger audience for jazz at that point in time. They also felt that the albums they produced were not given the highest priority and given the back of the bus treatment with no advertising or advertising to the wrong demographic of music fans or the albums were not available on their release date. Grusin and Rosen made an amenable parting with Arista and Davis in which they were able to acquire a few albums that they produced including bestsellers such as &quot;Legends&quot;, &quot;Browne Sugar&quot;, &quot;The Hawk&quot; (Dave Valentin&#x27;s follow-up album to &quot;Legends&quot;), &quot;Without Rhyme Or Reason&quot; by Scott Jarrett (brother of jazz pianist Keith Jarrett), &quot;Days Like These&quot; by Hoggard and Grusin&#x27;s own albums &quot;Mountain Dance&quot; and &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;. They were also able to acquire other albums they were involved with from other labels that included Grusin&#x27;s &quot;One of a Kind&quot; from Polydor Records and Lee Ritenour&#x27;s &quot;On The Line&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; from Elektra Records, which was recorded in 1978 as a hybrid digital and analog recording that was recorded both in the US and in Brazil, while the former was a pure digital recording with no overdubbing whatsoever.

Other albums that they produced under their banner would stay with Arista, which is now owned by Sony Music Entertainment. This would also be true of artists such as Tom Browne and Angela Bofill, who was coaxed into leaving GRP by Davis for a more lucrative deal with the label that resulted in watered-down drum machine material much like Browne&#x27;s. In later years, after her short-lived success under Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s tutelage, Bofill would suffer some personal health-related setbacks after recording with various different labels throughout the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. Browne&#x27;s career would not take off after such a promising start and ended up much like Bofill&#x27;s throughout the rest of the 80&#x27;s and Browne tried to return to his roots throughout the 1990s without much success.

Soon they would make a very important decision that would change the history of jazz, since both Grusin and Rosen both strongly felt that all of the albums they had produced for most labels were getting the &quot;back of the bus&quot; treatment without proper advertising or promotion. They were also disappointed that the albums they produced were not released or available at record stores on their release dates. Taking in all of these factors, Grusin and Rosen formed a record company because they wanted to be in control of all of these factors. This led to them signing established jazz stars such as Lee Ritenour, Billy Cobham, Chick Corea, Dizzy Gillespie, and Gerry Mulligan, to go along with Dave Valentin, who joined Grusin and Rosen after leaving Arista Records along with newbies, guitarist Kevin Eubanks, the group Special EFX and Diane Schuur, a blind singer-pianist from Seattle WA, who was discovered by the late saxophonist Stan Getz and invited to the White House in 1982 to perform with Getz for First Lady Nancy Reagan on a special that aired on PBS.

The Compact Disc Player and Compact Disc were introduced that year in Japan; Grusin and Rosen were intrigued by its audiophile sound and it was something they felt would be vital to the growth of the company.

===1982–1989===

Now established as a record company, Grusin and Rosen were pushing forward and thinking of the future and how to make the label stand out with the evolving technology of the times. Grusin and Rosen figured that the compact disc with its optical and audiophile capabilities would be a very important part of what they were trying to do to make the label successful, which was to produce high-quality recordings with the best sound and production available to them including recording venues, musicians and orchestras.

To accomplish this, they decided on a specific album that not only would introduce the best of what they were producing, but also an album that catered to those people who could afford the first CD players available for their homes, which cost $1,000 per unit at the time in 1982 and wouldn&#x27;t be completely available onto the market until Christmas 1983. After much research, the Glenn Miller Band was chosen to be the first album recorded for their company in January 1983. Members of the original band, as well as special guests like singer Mel Tormé, also participated in the ambitious project recorded in New York NY. The album &quot;In the Digital Mood&quot; not only became a popular album after its release selling more than 100,000 units, but also one of the label&#x27;s greatest selling albums to this day, and was recognized as such in 1992 with a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; to not only commemorate the label&#x27;s 10th Anniversary celebration but the Gold record status the album achieved.

They followed up this best selling album with Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;Little Big Horn&quot; and Grusin&#x27;s &quot;Dave Grusin and the NY-LA Dream Band&quot;, which was a live concert from 1982 that was recorded in Japan and seen throughout the country. The label during this period would be known mainly for its fusion work, but two of the first three releases were the straight-ahead jazz albums by Glenn Miller Band and Mulligan. Another vital addition was recording the great Dizzy Gillespie, which helped the label even more as Grusin and Rosen teamed him up with the best of the young jazz musicians performing at the time, including saxophonist Branford Marsalis and pianist Kenny Kirkland for the album &quot;New Faces&quot;.

Compact discs were carried in limited supply in record stores but were available wherever CD player systems were sold at that time when they were first released. Knowing this, Grusin and Rosen produced CD Samplers (three in three different volumes from 1984 to 1987) that showcased the artists on the label, the sound quality, and performances due to the lack of other record labels having joined the format at that time which lasted until 1987, when a lot of the record labels made the transition to the CD format. These CDs did help gain the label an audience with the audiophiles who first bought these machines and also, to expand the label in format. Their first batches of pressed discs from 1984 until 1987 came directly from Japan by the JVC Corporation, which are audiophile in quality and were quality produced recordings that truly displayed the dynamic range of the performances, unlike an LP or cassette.

In 1984, Grusin would release his second purely digitally recorded album and his first one for his label, &quot;Night-Lines&quot;, which used even more contemporary digital equipment and instruments not unlike his 1979 effort for Arista Records, &quot;Mountain Dance&quot;. So would artist Billy Cobham and his purely digital album, &quot;Warning&quot;, who recorded this album during the year. which contained a disclaimer of &quot;not playing your stereo at high volume due to the nature of the recording that could cause damage to your equipment&quot;.

Grusin and Rosen were approached by the JVC Corporation late in 1984 to represent them because of their standards for the highest quality in recording and for their well-regarded albums for the latest in their audio technology. So for the first time under their own banner, the label conducted its first live tour around Europe and the US during the Summer of 1985. Eventually, the label decided to have a &quot;live session&quot; which was videotaped at the Record Plant Recording Studio in Los Angeles CA as well, featuring all of the members that traveled including Grusin, Ritenour, Valentin, Schuur and their GRP recording members. A highlight album of the live recording at The Record Plant was released as &quot;Live In Session&quot; as well as a videocassette, a laserdisc and eventually DVD a long time later were released to commemorate the event. Later on, the label would go on to produce videocassettes and laserdiscs of their live concerts in their complete form that would include A GRP Christmas Collection and GRP Super Live in Concert which a showcase for the label&#x27;s recent additions like the Chick Corea Elektric Band, saxophonist Tom Scott as well as the label&#x27;s stars, Dave Grusin, Lee Ritenour and Diane Schuur. The label would also produce their first CD+G album sampler called GRP Digital Sampler on the Cutting Edge, which was designed for a karaoke styled CD player with the capability to be connected to a television and listen to the music on the CD as well as see a bio of the artist performing which was released in 1989.

Also in 1984 the film, &quot;Falling In Love&quot; starring Oscar winners Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep would be released by Paramount Pictures. Grusin provided the original musical score for the film, but the film had been tracked by music from Grusin&#x27;s breakthrough digital album, &quot;Mountain Dance,&quot; which became the main theme for the film despite writing a purely jazz score in the same vein.

In 1985, the label released their first-ever soundtrack to any motion picture for the drama, &quot;American Flyers&quot; starring Oscar winner Kevin Costner, which was composed and performed by Lee Ritenour and Greg Mathieson, who were with the label exclusively at the time. The album was never released on CD until Varèse Sarabande finally released it in 2016.

Lee Ritenour would make his &quot;official&quot; debut for the label after his contract with Elektra Records had ended and his debut album was his pairing with founder Dave Grusin on the album, &quot;Harlequin&quot;, which melded Brazilian and American styles of jazz together on one of the most popular albums for the label.

In 1986, Eddie Daniels would make his Grammy-nominated debut for the label with &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, which was a fusion album of a different sort as Daniels&#x27; clarinet solos were mixed with a huge London Orchestra creating a very elaborate and popular album that melded both jazz and classical together. A year later, Daniels&#x27; follow-up album for the label &quot;To Bird With Love&quot;, would be the very first &quot;pure&quot; jazz recording for the label dedicated to the late saxophonist Charlie Parker, gaining positive reviews.

The late pianist Chick Corea would also make his official debut for the label introducing a new band called Chick Corea Elektric Band, which is also the name of the album they recorded for the label and would later introduce Chick Corea Akoustic Band in 1989 with fellow members John Patitucci and Dave Weckl, who also recorded for the label along with Eric Marienthal, who was a member of Chick Corea Elektric Band between 1988 and 1994.

By 1987, the label was no longer independent as they signed a distribution deal with MCA Distributing, one of the six largest distribution companies in the US at the time. The deal was significant at the time because it helped the label reach the top of the Billboard Magazine charts as the number one jazz label in the world starting in 1988, according to the Billboard polls, as more people would have access to their recordings unlike before.

They also produced and released a similar project to that of the Glenn Miller Band dedicated to one of jazz&#x27;s greatest legends, Duke Ellington. The album &quot;Digital Duke&quot; reassembled members of Duke Ellington&#x27;s band under the direction of his son, Mercer, in a digital recording setting with the latest technology. The album was produced in conjunction to the USPS&#x27;s official $0.22 stamp dedicated to Ellington a year earlier commemorating his 87th birthday.

The label also signed vibraphonist Gary Burton and saxophonist Tom Scott, who would make significant contributions to the label with well-received albums of their own in &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Born Again&quot;, which is Scott&#x27;s first pure jazz recording for the label and the first in more than a decade at the time and &quot;Them Changes&quot;, which featured music from the short-lived talk show &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot; that ran on CBS from January 1989 to 1990, where Scott was the musical director on.

1988 marked a couple of firsts for the label. Flautist Dave Valentin recorded his first &quot;Live&quot; album for the label and that for any solo artist on the label, &quot;Live at the Blue Note&quot;, which was a two-night recording that took place on May 31 and June 1 of that year, which would mark the first of a series of &quot;Live Albums&quot; for the artists on the label which would follow in later years with Chick Corea (&quot;Alive&quot;), The Rippingtons (&quot;Live in L.A.&quot;), and &quot;Dave Grusin Presents GRP All-Star Big Band Live!&quot;, which was the follow-up album to the original GRP All-Star Big Band from the label&#x27;s 10th anniversary.

The label also recorded the first of three Christmas albums featuring artists from the label entitled &quot;A GRP Christmas Collection&quot; that included jazz interpretations of classic Christmas songs and some that are obscure arranged in diverse ways by the artist recording on it. The label would produce two more albums in 1991 and 1993, which was the final one under Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s supervision before they departed from the label in 1994. The artists that participated in the album included the likes of Grusin, Lee Ritenour, David Benoit, Gary Burton, Tom Scott, Diane Schuur, Nelson Rangell, Arturo Sandoval, Chick Corea, Eddie Daniels, New York Voices, George Howard, Ramsey Lewis, B.B. King, Russ Freeman and Yellowjackets among others.

Grusin would win his first Academy Award for Robert Redford&#x27;s 2nd film as a director, &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;, which would be released a year later as part of his last album for the label of the decade, &quot;Migration&quot;.

The label also signed popular harpist, Deborah Henson-Conant to further diversify the label much like they had done in the late 1970s which got their label off and running. Signing her to a 4-album deal in which her 4th album for the label in 1993 called &quot;Budapest&quot;, was abruptly cancelled and released by another label.

By the end of 1989, GRP is named the number one jazz label in the world by voters. Radio stations like New York NY&#x27;s CD 101.9 on the East Coast and WNUA 95.5 in Chicago IL were up and running under the &quot;smooth jazz&quot; format where a lot of the label&#x27;s stars began to shine and the label would create samplers on behalf of the record stations to promote the label and the artist. This gave them considerably strong airplay over the radio. The label would have a successful year with albums by David Benoit, Lee Ritenour, Dave Grusin, Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Diane Schuur and Nelson Rangell that would propel them into the 1990s on a high note.

Grusin would celebrate his 1988 Academy Award win with another nomination for his score and important participation for the comedy-drama, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, starring Oscar Winner Jeff Bridges, Academy Award Nominee Beau Bridges (Jeff&#x27;s brother) and Academy Award Nominee Michelle Pfeiffer. The film would receive multiple nominations, including Best Picture and for Grusin&#x27;s invaluable contribution for Best Original Score. The album would be a best seller for the label.

===1990–1994===

In early 1990, Grusin and Rosen decided to sell the label to the MCA Corporation for the sum of $40 million in celebration of their 3-year deal with MCA Distributing. However, this was a differently structured deal in which the company would not be absorbed or merged with another within the family of labels under the MCA Records label. This particular deal was one in which the company expanded to something much bigger. GRP now had the sole exclusivity to produce and release new as well as old recordings by artists were currently on the MCA Records roster that included Larry Carlton, B.B. King, Spyro Gyra, Yellowjackets, George Howard, Acoustic Alchemy, Michael Brecker, and The Crusaders, among others.

In addition to that, GRP was also solely responsible for reissuing, remastering and releasing premiere titles from the Impulse!, Chess, Argo and Decca catalogs that featured a wealth of jazz recordings from popular jazz artists that include John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Ramsey Lewis, Keith Jarrett, Coleman Hawkins, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, McCoy Tyner and many, many more. Recordings that have taken at least three decades to release at the present time and continue to be reissued currently. One of their first reissues, &quot;Billie Holiday: The Complete Decca Recordings&quot; won Grammy Awards in 1991.

Also in 1990, Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval defected to the US and the label immediately signed him and made his debut for the label in 1991 with the album &quot;Flight To Freedom&quot;, his first five solo albums and several other appearances on the label with fellow recording artists such as Dave Valentin, Rene Luis Toledo, Dave Grusin and a well-received album dedicated to his best friend, the late Dizzy Gillespie, &quot;Dream Come True&quot;, which featured a collaboration with Oscar Winner Michel Legrand and albums such as &quot;A GRP Christmas Collection&quot;, and the &quot;GRP All-Star Big Band,&quot; to name a few until his final album, the critically acclaimed &quot;Swingin&quot;&#x27; for the label in 1996.

Grusin would also receive a third consecutive Academy Award Nomination for the Robert Redford drama, &quot;Havana&quot;, directed by his best friend, Sydney Pollack, in which the label released the soundtrack for the film.

In 1992, the label celebrated its 10th anniversary after being formed in 1982 in spectacular fashion as Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen assembled nearly every artist with the exception of singers Diane Schuur and Patti Austin to record the album &quot;GRP All-Star Big Band&quot;, which was recorded in January 1992 and featured prominent jazz artists such as Lee Ritenour, Arturo Sandoval, Eddie Daniels, Tom Scott, Gary Burton, Dave Weckl, Nelson Rangell, among others. The label not only released a CD with bonus tracks, but also they recorded the event which was available on both VHS and LaserDisc. The album and the band proved to be so popular that fans asked for more of the band and seeing them live in concert. They listened to the fans and did a follow-up album called &quot;Dave Grusin Presents GRP All-Star Big Band Live!&quot;, which was released in 1993 based on the tour of the band that featured most of the artist on the original recording in 1992 and some of band members who participated in that recording. They would do one final recording in 1995, &quot;All Blues&quot;, shortly before Grusin and Rosen would leave the label.

It was also fitting that the label would also pay homage to their very first release, &quot;Glenn Miller Orchestra: In the Digital Mood&quot;, which started the label and album had become a Gold Record after selling more than a million copies since its release in 1983. The label produced an elaborate &quot;Gold Edition&quot; featuring a bonus track not on the original release and new special artwork to commemorate the event.

The Rippingtons would record their album &quot;Live in L.A.&quot; that would feature the popular jazz group in a live setting from their September 1992 concert which was also sold as a video cassette and LaserDisc to coincide with the release of the CD in June 1993.

In 1993, the label released Dave Grusin&#x27;s score to the Tom Cruise thriller &quot;The Firm&quot;, which was based on the John Grisham novel which was a blockbuster hit and the album was a best seller for the label. What made this particular soundtrack unique was that it was an all piano score by Grusin and much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score by the Academy Awards branch which added another accolade for the company. &quot;The Cure&quot; would be his final soundtrack released for the label which came out after his departure in 1995.

Also that year, Sergio Salvatore, a young pianist from NJ would make his debut on the label. What made this release unique was the fact that Salvatore was only 13 years old at the time the album was recorded and became the youngest artist ever signed to the label. Bernard Wright, who Grusin and Rosen produced in the early 1980s during their logo deal with Arista Records, was their youngest at 16 years old until Salvatore was signed. Grusin and Rosen had seen the child prodigy on the Johnny Carson Show and were highly impressed by his maturity and performance. The label would produce and release his self-titled release &quot;Sergio Salvatore&quot; during 1993 and his well-received follow up, &quot;Tune Up&quot; in 1994, which featured many of GRP&#x27;s artists including Chick Corea, Gary Burton and Russ Freeman until Salvatore left the label after Grusin and Rosen departed and recorded with both Concord Records in 1996 and N2K Encoded Music in 1997, where Grusin and Rosen were both involved with that label in some capacity.

In 1994, the label would release the soundtrack to the hit and critically acclaimed documentary film &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;, which was nominated for Academy Awards and had fallen into a lot controversy about how the film was handled by the Academy voters branch.

The label would also pay homage to a few jazz legends in albums recorded by both Dave Grusin and Arturo Sandoval. The albums &quot;The Gershwin Connection&quot; and &quot;Homage to Duke&quot; by Grusin, and &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot; by Sandoval, were purely jazz albums dedicated to George Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Clifford Brown, where were best-sellers for the label and featured elaborate artwork.

Also, by this time the label had produced several offshoots that included Stretch Records, Peak Records, and a partnership with MCA in which a few releases by artists such as Laima and Patti Austin were under the GRP/MCA partnership. This did not last long, however.

===1995 - 2015===

After founders Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen left the label in early in 1995, famed producer Tommy LiPuma was given the reins of the label with a few of Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s artists staying on board, including David Benoit (who would finally leave in the mid 2000&#x27;s), Arturo Sandoval (who would depart after 1996), Lee Ritenour (who would depart in 1996 and return in 2002), The Rippingtons featuring Russ Freeman (who would depart the label in 1996), Gary Burton (who would depart in 1996), Spyro Gyra (who would depart in the late 1990s), Diane Schuur (who would leave after 1997), Tom Scott (who would depart late in the 1990s), Nelson Rangell (who would depart in 1997), Joe Sample (who stayed with the label until his passing), Larry Carlton (who would go onto record with his regular group, Fourplay, and would sign with Warner Bros. Records after 1996), Acoustic Alchemy and Ramsey Lewis (who would leave after 1997). Many original or recently signed artists also departed, including Dave Valentin (who had recorded 15 albums for the label after being the very first artist signed to the label in 1978 until 1994), Chick Corea (who left for Concord Music during 1995 after his final release for GRP), Sergio Salvatore (who signed with Concord Records in 1996 and N-Coded Music Music in 1997), The Yellowjackets (who would be signed by Warner Bros. Records), B.B. King, Michael Brecker (whose contract was transferred back to Impulse! Records where he had originally signed during the 1980s), Philip Bent, Laima, Billy Taylor (who left after two albums), Special EFX, Carl Anderson, Sczachi, Teodross Avery (who Grusin and Rosen signed in 1993 had his contract transferred to Impulse!), Eddie Daniels (had already left in 1994 to sign for Shanachie Records), Patti Austin, Urban Knights (who would leave for Narada Jazz after 1997) and John Patitucci (who would leave for Concord Music in 1996) among the many artists who were not brought back when their contracts expired.

After this turnover, LiPuma brought in some familiar faces and new artists that he felt would keep Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s vision of the label alive while integrating his own musical ideals. These artists included Grammy Award winners George Benson, Al Jarreau, David Sanborn, hot newcomer Mindi Abair, Keiko Matsui, Marc Antoine, Rick Braun, Chris Botti, Rachel Z, Will Downing, and former New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams&#x27; who made his debut album as a professional jazz guitarist in 2003 and would be his only album recorded for the label. This established group of popular jazz artists were the perfect complements to those artists who survived the purge of the label for the years following.

However, the biggest coup for GRP was signing Grammy Award-winning pianist and singer Diana Krall from Impulse!, which gave the label class and stability over the next decade or so. Her popularity had kept the label afloat for a long time (until she eventually signed with Verve in the mid-2000s), along with saxophonist Mindi Abair, who made her debut in 2003 and was an instant hit with smooth jazz fans until leaving the label after 2005, where she has become a major star for Concord Music.

Founder Dave Grusin returned for a brief stint recorded a tribute album dedicated to the music of the legendary Henry Mancini entitled &quot;Two for the Road&quot; in 1996 and released in 1997. This would be the 2nd to last album for the label, with &quot;Now Playing&quot;, a solo piano album dedicated to his music from the films he had composed the music for recorded in 2003 and eventually released in 2004 being his last official release on the label.

The label would change its name and moniker to &quot;Great Records Period&quot; after 1995 under LiPuma&#x27;s direction since Grusin and Rosen had sold the company in 1994.

In later years, the label would take a more commercial direction signing artists like Sarah McLachlan, Ledisi and others to the label which has gone away from its jazz roots. Sadly, it has not released anything in recent years and has pretty much been retired by the Universal Music Group which the label is under their banner.

Co-founder and partner, Larry Rosen passed away in 2015.

===1983-1996===

The compact disc was vital to the label&#x27;s existence and continued digital excellence throughout its history. After splitting from Arista Records to go on their own, Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen, the founders gambled on the format to bring out their spirited high quality recordings to life. From 1983 until 1987, all of their CD releases were pressed by JVC Japan which added impeccable sound and sonic clarity that made the CDs pretty much sell themselves even in audio stores that had to carry the discs to sell with the expensive CD players that were released during this time. The first official album produced and recorded for this purpose was &quot;In the Digital Mood&quot; featuring the music of the late big band jazz leader, Glenn Miller, which was a high end production recorded in January 1983 for two important reasons. The first was to produce an album that would suit the format&#x27;s sonic capabilities and the second was that the first people who would buy the first CD players would be audiophile fanatics that would be in the range of enjoying this type of music. Grusin and Rosen&#x27;s intuitions were proven right as the album went on to Gold Record status within 10 years of its release and had sold over a million copies. The label&#x27;s original releases were albums that Grusin and Rosen bought or licensed from Arista Records as well as other label&#x27;s such as Polydor, JVC Japan and Elektra from artists such as Dave Valentin (who was the label&#x27;s first signing), Lee Ritenour, Tom Browne, Jay Hoggard, Scott Jarrett and Grusin himself. There were plenty of new and fresh album releases by jazz legends Gerry Mulligan and jazz&#x27;s ambassador Dizzy Gillespie in new sonic, digital settings along with new talent being displayed by the likes of Diane Schuur, Kevin Eubanks, and Special EFX along with veteran drummer Billy Cobham, who would be joined later on by Ritenour, Chick Corea, Eddie Daniels, David Benoit, Gary Burton and Tom Scott to add more diversity to label&#x27;s roster. The label would sign a distribution deal with MCA in 1987 and it was the final year that the label would have their CD titles pressed by JVC Japan for the US. All titles would be pressed in the US starting in 1988.

<text>Ustadh Sis (also spelled: Ustad Sis, or Ostad Sis, ) was a Persian heresiarch and anti-Abbasid rebel leader. It is speculated that he was once a governor of Khorasan and possibly father to Al-Ma&#x27;mun’s Iranian mother, Marajil, which would make him Ma&#x27;mūn&#x27;s maternal grandfather.

Based in the eastern fringe of Khorasan, in the mid-8th-century he claimed he was a prophet of God and managed to gain followers among the villagers in that area. Many were previously followers of Bihafarid, whom the Abbasid commander, Abu Muslim, had crushed militarily.

== Reinvigoration of Bihafarid&#x27;s movement ==

Ustadh Sis launched a rebellion in 767, purportedly with 300,000 fighting men. His initial base was the mountainous region of Badghis, and he soon occupied Herat and Sistan before marching towards Merv. He initially defeated an Abbasid army under the command of al-Ajtham of Merv, but was then defeated in a bloody battle against an army led by Muhammad ibn Abdallah, the son of the Caliph al-Mansur (and a future Caliph).

According to al-Tabari, 70,000 of Ustadh Sis&#x27;s followers were killed in the battle and 14,000 were taken captive. Ustadh Sis managed to flee to the mountains, but Abbasid general Khazim ibn Khuzayma al-Tamimi followed him and was able to capture him. Ustadh Sis was sent in chains to al-Mansur, who ordered his execution. Later, al-Mahdi gave an amnesty to the 30,000 captives.

<doc id="1108791" wikidata="Q512996" url="?curid=1108791" title="Lützow Free Corps">
<text>Lützow Free Corps ( ) was a volunteer force of the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars. It was named after its commander, Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. The Corpsmen were also widely known as the “&quot;Lützower Jäger&quot;“ or “&quot;Schwarze Jäger&quot;“ (“Black Hunters”), sometimes also &quot;Lützower Reiter&quot; (&quot;Lützow Riders&quot;).

==Origins==
The unit was officially founded in February 1813 as &quot;Königlich Preußisches Freikorps von Lützow&quot; (Royal Prussian Free Corps von Lützow). Lützow, who had been an officer under the ill-fated Ferdinand von Schill, obtained permission from the Prussian Chief-of-Staff Gerhard von Scharnhorst to organize a free corps consisting of infantry, cavalry, and Tyrolean &quot;Jäger&quot; (literally, “hunters” ― &quot;i.e&quot;., marksmen, snipers), for flank attacks and guerrilla warfare behind the French lines. Volunteers were to be drawn from all over Germany (including Austria) to fight against Napoleon I of France; it was hoped that this broadly national force would aid in rallying the smaller German governments into the ranks of the Allies.

The Corps has been alleged to have consisted mostly of students and academics; however, in reality these amounted to no more than 12% of the total force, which was actually composed mostly of craftsmen and laborers. Besides the well-known Saxon dramatist and poet Carl Theodor Körner, the Corps also included academics, writers, and other well known figures, such as Georg Friedrich Kersting, Friedrich Friesen, Joseph von Eichendorff, and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. The educator Friedrich Fröbel, who later developed the concept of the Kindergarten, also belonged to the Lützowers. In addition, at least two women, Eleonore Prochaska and Anna Lühring, managed to join in disguise.

The Tyroleans, whose leaders Jakob Riedl and Joseph Ennemoser had fought with Andreas Hofer for the liberation of Tyrol since 1809, came into the Lützow Corps after the armistice of Summer 1813.

==Uniforms==

Because the Kingdom of Prussia already had problems financing and equipping its regular forces, the volunteers had to equip and supply themselves by their own means. Many times civilian clothing or old uniforms ― even enemy uniforms taken as booty ― were simply dyed. Black was therefore used for their uniforms rather than the normal Prussian blue, because this was the only color that could be used to dye the improvised clothing (if any other had been used, the clothing&#x27;s original color would have shown through, resulting in an unacceptable mix of colors for the Corps as a whole). The quality of the material often left much to be desired.

For similar reasons of economy, a civilian-style trench coat, the so-called &quot;litewka&quot; frock coat ― double-breasted, without a tail-slit ― was chosen for infantry and rifle detachments, and later extended to the artillery. The tunic was black, as were the trousers, with red trim chosen for the rank insignia along the collar, cuffs, epaulets, and front edge of the tunic; on officers’ uniforms, collars and cuffs were faced in velvet. On the tunic’s front, eight embossed brass buttons were arranged in two vertical rows.

Volunteers with particular skills were allowed to transfer to special units with their own uniforms. Hussars and lancers (uhlans) wore dolman jackets, often brought from their former units, dyed black (as were the hussars’ pelisses). Hussars and lancers wore only black and white, the red being omitted. Officers’ uniforms carried silver cords, rather than white, and were in addition trimmed with black fur. Lützow himself wore the black hussar uniform.
The Tyrolean &quot;Jäger&quot; retained their previous uniform, gray with green facings.

Headgear

Due to its improvised nature, headgear worn by the Free Corps was varied. The infantry headgear corresponded to that of Schill’s corps of 1809, consisting of a black shako, with a clasp and side cordon and tassel. The cavalry wore a felt shako (though due to scarce resources, some were made even of cardboard) with a black-and-yellow braid and tassel; often a black oilcloth was worn over them as protection from the weather. For parades cavalry were accustomed to wear a black horsehair tassel and a black cordon. The Tyroleans continued to wear the turned up and plumed hats of their native region.

In addition, some volunteers sported peaked caps or even large berets. Often against orders the symbol of a civilian or student society would be attached. In the early days of the Corps, Lützow and others also wore a skull on their headgear (in the same manner as the Duke of Brunswick’s &quot;Schwarze Schar&quot;), until forbidden by royal command.

==Combat==
The Lützow Free Corps distinguished itself from the mass of the army, in that it was a voluntary association, whose members were remarkable for superior activity, energy, and enterprise. Unlike many of the regular army, their loyalty was rather to Germany as a whole than to Prussia or the House of Hohenzollern; many of them made a vow to neither cut their hair nor their beards till they had driven the French entirely out of German lands. Nevertheless, it had the highest percentage of deserters in the Army of Prussia, was treated with marked coolness by the King (who was anything but an ardent nationalist and anyway preferred his regulars), and accomplished relatively little in the way of major military success.

The average size of the Corps was 2,900 infantry, 600 cavalry and 120 artillery, varying throughout the war. It fought in many battles, operating first independently in the rear of the French troops, later as a regular unit in the allied armies. The Lützowers displayed great gallantry throughout the remainder of the war, and proved a source of constant annoyance to the French, who regarded them with exceptional hostility, Napoleon himself referring to their chief as &quot;ce brigand Lützow, chef du corps de la Vengeance&quot;&quot; (&quot;that bandit Lützow, head of the band of Revenge&quot;).

At the proclamation of the armistice of 4 June – 13 August 1813, the Corps, eager to gain a dashing victory against the hated emperor, had been deep behind enemy lines and were hastening back to German-held territory (supposedly under a French safe-conduct), when they were caught there in contradiction to the terms of armistice. The French general Fournier ordered an attack on the Corps, replying to a demand for explanation, &quot;Armistice pour tout le monde, excepté pour vous!&quot; (&quot;truce for everyone, except for you&quot;).

After the peace of 1814 the Corps was dissolved. The infantry were converted into the 25th Infantry Regiment (from 5 November 1816 known as the 1st Rhine) as regular infantrymen, consisting of 2419 men (82 officers / 2337 troops) organized into a 1st Battalion, 2nd Battalion, and 3rd Battalion, under the command of Christian Friedrich Engel von Petersdorff (who had been a major under Lützow); the cavalry were reorganized into the 6th Ulans under Lützow himself. After Napoleon’s return from Elba, both regiments fought at Ligny and Waterloo during the Hundred Days. The composition of their units remained unique and still bore the impress of the Lützow corps, &quot;e.g.&quot;, retaining the same black &quot;litewka&quot; and shako.

==Theodor Körner==
Upon hearing that the then Major von Lützow had announced the formation of the Free Corps, on 15 March 1813 Theodor Körner abandoned a promising career as a dramatist in Vienna and his engagement with the beautiful actress Antonie Adamberger. Inspired with the Romantic nationalism of the times, Körner felt himself irresistibly attracted towards a body consisting of volunteers drawn from all over the numerous German realms. On his arrival at Breslau with recommendations to the most influential men in the Prussian army, he joined the Corps on 19 March. As a member of the Corps he contributed songs and poems to celebrate and encourage his fellows, often accompanying himself on the guitar; many of these poems were later published by his father in the collection &quot;Leyer und Schwerdt&quot; (modern &quot;Leier und Schwert, &quot; “Lyre and Sword”) (Berlin, 1814). On 26 August an engagement took place at the forest of Rosenow near Gadebusch, in which Körner fell. Theodor Körner died at the age of twenty-one, and was buried under an oak in the village of Wöbbelin, about a mile from Ludwigslust.

==Legacy==
Despite its relatively small size and its lack of military success, the Corps became famous after the war, as it was the only unit in the army consisting of people from all over the German states.

Throughout the 19th century, these anti-Napoleonic Free Corps were greatly praised and glorified by German nationalists, and a heroic myth built up around their exploits. Inasmuch as many Lützow Free Corps veterans took part in the first Wartburg festival of 1817, demanding German unity and democratic reforms, the black-red-gold color scheme formed by the combination of black cloth, red trim, and brass buttons on their uniforms would later become associated with republican and nationalist (or Pan-German) ideals. During the Hambacher Fest of 1832 and Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, flags with these colors were used, if even often displayed in reverse order compared to modern day&#x27;s flag of Germany. This combination, reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (whose heraldic coat-of-arms depicted a black eagle on a shield of gold, often in later times with red beak and legs), was selected as the official national colors of the German flag in 1919, and again in 1949.

In the aftermath of Germany’s defeat in the First World War, the legend was invoked by extremist groups with far greater emphasis on its nationalism than on republicanism. Consequently, one of the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; active in the period of the Weimar Republic took the name “&quot;Freikorps Lützow&quot;.”

==Film==

The story of the Lützow Free Corps served as the basis for several historical films:
* &quot;Was Steine erzählen&quot; (“&quot;What the Stones Tell&quot;”) (Germany 1925, directed by Rudolf Randolf)
* &quot;Lützows wilde verwegene Jagd&quot; (“&quot;Lützow&#x27;s Wild Hunt&quot;”) (Germany 1927, directed by Richard Oswald)
* &quot;Theodor Körner&quot; (Germany 1932, directed by Carl Boese)
* &quot;Lützower&quot; (German Democratic Republic 1972, directed by Werner W. Wallroth)

<text>Juan-les-Pins (; ) is a town in the commune of Antibes in the Alpes-Maritimes department in Southeastern France. Located on the French Riviera, it is situated between Nice and Cannes, to the southwest of Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport. Juan-les-Pins is a major holiday destination popular with the international jet set, with a casino, nightclubs and beaches. It is served by Juan-les-Pins station on the Marseille–Ventimiglia railway.

==History==

Situated west of the town of Antibes on the western slope of the ridge, halfway to the old fishery village of Golfe-Juan (where Napoleon landed in 1815), it had been an area with many stone pine trees ( in French), where the inhabitants of Antibes used to go for a promenade, for a picnic in the shadow of the stone pine trees or to collect tree branches and cones for their stoves.

The village was given the name Juan-les-Pins on 12 March 1882. The spelling &quot;Juan&quot;, used instead of the customary French spelling, &quot;Jean&quot;, derives from the local Occitan dialect. Other names discussed for the town include &quot;Héliopolis&quot;, &quot;Antibes-les-Pins&quot; and &quot;Albany-les-Pins&quot; (after the Duke of Albany, the fourth son of Queen Victoria).

The following year, 1883, it was decided to build a railway station in Juan-les-Pins on the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée (PLM) line that had been there since 1863.

In 1926, the famous hotel Le Provençal was opened and received guests like Charlie Chaplin, Lilian Harvey, Jack L. Warner and Man Ray.

<doc id="1108795" wikidata="Q3527209" url="?curid=1108795" title="Hasse norm theorem">
<text>In number theory, the Hasse norm theorem states that if L/K is a cyclic extension of number fields, then if a nonzero element of K is a local norm everywhere, then it is a global norm.
Here to be a global norm means to be an element &quot;k&quot; of K such that there is an element &quot;l&quot; of L with formula_1; in other words &quot;k&quot; is a relative norm of some element of the extension field L. To be a local norm means that for some prime p of K and some prime P of L lying over K, then &quot;k&quot; is a norm from LP; here the &quot;prime&quot; p can be an archimedean valuation, and the theorem is a statement about completions in all valuations, archimedean and non-archimedean.

The theorem is no longer true in general if the extension is abelian but not cyclic. Hasse gave the counterexample that 3 is a local norm everywhere for the extension formula_2 but is not a global norm. Serre and Tate showed that another counterexample is given by the field formula_3 where every rational square is a local norm everywhere but formula_4 is not a global norm.

This is an example of a theorem stating a local-global principle. 

The full theorem is due to . The special case when the degree &quot;n&quot; of the extension is 2 was proved by , and the special case when &quot;n&quot; is prime was proved by Furtwangler in 1902.

The Hasse norm theorem can be deduced from the theorem that an element of the Galois cohomology group H2(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) is trivial if it is trivial locally everywhere, which is in turn equivalent to the deep theorem that the first cohomology of the idele class group vanishes. This is true for all finite Galois extensions of number fields, not just cyclic ones. For cyclic extensions the group H2(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) is isomorphic to the Tate cohomology group H0(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) which describes which elements are norms, so for cyclic extensions it becomes Hasse&#x27;s theorem that an element is a norm if it is a local norm everywhere.

<text>Akhand Bharat (), also known as Akhand Hindustan, is a term for the concept of a unified Greater India. It asserts that modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Tibet are one nation.

==History==

During the Indian independence movement, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi advocated for &quot;Akhand Hindustan&quot;, a proposition that Mahatma Gandhi agreed with, believing that as Britain wanted to retain their empire by pursuing a policy of divide and rule, Hindu–Muslim unity could not be achieved as long as the British were there. However, in relation to Myanmar (then Burma), Gandhi felt that it should be separate from India, regarding its inclusion in British India as a purely British legacy. In addition, Mazhar Ali Khan wrote that &quot;the Khan brothers [were] determined to fight for &quot;Akhand Hindustan&quot;, and challenged the League to fight the issue out before the electorate of the Province.&quot; On 7–8 October 1944, in Delhi, Radha Kumud Mukherjee presided over the &quot;Akhand Hindustan Leaders&#x27; Conference&quot;.

The Indian activist and Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar at the Hindu Mahasabha&#x27;s 19th Annual Session in Ahmedabad in 1937 propounded the notion of an &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; that &quot;must remain one and indivisible&quot; &quot;from Kashmir to Rameswaram, from Sindh to Assam.&quot; He said that &quot;all citizens who owe undivided loyalty and allegiance to the Indian nation and to the Indian state shall be treated with perfect equality and shall share duties and obligations equally in common, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, and the representation also shall either be on the basis of one man one vote or in proportion to the population in case of separate electorates and public services shall go by merit alone.&quot;

==Contemporary usage==
The call for creation of the &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; or &quot;Akhand Hindustan&quot; has on occasion been raised by Hindu nationalist organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Shiv Sena, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, the Hindu Sena, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, the Bharatiya Janata Party etc. One organization sharing this goal, the Akhand Hindustan Morcha, bears the term in its name.

Pre-1947 maps of India, showing the modern states of Pakistan and Bangladesh as part of British India illustrate the borders of a proto-&quot;Akhand Bharat&quot;. The creation of an &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; is also ideologically linked with the concept of &quot;Hindutva&quot; (Hindu nationalism) and the ideas of &quot;sangathan&quot; (unity) and &quot;shuddhi&quot; (purification).

The first chapter of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh textbook for standard VII students at Akhil Bharatiya Sanskrit Gyan Pariksha included a map depicting Pakistan and Bangladesh, which along with post-partition India, were territories that were part of &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; and a trade union magazine of the same organization also included Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar.

While the leadership of the right-wing BJP wavers on the issue, the RSS has always been a strong proponent of the idea. RSS leader H. V. Seshadri&#x27;s book &quot;The Tragic Story of Partition&quot; stresses the importance of the concept of &quot;Akhand Bharat.&quot; The RSS-affiliated magazine &quot;Organiser&quot; often publishes editorials by leaders such as the present Sarsanghachalak, Mohan Bhagwat, espousing the philosophy that only &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; and &quot;sampoorna samaj&quot; (united society) can bring &quot;real&quot; freedom to the people of India. The call for Indian reunification has been supported by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav.
In December 2015, following Narendra Modi&#x27;s diplomatic visit to Lahore, Pakistan, the BJP National Secretary Ram Madhav (in an interview with Al Jazeera&#x27;s Mehdi Hassan) described that &quot;The RSS still believes that one day [India, Pakistan and Bangladesh], which have for historical reasons separated only 60 years ago, will again, through popular goodwill, come together and &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; will be created.&quot; In March 2019, RSS leader Indresh Kumar claimed that Pakistan would reunite with India by 2025, that Indians would settle in and migrate to Lahore and Lake Mansarovar in Tibet, that an Indian-allied government had been ensured in Dhaka, and that a European Union-style &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; would form.

Former Indian Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju advocated in Pakistani newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot; that the only solution to the ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan is the reunification of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh under a strong, secular, modern-minded government. He expanded on the reasons for his support for a reunified India in an article for &quot;Newslaundry&quot;; Katju advocated that such a state would be administered by a secular government. Katju serves as the chairman of the Indian Reunification Association (IRA), which seeks to campaign for this cause. The former Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, in April 2004, similarly endorsed a confederation of the sovereign nations of India and Pakistan as a powerful geopolitical entity rivalling the European Union, United States of America, Russian Federation and People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Hindu nationalist political groups such as Shiv Sena, have sought the reclamation of Pakistan-administered Kashmir under the pretence of &quot;Akhand Bharat,&quot; especially after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution (removing the semi-autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir) in August 2019.

On 17 November 2020, the RSS campaigners released a calendar based on the &quot;Akhand Bharat&quot; theme. This calendar was prepared by the province patron of the Vishva Hindu Parishad in Jaipur.

In 2023, the unveiling of a mural in India&#x27;s new parliament building, said to depict a map of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka, sparked controversy and criticism from several of India&#x27;s neighbouring countries. Spokesperson for the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, criticized it as a &quot;manifestation of a revisionist and expansionist mindset&quot;, while the Bangladeshi junior minister for foreign affairs stated &quot;Anger is being expressed from various quarters over the map.&quot; Several Nepali politicians also expressed concern. While the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, Arindam Bagchi, stated it symbolized &quot;the idea of responsible and people-oriented governance that [Ashoka] adopted and propagated&quot;, other politicians in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party declared it a symbol of Akhand Bharat, with Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi tweeting &quot;The resolve is clear. Akhand Bharat&quot;.

<doc id="1108806" wikidata="Q7056651" url="?curid=1108806" title="North Shore (Greater Vancouver)">
<text>The North Shore of Burrard Inlet is a term commonly used to refer to several areas adjacent to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada:

*the District of West Vancouver 
*the City of North Vancouver
*the District of North Vancouver
*the North Shore Mountains

It is renowned for its proximity to nature, varied outdoor recreation opportunities (especially mountain biking) as well as historically significant west coast modernist architecture.

==Access==
Access to these municipalities is limited by geography. Three major bodies of water (Howe Sound to the west, Burrard Inlet to the south, and Indian Arm to the east) and the rugged peaks of the Coast Mountains to the north isolate the North Shore from the rest of the Lower Mainland.

Two road bridges (the Lions&#x27; Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway. The only other road access is by way of Highway 99 from the north or the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast.

The Canadian National Railway (CN) provides a freight rail link south to the rest of Greater Vancouver and the Lower Fraser Valley through its Second Narrows Rail Bridge–Thornton Tunnel corridor. The North Shore handles more than 40% of the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority&#x27;s international trade exports. In addition, CN controls a less-used former BC Rail line north to Prince George, British Columbia. This line was used until October 2002 for the &quot;Cariboo Prospector&quot; passenger rail service between North Vancouver and Prince George. it hosts a passenger rail route between North Vancouver and Jasper, Alberta, that is operated by Rocky Mountaineer, a private luxury rail-tour company.

The SeaBus passenger ferry, part of the TransLink transit system, connects Lonsdale Quay with downtown Vancouver.

<text>Franschhoek (; Afrikaans for &quot;French Corner&quot;, Dutch spelling before 1947 &quot;Fransche Hoek&quot;, French: &quot;Le Coin Français&quot;) is a small town in the Western Cape Province and one of the oldest towns in South Africa. It was formerly known as Oliphants hoek (as there were vast groups of elephants roaming the valley). It is situated about from Cape Town, a 45-minute drive away. The whole area, including townships such as Groendal and suburbs such as Wemmershoek, has a population of slightly over 20,000 people while the town proper, known as Hugenote, has a population of around 1,000. Since 2000, it has been incorporated into Stellenbosch Municipality. In 2022, Franschhoek was mentioned in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the top 50 places in the world to visit.

==History==
Franschhoek&#x27;s original inhabitants are the Khoisan peoples. They are now mostly extinct, but their descendants continue to live in the area as mixed race (Khoisan and French/Dutch) people. In 1685, King Louis XIV banned Protestantism in France. Hundreds of French Huguenots were forced to flee their country. In 1688, almost 300 French Huguenots arrived at the Cape of Good Hope by ship and were given the Franschhoek Valley to settle.

The French Huguenot refugees populated the valley, establishing farms and businesses, bringing with them their French culture and experience in agriculture. The name of the area soon changed to &quot;le Coin Français&quot; (&quot;the French Corner&quot;), and later to Franschhoek (Dutch for &quot;French Corner&quot;), with many of the settlers naming their new farms after the areas they had left behind in France. La Motte, Champagne, La Cotte, Cabrière, La Provence, Bourgogne, La Terra de Luc and La Dauphine were among some of the first established farms — most of which still retain their original Cape Dutch farm houses today. These farms have grown into renowned wineries. Many of the surnames in the area are of French origin, e.g. Du Toit, Marais, Du Plessis, Malan, Malherbe, and Joubert. The French settlers tried fiercely to hold onto their language, but were forced over generations by the Dutch and British colonialists through schooling to integrate into local society.

This heritage is shown today by the Huguenot Monument which stands at the end of the town. The nearby Huguenot Memorial Museum adjacent to the monument explores the history of the French Huguenots who settled in the Cape, and especially in the Franschhoek Valley. On exhibition are the various tools they used to make wine, the clothes they wore, and interpretation of their culture and goals. 

The Cape Dutch architecture in much of the village is unspoiled, as restrictions have been placed on the extent of renovations and new construction in order to preserve the spirit of the original French settlers to the area. 

In 1904, a branch line was built between Paarl and Franschhoek to serve as an alternative to ox-drawn carts for farmers wanting to get their produce to market. Steam locomotives operated along the route until diesel locomotives took over in the 1970s and then, in the 1990s, as the need for rail transport decreased, service along the railway line was discontinued. The branch line was reinstated in 2012 by a private operator and now sees service as the Franschhoek Wine Tram, a tourism project utilizing newly constructed double-decker trams modeled after the Blackpool Corporation Tramway&#x27;s Double Deck Balcony Tramcar of circa 1923 to transport tourists between wine estates in the area.

==Recent developments==

Once a quiet country retreat, the originally French settled village and region began experiencing a boom in the 1990s, and property prices increased. The ideal summer weather, snowy peaks in winter and proximity to Cape Town have turned Franschhoek (le coin Français) into one of South Africa&#x27;s most sought after residential addresses. The construction of the new English-medium private Bridge House School outside the village has also attracted many urban dwellers to the village.

Franschhoek is notable for having some of the top restaurants in the country within its borders. This fact, together with the strong wine culture, and pristine natural and architectural beauty has made Franschhoek into what many describe as the &quot;food and wine capital&quot; of South Africa. This village hosted one of the top 50 restaurants in the world The Tasting Room, according to the &quot;S.Pellegrino world&#x27;s 50 best restaurants&quot;-ranking and a famous Belgian Pâtisserie for Belgian pralines. The town hosts a number of notable restaurants and wineries such as Haute Cabrière.

The attributes of the village have turned Franschhoek into a popular tourist destination, with dozens of bed &amp; breakfasts and small cottages available for accommodation. 

The shopping experience in Franschhoek is known to be very interesting with several independent boutiques, menswear shops and quality homeware stores. The art galleries are plentiful and excellent.

Franschhoek&#x27;s weekend Bastille Festival has been celebrated every July since 1994, the year of the first South African general election with universal adult suffrage marking the end of the apartheid era.

<doc id="1108810" wikidata="Q153387" url="?curid=1108810" title="Hasan Salihamidžić">
<text>Hasan Salihamidžić (; born 1 January 1977), nicknamed Brazzo (, , &quot;Little Bro&quot;), is a Bosnian former professional footballer who last served as sporting director of Bundesliga club Bayern Munich. After starting his club career with German side Hamburger SV, he made a name for himself while playing for Bayern Munich for nine seasons with whom he won the Bundesliga title six times, DFB-Pokal title four times, the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League and the 2001 Intercontinental Cup. He also played for Italian club Juventus for four seasons.

During his career, Salihamidžić usually played as a right midfielder or full back. He was a quick and energetic player with an extremely high work rate. He was also gifted with good crossing and passing abilities, which allowed him to create chances for his teammates.

He earned 42 caps and scored six goals for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. He is regarded by many as one of the most successful Bosnian football players.

Following the end of his one-year contract with VfL Wolfsburg in 2012, Salihamidžić retired from professional football. He then worked for Sky Deutschland, RTL and ZDF, before re-joining Bayern Munich as sporting director in 2017.

== Early life ==
Salihamidžić&#x27;s father Ahmed and mother Šefika gave him the nickname &quot;Braco&quot;, meaning &quot;little brother&quot; in Bosnian, since Hasan has an older sister, hence his current nickname &quot;Brazzo&quot;. He finished elementary school and played in the local club. Then, Salihamidžić moved to Velež Mostar where he stayed until 1992. That year, Salihamidžić was called up to the Yugoslavia under-16 team, for a match against the CIS under-16 team in Belgrade. Days after the match, the Army of Republika Srpska began a siege on the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, forcing his father to look for opportunities in Western Europe for his son.

== Club career ==
=== Hamburger SV ===
In November 1992, Salihamidžić moved to Hamburg, Germany, with the assistance of Ahmed Halilhodžić (cousin of football coach Vahid Halilhodžić), who was also a Jablanica native and had emigrated to Germany. Through Ahmed Halilhodžić&#x27;s help, Salihamidžić joined the youth team of Bundesliga side Hamburger SV. He remained within the club&#x27;s youth system for three seasons before being promoted to the senior squad. In his first season with the seniors, Salihamidžić made nine appearances, scoring two league goals. The following season, Salihamidžić became an integral part of the squad as he would make 37 appearances and score an impressive seven goals between Europe and the league. He would go on to make 31 league appearances, scoring ten goals during the 1997–98 season, which would be his last for the club before his high-profile transfer to Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.

=== Bayern Munich ===
Salihamidžić&#x27;s transfer to Bayern Munich was completed during the 1998 summer transfer window, for an undisclosed fee. In his first season with his new club, 1998–99, Salihamidžić was instantly inserted into the club&#x27;s starting line-up and made an impressive 43 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals. During his first season, he came on as a substitute in the 89th minute of the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United.

Salihamidžić would make an additional 46 appearances with three more goals in his second season for the Munich giants, in 1999–2000. His third season proved very successful as well, as he would score six goals in 46 appearances. Between 2001 and 2003, however, Salihamidžić lacked in appearances, mostly due to injury; he made just 50 appearances between both seasons in all competitions.

For the 2003–04 season, the Bosnian international worked his way back into the starting line-up for the entire season, making 47 appearances and scoring five goals, also tallying 43 appearances and five goals the following season.

Salihamidžić was limited to just 29 appearances for the 2005–06 season, but made 42 seasonal appearances in his final season with the club, in which he also scored five goals. One of Salihamidžić&#x27;s most memorable plays in 2006–07 was in the Champions League round of 16 second leg against Real Madrid, where he dispossessed Roberto Carlos and fed the pass to Roy Makaay, who beat goalkeeper Iker Casillas and set the record for the fastest goal in tournament history, at 11 seconds after kickoff. This helped Bayern overcome a 3–2 loss from the first leg to level the tie at 2–1 and advance on the away goals rule.

As he spent many years being so loved in Munich and his children are from the city, Salihamidžić settled there when his playing career was over.

=== Juventus ===
On 15 January 2007, Salihamidžić signed a four-year pre-deal with Juventus. He joined them the following June after his contract with Bayern had expired. In his first season, under coach Claudio Ranieri, Salihamidžić was a regular starter, albeit with injury lay-offs, and made 30 official appearances for his new club, scoring an impressive five goals which included two in a 3–2 victory against Milan on 12 April 2008. His second and third season with the club, however, proved to be less successful as he suffered from several injury lay-offs.

In the 2010–11 season, new coach Luigi Delneri excluded Salihamidžić from the team&#x27;s plans. Along with Fabio Grosso, Salihamidžić was the only healthy first-team player that was excluded from the 25-men 2010–11 UEFA Europa League squad. Salihamidžić was released from Juventus when his contract expired in June 2011.

=== VfL Wolfsburg ===
On 4 July 2011, Salihamidžić moved to VfL Wolfsburg on a one-year contract. On 9 July 2011, in a friendly game against local team Bismark, Salihamidžić&#x27;s left arm was broken in a challenge with another player.

== International career ==
Salihamidžić made his international debut for Bosnia and Herzegovina on 8 October 1996 against Croatia. On 6 November 1996, he scored the team&#x27;s first goal in a friendly 2–1 win over Italy. During his 11 years with the national team, the closest they came was falling one goal short in a match against Denmark that would have enabled them to qualify for UEFA Euro 2004. He has earned a total of 42 caps, scoring 6 goals and his final international was an August 2006 friendly match against France.

== Punditry ==
After retiring from professional football in 2012, Salihamidžić started to work as a regular pundit for Sky Deutschland. From summer 2013 to spring 2014, he worked as a football expert for RTL and was a color commentator for during the 2013 Audi Cup. He was also an expert for ZDF from February 2014 until the UEFA Champions League Final and during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

== Administrative career ==
=== Bayern Munich ===
On 31 July 2017, Salihamidžić was appointed sporting director of Bayern Munich, following his predecessor Matthias Sammer&#x27;s withdrawal from the job for health and family reasons a season prior in 2016. Salihamidžić signed a three-year contract until 30 June 2020. Bayern&#x27;s Chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said, &quot;In Hasan, we have brought a man to FC Bayern who knows the club very well. He is a very hard-working, serious, loyal and very alert person with great integrity and he speaks five languages. His time in Italy means he has a great network that will definitely be very helpful in his job. We have complete confidence that he will be able to do the job as he should do.&quot;

Salihamidžić officially assumed his position on Bayern&#x27;s executive board on 1 July 2020 as the &quot;board director of sport&quot;.

He was sacked as sporting director on 27 May 2023.

== Personal life ==
Salihamidžić has three children: Selina, Nick and Lara June, all born in Munich, with his wife, Esther Copado. Footballer Francisco Copado is his brother-in-law, whose son Lucas (Salihamidžić&#x27;s nephew) is a footballer for Bayern Munich, alongside Salihamidžić&#x27;s own son, Nick.

Salihamidžić also holds German citizenship.

<doc id="1108811" wikidata="Q5642201" url="?curid=1108811" title="Halifax Minster">
<text>Halifax Minster is the minster church of Halifax, Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The parish church of the town, it was granted minster status in 2009. Halifax Minster is one of three churches in the county of West Yorkshire to be given this honorific title; the other two are Dewsbury Minster and Leeds Minster.

Halifax Minster, which stands on the site of an earlier Norman church, was built during the 15th century, although the Rokeby and Holdsworth Chapels were not completed until around 1530. The organ was built by John Snetzler in 1763 and installed in 1766. Other notable features of the church include a medieval font cover, Jacobean box pews, and the tombstone of 19th-century diarist Anne Lister.

==History==
The first church on this spot, thought to date from around 1120, was owned and operated by the Cluniac monks of Lewes Priory. Some portions of the stonework of this church have been incorporated into the present building – most notably the carved chevron stones in the north wall of the nave and elsewhere. It has been suggested that one section of the north wall was actually the south wall of the Norman church. Several early medieval grave covers also survive.

The present church was built in the fifteenth century, apparently fulfilling a need for &quot;more spacious accommodation for the growing population of the parish&quot;. The nave and chancel were completed around 1450. At some time between 1455 and 1480, the eastern wall was made higher to accommodate a clerestory. Work on the church tower began in the 1440s; it took over three decades to complete, as it was still under construction in 1482. The Rokeby and Holdsworth Chapels, built at the expense of former vicars William Rokeby and Robert Holdsworth, were completed around 1530. William Rokeby&#x27;s heart and bowels are buried beneath his chapel, as stipulated in his will.

Jacobean box pews are a prominent feature of the Minster, and most of those in the nave date from 1633 to 1634. A pew in the centre aisle bears the remains of a memorial brass to John Waterhouse, who died in 1539/40. The carved arms of Richard Sunderland of High Sunderland, who died in 1634, are attached to another pew. Several ancient pew nameplates may be seen attached to a board on the inner north wall of the tower, the oldest dates to 1615 and reads: &quot;This stall made at the cost of Robert Fisher of Halifax.&quot;

A small portion of medieval stained-glass survives in the upper westernmost clerestory window, which was removed from other windows in the mid-19th century. The Puritans, who were prominent in the town in the 17th century, thought stained glass with its &quot;images&quot; was an abomination. During the Commonwealth (1649–1660) many plain-glass leaded windows of a unique design were installed, paid for by Mrs Dorothy Waterhouse. Many of these were later replaced by Victorian stained glass, but those that survived in 1958 were carefully rebuilt. At that date there were three of these on each side of the chancel, but now there are five on the south side and only one on the north.

The large west window in the tower is a late 19th-century reconstruction of a Commonwealth window dating from 1657, but contains no original work. The great east window of the church depicts the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, and was completed in 1856. It is the work of George Hedgeland (1825–98), and is based on a design which won first prize for stained glass at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The remaining glass in the church dates also from the Victorian and Edwardian periods.

In 1878 and 1879 a great internal restoration of the church took place, initiated by Vicar Francis Pigou (1875–88), and carried out under the direction of George Gilbert Scott and his son John Oldrid Scott. This work involved the removal of galleries, the altering of floor levels, and the removal of plaster from the internal walls.

A more recent reordering scheme took place in 1983, when pews at the east end of the nave were removed, and a dais installed for the nave altar. At the millennium, after an appeal, Victorian pews were removed from the west end of the church, to provide a more open reception area, with adjacent fitted kitchen.

On 31 March 2007, the stand of the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding) Regulation Colours were laid up in the church. The Colour party, with 2 escorts of 40 troops, marched through Halifax from the town hall, preceded by the Regimental Drums and the Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band. There was a short ceremony in the Minster grounds where the troops were inspected by Colin Stout, the then-Mayor of Halifax, and Ingrid Roscoe, Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire.

The church was granted minster status on 23 November 2009.

==Features==
*The font cover is a feature surviving from the medieval period, and is acknowledged to be one of the finest in England. The stone font bowl may also date from the 15th century, or earlier. Before 1879 traces of paint could be seen on both font and cover, and it was once ornately gilded. The cover was originally intended to prevent people from stealing the baptismal water kept in the font, which was supposed to have curative powers.
*The wooden sedilia in the sanctuary date from the 15th century, and were restored in 1879. They contain three misericords, and were possibly brought from some nearby abbey – such as Kirkstall – after Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries.
*Six other 15th-century misericords, including a Green Man, are located under the chancel&#x27;s return stalls.
*A set of late 17th-century altar rails, with a fine double-spiral carving. The altar was first railed-in by 1665; these rails were replaced by the present &quot;twisted banisters&quot; in 1698.
*A series of painted ceiling panels, representing the heraldry of the vicars and famous families of Halifax Parish. These were originally painted by James Hoyle, and were put in place between about 1696 and 1703, but were repainted in 1815–16, and cleaned in 1948.
*Two Royal Coats of Arms of Queen Anne, dating from 1705. They were carved by John Aked.
*The alms-box is held by a life-sized wooden effigy known as &quot;Old Tristram&quot;, carved by John Aked about 1701. The carving is believed to represent a real person who once begged in the church precincts.
*The Bishop Ferrar Memorial dating from 1847 is a feature of the western wall of the south aisle. From Halifax parish, Bishop Robert Ferrar of St David&#x27;s was earlier the last prior of Nostell Priory. He was burnt at the stake at Carmarthen in 1555. The sculpture is by Joseph Bentley Leyland.
*A painted bust of John Favour (vicar 1593–1624) is adjacent to the Ferrar Monument. Favour was a celebrated physician and lawyer, and the founder of Heath Grammar School, Halifax.
*The Wellington Chapel. Halifax was the home of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, which is now the 1st battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. In 1951 the church&#x27;s south choir aisle was adopted by the Regiment as its chapel. Among the Regimental Colours previously displayed were those carried at Waterloo and those borne during the Crimean War and Abyssinian campaign. These Colours have now been placed in a protective stand of drawers that will remain in the church.
*A pulpit on wheels. This was given in 1879 in memory of Archdeacon Charles Musgrave (vicar 1827–75), by members of his family.
*The recently rediscovered tombstone of Anne Lister of Shibden Hall (1791–1840), a noted local diarist. The stone is damaged and is currently in the Rokeby Chapel.
*On the west wall near the tower is a list of former rectors and vicars. The most famous were Hubert Walter, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Rokeby, who became Archbishop of Dublin.

==Organ==
The church houses an organ built by John Snetzler, installed in 1766. The organ has been enlarged several times in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was completely rebuilt in 1928 by Harrison &amp; Harrison of Durham. Only a small amount of the Snetzler work remains in the present instrument.

<text>Giovanni Savarese (born July 14, 1971) is a Venezuelan football manager and former player. He last served as the head coach for the Portland Timbers.

== Club career ==
===Professional Breakthrough===
Savarese made his professional debut at 15, with Venezuelan club Deportivo Italia during the 1986–87 season. He remained with the club through the 1988–89 season, scoring six goals that year.

===Move to the United States===
In 1990, Savarese moved to the United States to play college soccer at Long Island University Brooklyn, while joining the storied amateur club Greek-American Atlas of the Cosmopolitan Soccer League during the long collegiate off-season. He became one of the top scorers in school history with LIU, scoring 50 goals for the Blackbirds in his career. After college, Savarese signed with the Long Island Rough Riders of the USISL along with future MLS stars Tony Meola and Chris Armas, winning the league championship in 1995, a season in which he was also named league MVP.

===MetroStars===
Drafted by the New York/New Jersey MetroStars in the 9th round of the MLS Inaugural Player Draft, Savarese scored the first goal in club history in its inaugural match against the LA Galaxy on 13 April 1996. Savarese proved a prolific scorer during the 1996 season, scoring the next seven goals for the MetroStars and cementing his place in the team sheet. Savarese spent three seasons with the MetroStars, setting the long-standing club record for career goals in league play at 41, as well as the club scoring record across all competitions at 44. His record for league goals was broken in 2009 by Juan Pablo Angel. Savarese became a fan favorite, despite coming off the bench for long stretches of time. 

===New England Revolution===

On January 20, 1999, Savarese was traded to the New England Revolution along with a second-round pick in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft in exchange for Raúl Díaz Arce. Savarese made an immediate impact on his new club, scoring his first goal in the first match of 1999 season, against the Miami Fusion on March 28. He made his home debut on April 10 against DC United, coming on as a 76th minute substitute for Brian Dunseth. In total, Savarese would make 27 appearances for the Revolution in 1999, recording 10 goals and 2 assists, second in scoring only to Joe-Max Moore.

===Additional Clubs===
Departing MLS to sign for Serie A club Perugia in early 2000, Savarese spent his first stint in Europe loaned to Serie C club Viterbese for half a season, without being recalled to the Italian top division. He returned to MLS later in 2000 as a mid-season signing for the San Jose Earthquakes, but failed to score in four appearances that year. His luck improved after returning to Europe with Welsh club Swansea City in the English Second Division, tallying 14 goals across all competitions.

Savarese briefly transferred to Millwall before returning to his native Venezuela and signing for his boyhood club Deportivo Italia, then renamed Deportivo Italchacao.

After becoming an assistant coach at St. John&#x27;s University, Savarese trialed with the MetroStars in 2003, but could not earn a place on the team. Following a sojourn back to Italy with Sassari Torres, he ended his playing career back in New York with the Rough Riders, then part of the USL Second Division.

==Managerial career==
===MetroStars/Red Bulls===
Savarese re-joined the MetroStars organization in 2005 as head of the club&#x27;s successful youth development program, maintaining his role with through the Red Bull ownership transition before a philosophical conflict with the new management heralded his firing in March 2007.

===New York Cosmos===
In August 2010, Savarese joined the New York Cosmos as Cosmos Academy director, with a focus on developing youth talent in New York in preparation for the club&#x27;s return to professional competition.

The Cosmos announced the promotion of Savarese to head coach on 19 November 2012. He quickly signed Long Island native Carlos Mendes as the modern club&#x27;s first player in preparation for the team&#x27;s debut in the NASL&#x27;s 2013 Fall season. On 3 August 2013, the Cosmos defeated the Fort Lauderdale Strikers 2–1 in the team&#x27;s first professional match. During the 2013 season, Savarese led the Cosmos to an undefeated record at home (W-D-L: 5–2–0) and winners of the 2013 NASL Fall Season title with an overall record of 31 points from 14 games (W-D-L: 9–4–1). The Cosmos would cap the season with an appearance in the 2013 championship match, where they defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks 1–0.

In 2014, Savarese managed the Cosmos to second place in the Spring season, finishing behind Minnesota by just 1 point. The Cosmos also took part in the U.S. Open Cup with Savarese leading the team to a convincing 3–0 fourth-round win over the New York Red Bulls in New York City&#x27;s first-ever professional soccer derby on 14 June. The Cosmos would fall to eventual runners-up, the Philadelphia Union on 24 June in a 2–1 overtime defeat at PPL Park. After the end of the 2014 season, Savarese was offered the chance to interview for the vacant Houston Dynamo head coaching position. He declined, preferring to stay with the Cosmos.

In 2015, Savarese led the Cosmos to an undefeated Spring, earning the title for the first half of the season. The team also defeated New York City FC in the US Open Cup in the first meeting between the two clubs. The Cosmos defeated the Ottawa Fury 3–2 in the 2015 NASL Championship Final to win their second league title since returning to professional competition.

The Cosmos were runners-up in the 2016 Spring season, but rallied to claim the Fall title by ten points, and with it the combined season table. Savarese&#x27;s club defeated Indy Eleven on penalty kicks in the 2016 NASL Championship Final, despite scheduling conflicts which forced the club to host the match at Belson Stadium in front of just 2,150 fans. Following the 2016 season, Savarese emerged as a finalist for the head coaching job with MLS expansion club Minnesota United FC. Talks with the new franchise fell apart when the Cosmos insisted on a transfer fee for releasing Savarese from the remainder of his contract, and the position went to Adrian Heath instead.

After the 2016 season ended, the Cosmos nearly folded, terminating all player contracts. Savarese took it upon himself to leverage his network of contacts to find new teams for his former players. When the Cosmos were sold to a new investor, ensuring their survival, Savarese turned to re-signing many of the players who had been let go.

Following the tumultuous off-season, the 2017 season proved the roughest yet for Savarese and the Cosmos as they struggled through the regular season and lost in the opening round of the U.S. Open Cup to NPSL club Reading United AC. Despite draws in 9 of 16 Fall season matches, the Cosmos qualified for the playoff and upset the top-seeded Miami FC away on penalty kicks. The Cosmos season ended in a 2–0 loss to San Francisco Deltas in the playoff final.

On December 13, 2017, the Cosmos announced that Savarese would leave the club &quot;to pursue other coaching opportunities&quot;.

===Portland Timbers===
On December 18, 2017, Savarese was announced as the head coach of the Portland Timbers, the third head coach in their MLS history.

Under Savarese, Portland made the postseason four times in five full seasons, including losses in MLS Cup 2018 and 2021. His five and a half years at the helm in Portland represented the longest coaching tenure for the club in the MLS era. On August 21, 2023, the Timbers announced they had let go of Savarese.

==International career==
Born in Venezuela, Savarese is of Italian descent. He earned 30 caps for Venezuela, scoring 10 goals – including 3 in World Cup qualifiers. His most notable goal was against Argentina in 1996.

==Broadcasting==
Giovanni Savarese worked as a soccer analyst for ESPN International and ESPN Deportes.

<doc id="1108818" wikidata="Q16014360" url="?curid=1108818" title="Rowe Industries">
<text>Rowe Industries was a manufacturer of guitar pickups and other music-related devices, as well as electrical components utilized in the aerospace industry into the 1980s.

Owner Horace &quot;Bud&quot; Rowe established a working relationship with budding electrical component designer Harold &quot;Harry&quot; DeArmond (January 28, 1906 – October 12, 1999). DeArmond is credited with developing the first commercially available detachable guitar pickup. 

==Rowe-DeArmond collaboration==
===Early developments===
Harold &quot;Harry&quot; DeArmond (January 28, 1906 – October 12, 1999) was an industrial designer of electrical components. His younger brother John was a budding guitarist at age 10 but wanted to make his guitar louder and better-sounding, and in 1935 created a magnetic pickup using components from the ignition coil of a Ford Model A. Harry realized the commercial potential of such a device, and began developing the idea into something commercially feasible. In part to support this undertaking, he founded DeArmond Research, at 4124 Secor Road in Toledo, Ohio (West Toledo), which he operated until the 1960s. One of his early contracts was as a design consultant for small manufacturing firms owned by entrepreneur Horace Rowe, a relationship that lasted through 1975.

In 1931, Rowe founded his first company, Fox Electrical and Manufacturing, located at 3120 Monroe Street in Toledo, Ohio. Among other commercial directions, Fox manufactured small electric motors, which required the tooling to create coils of insulated copper wire. DeArmond interested Rowe in turning the company&#x27;s knowledge of coil winding to the building of guitar pickups. The name was changed to Fox Sound Equipment Corporation in 1935. A pickup-building operation was soon opened.

Bud Rowe consolidated his companies in 1940 as Rowe Industries, under which it operated through 1970.

===The first DeArmond pickups===
The first RH (&quot;round-hole&quot;) and FH (&quot;F-hole&quot;) guitar pickups were constructed in 1939. &quot;Mounted within a metal casing, …six Alnico II pole pieces on a bakelite spool&quot; with a coil of 42-gauge copper wire. (That same year, John DeArmond, age 14, hopped a train to California, where he worked as a musician until he was able to join the Navy.)

The RH was designed to fit into the opening of a standard (&quot;round hole&quot;) guitar, with a wire clip at one end and two adjustable spring-steel arms at the other, making the device readily removable. To avoid interfering with performance, the device projected only a few millimeters above the soundboard.

The FH model had a significantly different appearance. One end of the metal-cased coil assembly fitted onto a 1/8&quot; steel rod (called the &quot;pressure rod&quot; by the manufacturer), itself mounted parallel to the guitar&#x27;s strings a short span away from the sixth (or &quot;low E&quot;) string; this allowed the player to adjust the pickup&#x27;s location for preferred tonal character and for minimal interference with performance. The end of the pressure rod was clamped across the strings between the guitar&#x27;s bridge and tailpiece assemblies. The configuration was soon nicknamed &quot;monkey on a stick&quot; because of a resemblance to a popular child&#x27;s toy of the era. As with the RH model, the FH could easily be installed and removed without modification (or damage) to the instrument. Later, an option was offered with a shorter pressure rod intended to be attached to the side of the guitar&#x27;s neck with two small screws; this provided less interference with the guitarist&#x27;s right hand as well as an aesthetically &quot;cleaner&quot; appearance.

Each pickup models was offered in a variant — the RHC and FHC respectively — that had a volume-control potentiometer. The FHC-B has a twelve-foot cable but no volume control, being intended for use with a volume pedal. The FHC-C had a volume control (potentiometer) in a small box on the cable, ten inches from the pickup.

The pressure-rod pickup design originally used an output cable with a threaded female connector on one end and a 1/4&quot; plug on the other, a common configuration for high-impedance microphones of the era. The connector (Amphenol 80-75-MC1F, Switchcraft 2501F) had a knurled coupling ring, which allowed the fitting to attach to a corresponding male-threaded connector on the volume box or &quot;module&quot; which completed the signal path to the amplifier. The plastic insulation of the cables became stiff or brittle with age, prompting players to repair or replace these themselves in order to keep using the pickup. Eventually, DeArmond replaced the one-piece (twelve-foot) integral cables and the threaded connectors with a 1/8-inch phono jack on the pickup and provided an 1/8&quot;-plug-to-1/4&quot;-plug cable.

===The Rhythm Chief===
DeArmond introduced model 1000, the &quot;Rhythm Chief&quot; archtop guitar pickup, in 1948. This was followed late 1953 by the model 1100 &quot;Adjustable Rhythm Chief&quot; with individual polepiece screws and a fancier look (chrome plating, and later, gold plating). The 1100 was presented to the public along with the introduction of the 210, the adjustable-pole soundhole model. 

===Tap-style guitar===
To promote the sensitivity of his pickups, Harry DeArmond developed a fretboard-tapping technique for guitar performance, creating notes with hammer-on and pull-off rather than picking, and sometimes playing two guitars simultaneously.

DeArmond&#x27;s method was adopted by Jimmie Webster, a designer and demonstrator for Gretsch Guitars. Webster wrote a brief instruction book in 1952, popularized the technique in his travels, and in 1959 recorded an LP, &quot;Webster&#x27;s Unabridged: Jimmie Webster&#x27;s Stereo Guitar&quot; (RCA Victor LPM-1942).

===The &quot;gold foil&quot; and 2000 models===
In the 1950s, with the increasing popular interest in &quot;electrified&quot; guitars, some manufacturers turned to Rowe Industries rather than expending resources on making their own pickups. As a result, Harry DeArmond is best known for pickups used on inexpensive &quot;beginner&quot; instruments as well as quality guitars.

Most widely distributed were the so-called &quot;gold foil&quot; pickups, primarily installed in inexpensive Harmony Company guitars. Generally, these have a chrome-plated metal casing, with cut-out shapes (leading to further colloquial naming: diamond, S, moustache, scroll, and more), beneath which was placed a metalized plastic shim, for aesthetic reasons as well as to simply keep dust away from the pickup&#x27;s inner parts. Being very simple in design, most of these pickups had no height adjustment, and often needed to be installed on some sort of a riser or pedestal to achieve optimum distance from the strings. Though widely scorned for years, these &quot;cool&quot;-impedance pickups eventually achieved popularity, in part because of the unique tone imparted by the heavy steel mounting plates. (The &quot;gold foil&quot; pickups were sometimes called &quot;Golden Tone&quot; pickups in catalogue copy; these should not be confused with the later &quot;Goldtone&quot; two-coil humbucking pickups.)

Among the finest — and most complex — DeArmond pickups were the Model 2000. These are best known for appearing on better models of Gretsch guitars, where they were called the Dynasonic (or sometimes DynaSonic, later renamed the FidelaTone so as not to clash with Rogers Drums over their Dyna-Sonic snare). These feature a moderately complex system of individual polepiece height adjustment, with the result that the steel components account for part of the pickup&#x27;s unique tonal characteristics.

Harmony and Gretsch were the most important DeArmond customers. Besides them Rowe Industries pickups (including pressure-rod models) were factory installed by a wide range of other brands: C.F. Martin &amp; Company used DeArmonds on their electrified D-18E and D-28E models. Other brands include Airline, D&#x27;Angelico, Eko, Epiphone, Fender, Galanti, Guild, Hofner, Kustom, Levin, Meazzi, Messenger, Micro-Frets, Premier, Silvertone, and Standel. 

===Effects devices and amplifiers===
In 1941, Rowe Industries introduced the world&#x27;s first effects unit intended specifically to modify the sound of an electric guitar. The floor-based Model 601 Tremolo Control contained a 120V AC motor that rocked a small sealed bottle fitted with two electrical contacts and containing electrically conductive fluid. The variable frequency of the &quot;make and break&quot; action of the mechanism created a type of tremolo effect. Bo Diddley and many other artists used this device. A foot-pedal version, the Model 800 Trem Trol followed in 1948, greatly reducing the awkward bulk of the 601.

In the early 1960s, Rowe Industries created a line of guitar amplifiers, including a series for C. F. Martin &amp; Company.

Seeing a rising market for relatively simple (yet profitable) effects devices, in the later 1960s Rowe increased output of new effects-box models,
&quot;the Square Wave Distortion Generator and the DeArmond Wa-Wa pedal. The DeArmond Weeper… Wa-Wah pedal. …three versions of phase shifters including the model 1900 Pedal Phasor, the model 1920 Tornado Phase Shifter and the model 1930 Twister Phase Shifter.&quot;

===Legacy===
Harry DeArmond retired in 1976, by which time his company had designed and manufactured over 170 different pickups for a wide range of stringed instruments, and many amplifiers and effects units. DeArmond and Rowe each received multiple patents, which were utilized far beyond the music industry, including widely in the aerospace industry: &quot;During the 1960s, in addition to their music-related products, Rowe Industries produced components for radar, aerospace and missile defense systems, including the Nike-Hercules missile, the Nike-X, the Apollo moon shot and the B-52 communications system.&quot;

A DeArmond pickup was used by guitarist Vic Flick on a 1939 English Clifford Essex Paragon De Luxe guitar recording the original James Bond Theme at CTS studios in Bayswater, London.

==Later use of trade names==
Around 1998, Fender had acquired interests in various brands, including Guild Guitars and the DeArmond name. Fender launched a line of import Guild guitars from Korea and Indonesia under the DeArmond brand. The better Korean guitars had Dynasonic-style pickups also branded as DeArmond, and made in the United States, but there was no tangible connection to Rowe Industries or Harry DeArmond. The later &quot;2K&quot; pickups (subsequently appearing on models of Fender guitar) looked cosmetically like the Model 2000 but were just single-coil pickups, as is true of almost all subsequent copies.

<text>Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr (665–714) (), also known as Abū ‘Abd Allāh, was originally from Kufa, in modern-day Iraq. He was regarded as one of the leading members of the Tabi&#x27;in (d. ca. 712). Sa&#x27;īd is held in the highest esteem by scholars of the Shi&#x27;a and Sunni Islamic tradition and was considered one of the leading jurists of the time. He also narrated several hadith from Ibn Abbas.
==Life==
Originally from Africa, in Abyssinia, or from Koufa (the sources differ, it could be that it was his ancestors who came from Africa). , formerly a slave, he was the freedman of the Banû Wâlibah, a clan of the Banû Asad Ibn Khuzaymah tribe. At the battle of Jamājim in 82 AH (699-701), Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath and his followers, including 100,000 from amongst the mawāli, took on the army of al-Hajjāj (d. 714), the governor of the Iraqi provinces during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik. Within their forces was a group known as the &#x27;Battalion of Qur&#x27;an Reciters&#x27; headed by Kumayl ibn Ziyad an-Nakha`i and including Sa`īd ibn Jubayr. The revolt was brutally put down and Sa`īd was forced to flee to the outskirts of Mecca. He persisted in travelling to Mecca itself twice a year to perform the hajj and `umrah and would enter Kufa secretly to help resolve peoples&#x27; religious issues. He also was the first men to be associated with blindfolded chess games. 

==Dialogue between Ibn Jubayr and al-Hajjaj==
Sa&#x27;īd was finally apprehended and brought before al-Hajjāj. Excerpts from a transcript of their dialogue follows:Sa&#x27;īd ibn Jubayr entered upon al-Hajjāj, who asked his name (and he knew his name well):

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;Sa&#x27;īd ibn Jubayr.&quot;

:Al-Hajjaj: &quot;Nay, you are Shaqīy ibn Kusayr.&quot; (al-Hajjāj is playing with words here: Sa&#x27;īd means happy and Shaqī means unhappy; Jubayr means one who splints broken bones and Kusayr means one who breaks them.)

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;My mother knew better when she named me.&quot;

:Al-Hajjāj: &quot;You are wretched (shaqīta) and your mother is wretched&quot; (shaqiyat). Then he told him: &quot;By Allah, I will replace your dunya with a blazing Fire.&quot;

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;If I knew you could do it, I would take you as a God.&quot;

:Al-Hajjāj: &quot;I have gold and wealth.&quot;

Bags of gold and silver were brought and spread before Sa&#x27;īd ibn Jubayr in order to try him.
:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;O Hajjāj, if you gathered it to be seen and heard in showing off, and to use it to avert others from the way of Allah, then by Allah, it will not avail you against Him in any way.&quot; Saying this, he aligned himself towards Qiblah.

:Al-Hajjāj: &quot;Take him and turn him to other than the Qiblah. By Allah, O Sa&#x27;īd ibn Jubayr, I will kill you with a killing with which I have not killed any of the people.&quot;

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;O Hajjāj choose for yourself whatever killing you want, by Allah you will not kill me with a killing except that Allah will kill you with a like of it, so choose for yourself whatever killing you like.&quot;

:Al-Hajjāj: &quot;Turn him to other than the Qiblah.&quot;

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;Wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah&quot;.

:Al-Hajjāj: &quot;Put him under the earth.&quot;

:Sa&#x27;īd: &quot;From it (the earth) We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time&quot;.

Al-Hajjāj was outdone and ordered the beheading of Sa&#x27;īd ibn Jubayr. Sa&#x27;īd was martyred in the month of Sha&#x27;bān, 95 AH (ca. May 714) at the age of 49. Al-Hajjāj is reported to have soon lost his senses and died within a month.

==Legacy==
===Sunni view===
 writes:
From him are recorded by Imams Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasa&#x27;i, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maja, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Imam Malik ibn Anas. Sa&#x27;id narrates 147 traditions in Sahih Bukhari and 78 in Sahih Muslim.

===Shia view===
According to &quot;Khulasat al-aqwal&quot; by Al-Hilli and &quot;Rijal al-Kashshi&quot; by Muhammad ibn &#x27;Umar al-Kashshi he was a Shia Muslim. They point out, among many, that Sa&#x27;id ibn Jubayr was a follower and companion of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, supported the Alid rebellion against the Umayyads, for which he was killed by the Umayyad appointed Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf.

Sa&#x27;id was asked by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to write a book concerning Quranic exegesis. His exegesis is mentioned by Ibn al-Nadim in his &quot;al-Fihrist&quot; under Shiite exegeses, without mentioning any other exegesis that is temporally prior to it.

His mausoleum is located in al-Hay city in the Wasit Province of Iraq. In Iraq, Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal 25 of every year is recognized as the anniversary of Sa&#x27;id ibn Jubayr&#x27;s martyrdom. On this day people congregate in his mausoleum and honor the day. His mausoleum is a pilgrimage site for the Shia Muslims.

<doc id="1108821" wikidata="Q2006897" url="?curid=1108821" title="Josip Katalinski">
<text>Josip Katalinski (12 May 1948 – 9 June 2011) was a Bosnian professional football manager and player.

==Club career==
Katalinski&#x27;s career began in a small club Igman based in Ilidža, a suburb of Sarajevo. In 1964, when he was 15 years old, he was spotted by Željezničar coaches who offered him to join their club&#x27;s youth system. He accepted the offer and a year later made his debut for the first team. Katalinski stayed with Željezničar for 11 seasons, during which he made 230 league appearances and scored 32 league goals. In total, he played more than 350 games for Željezničar, scoring more than 100 goals. He was a crucial player on the team that won the Yugoslav First League in the 1971–72 season.

In 1975, Katalinski signed a contract with French Ligue 1 club Nice where he played over 100 league matches before his career was abruptly cut short in 1978 due to a severe injury.

==International career==
As a youngster, Katalinski played for the junior team of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later for the Yugoslav junior national team (12 caps), as well as the Under-21 national team (18 caps). In 1972, he made his debut for the senior Yugoslavia national team. Over the next five years, he collected 41 caps and scored 10 goals.

One of the most famous moments of his career came during the play-off match of the 1974 World Cup qualifiers against Spain at Waldstadion in Frankfurt. Katalinski scored the only goal of the game and secured Yugoslavia&#x27;s appearance at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, after the team had failed to qualify for the 1966 and 1970 editions. This goal propelled Katalinski to new heights, as he was proclaimed a &#x27;national hero&#x27;. He was a member of the Yugoslav squads at the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 1976. His final international was a May 1977 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Romania.

==Managerial career==
Katalinski worked as a youth coordinator for the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also worked as a fitness coach at several clubs, and, at one time, was the vice president at his favourite club Željezničar.

In 1998, he was, briefly, the head coach of Čelik Zenica.

==Death and memorial==
On 9 June 2011, Katalinski died in Sarajevo, aged 63, after a long illness. In his memory, the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been organizing the &quot;Josip Katalinski-Škija Memorial Tournament&quot; for youth teams since June 2012. In May 2024, the 12th edition of this memorial tournament was held in Sarajevo.

<text>Nihonjinron (: &quot;treatises on Japaneseness&quot;) is a genre of ethnocentric nationalist literary work that focuses on issues of Japanese national and cultural identity. &quot;Nihonjinron&quot; posits concepts such as Japanese being a &quot;unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race&quot;, and has been described as racist.

&quot;Nihonjinron&quot; literature flourished during a publishing boom popular after World War II, with books and articles aiming to analyze, explain, or explore Japanese culture and cultural mindset.

==History==

Hiroshi Minami traces the origin of nihonjinron to before the Edo period.

The roots of the nihonjinron be traced back at least to the (&quot;national studies&quot;) movement of the 18th century, with themes that are not dissimilar to those in the post-war nihonjinron.

===Kokugaku===

Kokugaku, beginning as a scholarly investigation into the philology of Japan&#x27;s early classical literature, sought to recover and evaluate these texts, some of which were obscure and difficult to read, in order to appraise them positively and harvest them to determine and ascertain what were the original indigenous values of Japan before the introduction of Chinese civilization. Thus the exploration of early classical texts like the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; allowed scholars of Kokugaku, particularly the five great figures of Keichū (1640–1701), Kada no Azumamaro (1669–1736), Kamo no Mabuchi (1697–1769), Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) and Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843) to explore Japan&#x27;s cultural differences with China, locate their sources in high antiquity, and deploy the results in a programmatic attempt to define the uniqueness of Japan against a foreign civilization. These scholars worked independently, and reached different conclusions, but by the 19th century were grouped together by a neo-Kokugakuist named Konakamura to establish the earliness of Japanese self-awareness. Chinese cultural beliefs, social rites and philosophical ideas exercised a political ascendancy for over a millennium within Japan, and informed the neo-Confucian ideology of the Tokugawa regime.

===Meiji period===

In the second half of the 19th century, under strong military and diplomatic pressure, and suffering from an internal crisis that led to the collapse of the Bakufu, Japan opened its ports, and subsequently the nation, to commerce with the outside world and reform that sought to respond vigorously to the challenges of modern industrial polities, as they were remarked on by Japanese observers in the United States and Europe. The preponderant place of China as model and cultural adversary in the cognitive models developed hitherto was occupied by the West. But, whereas Japan&#x27;s traditional engagement with Chinese civilization was conducted in terms of a unilateral debate, now Japanese scholars and thinkers could read directly what Westerners, themselves fascinated by the &#x27;exoticism&#x27; of Japanese culture, said and wrote of them. Japanese contact with, and responses to these emerging Western stereotypes, which reflected the superiority complex, condescension and imperial hauteur of the times, fed into Japanese debates on national identity. As Leslie Pincus puts it, speaking of a later phase:

There ensued an intense period of massive social and economic change, as, under the direction of a developmental elite, Japan moved from the closed world of centuries of Tokugawa rule (the so-called &quot;sakoku&quot; period) to Meiji Westernization, and, again in close conformity with the prevailing occidental paradigm, to imperialist adventurism with the growth of the colonialism. The Taishō period marked a slightly more &#x27;liberal&#x27; turn, as the pendulum swung towards a renewed interest in the Western model (&quot;Japan must undergo a second birth, with America as its new mother and France as its father&quot;). With the crisis of 1929 and the concomitant depression of the 1930s, militarism gained the upper hand in this era of the , and nationalistic ideologies prevailed over all attempts to keep alive the moderate traditions of liberal modernity.

===Postwar period===

Total economic, military and spiritual mobilization could not stave off defeat however, and slowly, under occupation, and then rapidly with its reasserted independence, Japan enjoyed a decades-long resurgence as global industrial and economic powerhouse until the crisis of the 1990s. The cultural patterns over this century long trajectory is one of a continuous oscillation between models of pronounced Westernization and traditionalist autarky. Between the two alternatives, attempts were frequently made to mediate a conciliatory third way which would combine the best of both worlds: .

The frequency of these chronic transitional upheavals engendered a remarkable intensity of debate about national directions and identity ( &quot;kokuminsei&quot;; &quot;minzokusei&quot;), whose complexity over time renders a synthetic judgment or bird&#x27;s-eye view of the literature in question rather difficult. A major controversy surrounds the question regarding the affiliation of the post-war nihonjinron theories with the prewar conceptualization of Japanese cultural uniqueness. To what degree, that is, are these meditations under democracy on Japanese uniqueness innocent reflections of a popular search for identity, and in what measure, if any, do they pick up from the instrumental ideology of Japaneseness developed by the government and nationalists in the prewar period to harness the energies of the nation towards industrialization and global imperium?

The questions are rendered more complex by the fact that in the early post-war period, the restoration of a &#x27;healthy nationalism&#x27; was by no means something exclusive to right-wing cultural thinkers. An intense debate over the necessity to develop ideal, positive forms of national consciousness, regarded as a healthy civic identity, figures prominently in the early writings of Maruyama Masao, who called for a healthy , and in the prolific debates of members of the who preferred to speak of . These debates ranged from liberal center-left critics to radical Marxist historians.

Some scholars cite the destruction of many Japanese national symbols and the psychological blow of defeat at the end of World War II as one source of nihonjinron&#x27;s enduring popularity, although it is not a uniquely 20th century phenomenon. In fact the genre is simply the Japanese reflex of cultural nationalism, which is a property of all modern nations. The trend of the tone of nihonjinron argument is often reflective of the Japanese society at the time. Dale, defines three phases in the development of post-war &quot;nihonjinron&quot; discourse in the period covered by Nomura: Tamotsu Aoki subsequently finessed the pattern by distinguishing four major phases in the post war identity discourse.

During the early post-war period, most of nihonjinron discourses discussed the uniqueness of the Japanese in a rather negative, critical light. The elements of feudalism reminiscent of the Imperial Japan were all castigated as major obstacles to Japan&#x27;s reestablishment as a new democratic nation. Scholars such as Hisao Ōtsuka, a Weberian sociologist, judged Japan with the measure of rational individualism and liberal democracy that were considered ideals in the U.S. and Western European nations back then. By the 1970s, however, with Japan enjoying a remarkable economic boom, Ōtsuka began to consider the &#x27;feudal residues&#x27; in a positive light, as a badge of Japan&#x27;s distinctive difference from the West (Ōtsuka, Kawashima, Doi 1976 passim). Nihonjinron books written during the period of high economic growth up to the bubble burst in the early 1990s, in contrast, argued various unique features of the Japanese as more positive features.

====As cultural nationalism====

Scholars such as Peter N. Dale (1986), Harumi Befu (1987), and Kosaku Yoshino (1992) view nihonjinron more critically, identifying it as a tool for enforcing social and political conformity. Dale, for example, characterizes nihonjinron as follows:

The emphasis on ingroup unity in &quot;nihonjinron&quot; writings, and its popularization during Japan&#x27;s period of military expansion at the turn of the 20th century, has led some Western critics to brand it a form of ethnocentric nationalism. Karel van Wolferen echoes this assessment, observing a collectivism prevalent in the society.

====Specific theses====

# The Japanese race is a unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race. In some extreme versions, the race is claimed to be directly descended from a distinct branch of primates.
# This isolation is due to the peculiar circumstances of living in an cut off from the promiscuous cross-currents of continental history, with its endless miscegenation of tribes and cultures. The island country in turn enjoys a whose peculiar rhythms, the supposed fact for example that Japan alone has , color Japanese thinking and behaviour. Thus, human nature in Japan is, peculiarly, an extension of nature itself.
# The Japanese language has a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague. Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language&#x27;s thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view.
#Japanese psychology, influenced by the language, is defined by a particular cast of that conduce to a unique form of , in which clearly defined boundaries between self and other are ambiguous or fluid, leading to a psychomental and social ideal of the .
# Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic characterized by , , and . As a result, the cannot properly exist, since will always prevail.

<text>The Mexican Grand Prix (), currently held under the name Mexico City Grand Prix (), is a motor racing event held at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City. It first appeared as a non-championship event in 1962 before being held as a championship event in 1963–1970 and 1986–1992. The Grand Prix returned in at the Mexico City circuit, and held the event from 2015 to 2019, and since 2021; it was due to host the Grand Prix in 2020, but this was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The venue is contracted to host the event until 2025.

==History==

===Magdalena Mixhuca (1962–1970)===

The Mexican Grand Prix was first held on 4 November 1962 at the Magdalena Mixhuca circuit. The circuit was the first international racetrack in Mexico, and like Monza in Milan, Italy, it was built within a park in the center part of a major city, in this case the Mexican capital of Mexico City. The race provided unique challenges for racing, standing at 2,240m (7,340 ft) above sea level, as well as the long, 180-degree, lightly banked and fast Peraltada corner that finishes the lap, in addition to being a bumpy racetrack from actively shifting soils beneath the circuit. The Mexican Grand Prix of this period was always the season finale Grand Prix, held in late October.

The first race, a non-championship affair which attracted a strong international entry, was won by Team Lotus with Jim Clark taking over the car of teammate Trevor Taylor to claim the win; Clark was black-flagged after receiving a push-start at a confused race start. The meeting was marred by the death of young Mexican star Ricardo Rodríguez, killed in practice in a Rob Walker run Lotus 24 on the Peraltada.

The Formula One World Championship arrived the following year with Clark winning again, equalling Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s record of most victories in a single season. 1964 saw the battle for both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; championships. British drivers Clark, John Surtees and Graham Hill all arrived with a chance, with Hill leading the table, and Ferrari, BRM and Lotus were in contention for the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Ferrari signalled Lorenzo Bandini to let teammate Surtees through, which he did, and Surtees finished second behind Gurney to win the championship by one point; Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

American Richie Ginther took victory for Honda in 1965, the Japanese company&#x27;s first win in Formula One. Clark won his third Mexican Grand Prix in 1967, making him the most frequent winner of the race as of 2019.

In 1968, three men again came into the race with a chance of winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship: Hill, his countryman Jackie Stewart, and New Zealander and defending world champion Denny Hulme. The race was a straight fight between Hill and Stewart; the Scotsman led for several laps until Hill passed him. Hulme was running third, but he had a rear suspension failure and crashed on Lap 11. Swiss Jo Siffert decided to get in on the mix and took the lead, but he had to pit with a broken throttle cable. Stewart then fell back when his engine started to misfire, and he experienced handling and fuel-feed problems. Hill had no problems and took victory and his second driver&#x27;s championship.

Crowd control in 1968 and 1970 contributed to cancellation of the event. In 1970, a record crowd of approximately 200,000 arrived to see Pedro Rodríguez, forcing officials to delay the race start by an hour as they struggled to control the crowd. At one point, a dog ran across the track and was hit by Stewart. During the race, spectators threw bottles on the track. Amid the chaos, Clay Regazzoni trailed Jacky Ickx for a 1-2 Ferrari finish.

The 1971 event was scheduled, with a large fund deposited in a Swiss bank to help guarantee better crowd control, but after the death of Pedro Rodriguez, the plan was abandoned.

===Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (1986–1992)===

 There had been a number of attempts to bring the Mexican Grand Prix back on the F1 calendar, one attempt being when it was originally scheduled in April 1980, two weeks after the US Grand Prix West, but was cancelled. American IndyCars arrived for a brief two-year visit in 1980 and 1981, racing as the Gran Premio Tecate on the Magdalena Mixhuca track now named after Mexico&#x27;s two lost racing heroes, Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. The event was dominated by Rick Mears. A number of years later, work began on rebuilding the Hermanos Rodríguez circuit with much improved organisation. The circuit&#x27;s layout was slightly shorter, the Peraltada&#x27;s banking had been eased and the circuit was generally much safer than it had been. The Grand Prix returned in 1986, where the race played host to Austrian Gerhard Berger&#x27;s first win in his Benetton B186, in a race where an ill Berger outlasted his opposition, as tyre problems struck most of the field. The circuit was still very rough and bumpy. 1987 saw the race being run in two parts. It was stopped around mid-distance when Briton Derek Warwick crashed heavily coming out of the Peraltada. Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet finished first on the road, but because his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell was 30 seconds ahead when the first race ended, Mansell kept Piquet in sight and won the race on cumulative time.

The 1988 race was moved from mid-October to a warmer and more rain-prone late May season slot, so that it could be paired with the other North American Grands Prix in Montreal and Detroit. This race saw Frenchman Alain Prost dominate in his McLaren, and Prost&#x27;s Brazilian teammate Ayrton Senna won the next year; this was at a time when the two men&#x27;s relationship was at a low point. 1990 saw the race moved to late June. Prost, now at Ferrari, qualified 13th on the grid but drove through the field and took second from his teammate Mansell late in the race. Senna, who was leading, had a slow puncture that turned into shredded rubber, and he went into the pits to have it changed, but the suspension was too badly damaged for the Brazilian to continue. This put Prost and Mansell 1–2, but Senna&#x27;s teammate Gerhard Berger was challenging Mansell for second; Berger passed the Englishman going into the Moises Solana esses, but Mansell repassed him around the outside of the Peraltada on the same lap. Prost won the race; Mansell and Berger finished second and third. 1991 saw Senna crash heavily at the Peraltada during practice; he was declared fit to race by FIA doctor Sid Watkins; he finished third behind Williams drivers Riccardo Patrese and Mansell; but Senna had been critical of the severely bumpy circuit all of that weekend. On 9 October 1991, European media sources reported that promoters barely made enough funds to pay off F1 for the 1991 race. FISA demanded improvements to the track for the 1992 event, which were made.

For the 1992 season, the race had been moved further forward to March, and on 20 February of that year, Mexico City&#x27;s air pollution had reached a record level. City officials had imposed emergency measures banning half of government cars and equipment from the streets; this was not helped by the fact that Mexico City is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, which restricts polluted air to travel elsewhere to dissipate. This put extra stress on the Mexican Grand Prix committee to ensure the track was ready for 1992. Some safety measures had been implemented to the track, including further easing of the banking at Peraltada, making the corner a little slower; this was done to avoid bypassing the entry to this corner via making an alternate route to the middle of the Peraltada through the park&#x27;s baseball stadium. Although the circuit was popular with drivers, they complained during interviews with the press about the ubiquitous and severe bumps on the circuit, which had decayed even further and were worse than before - even the Peraltada was very bumpy and Mansell nearly crashed there during practice. Despite these concerns, the race that year went ahead and saw Williams teammates Mansell and Patrese dominate the race. Senna had another bad accident during practice, this time at the fast Esses - Senna went over a nasty series of bumps that unsettled the car to the point where Senna lost control, went off the track and hit a concrete wall; he had minor injuries but qualified sixth and took part in the race. But the state of the track, the decline of Mexico City itself, not only with air pollution problems but also a rapid and unstable city population increase, saw Formula One leave again.

===Absence (1993–2014)===

2002 saw the revival of the Grand Prix of Mexico for Champ Cars on a much modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit, which included cutting the Peraltada in half. This was a six-year stay, which saw Sébastien Bourdais win half of the six races that followed.

Rumors first surfaced in 2003 that the Mexican Grand Prix might return to the Formula One calendar at a new $70 million circuit, dubbed &quot;Mantarraya&quot;, to be built near Cancún. In 2005, the governor of Quintana Roo state said that Mexico would have a Grand Prix on the calendar for . The plan was halted later that year as a debate arose about whether the land the circuit was to be built on was properly owned by the right people to do so.

After the 2006 United States Grand Prix, Bernie Ecclestone announced that the Grand Prix of Mexico would return for the season, but nothing further came from the announcement.

===Return to the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (2015–2019, 2021–present)===

In August 2011, Carlos Slim Domit revealed plans for a revived race. In August 2013, it was suggested by &quot;high level sources&quot; that the Mexican Grand Prix could be on the provisional 2014 World Championship calendar. A preliminary draft calendar for the 2014 season, circulated in early September 2013, assigned 9 November 2014 for the Mexican Grand Prix, but did not specify a circuit and noted that the event was &quot;subject to confirmation&quot;. On 5 December 2013, the FIA released the official 2014 Formula One season calendar, and the Mexican Grand Prix was not on the calendar; then the FIA announced that the Mexican Grand Prix was postponed to 2015 due to lack of sufficient preparation time to upgrade the somewhat run-down Hermanos Rodríguez circuit to Formula 1 working standards. In July 2014, Ecclestone confirmed that he had signed a 5-year deal for the Hermanos Rodríguez track to host the Mexican Grand Prix, starting in 2015. On 3 December 2014, the FIA published a confirmed calendar for 2015 showing the 2015 Grand Prix of Mexico on 1 November 2015. German Nico Rosberg won the 2015 event in his Mercedes.

On 14 May 2019, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced that 2019 would be the last year for the Grand Prix of Mexico because the MXN $400 million (US$20.865 million) fee was to be invested in the Tren Maya. It is estimated that the race generates MXN $8,400 million to the local economy. However, on 8 August it was announced that the Mexican Grand Prix would remain on the calendar until 2022, though it would be renamed to &quot;Mexico City Grand Prix&quot;, in order to emphasize the support from the government of Mexico City.

The 2020 edition was scheduled on 1 November under the name of &quot;Mexico City Grand Prix&quot;, but cancelled on 24 July because of travel restrictions in the Americas (along with the other races in North and South America). The 2021 event therefore became the first event to take place under the Mexico City Grand Prix moniker.

On 28 October 2022, it was announced that the Mexico City Grand Prix had signed an extension to stay on the calendar until 2025.

<text>The Ford Squire is a car that was produced by Ford UK from 1955 to 1959.

It was a two-door, four-seat estate design, related to the Ford Prefect 100E four-door saloon, sharing the same Ford sidevalve engine and other parts and the same interior trim. It was substantially shorter than both the Prefect and the closely related Ford Anglia 100E two-door saloon. It used the short front doors of the four-door model because the bodyshell was optimized for use as a panel van (which was marketed as the Thames 300E). The rear door was in two pieces split horizontally. The rear seat could be folded flat to convert from a four-seater to a load carrier. Until 1957 there were wood trim pieces screwed to the sides of the vehicle.

The Squire competed in the same market segment as the Hillman Husky and Austin A30 / A35 based estate, both significantly more popular in the UK than longer estates at the time. Total production was 17,812 cars.

British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; tested a Squire in 1955, recording a top speed of , 0- in 20.2 seconds, and a fuel consumption of . The test car (with the optional heater) cost £668, including taxes.

The Ford Escort was a mechanically identical estate car with the lower trim level of the Ford Anglia. This proved more popular, and a total of 33,131 Escorts were produced between 1955 and 1961. Production of the Escort continued until 1961, two years longer than the Squire. 

The Escort name was later used by Ford of Europe in 1968 on another small car, and a North American variant was introduced in 1980.

<text>The District of North Vancouver is a district municipality in British Columbia, Canada, situated north of the city of Vancouver across the Burrard Inlet. It surrounds the respective City of North Vancouver on three sides, and the remaining fellow North Shore municipality of West Vancouver on the other, and is part of the Metro Vancouver Regional District.

It is largely characterized as a relatively quiet, affluent suburban hub home to many middle and upper-middle-class families. Homes in the District of North Vancouver generally range from mid-sized family bungalows to very large luxury houses. A number of dense multi-family and mixed-use developments have popped up across the district in recent years; however, the district remains a primarily suburban municipality. It is served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, British Columbia Ambulance Service, and the District of North Vancouver Fire Department.

==History==

For thousands of years, the Indigenous Squamish and their kin Tsleil-Waututh, of the Coast Salish, resided in the land known as North Vancouver. Slightly over 200 years ago, the people of the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh living on the North Shore had their first glimpse of Europeans. First, the Spanish arrived, giving their name to Vancouver&#x27;s Spanish Banks, and, in 1792, Captain George Vancouver explored the local shores. But it was not until 1862 that the first attempt was made to harvest the North Shore&#x27;s rich stands of timber, leading to fuller settlement of the area that would later become North Vancouver.

The first industry on the North Shore was Pioneer Mills, founded in 1862 to log the huge trees of the coastal rainforest. After twice changing hands, the operation was bought by Sewell (&quot;Sue&quot;) Prescott Moody in 1865. Near where the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool grain elevators now stand, the town of Moodyville grew up and stood as the main centre of activity on the North Shore until the mill closed in 1901. The first school was established in Moodyville. The second, Central School, opened in 1902 in a building that still stands as part of what is now Presentation House at 3rd Street and Chesterfield Avenue, the current home of the North Vancouver Museum and Archives.

In 1891, the first municipality on the North Shore was formed as the District of North Vancouver. It stretched across the North Shore from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove but omitted Moodyville. In the early years of the 20th century, a real estate boom took place, with speculators – including the British poet Rudyard Kipling – eager to turn a quick dollar. A new community began to take shape. In 1902, the Hotel North Vancouver was built; in 1905, the first bank, a branch of the Bank of North America, opened. A newspaper, the Express, commenced publication in 1905, and in 1906 the British Columbia Electric Railway began streetcar service.

Industry, particularly shipbuilding, became central, with the nearby stands of trees a rich resource for a society in which ships, houses, and most other manmade things were constructed mainly of wood. The Wallace Shipyards moved in 1906 to the area just east of Lonsdale Avenue, drawn by the arrival of electricity. Over the years, this company, later known as Burrard Dry Dock and then Versatile Pacific Shipyards, became a major force in the local economy. Many of the shipyard&#x27;s buildings still stand although the company has now ceased operations.

Economic prosperity and rapid growth in the Lower Lonsdale area of North Vancouver led to the establishment in 1907 of the separate City of North Vancouver, with a population of approximately 1,500. West Vancouver separated from the district in 1912. Apart from the addition of Moodyville in 1915, the boundaries of the city have not changed, even though far more people now call the district home.

Communications with Vancouver have always been an important factor in the development of the North Shore. The first ferry service was supplied by &quot;Navvy Jack’s&quot; rowboat in 1866. In 1867, the Sea Foam established a regular ferry service that continued until 1958. The SeaBus re-established water transportation in 1977. Rail service was slower in developing. While the Pacific Great Eastern Railway inaugurated a 12.7-mile run from North Vancouver to Whytecliff Park in 1914, it was not until the completion of the first Second Narrows Bridge in 1925 that rail and road links with the Lower Mainland supplemented the local ferry service.

Early plans for North Vancouver were ambitious. However, early grandiose plans met with a number of setbacks. The real estate boom was overtaken by a worldwide depression in 1913 and then World War I delayed many projects. The depression that began in 1929, coupled with disruptions to communications over the Second Narrows caused by ships colliding with the bridge, led to economic difficulties and severe tax shortfalls. Both the city and the district were placed in receivership in 1933. But the opening of the second road crossing, the Lions Gate Bridge, in 1938 was a significant factor in making the North Shore more accessible. And the war years led to an economic revival of North Vancouver, especially because of the many ships built in the Burrard Dry Dock at the foot of Lonsdale for the Canadian war effort.

In the postwar years, the city and the District of North Vancouver boomed, with most of the growth taking place in the district because of its greater land resources.

Since 2018, there have been proposals to amalgamate the District of North Vancouver with the City of North Vancouver into a single North Vancouver. Surveys have shown that the majority of the municipalities&#x27; residents support the idea, and many do not even know that the city and the district are separate entities.

==Geography==

The District of North Vancouver is separated from Vancouver by the Burrard Inlet. It can be accessed by the Lions&#x27; Gate Bridge, the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, and the SeaBus passenger ferry.

The district is bounded by the Capilano River to the west, Indian Arm to the east, Burrard Inlet to the south, and the Coast Mountains to the north. It sprawls in an east–west direction across the mountain slopes and is characterized by rugged terrain and steep and winding roadways. While there is no true urban core within the district, there are a number of separate commercial neighbourhood centres. These include (from west to east): Edgemont Village, Upper Lonsdale, Lynn Valley, Main Street, Parkgate, and Deep Cove.
The district has much in common with West Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver. Together, these three municipalities are commonly referred to as the North Shore. Most of the residents of the district live in single-family dwellings. Except for a few more historical areas, much of the development of the district has occurred since the 1950s. The City of North Vancouver has considerably higher commercial and residential density.

===Climate===
North Vancouver has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate type &quot;Cfb&quot;). 
==Government and politics==
==Industry==
While industry was the engine that propelled North Vancouver for much of the twentieth century, this has now largely been replaced by enterprises more in tune with present economic realities. Many North Shore companies are in the business of creating and marketing high technology.

The television and film industry has made the area the centre of Hollywood North. Filming of the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; took place in North Vancouver for five seasons, with many of its &quot;wilderness&quot; sequences shot in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve (LSCR).

==Transportation==
The main (and only) highway through the District of North Vancouver is the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). This crosses over the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing from Vancouver and goes through the district to the western border with West Vancouver.

Public transit is provided by TransLink and is mostly operated by its subsidiary Coast Mountain Bus Company, which runs a network of bus routes throughout the North Shore municipalities, including the R2 Marine Dr, as well as buses connecting the municipality with the rest of the Metro Vancouver. The SeaBus ferry, which is part of the TransLink system, is also an integral part of the district; it stops at Lonsdale Quay, which connects the North Shore with Vancouver, and Waterfront station, which connects to the SkyTrain network. West Vancouver Blue Bus also runs a few routes in the two North Vancouvers, along with the 255, which connects them to West Vancouver. There currently is no rapid transit system in North Vancouver, but TransLink aims to build a bus rapid transit line from Metrotown in Burnaby to Park Royal in West Vancouver as a measure to bring rapid transit to the traffic-congested North Shore.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, North Vancouver had a population of 88,168 living in 32,700 of its 34,179 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 85,649. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="1108837" wikidata="Q829350" url="?curid=1108837" title="Bera, Count of Barcelona">
<text>Bera () (died 844) was the first count of Barcelona from 801 until his deposition in 820. He was also the count of Razès and Conflent from 790, and the count of Girona and Besalú from 812 (or 813 or 817) until his deposition. In 811, he was witness to the last will and testament of Charlemagne.

==Origins==
Bera&#x27;s origins are mostly unknown, although it seems certain that he was a Visigoth. He may have been one of the sons of William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse and cousin of Charlemagne, although this is not supported by William&#x27;s detailed will from 804. In 790, Bera was given the governorship of the counties of Razès and Conflent, possibly by William. The Counties of Roussillon (with the &quot;pagus&quot; of Vallespir) and Empúries were given to William&#x27;s son Gaucelm, whose mother was Gunegunde (Cunegonde), one of William&#x27;s two wives.

==Background and installation==
In 796, Sa&#x27;dun al Ruayni, the Wali of Barcelona, attempted to break his allegiance to Al-Hakam I, emir of Córdoba. In April 797, he travelled to Aachen and offered to switch the city&#x27;s allegiance to Charlemagne in exchange for help against Córdoba. Charlemagne summoned an assembly in Toulouse in the spring of 800 which agreed to send his son Louis the Pious to Barcelona.

The army included a number of noble men, among them Rostany of Girona, Adhemar of Narbonne, and William of Toulouse. Sa’dun, however, had changed his mind and the Frankish forces laid siege of Barcelona. Eventually, starving and with Sa’dun having been captured by the Franks trying to reach Caliphate of Cordoba in a plea for help, the city&#x27;s Visigoth population handed the new Wali Harun over to the Franks with their surrender on Saturday, April 3, 801. Louis entered the city on the following day. Soon after, Bera, who was part of the besieging army, was invested as the first Count of Barcelona.

==Expeditions across the Ebro==
Bera took part in the Frankish campaigns in 804, 808, and 809 to extend the southern border of the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; to the River Ebro which was felt to be a natural defendable barrier between the two empires. This was despite his Visigoth mother who urged him to keep peace with the Muslims States to the south and west.

===First expedition===
In 804, Louis the Pious led an army to Tarragona. At Santa Coloma, the army divided into two. Louis marched his division straight for Tortosa while the other commanded by Bera, Adhemar, and Borrell of Ausona covered Louis&#x27; western flank and attacked Tortosa from the south. Bera turned his army around after they had crossed the River Ebro where it meets the Cinca. The army went as far as Vila Rubea before being forced to turn back to Vallis Ibana (this is possibly modern Vallibona), near Morella. They then rejoined the troops commanded by Louis&#x27;s which has unsuccessfully undertaken a siege of Tortosa. The army then turned north and returned to Barcelona.

===Second and third expeditions===

In 808, Charlemagne sent his legate Ingobert to Toulouse to meet Louis and prepare for another expedition south. The plan was to follow the same tactics as in 804. The &quot;Astronomer&quot;, author of the &quot;Vita Hludovici&quot;, writes that the forces of Bera and Adhemar crossed the Ebro in boats while their horses swam across. However, the horse dung was swept by the current past Tortosa which alerted the town&#x27;s garrison. The Wali of the city attacked Bera, who was forced to retreat north again.

In 809, Louis led his last expedition as King of Aquitaine into the &quot;Marca&quot;. This time equipped with siege engines, Tortosa was besieged for forty days by Frankish and troops from the Marca (under Bera). The new Emir of Cordoba, Abd ar-Rahman II, however met the besiegers with an army. The Moorish chronicler Al Maqqari records a Muslim victory, while Astronomus simply states that the besieged offered Louis&#x27;s the keys to the city and, satisfied, the King of Aquitaine lifted his siege and left.

==First truce==
It is probable that Bera was the strongest promoter of peace with Córdoba. This would allow him to consolidate his power in his new possessions. Advised by his mother, and supported by the city&#x27;s residents keen for continued peaceful relations with the nearby Muslim states, Bera sought to institute a truce. The Frankish court eventually signed a three-year peace treaty with the Caliphate of Córdoba in 812.

Bera&#x27;s father died on 18 May 812 and the Counties of Razès and Conflent passed to him. Following his father&#x27;s example, Bera gave governorship of the counties to his son Guillemundus.

In 812, Bera also travelled to the Imperial Court in Aachen with several other Counts of the region: Adhemar of Narbonne, Gaucelm of Roussillon, Odilo of Girona, Guiscafred of Carcassonne, Ermengar of Empúries, Laibulf of Provence, and Erlin of Béziers. Several Visigoth (&quot;hispani&quot;) nobles had accused the Counts of Frankish paternity and of imposing unjust tributes and excises on their lands. The Magnates defence was unsuccessful and Charlemagne decided in favour of the claimants

==Second truce and downfall==
Around 813, Count Odilo of Girona and Besalú died and these Counties passed to Bera.

In 815, the truce with the Caliphate was broken and the war with the Muslims resumed. The Muslim army under the command of Ubayd Allah Abu Marwan, uncle of the Emir Al-Hakam I, attacked Barcelona. However, the attack was beaten back by a mercenary Visigothic army. This victory increased the prestige of Bera, whose relationships with the local Visigoth nobility improved. In November 816, the Wali of Zaragoza travelled to Aachen and negotiated a new three-year truce, which was finally concluded in February 817.

However, despite attempts to secure alliances in Pamplona, the Basques remained allied to the Banu Qasi family based in the valley of the River Ebro. They continued to defy Frankish authority, as did Aragón, where the Count was allied with the Basques. Gaucelm and his brother Bernard both claimed that the truce promoted by Bera was against the Empire&#x27;s best interests and inhibited attempts to force the Basques and Aragón to recognise themselves as vassals of the Empire.

In February 820, a general assembly was held in Aachen at which Bera was in attendance. Gaucelm sent his Visigoth lieutenant Sanila in his place, who accused Bera of infidelity and perfidy. The litigation, as was customary in that era, was settled by a duel in the palace. Bera was defeated by Sanila and deprived of his counties. However Emperor Louis I, who did not believe the Count was a traitor, commuted the death penalty carried by the defeat into an exile in Rouen. He remained there until his death in 844. He was succeeded as Count of Barcelona by Rampon.

<doc id="1108841" wikidata="Q559997" url="?curid=1108841" title="Blaž Slišković">
<text>Blaž &quot;Baka&quot; Slišković (; born 30 May 1959) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player. He is regarded as one of the most successful Bosnian football managers.

As a player, Slišković was capped 26 times for Yugoslavia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After retiring from playing, he became a successful manager. In July 2011, French football manager and former player, Zinedine Zidane, named Slišković as one of his idols while growing up and included him in his &quot;&quot;All Time Best 11&quot; of Marseille.

==Club career==
During his playing days, Slišković was considered one of the most technically gifted players of his generation. In 1985, he was named the Yugoslav Footballer of the Year. He had the most success while playing for hometown club Velež Mostar and Croatian club Hajduk Split. With Velež, Slišković won the 1980–81 Yugoslav Cup and the 1980–81 Balkans Cup, while with Hajduk he won the 1983–84 Yugoslav Cup and was also part of the Hajduk team that made it all the way to the semi-finals of the 1983–84 UEFA Cup.

Slišković was most famous while playing for French Ligue 1 club Marseille. After Marseille, Slišković played in Italy with Pescara, before returning to France and playing for Lens, Mulhouse and Rennes. In 1992, he returned to Italy and came back to Pescara. In 1993, Slišković left Italy and joined Croatian club Hrvatski Dragovoljac, where he stayed until 1995. Finally, in 1996 he joined Bosnian club Zrinjski Mostar, where he eventually finished his career in 1997 at the age of 38.

In 2011, for the 100th anniversary of Hajduk Split, Slišković was chosen in the &quot;Hajduk Split Best 11 of all-time&quot;&quot;.

==International career==
Although most experts expected Slišković to make a great international career, he was only capped 26 times for Yugoslavia. He scored three goals in the process. Slišković was prevented from playing in the 1982 FIFA World Cup due to an injury, sustained in the second half during a 1981–82 Yugoslav First League match between OFK Beograd and Hajduk Split. He then lost his place in the UEFA Euro 1984 Yugoslav squad after, allegedly, a Yugoslav-printed newspaper journalist quoted Slišković incorrectly after an interview after a friendly game between Yugoslavia and Switzerland (0–2) and caused the national team head coach, Todor Veselinović, to drop him from the squad. His final international was a November 1986 European Championship qualification match away against England.

Slišković began to play for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. He played three unofficial friendly games for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993 as the captain in all three games.

==Managerial career==
Right after ending his playing career, Slišković became the new manager of Hrvatski Dragovoljac in 1997. He managed Dragovoljac until 1998, after which he joined Zrinjski Mostar. In January 1999, Slišković joined Brotnjo and won the Herzeg-Bosnia Cup with the club in May of that same year.

In the winter of 2000, he left Brotnjo and became an assistant manager to Mišo Smajlović in the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. Slišković became the head coach of the national team in March 2002, after Smajlović left the team because of his contract expiring. Slišković stayed as the head coach until 2006. In 2004, he won the award &quot;Best Bosnia and Herzegovina Coach&quot; by &quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; and the &quot;Bosnia and Herzegovina Man of the Year&quot; also in 2004. While Bosnia and Herzegovina head coach, on 24 August 2004, Slišković replaced Ivan Katalinić and simultaneously became the new Hajduk Split manager. On 10 April 2005, he got sacked at Hajduk.

From 2005 until 2007, Slišković once again managed Zrinjski Mostar, making decent results. By the summer of 2008, he was appointed manager of Albanian Superliga club Tirana, but shortly after left the club in December of that year. In March 2010, Romanian club Unirea Alba Iulia hired Slišković until the end of the season, replacing Adrian Falub. In April 2011, he again came back to Bosnia and Herzegovina taking the manager position at Bosnian Premier League club Široki Brijeg, reaching the fourth position in the 2010–11 Bosnian Premier League season and qualifying for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.

On 19 January 2012, Chinese Super League side Qingdao Jonoon announced that they signed a contract with Slišković to replace South Korean manager Chang Woe-ryong. From April to June 2015, he once again managed Široki Brijeg.

In March 2017, Slišković again took the manager position at Zrinjski Mostar for the third time in his career, eventually leading the team to win the Bosnian Premier League in the 2016–17 season. In the 2017–18 season, he won his second league title in a row with Zrinjski. After winning two league trophies, Slišković left Zrinjski in June 2018. However, after the sacking of new manager Ante Miše, the club asked Slišković to return, which he agreed to on 13 August 2018. After the end of the 2018–19 Bosnian Premier League season, it was announced on 7 June 2019 that Slišković did not come to an agreement with the board of directors of Zrinjski on a contract extension and that he was leaving the club.

Shortly after leaving Zrinjski, on 3 July 2019, Slišković became the new manager of Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee, signing a two-year contract. On 23 March 2020, he stepped down and transitioned to a consultancy role with the club.

After Amar Osim got sacked as manager by Bosnian Premier League club Željezničar on 11 April 2021 due to poor results, three days later, on 14 April, Slišković was named as its new manager. In his first game as manager, Željezničar drew against Radnik Bijeljina on 18 April 2021. Slišković oversaw his first loss as Željezničar manager on 25 April 2021, in a league game against Olimpik. In his first ever Sarajevo derby, Slišković&#x27;s Željezničar lost against FK Sarajevo away in a league match on 1 May 2021. Slišković left Željezničar after his contract with the club expired in June 2021.

==Personal life==
Slišković was born in Mostar, FPR Yugoslavia, present day Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 30 May 1959 to Bosnian Croat parents. He was married to Bosnian Serb handball player Svetlana Kitić. Slišković&#x27;s father Vladko played for Velež Mostar for 15 years. Slišković&#x27;s son Vladimir is also a professional football manager.

<doc id="1108844" wikidata="Q3351379" url="?curid=1108844" title="Indian Youth Congress">
<text>The Indian Youth Congress is the youth wing of the Indian National Congress party. The Indian Youth Congress was a department of the Indian National Congress from the period just after the Partition of India in 1947 until the late 1960s. While prime minister, Indira Gandhi gave the Youth Congress a new dimension by establishing it as a frontal organisation of the Congress Party, with the objective of doing social work. Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi was the first president of the Indian Youth Congress who later became Minister of Broadcasting and Parliamentary affairs in the Indian cabinet; Narayan Dutt Tiwari was the first President. Jitin Prasada was also the president of the Indian youth congress.

During the 1970s, under the leadership of Sanjay Gandhi, the Youth Congress undertook activities such as tree plantation, family planning, and fought against domestic violence and dowry deaths. After the death of Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi took over in charge of the Youth Congress. After he became prime minister in 1984, Rajiv Gandhi reduced the voting age to 18. Rahul Gandhi was appointed a general secretary of the All India Congress Committee on 24 September 2007 and was given charge of the Indian Youth Congress along with the National Students Union of India.

The Indian Youth Congress has its headquarters in New Delhi and is headed by Uday Bhanu Chib. There are 39 office bearers at the national level, followed by the state, Loksabha, Assembly and Booth level. In all, 174,000 committees have been formed at the Booth level.

==History==
In the early seventies, the Youth Congress was mostly the work of Saiyid Nurul Hasan, who served as the education minister from 1972 to 1977. The organisation&#x27;s most effective unit was the West Bengal Youth Congress, where its first elected president, Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, who transformed the unit into a fulltime cadre, made it a body not to be ignored.

During the Emergency, the organisation became an important body in the use of Sanjay Gandhi. The banning of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh helped with adding members from the banned organisation.

==Role in India==
===UTI Scam rally protest===
In 2001, several Youth Congress workers held Lalkar Rally around Parliament of India to protest against UTI Scam under National Democratic Alliance government and asked for resignation of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
===Protest against violent attacks===
In 2011, 2,500 Youth Congress activists rallied and protested in Calcutta against the violent attacks on its supporters by the All India Trinamool Congress party.

===Tripura civil disobedience movement===
In 2012, Tripura Pradesh Youth Congress organized civil disobedience movement in all 23 sub-divisions in Tripura as part of agitation to protest against the Left Front government&#x27;s failure to provide employment, nepotism, rise of crime and atrocities against women in the state. This saw procession of 4,000 Congress workers and detainment about 25,000 Youth Congress activists across the state.

===Madhya Pradesh memorandum===
Kunal Choudhary is the President of Madhya Pradesh Youth Congress. In 2012, Madhya Pradesh Youth Congress president submitted a memorandum to the Governor of Madhya Pradesh demanding dismissal of the State Government run by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not able to protect teenager girls and murders.

===Karnataka drought failure===
In 2012, Youth Congress workers of Karnataka took out a procession in protest against the failure of the Government of Karnataka under BJP to tackle drought in 123 taluks and staged a mass protest in front of all taluk offices and locked the offices. A memorandum was submitted to Deputy Commissioner.

In January 2013, a 17 kilometer rally was held in Kannur demanding the dissolution of BJP government for &#x27;failing&#x27; to provide good administration and losing the support of the majority.

===India-Pakistan border protest for Indian soldiers===
On 14 January 2013 more than hundred Youth Congress activists staged protests across India against Pakistan and its army outside the old customs gate at the Attari border over the killing of two Indian soldiers by Pakistani forces.

===Implementation of 73rd and 74th Amendments in Jammu and Kashmir===
In August, 2012 the Pradesh Youth Congress Jammu and Kashmir launched a statewide protest against the Government led by National Conference for the implementation of the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution of India relating to Panchayti Raj in Jammu and Kashmir. The protests were led by J&amp;K youth Congress president Mohammad Shahnawaz Choudhary.

===Kisaan Satyagrah against Land Acquisition Ordinance===
In January 2015, Indian National Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi directed nationwide protest against Land Acquisition Ordinance brought in by Indian Central government. The protest took place in various part of country. On 18 February, Indian Youth Congress protested against Vyapam Scam and Land Acquisition Ordinance near Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha where they were charged with water canon in which several youth congress volunteers were hurt and arrested along with Indian Youth Congress National President Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.

<doc id="1108858" wikidata="Q2121171" url="?curid=1108858" title="Reporting mark">
<text>A reporting mark is a code used to identify owners or lessees of rolling stock and other equipment used on certain rail transport networks. The code typically reflects the name or identifying number of the owner, lessee, or operator of the equipment, similar to IATA airline designators.

In North America, the mark, which consists of an alphabetic code of two to four letters, is stenciled on each piece of equipment, along with a one- to six-digit number. This information is used to uniquely identify every such rail car or locomotive, thus allowing it to be tracked by the railroad it is traveling over, which shares the information with other railroads and customers. In multinational registries, a code indicating the home country may also be included.

==Standard practices==

===North America===
The Association of American Railroads (AAR) assigns marks to all carriers, under authority granted by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, Transport Canada, and Mexican Government. Railinc, a subsidiary of the AAR, maintains the active reporting marks for the North American rail industry.

Under current practice, the first letter must match the initial letter of the railroad name. As it also acts as a Standard Carrier Alpha Code, the reporting mark cannot conflict with codes in use by other nonrail carriers.

Marks ending with the letter &quot;X&quot; are assigned to companies or individuals who own railcars, but are not operating railroads; for example, the TTX Company (formerly Trailer Train Company) is named for its original reporting mark of TTX. In another example, the reporting mark for state-funded Amtrak services in California is CDTX (whereas the usual Amtrak mark is AMTK) because the state transportation agency (Caltrans) owns the equipment used in these services. This may also apply to commuter rail, for example Metrolink in Southern California uses the reporting mark SCAX because the equipment is owned by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority—which owns the Metrolink system—even though it is operated by Amtrak. This is why the reporting mark for CSX Transportation, which is an operating railroad, is CSXT instead of CSX. Private (non-common carrier) freight car owners in Mexico were issued, up until around 1990, reporting marks ending in two X&#x27;s, possibly to signify that their cars followed different regulations (such as bans on friction bearing trucks) than their American counterparts and so their viability for interchange service was impaired. This often resulted in five-letter reporting marks, an option not otherwise allowed by the AAR.

Companies owning trailers used in trailer-on-flatcar service are assigned marks ending with the letter &quot;Z&quot;, and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, which maintains the list of Standard Carrier Alpha Codes, assigns marks ending in &quot;U&quot; to owners of intermodal containers. The standard ISO 6346 covers identifiers for intermodal containers.

When the owner of a reporting mark is taken over by another company, the old mark becomes the property of the new company. For example, when the Union Pacific Railroad (mark UP) acquired the Chicago and North Western Railway (mark CNW) in 1995, it retained the CNW mark rather than immediately repaint all acquired equipment. Some companies own several marks that are used to identify different classes of cars, such as boxcars or gondolas. If the acquiring company discontinues the name or mark of the acquired company, the discontinued mark is referred to as a &quot;fallen flag&quot; railway. Occasionally, long-disused marks are suddenly revived by the companies which now own them. For example, in recent years, the Union Pacific Railroad has begun to use the mark CMO on newly built covered hoppers, gondolas and five-bay coal hoppers. CMO originally belonged to Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, a predecessor of the CNW, from which the UP inherited it. Similarly, during the breakup of Conrail, the long-retired marks of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and New York Central Railroad (NYC) were temporarily brought back and applied to much of Conrail&#x27;s fleet to signify which cars and locomotives were to go to CSX (all cars labeled NYC) and which to Norfolk Southern (all cars labeled PRR). Some of these cars still retain their temporary NYC marks.

A railway vehicle must be registered in the relevant state&#x27;s National Vehicle Register (NVR), as part of which process it will be assigned a 12-digit European Vehicle Number (EVN). The EVN schema is essentially the same as that used by the earlier UIC numbering systems for tractive vehicles and wagons, except that it replaces the 2-digit vehicle owner&#x27;s code (see ) with a 2-digit code indicating the vehicle&#x27;s register country. The registered keeper of a vehicle is now indicated by a separate Vehicle Keeper Marking (VKM), usually the name of the owning company or an abbreviation thereof, which must be registered with the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF) and the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) and which is unique throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Northern Africa.

The VKM must be between two and five letters in length and can use any of the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. Diacritical marks may also be used, but they are ignored in data processing (for example, &quot;Ö&quot; is treated as though it is &quot;O&quot;).

The VKM is preceded by the code for the country (according to the alphabetical coding system described in Appendix 4 to the 1949 convention and Article 45(4) of the 1968 convention on road traffic), where the vehicle is registered and a hyphen. Some examples:

When a vehicle is sold it will not normally be transferred to another register. The Czech railways bought large numbers of coaches from ÖBB. The number remained the same but the VKM changed from A-ÖBB to A-ČD.

=== Europe 1964 to 2005 ===

The UIC introduced a uniform numbering system for their members based on a 12-digit number, largely known as &quot;UIC number&quot;. The third and fourth digit of the number indicated the owner, or more precisely the keeper of the vehicle. Thus each UIC member got a two-digit owner code. With the introduction of national vehicle registers this code became a country code. Some vehicles had to be renumbered as a consequence. The Swiss company BLS Lötschbergbahn had the owner code 63. When their vehicles were registered, they got numbers with the country code 85 for Switzerland and the VKM BLS. Example for an &quot;Einheitswagen&quot; delivered in 1957:
* delivered as BLS B 831
* renumbered with UIC number 50 63 20-33 801-5
* rebuilt 1991 and renumbered 50 63 20-33 705-4 
* registered as 50 85 20-35 451-7 CH-BLS

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, prior to nationalisation, wagons owned by the major railways were marked with codes of two to four letters, these codes normally being the initials of the railway concerned; for example, wagons of the Great Western Railway were marked &quot;G W&quot;; those of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway were marked &quot;L M S&quot;, etc. The codes were agreed between the railways and registered with the Railway Clearing House.

=== India ===
In India, wagons owned by the Indian Railways are marked with codes of two to four letters, these codes normally being the initials of the railway divisions concerned along with the Hindi abbreviation; for example, trains of the Western Railway zone are marked &quot;WR&quot; and &quot;प रे&quot;; those of the Central Railway zone are marked &quot;CR&quot; and &quot;मध्य&quot;, etc. The codes are agreed between the railways and registered with the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.

<doc id="1108867" wikidata="Q465872" url="?curid=1108867" title="Meena Keshwar Kamal">
<text>Meena Keshwar Kamal (Pashto/; 27 February 1956 – 4 February 1987), commonly known as Meena, was an Afghan revolutionary political activist, women&#x27;s rights activist and founder of Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), who was assassinated in 1987.

==Biography==

Meena was born to an educated Kabuli Pashtun family. In 1977, when she was a student at Kabul University, she founded Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), an organization formed to promote equality and education for women that continues to &quot;give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan&quot;. Despite the Saur Revolution and women&#x27;s rights being placed high on the Democratic Republic&#x27;s agenda, Kamal felt that there was no vast changes of women&#x27;s deprivation in Afghanistan. In 1979 she campaigned against the government, and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, she launched a bilingual feminist magazine, &quot;Payam-e-Zan&quot; (Women&#x27;s Message). She also founded Watan Schools to aid refugee children and their mothers, offering both hospitalization and the teaching of practical skills.

At the end of 1981, by invitation of the French Government, Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the French Socialist Party Congress. The Soviet delegation at the Congress, headed by Boris Ponamaryev, left the hall as participants cheered when Meena started waving a victory sign. She would eventually move and base her RAWA organization in Quetta, Pakistan, in opposition to the Afghan Marxist government.

== Personal life ==

Kamal was married, in 1976, to Afghanistan Liberation Organization leader Faiz Ahmad, who was murdered in Peshawar, Pakistan, by agents of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar on 12 November 1986. Meena was executed less than 3 months afterwards. They had three children, whose whereabouts are unknown.

==Assassination==

Kamal was assassinated in Quetta, Pakistan on 4 February 1987. Reports vary as to who the assassins were, but are believed to have been agents of the Afghan Intelligence Service KHAD, the Afghan secret police. In May 2002, two men were hanged in Pakistan after being convicted of Kamal&#x27;s murder.

== Legacy ==

A special issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 13 November 2006, included Meena among &quot;60 Asian Heroes&quot; and wrote: &quot;Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an Afghan women&#x27;s rights movement based on the power of knowledge.&quot;

RAWA says of her &quot;Meena gave 12 years of her short but brilliant life to struggle for her homeland and her people. She had a strong belief that despite the darkness of illiteracy, ignorance of fundamentalism, and corruption and decadence of sell outs imposed on our women under the name of freedom and equality, finally that half of population will be awaken and cross the path towards freedom, democracy and women&#x27;s rights. The enemy was rightly shivering with fear by the love and respect that Meena was creating within the hearts of our people. They knew that within the fire of her fights all the enemies of freedom, democracy and women would be turned to ashes.&quot;

An enduring quote from Meena states:

<doc id="1108868" wikidata="Q917862" url="?curid=1108868" title="First Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge">
<text>The First Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge is a bridge over the Mekong, connecting Nong Khai Province and the city of Nong Khai in Thailand with Vientiane Prefecture in Laos. The Lao capital city Vientiane is approximately from the bridge. 

The bridge is 1,170 meters (0.73 mi) long. It has two -wide road lanes, two -wide footpaths and a single gauge railway line in the middle, straddling the narrow central reservation.

* The rail gauge is 
* The loading gauge might be 
* The structure gauge (roughly equal to a road lane) might be about 

==History==

Opened on 8 April 1994, it was the first bridge across the lower Mekong, and the second on the full course of the Mekong.

The cost was about A$42 million, funded by the Government of Australia as development aid for Laos.

The bridge was designed and built by Australian companies as a demonstration of their ability to complete major infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia. The concept design of a balanced cantilever bridge was proposed by Bruce Ramsay of VSL with the final design carried out by Maunsell consulting engineers. It was built by John Holland.

The official name of the bridge was changed, with the addition of &quot;First&quot; after the opening of the Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge further south at Savannakhet in January 2007.

==Road traffic==

Traffic on the bridge drives on the left, as in Thailand. Traffic in Laos drives on the right. The changeover at the Lao end, just before the border post, is controlled by traffic lights.

A shuttle bus service operates across the bridge, between the Lao and Thai border posts.

Bicycles and tricycles can travel on either the road or the footpath, while pedestrians can walk directly on the footpath.

The bridge is part of AH12 of the Asian Highway Network.

==Railway==

A meter gauge rail track from Nong Khai station runs along the central reservation of the bridge. Road traffic is stopped when a train is crossing.

In March 2004, an agreement between the Thai and Lao governments was signed to extend the railway to Thanaleng Railway Station in Laos, about from the bridge. This was the first modern railway link to Laos, as a short portage line once existed. The Thai government agreed to finance the line through a combination of grant and loan. Construction began in January 2007. Test trains began running in July 2008. The formal inauguration occurred on 5 March 2009.

In February 2006, approval of funding for the rail line from Thanaleng Railway Station to Vientiane, was announced by the French Development Agency.

A US$50 million loan was reportedly received from the Thai government for the extension. Construction was originally slated to begin in December 2010. Lao railway officials confirmed as late as September 2010 that plans would go ahead. The extension, which would have taken an estimated three years to complete, would have stretched from Thanaleng to a new main Khamsavath Station. The station will be completed by June 2022, and open 2023.

Since February 2010, the Eastern and Oriental Express crosses the Mekong via the bridge into Laos. There is currently no connection to the China-Laos Railway. The standard gauge line circles the north east of Vientiane, to a depot just 2 km from the Friendship Bridge. A new bridge is proposed from this point, to join the proposed Thai High speed line at Nong Khai station just south of the Mekong.

<text>60 State Street is a modern skyscraper on historic State Street in the Government Center neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Completed in 1977, it is Boston&#x27;s 19th tallest building, standing 509 feet (155 m) tall, and housing 38 floors .

==History==

Sixty State Street marks the site of one of two colonial taverns named the Great Britain Coffee-House, where Queen Street (now Court Street) ended and King Street (now State Street) began. This Great Britain Coffee-House, established in 1713, advertised &quot;superfine bohea, and green tea, chocolate, coffee-powder, etc.&quot;

In 1838, Thatcher Magoun Sr., a ship designer, builder and merchant who ran a shipbuilding facility in Medford, established Thatcher Magoun &amp; Son, a counting-house, on the 60 State Street site to manage his business revenue, bookkeeping and correspondence. This helped to establish State Street as one of Boston&#x27;s financial centers, thus initiating the city&#x27;s Financial District. His son and grandson, Thatcher Magoun Jr. and Thatcher Magoun III, kept the firm going in the maritime trade until the late 1870s. An abstract from the firm&#x27;s records reads:

Upon Magoun Sr.&#x27;s death at 81 in 1856, the Thatcher Magoun, a clipper ship built by Hayden &amp; Cudworth in Medford for Thatcher Magoun &amp; Sons, was named and launched in his memory. Author Hall Gleason described the clipper as follows: &quot;Her figurehead was a life-like image of the father of ship building on the Mystic... She made five passages from Boston to S.F., the fastest being 113 days and the slowest 152 days; seven from N.Y. to S.F., fastest 117 and slowest 149; two from Liverpool in 150 and 115 days. The average of the fourteen is 128.7 days. S.F. to NY. in 96 days in 1869.&quot;

==Design and features==
===Architecture===
Designed by the Chicago-based firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and developed by Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes, 60 State Street is clad in pink granite to blend in with the red brick of Faneuil Hall, City Hall Plaza and other neighboring buildings and spaces. The granite-clad triangular pillars alternate with vertical banks of rectangular floor-to-ceiling windows in a pattern similar to that of Eero Saarinen&#x27;s black granite-faced CBS Building, a.k.a. &quot;Black Rock,&quot; in New York City.

Also like Black Rock, 60 State Street is surrounded by a pedestrian plaza; the plaza is raised rather than sunken and is accessible at street level from State Street and by two flights of stairs from Faneuil Hall Marketplace.

Unlike Black Rock&#x27;s rectangular solid composition, 60 State Street was given eleven sides and a two-part scheme so that it has the appearance of side-by-side octagonal tubes from a distance. The chamfered corner pillars are similarly octagonal. This theme recalls Boston&#x27;s historic architectural motif of chamfered bay windows on Beacon Hill and in the Back Bay.

===Venues and tenants===
The main office of a major international law firm, WilmerHale, is located at 60 State Street.

The building is shared with Good Measures and is the corporate headquarters for the company. The building also served as the corporate headquarters of the Sheraton Hotel group from 1978 until they were acquired by Starwood Hotels and Resorts in 1998.

The State Room is located in the building&#x27;s elegant space on the 33rd floor, the site of the former Bay Tower Room restaurant. The State Room run by Longwood Venues hosts private functions (such as weddings, corporate events) and offers panoramic views of Boston Harbor, the Financial District, Boston Common, the Massachusetts State House, the Charles River and the Mystic River. In 2009, the American Idol Preliminary round for Boston was held here.

A Bank of America branch is at street level, with ATMs located at the intersection of Congress Street and State Street, where Boston&#x27;s Financial District begins. Next to Bank of America, there is a Headhouse for Blue and Orange Line. 
Berkshire Bank announced 60 State Street as their new corporate headquarters in late 2017.

To the rear of 60 State facing Congress Street, adjacent to the Faneuil Hall building and statue of Samuel Adams sits a Samuel Adams Beer Tap room on the building&#x27;s ground level.

<text>Rak Records is a British record label, founded by record producer Mickie Most in 1969. Rak was home to artists such as Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Suzi Quatro, Mud, Kenny, Hot Chocolate, Smokie, Arrows, Span, Racey and Kim Wilde. Rak Records were distributed via a licensing deal with EMI Records, which bought the company and its master recordings from Most in 1983. Most kept the company name and his RAK Studios, which still exists in St. John&#x27;s Wood along with Rak Publishing. The latter company represents artists such as Joan Jett, Ben Taylor and KK. In 1986, Most defected the label from EMI to PRT Records which handled the last releases until February 1988. Owing to the records not being hits, the label folded. However, 26 years later in late 2014, Rak Records was revived as a label for new artists releasing both downloads and 7-inch vinyl in the form of a singles club. The Cadbury Sisters, Trojanhorse, and Beautiful Boy were the new signings. They recorded their own original songs as the A-sides, and covered a classic Rak artists cover as the B-side. The Cadbury Sisters covered Steve Harley&#x27;s 1975 classic &quot;Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)&quot; (even though it was originally released on the generic EMI label), Trojan Horse did Cozy Powell&#x27;s &quot;Dance With The Devil&quot;, and Beautiful Boy did &quot;Kids In America&quot;. As PRT Records no longer exists, the label is now distributed by Gearbox Records using the original sailing yacht paper label and the records packaged in the original royal blue paper sleeves.

When Warner Music Group acquired Parlophone from EMI in 2013, this included the rights to Hot Chocolate and other artists. However, Suzi Quatro&#x27;s albums on Rak are owned by currently independent label Chrysalis Records after Blue Raincoat Music acquired that label in May 2016 from Warner.

==Rak Publishing==
Rak Publishing is currently in London, in the original RAK Studios complex in St John&#x27;s Wood. They manage the publishing rights for songs like &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot; by Hot Chocolate, &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; by Arrows, covered by Joan Jett and Britney Spears, and &quot;Kids In America&quot; recorded by Kim Wilde. Rak Publishing and Tummy Touch Records are currently releasing new and archive material from the Rak catalogue.

<doc id="1108876" wikidata="Q5419578" url="?curid=1108876" title="Exchange Place (Boston)">
<text>Exchange Place is a modern skyscraper located at the block of 43–53 State Street or 1 Exchange Place, between Congress and Kilby Streets, in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1981–1985, it is tied for Boston&#x27;s 17th tallest building, standing 510 feet (155 m) tall, and containing 40 floors. The glass tower portion rises out of a previous building, the 12-story Boston Stock Exchange, built in 1889–1891 and designed by Peabody and Stearns. The intent was to demolish the older building in order to construct the skyscraper, but preservationists succeeded in rescuing a portion of the Stock Exchange&#x27;s facade.

Brookfield Office Properties, which had previously purchased the building from Harold Theran in 2006, sold Exchange Place to UBS Realty Investors LLC in 2011. It is home to the Boston Consulting Group, advertising agency Hill Holliday, marketing agency Optaros, software company Acquia, Hachette Book Group, the Macquarie Group, The Blackstone Group, and AllianceBernstein. In June 2017, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; moved into Exchange Place from its longtime headquarters on Morrissey Boulevard in Dorchester, Boston.

The original Exchange Building was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1980.

The building is inter-connected by Metro-Boston&#x27;s district heating system helping it also achieve LEED Platinum and Energy Star Certification for energy conservation.

An Amalgamated Bank branch is at street level, with ATMs located at the intersection of Congress Street and State Street.

== Accessibility and transportation ==

Close to the southwestern corner of the building near the junction of Congress Street with Exchange Place, the building sits directly atop the State Street MBTA station, featuring direct access to the Blue-Line Wonderland-bound platform and by extension the Orange Line.

=== Bus connections ===
At the main entrance on Congress Street a number of MBTA bus routes stop adjacent to the building and entrance to State street station. These include local routes to Charlestown, and North Station.

<doc id="1108881" wikidata="Q711639" url="?curid=1108881" title="Francis Richards (diplomat)">
<text>Sir Francis Neville Richards (born 1945) is a former British civil servant and diplomat who was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar from 2003 to 2006, and the director of the Government Communications Headquarters from 1998 to 2003.

==Career==

Richards is the son of Sir Brooks Richards, who served in Gibraltar with the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War, and was later the Cabinet Office&#x27;s Coordinator of Intelligence in the late 1970s. Francis Richards was educated at Eton and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and then commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets, serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus.

After Richards&#x27; army career was cut short by injury, he entered the Diplomatic Service, serving in New Delhi and Namibia and holding a number of senior posts at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He was the first High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Namibia.

He was director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham from 1998 to 2003. On his departure from GCHQ Richards said that the role was &quot;... the best job I have ever had or ever expect to have... but you need to keep things fresh.&quot; Richards would later criticise Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee, saying that it was &quot;not a very good idea&quot; for any former senior minister of the ruling party to chair the committee. Richards questioned whether Rifkind was therefore &quot;well-placed to command confidence&quot; when holding the agencies to account. Richards was the chairman of the trustees of Bletchley Park from 2006 to 2011 and the chairman of the Imperial War Museum from December 2011.

Richards served as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar from 2003 to 2006.

At the end of his term in Gibraltar on 17 July 2006, Richards handed-over the keys to the fortress of Gibraltar, in the traditional &#x27;Ceremony of the Keys&#x27;, and departed on HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot;. He was succeeded as governor in September 2006 by Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fulton, a former Commandant General Royal Marines.

An honorary senior fellow at the University of Birmingham, Richards was appointed director of its Centre for Studies in Security and Diplomacy in April 2007. He currently sits on the board of governors at Rendcomb College.

<text>Moot court is a co-curricular activity at many law schools. Participants take part in simulated court or arbitration proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in oral argument. In many countries, the phrase &quot;moot court&quot; may be shortened to simply &quot;moot&quot; or &quot;mooting&quot;. Participants are either referred to as &quot;mooters&quot; or, less conventionally, &quot;mooties&quot;.

==Format and structure==

Moot court involves simulated proceedings before an appellate court, arbitral tribunal, or international dispute resolution body. These are different from mock trials that involve simulated jury trials or bench trials. Moot court does not involve actual testimony by witnesses, cross-examination, or the presentation of evidence, but is focused solely on the application of the law to a common set of evidentiary assumptions, facts, and clarifications/corrections to which the competitors are introduced. Though not moots in the traditional sense, alternative dispute resolution competitions focusing on mediation and negotiation have also branded themselves as moot competitions in recent times, as had role-playing competitions in the past such as the Jean-Pictet.

Moot court, like law review and clinical work, is one of the key extracurricular activities in many law schools around the world. Depending on the competition, students may spend a semester researching and writing the written submissions or memorials, and another semester practicing their oral arguments, or may prepare both within the span of a few weeks. Whereas domestic moot court competitions tend to focus on municipal law such as criminal law or contract law, regional and international moot competitions tend to focus on cross-border subjects such as EU Law, public international law (including its subsets environmental law, space law, and aviation law), international human rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, international trade law, international maritime law, international commercial arbitration, and foreign direct investment arbitration. Ancillary issues pertaining to jurisdiction, standing, choice of law, and remedies are also occasionally engaged, especially in arbitration and international law moots.

In most moot court competitions, there are two sides and each side is represented by two speakers or oralists (though the entire team composition may be larger, and the number of speakers may range from one to four) and a third member, sometimes known as of counsel, may be seated with the speakers. Each speaker usually speaks between 10 and 25 minutes, covering one to three main issues. After the main submissions are completed, there will usually be a short round or two of rebuttal and even surrebuttal. Communications between speakers may or may not be prohibited. Throughout the course of the submissions, judges — usually lawyers, academics, or actual judges — may ask questions, though in some competitions questions are reserved to the end of submissions.

In larger competitions, teams have to participate in up to ten rounds (not including any domestic or regional qualifiers); the knockout/elimination stages are usually preceded by a number of preliminary rounds to determine seeding (power seeding is often used). Teams almost always must switch sides (applicant/appellant/claimant on one side, and respondent on the other) throughout a competition, and, depending on the format of the moot, the moot problem usually remains the same throughout. The scores of the written submissions are taken into consideration for most competitions to determine qualification (whether for the competition or for the knockouts) and seeding, and sometimes even up to a particular knockout stage. Participation in moot court are relevant to some law school rankings.

==International moot court competitions==
International moot competitions are generally targeted at students (including postgraduates) and only allow participants who have not qualified to practice law in any jurisdiction. However, there are a handful of international moot competitions that are targeted at newly qualified lawyers, such as the ECC-SAL Moot, which is a regional moot started in 2012 and is jointly organised by Essex Court Chambers and the Singapore Academy of Law, and the New South Wales Young Lawyers/CIArb competition.

The table below lists some of the more notable international moot competitions for students. Grand slam international moots refer to class-leading moots or those that attract a substantial number of teams, while smaller or less established and region-only competitions are known as internationals and regionals respectively. Some countries also divide competitions into various tiers of prestige for the purpose of awarding points in league tables, with moots such as the Jessup and Vis competitions being considered as belonging to the highest tier. Most international moots only permit one team per institution; competitions that allow more than one team tend to be smaller in scale, and competitions that allow teams to comprise members from more than one institution are rare. Some competitions also limit the number of teams based on geographical location; for instance, for most countries, the Jessup generally only permits one qualifying institution for every ten law schools.

For the 2019/20 international moots season, many competitions such as the Jessup, Frankfurt, and International Criminal Court were cancelled due to COVID-19. Some competitions, however, such as The European Law Moot Court Competition, Price, Vis, and Vis East, hosted the oral rounds via online platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. With international travel still largely restricted late into 2020, all major competitions adopted the virtual format for 2020/21 as well, with some modifying the rules regarding qualification procedures and methods of presentation (such as standing versus sitting, sharing devices, and speaking time). By the 2022/23 season, however, almost all competitions had reverted to the in-person format.

Some moot court organisations accept a small group of people for membership, and those members each participate in a number of national or regional moot court competitions. Other schools accept a larger number of members, and each member is matched with one competition. A few schools conduct moot court entirely intramurally. Moot court competitions are typically sponsored by organisations with interest in one particular area of law, and the moot court problems address an issue in that field. Competitions are often judged by legal practitioners with expertise in the particular area of law, or sometimes by sitting judges.

The basic structure of a moot court competition roughly parallels what would happen in actual appellate practice. Participants will typically receive a problem ahead of time, which includes the facts of the underlying case, and often an opinion from a lower court that is being challenged in the problem. Students must then research and prepare for that case as if they were lawyers or advocates for one or sometimes both of the parties. Depending on the competition, participants will be required to submit written briefs, participate in oral argument, or both. The case or problem is often one of current interest, sometimes mimicking an actual case, and sometimes fabricated to address difficult legal issues.

The annual inter-law school National Moot Court Competition, co-sponsored by the New York City Bar Association and the American College of Trial Lawyers, is among the oldest and most prestigious competitions in the United States. Other notable competitions include Harvard Law School&#x27;s Ames Moot Court Competition and Canada&#x27;s The Laskin Moot. A number of moot court competitions focus on specific areas of law. For example, the First Amendment Center annually holds a National First Amendment Moot Court Competition, in which the judges have included numerous United States Circuit Court judges.

While moot court is most commonly associated with law schools in North America, it is also a popular activity at the collegiate and high school levels. In the United States, the American Moot Court Association is the national governing body for undergraduate moot court. At the high school level, the National Association of Moot Court oversees a circuit of regional and national competitions each year.

===United Kingdom===
Notable competitions in the UK include the English Speaking Union Moot and London Universities Mooting Shield.

In England and Wales, moots typically simulate proceedings in either the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. Moot questions generally involve two questions of law that are under dispute and come with a set of facts about the case that have been decided at the first instance trial. Generally the question will surround a subject that is unclear under the present state of the law and for which no direct precedent exists. It is normal practice for the senior counsel to take on the first point and the junior the second; although this may vary depending upon the exact nature, and necessary length, of the arguments. Typically the question will focus on one area of law, such as tort, contract, criminal law or property law.

In Scotland a moot can be set in a variety of fora; in civil law problems it is set most commonly in either the Inner House of the Court of Session or in the House of Lords, although it is not uncommon for a moot to be heard in the Sheriff Court before the Sheriff or Sheriff Principal. Occasionally, an Employment Appeal Tribunal may also be used as a forum for a Scottish civil law moot. If the moot problem concerns Criminal Law, the moot will most likely be heard as though in the Appellate division of the High Court of Justiciary (commonly known as the Court of Criminal Appeal). Junior counsel is more likely to take the first moot point and senior counsel the second (this can however be reversed depending on the problem). The format of the moot is far more adversarial than that of English and Welsh moots. This manifests itself in different ways, most notably with the appellants and respondents facing each other during a moot, rather than, as in England and Wales, facing the judge.

<doc id="1108887" wikidata="Q310532" url="?curid=1108887" title="Miguel Najdorf">
<text>Miguel Najdorf ( ; born Mojsze Mendel Najdorf; 15 April 1910 – 4 July 1997) was a Polish-Argentine chess grandmaster. Originally from Poland, he was in Argentina when World War II began in 1939, and he stayed and settled there. He was a leading world player in the 1940s and 1950s, and is also known for the Najdorf Variation, one of the most popular chess openings.

==Early life in Poland==
Najdorf was tutored first by Dawid Przepiórka, then by Savielly Tartakower, the latter of whom he always referred to as &quot;my teacher&quot;.

At the beginning of his chess career, around 1930, Najdorf defeated a player believed to be named &quot;Glücksberg&quot; in a famous game often referred to as &quot;The Polish Immortal&quot;. In 1930, he tied for 6th–7th at the Warsaw Championship, an event won by Paulino Frydman. In 1931, he took second in Warsaw, behind Frydman. In 1932, he tied for 9th–10th in Warsaw. In 1933, he won in Warsaw (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;). In January 1934, he finished second to Rudolf Spielmann, in Warsaw. In summer 1934, he lost a match against Ored Karlin (+1–2=1). In 1934, he won the Warsaw championship. In 1935, he tied for 2nd–4th with Frydman and Henryk Friedman, behind Tartakower, in the 3rd Polish Chess Championship, held in Warsaw. Afterward, Najdorf won a match against Tartakower in Toruń (+2–1=2). In 1936, he tied for first with Lajos Steiner in the Hungarian Championship. In 1937, he took third at the 4th Championship of Poland in Jurata. In 1937, he won in Rogaška Slatina (Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn). In 1938, he tied for 10th–12th in Łódź. In 1939, he took sixth in Margate, and won in Warsaw.

Najdorf represented Poland in four pre-war Chess Olympiads. In August 1935, he played third board in the 6th Chess Olympiad in Warsaw (+9–2=6). In August 1936, he was second board in 3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad organised by the German Chess Federation in Munich (+14–2=4). In June/July 1937, he played at second board in the 7th Chess Olympiad in Stockholm (+5–3=7). In the 1939 Olympiad, Najdorf played second board for Poland and achieved a score of +12−2=4, winning a gold pen and pencil set.

==Move to Argentina==
During the 8th Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires in August/September 1939, World War II broke out. Najdorf was Jewish, as were two of his teammates, Tartakower and Frydman. He decided to stay and settle in Argentina (as did many others). He became an Argentine citizen in 1944.

His wife, daughter, parents and four siblings all were murdered in The Holocaust. Najdorf later remarried (twice) and had two daughters.

===Blindfold chess===

Najdorf set world records for simultaneous blindfold chess. He played a record 40 opponents in 1943, and increased the record to 45 in 1947. This record stood until 2011.

He set these records in the hope that the news would be reported in Europe and his family would learn of his whereabouts, but they had perished in concentration camps by the time the information arrived.

==Career in Argentina==
===1940s===
In September 1939, after the Olympiad, Najdorf emerged as one of the top players in the chess world. He tied for first with Paul Keres at Buenos Aires (Círculo de Ajedrez); the two scored 8½/11. In 1941, he took second, after Gideon Ståhlberg at Mar del Plata, with 12½/17. Later in 1941, he finished equal first with Ståhlberg at Buenos Aires, the two scoring 11/14. In 1942, he won at Mar del Plata, with 13½/17, ahead of Ståhlberg. In 1943, he was second at Mar del Plata, behind Stålhberg, scoring 10/13. In 1943, he won at Rosario. In 1944, he won at La Plata, with 13/16, ahead of Ståhlberg. In 1944, he tied for first with Hermann Pilnik at Mar del Plata, with each scoring 12/15. In 1945, he won at Buenos Aires (Roberto Grau Memorial), with 10/12, ahead of Ståhlberg and Carlos Guimard. He took second place at Viña del Mar 1945, with 10½/13, behind Guimard, then won Mar del Plata 1945 with 11/15, ahead of Ståhlberg, and repeated at Mar del Plata 1946 with 16/18, ahead of Guimard and Ståhlberg. He also won at Rio de Janeiro 1946.

After World War II ended, organized chess resumed in the international arena, particularly in war-stricken Europe. In 1946, Najdorf tied for 4th–5th with László Szabó at Groningen, with 11½/19; the event was won by Mikhail Botvinnik. He then won at Prague, with (+9−1=3), ahead of Petar Trifunović, Gösta Stoltz, Svetozar Gligorić, and Jan Foltys. He also won at Barcelona 1946, with 11½/13, ahead of Daniel Yanofsky. In 1947, he took second place at Buenos Aires/La Plata (Sextangular), with 6½/10, behind Ståhlberg, but ahead of Max Euwe. In 1947, he won at Mar del Plata. In 1947, he finished second, after Erich Eliskases, at São Paulo.

In 1948, Najdorf placed second at New York City with 6/9, two points behind Reuben Fine. He tied for 4th–5th with Héctor Rossetto at Mar del Plata, with 10/17, behind Eliskases, Ståhlberg, and Medina Garcia. Najdorf won at Mar del Plata 1948 with 14/17, ahead of Ståhlberg (13½), Eliskases (12), and Euwe (10½). He was second at Buenos Aires 1948, with 8/10, behind Ståhlberg. Najdorf won at Venice 1948, with 11½/13, ahead of Gedeon Barcza, Esteban Canal, and Euwe. In 1949, he tied for first with Ståhlberg at Buenos Aires. In 1950, he won at Amsterdam, with 15/19, ahead of Samuel Reshevsky (14), Ståhlberg (13½), Gligorić (12), Vasja Pirc (12), and Euwe (11½). He also won at Bled in 1950.

===World Championship contender===
Although not a full-time chess professional (for many years he worked in the insurance business, selling life insurance), Najdorf was one of the world&#x27;s leading chess players in the 1940s and 1950s.

Najdorf&#x27;s string of successes from 1939 to 1947 had raised him into the ranks of the world&#x27;s top players. According to Chessmetrics, he was ranked second in the world from mid 1947 to mid 1949. Based on his results, there was talk of inviting him to the 1948 World Championship tournament, but in the end he was not invited. He had won an ostensible qualifying tournament at Prague by a margin of 1½ points. There was a view in some quarters that Prague had been a rather weak tournament, so Najdorf&#x27;s accomplishment was downplayed. Najdorf stated in a 1947 interview:

Pressure from the Soviet Chess Federation, perhaps pushed by Botvinnik, may have been responsible for keeping Najdorf out.

In 1950, FIDE made him one of the inaugural International Grandmasters. In the same year he played at Budapest in the Candidates Tournament to select a challenger for the World Chess Championship 1951, and finished fifth. Three years later, in the 1953 Candidates Tournament, he finished equal sixth. He never succeeded in qualifying for the Candidates again. He did come close in the next cycle, narrowly failing to qualify from the 1955 Interzonal, held at Gothenburg, Sweden.

===Later career===
Najdorf won important tournaments such as Mar del Plata (1961) and Havana (1962). He also played in both Piatigorsky Cup tournaments, held in 1963 and 1966. Just before his 60th birthday, he participated in the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, achieving an even score against the former world champion Mikhail Tal.

Najdorf&#x27;s lively personality made him a great favorite among chess fans, as he displayed an aptitude for witty sayings, in the manner of his mentor Tartakower. An example: commenting on his opponent at the 1970 USSR vs. Rest of the World match, he remarked, &quot;When [then-World Champion Boris] Spassky offers you a piece, you might as well resign then and there. But when Tal offers you a piece, you would do well to keep playing, because then he might offer you another, and then another, and then ... who knows?&quot;

Najdorf remained active in chess to the end of his life. He won the South African Open in 1976 and at age 69, he tied for second place in a very strong field at Buenos Aires 1979, with 8/13, behind winner Bent Larsen (11/13), though ahead of former world champions Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky. At Buenos Aires 1988, he made a score of 8½/15 for fourth place at age 78. The next year in the 1989 Argentine Chess Championship, with several other GMs in the field, he tied for 4th–6th places, with 10/17. His last national championship was in 1991 at age 81, where he finished with a minus score. Najdorf was an exceptional blitz (five-minute) player, remaining a strong player into his 80s.

Najdorf regarded Capablanca and Fischer as the greatest players of all time.

===Olympiad performances===
Najdorf played eleven times for Argentina in Chess Olympiads from 1950 to 1976. He played first board in the 9th Chess Olympiad at Dubrovnik 1950 (+8–0=6), as well as at Helsinki 1952 (+11–2=3), Amsterdam 1954, Moscow 1956, Leipzig 1960, Varna 1962, Havana 1966, Lugano 1968, Siegen 1970, and Haifa 1976. Only during the Olympiad at Nice 1974, he played on third board.
Najdorf took eleven Olympic medals: seven for teams Poland and Argentina (four silver, three bronze), and four individuals (gold in 1939, 1950, and 1952, as well as one silver in 1962).

==Contributions==

The Najdorf Variation in the Sicilian Defense, one of the most popular openings in modern chess, is named after him. Najdorf also made contributions to the theory and praxis of other openings such as the King&#x27;s Indian Defense. Najdorf was also a well-respected chess journalist, who had a popular column in the &quot;Buenos Aires Clarín&quot; newspaper.

==Notable games==
* Glucksberg vs Miguel Najdorf, Warsaw 1929, Dutch Defence (A85), 0–1 &quot;The Polish Immortal&quot; or &quot;Najdorf&#x27;s Immortal&quot; – one of the most brilliant games of the twentieth century.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Gideon Stahlberg, Lodz 1938, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Semi-Tarrasch Defence (D40), 1–0 These two players settled in Argentina in 1939, where they had great battles in many events.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Paul Keres, Buenos Aires Circulo 1939, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Slav Defence (D11), 1–0 Keres opens the centre prematurely, and Najdorf forms a pawn roller and arranges a quick victory.
* Carlos Guimard vs Miguel Najdorf, Buenos Aires Circulo 1941, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Slav Defence (D11), 0–1 Najdorf shows how to play this line from the Black side, by comparison with the Keres game given above.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Mikhail Botvinnik, Groningen 1946, Nimzo–Indian Defence, Classical Variation (E35), 1–0 In their first meeting, Najdorf catches the future World Champion in a maze of tactics.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Isaac Boleslavsky, Groningen 1946, Old Indian Defence (A54), 1–0 Najdorf avoids a tactical battle with an early exchange of queens in Boleslavsky&#x27;s pet variation, then grinds him down.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Erich Eliskases, Mar del Plata 1947, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined, Orthodox Defence (D63), 1–0 Eliskases was another European GM who stayed in South America during World War II, and he also had a great rivalry with Najdorf.
* Miguel Najdorf vs Reuben Fine, New York 1951, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted (D28), 1–0 Fine was getting ready to retire from chess, with this being his last serious event at age 37.
* Mark Taimanov vs Miguel Najdorf, Zurich 1953, King&#x27;s Indian, Orthodox, Aronin–Taimanov, 9.Ne1 (E98), 0–1 A brilliancy-prize game from the 1953 Candidates event versus the Soviet grandmaster Mark Taimanov. Najdorf&#x27;s enthusiasm for, and virtuosity in conducting, the attack against the enemy king is well shown here, in a game praised by David Bronstein in his famous book on the tournament. It is also a good example of learning from one&#x27;s defeats. Earlier that year, Gligorić had beaten Najdorf with the same system. (Miguel Najdorf vs Svetozar Gligoric, Mar del Plata 1953). After the game, Don Miguel delivered his famous line: &quot;Taimanov had better go and play his piano!&quot;
* Miguel Najdorf once played a game of chess with communist revolutionary Che Guevara; they drew.

==Personal life==
According to a biography by his younger daughter Liliana (b. 1952), Mojsze Mendel (&quot;Mikel&quot;) Najdorf was the oldest of five children (four sons and one daughter) of Jewish parents, Gdalik (Gedali) and Raisa (Rojza) Najdorf (née Rojza Rosklein). When he was 14, he visited his school friend Ruben Fridelbaum&#x27;s house, and his violinist father taught him chess. Mikel was immediately hooked, read books about the game, and was soon able to give his teacher rook odds.

A musician friend introduced his fiancée Genia to Najdorf, but Najdorf and Genia fell in love, and Genia broke off her engagement and instead married Mikel. They had one daughter, Lusia. When Najdorf boarded the ship for the Buenos Aires Olympiad in 1939, Genia was ill with influenza, and chose not to accompany him. He arrived in Argentina on 21 August 1939. While the Olympiad was in progress, Najdorf&#x27;s country was invaded and World War II began. Despite his best efforts, he never saw his family again. His parents, wife and baby daughter, and all his known relatives and friends, were murdered in The Holocaust including his father. However, many years later, by chance he met a Polish immigrant in the New York City Subway, who turned out to be a cousin.

In 1944, Najdorf became a naturalized citizen of Argentina. He had studied Latin at college, so easily picked up Spanish. Najdorf spoke eight languages; in addition to his native Polish and adopted Spanish, he spoke English, Russian, Czech, Serbo-Croat, Dutch, and Yiddish.

In April 1947, Najdorf met Adela (&quot;Eta&quot;), one of the youngest of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac and Esther Jusid. They were married after only a few weeks of courtship. Adela was 11 years younger than Najdorf. They had two daughters, Mirta (b. 1948) and Liliana (b. 1952), and a miscarried son in between. Liliana was long resentful of the fact that her father was abroad when she was born, and did not see her until she was four months old. She describes her father as a mixture of extremes: violent-tempered, but compassionate and loving, selfish at times but also generous to a fault, jovial and a bon vivant, but also sad because of the terrible losses of the Holocaust.
Adela died on 21 August 1977, of an inoperable intestinal tumour. The family kept the diagnosis secret from her, while Najdorf consulted the best oncologists in the US to no avail.

Not long after Adela died, Najdorf married again, to Rita, who had been a widow for 12 years. Najdorf had met Rita and her husband Jacobo, a socialist attorney and keen chess player, soon after he arrived in Argentina. They became close family friends. Rita and Jacobo had no children of their own, but had many nieces and nephews, and they treated the Najdorf daughters like nieces. The families would often get together, and the men would play and analyse chess and the women would talk. At one such gathering, when Liliana was 13, she saw Jacobo die suddenly at a chessboard. The widowed Rita became an even closer friend to Adela. After Adela died, Rita and Najdorf became a couple, which Miguel&#x27;s daughters accepted without surprise and with relief.

Rita later developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and Najdorf became physically frailer. In 1996, Najdorf had a serious heart attack in Seville, which required a pacemaker insert. Upon returning to Argentina, he learned that Rita had been hospitalized with an intestinal blockage. He went to the hospital, and she recognized him despite her Alzheimer&#x27;s, and begged him to take her home, while he kissed her tenderly. Unexpectedly, she died the next day.

<text>The Benin Bronzes are a group of several thousand metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in what is now Edo State, Nigeria. The metal plaques were produced by the Guild of Benin Bronze Casters, now located in Igun Street, also known as Igun-Eronmwon Quarters. Collectively, the objects form the best examples of Benin art and were created from the fourteenth century by artists of the Edo people. The plaques, which in the Edo language are called &quot;Ama&quot;, depict scenes or represent themes in the history of the kingdom. Apart from the plaques, other sculptures in brass or bronze include portrait heads, jewellery, and smaller pieces.
Some of the dramatic sculptures date to the fourteenth century, but the bulk of the collection dates to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is believed that two &quot;Golden Ages&quot; in Benin metal workmanship occurred during the reigns of Esigie ( 1550) and of Eresoyen (1735–1750), when their workmanship achieved its highest quality.

Most of the plaques and other objects were taken by British forces during the Benin Expedition of 1897 as the British Empire&#x27;s control was being consolidated in Southern Nigeria. This expedition was positioned by British sources as retaliation for a massacre of an unarmed party of British envoys and a large number of their African bearers in January 1897. Some contemporary scholars, such as Dan Hicks, argue that the expedition was part of a broader series of premeditated attacks, framed as retaliatory or punitive, to further European imperialistic and economic interests in Africa. Following the expedition, two hundred pieces were taken to the British Museum in London, while the rest were taken to other European museums. A large number are held by the British Museum with other notable collections in Germany and the United States.

Late 19th-century scholars O. M. Dalton and Charles Hercules Read erroneously concluded that Benin knowledge of metallurgy came from the Portuguese traders, who were in contact with Benin in the early modern period. The Kingdom of Benin was a hub of African civilization long before Portuguese traders visited, and bronzes were made in Benin prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. The Benin bronze sculpture tradition is thought to have derived from or been influenced by that of the older nearby Kingdom of Ife in southwest Nigeria.

While the collection is known as the Benin Bronzes, like most West African &quot;bronzes&quot; the pieces are mostly made of brass of variable composition. There are also pieces made of mixtures of bronze and brass, of wood, of ceramic, and of ivory, among other materials. The metal pieces were made using lost-wax casting and are considered among the best African sculptures made using this technique. Benin began to trade ivory, pepper, and slaves with the Portuguese in the late 15th century and incorporated the use of manillas (brass ingots in the form of bracelets, bought from the Portuguese) as a metal source in their sculpture. The manillas&#x27; brass, previously suggested to come from The Netherlands, is now thought to come from the Rhineland region of Germany.

== History ==
=== Social context and creation ===
Many of the dramatic sculptures date to the thirteenth century, and a large part of the collection dates to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is believed that two &quot;Golden Ages&quot; in Benin metal workmanship occurred during the reigns of Esigie (fl. 1550) and of Eresoyen (1735–1750), when their workmanship achieved its highest quality.

The Kingdom of Benin, which occupied southern parts of present-day Nigeria between the fourteenth and nineteenth centuries, was rich in sculptures of diverse materials, such as iron, bronze, wood, ivory and terra cotta. The Oba&#x27;s palace in Benin City, the site of production for the royal ancestral altars, also was the site for an elaborate court ceremonial life in which the Oba of Benin, his warriors, chiefs and titleholders, priests, members of the palace societies and their constituent guilds, foreign merchants and mercenaries, and numerous retainers and attendants all took part. The palace, a vast sprawling agglomeration of buildings and courtyards, was the setting for hundreds of rectangular brass plaques whose relief images portray the persons and events that animated the court.

Bronze and ivory objects had a variety of functions in the ritual and courtly life of the Kingdom of Benin. They were used principally to decorate the royal palace, which contained many bronze works. They were hung on the pillars of the palace by nails punched through them. As a courtly art, their principal objective was to glorify the Oba, the divine king, and the history of his imperial power or to honour the Iyoba of Benin (the queen mother). Art in the Kingdom of Benin took many forms, of which bronze and brass reliefs and the heads of kings and queen mothers are the best known. Bronze receptacles, bells, ornaments, jewellery, and ritual objects also possessed aesthetic qualities and originality, demonstrating the skills of their makers, although they are often eclipsed by figurative works in bronze and ivory carvings.

In tropical Africa the technique of lost-wax casting was developed early, as the works from Benin show. When a king died, his successor would order that a bronze head be made of his predecessor. Approximately 170 of these sculptures exist, and the oldest date from the twelfth century. The Oba, or king, monopolized the materials that were most difficult to obtain, such as gold, elephant tusks, and bronze. These kings made possible the creation of the splendid Benin bronzes; thus, the royal courts contributed substantially to the development of sub-Saharan art. In 1939, heads very similar to those of the Kingdom of Benin were discovered in Ife, the holy city of the Yoruba, which dated to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This discovery supported an earlier tradition holding that it was artists from Ife who had taught Benin the techniques of bronze metalworking. Recognition of the antiquity of the technology in Benin advanced when these sculptures were dated definitively to that era.

=== European interest and the Benin Expedition of 1897 ===
Few examples of African art had been collected by Europeans prior to the nineteenth century, though European printed books already included images of Benin City and of the oba&#x27;s palace from the early 1600s onward. Only at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when colonization and missionary activity began, did larger numbers of African works begin to be taken to Europe, where they were described as simple curiosities of &quot;pagan&quot; cults. This attitude changed after the Benin Expedition of 1897.

In 1897, the vice consul general James Robert Phillips, of the Niger Coast Protectorate, together with six other British officials, two businessmen, translators, and 215 porters, set off toward Benin from the small port of Sapele, Nigeria, The true intention of the visit is disputed. The delegation&#x27;s stated aim was to negotiate with the Oba of Benin, while some historians contend that it was a reconnaissance mission disguised as a peaceful diplomatic delegation with the goal of ultimately overthrowing the king (Oba) of Benin. Although they had given word of their intended visit, they were later informed that their journey must be delayed, because no foreigner could enter the city while rituals were being conducted; however, the travellers ignored the warning and continued on their expedition. They were ambushed at the south of the city by Oba warriors, and only two Europeans survived the ensuing massacre.
News of the incident reached London eight days later and a naval punitive expedition was organized immediately, which was to be directed by Admiral Harry Rawson. British forces sacked and destroyed Benin City. Following the attack, the victors took the works of art decorating the Royal Palace and the residences of the nobility, which had been accumulated over many centuries. According to the official account of this event written by the British, the attack was warranted because the local people had ambushed a peaceful mission, and because the expedition liberated the population from a reign of terror. A 2020 book suggests that; &quot;since the 1960s, historians have increasingly understood the expedition to depose Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi (Overami) who had acceded to the throne in 1888, not as a retaliation, but to have been dictated by policy for a long time.&quot; Some consider that this creates an ambiguity surrounding the objects&#x27; ownership which has bearing on the possible modern return of the bronzes to Benin.

The works taken by the British were a treasure hoard of bronze and ivory sculptures, including king heads, queen mother heads, leopard figurines, bells, and a great number of images sculpted in high relief, all of which were executed with a mastery of lost-wax casting. In 1910, German researcher Leo Frobenius carried out an expedition to Africa with the aim of collecting works of African art for museums in his country. Today perhaps as few as fifty pieces remain in Nigeria although approximately 2,400 pieces are held in European and American collections.

=== Division among museums ===

The Benin Bronzes that were part of the booty of the punitive expedition of 1897 had different destinations: one portion ended up in the private collections of various British officials; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office sold a large number, which later ended up in various European museums, mainly in Germany, and in American museums. The high quality of the pieces was reflected in the high prices they fetched on the market. The Foreign Office gave a large quantity of bronze wall plaques to the British Museum; these plaques illustrated the history of the Benin Kingdom in the fifteenth and sixteenth century.

== Subsequent sales, restitutions and repatriations ==
The two largest collections of Benin Bronzes are located in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and in the British Museum in London, while the third largest collection is located in several museums in Nigeria (principally the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos).

Since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has sought the return of the bronzes on several occasions. There has also been extensive debate over the location of the bronzes being distant from their place of origin. Often, their return has been considered emblematic of the repatriation of the African continent. The artefacts have become a test case in the international debate over restitution, comparable to that of the Elgin Marbles, and help change attitudes towards repatriation.

The British Museum sold more than 30 Benin Bronzes to the Nigerian government between 1950 and 1972. In 1950, the museum&#x27;s curator Hermann Braunholtz declared that, although made individually, of the 203 plaques acquired by the Museum in 1898, 30 were duplicates; because they were identical representations, he determined that they were superfluous for the museum and were sold. The sales stopped in 1972 and the museum&#x27;s African art specialist said that they regretted the sales. A newspaper publication revealed that in 1953, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a Benin Bronze head for £5,500 when the previous record sale was £780. In 1968, Christies sold for £21,000 a Benin Head that was discovered by an officer around his neighbour&#x27;s greenhouse. In 1984, Sotheby&#x27;s auctioned a plaque depicting a musician; its value was estimated at between £25,000 and £35,000 in the auction catalogue. In 2015, a Benin Bronze head was sold to a private collector for a record fee of £10 million.

In 2018, an agreement was made between the Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) and the government in London to return Benin Bronzes that will be used to form a temporary exhibition at the New Benin Royal Museum in Edo State. The group comprises representatives of several international museums, the Royal Court of Benin, Edo State Government and the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. In 2015, Mark Walker returned some Benin Bronzes that were taken by his grandfather during the siege on Benin Kingdom, and he was received by Prince Edun Akenzua in Benin City.

The University of Aberdeen agreed in March 2021 to return a bronze head of an Oba, that had been purchased at an auction in 1957. The return was completed at a handover ceremony held on 28 October 2021.
In April 2021, the German government declared the restitution of &quot;looted&quot; Benin bronzes in Germany&#x27;s public collections by 2022. Hartmut Dorgerloh, the director of the Humboldt Forum, which incorporates the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, said at a press event that exhibiting the Benin bronzes in the new museum complex in Berlin as earlier planned is &quot;now not imaginable&quot;. Also in April 2021, the Church of England promised to return two Benin bronzes that were given as gifts to the then Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie almost 40 years ago. These bronzes were meant to join the collection of the future Benin Royal Museum. In the same month, the Horniman Museum in South London said it was considering legal advice in terms of repatriation and restitution of 49 works from Benin City including 15 brass plaques, weapons and jewellery in its possession.

In response to the British Museum&#x27;s continued refusal to return looted Benin bronzes, the &quot;Iyase&quot; (traditional prime minister) of Benin Kingdom unveiled the largest bronze plaque to date on 30 July 2021. The plaque contains over 2 tons of brass and was created by one of the grandsons of the current &quot;Iyase&quot; of Benin Kingdom, Lukas Osarobo Zeickner-Okoro. It is titled &#x27;The Return of Oba Ewuare&#x27; to symbolise the Benin belief in reincarnation and a restart of the Benin Bronze Age in the reign of the current Oba of Benin, Ewuare II. It therefore honours the Oba and was even offered in exchange for the bronzes held by the British Museum.

In October 2021, Jesus College, Cambridge, announced that it would be repatriating a sculpture of a cockerel, known as Okukor, to Nigeria, on the 27 October, after the student body brought to light its historical significance as a looted artefact. The statue had previously been removed from display in 2016, after student calls for the statue to be repatriated; following investigation by the college&#x27;s Legacy of Slavery Working Party (LSWP), it was ascertained that the statue had been directly taken from the court of Benin, and had been gifted to the college by the father of a student in 1905. In February 2022, two Benin bronzes, the bust of a Head of an Oba and the bronze cockerel Okukor, that had been returned by the University of Aberdeen and Jesus College, Cambridge, were received at the royal palace in Benin City by the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II. In December 2022, the University of Cambridge legally transferred ownership of more than 100 Benin artefacts from its Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology to the National Commission of Museums and Monuments (NCMM) of Nigeria. A museum spokesperson declared that some of the pieces were to remain in Cambridge “on extended loan” to ensure that “this west African civilisation continues to be represented in the museum&#x27;s displays, and in teaching for school groups.&quot;

In November 2021, the Metropolitan Museum of Art transferred two sixteenth-century Bronze plaques, a Warrior Chief and Junior Court Official to the National Commission for Museums and Monuments. This transfer is not to be confused as a response to repatriation requests, as the Institution owns a collection of about 160 Benin Bronzes. Instead, the museum describes this transfer as a return of plaques that were stolen from the National Museum in Lagos in the 1950s.

In January 2022, the Great North Museum: Hancock in Newcastle, England, agreed to return a Benin Bronze stave to Nigeria. In March 2022, the Smithsonian Institution announced that 39 bronzes would be repatriated. The bronzes are meant to be on display at the future National Museum of Benin City. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of African Art signed over ownership of 29 Benin bronzes to the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments in a formal ceremony on 11 October 2022, in Washington D.C., with Nigerian leaders and cultural officials in attendance; at the same time, the National Gallery of Art returned one Benin bronze. The US Supreme Court denied a petition to block the Smithsonian from returning the bronzes. The petition was filed by the Restitution Study Group, who argued the bronzes are linked to the descendants of enslaved people in America, because they were made with metal ignots traded for African slaves, and removing the bronzes would deny Americans the opportunity to experience their heritage.

On 1 July 2022, Germany announced the immediate ownership transfer of 1,100 artefacts held by the Linden Museum in Stuttgart, Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt Forum, the Cologne Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum, Hamburg&#x27;s Museum am Rothenbaum and the State Ethnographic Collections of Saxony to Nigeria. The physical return of each item will be negotiated between the German museums and the Nigerian government and some of the objects could remain in display in Germany under custody agreements. Hermann Parzinger, the head of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, an authority that oversees many of Berlin&#x27;s museums, said a “representative collection of objects” would remain in the German capital on a long-term loan.

On 28 November 2022, the Horniman Museum in London held an official ceremony, unconditionally transferring ownership of its Benin Bronzes back to Nigeria.

A few months later, on 23 March 2023, departing President Muhammadu Buhari declared by decree, that all restituted objects from the Benin Expedition belong to the Royal Family in Benin City. Effective for objects that have been restituted and those to be restituted in the future. The Royal Family alone should be responsible for safekeeping and management. The bronzes were thereby turned into private property, to the exclusion of every other person and institution. Oba Ewuare II announced his plans to put them into a future museum on, or near, his palace grounds. European journalists noted that the Museum of West African Art, for whose construction Germany had pledged 4 million Euros, would most likely remain empty. Swiss ethnologist Brigitta Hauser-Schäublin concluded that Germany&#x27;s 2022 restitution policy was a fiasco. According to journalists, the German government returned the Benin bronzes to Nigeria under certain conditions which were ignored by the Nigerian president.

February 19 2025, the Dutch government returned a group of 113 bronzes from the national collection and another 6 from the collection of the city of Rotterdam. According to Nigerian representatives this largest restitution to that date should become an example for other countries.

=== Opposition ===
In August 2022, an African-American slavery reparations activist group in the US, called the Restitution Study Group, petitioned against the United Kingdom&#x27;s Charity Commission repatriating the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The group argued that in the country&#x27;s history, African people had been complicit in selling captives into the Atlantic slave trade. Instead, the group suggested that descendants of enslaved Africans should have co-ownership over the Benin Bronzes in Western museums.
They also tried to prevent the repatriating of Benin Bronzes by the Smithsonian Institution in October 2024.

=== &quot;Digital Benin&quot; online platform ===
In November 2022, ARTnews magazine and other media reported that the &quot;Digital Benin&quot; online database had been created by a number of museums, including both experts from Nigeria (National Museum Lagos and Benin City National Museum) as well as from other African and Western institutions. &quot;Digital Benin&quot; lists 131 institutions from 20 countries with Benin cultural heritage in their collections. This new online platform allows visitors to learn about the specifications, location and provenance of more than 5,000 African artifacts, including maps, high-resolution images, and the title of the works in English and Edo languages.

== The works ==

The Benin Bronzes are more naturalistic than most African art of the period. The bronze surfaces are designed to highlight contrasts between light and metal. The features of many of the heads are exaggerated from natural proportions, with large ears, noses, and lips, which are shaped with great care. The most notable aspect of the works is the high level of metal working skill at lost-wax casting. The descendants of these artisans still revere Igue-Igha, as the person who introduced the art of casting to the Kingdom of Benin.

Another important aspect of the works is their exclusivity: property was reserved only for certain social classes, reflecting the strict hierarchical structure of society in the Kingdom of Benin. In general, only the king could own objects made of bronze and ivory, however, he could allow high-ranking individuals to use such items, such as hanging masks and cuffs made of bronze and ivory. Coral was also a royal material. Coral neck rings were a symbol of nobility and use was granted specifically by the Oba.

=== Themes ===

The rectangular plaques exist in two formats. In one, the long vertical sides are turned back, creating a small edge that is decorated with an incised guilloché pattern. In the other format, which is much narrower, the turned-back edges are missing and the design of the plaque background ends abruptly, as if cut off. These variations probably reflect the size and shape of the palace pillars and the arrangement of the plaques on them. The plaques are generally about thick.

The backgrounds on the front of most of the plaques are incised with foliate patterns bearing one to four leaves, which is referred to as &quot;ebe-ame&quot;, or the &quot;river leaf&quot; design. The leaves were used in healing rites by priestesses of Olokun, the god of the sea.

Some of the reliefs represent important battles of the sixteenth-century wars of expansion; however, the majority depict dignitaries wearing ceremonial dress. Most of the plaques portray static figures, either alone, in pairs, or in small groups arranged hierarchically around a central figure. Many of the figures depicted in the plaques may be identified only through their clothing and emblems, which indicated their rank and function in the court, but not their individual identities. Although there have been attempts to link some of the depictions with historical figures, these identifications have been speculative and unverified. In certain cases, the lack of information even extends to the functional roles of some figures, which cannot conclusively be determined.
The bronze heads were reserved for ancestral altars. They were also used as a base for engraved elephant tusks, which were placed in openings in the heads. The commemorative heads of the king or the queen mother were not individual portraits, although they show a stylized naturalism. Instead, they are archetypical depictions; the style of their design changed over the centuries, which also occurred with the insignia of the depicted royalty. The elephant tusks with decorative carvings, which may have begun being used as a decorative element in the eighteenth century, show distinct scenes from the reign of a deceased king.

As a prerequisite for royal succession, each new Oba had to install an altar in honor of his predecessor. According to popular belief, a person&#x27;s head was the receptacle of the supernatural guide for rational behavior. The head of an Oba was especially sacred, since the survival, security, and prosperity of all Edo citizens and their families, depended on his wisdom. In the annual festivals to reinforce the mystical power of the Oba, the king made ritual offerings in these sanctuaries, which were considered essential for the continuation of his reign. The stylistic variation of these bronze heads is such an important characteristic of Beninese art that it constitutes the primary scientific basis for establishing a chronology.

The leopard is a motif that occurs throughout many of the Benin Bronzes, because it is the animal which symbolizes the Oba. Another recurring motif is the royal triad: the Oba in the centre, flanked by two assistants, highlighting the support of those who the king trusted in order to govern.

According to some sources, the Benin artists may have been inspired by items brought during the arrival of the Portuguese, including European illuminated books, small ivory caskets with carved lids from India, and Indian miniature paintings. The quatrefoil &quot;river leaves&quot; might have originated from European or Islamic art, but by contrast, Babatunde Lawal cites examples of relief carving in southern Nigerian art to support his theory that the plaques are indigenous to Benin.

British archaeologist and anthropologist Dan Hicks discussed the looting of the Benin Bronzes and their current presence within museums around the world. In his book he expressed the view that the looting of the Benin Bronzes are not an &#x27;historical incident of reception&#x27; but an &#x27;enduring brutality&#x27;. It was also noted that a total figure of looted artefacts from Benin was up to 10,000 bronzes, ivories and other objects. Hicks notes that many of the looted Benin artefacts are in regional and university museums within the UK rather than the more well-known collections such as the British Museum, Royal Collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

=== Technique ===
Although the works generally are called the Benin Bronzes, they are made of different materials. Some are made of brass, which analysis has shown to be an alloy of copper, zinc and lead in various proportions. Others are non-metallic, made of wood, ceramic, ivory, leather or cloth.

The wooden objects are made in a complex process. It starts with a tree trunk or branch and is carved directly. The artist obtains the final form of the work from a block of wood. Since it was customary to use freshly cut wood in carvings, once the piece was finalized the surface was charred to prevent cracking during drying. This also allowed for polychromatic artworks, which were achieved using knife cuts and applications of natural pigments made with vegetable oil or palm oil. This type of grease, which was made near smoke from homes, allowed the wooden sculptures to acquire a patina that resembles rusty metal.

The figures depicted in the bronzes were cast in relief with details incised in the wax model. Artists working in bronze were organized into a type of guild under royal decree and lived in a special area of the palace under the direct control of the Oba. The works made using lost-wax casting required great specialisation. Their quality was superior when the king was especially powerful, allowing him to employ a great number of specialists.

Although the oldest examples of similar Benin metal work in bronze date from the twelfth century, according to tradition, the lost-wax casting technique was introduced to Benin by the son of the Oni, or sovereign of Ife. Their tradition holds that he taught the Benin metal workers the art of casting bronze using lost-wax techniques during the thirteenth century. These Benin artisans refined that technique until they were able to cast plaques only an eighth-of-an-inch (3 mm) thick, surpassing the art as practiced by Renaissance masters in Europe.

== Reception ==

One sixteenth-century bronze, depicting the Oba with Europeans, was featured in &quot;A History of the World in 100 Objects&quot;, a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 as a collaboration between the BBC and the British Museum; it was also published as a book.

<text>The Custom House Tower is a skyscraper in McKinley Square, in the Financial District neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The original building was constructed in 1837–47 and was designed by Ammi Burnham Young in the Greek Revival style. The tower was designed by Peabody and Stearns and was added in 1913–15. The building is part of the Custom House District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Standing at tall, the building is currently tied with The Hub on Causeway Tower as Boston&#x27;s 23rd-tallest buildings. It is part of the Custom House District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Since 1997, it has housed a Marriott timeshare hotel.

==Original building==
The site was purchased on September 13, 1837. Construction of a custom house was authorized by U.S. President Andrew Jackson. When it was completed in 1849, it cost about $1.076 million, in contemporary U.S. currency, including the site, foundations, etc.

Ammi Burnham Young entered an 1837 competition to design the Boston Custom House, and won with his neoclassical design. This building was a cruciform (cross-shaped) Greek Revival structure, combining a Greek Doric portico with a Roman dome, resembled a four-faced Greek temple topped with a dome. It had 36 fluted Doric columns, each carved from a single piece of granite from Quincy, Massachusetts; each weighed 42 tons (37 metric tons) and cost about $5,200. Only half these actually support the structure; the others are free-standing. They are and in diameter and high. Inside, the rotunda was capped with a skylight dome.

The entire structure sits on filled land and is supported by 3,000 wooden piles driven through fill to bedrock. Before land reclamation was done in the middle of the 19th century, Boston&#x27;s waterfront extended right to this building. Ships moored at Long Wharf almost touched the eastern face of the building. The Custom House was built at the end of the City docks, to facilitate inspection and registration of cargo. The federal government used the building to collect maritime duties in the age of Boston sailing ships.

This description of the original Custom House appears in the 1850 &quot;Boston Almanac&quot;:

Situated at the head of the dock between Long and Central Wharves, fronts east on the dock, west on India Street, and is in the form of a Greek Cross, [with] the opposite sides and ends being alike. It is long north and south, wide at the ends, and through the centre. It is built on about 3,000 piles, fully secured against decay; the construction throughout is fireproof and of the very best kind.

The exterior of the building is purely Grecian Doric, not a copy, but adapted to the exigencies and peculiarities of the structure, and consists of a portico [overhang] of 6 columns on each side, on a high flight of steps, and an order of engaged columns around the walls, 20 in number, on a high stylobate or basement; the order of engaged columns terminating with 4 andae [pilasters] at their intersection with the porticos. The columns are in diameter and high, the shaft being in one piece, each weighing 42 short tons/37 metric tons.

The cellar, which is high to the crown of the arches, is principally used for the storage of goods, which are conveyed to it through the basement story. The steam apparatus for warming the whole building (which it does effectively) is situated in the cellar, having easy access to the coal vaults under the sidewalk outside of the building.

The principal entrances to the basement story are at each end. They are for the receipt of goods for storage. Near the northwest corner, on the west side, is the entrance to the Night Inspectors&#x27; apartments, also to the private staircase leading to the Collector&#x27;s room and the attic. South of the west portico is the entrance to the heating apparatus room, and on the south end is the entrance to the Custom House Truckmen&#x27;s room. This story consists of rooms for the Night Inspectors, Custom House Truckmen, and Engineer of the Heating Apparatus, also three sets of Water Closets: the remainder is used for storage of goods, weigher&#x27;s tabs, etc.

The principal ingress to the entrance story is through the porticos, but it can be entered from the Collector&#x27;s private staircase, and from two other private staircases in the basement. This story contains apartments and offices for the Assistant Treasurer, the Weighers and Gaugers, the Measurers, Inspectors, Markers, Superintendent of Building, etc. In the centre is a large vestibule, from which two broad flights of steps lead to the principal story, landing in two smaller vestibules therein, lighted by skylights in the roof, and these vestibules communicate with all the apartments in this story. The several rooms are for the Collector, Assistant Collector, Naval Officer, Surveyor, Public Store Keeper, their Deputies and Clerks; and for the facilities of doing business this arrangement is not surpassed. The grand-cross shaped Rotunda, for the general business of the Collector&#x27;s department, in the centre of this story, is finished in the Grecian Corinthian order; it is in its greatest length, 59 feet wide, and in the skylight.

In one of the panels of the Rotunda is inserted a tablet of marble (Dedication Tablet 1847), containing the following inscription: Boston Custom House Building. Authorized by the 23d Congress, A.D. 1835. Andrew Jackson, President U.S.A.; Levi Woodbury, Sec&#x27;y of the Treasury.—Opened August 1, A.D. 1847, James K. Polk, President U.S.A.; Robert J. Walker Sec&#x27;y of the Treasury; Marcus Morton, Collector of the Port; Samuel S. Lewis, Robert G. Shaw, Commissioners; Ammi Burnham Young, Architect.

==Tower==
By 1905, increased shipping required the building&#x27;s expansion. In 1913–1915, the architecture firm Peabody and Stearns added the tower to the base. Although Boston at that time had a height restriction, the Custom House was federally owned and exempt from it. The custom house&#x27;s new tower made it the city&#x27;s tallest. In 1947, the Old John Hancock Building, just one foot shorter, joined it in the skies over Boston. In 1964, it was exceeded by the Prudential Tower.

The tower was completed in January 1915 after four and a half years of work. It cost about $1.8 million to build. The tower contains a rotunda made of Vermont white marble covered by a dome. Outside of the top floor is a balcony, which, at the time of the tower&#x27;s opening, was said to have views of Mount Wachusett, the Peterboro Hills, and the shores of Cape Ann. The dedication ceremony was attended by Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Andrew James Peters, Collector Edmund Billings, Governor David I. Walsh, Mayor James Michael Curley, Cardinal William Henry O&#x27;Connell, Bishop William Lawrence, and the building&#x27;s architect, Robert Swain Peabody. The tower was opened on January 23, 1915. The clock on the upper tower of the building is in diameter. It was started at noon on April 6, 1916. The clock cost $2,500. Its hands are made of gold leaf painted California redwood and weigh 101 and 141 pounds respectively. Because of an undersized motor, the clock failed to work properly through much of the 20th century. In 1960, the Great Seal of the United States was painted in the lobby&#x27;s dome.
==Current use==

When custom officials moved into the Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill building in 1986, the Custom House was declared &quot;surplus property&quot;. On April 16, 1987, the city of Boston purchased the building from the General Services Administration, and the building remained unoccupied and inaccessible for 14 years.

The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Landmarks Commission, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Beal Companies, and Jung Brannen Associates, Inc. all proposed concepts for the use of the building that ranged from museums to offices to residential developments. In 1995, the Beal Companies and Marriott Ownership Resorts International announced plans to develop the building into a timeshare resort, and retained Jung Brannen Associates as architects. In 1997, work began to convert the building into an 87-room Marriott Vacation Club.

One of the obstacles in converting the structure was the small amount of usable space on each floor of the tower, a problem that several earlier redevelopment plans faced and failed to overcome. The Jung Brannen team created ways to construct four to five suites per floor, using custom-designed built-in cabinetry and furnishings, to maximize the size and number of suites that could fit in the building. The end result was 87 one-bedroom suites with 22 different floor plans. Amenities included a private lounge, exercise area and game room and a refurbished observation deck on the tower&#x27;s 26th floor. A rotunda-level maritime museum and exhibit room are among the public spaces that occupy the newly refurbished ground floor. Marriott&#x27;s Custom House opened in August 1997 as a timeshare hotel property. More recently, it was renamed Marriott Vacation Club Pulse at Custom House, Boston.

Landscape designers Pressley Associates, Inc. redesigned the front plaza in 1999, and remarked:

It provides a new urban linkage space that provides a sense of cohesion between Custom House Tower and Faneuil Hall and Marketplace Center. As part of the current rehabilitation of the Tower to hotel use, the mandate of the landscape architectural design was to unify and revitalize the urban environment while respecting the buildings&#x27; historical importance. A plaza has been designed to encourage pedestrian access and use, and to relate contextually to the adjacent Faneuil Hall Markets and Marketplace Center through the extensive use of large caliper shade trees, brick and granite pavements, and high quality site furnishings. The scope of work provided includes site design, construction documents, approvals process, presentations, resident engineering and construction support services.

The top of the tower is now accessible to the public during limited hours for a small fee. A fenced-in area surrounds the top floor and allows visitors to view the city on all sides of the tower.

<text>Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer (LZO) is a lossless data compression algorithm that is focused on decompression speed.

== Design ==
The original &quot;lzop&quot; implementation, released in 1996, was developed by Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer, based on earlier algorithms by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv. The LZO library implements a number of algorithms with the following characteristics:
* Higher compression speed compared to DEFLATE compression
* Very fast decompression
* Requires an additional buffer during compression (of size 8 kB or 64 kB, depending on compression level)
* Requires no additional memory for decompression other than the source and destination buffers
* Allows the user to adjust the balance between compression ratio and compression speed, without affecting the speed of decompression

LZO supports overlapping compression and in-place decompression. As a block compression algorithm, it compresses and decompresses blocks of data. Block size must be the same for compression and decompression. LZO compresses a block of data into &quot;matches&quot; (a sliding dictionary) and &quot;runs&quot; of non-matching literals to produce good results on highly redundant data and deals acceptably with non-compressible data, only expanding incompressible data by a maximum of 1/64 of the original size when measured over a block size of at least 1 kB.

== Implementations ==
The reference implementation is written in ANSI C, and it has been made available as free software under the GNU General Public License. The copyright for the code is owned by Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer. It was originally published in 1996. Oberhumer has also written a command-line frontend called lzop.

Versions of LZO are available for the Perl, Python and Java languages. Various LZO implementations are reported to work under AIX, Atari TOS (Atari ST), ConvexOS, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS, Nintendo 64, Palm OS, PlayStation, Solaris, SunOS, VxWorks, Wii, and Win32.

FFmpeg&#x27;s libavutil library includes its own implementation of LZO as a possible method for lossless video compression. FFmpeg&#x27;s implementation of the decompressor is also used in OpenConnect in order to support LZO-compressed ESP packets sent by Juniper Networks and Pulse Secure VPN servers.

The Linux kernel uses its LZO implementation in some of its features:

*btrfs uses LZO as a possible compression method for file system compression.
*initrd and initramfs use LZO as a possible compression method for initial RAM drive compression.
*SquashFS uses LZO as a possible compression method for file system compression.
*zram uses LZO with run-length encoding called codice_1 as the default compression method for RAM drive compression.
*zswap uses LZO as the default compression method for virtual memory compression

<text>The caridoid escape reaction, also known as lobstering or tail-flipping, is an innate escape behavior in marine and freshwater eucarid crustaceans such as lobsters, krill, shrimp and crayfish.

The reaction, most extensively researched in crayfish, allows crustaceans to escape predators through rapid abdominal flexions that produce powerful thrusts that make the crustacean quickly swim backwards through the water and away from danger. The type of response depends on the part of the crustacean stimulated, but this behavior is complex and is regulated both spatially and temporally through the interactions of several neurons.

==Discovery of the first command neuron-mediated behavior==

In 1946, C. A. G. Wiersma first described the tail-flip escape in the crayfish &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot; and noted that the giant interneurons present in the tail were responsible for the reaction. The aforementioned neuronal fibres consist of a pair of lateral giant interneurons and a pair of medial giant interneurons, and Wiersma found that stimulating just one lateral giant interneuron (LG or LGI) or one medial giant interneuron (MG or MGI) would result in the execution of a tail flip. Wiersma and K. Ikeda then proposed the term &quot;command neuron&quot; in their 1964 publication, and applied it to the giant interneuron&#x27;s ability to command the expression of the escape response. This was the first description of a command neuron-mediated behavior and it indicated that the depolarization of a neuron could precipitate complex innate behaviors in some organisms.

This concept was further fleshed out with more specific and stringent conditions in 1972 when Kupfermann and Weiss published &quot;The Command Neuron Concept&quot;. The paper stated that command neurons were neurons (or small sets of neurons) carrying the entire command signal for a natural behavioral response. According to the authors, command neurons were both necessary and sufficient in the production of a behavioral response. The concept of command neuron-mediated behaviors was both ground breaking and controversial, since determining command neuron-mediated behaviors was a problematic process due to difficulties in understanding and interpreting anatomical and behavioral data.

==Research with crayfish==
Behavioral neurobiologists in the field of neuroethology have researched this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species &quot;Procambarus clarkii&quot;. Based on studies of &quot;P. clarkii&quot; it was discovered that the tail-flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits all unnecessary behaviors while generating a fixed action pattern for escape swimming. The type of escape response depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant tactile stimulus is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide tail fan region of the telson are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using powerful abdominal flexions. The entire process occurs in a fraction of a second as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds). Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments. The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success.

===Anatomy involved===
Like other decapod crustaceans, the crayfish possesses a hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior portion of the crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic groove, which separates the head and thorax region, is characterized by the presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish&#x27;s primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are flexibly interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a tail fan, a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the telson. The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming.

The anterior five segments of the crayfish house the massive flexor and extensor muscles. Six abdominal ganglia run down the entire length of the abdomen and communicate with one another through projections. The first five abdominal segments each have their own ganglion, that contains three roots with outward projections. The first has mixed sensory and motor nerves innervating swimmerets while the second has sensory and motor neurons that innervate the extensor muscles, while the third root contains only motor neuron projections that extend into the flexor muscles. The last segment contains the fusion of two ganglia. The ganglia here also receive sensory input from the sensitive hairs on the tail fan.

Each ganglion contains the body of one motor giant neuron (MoG), powerful and large bodied motor neurons whose projections innervate the five fast flexor (FF) muscles found in a segment and interact with them through chemical synapses. The ganglia also contain two sets of giant axons known as the lateral giant neurons and the medial giant neurons. These interneurons play important roles in escape swimming. Their large diameter allows for rapid conduction since there is less current leakage. Their projections extend through the third root in each ganglion, and Furshpan and Potter found that the synapses they subsequently made with the MoG passed depolarizing currents in a direct and unidirectional manner. These electrical synapses account for the speed of the escape mechanism and display some features of chemical synapses such as LTP and LTD. Variations in escape response characteristic depend on the location where the crayfish body is prodded or attacked and also depend on which of the giant neurons is stimulated.

===Response variants and their circuitry===

====Medial giant-mediated escape====
The medial giants innervate the entire ventral nerve cord. Their cell bodies and dendrites begin in the brain and collect sensory information presented by visual and tactile stimuli. These fibers terminate in the last abdominal segment. The response is triggered by abrupt tactile stimuli to the head or alarming visual stimuli. This results in the firing of all motor giant (MoG) neurons and the flexion of all the phasic fast flexor (FF) muscles in the abdomen, which rapidly curls the tail fan and last three segments underneath the crayfish. This produces a thrust that directs water towards the offending stimulus while propelling the crayfish directly backward. This behavior is then followed by the extension of the tail, which prepares it for swimming or the execution of another tail-flip. The extension and swimming phases will be discussed in the next escape variant.

Unfortunately, this variant of the tail-flip escape has not been extensively studied. Further studies should focus on this escape variant, paying special attention to exactly how visual information is processed and then converted into neuronal signals that produce a tail flip response.

====Non-giant escape====
Less abrupt or gradually intensifying stimuli evoke locomotion behavior similar to that seen in giant interneuron-mediated behaviors. However, the movements are less stereotyped and do not appear to occur in an all or nothing manner. They are so named because they lack the involvement of the giant interneurons, most likely because they do not produce depolarizations in the sensory neurons that are above the thresholds required to initiate these behaviors. Instead they involve one or a few of the smaller neurons innervating the tail. The latency periods for these escape mechanisms are longer, ranging from 80 to 500 ms. However, this slower swimming behavior allows for flexibility, since the crayfish can use visual stimuli and steer itself in a selected direction.

Non-giant escape often occurs during situations where lateral or medial giant-mediated escape may not be beneficial or during times where those behaviors are suppressed. This allows the crayfish to attack offenders, escape during feeding, or wriggle free when it has been restrained by the carapace.

Non-giant escape circuitry was found to be activated more during frontal attacks, but was rarely involved in the initial escape during a rear attack. Non-giant escape is often used after an initial giant interneuron-mediated tail flip. Compared to MG escape, the potentials produced in the MoG neurons by non-giant circuitry have lower amplitudes and longer durations while the recordings in the FF muscles are more erratic and have smaller amplitudes since they receive smaller EPSPs from the MoGs. So while it is hard to observe differences in MG and non-escapes, this property can be used to distinguish the two.

====Lateral giant-mediated escape====
The lateral giant (LG)-mediated escape mechanism is the most extensively analyzed form of the tail flip. The LG is not actually one neuron, but rather a group of closely associated neurons arranged end to end and connected by electrical synapses (also called septate synapses). As a result, the LGI functions as one giant, continuous neuron, such as the MG. The LGI&#x27;s large diameter and the efficiency and speed of electrical synapses, make the LGI-mediated escape especially rapid and effective. The LGI only innervates the first three rostral segments of the tail and is activated within 10 ms from when a mechanical stimulus is presented to the abdomen. When flexion occurs, only the first three segments flex and the tail fan is not directed under the body and forward but rather straight down. The unflexed segments increase the length of the paddle. The result is the rear end of the animal is directed upward and forward causing the animal to tumble or somersault forward. The tail is then rapidly extended, and this is usually followed by directed swimming.

The LGI is one of the few examples of a true command neuron. It passes the necessity and sufficiency principle put forward by Kupfermann and Weiss. Wiersma&#x27;s initial experiments showed that direct stimulation of the LGI was a sufficient release for the tail flip. In 1981, it was Olson and Krasne who showed that the LGI fulfilled the condition of necessity, because when spikes were inhibited in the LGI through introducing a hyperpolarizing current, no motor activity was produced in response to a stimulus that would have originally elicited the tail flip.

The LGI contains the following three phases, occurring over the span of about 100 ms:

=====1 – Flexion production=====
The LGI receives its sensory input from the hair-like projections found on the edge of the tail fan. The sensory information is sent from bipolar receptors connected to the hair that are directionally sensitive. The path of the signal varies from here depending on the strength of the input. In the beta pathway, the signal can then pass a chemical synapse, the information is sent to a sensory interneuron (SI) of either type A (which fires phasically in response to input) or type C, (which fire tonically). From there, the signal is sent across an electrical synapse to the LGI. The LGI can also receive the sensory input directly through an electrical synapse by way of the alpha pathway. This bypasses the SIs. The LGI can pass the signal to the MoG&#x27;s by two paths one of which passes the signal to the Motor Giant through direct electrical synapses. The MoG then passes the signal to the FF muscles. It can also use a second route across a fast electrical synapse to a premotor interneuron called the segmental giant (SG), two of which are located in each segment. The SGs then relays the signal to fast flexor motor neurons. The end result is a powerful and rapid flexion.

The convergence many inputs on the LGI and divergence of few signals show how the LGI functions as a decision making coincidence detector. It takes the information from both the alpha and the beta pathways and if the timing of the spikes is synchronous, the behavior is produced. If the timing is asynchronous, the later input is blocked by reducing the driving force of the signal and increasing the threshold voltage. The early synapse also causes current to leak through the active synapse, resulting in weak EPSPs that are ultimately unable to generate the tail flip.

A number of processes are inhibited once the initial flexion has begun. Further LGI spiking, influx of sensory information from the tail, MoG spiking and FF contraction are all inhibited so that a flexion and extension cycle can be completed before another flexion begins. Long IPSPs are generated to prevent these events. The extensor muscles are inhibited to prevent competition between the extensor and flexors. Rapid IPSPs presented at the muscle receptor organ (MRO) prevent the stretch receptor from initiating extension while they are also presented at the fast extensor motor neurons and the fast extensor muscles. The circuits responsible for slow flexion and extension are also inhibited.

=====2 – Re-extension=====
When the LGI-mediated inhibition subsides, the re-extension process begins. This process is mediated by the MRO and tail fan hair receptors, which were inhibited during the flexion portion of the escape behavior. The MRO is responsible for the initiation of extension and the inhibition of flexion through a reflex like mechanism. The muscle fibers of the MRO are located on the dorsal side of the abdomen, each spanning the joint of two segments. They are innervated by proprioreceptors that detect the stretch in extensor muscles when the flexors are contracted. They then fire phasically or tonically. It then excites the motor neurons in the fast extensor muscles while directly exciting an inhibitory neuron that prevents contractions in the FF muscles. The hair cells detect the resulting movement caused by the tail flip when activated, they would fire and excite the fast extensor motor neurons.

=====3 – Swimming=====
Non-giant-mediated responses are initiated after the tail flip, creating cycles of flexion followed by extension. This non-giant system is activated parallel to the LGI circuit when the hair cells receive input. However, this behavior has a longer delay that allows the onset of swimming to occur after the completion of the tail flip. The non-giant swimming occurs independently of the LGI response since direct stimulation of the LGI with the electrodes results in a tail flip but not the subsequent non-giant swimming. This swimming response seems to be a fixed action pattern mediated by a central pattern generator since it does not require sensory feedback for physical and temporal maintenance.

===Modulation and plasticity of the response===
The production of a tail flip is not always beneficial. Evolution has allowed the crayfish to be more flexible by presenting several control systems that will prevent the tail flip in situations where it will most likely be unnecessary or ineffective.

====Eating====
Crayfish often find themselves in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.

====Carapace restraint====
When a crayfish is held by its carapace either in the water or in the air, it does not respond with a tail flip when it receives sensory stimuli that would normally elicit the response. This inhibitory behavior does not seem to be mediated by the abdomen. When the thorax-abdomen junction is severed, the inhibitory effect is lost and the LGI in severed abdomen generates strong spikes since its threshold had decreased substantially. This is an indication that the behavior is mediated in the brain or the thorax of the crayfish. Most non-giant and MGI tail flips are also suppressed by restraint, so only a few non-giant systems are active to allow the crayfish to carefully wriggle free. The setup of this system seems to be designed to prevent the unnecessary use of all or nothing tail flips or ineffective tail flips when the situation requires more careful maneuvering.

The tail flip normally induces inhibition in an absolute fashion, such that it takes precedence over all the other tasks the segments are performing. However, during these situations, the effectiveness of the tail flip is reduced, so the inhibitory processes need to occur in a relative manner and a tail flip should occur only if absolutely necessary. During absolute inhibition is directed by more proximal synapses controlling the spike-initiating zones of the LGI. 
It is most likely that during restraint or feeding, the inhibitory process is mediated by inhibitory synaptic input on distal dendrites of the LGI . As a result, these signals would have to compete with other inputs for the control of the LGI.

====Learning====
Repeated tapping of the abdomen leads to habituation of the tail flip mechanism. However, self–habituation is prevented by command neuron–derived inhibition because when a tail flip is begun, the mechanisms that induce habituation are repressed. The habituation occurs at the level of the A type and C type interneurons, which experience synaptic depression. The habituation process is also mediated further up the circuit through the buildup of tonic inhibition, brought on by the repeated stimulation.

====Social status====
The feedback from social situations affect a crayfish&#x27;s ability to perform a tail flip. Serotonin levels are affected by social status. High levels are associated with aggressive behavior and a reduction in the frequency of tail flips performed. This is because the excitability of the LGI is decreased. Aggressive dominant males have a moderate reduction in tail flips while the subordinates have a much lower occurrence of tail flips. This presents a paradox since this means that subordinates are more likely to get killed. However, it was found that subordinates are more likely to use non-giant-mediated escape, indicating that the reduction in tail flips and enhancement of non giant escape is adaptive.

Changes in social status should correlate with changes in serotonin levels, resulting in changes in the escape strategies used by the crayfish. However this is only true when submissive crayfish become dominant, and not the reverse. The neuromodulatory processes of facilitation and inhibition seem to be mediated by different cell receptors. Differences in the effects of serotonin on the behavior of the crayfish seem to be the result of differences in the populations of these receptors. It is unknown how these modulation processes convey the information to the LG, and how the behavioral changes are precipitated.

===Evolution of the tail flip escape mechanism===
It has been hypothesized that the tail flip is derived from an ancient limb protraction driven (as opposed to tail flexion-driven) mechanism. This is because the SGs appear to be modified limb motor neurons whose peripheral axons affect the legs and swimmerets, but end blindly without any known function. It is known that another effect of Giant Fiber excitation is limb promotion which suggests that the premotor limb interneurons may be ancestors of the Giant Fibers.

It has been speculated that the ancestral escape mechanism was most likely a backwards jump due to the simultaneous protraction of the legs driven by the ancestors of the Giant Fibers. This behavior was probably similar to the escape system found in a mantis shrimp called &quot;Squilla&quot; that diverged from the crayfish lineage very early on. It is likely that this mechanism was replaced by the tail flip since the wide surface area of the tail made this behavior more selectively advantageous. This most likely occurred when the ancestral flexor motor neurons in each segment formed connections with one of these limb motor neurons. The &quot;Squilla&quot; mechanism seems to be similar to this ancestral state because a large diameter axon in the dorsal nerve chord facilitates limb promoter motor neurons. This seems to match the ancestral condition, but it is not known for sure whether the circuitry is homologous.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Caridoid&quot; is derived from the Greek or (pronounced &quot;kah-RISS&quot;), &quot;shrimp&quot; or &quot;prawn&quot;, which is the root of the name of the taxonomic infraorder &quot;Caridea&quot;, a large group of crustaceans also known as the &quot;caridean shrimp&quot;.

<text>The Billie Jean King Cup (or the BJK Cup) is the premier international team competition in women&#x27;s tennis, launched as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The name was changed to the Fed Cup in 1995, and changed again in September 2020 in honor of former World No. 1 Billie Jean King. The Billie Jean King Cup is the world&#x27;s largest annual women&#x27;s international team sports competition in terms of the number of nations that compete. The current chair is Katrina Adams.

The men&#x27;s equivalent of the Billie Jean King Cup is the Davis Cup, and the Czech Republic, Australia, Russia, Italy and the United States are the only countries to have won both Cups in the same year.

== History ==
In 1919, Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman had an idea for a women&#x27;s team tennis competition. This was not adopted but she persisted, presenting a trophy at the 1923 annual contest between the United States and Great Britain, named the Wightman Cup.

Nell Hopman, wife of the legendary Australian Davis Cup Captain Harry Hopman, later took up Mrs Wightman&#x27;s original idea. In 1962, a British resident of the United States, Mary Hardwick Hare, presented a dossier proving that support for such an event was overwhelming, persuading the ITF that it was a &#x27;good idea&#x27; to have a team championship played over one week in a different venue each year. 40 years after Wightman&#x27;s idea of a women&#x27;s Davis Cup, it became a reality. In 1963, the ITF launched the Federation Cup to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Open to all nations the competition became a resounding success.

The inaugural event attracted 16 countries. The competition was supported by the top players right from the start. Held at the Queen&#x27;s Club, in London, the first contest was between Australia and the United States. Grand Slam champions Darlene Hard, Billie Jean King, Margaret Smith and Lesley Turner all proudly representing their country on court. The United States would emerge the champion nation in the opening year. However, it was to be Australia in the early years, winning seven of the next eleven championships. Around 1980 the United States was able to establish some significant mark on the competition setting in future years a very high standard for others to compete against.

The first Federation Cup had attracted 16 entry teams, despite no prize money and teams having to meet their own expenses. When sponsorship became available, the number of teams expanded dramatically, first by the Colgate Group in 1976, and, from 1981 to 1994 by the Japanese communications and computer giant NEC. In 1994, there were 73 nations competing, with the host nation of a Federation Cup week was now being required to build a special tennis complex, giving rise to what became known as the Federation Cup &quot;legacy.&quot; The additional costs of each event could be offset with the host nations viewing their involvement as providing an opportunity to boost their national game.

For the 1992, a regional group qualifying format was introduced. In 1995, the event&#x27;s name was shortened to the Fed Cup, and a new home-and-away format was adopted as per the Davis Cup, so that women could play for their country in their own country. There have been a number of smaller changes to the format since 1995. The format change implemented in 2005 incorporates an eight Nation World Group I and eight nation World Group II both playing home-and-away over three weekends throughout the year. Three regional groups compete and there are promotions and relegations based on results.

The 2021 edition is set to have US$12 million in prize money.

== Format ==

=== Competition ===
While many nations enter the BJK Cup each year, only 16 countries qualify for the elite World Group and World Group II each year (eight in World Group and eight in World Group II).

They reach World Group and World Group II as follows:

*(a) World Group – the four nations that win their World Group first round tie remain in the World Group for the following year. First round losers contest the World Group play-offs against the four winning nations from World Group II to determine relegation/promotion for the following year&#x27;s competition. (The four nations that win World Group play-offs will be in the World Group the following year, while the four losers will start the following year in World Group II.)
*(b) World Group II – the four nations that win their World Group II ties will compete in the World Group I Play-Offs to determine relegation/promotion for the following year, as described above. Similarly the four nations that lose their World Group II ties will face winning nations from Group I Zonal competitions, in the World Group II play-offs, to determine relegation/promotion. (The four nations that win their World Group II play-offs will be in World Group II the following year, while the four losers will begin the next year in Group I Zonal events.)

Once in the World Group or World Group II, four nations will be seeded in each. The decision as to which nations will be seeded is made by the BJK Cup Committee, according to the ITF BJK Cup Nations Ranking.

At the levels below the World Group and World Group II, the BJK Cup nations compete in Zonal Competition events, which are split into three zones: The Americas Zone, the Asia/Oceania Zone and the Europe/Africa Zone. In each zone there are two groups, Group I being the higher and Group II the lower, except for the Europe/Africa Zone, which also has a Group III.

Within the Group zonal regions, teams are split into pools and play against each other in a round robin format. The exact format of each Group event, and promotion and relegation between them, varies according to the number of participating teams. Two teams are always promoted from Europe/Africa Group I to that year&#x27;s World Group II Play-Offs, while one team each go to the World Group II Play-Offs from Americas Group I and Asia/Oceania Zone Group I.

===Current structure===
This structure has been implemented since 2016.
===Ties===
In World Group and World Group II, and World Group and World Group II Play-off ties, each tie is contested in a best of five matches format, and is played across two days. On the first day there are two singles matches, and then the reverse singles matches take place on the following day. The final match is a doubles.

In Zonal Groups I, II and III, ties are played over the best of three matches (two singles and a doubles).

The First Round Ties in the World Group and World Group II are played on a home and away knock-out basis, and take place over a weekend in the early part of the year.

World Group Semi-finals and Final are played over on a home and away knock-out basis, and take place over a weekend in July (Semi-finals) and September (Final).

Play-off ties for World Group and World Group II will also be played on a home and away knock-out basis taking place in July.

The choice of ground for First Round, Semi-finals and Play-off ties is decided by lot or goes automatically to one of the competing nations.

As Groups I, II and III are played in a round robin format in all three zones, each event takes place at a single venue over one week. These are held in the first half of the year (to allow promotion of teams to the World Group II Play-off ties in the second half of the year), and dates and venues are decided by the BJK Cup Committee.

<text>All India Democratic Youth Organisation is the youth wing of the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist).

All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) was formed on 26 June 1966, with the stated purpose of uniting the youth of India to fight all social menaces and atrocities such as superstition, communalism, casteism, regionalism, religious fundamentalism, etc.

The All India President of the organisation is A Ramanjanappa Aldalli and the General Secretary is Prathibha Nayak.

AIDYO organises youth movements against various policies of the state and the central government which affects the youths who are analysed as anti-people, pro-capitalist, as per the ideology put forth by Shibdas Ghosh. The organisation strives to do away with what they analyse as decadent capitalist-imperialist culture and its degenerative influence (obscenity, vulgarity, obsession with sex, indulgence in narcotic alcoholism, etc.).

The organisation encourages the youth to observe the birth and death anniversaries of the great men of history who fought for secular democratic and revolutionary ideology in their time which is of social relevance even now.

Considering &quot;street theatre&quot; as a tool for social change, the organisation conducts street play festivals every year. The 17th Street Play Festival was held in Bangalore from 22 to 24 February 2013.

<text>The All India Youth Federation (AIYF) is a nationwide youth organisation of Communist Party of India founded on May 3, 1959. AIYF is affiliated to World Federation of Democratic Youth and member of general council of WFDY.

==Formation==
It was being more and more felt that without a national youth organisation and a national perspective it was not possible to build countrywide movements and to respond to the needs of the youth on an all India scale. The movement would remain isolated confined to the states

With this end in view the first conference of the All India Youth Federation was held from April 28 to May 3, 1959, in Delhi. 250 delegates and observers representing youth organisations of eleven states attended this six-day session.

Fraternal delegates also attended the conference from Bharat Yuvak Samaj, All India Students Federation, Federation of Indian Youth, All India Rural Youth Federation and the Students Union of the Calcutta University

Among the delegates from abroad, the general secretary of the WFDY and the first secretary of People&#x27;s Youth of Indonesia also attended.

The importance of the conference can be understood from the fact that it received messages of greetings from Vice-President of India Dr. Radhakrishnan, Mayor of Bombay, and several other Indian and foreign important personalities and organisations.

Mayor of Delhi Smt Aruna Asaf Ali in her speech inspired tremendous confidence among the delegates. Dr Gyanchand, the honored guest inaugurated the Conference. On the second day, the Central Law Minister A. K. Sen, Prof. Hiren Mukherjee and others, addressed the conference. They also addressed a symposium on &quot;Youth and the Nation&quot;.

The delegates from different states presented their reports. They related their experiences of mass movements and organisations and problems. The reports of West Bengal and Andhra were particularly valuable.

The deliberations convinced the delegates that the conference did not intend to create an all India organisation without a base. In fact, movements existed in the various states and flowed towards a common goal of all India nature. Therefore, the formation of an all India youth center was necessary and natural. This would make a decisive contribution to the unity of the youth movements including the unorganized ones. A united all India platform and co-ordination center would give a decisive impetus to the movement.

A good debate on the objectives and character of the all India organisation took place. The draft Policy Statement and the Constitution evoked lively discussions in which 55 delegates took part. These documents were adopted after intense debate for three days.

Sharp discussion took place on two main points of the Policy Statement. 
# Whether the AIYF should propagate socialism as one of its main aims:
# The attitude to general political questions and the political parties.

On the first point, at least it was agreed that though the broad ideas of socialism were becoming popular among youth, there also existed sharp differences on this question. Some believed in scientific socialism, others in democratic socialism and so on. Except Andhra Youth Federation, no other constituent organisation had accepted socialism as organizational aim. Even then, it was unanimously accepted that some of the basic ideas of socialism were clear to the youth. Therefore, it was finally decided that propagation of the ideas like the equality of rights and an end to class divisions should be incorporated among the aims of the AIYF.

On the second point, it was made clear by the discussion that the AIYF would not simply confine itself to sports and culture alone. These activities were important. But the AIYF would also participate in, organize and lead struggles and activities on unemployment, illiteracy, sovereignty, national independence, democracy, lack of facilities for training and health, etc. as a responsible organisation. Besides, it would participate actively in politics and political activities. Therefore, it was also a political organisation.

The All India Youth Federation made it clear that &#x27;it will not have any allegiance to any political party. The AIYF would be an independent organisation of the youth on the basis of the programme molded by the youth. Its policies would correspond to the interests of the youth of the country. At the same time, there would be no discrimination against the members and followers of any political parties as long as they abided by the aims and constitution of the organisation. There was no claim to a monopoly of youth movement. Other organisations and movements were recognized as a force. The AIYF decided to bring about co-operation among youths belonging to all the youth organisations on common issues, not only the members of particular parties, but more so the vast majority of masses following them.

Besides these two important documents, the conference adopted a Programme of Action for the ensuing months, such as observance of May 16, 1959, as anti US-Pak Pact Day, and campaigns in solidarity with the Algerian youth, etc.

Through several resolutions, the AIYF conference demanded of the government of India to liberate Goa, expressed solidarity with the colonial peoples, and wished success for the Geneva conference and asked for urgent attention to the problem of unemployment in preparation of the third five-year plan.

The AIYF conference decided to affiliate itself to the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and thus to be a part of world youth movement. In its opinion, the WFDY was the only worldwide organisation with an understanding of world situation, being consistent in the fight against colonialism. The World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) was founded in London in 1945 in the wake of the victory over world fascism led by Hitler. Youth had played a great in the Second World War to defeat the forces of Germany, Japan and Italy. The WFDY was the result of this young optimism after Second World War.

The conference elected a council of 121 members, which in turn elected a 37-member executive committee and office bearers.

The famous film personality Balraj Sahani was elected president of the AIYF and Sarada Mitra the general secretary. Among the vice-presidents were P.K. Vasudevan Nair, Chintamani Panigrahi, Krishna Chandra Chaudhary, Sukumar Gupta and Satyanarayan. Vasudevan Nair also acted as the chairman of the Executive Committee. The secretaries were Sushil Chakravarty, Ganesh Vidyarthi and Desraj Goel, two seats remaining vacant.

At that time, the AIYF represented more than two lakh youths of the country, who were the members of the constituent units; it was poised to become a bigger organisation.

==History==

The All India Youth Federation (AIYF) came into being in 1959. Till that year constituent units and organizations existed independently in the various states and regions of India. The different state, district and local democratic youth organizations used to function separately, though there was some kind of co-ordination between them to a lesser or greater degree. The separate youth organizations, which later formed the AIYF, were gradually evolving common aims and objects, and in the course of time felt the need for an organisation at national level. Firebrand Communist and the youngest Councillor of Delhi MCD, Guru Radha Kishan took initiative to organise the first meet of upcoming organisation, to be held in Delhi.

The foundation conference of the All India Youth Federation was held in New Delhi, from 28 April to 3 May 1959. The six-day session, was attended by over 250 delegates and observers, from 11 states. The conference announced the formation of the AIYF. The conference decided that the AIYF would propagate the ideas of socialism. It decided to affiliate with the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and thus to be a part of world youth movement.. Famous artist and film personality Balraj Sahani was elected as the first president of AIYF and Sarada Mitra as General Secretary. P.K. Vasudevan Nair was elected the chairman of the executive committee of the AIYF.

===First conference, 1959===

The first conference of the All India Youth Federation was held from 28 April to 3 May 1959 in Delhi. 250 delegates and observers representing youth organizations of eleven (11) states attended this six-day session. The conference elected a council of 121 members, which in turn elected a 37-member executive committee and office bearers.

===Second conference, 1961===

The second conference of the All India Youth Federation was held in Hyderabad from 19 to 21 May 1961. 306 delegates and observers from 12 states attended the conference. They freely and frankly discussed the issues affecting the life of the youth of the country. A large number of fraternal delegates were present e.g. from WFDY, Czechoslovak Youth Union, and Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth League of Ceylon. Similarly, the other Indian organisations, which sent delegates, were Youth Hostels Association. Socialist Youth League, AISF, AITUC, All India Kisan Sabha.

===Third conference, 1965-66 ===

The Pondicherry conference was a success beyond expectations and broke all the previous records. It was held from 29 December 1965 to 3 January 1966 in Pondicherry. About 600 delegates participated, which was quite revealing. It showed that the AIYF was gradually winning over the youth. The tremendous potentials of the AIYF induced many delegates to join the conference.

Adoption of scientific socialism:

The adoption of scientific socialism by the conference as the aim of the AIYF was a significant decision. It provided a new ideological orientation to the organisation. Great controversies and heated debates were generated before and during the conference on whether it should be adopted as the aim of the organisation or not. One major opinion was that adoption of scientific socialism would restrict the scope of AIYF. Many young people would then not join it thinking that it was attached to a particular ideology of Marxism.

The other major opinion was that socialism has become quite common and popular, and had been adopted in one form or the other, by almost all the political parties. As we know, even BJP (then Jan Sangh) had begun talking of &quot;humanist&quot; or &quot;Gandhian&quot; socialism! Therefore, AIYF must adopt and popularize scientific socialism as distinct from several other socialisms that were in circulation. That would impart a clear-cut direction and perspective to the youth. Acceptance of scientific socialism was of course, not a precondition to the membership of AIYF. The AIYF would educate the youth and its members in this ideology.

===Fourth conference, 1969===

The fourth conference of All India Youth Federation was held from 26 to 28 December 1969 in Delhi. It was attended by over three hundred delegates from all over India and was inaugurated by S.A. Dange. The conference was also attended by several foreign delegates from Vietnam, Rumania, USSR, Bulgaria, WFDY, etc.

The conference discussed the youth issues in three commissions. These commissions were on working report and organizational problems, &quot;present situation and the tasks of the youth&quot;, and programme of action.

The conference decided that the main task of the organisation was to mobilize the younger generation for democratic and political movements through ideological education on the basis of scientific socialism.

===Fifth conference, 1974===

The fifth conference of AIYF was held in Cochin from 17 to 20 January 1974.

The period since 1969 Delhi conference was one of unprecedented political and social upheavals. The Congress had split, banks had been nationalized, privy purses withdrawn and new possibilities for the growth of left, democratic and progressive forces had opened up. Progressive forces were on the advance and new alignment of forces and parties was taking place. Polarisation between progressive and reactionary forces was developing.

The reports from the states in the conference assessed the tremendous impact of these and other events on the youth and student movements. They also reviewed the role of youth in the mass movements of the period. Struggles on sectional and general demands were reviewed. Assuming a correct ideological standpoint, the AIYF had expanded its mass base and influence. This was reflected in the fact that while only 300 delegates has participated in Delhi (1969) conference, 975 delegates and 117 observers attended the Cochin AIYF conference. Only Meghalaya and Jammu &amp; Kashmir went un-represented. Out of this number, 405 were young workers, 19 doctors, 54 advocates and 87 students. So far as their educational background was concerned 306 were graduates, 240 matriculates, 29 illiterates, and the rest had elementary or secondary education.

Question of ideology:

Both the youth and student conferences finally settled the question of ideology. They unanimously adopted Marxism–Leninism as the guide to revolutionary practice. The respective national councils reached the decision in June 1972 in Hyderabad after prolonged discussions.

This did not mean that the character of AIYF and AISF would be restricted as mass organisations. The AIYF would continue to attract and enroll common youths of factories, farms, universities, services, unemployed etc. They would be drawn into various spheres of sports, culture, physical training, entertainment, etc. At the same time attempts would be made to lead them into struggles on the specific demands.

The youth would be educated and politicised in the theory of Marxism–Leninism after they joined.

===Sixth conference, 1979===

The sixth conference of All India Youth Federation was held in Hyderabad from 15 to 17 May 1979. The conference gave a clarion call to the youth to fight the RSS seriously and to defend secularism and national unity. The dangerous growth of RSS was a serious threat to the nation in the wake of the formation of Janata Dal government in 1977. The RSS and its concept of Hindu Rashtra had acquired new aggressiveness. It penetrated into police, bureaucracy and government institutions. The conference called upon the youth to meet the RSS threat and to chalk out a programme of action on all India basis.

===Seventh conference, 1983===

The seventh conference of the AIYF was held in Patna from 13 to 16 January 1983. AIYF decided to continue &#x27;job or jail&#x27;campaign in a more militant manner by organising padayatras at all levels, with the main padayatras in a few selected centers. They were to cover villages throughout the country and were to culminate in Delhi March.

About 1200 delegates attended the conference from all the states. It was great success. Fraternal delegates from 15 countries were also present.

===Eighth conference, 1985===

The eighth conference of All India Youth Federation was held from 1 to 3 November 1985 in Bilaspur, Madhya Pradesh 600 delegates attended it from all the states, also by foreign delegates from several countries. The venue of the conference was named after Sarada Mitra, the founder general secretary of AIYF. The hall in which the delegates session took place was named after the recently hanged young South African poet and freedom fighter Benjamin Moloise.

In a resolution, AIYF demanded immediate release of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela. The conference also hoped that the forthcoming Geneva conference between USA and USSR would come out with positive results.

===Ninth conference, 1990===

The ninth conference of AIYF was held from 3 to 6 May 1990 in Cochin (Kerala). Its mammoth rally gave a stirring call to all the progressive, democratic and secular youth organisations to fight for the task. &quot;Save India, Change India&quot;.

The conference had the defence of national unity and secularism as its running theme. It decided to organise a march to Parliament on September 13, 1990, with the slogan &quot;Save India, Change India&quot;.

600 delegates from all over India attended the Cochin conference. In the end, a declaration was adopted. Several other resolutions were also passed.

AIYF decided to initiate the following campaigns:

It was decided to organise seminars in July 1990 on national unity and secularism, right to work, job or unemployment allowance.
# Campaign fortnight from 15 to 30 August at local levels through padayatras, cycle rallies, processions etc.
# All India March to the Parliament on 13 September 1990.

===Tenth conference, 1993===

The tenth conference of All India Youth Federation was held from 26 to 29 September 1993 in Sangrur (Punjab). It was attended by 427 delegates, and by 34 foreign guests.

The conference started with a massive rally on 26 September in which thousands of rural youth participated. The rally was addressed by the general secretary of CPI Indrajit Gupta, well known film personality A.K. Hangal, president of WFDY, Andle Yawa and several others.

===Eleventh conference, 1996===

Eleventh national conference of All India Youth Federation was held in Calcutta from 8 to 11 December 1996. Delegates from at least twenty states had reached Calcutta. Presence of 35 fraternal delegates from different countries greatly inspired the participants. The conference was attended by 869 delegates and 25 observers. The conference demanded creation of a national youth fund to assist generation of self-employment. It urged the government to lift the ban upon recruitment.

The existing National Youth Policy (NYP) did not accord with the present situation, and therefore the UF government should come out with a new NYP. Broad participation of youth from the grass root level in the decision – making process alone could ensure evolution of a comprehensive youth policy aimed at their better future.

===Twelfth conference, 2003===

The twelfth national conference of the AIYF was held from 2 to 5 April 2003 in Patna (Bihar). It was attended by 600 delegates from 23 states.

<text>Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group International Limited is a multinational hospitality and management group focusing on luxury hotels, resorts, and residences, with a total of 43 properties worldwide, 20 of which it wholly or partially owns.

The Mandarin Oriental name was established in 1985 following the merger of Mandarin International Hotels Limited and the holding company of the hotel &quot;The Oriental&quot;, in which Mandarin had already acquired a 49% stake in 1974. Mandarin&#x27;s history traces back to the 1963 opening of its namesake hotel &quot;The Mandarin&quot; (now Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong), whereas &quot;The Oriental&quot; (now Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok) had opened in 1876 as the Kingdom of Siam&#x27;s first luxury hotel.

Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group is a subsidiary of the publicly-traded Mandarin Oriental International Limited, which in turn is a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson.

==History==

Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer, and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.

However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963 in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which closed in 2019, opened in Causeway Bay.

In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two &quot;flagship&quot; hotels.

In 1985, the company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of &quot;Mandarin Oriental International Limited.&quot; Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Hong Kong, manages the activities of the group&#x27;s hotels.

== Marketing ==

Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the &quot;Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental&quot; at all hotels. In June 2006, the Moments of Delight video was slightly updated to add several new scenes and in October 2014, the video featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding, accompanied by new music.

===Beijing building fire during construction (2009)===

On 9 February 2009, the Beijing Television Cultural Center, which was to be completed in May 2009 and incorporate a Mandarin Oriental hotel, caught fire due to unauthorized fireworks celebrating the Chinese New Year. One fireman died in the incident, and the structure was severely damaged but did not collapse and underwent repair. However, the Mandarin Oriental hotel ultimately opened at a different location at Wangfujing, near the Beijing Hotel.

===Credit card breach (2015)===
In March 2015, several Mandarin Oriental hotels were affected by a point-of-sale systems security breach.

===Hyde Park fire (2018)===
On 6 June 2018, a fire (believed to have been caused by welding work) damaged the park-facing exterior of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park in London. Although there were no injuries, the fire closed the hotel and caused a significant setback to the (then) near-complete renovation work, which involved interior designer Joyce Wang. The hotel returned to full operation on 15 April 2019.

<text>Golden Gala is an annual track and field event normally held at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, Italy. Previously one of the IAAF Golden League events, it is now part of the Diamond League. Following the 2013 death of Italian sprinting legend Pietro Mennea, the organizers added his name to the title of the meet.

The 2021 and 2023 events were temporarily relocated to Florence.

==History==
Primo Nebiolo, the Italian president of IAAF since 1981, was the founder of the Golden Gala and had the idea to bring the athletes and the people from the United States and the NATO countries together after their boycott of the Moscow Olympics in 1980 as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Nebiolo died of a heart attack at age 76 in 1999.

At the 2009 edition of the Golden Gala, Kenenisa Bekele, Kerron Stewart, Sanya Richards and Yelena Isinbayeva all remained on target for the 2009 Golden League jackpot. In the 100 m, Tyson Gay equalled his American record and Daniel Bailey set an Antiguan record in the men&#x27;s race. Antonietta Di Martino brought the sole Italian victory in Rome by beating off favourite Blanka Vlašić in the high jump.

==Editions==
In 1981 the IAAF World Cup was held in Rome, so no Golden Gala meeting was organized.


==World records==
Over the course of its history, ten world records have been set at the Gala. The 1500 metres and Mile records by Hicham El Guerrouj still stand. In 2014 Joanne Pavey&#x27;s 15:04.87 in the 5000 metres bettered the existing masters world record in the W40 division by almost 16 seconds.

<text>Beth Ehlers (born 1968) is an American actress. She is known for playing Harley Cooper, between 1987 and 2008, on CBS&#x27;s daytime drama &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

==Career==
Ehlers grew up in New York City and begin appearing in television commercials at the age of nine. As a child actress, her first role was in the 1981 television film &quot;Family Reunion&quot; starring Bette Davis. She was cast in several other television films, including &quot;In Defense of Kids&quot; and &quot;Mystery at Fire Island&quot;. Her big screen debut was in the film &quot;The Hunger&quot; with David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve. She was also featured in the feature film &quot;Hiding Out&quot; and the NBC TV series &quot;The Best Times&quot; which was in the vein of &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, and the later, &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;.

To date, Ehlers&#x27; role of note has been her portrayal of Harley Cooper on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a role she originally played from 1987 to 1993. The character of Harley was a bad girl with a heart of gold — the character was introduced giving birth to her illegitimate daughter in the back seat of a car — and Ehlers&#x27; portrayal won her praise and many fans, eventually making the character of Harley a linchpin character.

Ehlers left the show in 1993, along with co-star Mark Derwin, to relocate to California. After her relationship with Derwin ended, Ehlers worked as a production assistant on commercials and music videos. On January 17, 1997, she returned to &quot;Guiding Light&quot; for the soap&#x27;s 60th anniversary. Fan response was so overwhelmingly positive that the producers asked Ehlers to return as a contract player. During her time on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, she was nominated five times for a Daytime Emmy (for Outstanding Younger Actress, in 1992 and 1993; Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, in 1999 and 2002; and, in 2006, for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series). She was the first daytime actress to ever be nominated in all three categories.

In 2005, fans voted Ehlers and former co-star Ricky Paull Goldin, as their characters Harley and Gus, the top couple in &quot;The Most Irresistible Combination&quot; contest (which was partially sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble, the company that produces &quot;Guiding Light&quot;).

In 2006, Ehlers became part of a collaboration between the show and Marvel Comics when her character was tagged to appear on a special fantasy episode of the show as a superheroine, named &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; after the show itself.

In 2007, in an episode celebrating the 70th anniversary of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, the current cast portrayed actors and behind-the-scenes personnel from the early years of the series (both in radio and television). Ehlers had a central role in the episode with her portrayal of Irna Phillips. Phillips was the creator of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and many other soap operas; she was often credited with creating the soap opera genre.

In June 2008, Ehlers left &quot;Guiding Light&quot; to join the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot; in the newly created role of Taylor Thompson, an Army lieutenant of the Iraqi war who believed she had lost her fiancé, Brot Monroe (portrayed by real-life war veteran and now actor/spokesman J.R. Martinez), in action. The move from &quot;Guiding Light&quot; to &quot;All My Children&quot; led to an onscreen reunion with her former &quot;Guiding Light&quot; co-star Ricky Paull Goldin, who had also moved to &quot;All My Children&quot; to portray Dr. Joseph &quot;Jake&quot; Martin.

In 2010 Ehlers was announced to be in the cast of The SFN&#x27;s television series &quot;River Ridge&quot;. In 2020, she joined the cast of the serial drama podcast Forever and a Day.

<doc id="1108917" wikidata="Q5395567" url="?curid=1108917" title="Æbleskiver">
<text>Æbleskiver (, [singular: &quot;æbleskive&quot;]) are spherical Danish snacks made from fried batter. The name literally means &quot;apple slices&quot; in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. The crust is similar in texture to European pancakes, but with a light and fluffy interior similar to a Yorkshire pudding. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver, ebleskiver or ebelskiver.

==Æbleskive pan==

Æbleskiver are cooked on the stove top using a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron which has increased heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.

==Preparation==

The batter for æbleskiver usually includes wheat flour, which is mixed with buttermilk, milk or cream, eggs, sugar, and salt. Some recipes also include fat (usually butter), cardamom and lemon zest to improve taste, and a leavening agent, most often baking powder, but sometimes yeast, to aerate the batter.

Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the æbleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of apple (&quot;æble&quot;) or applesauce inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, black currant or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Butter, maple syrup, and whipped cream are also popular toppings.

Æbleskiver are often bought fried and frozen at supermarkets and then heated in the oven at home.

==Traditions==

In Denmark, æbleskiver are less common in restaurants than they are at casual family gatherings. They can also be found being sold by street vendors in the winter. They are traditionally served with jam and powdered sugar and three are placed on a plate at a time. They are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gløgg (Scandinavian mulled wine). They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, open-air events, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children&#x27;s birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.

In North America there are several annual events that celebrate æbleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding &quot;Æbleskiver Suppers&quot; and similar events.

== History ==

The exact origin of æbleskiver is unknown. One popular speculation is that a band of Vikings were part of a difficult battle. When they returned to their ship, they wished to cook a meal similar to pancakes. However, since they lacked regular pans, they instead used their shields or helmets, resulting in a cake with a spherical shape.

According to another explanation, the custom of making a special sliced-apple dish originated in the Middle Ages when it was impossible to store raw apples beyond a certain date. The last apples of the year&#x27;s harvest were sliced, used to flavor gløgg, scooped out of the gløgg, wrapped in dough, and fried in fat or butter like a Berliner. This is the origin of the name, which means &quot;apple slices&quot;. In the 17th century, as cast iron pans with hemispherical concavities became available, æbleskiver could be easily made throughout the year, and the variety of fruit and other fillings expanded.
The first appearance of the word &quot;æbleskiver&quot; occurs in &quot;Peters Jul&quot; (1866), a book of Yule poems by Johan Krohn (1841–1925; son of Frederik Christopher Krohn and brother of Pietro Krohn). &quot;Apple-filled æbleskiver&quot; are also mentioned in the 1872 story &quot;The Cripple&quot; (&quot;Krøblingen&quot;) by Hans Christian Andersen.

In the United States, pans were manufactured by Griswold Manufacturing.

<text>Poffertjes () are traditional Dutch batter cakes. Resembling small, fluffy pancakes, they are made with yeast and buckwheat flour. Typically, &quot;poffertjes&quot; are sweet treats served with powdered sugar and butter, and sometimes syrup or advocaat. A savoury variant with gouda cheese is also made.

==History==

The first mention of Poffertjes is credited to a 1746 appendix to the cookbook &quot;Volmaakte Hollandsche keuken-meid&quot;.

Poffertjes were first seen at a fair in Amsterdam in 1746. They are also known as &#x27;brothers&#x27;. The Catholic Church claims they invented them, but there are doubts about that claim.

==Serving==
&quot;Poffertjes&quot; are a festive holiday treat in the Netherlands, popular at both summer festivals and Christmas markets. Mainly in the winter season temporary stands selling &quot;poffertjes&quot; are quite popular and sell portions containing one or two dozen. Usually the cook prepares them fresh for the customer. They are sold on a small cardboard (sometimes plastic) plate and come with a small disposable fork the size of a pastry fork. &quot;Poffertjes&quot; are not difficult to prepare, but a special cast iron pan or copper pan (also available in aluminium with Teflon coating) with several shallow indentations in the bottom is required.

Almost all Dutch supermarkets (like Albert Heijn, Lidl and Jumbo) sell ready-made &quot;poffertjes&quot; that only need to be microwaved, and are sold complete with a sachet of powdered sugar and a small serving of butter. Supermarkets also stock mixes for &quot;poffertjes&quot;, to which only eggs and milk need to be added. Usually they contain a leavening agent such as baking powder.

&quot;Poffertjes&quot; can also be served with other sweet garnishes, such as syrup, whipped cream or strawberries, for added flavour.

&quot;Poffertjes&quot; are also known in Indonesian cuisine through its historical ties as the former Dutch colony. 
==Similar dishes==
&quot;Poffertjes&quot; are thought to be related to and to have influenced the Indonesian &quot;kue cubit&quot;. &quot;Poffertjes&quot; have some similarities with Indian &quot;paniyaram&quot; and Hong Kong egg waffles, but differ in many aspects. The Danish æbleskiver pancakes are quite similar.

<text>One Boston Place, also known as the Boston Company Building, is a 41-story office tower located in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. With a height of , One Boston Place is the 7th-tallest building in the city. Despite its simple appearance, One Boston Place has become a major Boston landmark due to its distinctive diagonal exterior bracing and unusual rooftop &quot;box&quot; design. Completed in 1970, the skyscraper has served as home to several law, financial, real estate, and corporate firms. Bank of New York Mellon is currently (July 2007) the primary tenant of the building.

==History==
Designed by architect Pietro Belluschi and developed by Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes, construction of One Boston Place began in November 1967, and the first tenants occupied the building in March 1970.

==Design and features==
One Boston Place has a steel frame construction with a masonry core. The building contains eighteen passenger elevators and one freight elevator, which were renovated in 2005. The lobby entrance features a planar glass wall system. The diagonal exterior bracing is characteristic of the architectural movement structural expressionism.

In October 2007, One Boston Place was recognized by the EPA&#x27;s ENERGY STAR program.

In November 2008, One Boston Place became the first building in the world to earn a Gold level of certification through the US Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance (LEED EB O&amp;M) rating system. The building&#x27;s environmental highlights include a highly reflective white roof and hardscape, the use of native vegetation on the building&#x27;s plaza, and strong support of indoor air quality standards.

<doc id="1108930" wikidata="Q1520491" url="?curid=1108930" title="Stagsden">
<text>Stagsden is a small but historic village and civil parish located in the Borough of Bedford, northwest Bedfordshire, England, near the Buckinghamshire border. Situated around west of Bedford town centre on one of the main routes between it and Milton Keynes, the village was bypassed by the A422 in April 1992, to allow the increasing amount of traffic to avoid the 30 mph speed limit in Stagsden.

The village has at its centre St. Leonard&#x27;s Church, where High Street, Bedford Road and Church Lane all meet. Toward the western end of the village, along High Street, is the Royal George pub (now closed) and the Village Hall (formerly the primary school). The village&#x27;s history is well preserved, and several millennium projects centred on such preservation for future generations.

In 2000, Stagsden acquired two new additions to village life. A Millennium bench was put in place at the corner of Bedford Road and the High Street, and Bedfordshire Golf Club opened its newly built course on the hillside facing the village, on the other side of the A422.

A latecomer to the 21st century is the village sign, next to the church, which is a quintessentially rural affair and is rather splendid.

For electoral purposes the village is part of Turvey ward and is represented on Bedford Borough Council by Mark Smith, elected in May 2007.

Half a mile east of Stagsden and inside the parish boundary is Hanger Wood, an ancient woodland and Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Stagsden is home to the British Tripod Brand, 3 Legged Thing. The brand stamps the name &quot;Stagsden&quot; onto each and every product that they manufacture as a tribute to the village. 3 Legged Thing is situated in two Chicken Sheds ( Shedquarters [Unit 9] &amp; Return of the Shedi [Unit 10] ), on the site of Kinsbourne Farm, Bury End, previously a poultry farm that was home to over 30,000 chickens.

<text>One Devonshire Place is a modern skyscraper in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts directly across the street from One Boston Place. Built in 1983, it stands tall, housing 42 floors.

The tower is mixed-use, with 8 floors of offices and 35 of residential space (including a basement level). The building is built on two levels, with the Washington Street side a full story higher than the Devonshire side. There is an open driveway passing through the bottom level between these streets, a rarity for a skyscraper. The building includes a heated indoor pool and a fitness center.

==Education==
The towers are zoned to Boston Public Schools.

For elementary and middle school, students may apply to:
* Any school within the location&#x27;s &quot;assignment zone&quot;
**In this case, the North Zone 
* Any school within the location&#x27;s &quot;walk zone,&quot; regardless of the school&#x27;s &quot;assignment zone.&quot;
**Eligible &quot;walk zone&quot; schools not citywide and not within the North Zone: None known
* Any citywide elementary school, middle school, and K-8

All high schools are considered &quot;citywide&quot;.

<doc id="1108957" wikidata="Q2840808" url="?curid=1108957" title="Tollerton, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Tollerton is an English village and civil parish in the Rushcliffe district of Nottinghamshire, just south-east of Nottingham. Statistics from the 2021 census show the population of the village has increased to 1,915.

==Governance==
Tollerton has a parish council and is represented on Rushcliffe Borough Council. It is part of the Rushcliffe constituency in the House of Commons.

==Tollerton Hall==
St Hugh&#x27;s College was founded in 1948 at Tollerton Hall by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nottingham as its junior seminary, accepting boys from aged 11 upwards, but by 1969 it had opened its doors to secular students. It closed in 1986, leaving the hall as a corporate HQ until June 2017, when it was bought by a businessman, Ian Kershaw, for use as a private home again.

==Event and amenities==
There is an annual village fayre held in June. This gathers residents around craft stalls, entertainments, refreshments and small exhibitions. The money generated helps local charities.

The pub named the &quot;Air Hostess&quot; recalls Nottingham Airport at Tollerton. It is unusual in having a piste for playing pétanque. It used to have a large carved sign depicting an air hostess. However, in 2011, the then owners of the premises, Everards Brewery, decided to refurbish them and in doing so replaced the original sign with a conventional hanging sign depicting an air hostess. This changed to a hanging sign depicting Tollerton Hall, an aircraft and fields. A scheme was put in operation to save the pub from closure by introducing local ownership. This led to the establishment of a community trust, in which shares were issued, and the pub freehold was purchased. It reopened with a new tenant landlord in July 2020.

Tollerton has two churches. St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church dates from the end of the 12th century. Developments in 1909 resulted in the church as it is today. There is a Methodist church located in a modern building at the village&#x27;s southern border.

The few shops include a post office, a petrol station which includes a mini Waitrose, and a restaurant serving oriental-style food, The Charde. The village is host to a hairdressers, a pet shop and a pet salon. The Parish Rooms at the end of the parade of shops in Burnside Grove serve as a centre for local community activities and meetings. Regular pop up shops visit the village.

Outdoor amenities include a park with an multi-use games area for five-a-side football, basketball and tennis and a full-sized grass main football pitch. 

The park was refurbished with new children&#x27;s play equipment in April 2008 and again more recently through the active Tollerton project. This added the first interactive play equipment in Rushcliffe, the largest single piece of adventure play equipment produced for a UK park by manufacturer Produlic and a community gym.

==Education==
Tollerton Primary School takes children of 5–11 years of age. It is a member of Equals Trust Multi Academy Trust, based in nearby Keyworth.

Tollerton Playgroup, next to the primary in Burnside Grove, caters for children under five. The nearest secondary school is South Wolds Academy and Sixth Form in Keyworth.

==Economy==
Tollerton is within easy commuting distance of Nottingham, Newark, Leicester and Loughborough. The village has good internet access allowing many residents to work from home. Agricultural employment remains, along with various local businesses. Just outside the village is Nottingham Airport where prospective pilots can receive training in either fixed-wing light aircraft or various rotary helicopters. The airport retains a fully-functioning air traffic control tower. Trained aviation mechanics, electricians, and electronics specialists work at the airport, as well as professional aviation instructors. Located on the edge of the airport is a private hospital and a computer furniture maker.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is Nottingham, five miles to the north-west. Tollerton is served by two bus stops in Melton Road for &quot;The Keyworth&quot; Trent Barton service between Keyworth and Nottingham city centre. At peak times it runs every 15 minutes.

The southern edge of the village lies on Melton Road (A606), adjacent to Wheatcroft Roundabout, where the A52 and the A606 meet. This provides good links from the village to Nottingham, the M1 motorway, and surrounding places such as Melton Mowbray and Leicester.

==Freedom of the Parish==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Parish of Tollerton.

<doc id="1108971" wikidata="Q1164330" url="?curid=1108971" title="Social Democratic Youth of Denmark">
<text>The Social Democratic Youth of Denmark (, DSU) is the national youth wing of the Danish Social Democrats. It is not to be confused with Frit Forum, which is for those in higher education, and whose membership is not restricted by age, unlike the DSU. The organisation is autonomous from the Social Democrats and as such is entitled to formulate its own policies and devise its own campaigns.

The Social Democratic Youth movement was established in 1920 after a break-up of the former youth organisation, the Social Democratic Youth League (&quot;&quot;, SUF). At first, the organisation was known as the &quot;DsU&quot;. The founders of DSU wanted to change the Danish society by gradual reforms and not by revolution.

The Social Democratic Youth of Denmark is independent of the Social Democrats. This allows them to formulate their own policies and make their own campaigns. Prominent Social Democrats beginning their political work in the Social Democratic Youth include prime ministers Hans Hedtoft, H. C. Hansen, Jens Otto Krag, Anker Jørgensen and Mette Frederiksen, as well as ministers Per Hækkerup and Morten Bødskov.

== Affiliations ==
DSU is a member of Dansk Ungdoms Fællesråd (DUF), the Forbundet Nordens Socialdemokratiske Ungdom (FNSU), the Young European Socialists (YES) and the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).

== Chairs ==

The incumbent chair of Social Democratic Youth is Katrine Evelyn Jensen, who was elected at the DSU 2022 Congress in May. The general secretary of the DSU is Signe Kaulberg Jespersen, who was also elected at the 2022 Congress in May.

Former DSU chairs:
== Organisation ==
The legislative and most powerful assembly is the national convention, held every second year in April or May. It consists of 235 delegates, mainly elected in the local branches. The convention is approving the annual accounts of the national organisation, it is deciding new organizational work programmes, political resolutions and proposals and is finally electing a national executive committee.

The national executive committee (&quot;Forretningsudvalget&quot;) consists of 10 elected members and also the chairperson, the vice-chairperson and the secretary general. They are elected at the convention too. The chairperson, the vice-chairperson and the secretary general are receiving an economic compensation/fee for their jobs.

Above the national executive committee, DSU has a kind of &quot;second chamber&quot;, the major council &quot;Hovedbestyrelsen&quot;, which consists of the national executive committee (13 members) and 29 local representatives, elected in the 10 regions. The Social Democrats and Frit Forum, the Social Democrats&#x27; student wing, have one observer each. &quot;Hovedbestyrelsen&quot; is also the highest the most powerful assembly between conventions.

DSU has three different nationwide, permanent committees with members from all levels in the organization and from everywhere in Denmark. The committees have the following topics and tasks:
* Activities and seminars (planning of national events etc.) (abb. &quot;AKU&quot; )
* International affairs and cooperation (abb. &quot;IU&quot;)
* Editor&#x27;s group, Members&#x27; magazine (&quot;DSU&#x27;eren&quot;)

DSU is divided into 10 regions, following the borders of the Danish major constituencies. Each region has a regional executive committee and is every year electing their local representatives to &quot;Hovedbestyrelsen&quot;.

DSU has around 60 local branches, though these may come and go at any moment and is therefore not an exact figure. The local branches are responsible for local activities and local campaigns. DSU has in the local communities an important role in the campaign work for the Social Democrats. Especially when it comes to door-to-door campaigning, inspired from the 2008 Obama election campaign, the DSU has an important role.

<text>Booker Little Jr. (April 2, 1938 – October 5, 1961) was an American jazz trumpeter and composer. He appeared on many recordings in his short career, both as a sideman and as a leader. Little performed with Max Roach, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy and was strongly influenced by Sonny Rollins and Clifford Brown. He died aged 23.

==Early life ==
Booker Little Jr. was born in Memphis, Tennessee to Booker, a Pullman porter who was a trombonist, and his wife Ophelia Little, who was a church organist. He also was the brother of Helena, Vivian, and Vera Little (Vera later sung with the London Opera Company). From such a musically inclined family, Little naturally gravitated towards music at a young age. His first instrument was trombone (like his father), but he switched to clarinet at the age of 12. At 14, his band director urged him to switch to trumpet, and he settled on the instrument quickly. In 1952, Little started attending Manassas High School where he continued his development on trumpet and later graduated. Being in Memphis, Little was able to further develop his talent with contemporaries such as Phineas Newborn Jr., George Coleman, Frank Strozier, and his cousin Louis Smith. He was performing with Newborn on a casual basis by his mid-teens.

After graduating, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to continue his studies at the Chicago Conservatory in 1954. At the conservatory, he continued to study trumpet but also incorporated studies in composition, theory, and orchestration with a minor in piano. He would later on graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in his main instrument. As a sophomore, Little met Sonny Rollins. For about nine months, they both stayed at the YMCA where Rollins would influence Little greatly by encouraging him to find his own sound versus mimicking other musicians.

== Career ==

=== 1958-1959: First recordings with Max Roach + 4 ===
While attending a recording session with Rollins, Little met drummer Max Roach in 1955. Following the death of Clifford Brown the next year, Little became Roach&#x27;s trumpet player in his band Max Roach Four. Being in school interfered with the quality of his performance, and he was replaced by Kenny Dorham. Following graduation, Little rejoined Roach&#x27;s band, reclaiming his spot from Dorham in 1958. In that band, he reunited with one of his friends from Memphis, George Coleman. As trumpeter, Little made his recording debut on &quot;Max Roach + 4 on the Chicago Scene&quot; in June. He was featured on pieces like &quot;My Old Flame&quot;. Little recorded two more albums with the group, which Roach altered by replacing the piano with tuba player Ray Draper. On &quot;Max Roach + 4 at Newport,&quot; Little introduced his first composition, &quot;Minor Mode&quot;, and on &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot; he was the main soloist. On their album, &quot;Deeds, Not Words&quot;, in the opening piece, &quot;You Stepped Out of a Dream&quot;, Little displayed his arranging skills, where the tenor sax, trumpet and tuba share similar voicings that created tension and sophisticated musicality within the unusual piano-less group. Little had a hand in the majority of the arranging on the &quot;Deeds, Not Words&quot; album.

In October, the group appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Stars of Jazz&quot; television program. Also during October, Little recorded his first album as a leader, &quot;Booker Little 4 and Max Roach&quot; (also known as &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;) with Roach on drums, Coleman on tenor, and Davis on bass (with Tommy Flanagan on piano). On &quot;The Defiant Ones,&quot; Little played three of his original pieces, &quot;Rounders Mode&quot;, &quot;Dungeons Waltz&quot;, and &quot;Jewels Tempo&quot;. Following his first album as leader, Little and &quot;Max Roach + 4&quot; recorded one more album before the end of 1958 titled &quot;Award-Winning Drummer&quot; under Roach&#x27;s name and another titled &quot;Many Sides of Max Roach&quot; in 1959 (the second album was not released until 1964). &quot;Many Sides of Max Roach&quot; was the last album Booker Little recorded with Roach&#x27;s group until 1960.

===1959-1960: Freelancing===
During his leave, Little freelanced around New York developing new acquaintances with musicians such as John Coltrane, Slide Hampton, and Teddy Charles. He was present on two of the four tracks of a reunion album with his old friends Coleman, Strozier, Smith, Phineas Newborn Jr., Calvin Newborn, George Joyner, and Charles Crosby titled &quot;Down Home Reunion&quot;, credited as by Young Men From Memphis, where the group displayed their interests in blues music. Through the course of the end of 1959 and early 1960, Little featured and worked on albums such as &quot;Slide!&quot;, &quot;Bill Henderson Sings,&quot; and the last album he recorded before returning to Roach&#x27;s group, &quot;Fantastic Frank Strozier&quot;. In addition, he also recorded his second album as a lead simply titled &quot;Booker Little&quot; for Bob Shad&#x27;s Time label where he introduced his original compositions such as &#x27;&quot;Opening Statement&quot;, &quot;Minor Sweet&quot;, &quot;Bee Tee&#x27;s minor Plea&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;s a Little Blue&quot; and &quot;The Grand Valse&quot;.

=== 1960-1961: Eric Dolphy and final recordings ===

In 1960, Little rejoined Roach&#x27;s band and recorded 14 albums from April 1960 to September 1961. Following his return, Little took on a bigger role being music director and composing more music for the group. The first album Roach recorded with Little as trumpeter was &quot;We Insist! - Freedom Now Suite&quot;. Little continued to work with Roach but soon met Eric Dolphy. The combination of Little and Dolphy presented the possibility of the dawning of a new sound of music. At the beginning of their newfound association, Dolphy recorded &quot;Far Cry&quot; with Little on trumpet. In addition, Little also recorded his third album as lead &quot;Out Front&quot;. This album &quot;Out Front&quot; was a result of his work on &quot;We Insist!&quot; Following the recording of &quot;We Insist&quot;, Little was hired by Nat Hentoff to write for Candid Records.

With Dolphy, he co-led a residency at the Five Spot club in New York in June 1961, from which three albums were eventually issued by the Prestige label titled &quot;Eric Dolphy at the Five Spot Volumes 1&amp;2&quot; and the &quot;Memorial Album&quot;. It was during this period that he began to show promise of expanding the expressive range of the &quot;vernacular&quot; bebop idiom which originated with Clifford Brown, his most immediate influence as a performer. Booker Little recorded his final album with Roach in August 1961 titled &quot;Percussion Bitter Sweet&quot; with Dolphy on sax and recorded his last and final album as leader entitled &quot;Booker Little and Friend&quot; (also known as &quot;Victory and Sorrow&quot;).

After years of physical pain, Little died of complications resulting from uremia on October 5, 1961, in New York City at the age 23. He was survived by his wife, two sons Booker T. III and Larry Cornelius, and two daughters Cornelia and Ana Dorsey.

<text>The London Oratory School, also known as &quot;The Oratory&quot; or &quot;The London Oratory&quot; to distinguish it from other schools, is a Catholic comprehensive secondary school for boys aged 7–18 and girls aged 16–18 in West Brompton. Founded in 1863 by The Fathers of The London Oratory then in Chelsea, London, it is historically linked to two fellow Oratorian institutions: the nearby Brompton Oratory and The Oratory School in Oxfordshire. The school is known for the quality of its choral and instrumental music and is one of England&#x27;s oldest Catholic schools. The London Oratory School was named in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as one of the &#x27;Top 10 Comprehensive Schools in the UK&#x27; for both 2022 and 2023.

==Overview==
The London Oratory School admits 160 boys to the first form, as well as twenty boys who join the senior school from the Junior House. The School educates boys aged 7–16 and boys and girls aged 16–18 in the sixth form. There are around 1,350 pupils including about 350 in the sixth form.

The School shares its religious and cultural identity with the Congregation of the Oratory who founded the School and are its trustees. The school&#x27;s formal links with the Brompton Oratory go back to the foundation of the school by The Congregation of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri (London) and continue as the Fathers of this Congregation are the trustees of the School. The London Oratory School and The Brompton Oratory continue their close working relationship which includes the Oratory Fathers supplying chaplaincy to the School and the School supplying the Schola choir for the parish.

The school is notable for educating the children of a number of prominent politicians, including the children of the former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, children of Harriet Harman and former deputy Prime Minister, Sir Nick Clegg.

==History==
The Fathers of the London Oratory in Brompton, near South Kensington, opened their first school in King William Street in the City of London in 1852 and two parochial schools in Chelsea in 1856. Seven years later, in 1863, at the request of Cardinal Wiseman, who wanted to provide a wider education for Catholic children than was available at that time, the Oratory Fathers established a school for boys in Chelsea, and in 1870 a school for girls staffed by the Daughters of the Cross. These schools were fee paying and they were the forerunners of the present school.
Both schools flourished but in the early part of the last century Cardinal Vaughan asked the Oratory Fathers to inaugurate the first Central Schools for Catholic children. This they did in 1912, developing the two schools which ceased to be fee paying, into Central Schools on a site in Stewart&#x27;s Grove, Chelsea.

During both World Wars, sixty six &#x27;Old Oratorians&#x27; lost their lives fighting for their country, with some of the men having been members of the Oratory Cadet Corps. The vast majority of Oratory boys joined the Army or RAF, but a select few did join the Royal Navy. Old Oratorians were recipients of decorations, such as the Croix de Guerre, the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Cross. On the outbreak of war in 1939, the school, together with Fr Dale-Roberts of the Oratory, moved to Tonypandy in South Wales, whilst the school site in Stewart Grove was taken over by the War Office and used as a high status internment camp.

In 1959 the two central schools were amalgamated and in 1962 it was decided that the Daughters of the Cross were to be withdrawn after almost a century of devoted work. In 1963 the school was classed as a four-form entry grammar school admitting only boys since there were already many more selective places for girls than boys in the schools in the Westminster diocese. However, those girls currently at the school were, on the insistence of the newly appointed headmaster - who had applied for and been appointed head of a mixed school - allowed to remain at the school to complete their education. 
The school moved to its present site in Fulham in 1970, now with six forms of entry (180) at 11+, with girls being admitted annually to the sixth form.
In September 1989 the school, formerly a voluntary-aided school, became a grant-maintained school, continuing in the trusteeship of the Fathers of the London Oratory, who own the building and grounds and appoint the majority of the governors.
The Junior House, occupying a newly built block adjacent to the Arts Centre, was opened in September 1996, to which 20 seven-year-old boys are admitted for a specialist music education, with a strong emphasis on Catholic liturgical music.
Under the Academies Act 2010, the school became an Academy in August 2011.

The school marked its 150th anniversary on 27 September 2013 with the celebration of Mass in Westminster Cathedral.

On 27 December 2023 at around 10am, a blaze erupted in one of the school buildings. The emergency services were quickly on the scene and the fire was brought under control, with no casualties reported. A sixteen year old youth was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of arson.

==Houses==

The school&#x27;s houses are named after notable Catholic Tyburn Martyrs.
==Junior House==
Twenty seven-year-old boys are admitted to the Junior House for a specialist musical education, including instrumental tuition. Some of the boys are admitted as choristers and sing in The Schola at from age 7. Boys admitted to the Junior House are full members of the school and are expected to continue their education at the school for the remainder of their Secondary Education. This is up until the age of sixteen.

Pupils are selected on the basis of their musical aptitude and are required to take part in musical and, in the case of choristers, choral activities arranged outside normal school hours, including weekends and holidays, and to learn at least two musical instruments.

==London Oratory School Schola==


The Oratory in London is part of a liturgical and musical tradition which goes back to the 16th century when the first Oratory was established in Rome at the time of the Counter-Reformation. Both Palestrina and Victoria - the latter joining the Congregation - were closely associated with the Oratory and St Philip Neri, its founder. The Oratory in Europe has been closely associated with the development of polyphony and the chant. The Oratory in London together with the school have gained a reputation for maintaining the rich tradition of liturgical music in England and Europe.

Choristers normally join the school at the age of seven and are selected by audition, examination and interview, although places may sometimes be available to boys who join the school at a later stage. The Choristers rehearse before lessons every morning, as well as for an hour immediately before services, and frequently during the lunch break and after school. They receive voice training from one of London&#x27;s vocal coaches and all boys are given individual voice lessons. When their voices change, they devote more time to instrumental music. Their interest in singing is kept alive until their voices have developed sufficiently to enable them, where appropriate, to return to the Schola as Choral Scholars, when they benefit from the opportunity of singing alongside professional lay clerks from the Oratory Church Choir. Choristers are involved in other aspects of the musical life of the school.

The Schola sings at the Saturday evening Mass at the Oratory every week in term time and at other Masses and services during and outside term, and in the School Chapel during the week. In addition to the liturgical commitment, the choir engages in concert work and touring and has recorded film soundtracks and audio albums. The choir is most famous for its contribution to the double-platinum award-winning soundtrack to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. Each of these three soundtracks won a Grammy Award For Best Score. The choir also works extensively for charity, helping raise funds for various charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, Save the Children and the Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program.

==Sport==
===Rugby===
The traditional sport of the school is rugby and the London Oratory is commonly seen as a &#x27;rugby school&#x27;. The school has won 58 Middlesex county championships to date, most recently in the 2021/22 season. Furthermore, a sizeable number of Oratorians have gone on to represent England at international level, both at junior and senior levels. At non-international level, several Oratorians have played in The Varsity Match, with two old boys playing for the Cambridge XV in 2007. All teams in the school compete in their respective leagues, including the Daily Mail Cup, which the U15 XV making it to the final in 1992. In the first form, rugby is compulsory. The majority of the 180 boys turn out to play most Saturdays for fixtures against other schools. By the VI form, the number of boys is reduced to a 1st and 2nd XV. Both the 1st and 2nd XV play a full calendar of matches over the course of the season, against fellow schools in the South East, including The Oratory School, Dulwich, St. Paul&#x27;s, Wimbledon College, Eton, Berkhamsted and Harrow, as well as a number of schools from further afield. The first overseas rugby tour was to Galway, Ireland in 1971, winning all matches, which was followed in 1979 by a US tour to New York, Philadelphia and Washington DC. Tours continued to San Francisco in 1983, Canada in 1988 and Australia in 1990, winning two out of seven matches in the latter. The 1st XV and 2nd XV toured Australia in July 2011, including one game in Singapore, the first major tour for 21 years.
The school organises its own U12/U15 Sevens Tournament and also organises a national sevens competition at U16 level, which is held at London Irish. Rugby is played at the school&#x27;s sports grounds at Barn Elms on the banks of the River Thames. Previous sports grounds used by the school include Hampstead Heath and the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters. The house rugby competition also takes place in the Michaelmas term.

===Cricket===
Cricket at the Oratory tended to be more of a focus prior to the Second World War, with less success in the immediate post-war period. By the 1980s however, the fortunes of the school teams were improving and the U12 XI beat Latymer Upper School in the 1987 London Cup final. There are 4 cricket nets in the school grounds which are used for after school practice during the summer months. The school&#x27;s cricket teams host matches at Barn Elms and play in a few county cups and leagues, for example the Middlesex Schools&#x27; Cup. Cricket is also the main sport in the Junior House.

===Other sports===
The school has a 17.5-meter, indoor swimming pool in its grounds. The School holds the Junior House swimming gala in the pool, as well as regular games lessons and waterpolo practice. The first annual swimming gala took place in 1882 and for many decades took place at the Chelsea Baths. Teams for the gala in recent decades has been organised by the housemasters.

There are no football teams at present who represent the school, however football had been the main sport of the school up until the 1960s and to this day each form from each house puts forward a team for the annual house football competition.

Rowing at the Oratory expanded somewhat in the mid 1960s and by 1965 there were enough boys for a decent eight. In 1980, Allan Whitwell joined the school staff and built up the rowing squad, which included boys who were already rowing at other clubs. Rowing disappeared for around a decade before being reorganised towards the end of the 1990s when the London Oratory School Boat Club acquired its first boat. By 2006, LOSBC had its first Schools&#x27; Head win in a coxed four. In 2012, the school won its first gold medal at the National Schools&#x27; Regatta, which was followed by the 1st VIII winning the 2016 Child Beale trophy, and qualifying for Henley Royal Regatta in 2015 and 2016. The boat club rowed out of Barn Elms for much of its existence, with a period at Putney Town Rowing Club, before moving to the Chiswick Boathouse next to Barnes Bridge in 2011. The boat club is now somewhat external to the school, managed by London Youth Rowing and races as The 1863 Club.

The London Oratory School Fencing Club was recently founded. Other sports offered by the school include volleyball, Gaelic football, tennis, netball, table tennis, hockey, angling, boxing and athletics, as well as lacrosse, skiing, sub-aqua, golf, basketball and horse riding being offered in the past. As well as the pool, the school has a newly renovated gym, which contains weights apparatus, bikes, treadmills and ergos.

==The Patronal Festival==

The tradition of marking St Philip&#x27;s feast day began in 1936. The School celebrates its patronal festival with a Pontifical High Mass in Brompton Oratory on the feast of Saint Philip Neri, 26 May, or on the nearest Friday that falls during Trinity term. The Mass is followed immediately by the distribution of prizes to award winners and the presentation of ties and badges of office to the Senior Prefects by the outgoing Head of School. The official handing over of duties from the outgoing Senior Prefects to the incoming prefects occurs when the badges and ties of office are issued. All members of Staff traditionally wear full academic dress on this occasion.

The Principal Celebrant is usually a high-ranking official of the Catholic Church. Recent Celebrants have included:
* Cardinal Burke, The prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura (2013)
* The Right Reverend Bishop Alan Hopes, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster (2012)
* The Reverend Paul Keane, Old Oratorian and Chaplain to the University of Essex (2011)
* The Very Reverend Richard Duffield, Provost of the Birmingham Oratory (2010)
* The Very Reverend Robert Byrne, Provost of the Oxford Oratory (2009)
* The Right Reverend Patrick O&#x27;Donoghue, Bishop Emeritus of Lancaster (2008) 
* Dom Aidan Bellenger, Abbot of Downside (2007) 
* Archbishop Maurice Couve de Murville, Archbishop Emeritus of Birmingham (2006) 
* The Right Reverend Dom Cuthbert Brogan, Abbot of Farnborough (2005) 
* The Right Reverend Bishop Alan Hopes, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster (2004) 
* Bishop George Stack, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster (2003) 
* Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, Archbishop of Westminster (2002) 
* Bishop Arthur Roche, Bishop of Leeds (2001) 
* Bishop Victor Guazzelli, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster (2000) 
* The Abbot of Ampleforth (1999) 
* The Catholic Chaplain to Harrow School (1998) 
* The Provost of the London Oratory (1997)
* The Apostolic Nuncio (1996)
* Cardinal Basil Hume (1995)
* Dom Stanislaus Hobbs of St Benedict&#x27;s Abbey, Ealing (1994)
* The Master of St Benet&#x27;s Hall, Oxford (1993)
* The Provost of the Oxford Oratory (1992). 

Traditionally the Principal Celebrant preaches on the life of Saint Philip, with concluding comments directed to those pupils leaving the school.

The Guard of Honour is a tradition used by The London Oratory School for the Principal Celebrant of the Mass and senior guests. It is customary for the Combined Cadet Force, consisting of the Army and RAF divisions to mount the Guard of Honour before the Mass as the Principal Celebrant enters the Brompton Oratory. The London Oratory School CCF has been badged to the Irish Guards since 2010. Previously the Army Section wore the cap badge of the Royal Green Jackets. Major General W G Cubitt, CBE, Major General Commanding the Household Division and General Officer Commanding London District was the Reviewing Officer at the CCF Biennial Inspection and oversaw the re-badging, together with the regimental adjutant and staff from regimental headquarters, making the London Oratory CCF the only Combined Cadet Force badged to the Irish Guards and one of the few CCFs badged to a Household Division regiment.

Music at the Mass is provided by The Schola Cantorum and Chamber Choir assisted by The London Oratory Sinfonia. Organists for the ceremony have included David Terry, Nicholas O&#x27;Neill, Steven Grahl and Jeremy Filsell.

Awards are made both for curricular and extra-curricular aspects of school life. The conclusion of the patronal festival is traditionally marked with the school and congregation singing the school Song, &quot;Quam bonum est&quot;. After Mass there is a reception for the Guests, Senior Prefects, award winners and their parents in Saint Wilfrid&#x27;s Hall, which is adjacent to the Brompton Oratory.

==The John McIntosh Arts Centre==
The Arts Centre which was inaugurated in 1991 by the then Prime Minister John Major, has a 305-seat theatre, with fly-tower, dressing rooms and orchestra pit, art studios and gallery space, a pottery, music teaching rooms, music technology suites, small recording studio, a recital area, practice rooms and four classrooms dedicated to each of the Junior House classes. In the foyer there is a large bronze sculpture of Athena by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi and major series of his original prints. In December 2006 the Arts Centre was renamed the John McIntosh Arts Centre in honour of the recently retired headmaster.

Throughout the year there is a varied programme of concerts, recitals, plays, and exhibitions by pupils, parents and visiting artists and performers. In previous years the school has presented &quot;Macbeth, Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, The Comedy of Errors, Much Ado about Nothing, &quot;and&quot; The Tempest, &quot;Molière&#x27;s&quot; Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme &quot;and&quot; The Hypochondriac, &quot;Gogol&#x27;s&quot; The Government Inspector, &quot;Shaw&#x27;s&quot; The Devil&#x27;s Disciple &quot;and&quot; Pygmalion, &quot;Beckett&#x27;s&quot; Endgame, &quot;Edward Bond&#x27;s&quot; The Sea and Stone, Toad of Toad Hall, The Elephant Man, &quot;a number of one act plays including four by Chekhov, Arthur Miller&#x27;s&quot; The Crucible &quot;and&quot; A View from the Bridge, &quot;Oscar Wilde&#x27;s&quot; The Importance of Being Earnest, &quot;Peter Shaffer&#x27;s&quot; Black Comedy, &quot;Noël Coward&#x27;s&quot; Blithe Spirit, &quot;Alan Bennett&#x27;s&quot; Habeas Corpus, &quot;and a production of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s&quot; Alice in Wonderland.&quot; The sixth form usually put on two productions a year, with a play in the Michaelmas term and a musical in the Lent term.

==Controversies==
===Sexual abuse allegations===
In 2000, Father David Martin was accused of sexually abusing pupils through letters from anonymous students at the school. David Martin, who died in September 1998 of HIV related illnesses had been acting chaplain at the Oratory School from 1997 to 1998. Childline confirmed that they had been contacted by young people making allegations of abuse at the school. Claims about his conduct were also detailed in letters to Hammersmith and Fulham social services, the Archbishop of Westminster and to national newspapers in late October 2000.
Hammersmith and Fulham council considered there to be “no evidence with which to base any further investigations, because the letter was anonymous, there was no specific allegation of child abuse, and obviously Father Martin was dead.” A spokesman for the Westminster diocese said: “Naturally the church is deeply concerned whenever any allegations are made against a priest and especially if there are any victims of abuse. Any allegations need to be fully investigated and the church authorities will cooperate fully.” Father Ignatius Harrison, main chaplain at the Oratory School was fully aware of the investigation, stating that there had never been any concerns about Father Martin&#x27;s behaviour.
Hammersmith and Fulham social services, with the police, launched an investigation, which stalled due to the unclear lines of responsibility - Father Martin was chaplain at the school for four terms but was employed not by them but by the Oratory Fathers. Child protection officers attempted to establish the identity of the boy who made the complaints, only having his first name. There have been no further updates since December 2000.

<text>In role-playing games, a status effect is a temporary modification to a game character’s original set of stats that usually comes into play when special powers and abilities (such as spells) are used, often during combat. It appears in numerous computer and video games of many genres, most commonly in role-playing video games. The term &quot;status effect&quot; can be applied both to changes that provide a character an advantage (increased attributes, defensive barriers, regeneration), and those that hinder the character (decreased attributes, incapacitation, degeneration). Especially in MMORPGs, beneficial effects are referred to as buffs, and hindering effects are called debuffs.

==Acquiring and removing status effects==
A status effect in the abstract is a persistent consequence of a certain in-game event or action, and as such innumerable variants exist across the gaming field. Status effects may result from one character performing a certain type of attack on another. Players may acquire status effects by consuming items, casting spells on themselves or each other, activating devices in the world, interacting with NPCs, or remaining in a particular location. Meeting certain criteria may result in the character acquiring a condition, which can have a status effect associated with it; for example: if their hunger level is high they may acquire a &#x27;starving&#x27; condition, which produces a status effect that reduces their health regeneration. Some games offer permanent status effects which persist for an entire level and act as modifications to the game&#x27;s native difficulty. 

The process of removing a status effect varies. Some status effects expire after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Most games contain items capable of healing specific status effects, or rarer items which can heal all of them. Many games also include magic spells that can eliminate status effects. Status effects are often removed at the end of a battle or once the originating enemy is defeated, however some may persist until they are explicitly cured. Games which allow players to rest may remove some status effects when that action is taken. If a game has multiple classes, one will often be a class capable of healing, who will have a greater ability to remove negative status effects than other classes.

In addition, many games have weapons, armor, or other equipment that can mitigate status effects or prevent a character from getting one in the first place. Depending on the game, some increase the chance to escape suffering the effect each time the player may potentially receive it, while others grant complete immunity. However, sometimes the equipment that is resisting an effect, will in exchange, as a penalty, increase vulnerability against a different effect, offering the player the opportunity to make tactical choices.

==Buffs and debuffs==
In many MMORPGs, the terms buff and debuff are commonly used to describe status effects. Some spells or powers may debuff an enemy while buffing an ally at the same time.
&quot;Buff&quot; is the term generically used to describe a positive status effect that affects mainly player or enemy statistics (usually cast as a spell). &quot;Debuffs&quot; are effects that may negatively impact a player character or a non-player character in some way other than reducing their hit points. Some examples of buffs and debuffs are:
There are countless other debuffs, depending on the game played, though all share the same concept: to make a certain target less powerful in one or more aspects. Both buffs and debuffs are generally of a temporary nature, wearing off after a certain period of time.

==Auras==
Many modern real-time strategy games have hero units, single units that are powerful, but limited in number (usually only one of a single type allowed). In addition to their normally very high stats, many heroes also have auras which confer beneficial status effects or attribute bonuses to any friendly units that enter within a certain radius of the hero. This makes the hero unit an important factor in an engagement as, in addition to their formidable combat skills and powerful abilities, they also make the units around them more effective.

Some heroes and spellcaster units can also confer or inflict buffs, debuffs, and other status effects to units as spells.

<text>Vahid Halilhodžić (; born 15 May 1952) is a Bosnian professional football manager and former player. He is regarded as one of the most controversially successful Bosnian football managers, due to his successful tenure in coaching various national teams yet having problematic relations with his teams and players due to different approaches.

Regarded as one of the best Yugoslav players, Halilhodžić had successful playing spells with Velež Mostar and French clubs Nantes and Paris Saint-Germain before retiring in 1987. During that time, he earned 15 full international caps for Yugoslavia and was part of national squads who won the 1978 European Under-21 Championship and played at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He was top scorer of the French league in 1983 and 1985.

In the early 1990s, Halilhodžić turned to coaching and, after a short stint as a sporting director at Velež, permanently moved to France in 1993 after fleeing war-torn Bosnia with his family. Since then, he managed a number of teams in French-speaking countries and his achievements include winning the 1997 CAF Champions League with Moroccan side Raja Casablanca, leading French side Lille from second level to third place in Ligue 1 in less than three years, winning the 2003–04 Coupe de France with Paris Saint-Germain, and winning the Croatian league in 2011 with Dinamo Zagreb.

Halilhodžić also qualified for the 2010 World Cup with Ivory Coast (although he was sacked only months before the final tournament) and the 2014 World Cup with Algeria, with whom he reached the round of 16, Algeria&#x27;s best result in history. Later, he qualified for the 2018 World Cup with Japan, but again was fired just prior to the tournament. After a short stint with Nantes in 2018, where he helped avoid relegation to Ligue 2, Halilhodžić became head coach of the Morocco national team, whom he qualified for the 2022 World Cup. Like with Ivory Coast and Japan, he was also sacked by Royal Moroccan Football Federation on August 11, 2022, after Morocco&#x27;s poor performance at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and his fallout with star player Hakim Ziyech.

==Playing career==
===Early life and Velež===
Born in Jablanica, Halilhodžić started playing football in his early teens at local minnows Turbina Jablanica, as the club&#x27;s ground was located some 100 metres from his family home. According to his admission, he did not consider becoming a professional footballer at the time and instead chose to continue his formal education, moving to the nearby city of Mostar at age 14 to study at the local electrotechnical high school, without ever appearing for Turbina in an official match. Nevertheless, it was in Mostar that he first started taking football seriously as he went on to join Yugoslav First League side Velež Mostar academy at age 16, in part on the insistence of his brother Salem, who at the time played for the club as a striker. Halilhodžić then went on to play there at youth levels for the next two and a half years, and, upon signing a professional contract with the club, was sent on a six-month loan to second-level side Neretva Metković to gain some experience.

Upon his return from loan, he quickly broke into the first-team squad in the 1972–73 season, forming a successful attacking partnership with Dušan Bajević and helping Velež finish the season as league runners-up behind Red Star Belgrade. Halilhodžić then went on to become one of the club&#x27;s key players throughout the 1970s, appearing in a total of 376 matches and scoring 253 goals for the club (including 207 appearances and 103 goals in the Yugoslav First League) before leaving the country in September 1981 to join French side Nantes. Earlier that year, he was instrumental in winning the club&#x27;s first major silverware, scoring two goals in their 3–2 Yugoslav Cup final win against Željezničar.

===Nantes and PSG===
At Nantes, he struggled in his first year although he quickly became a first-team regular, scoring 7 goals in 28 appearances in the 1981–82 season. He also got sent off in the first round of the UEFA Cup vs. Lokeren and received a 4 matches suspension from UEFA. The following season, he helped Nantes win their sixth French championship title and was the league&#x27;s top scorer with 27 goals in 36 appearances. Halilhodžić went on to spend five years at La Beaujoire, appearing in a total of 163 league matches and scoring 92 goals for the club, also becoming league top scorer in the 1984–85 season with 28 goals.

In 1986, Halilhodžić decided to return to Mostar so he could spend more time with his father, who in the meantime fell seriously ill. While negotiating a new contract with Nantes, he intentionally asked for a salary bigger than anything the club could afford so that he could be released and return home. However, Francis Borelli, chairman of Paris Saint-Germain, stepped in and made him a &quot;fantastic offer&quot; to sign a one-year contract, with the intention of bringing Halilhodžić to Parc des Princes in order to strengthen the team for their upcoming 1986–87 European Cup campaign.

Halilhodžić accepted the offer and went on to appear for the club in the first 18 games of the 1986–87 season, scoring eight goals. However, his mother back home died during the season, and it was then that Halilhodžić decided to finally retire from active football.

==International career==
Halilhodžić was capped 15 times for the Yugoslavia national team, scoring eight goals. After debuting as a full international in June 1976, he also appeared in a few matches for Yugoslavia under-21 team in 1978, helping them win the 1978 European Under-21 Championship where he claimed the Golden Player award for the best player in the tournament. Halilhodžić, who was 26 at the time, took advantage of the rule that allowed two players over the age of 21 to participate – hence him and Velimir Zajec (who had also already debuted for Yugoslavia full squad in 1977) were the two senior players brought in to strengthen the under-21 squad.

Spanning nine years, Halilhodžić&#x27;s time with the national team was marked by frequently alternating ups and downs, periods of automatic inclusion followed by years-long omissions and frustrating substitute stints.

He made his debut as a substitute at UEFA Euro 1976 under head coach Biće Mladinić during the third place match versus Holland that Yugoslavia lost 2–3 at Zagreb&#x27;s Maksimir Stadium. The 23-year-old Halilhodžić came on for Slaviša Žungul.

Over the next couple of years, he recorded two more substitute appearances – first in September 1976 in a friendly against Italy in Rome and in November 1977 at home against Spain (the infamously violent qualifying home loss at Belgrade&#x27;s Marakana that ended Yugoslavia&#x27;s chances of going to the 1978 World Cup).

===Euro 80 qualifying===
It was not until October 1978 that now 26-year-old Halilhodžić (riding high from his under-21 European championship win) got his first national team start – the opening Euro 80 qualifying clash versus Spain at home in Maksimir. With his first inclusion in the starting lineup by returning coach Mladinić also came his first goal – Yugoslavia was down 0–2 in the first half when Halilhodžić pulled one back in the 44th minute for 1–2, which ended up being the final score as Yugoslavia again lost at home to Spain. With his performance versus Spain, Halilhodžić&#x27;s stock was somewhat raised and as a result he got to start the next qualifier away at Romania that Yugoslavia also lost, this time 2–3. The second consecutive qualifier loss prompted the end of Biće Mladinić&#x27;s time as head coach – he got replaced by interim coach Dražan Jerković. Halilhodžić played the next friendly match under Jerković, scoring a hat-trick against Greece.

The resumption of Euro 1980 qualifying five months later in April 1979 saw the return of Miljan Miljanić to the Yugoslav bench as the FA&#x27;s permanent solution at the head coaching position. Miljanić made major changes to the team he inherited from Mladinić with Halilhodžić one of the many casualties. The changes worked as Yugoslavia won its remaining four qualifiers (including a win away at Spain) as well as its two friendlies versus Italy and Argentina (none of the six matches featured Halilhodžić), but the opening two losses still proved too much to overcome as &quot;Plavi&quot; finished a point behind Spain in the group and did not progress to Euro 1980.

===1982 World Cup===
Halilhodžić made two substitute appearances at the 1982 World Cup: playing the last 15 minutes of the controversial group match versus Spain as well as the entire second half against Honduras. For the position of forward at the tournament, Miljanić preferred Safet Sušić, and in his later interviews, Halilhodžić often expressed dismay and disappointment with head coach Miljanić for not giving him a more prominent role in the Yugoslav team at the 1982 World Cup.

On multiple occasions in the 2000s and 2010s, looking back on his playing days, retired-from-playing-football Halilhodžić expressed bitterness over not getting a bigger part in the national team during the 1970s and 1980s, sarcastically citing his surname being &quot;too long for Belgrade scoreboards&quot; as the reason, thus insinuating that discrimination against Muslims was behind his lack of playing time in the Yugoslavia national team. In a 2023 interview, Halilhodžić claimed that Yugoslav politics had a strong influence on the country&#x27;s 1982 World Cup squad selection, adding non-specifically that &quot;certain players had to make that team&quot; and that &quot;Hajduk Split and Red Star Belgrade players were privileged&quot; over those from comparatively smaller sides.

==Managerial career==
===Raja Casablanca===
In July 1997, he signed with Moroccan side Raja Casablanca. In his first season with the club, he won the 1997 CAF Champions League in December 1997, and the 1997–98 Moroccan Championship in May 1998. These successes raised his international profile.

===Lille===
In October 1998, he returned to France to coach Lille, which at the time was struggling to survive in the French Division 2. His first season at the club ended with Lille finishing fourth, missing a promotion spot on goal difference. In the 1999–2000 season, Halilhodžić&#x27;s club dominated the competition and finished top of table, 16 points clear of second-placed Guingamp, earning promotion to the French Ligue 1.

Lille&#x27;s strong performances on the pitch continued the following season, and they finished third in the 2000–01 French Division 1, only seven points behind champions Nantes, thus qualifying for the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League for the first time in club&#x27;s history. The following season, after knocking out Parma in qualifying, Lille finished third in group stage behind Deportivo de La Coruña and Manchester United, progressing to the 2001–02 UEFA Cup where they reached the Round of 16 before being knocked out by Borussia Dortmund on away goals.

===Rennes===
On 14 October 2002, he was hired by another Ligue 1 club, Rennes, to save them from relegation after the club had picked up only eight points in the opening ten matches of the season under Philippe Bergeroo. Halilhodžić then managed to take the club to a 15th-place finish in the 20-club league, avoiding relegation zone by two points. After his successes with Lille and Rennes, he started to become one of the most sought after coaches in Europe, and whilst receiving offers from several German and Spanish clubs, he joined Paris Saint-Germain in June 2003.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
During his first season at the helm of PSG, the club experienced one of the greatest and unexpectedly successful seasons in its history by winning the 2003–04 Coupe de France and arriving second in the 2003–04 Ligue 1, just three points behind Lyon, qualifying for the 2004–05 Champions League.

Halilhodžić&#x27;s second season at the club, however, was not a success. From their opening Champions League group stage 0–3 home loss versus Chelsea, to their French league struggles, PSG never succeeded in replicating the winning form of the previous season. Going into the final round of Champions League group stage fixtures in December 2004, Halilhodžić&#x27;s team still had a chance of advancing as beating CSKA Moscow at home would have seen PSG move on to the knockout stage. Even just a draw combined with group leaders Chelsea winning or drawing away at Porto would have ensured progress while a draw regardless of the other match outcome guaranteed at least a spot in the UEFA Cup round of 32. The club, however, suffered a disappointing 1–3 defeat at its home stadium, courtesy of a Sergei Semak hat-trick, which meant straight elimination from Europe. It was a bitter loss that even prompted club president Francis Graille to publicly relay his disappointment at the &quot;lack of pride&quot; shown by the squad, though remaining guardedly coy when explicitly asked about Halilhodžić&#x27;s future at the club.

Now with only domestic competition to worry about, PSG began the calendar year 2005 looking to improve its league standing. Sluggish form continued, however, and on 8 February 2005, following a 0–2 defeat at home versus Lens that saw PSG drop to 12th spot in the 2004–05 Ligue 1 table, the club&#x27;s management decided to sack Halilhodžić. He was replaced by the coach of the reserves team, Laurent Fournier, under whom the club was knocked out of 2004–05 Coupe de France by Auxerre in March and eventually finished ninth in the league.

===Trabzonspor===
On 2 October 2005, Halilhodžić was signed by Turkish Süper Lig side Trabzonspor. Although he led the club to fourth place in the 2005–06 Süper Lig, just behind Istanbul&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot;, thus qualifying for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, Halilhodžić decided to leave Turkey in June 2006 after just one season with the club.

===Ivory Coast===
In May 2008, Halilhodžić was hired to train the Ivory Coast national team, captained by Didier Drogba and including the likes of Yaya and Kolo Touré, Salomon Kalou, Emmanuel Eboué and the young Gervinho. In a two-year unbeaten run in African qualifiers, the team qualified for both the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Angola and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. In January 2010 in the quarter-finals of the continental championship against Algeria, however, the Ivory Coast were eliminated after Madjid Bougherra scored a 2–2 equaliser in injury time, with Hamer Bouazza adding Algeria&#x27;s third goal in the opening minutes of extra time.

The defeat came as a huge disappointment for many Ivorians, for whom the national football team played a central social role and a source of national pride and unity, especially as the country was recovering from the 2002–07 civil war and preparing for its first post-war elections in October that year. As a consequence, Halilhodžić was fired on 27 February 2010, less than four months before the 2010 World Cup finals tournament in South Africa.

===Dinamo Zagreb===
Back in Europe, Halilhodžić was announced as the new manager of Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb on 16 August 2010, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract and replacing club legend Velimir Zajec who had been fired after the team was knocked out of the Champions League qualifying on penalties by the Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol. Although eliminated from the Champions League, Dinamo had the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League to compete in, and Halilhodžić was tasked with guiding Dinamo&#x27;s European campaign while expected to continue their dominance in the national championship.

Club fans immediately took to Halilhodžić, as Dinamo started playing an attractive and more attacking style of football. On 16 September 2010, exactly one month after signing his contract, he led Dinamo to a somewhat improbable 2–0 victory over Spanish side Villarreal at the start of the Europa League group stage. Despite some encouraging results early in the season, Dinamo eventually failed to progress past the group stage, losing the deciding match in December 2010 at home against Greek club PAOK. Despite the setback, Halilhodžić stayed on due to support of both the fans and club management.

In the 2010–11 Croatian First League, the club was a runaway leader without any real competition, managing to clinch the domestic league title months prior to season&#x27;s end. Simultaneously, issues arose over the renegotiation of terms of Halilhodžić&#x27;s contract and, on 6 May 2011 two matches short of the end of the season, he abruptly left the club following a vicious shouting incident with Dinamo&#x27;s president Zdravko Mamić in the team dressing room at Maksimir during half-time of the league match versus Inter Zaprešić.

===Algeria===
On 22 June 2011, the Algerian Football Federation announced that Halilhodžić would take over the vacant Algeria national team manager position starting on 1 July. On 2 July, the deal was made official with Halilhodžić signing a three-year contract. He successfully led Algeria through the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification and in preparation for the finals tournament to be held in January 2013 in South Africa, the team invited Bosnia and Herzegovina (Halilhodžić&#x27;s country of birth) for a friendly match in November 2012. Algeria lost 0–1 in injury time on a rainy night in Algiers.

Despite arriving at the final tournament with plenty of confidence and with the emergence of young stars Islam Slimani and El Arbi Hillel Soudani, as well as the addition to the squad of talented Valencia winger Sofiane Feghouli, Algeria finished bottom of their group, losing their opening two matches to Tunisia and Togo without scoring a single goal. Although the result was widely regarded as a disappointment, the Algerian Football Federation decided to keep Halilhodžić in charge and allow the team to gain more experience.

Now focusing on the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Algeria under Halilhodžić secured a spot at the finals tournament on 19 November 2013 having beaten the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations runners-up Burkina Faso in a two-legged tie on away goals rule following a 3–3 aggregate score in the African qualifying play-offs. This was only the fourth time the country qualified for a World Cup in 32 years.

Algeria&#x27;s performance at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was a significant surprise as they beat South Korea 4–2 and drew with Russia 1–1 to progress past the group stage for the first time in the team&#x27;s history. In the round of 16, &quot;Les Fennecs&quot; had to face a very strong Germany side. Although Algeria put up a very spirited resistance, they lost the game after a goalless 90 minutes, followed by extra time in which Germany scored twice through André Schürrle and Mesut Özil, with substitute Abdelmoumene Djabou pulling back one in the dying moments of the game to make it 1–2. Germany later went on to deliver a historic 7–1 thrashing of hosts Brazil and win their fourth World Cup title.

Despite the exit, Algeria&#x27;s performance was the team&#x27;s biggest success in history and Halilhodžić was frequently praised for his strategic counter-attacking tactics, calm yet motivating influence on the players, and skillful game management. Although he was offered a contract extension after the tournament, on 7 July 2014 he left the team.

===Japan===
On 7 March 2015, in the wake of Halilhodžić being shortlisted for and eventually—following two November 2014 meetings with the Bosnian Football Association (FSBiH) representatives—rejecting the Bosnia and Herzegovina manager job offer, press reports appeared about Halilhodžić being set to take over as the Japan national team&#x27;s new manager. He was officially appointed on 12 March 2015, thus replacing Javier Aguirre who had been sacked by the Japan Football Association (JFA) over his involvement in a 2011 match-fixing investigation in Spain.

In June 2016, Halilhodžić&#x27;s Japan hosted Bosnia and Herzegovina in a Kirin Cup friendly, losing 1–2. In September 2016, the 2018 World Cup qualifying final round kicked off with six teams including Japan, Saudi Arabia and Australia fighting for two direct qualifying spots. In their opening match, Japan were unexpectedly beaten 1–2 by the UAE, a contest that featured a controversially disallowed Japanese goal. Nevertheless, the Japanese media raised a number of questions regarding Halilhodžić&#x27;s squad selection.

Since then, media criticism of Halilhodžić&#x27;s strategy and squad selection continued, and would follow him throughout his time at the job. He abandoned the decade-long Japanese traditional playing style of short passes, instead, he emphasized intense fighting for the ball (as he called it in French, &quot;duel&quot;) and quick pace football. His most controversial decision was to drop Keisuke Honda (AC Milan), Shinji Kagawa (Dortmund) and Shinji Okazaki (Leicester). Another controversial call was to put Hotaru Yamaguchi, a player in the domestic second division, to his starting lineup.

Finishing the group with 6 wins, 2 draws, 2 losses with 7 conceded goals, Japan&#x27;s performance was inconsistent, yet it secured crucial victories at critical moments to earn itself the top spot. The two critical moments was first, winning 2–1 against Saudi Arabia in November 2016 to end the first half of the group matches in the first place; second, beating Australia 2–0 in August 2017 to secure top spot and qualified to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It is at these two moments the Japanese media temporarily admitted Halilhodžić is right on his strategy and his selection of squad. Yet they were called into questions once again after Japan&#x27;s poor performance in the international friendlies in October and November against Haiti, Brazil and Belgium.

In December, Halilhodžić summoned his second and third team to 2017 East Asian Cup. Half of the team were uncapped. This unconventional inexperienced Japan team lost to South Korea 1–4. The Japanese media saw this as a humiliating defeat. Without realizing the Japan–South Korea football rivalry, Halilhodžić comments &quot;I was amazed by South Korea&#x27;s explosiveness of power, technique and control of the game. South Korea dominated us in every way.&quot; His comments made himself under siege by the Japanese media for weeks. Halilhodžić was dismissed in early April 2018, following friendlies with non-World Cup teams—last minute draw with Mali and 1–2 loss to Ukraine, with former international Akira Nishino named the new head coach. At a news conference, JFA President Kozo Tashima told reporters that poor results and a lack of &quot;communication and trust with the players&quot; were the reasons for Halilhodžić&#x27;s dismissal.

Halilhodžić&#x27;s spiky personality frequently ruffled feathers after arriving in Japan to take over from Javier Aguirre in March 2015, and rumors of his impending dismissal swirled throughout his three-year reign. Soon after Halilhodžić&#x27;s dismissal, Japan&#x27;s midfielder Keisuke Honda, who had had an increasingly fractious relationship with the Bosnian throughout 2017 over the head coach&#x27;s rigid tactics, came out publicly against the fired coach by saying: &quot;To submit myself to the kind of football Halilhodžić played in order to get picked, that would be shameful for me. I&#x27;m proud that I&#x27;ve stayed true to myself&quot;. On 24 May 2018, Halilhodžić launched a lawsuit in a Tokyo district court against the JFA president Kozo Tashima, contending he was dismissed wrongfully—specifically that Tashima failed to consult the JFA board when deciding to fire Halilhodžić.

In July 2018, Halilhodžić made a 4-man shortlist for the vacant Egyptian national team manager job alongside Quique Sánchez Flores, Jorge Luis Pinto, and Javier Aguirre. Aguirre ended up getting hired.

===Nantes===
In October 2018, Halilhodžić became the new manager of FC Nantes, a club he had played for as a striker. His first win came on 22 October when Nantes beat Toulouse 4–0 at the Stade de la Beaujoire.

On 5 May 2019, Nantes beat Dijon at home 3–0 and Halilhodžić made a club record, winning five Ligue 1 matches in a row, a venture which was not done in over 18 years in the club. Halilhodžić&#x27;s Nantes beat Lyon, Paris Saint-Germain, Amiens, Marseille and at the end Dijon to capture that record.

On 2 August 2019, Halilhodžić decided to leave Nantes after disagreements with the club&#x27;s owner and president Waldemar Kita.

===Morocco===
In August 2019, it was confirmed that Halilhodžić would take over as the Morocco national team&#x27;s new manager. His first win came on 10 September when Morocco beat Niger 1–0 at the Stade de Marrakech. On 29 March 2022, Halilhodžić qualified Morocco for the 2022 World Cup, eliminating DR Congo in the CAF Third round qualifiers.

On 11 August 2022, Halilhodžić was officially sacked by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation over disagreements with its president on how the team should move forward. This marked the third time—the other two being Ivory Coast and Japan—Halilhodžić was sacked before a World Cup tournament after prior successful qualification.

==Personal life==
During the Bosnian War in 1992, Halilhodžić was wounded in Mostar but recovered within a few months. He acquired French nationality by naturalization on 13 June 1997.

When visiting Mostar with a France 3 crew in 2001, he said:
On 23 July 2004, during his tenure as the manager of PSG, Halilhodžić received the Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur of the French Republic. Halilhodžić is married and has two children. His primary residence is in Lille, where his family lives.

Vahid described himself as a Yugoslav, and was deeply saddened by the disintegration of Yugoslavia when the war started. He speaks Bosnian and French, the result of spending most of his time in France.

<text>One International Place is a Postmodern skyscraper in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1987, and designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects – whose principals are Philip Johnson and John Burgee – it is tied with Bulfinch Crossing: One Congress as Boston&#x27;s 8th-tallest building, standing 600 feet (183 m) tall and housing 46 floors. The building is very prominent in the city&#x27;s skyline, particularly when viewed from Boston Harbor.

The building has three separate elements. These consist of the tower itself, as well as two smaller components (27- and 19-stories), linked to Two International Place by a central dome with fifty-five-foot rain fountain court and winter garden.

An architectural critic said &quot;the multifaceted towers offend through the dullness of their exterior articulation—particularly the density of Palladian windows, crowned with false arches&quot;. Another critic states that the Palladian windows are &quot;a late 20th-century corporate version of the un-composed vernacular use of a decontextualised architectural element&quot; and complain of their &quot;relentless deployment on this vast building, that bears no relationship to the human form from which the Palladian window derived its scale&quot;.

<doc id="1109003" wikidata="Q679291" url="?curid=1109003" title="Standing long jump">
<text>The standing long jump, also known as the standing broad jump, is an athletics event. It was an Olympic event until 1912. It is one of three standing variants of track and field jumping events, which also include the standing high jump and standing triple jump.

In performing the standing long jump, the jumper stands at a line marked on the ground with the feet slightly apart. The athlete takes off and lands using both feet, swinging the arms and bending the knees to provide forward drive. The jump must be repeated if the athlete falls back or takes a step at take-off.

In the early part of the nineteenth century the standing long jump was a popular event at highland games and military sports, but very few of these performances were measured. On Friday 8 July 1853 the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders held their annual Highland Games on Chobham Common at which Private J. Forbes cleared 9ft 3in (2.82m) in the standing long jump.

John Scriven of Cambridge University also cleared 9ft 3in (2.82m) at the St John&#x27;s College Sports at Fenner&#x27;s cricket ground on Thursday 15 March 1859. Less than a week later, on the first day of the Cambridge University Sports on Monday 21 March, William Howard, of Trinity College, Cambridge, cleared 10ft 2in (3.10m).

At the annual regimental sports of the 24th Regiment, at Shorncliff Camp, near Cheriton in Kent, on Thursday 16 September 1864, three men cleared ten feet. Private Lynch cleared 10ft 6in (3.20m), Private Mullis 10ft 3in (3.12m), and Private Crosey 10ft 1in (3.07m).

Huddersfield Athletic Club held their first Annual Athletics Festival at the Rifle Ground, Trinity Street, Huddersfield, on Saturday 24 June 1865, at which two men, W. N. Haigh and J. W. Rhodes, tied at 10ft 8in (3.25m).

Two months later, on Friday 18 August 1865, at Duns, in the borders of Scotland, around fifteen miles west of Berwick-upon-Tweed, at a meeting of Duns Athletic Club, W. Allen cleared 10ft 9in (3.27m) in the standing long jump and 32ft 2in (9.80m) in the standing triple jump.

Eleven feet was first cleared less than a week later. On Saturday 14 August 1865, Private Rushton (H Troop) cleared exactly 11ft 0in (3.35m) at Aldershot during the Regimental Sports of the 14th Hussars.

Ten months later, on Saturday 24 June 1866, two men cleared eleven feet. At the second Annual Athletic Festival of Huddersfield Athletic Club both M. H. Bradley and J. W. Rhodes cleared 11ft 0in (3.35m) at the Rifle Ground, Trinity Street, 
Huddersfield.

Exactly one year after that, at the third annual festival of Huddersfield Athletic Club on Saturday 13 July 1867, J. Duckworth, of Haslingden Athletic Club, cleared 11ft 3 1/2in (3.44m).

At Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary in southern Ireland, fifteen miles north west of Waterford, on Monday 1 April 1872, Maurice Davin, a farmer who later became the first President of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), cleared 11ft 6in (3.50m). He also won the 56lb weight throw at 26ft 4in (8.02m), the shot put (17lb) with 38ft 8in (11.78m), the hammer (16lb) 98ft 0in (29.88m), the standing triple jump 32ft 7in (9.93m), and had a walkover in the high jump.

On Saturday 13 May 1876, at the Chuckery Ground, Walsall, during the Second Annual Athletic Sports of Walsall Cricket &amp; Football Club, A. B. Lindop jumped 11ft 10in (3.60m).

Ray Ewry set the first world record for the standing long jump at on September 3, 1904. The current unofficial record is held by Byron Jones, who recorded a jump of at the NFL Combine on February 23, 2015, beating the official world-record jump distance of set by Norwegian shot putter Arne Tvervaag from Ringerike FIK Sportclub in 1968, in a different setting with different controls.

France held national championships at standing long jump and standing high jump for men from 1905 to 1920, and for women from 1917 to 1926. Their first standing long jump champions were Henri Jardin (Racing Club de France) 3.04m (9ft 11 3/4in), and Suzanne Liebrard (Fémina Sports) 2.215m (7ft 3in).

When indoor arenas were built, the standing long jump began to disappear as an event. Today, Norway is the only country where the standing long jump is a national championship event. The Norwegian Championships in Standing Jumps (long jump and high jump) has been held in Stange every winter since 1995.

The standing long jump is also one of the events at the NFL combine, it was one of the standardized test events as part of the President&#x27;s Award on Physical Fitness, as well as the physical fitness test that officer cadets must complete at the Royal Military College of Canada and the United States Air Force Academy. In the Brazilian police forces, a minimum performance in a standing long jump test is required to join the Federal Police (2.14 m for men 1.66 m for women) and the Federal Highway Police (2.00 m for men 1.60 m for women).

<text>Young Conservatives Denmark (, abbreviated KU) is the youth wing of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Denmark.

==History==
Founded by Carl F. Herman von Rosen on 8 December 1904, more than a decade before its mother party, KU is the oldest youth political organisation in Denmark and the oldest remaining youth political organisation in the world.

Following its formation, KU grew quickly as an organisation and many local branches throughout Denmark sprung up. Later prominent party members were chairmen of KU in this period, most notably John Christmas Møller, a historic figure in Danish politics, exiled in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, and celebrated as one of the reasons why Denmark was counted among the allied forces after World War II, despite its collaboration with Germany. KU is most famous for three periods of history - the massive growth during the 1930s, the resistance fight during World War II, and the ideological awakening of the 1980s.

===The 1930s===
In the early 1930s KU experienced a major increase in membership and peaked at more than 30,000 members under the leadership of chairman Jack G. Westergaard. KU became somewhat of an institution by being the first non-leftist organization to use &#x27;modern campaign methods&#x27;, such as posters, pamphlets, marches, demonstrations and gatherings. Hosting open-air meetings with thousands of participants, demonstrating in the parks of Copenhagen, and flying over Copenhagen in propeller airplanes with conservative air leaflets became the trademark of the organization. One such incidence, when Copenhagen was plastered with thousands of campaign posters in a single night - is this day commemorated in the official KU song.

Like other youth organisations of the era (like their Swedish counterpart National League of Sweden), KU also took a critical stance towards democracy in the early 1930s, and the ability of democracy to handle the economical and societal crisis that the West was facing. Parts of KU wanted to replace parliamentarism with a corporative system and found symbolic inspiration in fascist Italy and Germany. This reflected itself in the green uniforms and leather straps members of KU wore and the formation of &#x27;Stormtropperne&#x27;, a security patrol designed to protect open-air speakers from violent assaults by socialists. The German Sturmabteilung was the inspiration. This more unfortunate period of KU history is something the organization still struggles with, even though many KU-organisations around the country still own banners from that period, with the local branches in Gentofte and Aarhus being examples of this.

The uniformation, and the formation of a security patrol was also used by the young social democrats and the young communists, but has since been ascribed solely to KU. The uniformation only lasted for 3 days before it was banned by the Danish parliament following a violent incident in which a young social democrat from &#x27;DSU&#x27; killed a young communist in a bar brawl. It has also been insinuated by layman history, most notably in the popular Danish TV-series &#x27;Matador&#x27;, that KU was directly inspired by Nazism and anti-semitism, which, however, was never the case, and has since been rebutted by history.

Following the growth of fascism in Europe, Jack Westergaard and his supporters in KU simultaneously lost momentum in the organisation, and were excluded, as the tides - with later party leader Aksel Møller as new chairman - began to change.

===KU during WWII===
On 9 April 1940 German troops rolled over the Danish border as part of Operation Weserübung, which immediately became the beginning of the infamous and much-debated collaboration between Nazi Germany and the Danish Government. Whilst most of the Danish population did not approve of the collaboration, many saw little reason to fight, or did not begin doing so until after the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was breached in 1941, whereafter communists joined the fight.

KU&#x27;s young conservatives were therefore among the first to pick up any real resistance, viewing the collaboration policy led by the government as national treason committed by the Social Democrats and the Danish Social Liberal Party, the two parties in government which had disarmed Denmark in the preceding years from being the heaviest armed country in Europe to one of the least militarized in the late 1930s.

A young conservative, Arne Sejr, wrote &#x27;Danskerens Regler&#x27; (The Rules of the Dane) on the very day of the invasion, and instigated civil disobedience and sabotage of Nazi rule. As the war went on, thousands of members of KU began committing illegal sabotage, writing illegal papers and employing guerilla tactics. Typically the recruitment of freedom fighters took place in &#x27;terrænsportsforeninger&#x27; (terrain sports clubs) which were legal gymnastics clubs that arranged orienteering, but also functioned as a cover for recruitment and training camps, employing military-like training exercises.
To this day KU&#x27;s legendary &#x27;Konsulentkursus&#x27; (KK) (Consultant Course) exists, which albeit in a moderated form works in a similar way, and each year attracts young conservatives who go through a selection procedure.

Due to the chaotic period, it is unfortunately impossible to state the exact number of casualties, but more than 50 KU members are believed to have given their lives in a fight for the freedom of Denmark - more than any other youth organisation during the resistance. Bjarne Reuter, a popular and much appraised Danish author, has written the bestseller &quot;The Boys from St. Petri&quot; (Drengene fra Skt. Petri), a story of a group of young boys who form a resistance group and repeatedly sabotage and destroy Nazi installations until they are finally caught and sent to a concentration camp. &quot;The Boys from St. Petri&quot; is, in fact, the dramatization of the true story of &#x27;Aalborg KU&#x27;, and their resistance fight.

===KU after the war===
Shortly after the war ended on 5 May 1945, KU experienced a large increase in members again. Two legendary characters in Danish politics, former minister of justice Erik Ninn-Hansen and former prime-minister Poul Schlüter were chairmen during this period.

In the 1960s KU considered changing its name to &#x27;Centrum&#x27;, and the local branch Odense KU even proposed a resolution introducing economic democracy, termed &#x27;ØD&#x27; in Denmark at the given period of time. This is to be seen as a result of the spring of 1968, and the drastic drop in membership as the agenda was now mostly set by the left and the hippie- and peace-movement. Any major changes in politics, however, never happened, and the name, as well as the logo, stuck with KU.

===KUs renaissance in the 1980s===
In the 1980s, as Poul Schlüter became party leader and later prime minister, and inspired by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and the conservative wave sweeping over the Western hemisphere, KU experienced a renaissance in membership. Once again as in the 1930s, KU set the agenda in many areas of the public debate, and members of KU went on to become today&#x27;s leading voices in the political debate on libertarian and economically conservative issues.

Since then KU has gone down in membership, but is now once again experiencing an increase in membership and recently gained 800 members in 3 weeks through its kapitalist.dk campaign. The national congress in 2006 drew more than 250 delegates, something which has not been seen in KU for many years.

===KU today===
At the mother party convention in 2005, after heavy research including an interview with former Estonian prime minister Mart Laar, KU proposed a resolution committing the party to a flat tax system, instead of the current progressive Danish tax system. The resolution which was narrowly defeated, caught enormous attention in the media, and the following day, &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot;, one of the largest papers in the country, praised KU for its audacity and talent and proclaimed that KU was the political future of tomorrow.

The current executive board consists of:

Christian Vigilius (KU i København) (President), Daniel Bennike Bekesi (Gentofte KU) (Vice President) and the board, Benjamin Tvede (KU i Stor-Århus), Oliver Bagge Jensen (Vallensbæk KU), Maria Pryds Frederiksen (Lolland Falster KU), Jacob Feldborg Andersen (KU i Odense) and Cecilie Iwang (Hørsholm KU).

==Honorary and prominent members==
KU has many former members that have since gone into particularly politics, academia and business, and founded successful international companies or become professors or ministers of government.

The Danish freedom institution Libertas was also founded by members of KU.

Many of the founders of CEPOS were current or former members of KU.

In 2004 former Prime Minister Poul Schlüter was awarded the honorary membership of KU for excellence in political leadership and for the distribution of conservatism in Danish politics.

<doc id="1109011" wikidata="Q829688" url="?curid=1109011" title="Alpamayo">
<text>Alpamayo (possibly from Quechua &quot;allpa&quot; earth, &quot;mayu&quot; river, &quot;earth river&quot;) or Shuyturaju (possibly from Ancash Quechua &quot;huytu, shuytu&quot; oblong, slim and long, Quechua &quot;rahu&quot; snow, ice, mountain covered in snow) is one of the most conspicuous peaks in the Cordillera Blanca of the Peruvian Andes. Alpamayo Creek originates northwest of it.

The Alpamayo lies next to the slightly higher Quitaraju.

In July 1966, the German magazine &quot;Alpinismus&quot;, published a photo of Alpamayo taken by American photographer Leigh Ortenburger accompanied by an article on a survey among mountaineering experts, who chose Alpamayo as &quot;The Most Beautiful Mountain in the World&quot;.

== Climbing history and routes ==
Most popular routes start from the village of Caraz, on the north of the Cordillera Blanca. A French-Belgian expedition including George and Claude Kogan claimed to have made the first ascent in 1951. After studying the photos in George Kogan&#x27;s book &quot;The Ascent of Alpamayo&quot;, the German team of G. Hauser, F. Knauss, B. Huhn &amp; H. Wiedmann came to the conclusion that the 1951 team did not reach the actual summit, thereby making their ascent via the north ridge in 1957 the first.

The most common climbing route, known as the Ferrari route, is situated on the southwest face of the mountain. It was opened in 1975 by a group of Italian alpinists led by Casimiro Ferrari. It is considered a difficult climb, demanding good crampon and ice climbing technique. There are incomparable views of steep ice faces, &quot;penitentes&quot;, gigantic white walls and ridges like those of Huandoy Norte, Artesonraju and Huascaran Norte, similar to the finest of the Himalayan scenery. There are also at least six other alternative climbing routes, the second most popular being the Vasque-French route.

<text>Two International Place is a Postmodern skyscraper in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. The site is located on a site formerly known as Fort Hill. It is located blocks from the North End, the waterfront, South Station, Downtown Crossing, and the Federal Courthouse. The building was designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects – whose principals are Philip Johnson and John Burgee – and completed in 1992. It is Boston&#x27;s thirteenth-tallest building, standing 538 feet (164 m) tall.

==Design and features==
===Exterior===
It consists of a 36-story tower and 13-story annex. It is one of the towers in a complex of five structures, anchored by two towers. The facades are constructed of unpolished rose-granite panels with punched aluminum framed and fixed in-place window openings. Windows are a take on tripartite windows but whose lunettes, or arched portions, are fake. A portion of both towers consists of an aluminum framed curtain wall system with a combination of reflective vision glass and spandrel glass. Elaborate classical lighting fixtures are located on exterior. The building&#x27;s crown consists of an octagonal-based pyramid surrounded by a ring rising out of the tower and partially up the pyramid. This crown is illuminated at night.

===Interior===
The Court, located at the center of the complex, features a rain fountain and provides a 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2) retail and café area with restaurants, shops and business services. This court links all the buildings in the complex. Lobby areas feature distinctive imported marble and granite from Spain, Italy and Africa. The interior minimizes columns, greatly enhancing space efficiency and providing work locations with panoramic views. There is secured underground parking with over 800 spaces. There are 38 high-speed passenger elevators and four freight elevators.

<text>The Christian Democratic Youth (), formerly the Youth of the Christian People&#x27;s Party (), is the youth league of the Christian Democrats, a political party in Denmark. Magnus Rothmann is the party&#x27;s chairman since april 2024.

Kristendemokratisk Ungdom (abbreviated KDU) is the political youth organization associated with the Christian Democrats. The association was founded in october 2010 as Young Christian Democrats, after the Christian Democrats had won a seat in the Danish Parliament, and changed to its current name at the general meeting in 2018.

The Christian Democrats had been without a youth organization from 2007-2010, when the former Christian Democratic Youth broke away and became the think tank Cura Ungdom in connection with the election defeat in 2007. Kristian S. Larsen was appointed as chairman at the founding general meeting and re-elected at the general meeting in 2011. Aron Henning was elected chairman at the general meeting in 2012. In 2013, Isabella Arendt Laursen was elected chairman.

In 2016, Isabella Arendt Laursen chose to step down as national chairman, in connection with the national meeting, and then Jacob Hellwing, without opposing candidates, was elected as chairman.

At the general election in 2011, 14 parliamentary candidates from the then Young Christian Democrats were on the list of the Christian Democrats; the party and the candidates were not elected.

In October 2020, Hanna-Maria Smed Molte Lyng was elected as chairman, with no opponents.

In April 2024, Hanna-Maria Smed Molte Lyng resigned as chairman. Magnus Pedersen Rothmann is acting chairman until the upcoming extraordinary national meeting.

<text>Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media is a book allegedly by conservative activist L. Brent Bozell III, criticizing and documenting what Bozell described as the American news media&#x27;s &quot;liberal media bias.&quot;

Bozell argues that the &quot;Liberal Media&quot; will soon collapse on itself, due to their own refusal to admit their perceived faults and bias. As the alleged cycle continues, the possibility for them to recover from previous grievances becomes less likely.

The book may have been ghostwritten by Tim Graham.

<text>The Texaco Cup, officially known as the International League Board Competition, was an association football competition started in 1970, involving sides from England, Scotland, and Ireland that had not qualified for European competitions.

It was one of the first football competitions to receive sponsorship, taking the name of American petroleum company Texaco for £100,000, and was instituted to help promote Texaco&#x27;s recent purchase of the Regent filling station chain. Irish and Northern Irish clubs withdrew from the competition after 1971–72 due to political pressure, competing in a separate Texaco (All-Ireland) Cup in 1973–74 and 1974–75.

Crowds in the competition fell after the first few seasons, and it became the Anglo-Scottish Cup from 1975 to 1976 after Texaco&#x27;s sponsorship ended.

==Format==
For the first four seasons it was played as a straight knockout tournament, with sixteen clubs entered, all ties being two-legged. For the final season of the competition, 16 English clubs played in groups before being joined in the knockout stages by four Scottish sides.

<text>Socialistisk Folkepartis Ungdom (Popular Socialist Youth of Denmark) is the youth wing of the Green Left of Denmark, founded in 1969.

In 1995, the leftist section of the SFU (essentially the Copenhagen branch) broke away and formed Independent Young Socialists (UUS), which evolved into the Socialist Youth Front.

In 2021 SFU consisted of 1,272 members.

In their manifesto they describe themselves as using certain &quot;Marxist tools&quot; in their analysis of the world.

<doc id="1109032" wikidata="Q297026" url="?curid=1109032" title="Kh-55">
<text>The Kh-55 (, also known as RKV-500; NATO reporting name: AS-15 &quot;Kent&quot;) is a Soviet/Russian subsonic air-launched cruise missile, designed by MKB Raduga in the 1970s. It has a range of up to and can carry nuclear warheads. Kh-55 is launched exclusively from bomber aircraft and has spawned a number of conventionally armed variants mainly for tactical use, such as the Kh-65SE and Kh-SD, but only the Kh-555 appears to have been put into service. The Kh-55 was not the basis of the submarine and ground-launched S-10 Granat or RK-55 &quot;Relief&quot; (SS-N-21&quot;Sampson&quot; and SSC-X-4&quot;Slingshot&quot;) designed by NPO Novator. The RK-55 is very similar to the air-launched Kh-55 (AS-15 &quot;Kent&quot;) but the Kh-55 has a drop-down turbofan engine and was designed by MKB Raduga.

==Development==
In the late 1960s, the &quot;Ekho&quot; study conducted by the GosNIIAS institute concluded that it would be more effective to deploy many small, subsonic cruise missiles than the much more expensive supersonic missiles then in favour. Work started at the Raduga bureau on an air-launched cruise missile in 1971, with a first test flight in 1976. The appearance of the US Air Force&#x27;s AGM-86 ALCM in that year gave further impetus to the programme, with the Soviet Air Force issuing a formal requirement for a new air-launched cruise missile in December 1976. The longer-range Kh-55SM was developed a few years after the original went into service.

After the end of the Cold War and anti-proliferation treaties restricting the deployment of long-range nuclear missiles, the Russians made efforts to develop tactical versions of the Kh-55 with conventional warheads. First came the 600 km-range Kh-65SE (derived from the Kh-55) announced in 1992, then the 300 km-range Kh-SD tactical version of the Kh-101 for export, and finally the Kh-555. In 2001 the Russian Air Force are believed to have selected the Kh-101 and Kh-555 for development.

A 1995 Russian document suggested that a complete production facility had been transferred to Shanghai, for the development of a nuclear-armed cruise missile. Originally it was thought that this was based on the 300 km-range Raduga Kh-15 (AS-16 &quot;Kickback&quot;), but it appears that it was the Kh-55 that was transferred to China.

==Design==

The original Kh-55 was powered by a drop-down, Ukrainian-made 400 kgf Motor Sich JSC R95-300 turbofan engine, with pop-out wings for cruising efficiency. The Kh-65SE version had a fixed external turbojet engine, while the Kh-SD had its engine inside the body of the missile. Production versions in 2013 were equipped with the increased-power 450 kgf Russian-made NPO Saturn TRDD-50A engine.

The missile can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300 ft altitude). After launch, the missile&#x27;s folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an inertial guidance system plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target with a high degree of accuracy.

In the nuclear role, Kh-55 carries a warhead designated TK66, with a warhead weight of . The mass-size simulator for the warhead is designated KTS-120-12.

==Operational history==
The original Kh-55 entered service on 31 December 1983. The Kh-55SM followed in 1987. The conventionally armed Kh-55SE was flight tested on 13 January 2000, and first used in exercises over the Black Sea 17–22 April 2000. The Kh-555 is thought to have entered service in 2004.

The Kh-55 can be carried by the Tu-95MS (NATO &quot;Bear-H&quot;) and Tu-142M (NATO &quot;Bear-F&quot;), and the Kh-55SM is carried by the Tupolev Tu-160 &quot;White Swan&quot; (NATO &quot;Blackjack&quot;). Sixteen Kh-55s can be carried by the Tu-95MS16 variant, ten on underwing hardpoints and six on an MKU-5-6 rotary launcher. The missile was also tested on the Tu-22M (NATO &quot;Backfire&quot;) bombers.

The end of the Cold War left Ukraine with 1,612 Kh-55s, part of the armament of the 19 Tu-160s of the 184th Heavy Bomber Regiment at Pryluky and the 25 Tu-95MSs of the 182nd Heavy Bomber Regiment at Uzin-Shepelovka. It was reported that Ukraine demanded US$3 billion for the return of the planes and their missiles to Russia. In October 1999, a compromise was reached that saw Russia pay US$285 million for eight Tu-160 and three Tu-95MS bombers and 575 Kh-55 cruise missiles, while the rest were meant to be destroyed under U.S.-led Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction programme. However, in March 2005 Ukraine&#x27;s prosecutor-general Sviatoslav Piskun said that in 2001, twelve Kh-55s had been exported to Iran in a deal said to be worth US$49.5 million, and an additional six Kh-55s were exported to China. In March 2015, Iran subsequently revealed the existence of the Soumar cruise missile.

===Syrian Civil War===
In the course of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War on 17 November 2015, Russian Defence Ministry reported that Tupolev Tu-95MS and Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers launched a total of 34 air-launched cruise missiles against 14 ISIL targets in Syria. While the Tu-95MS used the Kh-55 cruise missiles, the Tu-160 were equipped with the stealthy Kh-101 variant in their first combat use.

Russian news agency TASS reported on 17 November 2016 that modernized Tu-95MS armed with Kh-555 and Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles had launched airstrikes against targets described as terrorist in Syria.

===2022 invasion of Ukraine===
The UK Ministry of Defence said in November 2022 that it appeared that Russian forces, due to very much depleted weapons stores, were firing old AS-15 Kent cruise missiles with the nuclear warheads apparently replaced by inert ballast, hoping merely to distract Ukrainian air defenses. However the missiles can still pose a serious risk due to their kinetic energy and any unspent fuel left in the missile that might explode.

Ukrainian Kh-55 nuclear missiles that had been transferred to Russia as part of a weapons-for-gas trade in 1999 were found to have been fired at Ukraine after Russian forces replaced their warheads with ballast, as dummy missiles used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences.

At least several civilians are known to have suffered as the result of such attacks. One Kh-55 hit an apartment building in the capital of Ukraine at the end of 2022, killing a woman. Another hit a house in Kyiv Oblast, injuring a child.

A Kh-55 missile with a ballast warhead, launched over Belarus on 16 December 2022, diverted course and fell in Poland, in a forest 15 km west of Bydgoszcz after having crossed around 500 km of Polish territory. According to Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki, it was detected by Polish and allied radars, however the missile was accidentally found only on 22 April 2023 and the incident was revealed a couple of days later. It is not clear, if its fall in Poland, near aviation repair works in Bydgoszcz, engaged in military aid for Ukraine, was caused by a technical failure of an old missile, or was a provocation.

==Variants==
* Kh-55 (NATO &quot;Kent-A&quot;, RKV-500A, &quot;Izdeliye&quot; 120) - original model with 2,500 km range. 
* Kh-55-OK - with optical guidance.
* Kh-55SM (NATO &quot;Kent-B&quot;, RKV-500B, &quot;Izdeliye&quot; 121) - with extra fuel tanks to extend range to 3000 km. 
* Kh-65SE - tactical version announced in 1992 with 410 kg conventional warhead and restricted to the 600 km range limit (expired on 2.8.2019) of the INF treaty.
* Kh-55/65SD (средней дальности &quot;Srednei Dalnosti&quot; - &quot;Medium Range&quot;) - 300 km range conventional version announced in 1995, possibly for export. Shared components with the Kh-101, range reportedly increased to 600 km with a high-altitude approach, but the Kh-SD was apparently shelved in 2001. An alternative active radar seeker was proposed for anti-shipping use.
* Kh-555 (NATO AS-22 &quot;Kluge&quot;) - conventionally armed version with an improved guidance system and warhead. It became operational in 2000. Entered service in 2004.
* Kh-BD conventional and nuclear armed version with said range up to 3000 km or greater, near or more than 5000 km range. The missile entered service in September 2023 on Tu-160 (12 missiles each). Its range was reported to be over 6,500 km.
* Kh-50 or Kh-SD new stealthy short to medium (300 to 1500–1900 km) ranges and conventional (or also nuclear) variant (somewhat analogue of AGM-158 JASSM). Length: 6m, uses inertial/GLONASS/DSMAC guidance.
* Soumar - Likely Kh55-derived missile produced by Iran.

It was believed originally that the RK-55 (SSC-X-4 &quot;Slingshot&quot; and SS-N-21 &quot;Sampson&quot;) were land- and submarine-launched derivatives of the Kh-55, but it is now known that the Kh-55 is different from the other two as its motor drops down below the missile during flight.

== Operators ==
===Current operators===
* : acquired 12 from Ukraine.
* : acquired 6 from Ukraine.
* : the Russian Air Force uses the Kh-55SM and Kh-555.

===Former operators===
* : the Soviet Air Force deployed the Kh-55 as its original operator, passed to successor states after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
* : ~487 scrapped, ~587 transferred to Russia

<text>Socialist Youth Front (Danish: Socialistisk UngdomsFront, abbreviated SUF) is a socialist political youth organisation in Denmark, consisting of 1,500 members&lt;ref name=&quot;http://socialistiskungdomsfront.dk/nyheder/1518/vi-er-de-1523-der-skal-til-stormode&quot;&gt;Vi er de 1523 der skal til stormøde - ungdomsfront.dk &lt;/ref&gt; distributed between 35 autonomous local groups.

It was established in 2001 on the initiative of the youth group Rebel and the youth network of the Red-Green Alliance (&quot;Enhedslisten&quot;). Currently, Socialist Youth Front often cooperates with the Red-Green Alliance, and around 80 percent of SUF members are also members of the Red-Green Alliance, though SUF itself retains an extraparliamentary focus.

Socialist Youth Front is a uniting organisation for the left-wing radical youth, and it consists of many ideological persuasions, ranging from Leninists, democratic socialists to anarchists. The politics and doctrine of SUF is, however, based on an anti-parliamentarian, revolutionary, and Marxist world view.

The organization publishes the external magazine &quot;Avanti&quot;, as well as the internal newsletter &quot;Blomster og Barrikader&quot; (&quot;Flowers and Barricades&quot;).

The highest authority of the Socialist Youth Front is the national congress, which is held twice a year. Once a year, 9 members are elected to the board of leadership, which consists of 25 members, the last 16 being regional representatives who are elected locally.

<text>Venstres Ungdom (literally: &quot;Youth of the Left&quot;) is the youth wing of the Danish liberal Party Venstre.

==History==
The first branch of Venstres Ungdom was founded in Kolding in 1908, and the nationwide organization was established in 1912. This makes the youth wing older than the mother party, Venstre, which was established in its current form in 1910.

When Venstres Ungdom was founded, Denmark had a bicameral parliament, and suffrage to one of the houses (&quot;Landstinget&quot;) was reserved for men no younger than 35. Consequently, Venstres Ungdom was intended as an organization for Liberals younger than 35. When turning 35, a member became entitled to transfer his membership to the &quot;real&quot; political party Venstre. When &quot;Landstinget&quot; was abolished in 1953 this distinction became irrelevant, and members are now free to choose if they wish to belong to Venstres Ungdom, Venstre or both organizations. Most members transfer their membership from Venstres Ungdom to Venstre when they approach the age of 30.

==Venstres Ungdom today==
Venstres Ungdom is one of the largest political youth organization in Denmark. As of 31 December 2009, it had 1,730 members. Members play a major role in the election campaigns of Venstre. Other activities include organizing seminars and debates. The nationwide organization has a committee corresponding to each cabinet department headed by a Venstre politician. These committees hold regular meetings with the relevant cabinet ministers. A VU spokesman is elected to represent the organization for each major area. As of January 2006, the number of spokesmen is fourteen.

==Current leaders of Venstres Ungdom==
* Chairman: Lasse B. Sørensen
* Deputy Chairman: Martin Dommerby
The Chairman and Deputy Chairman are elected by the annual National Congress (&quot;Landsstævnet&quot;) along with seven other members to the Executive Committee. The Treasurer is appointed by the National Board (&quot;Landsstyrelsen&quot;), amongst the members of the Executive Committee.

==Organization==
Important characteristics of Venstres Ungdom include
* Decisions made by Venstre are not binding for Venstres Ungdom (and vice versa).
* Venstres Ungdom is, legally speaking, completely independent and not a mere branch of Venstre.
* The national organization has no control or ownership over its local branches. The most important part of the organization is the local branches. Each branch is represented by one representative in the National Board (&quot;Landsstyrelsen&quot;). The remaining nine members, including both Chairman and Deputy Chairman, are elected by the annual National Congress. It is an important aspect of VU ideology, that the national organization is organized &quot;bottom-up&quot;. All offices are elected with a term of office of one year. 

The combination of these characteristics makes Venstres Ungdom unique among the Danish political youth organizations.

The organization of the more recent Youth of the Socialist Peoples Party and Socialist Youth Front shows some similarities to the VU organization.

A traditional way of recognizing a resigning member&#x27;s work for the organisation is by electing the person in question to the office of second deputy auditor (). This election takes place on all levels of the organization as part of the annual general meeting, along with the more serious elections of two auditors and a (first) deputy auditor. Unlike the first three mentioned, the second deputy auditor is a purely honorary title.

This tradition dates from the of the first VU branch in Kolding in 1908, when the newly elected second deputy auditor was informed by his high school principal that if he did not relinquish this new office immediately, he would be expelled from his school since it would be futile to attempt combining academic pursuits with a political career. Since the student&#x27;s office carried virtually no obligations, VU history records this as the first clear case of harassment against the organization. Since then the unfortunate student&#x27;s title has been used for honorary purposes.

<text>The Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (formerly known as the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1969 NBA Finals. The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award. The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O&#x27;Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.

Since its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner. LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O&#x27;Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award, as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old. In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old. Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series. Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.

Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams, while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences. Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team. Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an &quot;international&quot; player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C. Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.

On February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the &quot;Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award&quot; in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.

<text>Aristida stricta, known as wiregrass or pineland three-awn grass, is a warm-season grass native to North America. The species dominates understory vegetation in sandhills and flatwoods coastal plain ecosystems of the Carolinas in the Southeastern United States. Its appearance is characterized by villous bristles (indument) on each side of its midrib and on the back of the involute leaf blade.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The common name of &quot;Aristida stricta&quot;, wiregrass, gave rise to the naming of the Wiregrass Region in which it is located. The species was first described by André Michaux in 1803. In 1993, the southern population of the species was split off and described as &quot;Aristida beyrichiana&quot; because of geographic and morphological differences. The two species were treated as an &quot;&quot;Aristida stricta&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; species complex&quot;. However, a decade later, further anatomical studies suggested that the two species did not have sufficient morphological differences to be considered separate. As of 2024, Plants of the World Online accepted &quot;Aristida beyrichiana&quot; as separate from &quot;A. stricta&quot;.

== Ecology ==
This is a fast-growing species that regenerates quickly after fires. The plant depends on regular summer burning in order to stimulate flowering and seed production.

<text>33 Arch Street is a contemporary highrise in the Financial District and Downtown Crossing neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. The building was completed in 2004 after three years of construction, which began on June 5, 2001. It is tied with the State Street Bank Building as Boston&#x27;s 27th-tallest building, standing tall, and housing 33 floors. The 33rd floor is above grade and the top of the cooling tower screen is above grade. It was designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects.

==History==
The builders had proposed a transparent glass building but ran into opposition from the historic Old South Meeting House.

When the building was completed, it had a hard time finding tenants due to an office space glut and stood vacant upon completion. By 2005, 56% of the office space was rented and the average rent on a monthly parking space was $350.

In March 2010, 33 Arch Street was awarded the LEED Gold designation from the U.S. Green Building Council. In November 2010, the building was selected as BOMA&#x27;s 2010-2011 Outstanding Building of the Year in the 500,000-1 Million Square Feet category.

==Design and features==

The building has views of Boston Common, the Charles River, City Hall Plaza, and Boston Harbor. 33 Arch Street offers over of office space and has 850 parking spaces in its underground parking garage.

===Architecture===
The building has a unique wing shape to maximize the use of its tight footprint. The building strikes a balance with its surroundings and neighboring buildings through the use of the granite stone facade used to add to continuity of the urban streetscape. Yet, it is distinct from its neighbors by the extensive use of metal and glass in its exterior.

The building facade features grey granite, glass and aluminum cladding. Twenty floors cantilever over adjacent retail space and a garage, which is connected to parking on the first six levels. The roof has a distinctive top that sets it apart from nearby flat roofs in the skyline. It features a curved penthouse and roof fins.

The building uses four levels of external bracing transfer the enormous loads of the high building into the small base. The bracing continues through the parking levels to the foundation; perimeter and internal moment frames act as the lateral system above the braced levels. The building was the first to be built in downtown Boston under new Safety Guidelines-Subpart R for steel.

<text>Cymuned (translated in English as &quot;community&quot;, ) was a Welsh communities pressure group. Established in 2001, the group campaigned on behalf of local communities in Wales, particularly (but not exclusively) Welsh-speaking and rural ones, which it perceived to be under threat due to demographic change.

They protested against the Welsh train company Arriva Trains Wales for the lack of use of the Welsh language on its services, and the holiday agents Thomas Cook for banning the use of Welsh in its Bangor branch in 2007.

Critics argued that estate agents were providing a commercial service to the Welsh people who contracted them to sell or rent their property in return for market value and that the sharp rise in the cost of property in recent years was not confined to Wales but an international phenomenon of the growing world economy, however Cymuned argued that there was a need to create a secondary sustainable local housing market in rural Wales. A new campaign designed to ensure that a sustainable proportion of new homes should be for locals only is based on planning policy that had already been adopted in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, as well as parts of Shropshire, Devon, the Peak District and the Lake District.

Cymuned also campaigned on behalf of the Rhostyllen community near Wrexham against plans by the National Trust to develop land next to the village for high-priced housing.

The chief executive of Cymuned was Aran Jones, who had learnt Welsh as a second language. Other notable members included the poet and musician, Twm Morys (who won the chair at the 2003 national eisteddfod), Dr Simon Brooks, former editor of the Welsh language current affairs magazine &quot;Barn&quot;, Judith Humphreys, a Welsh actress and Dr Jerry Hunter, an American Harvard graduate who moved to Wales to learn Welsh and has remained in Wales ever since, working in academic posts at the University of Wales.

<text>Danmarks Kommunistiske Ungdom (Communist Youth of Denmark), was the youth wing of Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti (Communist Party of Denmark). DKU had its origins in Socialdemokratisk Ungdomsforbund (Social Democratic Youth League) founded in 1906. The organization took the name DKU in 1919.

DKU was dissolved in 1990, but in 2009, a spiritual successor (established with the name &quot;Ungkommunisterne&quot;, but renamed back to Danmarks Kommunistiske Ungdom during the organizations restart in 2021) was founded as an independent organization shared informally between the Communist Party of Denmark, the Communist Party in Denmark, and the Communist Party (Denmark), which still participates in the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

<doc id="1109061" wikidata="Q1397550" url="?curid=1109061" title="Rampon, Count of Barcelona">
<text>Rampon (Rampó) was the second count of the Catalan counties of Barcelona and Osona from 820 until his death in 825.

Rampon was given the county of Barcelona, by Louis the Pious, King of Aquitaine, following Bera&#x27;s accusation of treason, trial by combat, and his subsequent defeat. During his time as count of Barcelona, Rampon founded monasteries, all of Frankish origin, thus spreading Carolingian hegemony throughout the Spanish March.

Rampon was ruler of Barcelona, Girona, and Besalú with the title of Count, but possibly also Margrave; the latter title was reserved only for the rulers of border counties.

In 821, the Court at Aachen ordered Rampon to attack Muslim territory, an order which he carried out in 822, ransacking land up to the river Segre. The same year, Louis the Pious at the request of Rampon, granted privileges to the monastery Saint-Stephen of Banyoles.

Rampon died in 825. However, it was not until an assembly in Aachen in February 826 that Louis designated his successor to be Bernard of Septimania, the son of William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, and younger half-brother of Gaucelm, Count of Empúries and Roussillon.

<text>One Federal Street is a skyscraper in the Financial District neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Completed in 1975, it is Boston&#x27;s 15th-tallest building, standing 520 feet (159 m) tall, and housing 38 floors. It is very close to the Rose F. Kennedy Greenway, Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Construction of the building was completed in 1976. However, it underwent renovations between 1992 and 2011. Some of the most notable tenants include: AON Service Corporation, Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Oppenheimer, and U.S. Bank.

==Design and features==
The building boasts an area spanning 1,118,355 square feet for rent as well as a two-story parking garage underneath.

Other features of the building include: covered parking, an on-site restaurant and coffee stand, banking facilities, and outstanding views of the surrounding area and Boston Harbor. As well, the building&#x27;s penthouse is home to the Harvard Club. Further, it is very accessible to all the city&#x27;s major highways and public transportation.

Once known as the Shawmut Bank Building, it was renamed when that bank was purchased. It is built on the site of the former First National Bank Building, the offices of which were moved to the modern First National Bank Building in 1971. Today, both One Federal Street and the FNB Building are occupied by Bank of America. This building is currently under study as a pending landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

<text>Flatwoods, pineywoods, pine savannas and longleaf pine–wiregrass ecosystem are terms that refer to an ecological community in the southeastern coastal plain of North America. Flatwoods are an ecosystem maintained by wildfire or prescribed fire and are dominated by longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;), and slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliotii&quot;) in the tree canopy and saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;), gallberry (&quot;Ilex glabra&quot;) and other flammable evergreen shrubs in the understory, along with a high diversity of herb species. It was once one of the dominant ecosystem types of southeastern North America. Although grasses and pines are characteristic of this system, the precise composition changes from west to east, that is, from Texas to Florida. In Louisiana, savannas even differ between the east and west side of the Mississippi River. The key factor maintaining this habitat type is recurring fire. Without fire, the habitat is eventually invaded by other species of woody plants.

A number of rare and endangered animals are typical of this habitat including red-cockaded woodpeckers (&quot;Picoides borealis&quot;), gopher tortoises (&quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot;), frosted flatwoods salamanders (&quot;Ambystoma cingulatum&quot;), and striped newts (&quot;Notophthalmus perstriatus&quot;). Many rare and usual herbaceous plants are found here, particularly orchids (e.g. &quot;Calopogon&quot; species, &quot;Pogonia ophioglossoides&quot;), sedges (e.g. &quot;Rhynchospora&quot; species) and carnivorous plants (e.g. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; species).

A second key factor is moisture. Overall, wet pine savannas have more species than pine savannas, and the distribution of each species within a savanna is intimately connected with soil moisture regimes. Temporary ponds, and seepage areas, are therefore a critical control on plant species composition. Orchids and pitcher plants, for example, are associated with wetter locations. But even these wetter locations burn during dry periods, allowing regeneration of species of pitcher plant and sundew.

Pineywoods are characterized by low basal area and large widely spaced mature pine. Historically, the flatwoods were dominated by longleaf pine, which can live to be 500 years old. Large scale overharvesting in conjunction with detrimental silvicultural practices like replacement with faster growing loblolly pine has drastically reduced the range of the longleaf pine ecosystem. Longleaf requires frequent fires, ideally every 1–3 years, which prevent invasion of the habitat by other tree species. Decades of fire exclusion in the Southeast have contributed to the decline of this community type. However, with the restoration of fire, and natural flooding regimes, it is possible to restore small areas of habitat. Some private organisations are engaged in such projects. With concerted effort, several large wilderness areas could still be restored east of the Mississippi River. Some of the largest remaining areas of this habitat type are found in De Soto National Forest, Eglin Air Force Base, and Apalachicola National Forest.

<text>North Vancouver is a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988.

Under the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed North Vancouver—Capilano.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census; 2013 representation&quot;

Languages: 69.8% English, 7.7% Persian, 2.2% Tagalog, 2.1% Mandarin, 1.9% Korean, 1.8% French, 1.6% Spanish, 1.6% German, 1.5% Cantonese
Religions (2011): 47.2% Christian (18.2% Catholic, 7.0% Anglican, 6.6% United Church, 1.6% Lutheran, 1.5% Presbyterian, 1.4% Christian Orthodox, 1.3% Baptist 9.6% Other), 6.3% Muslim, 42.5% No religion 
Median income (2010): $39,040 
Average income (2010): $58,194

==Geography==
This district includes the entirety of the City of North Vancouver and the majority of the District of North Vancouver.

==History==
This riding was created in 1987 from portions of North Vancouver—Burnaby and Capilano electoral districts.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of North Vancouver should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined North Vancouver loses the eastern portion of its current territory to the new district of Burnaby North—Seymour, while its western boundary with West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country is adjusted to correspond to the boundaries between the District of North Vancouver, West Vancouver and the Capilano Indian Reserve. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will be replaced by the new riding of North Vancouver—Capilano. It will gain all of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country south of the Trans-Canada Highway and east of 21 St, and lose the Lynn Valley and Lynmour areas to Burnaby North—Seymour. These changes will come into effect upon the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:






North Vancouver, as well as surrounding North Shore ridings, typically elect right-leaning candidates in federal elections. For nearly 25 consecutive years between 1979 and 2004, North Vancouver and its predecessor, North Vancouver-Burnaby, were held by a member of the major &quot;small-c&quot; conservative party of the day. The stream was however interrupted in the 2004 general election, when outgoing North Vancouver (city) mayor Don Bell was able to swing the riding over to the Liberals, just narrowly defeating long-time incumbent Conservative MP Ted White. Bell was re-elected in the 2006 election (by less than 4% of the vote), though in neither of his two terms did the sitting parliament even make it to the halfway point of its five-year mandate before an election was held. In the 2008 election, North Vancouver businessman Andrew Saxton returned the riding to the Conservatives, winning a plurality of the vote (by less than 5% of the vote) and defeating the incumbent Don Bell.

Saxton served as parliamentary secretary to multiple cabinet ministers in the Conservative majority government, including Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance (Jim Flaherty). In the 2015 general election, amidst a climate of growing dissatisfaction with the government and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, as well as the emergence of populous strategic voting, Liberal candidate Jonathan Wilkinson defeated Saxton by almost a 2-to-1 margin, and serves as parliamentary secretary to the minister of environment and climate change in the Liberal majority government in Canada&#x27;s 43rd parliament.

<text>One Financial Center is a modern skyscraper adjacent to Dewey Square in the Financial District of Boston, Massachusetts. Built in 1983 by Rose Associates, it is Boston&#x27;s 11th-tallest building, standing tall, and housing 46 floors. An unusual tall glass-roofed lobby, known as the atrium, occupies the first two stories. The remaining stories are offices, home to a number of law firms, Certified Public Accountants, and financial services companies.

The building is located on a historic triangular piece of land next to South Station and the Federal Reserve Bank Building, joining the Fort Point Channel area with Boston&#x27;s Financial District.

During the Big Dig (a project to create a new underground highway under the center of Boston), extra care was needed to avoid subsidence of the soil under the building, as construction was underway just from the building&#x27;s foundation. The building was constructed on soil rather than bedrock due to the geography of the site.

The tower is topped off by two radio masts. Including its radio masts, One Financial Center is the 4th-tallest building in Boston (when measuring by pinnacle height), rising . Apart from the masts and their supporting cables, the roof of the building is flat with no crown.

VSU was dissolved in 1992. Members of VSU were active in the establishment of the new youth organization REBEL the very same year.
