<text>Foster and Partners (also Foster + Partners) is a British international architecture firm with its headquarters in London, England. It was founded in 1967 by British architect and designer Norman Foster. The firm has been involved in the design of major projects around the world, including the Gherkin in London, the Hearst Tower in New York City, the 1990s renovation of the Reichstag in Berlin, the Millau Viaduct in France, and Hong Kong International Airport.

In addition to architectural design, the firm&#x27;s practice encompasses engineering and industrial design. As of 2021, the firm had approximately 1,500 employees in New York City, Hong Kong, and Madrid. The firm has won the Pritzker Architecture Prize and the Stirling Prize. By 2024, Foster + Partner earned more than half a billion dollars in fees. 40% of Foster + Partner&#x27;s fees were paid by clients in the Middle East.

==History==
The firm was established by Norman Foster in 1967, shortly after leaving his first studio, Team 4. The firm was originally called Foster Associates before the name was changed to Foster &amp; Partners in 1999.

In 2007, the private equity company 3i took a stake in the firm. The practice regained complete ownership in June 2014, when the 140 partners bought it back.

In October 2021, a significant stake in the firm was bought for an undisclosed sum by a Canadian private investor, Hennick &amp; Company, which became the single largest shareholder of the firm. Foster retains a controlling interest.

==Criticism==
In June 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized real estate development in a pristine seacoast area in Bulgaria, which was under EU environmental protection. The paper cited environmentalists&#x27; concerns over the impact of the planned 15,000-inhabitant resort facilities. The Bulgarian partner Georgi Stanishev, is the brother of Sergey Stanishev, who served as the Prime Minister of Bulgaria between 2005 and 2009 and is also the Leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

<text>George Derek Ibbotson (17 June 1932 – 23 February 2017) was an English runner who excelled in athletics in the 1950s. His most famous achievement was setting a new world record in the mile in 1957.

==Biography==
Ibbotson was born on 17 June 1932 in Huddersfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and studied at King James&#x27;s Grammar School, Almondbury. He was of the generation that included other great British &#x27;milers&#x27; (1 mile running specialists) such as Roger Bannister, Chris Brasher and Christopher Chataway. He was the junior champion in Britain in 1951.

After service in the Royal Air Force, Ibbotson returned to competition. At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, he won a bronze medal in the 5,000 metres. After the games, Ibbotson focused on the mile. Ibbotson began the 1957 season running in mile races, as a 5,000m or 3 mile runner would often do in the early part of the racing season - to race at a faster pace than he would need in those longer distances. After he had run a particularly fast mile at a Glasgow meeting, an experienced athletics official told the BBC that while it was a very good time, he and many others felt that Ibbotson’s greater potential was over 5,000m or 3 miles. In a race dubbed &quot;the mile of the century&quot;, Ibbotson won with a new world record time, taking 0.8 of a second off John Landy&#x27;s time of 3.58 min set in 1954. Ibbotson continued competing in mile races throughout the season as well as some longer distance events - and ended the season exhausted.

Ibbotson never found the same form again. He represented England in the Empire Games at Cardiff in 1958, finishing tenth in the 3 miles. Ibbotson soldiered on and in 1960, in a bid to enter the Rome Olympics, he copied Gordon Pirie who, when he was struggling for form, increased his racing and took part in shorter races than usual, because it was good speed training. Ibbotson was not so successful and was not selected. Ibbotson continued to compete for much of the 1960s. After a poor 1961 season, he found success on the indoor circuit, becoming the 1962 European Indoor champion for 2 miles (8:47.8).

He was one of many signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 opposing the policy of apartheid in international sport and defending &#x27;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&#x27;.

In 2004 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Laws from the University of Huddersfield. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to athletics. In 2011, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.

A qualified electrical engineer, he worked initially for the Coal Board but later was employed in sales, latterly as an executive and agent for Puma, the sportswear company. Turning later to squash, he became good enough to represent Yorkshire, twice winning the Yorkshire veterans championship. He also played golf until he was in his 70s.

Ibbotson was married twice. His first wife, Madeline Wooller, was an English cross country international runner. They had three daughters together, Christine, Nicola and Georgina. Madeline and Ibbotson divorced. Years later Ibbotson fell in love and married Ann Parmenter. They had a daughter together, Joanna. Ann died in 1997.

Ibbotson died in Wakefield on 23 February 2017, aged 84. A large crowd attended his funeral service led by The Vicar of Huddersfield, the Rev Canon Simon Moor, at St Peter’s Church in Huddersfield, who said Derek Ibbotson epitomised all that was life-enhancing about sport and noted that &quot;two of Derek’s proudest achievements were being awarded his MBE in 2008 and receiving an honorary degree from Huddersfield University.&quot;

<text>Workbook is the 1989 debut solo album by American guitarist and singer Bob Mould, following the breakup of the influential punk rock band Hüsker Dü. The album has a strong folk influence and lighter overall sound than he had been known for, although heavy guitar features occasionally. Drummer Anton Fier and bassist Tony Maimone, both of Pere Ubu fame, served as Mould&#x27;s rhythm section on the album and on the subsequent live shows. The single &quot;See a Little Light&quot; was a hit on the US Modern Rock chart.

The album has been influential in the alternative rock community: its acoustic elements would be echoed in R.E.M.&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, while Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;In Utero&quot; used cellos in a similar way. Mould considered the term &quot;alternative rock&quot; to be meaningless, arguing that Hüsker Dü sounded the same no matter its record label, and that his former bandmates were disinterested in exploring different sounds.

In the liner notes of the Hüsker Dü live album &quot;The Living End&quot;, writer David Fricke noted that Mould had an embryonic version of the song &quot;Compositions for the Young and Old&quot; in the waning days of that band.

&quot;Poison Years&quot; is directed at Hüsker Dü drummer Grant Hart. &quot;There&#x27;s people who think I&#x27;m still sending missiles to Grant,&quot; said Mould at the time of his band Sugar&#x27;s album &quot;File Under Easy Listening&quot; in 1994. &quot;Sorry to disappoint you, but I took care of that about five years ago. Check out side one, song five on &quot;Workbook&quot;.&quot; In 1989, however, Mould claimed that the song was about himself and his life after the band.

The album was reissued on CD and double LP for its 25th anniversary in 2014 as &quot;Workbook 25&quot;, by Omnivore Recordings. This remastered edition includes an extra track, &quot;All Those People Know&quot;, and a second CD-only disc containing a 1989 live set by Mould at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; opined that &quot;&quot;Workbook&quot; stands among the most complete artistic statements to emerge this year... It does for introspection what Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;New York&quot; did for social awareness, and shares the feeling of catharsis John Lennon brought to &#x27;How Do You Sleep?&#x27; and &#x27;Gimme Some Truth&#x27; on &quot;Imagine&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; noted that &quot;the emotionally draining album is littered with the charred remains of his former band, but the bitterness is framed with a sense of honesty and openness that&#x27;s effectively reflected by Mould&#x27;s singing.&quot;

<text>Joseph A. Schwarcz (born 1947) is an author and a sessional instructor at McGill University. He is the director of McGill&#x27;s Office for Science and Society.

==Early life==
Schwarcz is an only child, born in Sopron, Hungary, to Jewish parents. During the Hungarian uprising in 1956, when he was age nine, the family escaped over the border to Austria and migrated to Canada and settled in Montreal, Quebec. Schwarcz attended Logan school on Darlington and went on to study chemistry at McGill University in Montreal where he received a BSc (1969) and PhD (1973).

Schwarcz became interested in magic and chemistry at the age of nine, when he saw a magician perform a rope trick at a school friend&#x27;s birthday party. &quot;Instead of using the usual magic words like Abracadabra, he said that he was going to sprinkle a &#x27;Magic Chemical&#x27; on the ropes.&quot; Schwarcz was so intrigued that he went to the library and looked up chemistry; he has had a keen interest in both since that day.

==Biography==

Schwarcz started his teaching career at Dawson College before moving to Vanier College serving as chair of the Department of Chemistry at both colleges. He then returned to McGill University in 1980 where he teaches in courses in the Department of Chemistry and Faculty of Medicine with an emphasis on alternative medicine.
In 1999 Schwarcz became the founding director of the McGill University Office for Science and Society (OSS) with Ariel Fenster and David N. Harpp. The OSS &quot;...is a unique venture dedicated to the promotion of critical thinking and the presentation of scientific information to the public, educators and students in an accurate and responsible fashion.&quot; As director, he takes on health fads and the celebrities who promote them. He has used his knowledge of magic to show how supernatural feats can be done by ordinary means.

Even as a university student, Schwarcz found chemistry to be a dry subject, so he established a series of courses designed to bring chemistry to the general student, and later to the public through a series of lectures. The lectures include magic and spontaneity to keep the audience interested.

&quot;A good lecturer is also an actor. A lecture should seem spontaneous, even if it&#x27;s been given many times before... You capture the audience&#x27;s attention. Then, without their realizing it, you pump a little scientific information into their brains. Before they know it, they&#x27;ve learned something.&quot;

In 2010, 2012, and 2016–2017, Schwarcz was nominated by McGill as one of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Nifty Fifty Speakers.

Schwarcz began his media career in 1980 after meeting &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reporter Ted Blackman at the Man and His World exhibition when he was demonstrating how to make polyurethane from two liquids. Blackman reported on the demonstration and made a significant error. Schwarcz wrote to the &quot;Gazette&quot;, pointing out the error, and Blackman printed a retraction. Radio station CJAD picked up the story and called Schwarcz to talk about it on air. The following week another scientific issue arose and he was called on again; this led to regular collaborations and to his own weekly radio show (&quot;The Dr. Joe Show&quot;), which also ran on Toronto&#x27;s CFRB for about two years.

Schwarcz has appeared hundreds of times on Canadian television and radio, including his single-season show about common foods called &quot;Science to Go&quot; on the Canadian Discovery Channel. He writes a weekly column for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; called &quot;The Right Chemistry&quot; and a monthly column in the Canadian Chemical News.

He is one of the spokespersons for ScienceUpFirst, a science communication initiative aiming at reducing the impact of COVID misinformation online.

In 1999 Schwarcz was awarded the Grady-Stack Award for Interpreting Chemistry for the Public. At the time, he was the first non-American to win the award. He was the joint winner of the 2014 Center for Skeptical Inquiry Robert P Balles Prize for skeptical thinking for his book &quot;Is This a Fact?&quot;

Schwarcz has honorary doctorates from Athabasca University (2002), Cape Breton University (2011), and Simon Fraser University (2019).

==Personal life==

Schwarcz and his wife Alice were married in 1973 and have three children. Alice died in March 2016.

<text>Dobbins Air Reserve Base or Dobbins ARB is a United States Air Force reserve air base located in Marietta, Georgia, a suburb about northwest of Atlanta. Originally known as Dobbins Air Force Base, it was named in honor of Captain Charles M. Dobbins, a World War II C-47 pilot who died near Sicily.

The installation is the home station of the host wing, the 94th Airlift Wing (94 AW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and its fleet of C-130 Hercules aircraft, and is also the location of the headquarters for AFRC&#x27;s Twenty-Second Air Force (22 AF).

Dobbins ARB is also home to Army Aviation Service Facility #2 (AASF #2) of the Georgia Army National Guard and their fleet of UH-60 Blackhawks and UH-72 Lakota helicopters. Associated units to AASF #2 include 1st Battalion, 171st General Support Aviation Regiment; Company H, 171st Aviation Regiment; Company C, 2nd Battalion, 151st Aviation; and Detachment 1, Company C, 111th General Aviation Support Battalion, 111th Aviation Regiment.

Additional Reserve component organizations at Dobbins include various units of the Marine Corps Reserve and Navy Reserve.

Dobbins ARB has two runways which it shares with the General Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center (formerly Naval Air Station Atlanta) to its south. Runway 11/29 is the primary runway and is long and wide with directions 110 and 290 magnetic. The second runway, called an &quot;assault strip&quot;, is a 3500×60-foot (1067×18-meter) runway referred to as 110–290, which is parallel to Runway 11/29.

Over 14,000 flight operations occur annually making the Dobbins complex an extremely active facility with diverse air traffic operations from all branches of the military and other US government agencies. This air traffic environment takes place within the area of the busiest airport in the world (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and is as busy as many medium-sized commercial airports.

==History==

===World War II===
Originally intended by Cobb County, Georgia, as an alternative airfield for Atlanta&#x27;s Candler Field, this airfield was constructed in 1941 as &quot;Rickenbacker Field&quot;. This was named for the former U.S. Army Air Corps top flying ace of World War I, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker.

The push to build this airport came in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt selected General Lucius D. Clay of the Army Air Corps to be the chief of the new Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), which was engaged in a huge program of airfield construction. About 450 to 500 of these were built in preparation for any possible war against the United States - from the east (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) or from the west (the Empire of Japan).

In 1940, the CAA offered to build a modern paved airport in Cobb County if the local governments provided the land. Due to the potential labor force for defense factories in this area, local officials also hoped to attract a large aircraft factory adjacent to the site. On October 24, the government of Cobb County announced the existence of this airport project, and it also revealed that purchase options had been signed for three prospective sites. The Atlanta City Council also passed a resolution endorsing this project on January 2, 1941. Since the Army Air Corps had recently taken over part of Candler Field (now Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport), the principal municipal airport for Atlanta, the new airport in Cobb County was also seen as a reliever airport for Atlanta.

In May, the local government issued bonds to purchase located miles southeast of Marietta along the western side of the new four-lane superhighway, U.S. Highway 41, linking Marietta with Atlanta. The CAA next allocated $400,000 for construction of two -long runways on the land. The W. L. Florence Company of Powder Springs, Georgia, the low bidder with a bid of $290,000, won the contract. This bid, well-below the estimated cost of $400,000, allowed the CAA to add the third runway to this construction project. The construction began on 14 July 1941. In the next month, the Gulf Oil Corporation and Georgia Air Services agreed to lease the airport, once completed, for $12,000 per year. In September 1941, Eddie Rickenbacker, America&#x27;s leading flying ace of World War I, and then the president and general manager of Eastern Airlines, agreed to have this airport named &quot;Rickenbacker Field&quot; in his honor. In the same month, the U.S. Navy requested permission to use this airport for the flight training of Naval aviators. (The Navy had established the &quot;Naval Aviation Reserve Base Atlanta&quot;, at what is now the DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, in March 1941.) In October, Georgia Air Services signed a $70,000 contract for two 180x160-ft. airplane hangars to be built. Although it was far from completion, the dedication of this airfield took place in October 1941

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, work on this new airfield accelerated rapidly. In January 1942, Lawrence Dale Bell, the founder and president of the Bell Aircraft Company, inspected this site for a proposed government-financed airplane factory for the Department of War. Meanwhile, the Department of the Navy announced its intention to take over the new airfield as an auxiliary naval air station. The Navy shortly began land-condemnation proceedings.

The Department of War, in turn, announced that it would not contest the wish of the Department of the Navy to take over Rickenbacker Field, and that it would build its new factory elsewhere. The Cobb County government appealed to the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, urging him to change the Navy&#x27;s plans. Since other options were available for flight training. Secretary Knox relinquished the Navy&#x27;s claim on this airfield and left it to the Army Air Forces. (During World War II, the Navy established an auxiliary naval air station at Gainesville, Georgia, just northeast of Atlanta.)

On January 23, 1942, the Bell Aircraft Company and the Department of War announced that an aircraft factory employing up to 40,000 workers would be built near Marietta. Also, the Department of War announced on February 19 that &quot;Rickenbacker Field&quot; would be renamed the Marietta Army Airfield. Although its construction began in March 1942, its official ground-breaking ceremony took place in May 1942, with Captain Rickenbacker present. Rickenbacker went on to establish and pay for an aviation educational program to train workers for both civil aviation and military aviation. Also in 1942, the City of Atlanta began work on its contribution: a pipeline to supply the new factory with water from the Chattahoochee River.

In addition to taking over Rickenbacker Field, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) purchased a parcel of land just north of the airfield for a cantonment area. The Marietta Army Airfield was activated on June 6, 1943, with its personnel housed in tents as part of the 58th Bombardment Operational Training Wing. At the end of June 1943, there were 42 officers and 356 enlisted men stationed here.

The mission of the Marietta Army Airfield was acceptance testing of B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers for the USAAF, the modification of B-29s, and the operation of an Army Air Depot. Barracks for the soldiers reached completion in November 1943. By January 1, 1944, the number of soldiers stationed here had risen to 73 officers and 1,263 enlisted men. For a period of time, the Marietta Army Airfield was assigned to the USAAF&#x27;s Second Air Force under the XX Bomber Command. On 12 April 1944, the Marietta Army Airfield was reassigned to the &quot;17th Bombardment Operation Training Unit&quot;.


In the spring of 1943 the adjacent Bell Aircraft Company&#x27;s factory, an additional plant (besides a pair of Boeing plants Renton, Washington and Wichita, Kansas (former Stearman Aircraft) and a Martin plant at Offutt Field, Omaha, Nebraska) for manufacturing B-29 Superfortresses was completed. The &quot;Defense Plant Corporation&quot; of the Department of War paid for the construction of this factory, and the department called it &quot;Plant #6&quot;. Bell Aircraft completed its first B-29 on schedule, and this was first test-flown on November 4, 1943. The production of B-29s at this factory increased slowly during 1944, and by the fall of 1944, Bell Aircraft&#x27;s output of new B-29s began to meet and exceed the goals of the Department of War.

By January 1945, Bell Aircraft had completed 357 B-29A&#x27;s. After the completion of the last one of these, the production in Marietta was switched to the B-29B Superfortress, which was a simplified version of the B-29 without the computerized gun system and other components that raised the allowable bomb load from 11,000 to 18,000 pounds. The new B-29B radar, mounted in a wing-shaped radome under the fuselage, gave much better images of the ground. The 315th Bombardment Wing based at Northwest Field, Guam, received most of the B-29Bs for night low altitude pathfinder led missions against Japan. Bell built a total of 311 B-29Bs before the plant closed in January 1946. At its height, the Bell Bomber plant employed 28,263.

===Post-war===
Marietta Army Airfield remained open after the war and became the home of Georgia Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve units. The first post-war ANG unit, the 128th Fighter Squadron, activated at Marietta on 20 August 1946, with P-47 Thunderbolts. This was followed by the activation of the headquarters of the 116th Fighter Group on 9 September and the activation of the headquarters of the 54th Fighter Wing which commanded 56 units of the Air National Guard throughout the Southeastern states.

In 1948, part of the land and barracks at the original Naval Air Station Atlanta in nearby Chamblee were given to the state for the purpose of creating an engineering technology school that could rapidly train returning soldiers for civilian work in various technical fields.

Also in 1948 the airfield became Marietta Air Force Base as a result of the creation of the United States Air Force. In 1950, the Air Force renamed the base Dobbins Air Force Base in honor of Captain Charles M. Dobbins of Marietta, a World War II transport pilot. Captain Dobbins died near Sicily on July 11, 1943, when US Navy gunners who had earlier suffered a Luftwaffe (German air force) attack mistakenly downed his C-47. He was flying his third mission of the day, dropping paratroopers.

Following the war, the Bell Aircraft Plant #6 remained closed for five years. In 1951, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation took over the plant to modify B-29s for the Korean War. Lockheed also went on to build 394 B-47 Stratojets at the plant under license from Boeing. Additionally, Lockheed also conducted a B-47 modification program at Marietta. To handle the B-47 production and modification work, the airfield received a 10,000 × runway. Over the years, the Lockheed plant constructed the Lockheed JetStar business jet (C-140), C-130 Hercules, C-141 Starlifter, and C-5 Galaxy.

In 1957, Naval Air Station Atlanta (NAS Atlanta) at the present day Peachtree-DeKalb Airport in nearby Chamblee moved to Dobbins AFB. The Navy constructed a cantonment area on the southwest portion of Dobbins AFB for their use.

In 1962, the Southern Technical Institute (now Kennesaw State University) began classes on land given to the University System of Georgia by Dobbins AFB four years prior.

In June 1992 the official name was changed from Dobbins Air Force Base to Dobbins Air Reserve Base (Dobbins ARB). In 2003, the Air Force Reserve Command changed the name again to Dobbins Joint Air Reserve Base (Dobbins JARB). However, with the closure of the NAS Atlanta on 29 September 2009, the name reverted to Dobbins Air Reserve Base once again.

In September 2005, the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew out of Dobbins JARB after Hurricane Katrina did major damage to their normal home at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Numerous evacuees also came to metro Atlanta through Dobbins JARB, including many medevaced medical patients taken in by local hospitals.

Over the years, a wide variety of U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force aircraft have been stationed at Dobbins AFB with the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, including the P-51 Mustang, F-51 Mustang, F-84 Thunderstreak, F-86 Sabre, C-97 Stratocruiser, C-123 Provider, C-124 Globemaster II, F-100 Super Sabre, F-105 Thunderchief, F-4 Phantom II, C-7 Caribou, C-130 Hercules and the F-15 Eagle. Naval aircraft have included the A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II, A-6 Intruder, F/A-18 Hornet and C-9 Skytrain II of the U.S. Navy and OV-10 Bronco, AH-1 SeaCobra, UH-1 Huey and F/A-18 Hornet aircraft of the U.S. Marine Corps.

==Current and Future Use==
In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta to become Lockheed Martin. The C-130 Hercules remains in production 60 years after the first one rolled out in 1955. Work also continues on the F-22 Raptor and the Joint Strike Fighter. Dobbins ARB has its own ZIP code, 30069, and Lockheed Martin also has its own ZIP code, 30063, however, Marietta is the only place name (city) considered acceptable by the United States Postal Service for the latter.

Dobbins ARB is also an automated weather station, reporting five minutes before every hour. Until sometime in 2008, it only reported from 7am to 11pm (6:55 to 10:55/22:55), although it occasionally reported overnight during unusual weather conditions, such as strong winds due to the 2004 hurricanes (Frances, Jeanne, Ivan). Local conditions shown on The Weather Channel (TWC) and Weatherscan are now taken from a different system set up by TWC during the mid-2000s (decade); until then, overnight conditions for local cable TV systems came from Fulton County Airport.

Like most U.S. bases, Dobbins ARB has had to fend off several attempts at closing it, as part of streamlining the country&#x27;s military and reducing unnecessary spending. Development has steadily encroached upon the base since the war. 1978 OV-1 Mohawk 1989 A-7 Corsair II and 1993 C-130 Hercules plane crashes into residential areas near the base raised questions of safety in having a base in such a densely populated suburban area. The airfield now sits in a vast sea of urban development; flying demonstrations at air shows were discontinued some years ago because of safety concerns, although the Navy hosted air shows in 2004 and 2006, and the Air Force side hosted air shows in 2008 and 2010 (2008 marked the first time in over 15 years of a USAF Thunderbirds performance at KMGE).

Public complaints about the noise continue, and attempts to close the facility have been thwarted so far by powerful local politicians, such as former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn in 1995. However, some have proposed that it again become a commercial airport, as it was originally envisioned (there have been calls for Dobbins ARB to become the second major commercial airport in metro Atlanta, to be a major reliever to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world).

Dobbins ARB is the only U.S. military facility left in northern Georgia after the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommendations were enacted. The Georgia Air National Guard transferred to Robins AFB in 1996, leaving Air Force Reserve C-130s as the only Air Force flying unit at the base. The 248th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) and elements of the 151st Aviation Regiment of the Army National Guard are also based there. More units relocated to Dobbins ARB as the Georgia Army National Guard took over NAS Atlanta as the latter closed due to BRAC and became a tenant non-flying command known as Navy Operational Support Center Atlanta.

Dobbins is also the home of the U.S. Air Force Reserve&#x27;s Transportation Proficiency Center which provides accelerated training for Airmen joining the Air Force Reserve in transportation career fields, specialized skill training, and pre-mobilization readiness training for Reserve component transportation Airmen called to active duty service.

Near Dobbins ARB&#x27;s main gate stands a Wichita-built B-29 named &quot;Sweet Eloise&quot; (B-29-80-BW, AAF Ser. No. 44-70113), which is on public display as a memorial to World War II bomber production at the site. However, at least two Marietta-built B-29s have survived the years. One is on display at the Georgia Veterans State Park near Cordele (B-29A-15-BN, AAF Ser. No. 42-93967) and the other (B-29B-55-BA, AAF Ser. No. 44-84053) is located at Robins Air Force Base&#x27;s Museum of Flight in Warner Robins, Georgia.

<text>Maha Shivaratri is a Hindu festival celebrated annually in honour of the deity Shiva, between February and March. According to the Hindu calendar, the festival is observed on the fourteenth day of the first half (night start with darkness - waning) of the lunar month of Phalguna. The festival commemorates the wedding of Shiva and Parvati, and the occasion that Shiva performs his divine dance, called the Tandava.

It is a notable festival in Hinduism, marking a remembrance of &quot;overcoming darkness and ignorance&quot; in life and the world. It is observed by remembering Shiva and chanting prayers, fasting, and meditating on ethics and virtues such as honesty, non-injury to others, charity, forgiveness, and the discovery of Shiva. Ardent devotees stay awake throughout this night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on a pilgrimage to the Jyotirlingams. The festival is believed to have originated in 5th century BCE.

In Kashmir Shaivism, the festival is called Har-ratri or phonetically simpler Haerath or Herath by Shiva devotees of the Kashmir region.

==Description==

Maha Shivaratri is particularly important in the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism. Unlike most Hindu festivals that are celebrated during the day, Maha Shivaratri is celebrated at night. Furthermore, unlike most Hindu festivals that include expression of cultural revelry, Maha Shivaratri is a solemn event notable for its introspective focus, fasting, meditation on Shiva, self study, social harmony and an all-night vigil at Shiva temples.

The celebration includes maintaining a jagarana, an all-night vigil and prayers, because Shaiva Hindus mark this night as &quot;overcoming darkness and ignorance&quot; in one&#x27;s life and the world through Shiva. Offerings of fruits, leaves, sweets and milk are made to Shiva, some perform all-day fasting with Vedic or Tantric worship of Shiva, and some perform meditative yoga. In Shiva temples, the sacred Panchakshara mantra of Shiva, &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot; is chanted throughout the day. Devotees praise Shiva through the recitation of the hymn called the Shiva Chalisa.

==Legend and significance==
The Maha Shivaratri is mentioned in several Puranas, particularly the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, &quot;Linga Purana,&quot; and &quot;Padma Purana&quot;. These medieval era Shaiva texts present different versions associated with this festival, such as fasting, and offering reverence to a lingaman emblematic figure of Shiva.

Different legends describe the significance of Maha Shivaratri. According to one legend in the Shaivism tradition, this is the night when Shiva performs the heavenly dance of creation, preservation and destruction. The chanting of hymns, the reading of Shiva scriptures and the chorus of devotees joins this cosmic dance and remembers Shiva&#x27;s presence everywhere. According to another legend, this is the night when Shiva and Parvati got married. A different legend states the offering to Shiva icons, such as the linga, is an annual occasion to overcome any past sins, to restart on a virtuous path, and thereby reach Mount Kailasha for liberation. It is also believed that on this particular day, Shiva gulped the Halahala produced during the Samudra Manthana and held it in his neck, which bruised and turned blue. As a result, he acquired the epithet Nilakantha. It is also believed that the famous Neelkanth Mahadev Temple is the place where this incident took place.

The significance of dance tradition to this festival has historical roots. The Maha Shivaratri has served as a historic confluence of artists for annual dance festivals at major Hindu temples such as at Konark, Khajuraho, Pattadakal, Modhera and Chidambaram. This event is called &quot;Natyanjali&quot;, literally &quot;worship through dance&quot;, at the Chidambaram temple which is famous for its sculpture depicting all dance mudras in the ancient Hindu text of performance arts called &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. Similarly, at Khajuraho Shiva temples, a major fair and dance festival on Maha Shivaratri, involving Shaiva pilgrims camped over miles around the temple complex, was documented by Alexander Cunningham in 1864.

==Worship ==
=== India ===

Maha Shivaratri is celebrated in Tamil Nadu with great pomp and fanfare in the Annamalaiyar temple located in Tiruvannamalai district. The special process of worship on this day is Girivalam or Giri Pradakshina, a 14-kilometer bare foot walk around Shiva&#x27;s temple on top of the hill. A huge lamp of oil and camphor is lit on the hilltop at sunset - not to be confused with Karthigai Deepam. A ritual marathon is undertaken by the devotees to the 12 Shiva shrines in the district of Kanyakumari on the day of Shivaratri called Sivalaya Ottam. In recent years, the Isha Foundation has been a major patron of such festivities in India, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi having attended the celebration hosted at the site of the Giant Adiyogi in Coimbatore.

The major Jyotirlinga Shiva temples of India, such as in Varanasi and Somanatha, are particularly frequented on Maha Shivaratri. They serve also as sites for fairs and special events.

In Karnataka, Mahashivaratri is one of the most important festivals that is celebrated with much grandeur. The ardent worshippers stay awake all night and visit temples to take part in the rituals. Popular temple destinations such as Dharmasthala, Murudeshwara, Gokarna, Nanjangud, Male Madeshwara Hills, Kadu Malleshwara, Kotilingeshwara, Mylaralingeshwara among others are thronged with devotees across the state and other neighbouring states. The Isha Foundation&#x27;s festivities are replicated at the Adiyogi Shiva temple at Chikkaballapur which was inaugurated on 15 January 2023.

In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, special pujas are held at Pancharamas - Amararamam of Amaravati, Somaramam of Bhimavaram, Draksharamam, Kumararama of Samarlakota and Ksheerarama of Palakollu. The days immediately after Shivaratri are celebrated as Brahmotsavaalu at Srisailam, one of 12 Jyotirlinga sites. Mahashivaratri utsavalu are held at the Rudreshwara Swamy&#x27;s 1000 pillar temple in Warangal. Devotees throng for the special poojas at Srikalahasti, Mahanandi, Yaganti, Antarvedi, Kattamanchi, Pattiseema, Bhairavakona, Hanamkonda, Keesaragutta, Vemulawada, Panagal, Kolanupaka among others. Shivaratri yatras are held at Mallayya gutta near Kambhalapalle, Gundlakamma Kona near Railway Koduru, Penchalakona, Bhairavakona, Uma Maheswaram among others.

The Mandi fair is in the town of Mandi is particularly famous as a venue for Maha Shivaratri celebrations. It is believed that all gods and goddesses of the area, said to number more than 200, assemble here on the day of Maha Shivaratri. Mandi, located on the banks of Beas, is popularly known as the &quot;Cathedral of Temples&quot; and one of the oldest towns of Himachal Pradesh, with about 81 temples of different deities on its periphery.

In Kashmir Shaivism, Maha Shivaratri is celebrated by the Hindus of Kashmir and is called, &quot;Herath&quot; in Kashmiri, a word derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Hararatri&quot; the &quot;Night of Hara&quot; (another name of Shiva). Shivaratri, regarded as the most important festival of the community, for instance, is celebrated by them on trayodashi or the thirteenth of the dark half of the month of Phalguna (February–March) and not on the chaturdashi or the fourteenth as in the rest of the country. The reason for it is that this long drawn festival that is celebrated for one full fortnight as an elaborate ritual is associated with the appearance of Bhairava (Shiva) as a jvala-linga or a linga of flame. It has been described as Bhairavotsava in Tantric texts as on this occasion Bhairava and Bhairavi, his Shakti or cosmic energy, are propitiated through Tantric worship.

According to the legend associated with the origin of the worship, the linga appeared at pradoshakala or the dusk of early night as a blazing column of fire and dazzled Vatuka Bhairava and Rama (or Ramana) Bhairava, Mahadevi&#x27;s mind-born sons, who approached it to discover its beginning or end but miserably failed. Exasperated and terrified they began to sing its praises and went to Mahadevi, who herself merged with the awe-inspiring jvala-linga. The Goddess blessed both Vatuka and Ramana that they would be worshipped by human beings and would receive their share of sacrificial offerings on that day and those who would worship them would have all their wishes fulfilled. As Vatuka Bhairava emerged from a pitcher full of water after Mahadevi cast a glance into it, fully armed with all his weapons (and so did Rama), he is represented by a pitcher full of water in which walnuts are kept for soaking and worshipped along with Shiva, Parvati, Kumara, Ganesha, their ganas or attendant deities, yoginis and kshetrapalas (guardians of the quarters) – all represented by clay images. The soaked walnuts are later distributed as naivedya. The ceremony is called &#x27;vatuk barun&#x27; in Kashmiri, which means filling the pitcher of water representing the Vatuka Bhairava with walnuts and worshipping it.

Central India has a large number of Shaiva followers. The Mahakaleshwar Temple, Ujjain is one of the most venerated shrines consecrated to Shiva, where a large congregation of devotees gathers to offer prayers on the day of Maha Shivaratri. Tilwara Ghat in the city of Jabalpur and the Math Temple in the village of Jeonara, Seoni are two other places where the festival is celebrated with much religious fervour.

In Punjab, Shobha Yatras would be organised by various Hindu organisations in different cities. It is a grand festival for Punjabi Hindus.

In Gujarat, Maha Shivaratri mela is held at Bhavnath near Junagadh where bathing in the Mrugi (Mrigi) kund is considered holy. According to myth, Shiva himself comes to bath in the Mrugi kund.

In West Bengal, Maha Shivaratri is observed devoutly by unmarried girls and boys seeking a suitable husband or wife, often visiting Tarakeswar.

In Odisha, Maha Shivaratri is also known as &quot;Jagara&quot;. People fast for their wishes whole day and take food after &#x27;Mahadipa&#x27; (The great diya) rises at the top of Shiva temple. It usually is held during midnight. Unmarried girls also worship for seeking a suitable husband.

=== Nepal ===

Maha Shivaratri is a national holiday in Nepal and celebrated widely in temples all over the country, especially in the Pashupatinath temple. Thousands of devotees visit the famous Shiva Shakti Peetham nearby as well. Holy rituals are performed all over the nation. Maha Shivaratri is celebrated as Nepali Army Day amid a spectacular ceremony held at the Army Pavilion, Tundikhel. In the capital city of Kathmandu, there is a provision of road blockage where children use ropes and strings to stop the people or vehicle passing through in exchange of money. Worshippers of Shiva stay up all night and some also smoke marijuana as Shiva is believed to be an avid smoker and marijuana smoking on this day is called taking ‘Shivako Prasad’ or ‘Shiva Buti’ literally the &quot;Blessing of Shiva&quot;. Crowds of sadhus and saints travel to Pashupatinath Temple located in Kathmandu from all of Nepal and neighbouring India to celebrate the day and perform puja on this day.

=== Pakistan ===
Another major temple where Shivaratri is celebrated is the Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple in Karachi whose Shivaratri festival is attended by 25,000 people. On the Shivaratri night, Hindus in Karachi fast and visit the temple. Later, devotees from the Chanesar Goth come to the temple carrying water from the holy river Ganges, in order to bathe the idol of Shiva. Puja is performed until 5 am, when an aarti is then done. Devotees then walk barefoot with women carrying a pooja thali containing flowers, incense sticks, rice, coconut and a diya to the sea after which they are free to break their fast. They eat breakfast later on, which was made in the temple kitchen.

=== Outside South Asia ===
Maha Shivaratri is the main Hindu festival among the Shaiva Hindu diaspora from Nepal and India. In Indo-Caribbean communities, thousands of Hindus spend the beautiful night in over four hundred temples across multiple countries, offering special &quot;jhalls&quot; (an offering of milk and curd, flowers, sugarcane and sweets) to Shiva. In Mauritius, Hindus go on pilgrimage to Ganga Talao, a crater-lake.

==Fasting==

Fasting and meditation is recommended for Hindus during Maha Shivaratri. Those fasting may engage in &quot;nirjala vrat,&quot; or fasting from all food and water, or fast from meat, eating only fruits and milk during the day.

In Shaivism, fasting is traditionally associated with Shiva worship. It is customary for the devotees of Shiva not to eat anything until they worship him and make him offerings. On most of the days, they do not have to fast for a whole day because the worship is performed in the early morning. However, on the day of Maha Shivaratri, they have to wait because the worship continues late into the night.

Devotees break the fast between sunrise and before the end of Chaturdashi Tithi.

<text>Drafting or slipstreaming is an aerodynamic technique where two moving objects are aligning in a close group to exploit the lead object&#x27;s slipstream and thus reduce the overall effect of drag. Especially when high speeds are involved, as in motor racing and cycling, drafting can significantly reduce the paceline&#x27;s average energy expenditure and can even slightly reduce the energy expenditure of the lead vehicle.

==Drafting in sport==
Drafting is used to reduce wind resistance and is seen most commonly in bicycle racing, motorcycle racing, car racing, and speedskating, though drafting is occasionally used even in cross-country skiing, downhill skateboarding, and running. Some forms of triathlon allow drafting. Drafting occurs in swimming as well: both in open-water races (occurring in natural bodies of water) and in traditional races in competition pools. In a competition pool a swimmer may hug the lane line that separates them from the swimmer they are abaft of thereby taking advantage of the liquid slipstream in the other swimmer&#x27;s wake. Drafting also occurs in competitive longboarding.

It is believed, but not yet conclusively proven, that thoroughbred racing horses draft each other, especially in longer races.
===Cycling===

In cycling, any time one bicyclist is riding behind another, energy is conserved, especially at higher speeds.

In road bicycle racing, the main (largest) group of tightly packed cyclists in a race is called a &quot;peloton&quot; where cyclists ride in a long formation with each (but not the first rider) drafting behind the others before them.

When cyclists ride fast they form a &quot;paceline&quot;. Each cyclist, except the first, is drafting behind another one. In order to ride very fast, a team of some skilled cyclists may form the &quot;Belgian tourniquet&quot;. Successively, each cyclist leads the group. Drafting can be &quot;cooperative&quot;: several competitors take turns in the lead position (which requires the most effort and energy consumption). It can also be &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;tactical&quot;: one competitor will try to stay closely behind another, leaving the follower with more energy for a break-away push to the finish line.

===Running===
Drafting behind another runner can conserve energy when facing a headwind. Generally the effect is much less pronounced than in cycling due to lower speeds.

Nike worked with the aerodynamics expert Robby Ketchell at the University of New Hampshire to experiment with and select a formation of pacemakers that would best minimize drag on the professionals it sponsored in the project it termed Breaking2. A &quot;Wired&quot; magazine report that interviewed various experts affiliated and unaffiliated with Nike found they universally expected more coordinated pacing efforts to occur in running after Breaking2, with two of the quoted experts predicting that behavior like &quot;cooperative drafting&quot;, or races that incentivize cycling-peloton-like behavior could improve running times.

===Motorsport===
====Road racing====
In single seater, open wheel racing series such as Formula One and the IndyCar Series, as well as to a lesser extent in sports car racing, a technique known as &quot;slipstreaming&quot; is used. Along a long straight a car following close behind another uses the slipstream created by the lead car to close the gap between them, hoping to be able to overtake the leader under braking for the next corner, or if they have a straightline speed advantage, to pass on the straight. However it is very difficult for cars to follow each other close together in fast corners as the &quot;dirty&quot; (turbulent) air that comes off the lead car unbalances the trailing car as its aerodynamic devices provide less grip.

====Stock car racing====

On the faster speedways and superspeedways used by NASCAR and ARCA, two or more vehicles can race faster when lined up front-to-rear than a single car can race alone. The low-pressure wake behind a group&#x27;s leading car reduces the aerodynamic resistance on the front of the trailing car, allowing the second car to pull closer. As the second car nears the first, it pushes high-pressure air forward so less fast-moving air hits the lead car&#x27;s spoiler. The result is less drag for both cars, allowing faster speeds.

Handling in corners is affected by balance changes caused by the draft: the leading car has normal front downforce but less rear downforce. The trailing car has less front downforce but normal rear downforce. A car with drafting partners both ahead and behind will lose downforce at both ends.

Similar to the &quot;Belgian tourniquet&quot; in cycling, the &quot;slingshot pass&quot; is the most dramatic and widely noted maneuver associated with drafting. A trailing car (perhaps pushed by a line of drafting cars) uses the lead car&#x27;s wake to pull up with maximum momentum at the end of a straightaway, enters a turn high, and turns down across the lead car&#x27;s wake. The combination of running downhill and running across the zone of lowest aerodynamic drag allows the trailing car to carry extra speed and pass on the inside of the leader.

Drafting was discovered by stock car racers in the 1960 Daytona 500, when Junior Johnson found that he could use drafting as a strategy that helped him overcome the fact that his Chevrolet could not keep up with other cars, allowing him to win the race. Like Johnson, other drivers found they picked up speed running closely behind other cars, and as they experimented, they found that a line of cars could sustain higher speeds and/or use less fuel (resulting in fewer pit-stops) than a single car running by itself.

In recent years, as aerodynamics have become increasingly critical to the performance of stock cars on &quot;intermediate&quot; oval tracks (between 1.33 and 2 mi) and superspeedways not requiring restrictor plates (such as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway), the effect of turbulent, or &quot;dirty&quot;, air when following closely behind another car has become much more akin to that described above in open-wheel racing (a situation described in NASCAR circles as &quot;aero push&quot;), and is often cited as a main reason for a decrease in the amount of overtakes.

====Bump drafting====
Drafting is most important at NASCAR&#x27;s restrictor plate tracks, Talladega Superspeedway, Daytona International Speedway, and Atlanta Motor Speedway where the plates mean that much less power is available to push the large bodies through the air. Race cars reach their highest speeds on these superspeedways, so the aerodynamic forces are highest and the effects of drafting are strongest. Since restrictor plates were first used as a safety device, their effect has changed the nature of drafting. Vehicles no longer have sufficient horsepower or throttle response to maintain their drafting speeds upon exiting the draft; they can pull out and squeeze ahead but lack the response to clear the car being passed. This negates the slingshot maneuver. As a result, passing is often the result of cooperation between two or more drivers or is achieved by sucking air off the side of the car being passed, a technique called side-drafting.

Bump drafting is a tactic used at Talladega and Daytona. The technique was initially popularized by the Archer Brothers in the SCCA Sportruck series during the late 1980s. It begins as normal drafting, but the following car pulls up behind the lead car and bumps into the rear of it, pushing the lead car ahead, to maintain momentum.

If done roughly or in the wrong position (e.g. close to the entry of the turn), this tactic can destabilize the handling of the lead car, sometimes causing a crash. Use of the tactic in this manner is known as &quot;slam drafting&quot;. Due to the danger, NASCAR has attempted to limit the bracing on bumpers on cars, disallowed bump drafting in turns, introduced &quot;no bump zones&quot; on certain portions of speedways where this practice is prevalent, and penalized drivers who are too rough in bump drafting. The 2010 NASCAR season allowed drivers more freedom; bump drafting was allowed anywhere, including turns.

Kyle Busch is largely responsible for a different type of bump drafting, which is now referred to as &quot;two-car drafting&quot; and &quot;tandem drafting&quot;. At a 2007 test session in Talladega, he asked Ryan Newman to push him from behind, and was stunned to realize he was two seconds faster with Newman&#x27;s help. At the newly paved Daytona International Speedway in 2011, Busch was the first to realize that the corners were smooth enough to allow a two-car draft for the complete length of the track. During test sessions on the track, when Busch was pushed by his brother Kurt&#x27;s Penske Racing teammate Brad Keselowski, they ran 15 mph faster than single cars. Other drivers quickly picked up on Busch&#x27;s strategy, and the two-car draft dominated the 2011 Daytona 500 and Budweiser Shootout. This strategy had also been very prominent at Talladega. In 2011, two-car tandem drafting was used for the extent of the Aaron&#x27;s 499, with many drivers drafting their own teammates (e.g., Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. drafted together, as did Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin). For the 2012 season, the Sprint Cup series cars were modified in a way that made the tandem impossible, in order to return to pack racing. In 2014, bump drafting was banned by NASCAR in the Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series. Tandem drafting made a return when NASCAR removed the restrictor plate and replaced them with tapered spacers, and with the flat noses and bumpers of the modern Gen 6 cars, drivers could more easily tandem and gain speed, much like the early 2010s. After Ryan Newman&#x27;s scary crash in the 2020 Daytona 500, NASCAR made efforts to change drafting at superspeedways, where less horsepower was used: the removal of aero ducts to eliminate tandem drafting and decrease closing rates, and a smaller throttle body to lower the amount of air into a racecar.

==Tailgating and hypermiling==
Some drivers have been known to draft behind other vehicles, particularly tailgating larger vehicles, to save fuel. For example, hypermilers using this technique can achieve 75 mpg or more (a 10% increase in efficiency of certain hybrid vehicles). Some sources say that the most common tailgating does not save gasoline even at freeway speeds because one is likely to accelerate and brake so frequently that any aerodynamic savings are lost through the brakes.

On the show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, drafting behind an 18-wheeler truck was tested and results showed that traveling behind the truck increased overall mpg efficiency by 11%. Traveling behind the truck produced a 39% gain in efficiency. Additionally, on the same episode, &quot;MythBusters&quot; demonstrated that it can be very dangerous for the following car if one of the truck&#x27;s tires (or their recaps) delaminate, as the chunks of ejected rubber can be large enough to cause serious harm, even death, to a driver following too closely.

Drafters also face the danger that, if the vehicle in front stops suddenly, there is little time to react. Platooning is under study as a means to get the benefit while also increasing safety.

==Computer simulation of drafting==
Computer simulation (computational fluid dynamics or CFD) is increasingly being used to analyse drafting. It is important to understand the aerodynamic behaviour of a motor vehicle when drafting, for example if the rear car is too close to the front car, the air supply to its radiator will be reduced and there is a possibility of the engine overheating. Most motor sport aerodynamic analysis is performed using wind tunnel testing. This becomes difficult for drafting cases, if only because a very large wind tunnel is needed. CFD, a kind of virtual wind tunnel, is used by race teams to understand the car&#x27;s performance while drafting.

Racing games, such as most in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, simulate drafting by giving the player a speed boost.

== Drafting in nature ==
Animals have been observed to use true drafting behavior reminiscent of auto racing or cycling. Caribbean spiny lobsters for example are known to migrate in close single-file formation &quot;lobster trains&quot;.

==Vortex surfing==
Vortex surfing is a related phenomenon that is currently being investigated by the US Air Force to save fuel on long-distance flights. The idea is to fly aircraft in the upward part of the wingtip vortex of a leading aircraft. In 2003, NASA said one of its F/A-18 test aircraft had a 29% fuel savings by flying in the wingtip vortex of a DC-8. The DC-8/F-18 flight was an exploratory investigation of large aircraft vortex-induced performance benefits on a fighter-type aircraft. The aircraft flew at 25,000 feet with a separation of about 200 feet nose-to-tail. The F/A-18 slowly moved in laterally to explore the vortex effects, NASA said at the time. The Air Force has also tested vortex surfing with C-17s using auto pilot in 2012, and indicated a 10% fuel saving. Tests in 2013 produced even greater fuel savings.

==Vortex surfing in nature==

Cooperative fluid dynamics techniques like drafting are also found in nature. Flocks of geese and some other birds fly in a V formation because the wingtip vortices generated by the front bird will create up-wash circulations. The birds flying behind will receive lift force from these up-wash vortices. Thus other birds in the flock do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory.

<text>The M39 cannon is a 20 mm caliber single-barreled revolver cannon developed for the United States Air Force in the late 1940s. It was used on a number of fighter aircraft from the early 1950s through the 1980s.

==Development==
The M39 was developed by the Springfield Armory, based on the World War II–era design of the German Mauser MG 213, a 20 mm (and 30 mm) cannon developed for the Luftwaffe, which did not see combat use. The same design inspired the 30mm British ADEN cannon and the French DEFA, but American designers chose a smaller 20 mm round to increase the weapon&#x27;s rate of fire and muzzle velocity at the expense of hitting power. The 20×102mm round was later chosen by France for the M621 cannon.

Initially designated the T-160, the new gun was installed for combat testing on a number of F-86 Sabre aircraft under the &quot;GunVal&quot; program in late 1952, and used in action over Korea in early 1953. The results of the program were startling, with the GUNVAL F-86F&#x27;s having downed 6 MIG fighters and damaged 12 others. This signaled the end of the M3 .50 caliber as the preferred fighter weapon system ongoing. It was subsequently adopted as standard armament of the F-86H fighter-bomber, F-100 Super Sabre, F-101A and F-101C Voodoo, and the F-5 Freedom Fighter. The M39 was also used on the B-57B tactical bomber. Current models of the F-5 Tiger II still use the M39A2 version of this weapon. The M39A2 was introduced in 1964.

The weapon is gas operated and consists of a five–chamber magazine running parallel to the barrel. Sealing was provided by a forcing cone that was pressed into the barrel. The sealing movement was at no time more than 1/4&quot;. A feeder mechanism ensured the proper placement of the rounds for ramming. This was powered by a feeder shaft that received kinetic force via the rotating magazine drum. This in turn was powered by propellant gas. The exterior of the 5-cylinder drum was studded with bearings that acted on a shifting cam located below the rammer/extractor platform. The gun could be set up for either right- or left-hand feed by switching the feeder head around. Some 35,000 were produced before being superseded by the M61 cannon which outperformed the M39 in almost every way. The only US aircraft still flying with the M39 is the Northrop F-5, an aircraft now only used for training. Extensive work had to be done on the forcing cone, heat dissipation, cook-off prevention, link testing, and reinforcement, to raise the mean time between failures to 1-in-1000 rounds fired. Four arms manufacturers, three independent companies, and a university research department, were involved in getting the weapon working correctly.

In Vietnam in 1967 the 116th Assault Helicopter Company operating out of Củ Chi Base Camp used the M39 mounted inverted on the forward hardpoints on the underside of a UH-1 helicopter, with ammunition feed out the left cargo door through a chute. The unit&#x27;s report for May through July 1967 states &quot;A low-level type of attack has been used on bunker lines with a good deal of success. It consists of locating and pinpointing the target area, then turning out, dropping down to about 50 feet [] (at 120 knots []) and when about 500 meters from the target, popping up to about 150 feet [], turning hell, death and destruction onto the target, turning off, and being gone before Charlie recovers from the shock...It is most effective on huts or heavily wooded tree lines. A hut is almost totally destroyed, i.e., to the point of setting it on fire and reducing it to ashes, and a tree line is so effectively covered that many of the trees are defoliated or limbs, etc., blown off. In situations where the enemy is using less than bunker-type cover, the 20mm coverage is so effective that it is quite reasonable to assume that those individuals who were in the area are either dead or severely wounded.&quot; As to the ammunition, the same unit report says, &quot;The ammunition is M-56AZ high explosive incendiary #12 link. It weighs almost one pound per round and has a bursting radius of 9 meters. It is spin-actuated at about 50 meters. It detonates upon contact with anything.&quot;

While a major leap forward in aircraft armament, all revolver cannon suffer from the effects of barrel wear, heat dissipation, and parts life. The final improved version of the M39 had barrel changes mandated at 4000 rounds. The system would be replaced by the M61 Vulcan in aircraft for this and MTBF as well as weight considerations.

==T-75 cannon==
The M39 served as the basis for the T-75 autocannon developed by Taiwan (Republic of China), as a more-powerful partial replacement for the M2HB machine gun onboard naval vessels and the HMMWV tactical vehicle, with its latest use being within the XTR-101 and XTR-102 weapon stations.

<doc id="1080565" wikidata="Q2725025" url="?curid=1080565" title="Phalguna">
<text>Phagun () is a month of the Hindu calendar. In India&#x27;s national civil calendar, Phalguna is the twelfth month of the year and corresponds with March/April in the Gregorian calendar.

In Luni-Solar calendars, Phaguna may begin on either the new moon or the full moon around the same time of year and is the twelfth month of the year. However, in Gujarat, Kartika is the first month of the year, and so Phaguna follows as the fifth month for Gujaratis. The holidays of Holi (15 Phaguna in Amanta System/30 Phaguna In Purnimanta System) and Maha Shivaratri (14th Phaguna in Purnimanta System) are observed in this month.

In the Vikram Samvat calendar, Phaguna is the year&#x27;s eleventh month.

In solar religious calendars, Pha
guna begins with the Sun&#x27;s entry into Pisces and is the twelfth month of the solar year.

In the Vaishnava calendar, Govinda governs this month. Gaura-purnima celebrating the birth of the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534) also falls in this month.

==Festivals==
Most parts of North India see the early celebration of the famous Hindu festival Holi in this month. Holi is celebrated at the end of the winter season on the last full moon day of the lunar month Phalguna (&quot;Phalguna Purnima&quot;), which usually falls in the later part of February or March.

The Hindu festival of Shigmo is also celebrated in Goa and Konkan in the month of Phalguna. Celebrations can stretch over a month and may last even after the Hindu Luni-Solar New Year begins. Another popular fair is Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji in Rajasthan.

<text>The A426 road is a road in England which runs from the city of Leicester to the market town of Southam in Warwickshire via the towns of Lutterworth and Rugby.

==History==

Until the M1 motorway was completed in the 1960s this route formed the main route between Rugby and Leicester, now much quieter as all but local traffic uses the motorway. However, the local traffic has increased as Magna Park, a prominent East Midlands warehouse facility, has developed close to Lutterworth. Broughton Astley, a couple of miles north-west of Dunton Bassett and other local villages can often become congested with goods vehicles en route between Magna Park, the M1 motorway and the M6 Motorway. At rush hours the road can become gridlocked and reduced to less than 40 mph, particularly as agricultural traffic frequently uses the stretch. For this reason, journeys between Blaby and Rugby during rush hour can take much longer than anticipated.

The A426 crosses the route of the former A45 in Dunchurch, this would have formed one of the main routes between the Midlands and South East. Dunchurch is now bypassed to the South by the M45 motorway, and the A426 no longer meets the A45

==Route==

The A426 starts on the Leicester Inner Ring Road, heading South through the suburbs of the city, crossing the Outer Ring Road and bypassing the village of Blaby. It crosses over the M1 which it runs parallel to for the next or so. The road becomes rural in nature until entering the small town of Lutterworth and crossing the A4303 Southern Bypass. A further south and it crosses the A5 Watling Street at a roundabout and eventually the M6 junction 1. It starts a descent into Rugby as a dual carriageway with 5 local access roundabouts. Approaching the Town Centre the road becomes single carriageway again and crosses under the West Coast Main Line. It passes the main Town Centre to the West and heads Southwards out of the town towards Dunchurch after which it passes over the M45 and once again becomes a rural road for its final length to terminate on the A423 Southam bypass.

==Former routes==
The A426, compared to other routes is a relatively untouched road, with only a single bypass:
* The road used to travel through the village of Blaby, now bypassed

==Bus corridor==
A controversial decision to allow a bus corridor to be constructed on the A426 from Blaby into Leicester was given the go ahead despite heavy local opposition.

<text>Chaitra () is a month of the Hindu calendar.

In the standard Hindu calendar and India&#x27;s national civil calendar, Chaitra is the first month of the year. It is the last month in the Bengali calendar, where it is called Choitro. Chaitra or Chait is also the last month in the Nepali calendar (the Vikram Samvat), where it commences in mid-March. Chittirai is the first month in the Tamil calendar. In the Sindhi calendar, this month is referred to as Chet and is marked by the celebration of the Cheti Chand (birth of Jhulelal, an incarnation of Vishnu). In the Vaishnava calendar, Vishnu governs this month. In solar religious calendars, Chaitra begins with the Sun&#x27;s entry into Aries.

In the more traditional reckoning, the first month commences in March or April of the Gregorian calendar, depending upon whether the adhika masa (extra month for alignment of lunar or solar calendar) was observed in the year. The first day of Chaitra is marked as the , the Hindu lunar new year.

According to Jain texts, Mahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the moon in the month of &quot;Chaitra&quot; in the year 599 BCE (Chaitra Sud 13). So Jains celebrate Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, one of the most important religious festivals in Jainism during Chaitra

The month of &quot;Chaitra&quot; is also associated with the departure of spring. Holi, the Hindu spring festival of colours, is celebrated on the full moon day (Purnima) of Phalguna, the month before &quot;Chaitra&quot;, exactly six days after which the Chaiti form of the Chhath festival is observed.

In &quot;Chandramana&quot; (lunar) religious calendars, Chaitra begins with the new moon in March−April and is the first month of the year. The nine-day festival Chaitra Navratri or Navadurga (or &quot;Nava Durga&quot;, the &#x27;nine forms of the Goddess Durga&#x27;) starts from &quot;Chaitra Shukla Pratipada&quot;. The first day of month Chaitra is celebrated as Hindu New Year&#x27;s Day, known as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Puthandu in Tamil Nadu and Ugadi in Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. In West Bengal, Basanti Puja, Annapurna Puja, Ram Nabami, Neel Puja and Chorok Puja ( &#x27;Gajon&#x27;) are held consecutively before the beginning of Bengali New Year on Poila Baishakh.

<text>Abraham Elieser Adolph Schönberg (May 12, 1868 – August 12, 1949), known as Al Shean, was a comedian and vaudeville performer. Other sources give his birth name variously as Adolf Schönberg, Albert Schönberg, or Alfred Schönberg. He is most remembered for being half of the vaudeville team Gallagher and Shean, and as the uncle of the Marx Brothers (Leonard Joseph &quot;Chico&quot; Marx, Adolph (Arthur) &quot;Harpo&quot; Marx, Julius Henry &quot;Groucho&quot; Marx, Milton &quot;Gummo&quot; Marx and Herbert Manfred &quot;Zeppo&quot; Marx).

==Biography==

Shean was born in Dornum, Kingdom of Prussia on May 12, 1868, the son of Fanny and Levi or Louis Schoenberg. His father was a magician. His sister, Minnie, married Sam &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marx; their sons would become known as the Marx Brothers.

After making a name for himself in vaudeville, Shean teamed up with Edward Gallagher to create the act Gallagher and Shean. While the act was successful, the men apparently did not like each other much. After their act&#x27;s final Ziegfeld Follies pairing, Shean went on to perform solo in eight Broadway shows, even playing the title character in &quot;Father Malachy&#x27;s Miracle&quot;.

Shean had some solo film roles: as the piano player, known as &quot;The Professor&quot; in &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936), as grandfather in &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1940), as a priest in &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot; (1943), and in some three dozen other films. He and Gallagher also made an early sound film at the Theodore Case studio in Auburn, New York, in 1925.

He died on August 12, 1949.
==Legacy==
Shean&#x27;s son, also named Al Shean, worked on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;.

Shean is reputed to have written the Marx Brothers&#x27; first (moderately) successful vaudeville sketch on butcher paper at Minnie and Frenchie&#x27;s kitchen table one night while he was visiting.

<text>Vaisakha (, ) is a month of the Hindu calendar that corresponds to April/May in the Gregorian Calendar. In the Indian national calendar, Vaisakha is the second month of the year. It is the first month of the Vikram Samvat calendar, Odia calendar, Maithili Calendar, Punjabi calendar, Assamese calendar (where it is called &quot;Bohag&quot;) and the Bengali calendar (where it is called &quot;Boishakh&quot;). This month lies between the second half of April and the first half of May.

Regional calendars used in the Indian subcontinent have two aspects: lunar and solar. Lunar months begin with Chaitra and solar months start with Vaisakha [[Sankranti]]. However, regional calendars mark when the official new year is celebrated. In regions such as Maharashtra which begin the official new year with the commencement of the lunar year, the solar year is marked by celebrating Vaisakha Sankranti. Conversely, regions starting the new year with Vaisakha Sankranti, give prominence to the start of the lunar year in Chaitra. In the Vedic calendar, it is called Madhava, and in the Vaishnava calendar, it is called Madhushudana month.

==Overview==
In the Hindu solar calendar, Vaisakha begins in mid-April in Bengal, Mithila, Nepal, and Punjab. In Tamil Nadu, it is known as Vaikasi (mid-May to mid-June) and represents the second month of the Tamil solar calendar. The Tamil month that corresponds to Vaisakha is Chithirai (mid-April to mid-May). In the Hindu lunar calendar, Vaisakha begins with the new moon in April and represents the second month of the lunar year. The name of the month is derived from the position of the Moon near the Vishākhā constellation (&quot;Nakshatra&quot;) on the full-moon day. In the Vaishnava calendar, Madhusudana governs this month.

The month of Boishakh also marks the official start of Summer. The month is notorious for the afternoon storms called Kalboishakhi (&quot;Nor&#x27;wester&quot;). The storms usually start with strong gusts from the north-western direction at the end of a hot day and cause widespread destruction.

<text>Bad Suderode is a village and a former municipality in the district of Harz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2014, it has for administrative purposes been included as part of the municipality of Quedlinburg. It is situated in a valley in the northern part of the Harz mountains, on the road from Quedlinburg to Friedrichsbrunn.

The place is one of several spa resorts in the area. The local spring water is noted for its exceptionally high concentrations of calcium.

==History==
It was only in 1914 that Suderode was renamed Bad Suderode.

Between 1 January 2011 and 19 February 2013, Bad Suderode was also part of the municipality of Quedlinburg. However, the 2011 municipal merger was, in 2013, declared invalid by the judicial decision of a constitutional court. The leading judge explained the court decision which was based on the over-riding importance of legal clarity. The 2011 merger lacked legal clarity because of the failure of the responsible council leaders to comply with time-lines regarding a two-month notification period, which they had themselves included as a requirement for the process.

<text>Friedrichsbrunn is a village and a former municipality in the district of Harz, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 23 November 2009, it is part of the town Thale.

==History==

At the location of Friedrichsbrunn there has been a well and a resting place along the road between Quedlinburg and Nordhausen since the 11th century. In 1680, a Prussian border watch station was built at the well, which was known as the &quot;Ungetreuer Brunnen&quot; (Unfaithful Well). Between 1773 and 1775, King Friedrich the Great settled the area with 50 families and the place took the name Friedrichsbrunn.

The first tourists spent their summer here in 1884. Before World War I, two sanitoriums, three larger hotels, and numerous bed and breakfasts were built in Friedrichsbrunn and it became known as a health resort. During the world wars, these facilities were used as military hospitals.

In 1949, Friedrichsbrunn was recognized as a health and winter sports resort. Up to 1990, as many as 20,000 vacationers and patients came here each year. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, mass tourism declined.</text><links>

<doc id="1080591" wikidata="Q399634" url="?curid=1080591" title="Agrahayana">
<text>Agrahayana or Margashirsha, (, , ) is the ninth month of the Hindu calendar. In India&#x27;s national civil calendar, &quot;Agrahayana&quot; is also the eight month of the year, beginning on 16 November and ending on 15 December. Margashirsha means related to the Mrigashīrsha nakṣatra (asterism), which has been known since Vedic times. 

In lunar religious calendars, Agrahayana or Margashirsha typically begins either on the new moon or the full moon, depending on the regional tradition, and generally corresponds to the ninth month of the year.

In solar religious calendars, Agrahayana (or Margaḻi in Tamil traditions) begins with the Sun&#x27;s entry into the zodiac sign Sagittarius (Dhanus Rashi) and is considered the ninth month of the year.

==Festivals==
Vaikunta Ekadashi, observed on the Ekadashi (11th lunar day) of Margashirsha month, is celebrated also as &quot;Mokshada Ekadashi&quot;. Additionally, the 10th Canto, 22nd Chapter of Bhagavata Purana narrates a significant episode where the young, marriageable daughters of the cowherd men of Gokula (gopis) worship goddess Katyayani. During the entire Margashirsha month, considered the first month of the winter season (Śiśira Ritu), the gopis undertook a sacred vow (Vrata) with the desire to have Krishna as their husband.

Bhairava Ashtami occurs on the Krishna paksha Ashtami of this month of Margashirsha month. According to Hindu tradition, it is believed that on this day, Lord Shiva manifested in his fierce form as Bhairava on Earth. This day is commemorated with special prayers, rituals, and offerings dedicated to Bhairava, who is regarded as the protector and guardian deity. 

Margashirsha Guruvar Mahalakshmi Vrat, also known as Margashirsha Devi Vrat, is a sacred observance dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi. This fast is observed on all Thursdays of the Margashirsha month in the Hindu lunar calendar, totaling four days of devotion and prayer. The fast holds special significance, as it is associated with wealth, prosperity, mental and spiritual growth, making it ideal for invoking goddess Lakshmi’s blessings. Devotees recite powerful stotras and hymns, including the &quot;Lakshmi Ashtottara Shatanamavali&quot; (108 names of Lakshmi), the Śrī Sūkta, and the &quot;Mahalakshmi Ashtakam&quot;. In Odisha this fast is celebrated as Manabasa Gurubara. 

In Tamil Nadu, during this month of Margaḻi, women make kolams or rangoli early in the morning. Devotees usually go to temples each morning and recite Thiruppavai by Andal and Thiruvempavai by Manikkavacakar.

<text>Pausha ( ; ; ), also called Paush, Poush, Pausa or Pushya, is the tenth month of the Hindu calendar, corresponding with December/January of the Gregorian calendar. In the Indian national calendar, Pausha is also the tenth month of the year, beginning on 21 December and ending on 19 January.

In the Hindu lunisolar calendar, Pausha begins with either the full or new moon around the same time of year. Since the traditional Hindu calendar follows the lunar cycle, Pausha&#x27;s start and end dates vary from year to year, unlike the months of the Hindu solar calendars. Pausha is a winter (Hemanta and Shishira Ritu) month. The lunar month of Pausha overlaps with the solar month of Dhanu.

==Events==
Pausa Bahula Amavasya day is celebrated as Theppotsavam (float festival) at Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamyvari Temple in Simhachalam. The &quot;Utsava&quot; idols are taken in a palanquin to &quot;Varaha Pushkarini&quot;.

<text>Magha () is the eleventh month of the Hindu calendar, corresponding to January/February of the Gregorian calendar. In India&#x27;s national civil calendar, Magha is also the eleventh month of the year, beginning on 20 January and ending on 18 February.

In the Hindu lunisolar calendar, Magha may begin on either the new moon or the full moon around the same time of year. It is named thus because in this month, the full moon is usually found nearby or within the star cluster called Magha. Since the traditional Hindu calendar follows the lunar cycle, Magha&#x27;s start and end dates vary from year to year, unlike the months of the Hindu solar calendars. Magha is a winter (Shishira Ritu) month.

The lunar month of Magha overlaps with the solar month of Makara, which begins with the Sun&#x27;s entry into Capricorn.

==Festivals==
* Shukla Panchami: Vasant Panchami
* Shukla Saptami: Ratha Saptami
* Maagh Mela is an important festival celebrated by most of North India.
* The world-famous &quot;Maha Maham&quot; festival is held every 12 years during full moon day of this month of &quot;maasi&quot;.

<text>Necessary Angels is the third album by the American singer-songwriter Sara Hickman, released in 1994 (see 1994 in music).

==Critical reception==
AllMusic called the album Hickman&#x27;s &quot;boldest, most mature, and most musically sophisticated offering to date.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; called it an &quot;enormously rich album.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that Hickman &quot;eschews some of her earlier wordplay for lyrics that are cleaner and sharper ... Lovely.&quot;

<doc id="1080597" wikidata="Q17023954" url="?curid=1080597" title="Portrait of Dr. Gachet">
<text>The Portrait of Doctor Gachet is one of the most revered paintings by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet, a homeopathic doctor and artist with whom van Gogh resided following a spell in an asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Gachet took care of Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm, but they are easily differentiated in color and style. There is also an etching.

The first version was acquired by the Städel in Frankfurt in 1911 and subsequently confiscated and sold by Hermann Göring. In May 1990, under the direction of Christie&#x27;s auction house Chairman Stephen Lash, it was sold for $82.5 million ($ million today) to Ryoei Saito, making it the world&#x27;s most expensive painting at that time. It then disappeared from public view and the Städel was unable to locate it in 2019. The second version was owned by Gachet and was bequeathed to France by his heirs. Despite arguments over its authenticity, it now hangs in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, in Paris.

==Background==
In late 1888, Van Gogh began to experience a mental breakdown, cutting off part of his ear. He stayed in hospital for a month, but was not fully healed and in April 1889 he checked himself into an asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he remained for a year. Released in 1890, Van Gogh&#x27;s brother Theo searched for a home for the artist. Upon the recommendation of Camille Pissarro, a former patient of the doctor who told Theo of Gachet&#x27;s interests in working with artists, Theo sent Vincent to Gachet&#x27;s second home in Auvers.

Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s first impression of Gachet was unfavorable. Writing to Theo he remarked: &quot;I think that we must not count on Dr. Gachet at all. First of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much, so that&#x27;s that. Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don&#x27;t they both fall into the ditch?&quot; However, in a letter dated two days later to their sister Wilhelmina, he relayed, &quot;I have found a true friend in Dr. Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble each other physically and also mentally.&quot;

Van Gogh had a very prolific spell during his stay with Gachet, producing more than seventy paintings, including the portraits of Gachet.

Van Gogh&#x27;s thoughts returned several times to the painting by Eugène Delacroix of Torquato Tasso in the madhouse. After a visit with Paul Gauguin to Montpellier to see Alfred Bruyas&#x27;s collection in the Musée Fabre, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, asking if he could find a copy of the lithograph after the painting. Three and a half months earlier, he had been thinking of the painting as an example of the sort of portraits he wanted to paint: &quot;But it would be more in harmony with what Eugène Delacroix attempted and brought off in his &quot;Tasso in Prison&quot;, and many other pictures, representing a real man. Ah! portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the model in it, that is what I think must come.&quot;

Van Gogh wrote to his sister in 1890 about the painting:

The portraits of Dr. Gachet were completed just six weeks before Van Gogh shot himself and died from his wounds.

==Composition==

Van Gogh painted Gachet resting his right elbow on a red table, head in hand. Two yellow books as well as the purple medicinal herb foxglove are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a physician.

The doctor&#x27;s &quot;sensitive face&quot;, which Van Gogh wrote to Paul Gauguin carried &quot;the heartbroken expression of our time&quot;, is described by Robert Wallace as the portrait&#x27;s focus. Wallace described the ultramarine blue coat of Gachet, set against a background of hills painted a lighter blue, as highlighting the &quot;tired, pale features and transparent blue eyes that reflect the compassion and melancholy of the man.&quot; Van Gogh himself said this expression of melancholy &quot;would seem to look like a grimace to many who saw the canvas&quot;.

With the &quot;Portrait of Dr. Gachet&quot;, Van Gogh sought to create a &quot;modern portrait&quot;, which he wrote to his sister &quot;impassions me most—much, much more than all the rest of my &quot;métier&quot;.&quot; Elaborating on this quote, Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker noted &quot;... much later generations experience it not only as psychologically striking, but also as a very unconventional and &#x27;modern&#x27; portrait.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;My self-portrait is done in nearly the same way but the blue is the fine blue of the Midi, and the clothes are a light lilac,&quot; which would refer to one of his final self-portraits painted in September the year previous.

Van Gogh also wrote to Wilhelmina regarding the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 and again in February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet&#x27;s enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the artist had carried with him to the home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.

==Exhibition==
===Original version===
First sold in 1897 by Van Gogh&#x27;s sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger for 300 francs, the painting was subsequently bought by Paul Cassirer (1904), Kessler (1904), and Druet (1910). In 1911, the painting was acquired by the Städel (Städtische Galerie) in Frankfurt, Germany and hung there until 1933, when the painting was put in a hidden room. The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda confiscated the work in 1937 as part of its campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art. Hermann Göring, through his agent Sepp Angerer, sold it to Franz Koenigs in Paris, together with &quot;The Quarry of Bibemus&quot; by Cézanne and &quot;Daubigny&#x27;s Garden&quot;, also by van Gogh. In August 1939, Koenigs transported the paintings from Paris to Knoedler&#x27;s in New York. Siegfried Kramarsky fled to Lisbon in November 1939 and arrived January 1940 in New York. The paintings ended up in Kramarsky&#x27;s custody, where the work was often lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Kramarsky&#x27;s family put the painting up for auction at Christie&#x27;s New York on May 15, 1990, where it became famous for Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., paying US$82.5 million for it ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer&#x27;s commission), making it then the world&#x27;s most expensive painting. Two days later Saito bought Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Bal du moulin de la Galette&quot; for nearly as much: $78.1 million at Sotheby&#x27;s. The 75-year-old Japanese businessman commented that he would have the Van Gogh painting cremated with him after his death. Though he later said he would consider giving the painting to the Japanese government or a museum, no information has been made public about the exact location and ownership of the portrait since his death in 1996. Reports in 2007 said the painting was sold a decade earlier to the Austrian-born investment fund manager Wolfgang Flöttl. Flöttl, in turn, had reportedly been forced by financial reversals to sell the painting to parties as yet unknown. The Städel hired a private investigator to locate the painting, hoping to show it in an exhibition in 2019. It could not be found and instead the original frame still owned by the museum was put on display empty.

===Second version===
There is a second version of the portrait which was owned by Gachet himself. In the early 1950s, along with the remainder of his personal collection of Post-Impressionist paintings, it was bequeathed to the Republic of France by his heirs.

The authenticity of the second version has often come under scrutiny due to a number of factors. In a letter dated 3 June 1890 to Theo, Vincent mentions his work on the portrait, which includes &quot;... a yellow book and a foxglove plant with purple flowers.&quot; The subsequent letter sent to Wilhelmina also mentions &quot;yellow novels and a foxglove flower.&quot; As the yellow novels are absent from the second version of the painting, the letters clearly reference only the original version. Dr. Gachet, as well as his son, also named Paul, were amateur artists themselves. Along with original works, they often made copies of the Post-Impressionist paintings in the elder Gachet&#x27;s collection, which included not only works by Van Gogh, but Cézanne, Monet, Renoir and others. These copies were self-declared, and signed under the pseudonyms Paul and Louis Van Ryssel, yet the practice has thrown the entire Gachet collection into question, including the doctor&#x27;s portrait. Additionally, some critics have noted the sheer number of works to emerge from Van Gogh&#x27;s stay in Auvers, roughly eighty in seventy days, and questioned whether he painted them all himself.

Partly in response to these accusations, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, which holds the second version of the Gachet portrait as well as the other works originally owned by the doctor, held an exhibit in 1999 of his former collection. In addition to the paintings by Van Gogh and the other Post-Impressionist masters, the exhibition was accompanied by works of the elder and younger Gachet. Prior to the exhibition, the museum commissioned infrared, ultraviolet and chemical analysis of eight works each by Van Gogh, Cézanne, and the Gachets for comparison. The studies showed pigments on the Van Gogh paintings faded differently from the Gachet copies. It also emerged that the Gachet paintings were drawn with outlines and filled with paint, whereas the Van Gogh and Cézanne works were painted directly to canvas. Van Gogh also used the same rough canvas for all his paintings at Auvers, with the exception of &quot;The Church at Auvers&quot; (whose authenticity has never been questioned).
In addition to scientific evidence, defenders say that while the second version of the &quot;Portrait of Dr. Gachet&quot; is often considered to be of lesser quality than many of Van Gogh&#x27;s works in Arles, it is superior in technique to anything painted by either the elder or younger Gachet.

Dutch scholar J. B. de la Faille, who compiled the first exhaustive catalog of Van Gogh works in 1928, noted in his manuscript, &quot;We consider this painting a very weak replica of the preceding one, missing the piercing look&quot; of the original. Editors of the posthumous 1970 edition of Faille&#x27;s book disagreed with his assessment, stating they considered both works to be of high quality.

===Etching===
Van Gogh, introduced to etching by Gachet, made the etching &quot;Portrait of Doctor Gachet&quot; in 1890. Gachet and Van Gogh discussed creating a series of southern France themes but that never happened. This was the one and only etching, also known as &quot;L&#x27;homme à la pipe&quot; (Man with a pipe), that Van Gogh ever made. Van Gogh&#x27;s brother, Theo, who received an impression of the etching, called it &quot;a true painter&#x27;s etching. No refinement in the execution, but a drawing on metal.&quot; It is a different pose than that in Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Dr. Gachet&quot;, owned by Musée d&#x27;Orsay. The National Gallery of Canada finds that &quot;The undulating flow of the line is typical of the expressive quality of Van Gogh&#x27;s late style.&quot; The impression owned by the National Gallery is from one of the 60 printings following Van Gogh&#x27;s death by Dr. Gachet&#x27;s son, Paul Gachet Jr. Gachet&#x27;s collector&#x27;s stamp appears on the bottom edge of the print.

<doc id="1080619" wikidata="Q1371439" url="?curid=1080619" title="Mixed-excitation linear prediction">
<text>Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP) is a United States Department of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices. Its standardization and later development was led and supported by the NSA and NATO. The current &quot;enhanced&quot; version is known as MELPe.

==History==
The initial MELP was invented by Alan McCree around 1995 while a graduate student at the Center for Signal and Image Processing (CSIP) at Georgia Tech, and the original MELP related patents have expired by now. That initial speech coder was standardized in 1997 and was known as MIL-STD-3005. It surpassed other candidate vocoders in the US DoD competition, including: (a) Frequency Selective Harmonic Coder (FSHC), (b) Advanced Multi-Band Excitation (AMBE), (c) Enhanced Multiband Excitation (EMBE), (d) Sinusoid Transform Coder (STC), and (e) Subband LPC Coder (SBC). Due to its lower complexity than Waveform Interpolative (WI) coder, the MELP vocoder won the DoD competition and was selected for MIL-STD-3005.

===MIL-STD-3005===
Between 1998 and 2001, a new MELP-based vocoder was created at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bit/s), and substantial enhancements were added to the MIL-STD-3005 by SignalCom (later acquired by Microsoft), Compandent, and AT&amp;T Corporation, which included (a) additional new vocoder at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bit/s), (b) substantially improved encoding (analysis), (c) substantially improved decoding (synthesis), (d) Noise-Preprocessing for removing background noise, (e) transcoding between the 2400 bit/s and 1200 bit/s bitstreams, and (f) new postfilter. This fairly significant development was aimed to create a new coder at half the rate and have it interoperable with the old MELP standard. This enhanced-MELP (also known as MELPe) was adopted as the new MIL-STD-3005 in 2001 in form of annexes and supplements made to the original MIL-STD-3005, enabling the same quality as the old 2400 bit/s MELP&#x27;s at half the rate. One of the greatest advantages of the new 2400 bit/s MELPe is that it shares the same bit format as MELP, and hence can interoperate with legacy MELP systems, but would deliver better quality at both ends. MELPe provides much better quality than all older military standards, especially in noisy environments such as battlefield and vehicles and aircraft.

===STANAG-4591 (NATO)===
In 2002, following extensive competition and testing, the 2400 and 1200 bit/s US DoD MELPe was adopted also as NATO standard, known as STANAG-4591. The NATO testing performance measurements included voice intelligibility, voice quality, speaker recognition, language dependency, speaker dependency, 10 acoustic noise environments, transmission channel under 1% BER, tandem using 16 kbit/s CVSD vocoder, whispered speech, and real-time implementation. The testing data included Over 36,000 files, or 500 hours of speech under various conditions and languages. As part of NATO testing for new NATO standard, MELPe was tested against other candidates such as France&#x27;s HSX (Harmonic Stochastic eXcitation) and Turkey&#x27;s SB-LPC (Split-Band Linear Predictive Coding), as well as the old secure voice standards such as FS1015 LPC-10e (2.4 kbit/s), FS1016 CELP (4.8 kbit/s) and CVSD (16 kbit/s). Subsequently, the MELPe won also the NATO competition, surpassing the quality of all other candidates as well as the quality of all old secure voice standards (CVSD, CELP and LPC-10e). The NATO competition concluded that MELPe substantially improved performance (in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and noise immunity), while reducing throughput requirements. The NATO testing also included interoperability tests, used over 200 hours of speech data, and was conducted by 3 test laboratories worldwide. Compandent Inc, as a part of MELPe-based projects performed for NSA and NATO, provided NSA and NATO with special test-bed platform known as MELCODER device that provided the golden reference for real-time implementation of MELPe. The low-cost FLEXI-232 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) made by Compandent, which are based on the MELCODER golden reference, are very popular and widely used for evaluating and testing MELPe in real-time, various channels &amp; networks, and field conditions.

In 2005, a new 600 bit/s rate MELPe variation by Thales Group (France) was added (without extensive competition and testing as performed for the 2400/1200 bit/s MELPe) to the NATO standard STANAG-4591.

===300 bit/s MELP===
In 2010, MIT Lincoln Labs, Compandent, BBN, and General Dynamics also developed for DARPA a 300 bit/s MELP device . Its quality was better than the 600 bit/s MELPe, but its algorithmic delay was longer.

==Implementations==
The MELPe has been implemented in many applications including secure radio devices, satellite communications, VoIP, and cellphone applications. In such applications, additional expertise is required for combating channel errors, packet loss, and synchronization loss. Such expertise requires the understanding of the MELPe&#x27;s bits sensitivity to errors. The 2400 bit/s and 1200 bit/s MELPe include synchronization bit, which is useful in serial communications.

==Compression level==
MELPe is intended for the compression of speech. Given an audio input sampled at 8 kHz, the MELPe codec yields the following compression ratios over a 64 kbit/s μ-Law G.711 datastream, discounting the effects of protocol overhead:
Generally, speech coding involves a trade-off of different aspects including bit-rate, speech quality, delay (frame size and lookahead), computational complexity, robustness to different speakers and languages, robustness to different background noises, channel error robustness, and also codec state recovery in the face of packet loss. Since the MELPe&#x27;s lower rates (600 and 1200 bit/s) are supersets of the 2400 bit/s rate, the algorithm complexity (e.g. in MIPS) is about the same for all rates. The lower rates use increased frames and lookahead, as well as codebook size, therefore they require more memory.

==Intellectual property rights==
MELPe (and/or its derivatives) is subject to IPR licensing from the following companies, Texas Instruments (2400 bit/s MELP algorithm / source code), Microsoft (1200 bit/s transcoder), Thales Group (600 bit/s rate), Compandent, and AT&amp;T (Noise Pre-Processor NPP).

<text>Menlyn Park Shopping Centre is a large shopping mall in Menlyn, Pretoria, South Africa, owned by development company Pareto. It is designed around three spaces – the Food Court, the keyhole malls and focal points, and a large internal garden square surrounded by restaurants. Menlyn Park has a total lettable floor space of 177,000m², over 500 stores, 16 parking entrances, 12 parking exits and 8,250 parking bays. It is situated at the corner of Lois Avenue and Atterbury Road, close to the passing N1 highway (Pretoria Eastern Bypass).

==History==
Menlyn Park Shopping Centre, named after the suburb in which it is located, was originally built in 1979. It was transformed and expanded in 1988 by Bild Architects. Menlyn Park used to be the property of Old Mutual Properties from London, England, but is currently owned by Pareto Limited, a shopping centre investment firm wholly owned by the Public Investment Corporation. Since its inception, Menlyn Park has undergone a number of renovations.

===First redesign===
In 1998, an American design firm, Development Design Group, designed Menlyn&#x27;s unique appearance. Menlyn Park had over 300 stores and 37 restaurants as well as a rooftop Drive In Theatre and a Nu Metro cineplex.

===Expansion===
In 2000, the mall underwent another expansion, increasing the floor space to 118,253m² and the store number to 300.

===Modernisation and refurbishment===
November 2016 saw the completion of another major expansion, which increased the floor area to approximately 177,000m² with 500 shops in total. The R2,5-billion, two-year phased refurbishment has converted the site to become the regional shopping centre in Tshwane. BILD Architects and Terra Ether Architects designed the new structure while Concor Construction executed the works.
The new building attained a 4-star Green Star Retail Design rating by the Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) for the efforts to develop the first building phase of the redevelopment along environmentally friendly design and construction principles

<doc id="1080632" wikidata="Q2522140" url="?curid=1080632" title="Evening Star (Fripp &amp; Eno album)">
<text>Evening Star is the second studio album by British musicians Robert Fripp and Brian Eno. It was recorded from 1974 to 1975 and released in December 1975 by Island Records.

== Background and recording ==
&quot;Evening Star&quot; and the preceding seven-show European tour by Fripp and Eno marked Fripp&#x27;s first musical output after King Crimson disbanded for the first time, and his last before temporarily retiring from music to study at John G. Bennett&#x27;s International Academy for Continuous Education.

== Content ==
AllMusic described &quot;Evening Star&quot; as &quot;a less harsh, more varied affair [than &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot;], closer to Eno&#x27;s then-developing idea of ambient music than what had come before&quot;. The first three tracks consist of Frippertronics accented with effects, synthesizer and piano by Eno. Track four, &quot;Wind on Wind&quot;, is a remix of a short excerpt from Eno&#x27;s &quot;Discreet Music&quot;, released a week after &quot;Evening Star&quot;. Eno had originally intended for Fripp to use the material which became &quot;Discreet Music&quot; as a backing tape to play over in improvised live performances.

The second side of the album consists entirely of a twenty-eight-minute piece of Frippertronics-based drone music titled &quot;An Index of Metals&quot;, in which distortion increases as the track progresses.

The album&#x27;s cover is a painting by Peter Schmidt.

== Release ==
&quot;Evening Star&quot; was released in December 1975 by Island Records. It was Fripp&#x27;s only album to be released during his brief retirement.

== Legacy ==
Tracks from &quot;Evening Star&quot; were used in the radio series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Primary Phase&quot;. &quot;Wind on Water&quot; and &quot;Wind on Wind&quot; were included on the soundtrack to the 1983 film &quot;Breathless&quot;.

<doc id="1080633" wikidata="Q533456" url="?curid=1080633" title="Cricklade">
<text>Cricklade is a town and civil parish on the River Thames in north Wiltshire, England, midway between Swindon and Cirencester. It is the first downstream town on the Thames. The parish population at the 2011 census was 4,227.
==History==
Cricklade was founded in the 9th century by the Anglo-Saxons, at the point where the Ermin Way Roman road crossed the River Thames. It was the home of a royal mint from 979 to 1100; there are some Cricklade coins in the town museum. The Domesday Book of 1086 records a settlement at &quot;Crichelade&quot;, with a church, and at the centre of a hundred of the same name.

=== Anglo-Saxon fortification ===
Cricklade is one of 30 burhs (boroughs, i.e. fortresses or fortified towns) recorded in the Burghal Hidage document, which describes a system of fortresses and fortified towns built around Wessex by King Alfred. Recent research suggests these burhs were built in the short period 878–879 to defend Wessex against the Vikings under Guthrum, and to act as an offensive to the Viking presence in Mercia. Cricklade was an important part of these defences, being a short distance down Ermin Way from Cirencester, where the Vikings made their base for a year. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, completion of this system precipitated the retreat of the Vikings from Mercia and London to East Anglia in late 879.

The square defences of the fortification have been excavated in several places on all four sides since the 1940s, possibly making them the most extensively sampled fortification of the period. In the initial phase, a walkway of laid stones marked the rear of a bank of stacked turfs and clay which had been dug from three external ditches. In the second phase, the front of the bank, which after only a short time probably became degraded, was replaced by a stone wall. This wall enclosed the defences on all four sides, considerably strengthening the defensive capabilities of the burh. It has recently been suggested the stone wall was inserted in the 890s. Other burhs of the Burghal Hidage were also strengthened with stone walls, which suggests this was part of a systematic upgrade of the defensive provisions for Wessex, ordered by the king.

The third phase is marked by systematic razing of the stone wall, which was pulled down over the inner berm (the space between the wall and the inner ditch). The stones were used to fill the inner two ditches, which shows the process was deliberate. A similar phase can be seen in the archaeological record at Christchurch, Dorset, another burh of the Hidage. Observations at other burhs suggest this phase of destruction was implemented over the whole of Wessex as a concerted policy, again, by inference, on the part of the king. The destruction may be linked to the accession of King Cnut in the early 11th century, to prevent the burhs being seized and used against him by his rivals.

The fourth phase is marked by reuse of the original Anglo-Saxon defences by inserting a timber palisade along the line of the original wall. This probably marks a renewal of the defences of the town during the civil war of 1144 under King Stephen.

There is little archaeological evidence of the community protected by these defences in the Saxon period, although there are signs that streets were laid out in a regular fashion behind the main north–south High Street. A gate in the northern line of the defences led to a causeway over the flood plain of the Thames and a bridge over the river, which was probably of a defensive nature.

=== Other settlements ===
Widhill, south-east of Cricklade beyond the River Ray, had two small estates at the time of Domesday Book and was later a tithing of St Sampson&#x27;s parish, Cricklade. In 1934 the boundary of Cricklade parish was redrawn along the river, transferring the Widhill area into Blunsdon St Andrew parish (since 2017, St Andrews parish).

Outlying hamlets in Cricklade parish are Calcutt, Chelworth Lower Green, Chelworth Upper Green, Hailstone Hill and Horsey Down.

=== Later history ===
On John Speed&#x27;s 1611 map of Wiltshire, the town&#x27;s name is recorded as &quot;Crekelade&quot;. Cricklade Museum houses several publications recounting further historical details of the town and its people.

The Jubilee Clock, on a cast-iron pillar, stands at a road junction on the High Street. It was erected in 1897 to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

==Governance==
The civil parish elects a town council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs most of the major local-government functions.

There is an electoral ward with the name of Cricklade and Latton, which combines Cricklade parish with its neighbours to the north and north-east – Latton and Marston Maisey – and elects one member of Wiltshire Council. The ward population recorded in the 2011 census was 4,982.

The parish is in the South Cotswolds parliamentary constituency. From 1295 the Cricklade constituency returned two members of parliament. This parliamentary borough represented just the town until 1782, when its boundaries were extended into the surrounding countryside. It later came to include Swindon, then a village. In 1885, Cricklade became a county constituency electing a single member. Cricklade constituency was abolished in 1918, with the town joining the Chippenham constituency, which was renamed to North Wiltshire in 1983; a new South Cotswolds constituency came into effect at the 2024 general election, when the seat was won by Roz Savage for the Liberal Democrats.

==Sport and pastimes==

=== Rugby Union ===
The club was founded in 1992 by ex-school players from many schools, meeting at the bar of the Vale Hotel, Cricklade, then owned by ex-President and life members the Ross family. Initially players were committed to other clubs, so Sunday fixtures were played, the first one against Aldbourne on 6 September. In its second season the fixtures moved to Saturdays. The club joined the Dorset and Wilts leagues in 1994, but withdrew as the travelling involved was too burdensome. They were able to rejoin in 2001 when the leagues were re-structured into North and South.

The club originally used pitches from Prior Park School and the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. Since 2001 it has played on a prepared pitch in the town leased by the town council. The first game to be held there was between Cricklade and the President&#x27;s Select XV squad from all rival clubs – about a dozen clubs formed the squad, who played in Gloucester jerseys donated for the day by Gloucester RFC.

Over the years Cricklade Rugby Club has toured over England, West and South Wales and Ireland, with teams spanning a broad range of levels of skill and age category.

=== Shows and festivals ===
The Cricklade Show is held each summer, typically featuring music, dancing and a cricket match.

The town holds an annual festival, usually taking place on Father&#x27;s Day in June.

=== Charity sports ===
Run annually in the first Sunday of October, the Cricklade Fun Run hosts a half marathon, 10 km and Fun Run event for around 750 runners. This raises funds for a number of local charities.

The Cricklade Triathlon runs in the summer for both adults and juniors.

=== Leisure centre ===
Towards the end of 2006, North Wiltshire District Council proposed closing the leisure centre. After a campaign, the local residents took over the running of the centre and were successful in turning its fortunes. It has a swimming pool, sports hall with a range of markings, a bar and lounge area with balcony and barbecue, a skate park, and children&#x27;s play areas. In 2009, money was raised for a climbing wall.

=== Cricket ===
Cricklade Cricket Club was established in 1877 and has been located since 1947 on the north side of Cricklade, where its ground (Southam) is next to the River Thames. For the 2016 season the club is running two senior Saturday teams, a friendly Sunday team, a midweek team and three youth teams (U15, U13 and U11s), all in the local Cotswold District Cricket Association leagues.

=== Association football ===
Cricklade Town F.C. is a non-League football team which plays at the Cricklade Leisure Centre.

Cricklade Youth Football Club provides and promotes the playing of association football for the youth of Cricklade from U7s to U16s. The club was the first in Wiltshire to gain the Wiltshire FA Charter Standard, an award for clubs across the country that meet the high standards required by the Football Association.

=== Cricklade cinema ===
Since Autumn 2013, Cricklade Town Hall has shown films every 4th Tuesday of the month from September to April. They include recent releases, classics, and non-mainstream films.

== Nature ==

=== North Meadow ===
North Meadow is a large nature reserve which preserves some 80 per cent of Britain&#x27;s wild snake&#x27;s head fritillaries in its . The meadow lies between the Thames and the Churn, which create a unique habitat for the fritillary by winter flooding. Such meadows were once common in Britain, but many were drained and ploughed for arable crops from the 1730s onwards. North Meadow escaped this owing to preservation of its court leet, the Saxon system of town governance that ensured the land was held in common. The site is now managed by Natural England, with support from the court leet.

=== Blakehill ===
In 2000, a disused airfield, formerly RAF Blakehill Farm, was bought from the Ministry of Defence by Wiltshire Wildlife Trust to form a second larger meadow of around , which opened to the public in 2005. It rears a small quantity of organic grade beef, usually from rare breeds such as English Longhorns.

=== Cotswold Water Park ===
Cricklade lies between the east and west sections of Cotswold Water Park, an extensive nature reserve formed from disused gravel pits.

== Schools ==

=== St Sampson&#x27;s C of E Primary School ===
The state primary St Sampson&#x27;s Church of England School was linked with the major local landmark, the Anglican St Sampson&#x27;s parish church. It was divided in 1979 into two schools on the same Bath Road site: St Sampson&#x27;s Infants&#x27; School, for ages 4–7, and St Sampson&#x27;s C of E Junior School, for ages 7–11. In 2014, the schools merged again to form St Sampson&#x27;s C of E (VC) Primary School.

=== Cricklade Manor Preparatory School ===
This private school is non-selective and has around 200 pupils aged 3–13. It is housed in the late 19th-century Manor House, which until 2017 housed a prep school linked to Prior Park College, Bath.

=== Former schools ===
Meadowpark School was an independent school established in 1996 for children aged 4–11, which closed in 2021. It was housed in the former St Mary&#x27;s School, built in 1860 just south of the Town Bridge.

== Churches ==
=== Anglican ===

St Sampson&#x27;s is the town&#x27;s Church of England parish church. Dating from the 12th century, it is dedicated to the 5th-century Welsh saint, Samson of Dol. The present building rests on the remains of another, Saxon, church of AD 890. The main part was built in 1240–1280, although on close inspection the earlier work can still be seen. The large tower with four corner pinnacles, the dominant landmark of the town, was built in 1551–1553 by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, father-in-law to Lady Jane Grey. The church is a Grade I listed building.

=== Roman Catholic ===

Since 1984, St Mary&#x27;s Church has been leased by the Catholic congregation, after it was declared redundant by the Church of England in 1981. The building is Grade II* listed.

Standing just inside the Saxon town wall, it dates from the 12th century and has a low tower completed about 1400. St Mary&#x27;s had its own small parish, the northern part of the town and its environs, until 1952, when it was united with St Sampson&#x27;s.

The churchyard, south of the church, contains a complete 14th-century limestone cross, a Grade I listed structure.

=== United Church ===
Cricklade United Church, Calcutt Street, was built by Congregationalists in 1878, in front of a small meeting house of 1799 which is now the church hall. The congregation joined the United Reformed Church on its formation in 1972 and later merged with Methodists as Cricklade United Reformed and Methodist Church.

=== Former Methodist chapels ===
Primitive Methodists built a hall in Calcutt Street, near the High Street, in 1855, and the Wesleyans built theirs just north of the Town Bridge, near the Priory, in 1870.

In 1938 the two churches united and used the Calcutt Street hall. The Priory building was at first a Sunday school, then after the Second World War was taken over by Wiltshire County Council Education Department, and is now a community hall called Thames Hall. The Calcutt Street building became a doctors&#x27; surgery after the move to the United Church.

==Motto, blooms and twinning==
Cricklade&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;In Loco Delicioso&quot; means &quot;in a pleasant place&quot;. In 2008 the town was awarded Best Small Town in UK in the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Britain in Bloom Finals and in 2011 the Champion of Champions award in the Britain in Bloom competition.

Cricklade has been twinned with the French town of Sucé-sur-Erdre since 1990. In June 2010 the 20th anniversary was celebrated in Cricklade. Sucé lies just north of Nantes in the Loire Valley, from the Atlantic coast. Visits are exchanged in alternate years. Cricklade Twinning Association also holds social events to raise funds towards hosting the visits by Sucé to Cricklade.

== Saxons Rest controversy ==
In 2009 Cricklade Town Council (with help from Cricklade Bloomers) built a town garden on an open space near Waylands called Saxons Rest, which included two large flagpoles. This caused controversy among residents of the High Street, who considered their view across the open space would be spoilt and there would be noise from the halyards on the poles. The build went ahead despite a significant number signing a petition against it. The majority of opinion was against the flagpoles, considering them a needless and pretentious feature. Once built, the consensus became that it was an attractive feature and enhanced the area. The overriding feeling had been that the town&#x27;s funds would be better directed elsewhere, for instance to prevention of crime and vandalism in the town, which was rising. The open space behind the garden is a scheduled monument, as this is the location of the Saxon town walls, although they are no longer visible.

==Business and economy==

Cricklade Business Association represents the local business community and has close links with other non-profit organisations, such as the Rotarians, the Waylands Trust, and the charity that runs the leisure centre.

An above-average proportion of the ward population ward was retired at the time of the 2011 census.

There is a local museum in Calcutt Street run by the Cricklade Historical Society, housed in a former Baptist chapel. T. R. Thomson of Costorphine was a long-time resident of Cricklade and a moving spirit behind the establishment of the society. His book &quot;Materials for a History of Cricklade&quot; and various articles have enhanced the study of local history in the town.
==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and BBC West on BBC One, and by ITV Meridian and ITV West Country on ITV1. Television signals can be received from either the Oxford or Mendip TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire on 103.5 FM, Heart West on 97.2 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly Sam FM) on 107.7 and Swindon 105.5, a community based radio station, broadcasts from its studios in Swindon on 105.5 FM.

The Swindon Advertiser and Gazette and Herald are the local newspapers that serve the town.

==Transport==
The Thames Path runs through Cricklade then continues downstream on the south bank to Eysey Footbridge, where it crosses to the other bank.

The North Wilts Canal, opened in 1819, passed to the west of the town, linking the Thames and Severn Canal with the Wilts and Berks Canal. Abandoned in the early 20th century, parts are now being restored. The Town Bridge, built in 1812, marks the limits of navigation rights on the River Thames.

Cricklade railway station on the Midland and South Western Junction Railway linked Swindon with Cirencester, but was closed in 1961 and no trace of the station remains. Part of the railway route forms a cycle path (National Cycle Route 45). South of the town, the Swindon and Cricklade Railway is restoring the line as a leisure facility. Since 2007 passenger trains have been run between Blunsdon and Hayes Knoll, and in 2014 the line was extended to Taw Valley Halt on the edge of Swindon. It is also being extended towards Cricklade. The nearest station to Cricklade at present is Hayes Knoll. The nearest mainline railway station is on the Great Western Main Line.

The A419 Swindon to Cirencester road bypasses the town to the north-east.

Stagecoach West operates the hourly bus route 51 into Cricklade between Swindon and Cirencester.

<doc id="1080636" wikidata="Q2424966" url="?curid=1080636" title="Thomas J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan politician)">
<text>Thomas James Fitzpatrick (14 February 1918 – 2 October 2006) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1982 to 1987, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry from 1981 to 1982, Minister for Transport and Power from 1976 to 1977 and Minister for Lands from 1973 to 1976. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 1989. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1961 to 1965.

==Early life==
Fitzpatrick was born and raised in the village of Scotshouse, near Clones, in the west of County Monaghan, being born in February 1918. He was educated at St. Macartan&#x27;s College, the Incorporated Law Society and University College, Dublin (UCD), where he qualified as a solicitor; he then entered practice as a solicitor in Cavan town.

==Politics==
Fitzpatrick first held political office in 1950, when he was elected to Cavan Urban District Council. In 1961, he moved to national politics when he was elected to Seanad Éireann. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cavan constituency at the 1965 general election. He held many Opposition Front Bench portfolios including Defence, Health and Social Welfare, Justice and the Environment, as well as being Fine Gael Chief Whip from 1979 to 1981.

Fitzpatrick served in the Irish Government on several occasions under Liam Cosgrave and Garret FitzGerald. His first government post was in 1973, when he was appointed Minister for Lands. After Fine Gael lost power in 1977, he was mentioned as a possible leader of the party if a compromise were needed between FitzGerald and Cosgrave. Following the November 1982 general election, he was elected as Ceann Comhairle, a post which he held until 1987. Fitzpatrick was re-elected to the Dáil (or automatically returned as Ceann Comhairle) at every election until 1989 when he retired from politics.

<text>Toghon Temür (; Mongolian script: ; ; 25 May 1320 – 23 May 1370), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Huizong of Yuan (; ), bestowed by the Northern Yuan dynasty, and by his posthumous name as the Emperor Shun of Yuan (; ) bestowed by the Ming dynasty, was the last emperor of the Yuan dynasty and later the first emperor of the Northern Yuan dynasty. Apart from Emperor of China, he is also considered the last Khagan of the Mongol Empire. He was a son of Kusala, known as Emperor Mingzong (; ).

During the last years of his reign, the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Red Turban Rebellion, which established the Ming dynasty, although the Yuan court under his rule remained in control of northern China and the Mongolian Plateau. The remnant Yuan regime is known as the Northern Yuan in historiography.

Emperor Huizong was a Buddhist student of the Karmapas (heads of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism) and is considered a previous incarnation of the Tai Situpas. He also notably invited the Jonang savant Dölpopa Shérab Gyeltsen to teach him, but was rebuffed.

==Before succession==
Toghon Temür was born to Kuśala, known as Khutughtu Khan or Emperor Mingzong, when he was in exile in Central Asia. Toghon Temür&#x27;s mother was Mailaiti, descendant of Arslan Khan, the chief of the Karluks, a prominent nomadic Turkic tribal confederacy in Central Asia. According to a folk legend, the former Chinese Southern Song Emperor Gong of Song, Zhao Xian, having surrendered to Yuan as a toddler, had an affair with Yuan Empress Mailaiti near the end of his life. Zhao Xian allegedly fathered Yuan Toghon Temür with Mailaiti. The Mongols circulated a similar story about Toghon Temür fathering Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty.

Following the civil war known as the War of the Two Capitals that broke out after the death of Yesün Temür (Emperor Taiding) in 1328, Toghon Temür attended to his father and entered Shangdu from Mongolia. However, after Kuśala died and his younger brother was restored to the throne as Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür (Emperor Wenzong), he was kept from the court and was banished to Goryeo (modern Korea) and later to Guangxi in South China. While he was in exile, his stepmother Babusha was executed.

When Emperor Wenzong died in 1332, his widow, Empress Dowager Budashiri respected his will to make the son of Kuśala succeed to the throne instead of Wenzong&#x27;s own son, El Tegüs. However, it was not Toghon Temür but his younger half-brother Rinchinbal, who was enthroned as Rinchinbal Khan (Emperor Ningzong). However, he died only two months into his reign. The de facto ruler, El Temür, attempted to install El Tegüs as emperor but was stopped by Empress Budashiri. As a result, Toghon Temür was summoned back from Guangxi. El Temür feared that Toghon Temür, who was too mature to be a puppet, would take up arms against him since he was suspected of the assassination of Toghon Temür&#x27;s father, Emperor Mingzong. The enthronement was postponed for six months until El Temür died in 1333.

In 1333, Toghon Temür first met Lady Gi, a Korean concubine, with whom he fell deeply in love. Lady Gi had been sent to China sometime in the late 1320s as &quot;human tribute&quot; as the kings of Goryeo were required to send a certain number of beautiful teenage girls to Yuan to serve as concubines after the Mongol invasions.

==Reign==

===Early reign===
The new emperor appointed his cousin El Tegüs crown prince as he was ward of El Tegüs&#x27; mother Empress Dowager Budashiri, but he was controlled by warlords even after El Temür&#x27;s death. Among them, Bayan became as powerful as El Temür had been. He served as minister of the Secretariat and crushed a rebellion by El Temür&#x27;s son Tang Ki-se. During his despotic rule, he made several purges and also suspended the imperial examination system. When Toghon Temür tried to promote Lady Ki to secondary wife, which was contrary to the standard practice of only taking secondary wives from Mongol clans, it created such opposition at court to this unheard of promotion for a Korean woman that he was forced to back down. In 1339, when Lady Ki gave birth to a son, whom Toghon Temür decided would be his successor, he was finally able to have Lady Ki named his secondary wife in 1340.

As Toghon Temür matured, he came to disfavor Bayan&#x27;s autocratic rule. In 1340 he allied with Bayan&#x27;s nephew Toqto&#x27;a, who was in discord with Bayan, and banished Bayan in a coup. He also removed El Tegüs and Empress Budashiri from court. With the help of Toqto&#x27;a, he also managed to purge officials that had dominated the administration.

===Middle reign===
With the dismissal of Bayan, Toqto&#x27;a seized the power of the court. His first administration clearly exhibited fresh new spirit. The young leader was quick to distinguish his regime as something wholly different from Bayan&#x27;s. A new Chinese era name, Zhizheng (), was decreed to show this. Bayan&#x27;s purges were called off. Many of the great Chinese literati came back to the capital from voluntary retirement or from administrative exile and the imperial examination system was restored.

Toqto&#x27;a also gave a few early signs of a new and positive direction in central government. One of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the Liao, Jin and Song dynasties, which were eventually completed in 1345.

Toqto&#x27;a resigned his office with the approval of Toghon Temür in June 1344, which marked the end of his first administration. The several short-lived administrations that followed from 1344 and 1349 would develop an agenda very different from Toqto&#x27;a&#x27;s. In 1347, the emperor forced Toqto&#x27;a into Gansu with assistance from former officers of Kuśala and Yesün Temür.

In 1349, Toghon Temür recalled Toqto&#x27;a, which began Toqto&#x27;a&#x27;s second and very different administration.

===Late reign===

Since the late 1340s, people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters, droughts, floods, and ensuing famines. The lack of effective government policy led to a loss of support from the people. Illicit salt dealers who were disaffected by the government&#x27;s salt monopoly raised a rebellion in 1348, triggering many revolts around the empire. Among them was the Red Turban Rebellion, which started in 1351 and grew into a nationwide turmoil.

In 1354, when Toqto&#x27;a led a large army to crush the Red Turban rebels, Toghon Temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal. This resulted in the restoration of Toghon Temür&#x27;s power but also a rapid weakening of the central government. Thus he had no choice but to rely on the forces of local warlords.

Toghon Temür gradually lost interest in politics and ceased to intervene in political struggles. His son Biligtü Khan, who became Crown Prince in 1353, attempted to seize power and came into conflict with Toghon Temür&#x27;s aides, who dominated politics instead of the khan. During this time power was increasingly exercised by Lady Ki. Chief Empress Lady Ki and his minister persuaded Biligtü Khan to overthrow the latter. Toghon Temür was unable to conciliate the dispute but executed the minister. In 1364 the Shanxi-based warlord Bolad Temür occupied Khanbaliq and expelled the Crown Prince from the winter base. In alliance with the Henan-based warlord Köke Temür, Biligtü Khan defeated Bolad Temür in the next year. This internal struggle resulted in further weakening of the political and military power of the central government. In 1365, Toghon Temür finally promoted his much beloved Lady Ki to First Empress and announced that his son by her would be the first in the line of succession.

During the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius&#x27; descendants, who was one of the Duke Yansheng Kong Huan&#x27;s sons, named Kong Shao 孔紹, moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there called the Gong clan of Qufu after marrying a Korean woman (Jo Jin-gyeong&#x27;s 曹晉慶 daughter) during Toghon Temür&#x27;s rule. (Also see and )

==Relations with other nations==

===Avignon Papacy===
Pope John XXII and Pope Benedict XII successfully extended a network of Catholic churches throughout the Mongol Empire from Crimea to China between 1317 and 1343. The archbishop of Khanbaliq, John of Montecorvino, died in 1328. With the backing of the Toghon Temür, the Alans wrote to Pope Benedict XII in 1336 asking for a new metropolitan. In 1338, the pope sent back the embassy headed by Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli, who stayed at Beijing three or four years. They brought gifts for Toghon Temür that included fine European horses.

===Japan===
When the Koreans captured a Japanese fishing ship they thought was spying, the Goryeo court sent it to their overlord, the Yuan emperor Toghon Temür, who then sent the fishermen back to Japan. In reply, the Ashikaga shogunate sent an embassy led by a monk to express its gratitude.

==Retreat to the north==
After absorbing the Chen Han dynasty, conquering Southern China, and establishing the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang – crowned as the Hongwu Emperor – conducted military expeditions to North China and defeated the Yuan army in 1368. When Köke Temür lost battles against the Ming general Xu Da and Ming troops approached Hebei, Toghon Temür gave up Khanbaliq and fled to his summer base, Shangdu.

In 1369 when Shangdu also fell under the Ming&#x27;s occupation, Toghon Temür fled northward to Yingchang, which was located in present-day Inner Mongolia. He died there in 1370; his son succeeded him as Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara and retreated to Karakorum in the same year. The Yuan remnants ruled northern China and the Mongolian Plateau while they continued to claim the title of Emperor of China, from which point they are referred to as the Northern Yuan dynasty. He was the longest-lived emperor of Yuan China after Kublai Khan.

At the time of his death, the Northern Yuan maintained its influence, stretching the domination from the Sea of Japan to the Altai Mountains. There were also pro-Yuan, anti-Ming forces in Yunnan and Guizhou. Even though its control over China proper had not been stable yet, the Ming considered that the Yuan lost the Mandate of Heaven when it abandoned Khanbaliq, and that the Yuan was overthrown in 1368. The Ming did not treat Toghon Temür after 1368 and his successor Ayushiridara as legitimate emperors.

The Ming gave Toghon Temür the posthumous name &quot;Emperor Shun&quot; (順皇帝), which implied that he followed the Mandate of Heaven ceding his empire to the Ming. But the Northern Yuan dynasty gave him their own posthumous name &quot;Emperor Xuanren Puxiao&quot; (宣仁普孝皇帝) and temple name &quot;Huizong&quot; (惠宗).

Even after Toghon Temür, there was still Yuan resistance to the Ming in the south. In southwestern China, Basalawarmi, the self-styled &quot;Prince of Liang&quot;, established a Yuan resistance movement in Yunnan and Guizhou that was not put down until 1381.

==Legacy==
Mongolian chronicles such as the &quot;Erdeniin Tobchi&quot; include a poem known as the &quot;Lament of Toghon Temür&quot;. It deals with his grieving after the loss of Khanbaliq (Beijing).

<text>Bognor or Bust is a 2004 UK television panel game, on the subject of news and current affairs. Produced by 4DTV for ITV, the show conventionally gave contestants the opportunity to win prizes, yet was comedic in style. It combined members of the public and celebrities on the same panel.

The show was hosted by comic actor and presenter Angus Deayton. His hosting of this show was largely viewed as his next step after being ousted from &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Designing the style of the show to be similar to that of &quot;HIGNFY&quot; may have been deliberate.

Before the game began, the two contestants picked two out of a group of four celebrities to play on their team. In Round 1, Deayton asked a series of questions on the week&#x27;s news, to be answered on the buzzer]. At the end of the round, there was a quick recap of the scores. For the End of Part 1, the viewers were shown a picture with something missing, and were asked to guess what it is during the commercial break. In Part 2, the missing object was revealed (to general amusement) and Round 2 commenced. The player in the lead chose one of two pictures that served as (not very good) cryptic clues to a certain category. The team then had to answer a succession of quick-fire questions within that category in a time limit. Afterwards, the process repeated with the other team and the other category. At the end of Round 2, the player with the most points proceeded to the final round.

The final round consisted of a single multiple choice question with two possible answers, on which the contestant can confer with all four celebrities. When answered correctly, the contestant was awarded a paid-for exotic holiday. (The question was based on a story taken from a newspaper from the country from the holiday&#x27;s destination.) However, if the final question was answered incorrectly, the contestant was instead &#x27;awarded&#x27; a trip to the seaside resort Bognor Regis in West Sussex, from which the name of the show was derived, and a randomly selected member of the audience won the exotic holiday. In the context of this show, Bognor was not seen as an upmarket resort and was therefore a satirical booby prize.

Despite steady ratings of three to four million viewers, the series was not recommissioned following its original run.

<doc id="1080667" wikidata="Q1509799" url="?curid=1080667" title="Gerald Bartley">
<text>Gerald Bartley (12 June 1898 – 18 April 1975) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for the Gaeltacht and Minister for Defence from 1959 to 1965. He was a TD for the Galway and Galway West constituencies from 1932 until his retirement in 1965.

Bartley was born in Cloghan, County Mayo. He was the son of RIC Sergeant John Bartley and Anne Costelloe, a grocer. His family later settled in Clifden, County Galway. He was educated at O&#x27;Connell Schools in Dublin and joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914. He served with the West Connemara Brigade flying column from early 1921 during the War of Independence, was promoted to vice-brigadier of the West Connemara Brigade of the Irish Republican Army in the Truce period, took the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War, was involved in a number of attacks on National Army troops and was captured by the Free State Government in October 1922 and interned until June 1924. In 1925 Bartley was elected to Galway County Council and served as chairman of the finance committee before his election to Dáil Éireann. Bartley applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934 and was awarded 7 and 5/6 years service in 1937 at Grade C for service with the Irish Volunteers and the IRA between 1 April 1917 and 30 September 1923.

For almost twenty years Bartley remained as a backbench TD before his first government appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in 1951. On returning to government in 1957, Bartley was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He was moved to the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance the following year before joining the cabinet as Minister for the Gaeltacht in 1959. Two years later Bartley became Minister for Defence, a post he held until his retirement from politics in 1965.

<text>Yippy was a metasearch engine that grouped searched results into clusters. It was originally developed and released by Vivísimo in 2004 under the name Clusty, before Vivisimo was later acquired by IBM and Yippy was sold in 2010 to a company now called Yippy, Inc. At the time, the website received 100,000 unique visitors a month.

From August 2019, Yippy&#x27;s main page stated their searches were powered by IBM Watson, asserting it was &quot;the &quot;right&quot; search&quot; (italics theirs) that delivered &quot;fair search results based on balanced algorithms.&quot;

In 2019, Yippy CEO Rich Granville presented the search engine as free of censorship of conservative views, calling it an &quot;intelligence enterprise&quot; with high-level White House connections, telling a reporter &quot;you don&#x27;t know who you’re fucking with.&quot;

From late April 2021 to early June 2022, the website would redirect to DuckDuckGo.

==History==
Clusty was developed by Vivísimo in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Vivísimo was a company built on Web search technology developed by Carnegie Mellon University researchers, much like Lycos was a decade earlier. Clusty added new features and a new interface to the previous Vivisimo clustering web metasearch. Different tabs also offer metasearch for news, jobs (in partnership with Indeed.com), U.S. government information, and blogs. Customized tabs allow users to select sources for their own metasearch to create personalized tabs.

Yippy Inc., formerly Cinnabar Ventureess Inc., acquired Clusty for $5.55 million in May 2010. The acquisition included the license for the Velocity software, which was bought by IBM in 2012 and renamed IBM Watson Explorer.

In 2012, Yippy received &quot;Welcome to the Cloud&quot; as a registered trademark with the USPTO.

Yippy acquired MuseGlobal 6,500 pre-built Smart Connectors fully documented Source Factory that monitors, maintains and updates the Muse Smart Connectors on a 24/7 basis and guarantees highly sustainable and scalable use.

Yippy received &quot;Welcome to your Data&quot; as a registered trademark with the USPTO.

In 2016, Yippy released its Yippy Search Appliance (YSA) as a Google Search Appliance (GSA) replacement to market after Google announced it was sunsetting the GSA and capitalizing on the $500M revenue from the GSA.

In 2019, Yippy Inc. CEO Rich Granville organized in Atlanta a &quot;Digital Soldiers Conference&quot;, with the aim of preparing &quot;patriotic social media warriors&quot; for a coming &quot;digital civil war&quot; against &quot;censorship and suppression&quot;. The event featured several prominent Donald Trump supporters, including Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos. At the time, Granville also used many QAnon references on Twitter.

In late April 2021, Yippy&#x27;s site started redirecting to DuckDuckGo. As of August 2021, the Georgia Secretary of State website shows Yippy, Inc&#x27;s corporate status as &quot;Revoked&quot;.

<doc id="1080679" wikidata="Q4697475" url="?curid=1080679" title="Ainsdale">
<text>Ainsdale is a village near Southport, in the Sefton district, in Merseyside, England, situated three miles south of the centre of Southport. Originally in the historic county of Lancashire, at the 2001 Census it had a population of 12,723. By the time of the 2011 census, only figures for Ainsdale (ward) were available.

It makes up the southern edge of the town, separated from neighbouring Formby by RAF Woodvale. The village and roads leading to the beach are middle class areas, with some new modern developments around the station, including the addition of the private estate Village Row in 2006, and the Belway estate in 2013.

==History==
===Prior to 1600===
Ainsdale was listed in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Einulvesdel&quot;. Deriving from Old Norse name &quot;Einulfsdalr&quot;, this apparently was the valley occupied by a Scandinavian by the name of Einulf.

===1600–present===
Ainsdale formed part of Sir Cuthbert Halsall of Halsall&#x27;s estates during the early part of the 1600s. After financial difficulties the land containing Ainsdale (then &quot;Aynsdale&quot;) had to be sold. In 1634 the ownership was passed to Robert Blundell. The lands were passed from generation to generation within the Blundell family and remained in their ownership until the mid-1900s.

Throughout the 1800s Ainsdale remained an agricultural community. Prior to the British Agricultural Revolution fields and farms in the locality were small and land was enclosed. The 1841 Census listed 176 inhabitants in 33 houses with occupations of farmer, agricultural labourers and servants.

Ainsdale railway station opened in 1848. A second station, on a different railway line, was opened in 1901. It was originally named Seaside, being renamed Ainsdale Beach in 1912. It closed in 1952. The route of the line it was on now forms the Coastal Road from Woodvale to Southport. The row of houses over the road from the Sands Hotel were originally railway staff cottages for that line.

In 1894 Ainsdale became a civil parish, being formed from part of Formby and became part of West Lancashire Rural District, in 1905 it became part of Birkdale Urban District, in 1912 it became part of the County Borough of Southport, on 1 April 1925 the parish was abolished and merged with Southport. In 1921 the parish had a population of 2942.

====Land speed record====
On 16 March 1926, Sir Henry Segrave set his first land speed record of using &quot;Ladybird&quot;, a 4-litre Sunbeam Tiger on Ainsdale beach. This record was broken a month later by J.G. Parry-Thomas driving Babs, a custom-built car with a 27-litre V12 Liberty aero engine.

==Governance==
The area of Ainsdale, together with the adjoining settlement of Woodvale, and a significant part of Birkdale, forms a single electoral ward named Ainsdale, it is currently represented by three councillors on Sefton Council. As of May 2023, they were Janet Harrison (Labour), Lynne Thompson (Liberal Democrat) and Tony Brough (Conservative).

For parliamentary elections, the ward is part of the Southport constituency, currently represented by the Conservative MP, Damien Moore, who was elected at the 2019 United Kingdom general election. As part of constituency boundary changes effective at the next general election, the town will move into the Sefton Central constituency.

==Landmarks==

Ainsdale Mill, built circa 1800 on the site of an earlier wooden mill, was an impressive - and functional - landmark until its closure in 1965 and later demolition. A branch railway line from Ainsdale railway station served the corn mill during its operating years. The original Ainsdale timber post windmill served both Ainsdale and Birkdale and is mentioned in 1631 as being ‘in the possession of Cuthbert Rimmer’, in a lease from Robert Blundell.

Ainsdale boating lake, along with the beach itself, were popular tourist attractions, and thus Lakeside Hotel (now known as &quot;The Sands&quot;) was built to accommodate those wishing to stay in the area. However, a large campsite was also well populated in the busiest periods of the year.

In the village green there is a war memorial that commemorates the lives of forty-four Ainsdale residents killed as a result of the First World War.The War Memorial was totally refurbished by the Ainsdale Civic Society in 2012 when some missing names of those Ainsdale men killed in action in WW1 and extra plaques were inset on the Memorial to accommodate those lost from WW2 and Afghanistan. It took two years of research and fundraising to complete the second part of the project to restore the monument to its former glory. Space has been left on the memorial for additional names; however, they hope it never needs to be filled.

==Transport==
The locality is served by Ainsdale railway station, which is situated on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network, linking Southport to Liverpool. Trains operate every 15 minutes in each direction from early morning to late evening from Monday to Saturday and every 30 minutes on Sundays.

Frequent bus services passing through Ainsdale are provided by Arriva North West, including:
• 44/44A Crossens - Formby 
• 47 Crossens - Liverpool (20 minutes weekday daytime, less frequent evenings) 
• 49 Crossens - Woodvale (12 minutes daytime, half-hourly evenings, slightly less frequent daytime on Sundays) 

Stagecoach provides the X2, running from Preston through Tarleton, Banks, Southport, Birkdale, Ainsdale, Formby, Crosby and Bootle before finishing in Liverpool (half-hourly weekday daytime, restricted in evenings, early finish Sundays).

==Recreation and sports==

Sport in Ainsdale is represented in various streams such as football, cricket, bowls, pool and chess. The village is also the home of the famous Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club.

The football section of Ainsdale Sports and Social Club namely Southport &amp; Ainsdale Amateurs FC host teams from Under 6 up to Under 18 and Open Age Teams. The senior first team play in the Premier Division of the Mid Lancashire League. Ainsdale Cricket Club play in the successful Liverpool Competition. The club also has three All weather 3G pitches as part of its set up.

Ainsdale is also home to Hillside Lawn Tennis Club who play in the Southport Tennis League.

Every year at the start of July, Ainsdale Horticultural Society hold a village show. This popular local event showcases local growers produce in an horticultural competition and hosts many other events by local people.

Ainsdale beach is designated by Sefton Council as a kite beach where kitesurfing and land-based kite traction activities are allowed.

The Sefton coastal path, the Trans Pennine Trail and the King Charles III England Coast Path all pass through Ainsdale. A number of waymarked nature trails are also accessible from the town. These trails allow access to the Ainsdale Sand Dunes, designated as one of the national nature reserves in England. This nature reserve also comprises part of a Ramsar site.

The publisher Café Royal Books is based in the area.

<text>Španovica, known as Novo Selo under the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is a village in Pakrac, Croatia. It is located on the Pakrac–Požega main road, south of the Papuk mountain in western Slavonia. It has a population of 23, according to the 2011 Croatian census.

==History==
Španovica was established in the second half of the 19th century when Croats from Ravna Gora, in the mountainous region of Gorski Kotar, settled there. The surrounding villages were inhabited by ethnic Serbs.

The inhabitants of Španovica and their Serb neighbours coexisted peacefully until the outbreak of World War II, when the village became a stronghold of the fascist Ustaše movement, which began arresting Serbs from the surrounding area. In the summer of 1942, Ustaše official Vjekoslav Luburić oversaw the &quot;cleansing&quot; of the surrounding Serb villages, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Serb villagers and the deportation of many others to detention camps. Some residents of Španovica took part in these operations. That autumn, the Yugoslav Partisans captured Španovica from the Ustaše. Serb villagers whose relatives had previously been killed by the Ustaše subsequently burned most of the village to the ground, killing an undetermined number of Croat civilians and forcing the survivors to flee to the nearby town of Pakrac.

After World War II, Španovica was renamed Novo Selo and repopulated by Serbs from Bosnia. Its previous Croat inhabitants were prohibited from returning. During the Croatian War of Independence, Novo Selo was initially under the control of Croatian Serb rebels. It was captured by the Croatian Army in December 1991, and its Serb inhabitants fled. The village&#x27;s earlier name was subsequently reinstated. By 2020, only around a dozen of Španovica&#x27;s former inhabitants had returned to the village. That year, director Jadran Boban released a documentary film about Španovica and its history, titled &quot;Ono drugo selo&quot; ().

<doc id="1080691" wikidata="Q5642043" url="?curid=1080691" title="Haliburton Forest">
<text>Haliburton Forest &amp; Wild Life Reserve Ltd. is a forest in Haliburton County, Ontario. Forestry operations within the reserve are certified by the international Forest Stewardship Council in Canada. Haliburton Forest also supports ecosystem-based research projects, primarily conducted by the University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Forestry, and operates year-round recreation, tourism, and education programs.

==History==

In the British North American Province of Upper Canada, the northern townships of Peterborough County were first surveyed during the winters of 1862 and 1863. In 1885, 10 of these townships were sold to the London-based Canadian Land and Emigration Company under the leadership of Thomas Chandler Haliburton.

The company planned on subdividing its holdings into lots and selling them to British emigrants as farmland. These plans were soon canceled when it became obvious that the plots in question, with the exception of a few small parcels, were unsuitable for agriculture. The company went into receivership and was renamed the &quot;Canadian Land and Immigration Company&quot;, with headquarters in Toronto.

From 1870 to 1910, large lumber companies acquired cutting rights and cleared most of the white pine stands.

By the 1930s, up to remained in the hands of the Algonquin Corporation who continued harvesting timber until they were acquired by Hay and Co., a veneer milling company based in Woodstock, Ontario, in 1946. Between 1946 and 1971, more than of lumber had been sawn and several million more board feet of veneer left northern Haliburton for the mother mill in Woodstock. Most of this timber was cut on the land that today makes up Haliburton Forest.

By 1960, two forest inventories suggested that the harvestable volume of timber was rapidly declining on Hay and Co. lands, which had been taken over in the meantime by Weldwood of Canada. The decline in trees due to destructive harvesting methods and the sheer volume cut down during the past century left future milling to be deemed detrimental to the area and unprofitable. This eventually would lead to the land being put up for sale.

In 1962, German Baron von Fuerstenberg acquired the Weldwood property and renamed his holding Haliburton Forest and Wild Life Reserve Ltd. Previously, the lakeshores of Redstone and Kennisis Lakes had been sold off to a development company. The timber rights remained with the Weldwood mill until 1967 before being turned over to the new company. A few years later, in 1970, the sawmill at Kennisis Lake closed down.

==Fishing==
Several of the lakes within the park are home to native brook trout and lake trout. Four lakes (Stocking Lake, Dutton, No Name Lake, Wildcat Lake) are naturally reproducing Brook Trout lakes.

There are also several bass fisheries within the forest.

==Wolf Centre==

The Wolf Centre opened in July 1996 to the general public and is home to a pack of five timber wolves (Canis lupus). Within the enclosure (one of the largest in the world), they roam freely. Fed on a random schedule (approximately once a week), they can often be found near the viewing area due to it being close to both the highest point in the enclosure and the wolf&#x27;s water source.

Three months prior to the opening, Patricia Wyman, a new employee at the facility, was attacked by the wolves and died. Her body was found wearing nothing and featuring multiple mauling wounds.

==EcoLog Homes==

EcoLog Homes is a builder and supplier of log home kits. The logs they harvest come from the within Haliburton Forest &amp; Wildlife Reserve Ltd. Each season, mature hemlock becomes ready for harvesting, with some trees measuring up to thirty inches in diameter. Each tree is felled and skidded by horse before being transported to the nearby Haliburton Forest Mill. Each board is squared for timbers or sawn into boards for planking.

==Canopy Tour ==

The Canopy Tour experience, named &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot;, is offered to those who visit the reserve and includes the following: a guided van tour through the private lands of Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve Ltd. that passes through forests and along lakes and streams; a 0.5 km walk along the scenic Pelaw River: a short, guided voyageur-canoe ride across a wilderness lake to the final destination—Canopy Boardwalk. 

==Snowmobiling==
Haliburton Forest is the only wholly privately owned snowmobiling operation in the world, holding of forest wilderness, 50 lakes, and numerous ponds and creeks across the area. The core of the trail system is double-tracked and up to wide, with single-tracked trails that access some of the remote areas within the property. Half a dozen shelter cabins dot the forest, equipped with stoves and firewood.

==Dog sledding==

Both half and full-day dog sledding tours are available at Haliburton Forest along groomed winter trails with over 130 Siberian Huskies. Professional guides provide introduction to the basics of dogsledding.

==Mountain biking==
Many roads and forest trails are available for mountain bikers on the reserve, with the cycling season extending from Victoria Day to the weekend after Thanksgiving.

==Astronomy==
Due to its location three hours north of the lights of the Golden Horseshoe, Haliburton Forest is part of the Algonquin Dome, offering light-free viewing of the skies. This location allows astronomers to observe stars, galaxies, and deep-sky objects not normally observed in light-polluted locations.

Situated on a small rise near the entry point into the forest, an observatory offers an unobstructed view of the night skies. Much of the upper floor is reserved for telescopes and other astronomy equipment; however, the ground floor is open to visitors and is even set up for presentations.

There are two 10″ and one 12″ Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. They are self-tracking and equipped with computerized functions accessing a 64,000-object database.

==Sawmill tours==

The new Haliburton Forest sawmill opened to the public in 2010, and hosts tours featuring the milling process. 

==The Forest Festival==
The annual Forest Festival is held within Haliburton Forest and Wild Life Reserve.

<text>Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier () (30 March 1754 – 15 June 1785) was a French chemistry and physics teacher, and one of the first pioneers of aviation. He made the first manned free balloon flight with François Laurent d&#x27;Arlandes on 21 November 1783, in a Montgolfier balloon. He later died when his balloon crashed near Wimereux in the Pas-de-Calais during an attempt to fly across the English Channel. He and his companion Pierre Romain thus became the first known fatalities in an air crash.

==Early life==
He was born in Metz, the third son of Magdeleine Wilmard and Mathurin Pilastre, known as &quot;de Rozier&quot;, a former soldier who became an innkeeper. His interests in the chemistry of drugs had been awakened in the military hospital of Metz, an important garrison town on the border of France. He made his way to Paris at the age of 18, then taught physics and chemistry at the Academy in Reims, which brought him to the attention of the Comte de Provence, brother of King Louis XVI.

He returned to Paris, where he was put in charge of Monsieur&#x27;s &quot;cabinet&quot; of natural history and made a &quot;valet de chambre&quot; to Monsieur&#x27;s wife, Madame, which brought him his ennobled name, Pilâtre de Rozier. He opened his own museum in the Marais quarter of Paris on 11 December 1781, where he undertook experiments in physics, and provided demonstrations to nobles. He researched the new field of gases, and invented a respirator.

==Flight pioneer==

In June 1783, he witnessed the first public demonstration of a balloon by the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September, he assisted with the untethered flight of a sheep, a cockerel, and a duck from the front courtyard of the Palace of Versailles. French King Louis XVI decided that the first manned flight would contain two condemned criminals, but de Rozier enlisted the help of the Duchess de Polignac to support his view that the honour of becoming first balloonists should belong to someone of higher status, and the Marquis d&#x27;Arlandes agreed to accompany him. The king was persuaded to permit d&#x27;Arlandes and de Rozier to become the first pilots.

After several tethered tests to gain some experience of controlling the balloon, de Rozier and d&#x27;Arlandes made their first untethered flight in a Montgolfier hot air balloon on 21 November 1783, taking off at around 2 pm from the garden of the Château de la Muette in the Bois de Boulogne, in the presence of the king. Their 25-minute flight travelled slowly about 5½ miles (some 9 km) to the southeast, attaining an altitude of 3,000 feet, before returning to the ground at the Butte-aux-Cailles, then on the outskirts of Paris.
Along with Joseph Montgolfier, he was one of six passengers on a second flight on 19 January 1784, with a huge Montgolfier balloon &quot;Le Flesselles&quot; launched from Lyon. Four French nobles paid for the trip, including a prince. Several difficulties had to be overcome. The wallpaper used to cover the balloon&#x27;s envelope became wet because of extreme weather conditions. The top of the balloon was made of sheep- or buckskin. The air was heated by wood in an iron stove: to start, the straw was set on fire with brandy. (In other tests, charcoal or potatoes were used). The balloon had a volume around 23,000 m³, over 10 times that of the first flight, but it only flew a short distance. The spectators kneeled down when the balloon came down too quickly. That evening, the aeronauts were celebrated after listening to Gluck&#x27;s opera,&quot; Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;.

Rozier took part in a further flight on 23 June 1784, in a modified version of the Montgolfiers&#x27; first balloon christened &quot;La Marie-Antoinette&quot; after the queen, which took off in front of the King of France and King Gustav III of Sweden. Together with Joseph Proust, the balloon flew north at an altitude about 3,000 metres, above the clouds. They travelled 52 km in 45 minutes before cold and turbulence forced them to descend past Luzarches, between Coye and Orry-la-Ville, near the Chantilly forest. They set records for speed, altitude, and distance travelled.
==Final flight==
De Rozier&#x27;s next plan was an attempt to cross the English Channel from France to England. A Montgolfier balloon would not be up to the task, requiring large stocks of fuel for the hot air, so his balloon, the Rozière balloon, was a combination of a hydrogen and hot air balloon. It was prepared in the autumn of 1784, but the attempt was not launched until after another Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Blanchard, and his American companion, Dr. John Jeffries, flew across the channel in a hydrogen gas balloon from England to France on 7 January 1785.

Despite several attempts, De Rozier and his companion Pierre Romain were not able to set off from Boulogne-sur-Mer until 15 June 1785. At the take off, a nobleman tried to climb in the balloon with them, but Rozier persuaded him not to, saying it was too dangerous. After making some progress, a change of wind direction pushed them back over land some 5 km from their starting point. According to contemporary accounts, the balloon caught fire in midair before suddenly deflating and crashing near Wimereux in the Pas-de-Calais, from an estimated height of 450 m (1,500 ft). Both occupants were killed. Eight days later, his former fiancée died, possibly having committed suicide. A commemorative obelisk was later erected at the site of the crash. The King had a medal struck and gave his family a pension.

The modern hybrid gas and hot air balloon is named the Rozière balloon after his pioneering design.

<doc id="1080702" wikidata="Q16986354" url="?curid=1080702" title="History of Salt Lake City">
<text>Originally, the Salt Lake Valley was inhabited by the Shoshone, Paiute, Goshute and Ute Native American tribes. At the time of the founding of Salt Lake City the valley was within the territory of the Northwestern Shoshone, who had their seasonal camps along streams within the valley and in adjacent valleys. One of the local Shoshone tribes, the Western Goshute tribe, referred to the Great Salt Lake as &quot;Pi&#x27;a-pa&quot;, meaning &quot;big water&quot;, or &quot;Ti&#x27;tsa-pa&quot;, meaning &quot;bad water&quot;. The land was treated by the United States as public domain; no aboriginal title by the Northwestern Shoshone was ever recognized by the United States or extinguished by treaty with the United States. Father Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, a Spanish Franciscan missionary is considered the first European explorer in the area in 1776, but only came as far north as Utah valley (Provo), some 60 miles south of the Salt Lake City area. The first US visitor to see the Salt Lake area was Jim Bridger in 1824. U.S. Army officer John C. Frémont surveyed the Great Salt Lake and the Salt Lake Valley in 1843 and 1845. The Donner Party, a group of ill-fated pioneers, traveled through the Great Salt Lake Valley a year before the Mormon pioneers. This group had spent weeks traversing difficult terrain and brush, cutting a road through the Wasatch Mountains, coming through Emigration canyon into the Salt Lake Valley on August 12, 1846. This same path would be used by the vanguard company of Mormon pioneers, and for many years after that by those following them to Salt Lake.

==Early years==

On July 24, 1847, 143 men, three women and two children founded Great Salt Lake City several miles to the east of the Great Salt Lake, nestled in the northernmost reaches of the Salt Lake Valley. The first two in this company to enter the Salt Lake valley were Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow. These members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (&quot;LDS Church&quot;) sought to establish an autonomous religious community and were the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the area now known as Utah. Thousands of Mormon pioneers would arrive in Salt Lake in the coming months and years.

Brigham Young led the Saints west after the death of Joseph Smith. Upon arrival to the Salt Lake valley, Young had a vision by saying, &quot;It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.&quot; (This is commonly shortened to, &quot;This is the place&quot;). There is a state park in Salt Lake City known as This Is The Place Heritage Park commemorating the spot where Young made the famous statement.

Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.

Salt Lake City was originally settled by Latter-day Saint Pioneers to be the New Zion according to church President and leader Brigham Young. Young originally governed both the territory and church by a High council which enacted the original municipal orders in 1848. This system was later replaced with a city council and mayor style government.

After a very difficult winter and a miraculous crop retrieval, in which Pioneers reported to have been saved from cricket infestation by seagulls (see Miracle of the Gulls), the &quot;Desert Blossomed as the Rose&quot; in the Salt Lake Valley. Early Pioneers survived by maintaining a very tight-knit community. Under Young&#x27;s leadership Pioneers worked out a system of communal crop sharing within the various ward houses established throughout the Salt Lake Valley.
The California Gold Rush brought many people through the city on their way to seek fortunes. Salt Lake, which was at the cross-roads of the westward trek, became a vital trading point for speculators and prospectors traveling through. They came with goods from the East, such as clothing and other manufactured items, trading with the local farmers for fresh livestock and crops.

The Congress organized the Utah Territory out of the &quot;State of Deseret&quot; in 1850, and a few months later on January 6, 1851, the city was formally organized as &quot;The City of the Great Salt Lake&quot;. Originally, Fillmore, Utah was the territorial capital, but in 1856 it was moved to Salt Lake City, where it has stayed ever since.

In 1855 Congress directed the President of the United States to appoint a surveyor general for Utah Territory, and to cause that the lands of that territory should be surveyed preparatory to bringing them on the market. Certain sections were to be reserved for the benefit of schools and a university in the territory. The surveyor general arrived in Utah in July of the same year to begin surveying. He established the initial point for his survey (base line and meridian) at the southeast corner of the Temple Block, and from there extended that survey over 2 million acres. Because of numerous conflicts between the surveyor and the territorial government the first surveyor general abandoned his post in 1857. His successors recommended that no additional land be surveyed. Conflict between the federal and territorial governments kept the issue on hold until 1868, and in the meantime, large sections of the territory were transferred to neighboring territories and states. Again in 1868, Congress directed the President to appoint a surveyor general in the Utah Territory, to establish a land office in Salt Lake City, and to extend the federal land laws over the same. The land office opened 9 March 1869.
In 1857, when the Mormon practice of polygamy came to national awareness, President James Buchanan responded to public outcry by sending an army of 2500 soldiers, called the Utah Expedition, to investigate the LDS Church and install a non-LDS governor to replace Brigham Young. In response, Brigham Young imposed martial law, sending the Utah militia to harass the soldiers, a conflict called the Utah War. Young eventually surrendered to federal control when the new territorial governor, Alfred Cumming, arrived in Salt Lake City on April 12, 1858. Most troops pulled out at the beginning of the American Civil War.

In order to secure the road to California during the Civil War, more troops arrived under the command of Colonel Patrick Edward Connor in 1862. They settled in the Fort Douglas area east of the city. Thoroughly anti-LDS, Connor viewed the people with disdain, calling them, &quot;a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics, and whores.&quot; To dilute their influence he worked with non-LDS business and bank owners, and also encouraged mining. In 1863 some of his troops discovered rich veins of gold and silver in the Wasatch Mountains.

In 1866, Thomas Coleman, a Black Mormon man, was murdered, and his body was left on Capitol Hill with an anti-miscegenation warning attached to his body. In 1883, Sam Joe Harvey, another Black man, was lynched for allegedly shooting a police officer, and his body was dragged down State Street.

In 1868 Brigham Young founded the Zion&#x27;s Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) as a way to ward off dependency on outside goods and arguably to hinder ex-LDS retailers. Although ZCMI is sometimes credited with being the nation&#x27;s first department store, a decade earlier New York City&#x27;s &quot;Marble Palace&quot; and Macy&#x27;s vied for that title.

Change was inevitable. The world started to come to Salt Lake City in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States at Promontory Summit, north of the city. By 1870, Salt Lake had been linked to it via the Utah Central Rail Road. People began to pour into Salt Lake seeking opportunities in mining and other industries.
City government was dominated by the People&#x27;s Party until 1890. The non-national People&#x27;s Party was an LDS-controlled political organization, and each of the early mayors of Salt Lake City was LDS. Sparks often flew between LDS city government and non-LDS federal authorities stationed just outside Salt Lake. A dramatic example occurred in 1874 when city police were arrested by US Marshals, who took control of the national election being held in Salt Lake City. Mayor Daniel H. Wells, a member of the LDS Church First Presidency, declared martial law from the balcony of the Old Salt Lake City Hall. Federal troops arrested the mayor, but he was soon released.

In the 1880s, the anti-polygamy Edmunds-Tucker Act systematically denied many prominent LDS Church members the right to vote or hold office. Polygamists were detained in a Federal prison just outside Salt Lake in the Sugar House area. Consequentially, the non-LDS Liberal Party took control of City government in the 1890 election. Three years later the Liberal Party and People&#x27;s Party dissolved into national parties anticipating Utah statehood, but both LDS and non-LDS leaders would govern Salt Lake City from that point onward.

The city became Utah&#x27;s state capital on January 4, 1896, when Utah entered the union upon President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s decree after the LDS Church agreed to ban polygamy in 1890.

==The 20th Century==
In 1907, Salt Lake City was home to Industrial Workers of the World Industrial Union No. 202.

The city adopted a non-partisan city council in 1911. As LDS/non-LDS tensions eased people began to work together for the common good, improving roads, utilities and public healthcare.

The Great Depression hit Salt Lake City especially hard. At its peak, the unemployment rate reached 61,500 people, about 36%. The annual per capita income in 1932 was $276, half of what it was in 1929, $537 annually. Jobs were scarce. Although boosted by federal New Deal programs as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the economy did not fully recover until World War II.

After suffering through the depression Salt Lake&#x27;s economy was boosted during World War II due to the influx of defense industries to the Wasatch Front. Demands for raw materials increased Utah&#x27;s mining industry, and several military installations such as Fort Douglas and Hill Air Force Base were added.

After the Second World War, Salt Lake City grew rapidly. It began to suffer some of the same problems other cities face. Urban sprawl became a growing problem due to a combination of rapid growth and an abundance of available land. Military and aerospace also became dominant industries.

Salt Lake began its bid for the Winter Olympics as early as the 1930s, when the Utah Ski Club tried to bring the games to the valley. At the time, however, the Summer Olympic host city had the option of hosting the winter games, and all attempts failed. Salt Lake tried again throughout the decades until 1995, when the International Olympic Committee announced Salt Lake City as the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics.

After 132 years in business, ZCMI was sold to the May Department Stores Company in 1999. Remaining ZCMI stores, including one in downtown Salt Lake City, were converted into Meier &amp; Frank stores, although the facade still reads &quot;1868 ZCMI 1999&quot;.

In April 1999, the Salt Lake City council voted 5 to 2 along LDS membership lines to sell to the LDS Church the segment of Main Street that lay between Temple Square and the LDS Church office buildings for $8.1 million. The Church planned to build a large plaza on the land as well as a parking structure below. There was much public outcry about the sale of public lands to a private organization, but a Church representative assured residents that the plaza would be a &quot;little bit of Paris&quot;, a characterization that would be used against the LDS Church later. Concerns also lay in plans to ban such activities as demonstrations, skateboarding, sunbathing, smoking, and other activities it considered &quot;vulgar&quot;. The Utah ACLU believed that these restrictions were incompatible with the pedestrian easement that the city retained over the plaza. ACLU attorneys claimed this made the plaza into a public free speech forum. Nonetheless, the property was sold to become the Main Street Plaza. After the Utah District Court ruled against the ACLU, they were vindicated by the 10th Circuit Court in the Fall of 2002. Scrambling to satisfy residents, Rocky Anderson offered a plan for &quot;time and place&quot; restrictions on speech as suggested by the court. However, the LDS Church held firm to get the easement rescinded. Although &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; backed the mayor&#x27;s initial plan, the city council disliked it. In its place, Anderson offered to waive the easement in exchange for west side property from the LDS Church to build a community and a commitment of donations for it. All parties agreed to the arrangement, and the Main Street Plaza is now wholly owned by the LDS Church. Some suppose Anderson&#x27;s compromise was an effort to strengthen his 2003 re-election campaign among Latter-day Saints and west side residents. Both groups tended to have less favorable impressions of the former mayor.

==Today==

===2002 Winter Olympics and their legacy===
Much change occurred in the Wasatch Front due to the 2002 Winter Olympics. Scandal rocked the city when it was discovered that millions of dollars had been funneled into bribes to International Olympic Committee members. 

====The Games====
The games opened with the 1980 US hockey team lighting the torch and President George W. Bush officially opening the games at the Rice-Eccles Stadium set designed by Seven Nielsen. Closing ceremonies were also held at that venue.

Controversy erupted when in the first week the pairs figure skating competition resulted in the French judge&#x27;s scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier being awarded a second gold medal. Athletes in short-track speed skating and cross-country skiing were disqualified for various reasons as well (including doping), leading Russia and South Korea to file protests and threaten to withdraw from competition.

Heightened fear of terrorism following the September 11 attacks turned out to be unfounded, and the games proved safe.

The 2002 games ended with a dazzling closing ceremony, including bands such as Bon Jovi and KISS (who shared the stage with figure skater Katarina Witt).

Most of the 2,500 athletes paraded into Rice-Eccles Stadium, watching from the stands. Bobsledding bronze medalist Brian Shimer carried the American flag. Russia and South Korean both threatened to boycott the ceremony to protest what they felt was unfair judging, but showed up anyway.

====Legacy====
Many improvements were made to the area&#x27;s infrastructure. $1.59 billion were spent on highway improvements, including improvements of Interstate 15 through the city and new interchanges near Park City. A light rail system was constructed from downtown to the suburb of Sandy and later to the University of Utah.

The Athlete&#x27;s Village is now student housing at the University of Utah. Many venues in and around the city still stand even after the games.

Many hotels, motels and restaurants were built for the games and still exist today.

==Future==
Salt Lake City still somewhat struggles with its identity, trying to strike a balance between capitol of a major religion and modern secular metropolis. While founded by Mormons, the city is increasingly dominated by non-members, with its LDS population falling steeply and steadily since the 1990s. Considerable changes are being made to alter the downtown in adjustment to the phenomenal growth of the area. In the early 2010s, the LDS Church purchased the Crossroads and ZCMI malls and rebuilt them into the City Creek Center, which is connected by walkways, and with new high density residential and commercial buildings nearby. The commuter rail &quot;FrontRunner&quot; is in place along the northern Wasatch Front, with extensions planned for the southern portion of the region. Light rail extensions to the Trax system are ongoing to provide service to the western and southern parts of the valley, as well as to Salt Lake City International Airport. The controversial Legacy Highway has one segment completed (the Legacy Parkway), with the construction of the early phase of the next segment (the Mountain View Corridor) completed through the west side of the Salt Lake Valley.

<doc id="1080711" wikidata="Q7193931" url="?curid=1080711" title="Pilgrim Fathers Memorial">
<text>The Pilgrim Fathers Memorial is located on the north bank of The Haven at the site of the former Scotia Creek, Fishtoft, seaward of Boston in Lincolnshire, England, and consists of a small granite obelisk mounted on a granite block. It commemorates the attempt at finding religious freedom in September, 1607 by the Scrooby Congregation, a group of English Separatist Protestants who left for Holland. They were precursors of the Pilgrims who later crossed the Atlantic to New England.

==Connection to the Pilgrim Fathers==

The men from Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, chartered a Dutch vessel to transport them to the Netherlands in 1607, but the attempt was thwarted when the captain betrayed them to the local authorities. They were arrested and taken by boat to attend a hearing by the magistrates in the Boston Guildhall, and they were imprisoned in the cells there for about a month.

In 1608, after their release, they made a second, this time successful, attempt from the Humber first arriving in Amsterdam. The Scrooby congregation moved to Leiden in 1609, before setting sail in 1620 for the New World via Southampton and Plymouth.

==The memorial==

The memorial was erected by the former Boston Borough Council in 1957, on the 350th anniversary of the event. The work was carried out by Leake&#x27;s Masonry. The ceremony was attended by several members of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, who made a donation towards the cost of the monument. Its design is a tapering shaft rising from a base-block, intended to symbolise the urge which drove a small band of men and women to leave their country and kinsfolk for conscience&#x27;s sake. The material used typifies by its strength the power and stability of their faith.

The inscription on the front of the memorial used to read:

:&quot;&quot;Near this place in September 1607 those later known as &quot;The Pilgrim Fathers&quot; set sail on their first attempt to find religious freedom across the seas. Erected 1957&quot;&quot;
It has since been updated to the following:
:&quot;Near this place in September 1607 those later known as the Pilgrim Fathers were thwarted in their first attempt to sail to find religious freedom across the seas.&quot;
:&quot;Memorial re-worded by the generous gift of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches and The First Congregational Church of Wauwatosa WI USA - 2009&quot;

<text>Krishna Janmashtami (), also known simply as Krishnashtami, Janmashtami, or Gokulashtami, is an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. In certain Hindu texts, such as the &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;, Krishna has been identified as supreme God and the source of all avatars. Krishna&#x27;s birth is celebrated and observed on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in Shravana Masa (according to the amanta tradition). According to the purnimanta tradition), Krishna&#x27;s birth is celebrated on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in Bhadrapada Masa.

This overlaps with August or September of the Gregorian calendar.

It is an important festival, particularly in the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. The celebratory customs associated with Janmashtami include a celebration festival, reading and recitation of religious texts, dance and enactments of the life of Krishna according to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, devotional singing till midnight (the time of Krishna&#x27;s birth), and fasting (&quot;upavasa&quot;), amongst other things. Some break their daylong fast at midnight with a feast. Krishna Janmashtami is widely celebrated across India and abroad. 

== Etymology ==
The meaning of the Sanskrit word Janmashtami can be understood by splitting it into the two words, &quot;Janma&quot; and &quot;Ashtami.&quot; The word &quot;Janma&quot; means birth and the word &quot;Ashtami&quot; means eight; thus, Krishna Janmashtami is the celebration of Krishna&#x27;s birth on the eighth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Bhadrapada (August–September).

==History==
Information about Krishna&#x27;s life is noted in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana. Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and Vasudeva (father). Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was rampant, freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa&#x27;s life was threatened. Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were constrained by his uncle, Kamsa. During Devaki&#x27;s wedding, Kamsa was warned by a celestial voice that Devaki&#x27;s eighth son would be the cause of his death. In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth. The guards responsible for keeping watch over Devaki&#x27;s cell fell asleep and the cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna&#x27;s birth. These events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father). This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night.

Throughout Krishna&#x27;s childhood and young adult life, Balarama, Krishna&#x27;s half-brother, was a &quot;constant companion&quot; for him. Balarama joined Krishna in the major events that are celebrated in Vraja, Brindavan, Dravarka, and Mathura such as stealing butter, chasing calves, playing in the cow pens, and participating in wrestling matches.

==Observance and celebrations==

Krishna Janmashtami holds significant importance to Krishnaites as well as Hindus around the world, and it is celebrated in diverse forms depending on their regional and cultural customs. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples. The places of Mathura and Vrindavan are visited by pilgrims. Some mandirs organize recitation of &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; in the days leading up to Janmashtami. Many northern Indian communities organize dance-drama events called &quot;Rasa Lila&quot; or &quot;Krishna Lila&quot;. The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in the Mathura region, in northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami. People decorate their houses with flowers and light. On this day, people chant &quot;Hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna- Krishna Hare Hare&quot;. The Janmashtami celebration is followed by &quot;Dahi Handi&quot;, which is celebrated the next day.

After Krishna&#x27;s midnight hour birth, forms of baby Krishna are bathed and clothed, then placed in a cradle. The devotees then break their fast by sharing food and sweets. Women draw tiny footprints outside their house doors and kitchen, walking towards their house, a symbolism for Krishna&#x27;s journey into their homes.
===Northern India===

Janmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as Mathura where Krishna was born according to Krishnaism, and in Vrindavan where he grew up. Vaishnava communities in these cities in Uttar Pradesh, as well as others in the state, as well as locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan north celebrate Janmashtami. Krishna temples are decorated and lighted up, they attract numerous visitors on the day, while Krishna devotees hold bhakti events and keep night vigil.

The festival typically falls as the monsoons in north India have begun retreating, fields laden with crops and rural communities have time to play. In the northern states, Janmashtami is celebrated with the &quot;Raslila&quot; tradition, which literally means &quot;play (Lila) of delight, essence (Rasa)&quot;. This is expressed as solo or group dance and drama events at Janmashtami, wherein Krishna related compositions are sung, music accompanies the performance, while actors and audience share and celebrate the performance by clapping hands to mark the beat. The childhood pranks of Krishna and the love affairs of Radha-Krishna are particularly popular. According to Christian Roy and other scholars, these Radha-Krishna love stories are Hindu symbolism for the longing and love of the human soul for the divine or Brahman.

Poetry describing the feats of Krishna became popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries within the Braj region, and is written according to a vernacular called &quot;Braj basha&quot; (present-day &quot;Hindi&quot;/dialect of &quot;Hindi&quot;). The Braj basha poems of Surdas (collectively known as the &quot;Sursagar&quot;) are popularly recalled, some of which describe the birth and childhood of Krishna.

=== Jammu Region ===
In Jammu region, Janmashtami is popularly known by the name &quot;Thogre/Thakure da Vrat&quot; (meaning Vrat dedicated to Thakur i.e. Shri Krishna). Observing a &quot;Phalaahari Vrat&quot; for complete one day is the major ritual in the festival. The day is marked by numerous &quot;Phalaahari Dhaams&quot; or &quot;Bhandaras&quot; in the streets of Jammu region&#x27;s prominent towns.

Janmashtami marks the beginning of the kite-flying season in the Jammu region whereby locals gather and fly decorated kites from their rooftops. While on the other hand, girls and women decorate their palms by applying &quot;Teera&quot;, dye of an indigenous plant.

Another ceremony associated with Janmashtami in Jammu region is &quot;Deyaa Parna&quot; in which Dogras donate cereal grains in the name of their ancestors &amp; &quot;Kuldevtas&quot;. A holy tree called &quot;jand&quot; is worshipped by women on this day. Special rotis called &quot;draupads&quot; are prepared and offered to cows and deities.

=== Kashmir ===
Janmashtami is celebrated as &quot;Zaram Satam&quot; (Janam Saptami) by the native Kashmiri Pandits of Kashmir. The festival is associated with observing a &quot;vrat&quot; the whole day and visiting the &quot;Thokur Kuth&quot; (Krishna Mandir) at midnight. At night, &quot;puja&quot; is performed in the temples which includes performing &quot;abhishek&quot; (ritual bath) to the &quot;murti&quot; of Krishna, and singing &quot;bhajans&quot; (devotional songs). Food items appropriate for fasting, such as &quot;gaer&quot; or &quot;singhada lapsi&quot; (made from waterchestnut flour), fruits, and dried fruits are consumed on this day.

===Maharashtra===

Janmashtami (popularly known as &quot;Dahi Handii&quot; in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai, Latur, Nagpur and Pune. It is a celebration of joy and facilitator of social oneness. &quot;Dahi Handi&quot; is an enactment of how Krishna, during his childhood, would steal butter. This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life&#x27;s play is the manifestation of god.

It is common practice for youth groups to celebrate the festival by participating in &quot;Dahi Handi,&quot; which involves hanging a clay pot, filled with buttermilk, at a significant height. Once hung, several youth groups compete to reach the pot by creating a human pyramid and breaking it open. The spilled contents are considered as &quot;prasada&quot; (celebratory offering). It is a public spectacle, cheered and welcomed as a community event.

===Gujarat and Rajasthan===
In Dwarka, Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – people celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to &quot;Dahi Handi&quot;, called &quot;Makhan Handi&quot; (pot with freshly churned butter). Others perform folk dances such and &quot;garba&quot; and &quot;raas&quot;, sing &quot;bhajans&quot;, and visit Krishna temples such as at the Dwarkadhish Temple or Nathdwara. In the Kutch district region, farmers decorate their bullock carts and take out Krishna processions, with group singing and dancing. The day is of special importance to followers of the Pushtimarg and the Swaminarayan movement.

The works of Gujarati poets, Narsinh Mehta (1414–1480 c.e.), Dayaram (1777–1852) and Rajasthani poet Mirabai (c.1500), are popularly revisited and sung during Janmashtami. Their works are categorized as part of the &quot;bhakti&quot; tradition, or devotional poetry dedicated to Krishna.

===South India===
In Kerala, people celebrate in September, according to the Malayalam calendar.

In Tamil Nadu, people decorate the floor with kolams (decorative pattern drawn with rice batter). Geetha Govindam and other such devotional songs are sung in praise of Krishna. Little footprints, representing Krishna as an infant, are drawn from the threshold of the house till the pooja (prayer) room, which depicts the arrival of Krishna into the house. Reciting from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; is also a popular practice. The offerings made to Krishna include fruits, betel and butter. Milk-based items, such as sweet &quot;seedai&quot; and &quot;verkadalai urundai&quot;, are prepared. The festival is celebrated in the evening as Krishna was born at midnight. Most people observe a strict fast on this day.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, recitation of shlokas and devotional songs are the characteristics of this festival. Another unique feature of this festival is that young boys are dressed up as Krishna and they visit neighbours and friends. The people of Andhra Pradesh observe a fast too. Various kinds of sweets such as chakodi, murukku, and seedai are offered to Krishna on this day. Joyful chanting of Krishna&#x27;s name takes place in quite a few temples of the state. The number of temples dedicated to Krishna are few. The reason being that people have taken to worship him through paintings and not idols.

Popular south Indian temples dedicated to Krishna are Rajagopalaswamy Temple in Mannargudi in the Tiruvarur district, Pandavadhoothar temple in Kanchipuram, Sri Krishna temple at Udupi, and the Krishna temple at Guruvayur are dedicated to the memory of Vishnu&#x27;s incarnation as Krishna. It is believed that the &quot;murti&quot; (idol) of Krishna installed in Guruvayur is originally from his kingdom in Dwarka – which is believed to be submerged in the sea.

===Eastern and Northeastern India===
Janmashtami is widely celebrated by Krishnaite and Hindu Vaishnava communities of eastern and northeastern India. The widespread tradition of celebrating Krishna in these regions is credited to the efforts and teachings of 15th and 16th century Sankardeva and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Sankardeva introduced the musical composition, &quot;Borgeet&quot;, and dance-drama styles – &quot;Ankia Naat&quot; and &quot;Sattriya&quot; - that is now popular in West Bengal and Assam. In Manipur state, a traditional dance - &quot;Raas Leela&quot; - inspired by the theme of love and devotion between Krishna, Radha and the gopis, is enacted using the Manipuri dance style. The contextual roots of these dance drama arts are found in the ancient text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, but with influences from the culture fusion between India and southeast Asia.
On Janmashtami, parents dress up their children as Krishna or the gopis. Temples and community centers are decorated with regional flowers and leaves, while groups recite or listen to the tenth chapter of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Bhagavata Gita&quot;.

Janmashtami is a major festival celebrated with fasts, vigil, recitation of scriptures and Krishna prayers in Manipur. Dancers performing Raslila are a notable annual tradition during Janmashtami in Mathura and Vrindavan. Children play the &quot;Likol Sannaba&quot; game in the Meetei Krishnaite community.

The Shree Govindajee Temple and the ISKCON temples particularly mark the Janmashtami festival. Janmashtami is celebrated in Assam at homes, in community centers called Namghars (Assamese: নামঘৰ). According to the tradition, the devotees sing the &quot;Nam&quot;, perform pujas and sharing food and &quot;Prasada&quot;.

====Odisha and West Bengal====

In the eastern state of Odisha, specifically the region around Puri and in Nabadwip, West Bengal, the festival is also referred to as &quot;Sri Krishna Jayanti&quot; or simply &quot;Sri Jayanti&quot;. People celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; is recited from the 10th chapter, a section dedicated to the life of Krishna. The next day is called &quot;Nanda Ucchhaba&quot; or the joyous celebration of Krishna&#x27;s foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. Devotees keep fasting during the entire day of Janmashtami. They bring water from Ganga to bathe Radha Madhaba during their abhisheka ceremony. A grand abhisheka is performed at midnight for the small Radha Madha. In Odisha, the Jagannath Temple in Puri, best known for its grand &quot;Ratha Yatra&quot; celebrations, perform a &quot;Ratha Yatra&quot; during Janmashtami.

<text>Maui Dalvanius Prime (16 January 1948 – 3 October 2002) was a New Zealand entertainer and songwriter. His career spanned 30 years. He mentored many of New Zealand&#x27;s Māori performers, and was a vocal and forthright supporter of Māori culture.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Patea, Prime was of Tainui, Ngāpuhi, Ngati Ruanui, Tuwharetoa, Ngā Rauru, Pakakohi and Ngāi Tahu descent. The sixth of 11 children, Prime grew up in a musical household. He attended the Church College of New Zealand located in Temple View, Hamilton during his high school years.

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Prime moved to Wellington and worked as a cook by day and musician at night. His involvement with the Shevelles, a Māori female vocal trio from Porirua, lead to several trips to Australia.

In 1970, Prime travelled to Australia and performed at the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The dismissal of Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975 inspired the song &quot;Canberra, We&#x27;re Watching You&quot;, a cover of &quot;Washington, We&#x27;re Watching You&quot; by the Staple Singers with lyrics adapted to the situation.

In 1983 he formed his own production company, Maui Records. And he became increasingly involved with Māori music. In 1984, Prime recorded &quot;Poi E&quot; with the Pātea Māori Club. The album was very popular in New Zealand, attaining platinum certification.

He appeared in the film &quot;Te Rua&quot; in 1990 and sang the theme song &quot;Chudka Pā Poy&quot;, which is about apartheid.

He also worked closely with Ngoi Pēwhairangi, who helped develop Te Kohanga Reo, Māori language pre-school system. He provided the music for many of her lyrics.

==Advocacy==
Later, Prime became a campaigner for the return of mokomokai (preserved, tattooed human heads) from overseas museums.

Prime was an advocate for young people involved in court cases and victims of domestic violence.

At the 1999 general election, Prime stood for the Piri Wiri Tua Movement in the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate, placing seventh. During the campaign he endorsed Ken Mair who was running for the affiliated Mana Māori Movement.

==Death==
Prime died in 2002 in Hāwera after a long battle with cancer. He was buried in his family urupa at Nukumaru, South Taranaki, New Zealand.

<doc id="1080720" wikidata="Q191595" url="?curid=1080720" title="Togo national football team">
<text>The Togo national football team (French: &quot;Équipe nationale de football du Togo&quot;) represents Togo in international football and is controlled by the Togolese Football Federation. The national football team of Togo made their debut in the FIFA World Cup in 2006. Their team bus underwent a fatal attack in Angola prior to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. They withdrew and were subsequently banned from the following two tournaments by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). In 2013 for the first time in history, Togo reached the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. The team represents both FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
They made their first FIFA World Cup appearance in their history in 2006, having been coached throughout the qualifying campaign by Stephen Keshi; German coach Otto Pfister managed the team at the finals, despite having resigned three days before their first match over a players&#x27; bonuses dispute, only to be persuaded by the players to return. Prior to gaining independence in 1960, the team was known as French Togoland.

===2006 World Cup===
Togo lost their opening game of the World Cup, despite having taken the lead against South Korea through a goal by Mohamed Kader. In the second half, Jean-Paul Abalo was sent off after 55 minutes, and goals from Lee Chun-Soo and Ahn Jung-Hwan sealed a 2–1 defeat for Togo.

Togo&#x27;s next opponents in Group G were Switzerland, with the match scheduled for the afternoon of 19 June. However, the Togo squad and manager Pfister threatened to refuse to fulfill the fixture and take strike action. The squad and manager had been quoted as requesting payments from the Togolese Football Federation for participating in the tournament of around €155,000 (US$192,000) with added bonuses for victories or draws. FIFA negotiated with the squad and manager on 17 June, persuading them to travel to Dortmund in time to fulfill the fixture; goals from Alexander Frei and Tranquillo Barnetta resulted in a 2–0 defeat. FIFA subsequently imposed a CHF100,000 fine on the Togolese federation for &quot;behaviour unworthy of a participant in the World Cup.&quot;

Togo&#x27;s final group game against France ended in a 2–0 defeat.

===Sierra Leone air disaster===

After a 2008 African Nations Cup qualifier away to Sierra Leone on 3 June 2007, 20 members of a delegation of sports officials from Togo, including Togolese Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, were killed when their helicopter exploded and crashed at Lungi International Airport. No players of the Togo national team were among the victims. The Togo players and officials of the team had been waiting to take the next helicopter flight to the island on which the airport is located.

===2010 bus ambush and ban===

On 8 January 2010, the Togo team bus was attacked by gunmen as it travelled to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, killing three and injuring several others. The separatist group Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) claimed responsibility for the attack. Goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilalé was reported dead a day after the attack, though he actually survived. Such reports were later dismissed by his club GSI Pontivy in a press announcement, stating the player was actually undergoing surgery in South Africa.

Following the bus ambush attack, the Togolese Football Federation stated that they would withdraw from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations; despite claims that the team had since reversed the decision and would compete &quot;to show our national colours, our values and that we are men&quot; (as announced by Thomas Dossevi), the government later ordered that the team return home.

Following the team&#x27;s withdrawal, The Confederation of African Football (CAF) banned Togo from participating in the next two editions of the Cup of Nations and fined them US$50,000 because of the &quot;decision taken by the political authorities&quot;. The CAF executive Committee considered that the Togolese team was in &quot;forfeit notified less than twenty days before the start or during the final competition&quot; (Art. 78 of the Regulations for the Africa Cup of Nations), rather than having withdrawn (Art. 80), and refused to consider the circumstances as &quot;force majeure&quot; (Art. 87). Togo&#x27;s government immediately said they would sue as CAF &quot;have no consideration for the lives of other human beings&quot; and this is further &quot;insulting to the family of those who lost their lives and those traumatized because of the attack&quot;. FIFA has yet to comment on the issue. Togo footballer Thomas Dossevi said, &quot;We are a group of footballers who came under fire and now we can&#x27;t play football anymore. They are crushing us&quot;. Togolese captain Emmanuel Adebayor described the decision as &quot;outrageous&quot; and said that CAF President Issa Hayatou had &quot;completely betrayed&quot; the Togo squad. FIFA subsequently helped lifted their ban entirely.

As a result of the events, Emmanuel Adebayor announced his retirement from international football on 12 April 2010. But on 22 March 2011, Adebayor announced that he was again available for the national team.
===Fake Togo Team===
On 7 September 2010, Togo allegedly played Bahrain in a friendly losing the match 3–0. However, on 14 September, the Togo FA claimed that a fake team had played against Bahrain. Togo&#x27;s Sports Minister Christophe Tchao said to the &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; magazine that nobody in Togo had &quot;ever been informed of such a game&quot;. On 20 September 2010, it was revealed that former Togo manager Bana Tchanilé was the culprit and the Togo FA have given him a three-year ban in addition to the two-year ban he got in July 2010 for taking Togo players to play a tournament in Egypt. The match fixing has been linked to Wilson Raj Perumal and the Singaporean match-fixing syndicate allegedly run by Tan Seet Eng.

===2014 World Cup Qualification===
Togo began qualification for the 2014 World Cup on 11 November 2011, against Guinea-Bissau. They drew in the first leg 1–1. On 15 November 2011, they won the return leg 1–0. On 3 June 2012, they played Libya in Lome and drew 1–1. Shortly after on 10 June they played Congo DR at Kinshasa and lost 2–0. They resumed on 3 March 2013, and played Cameroon in Yaounde and lost 2–1. They met again on 9 June in Lome and Togo won 2–0. In the end, Togo failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels on two axles, two powered driving wheels on one axle and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive is often called a Jervis type, the name of the original designer.
==Overview==
The wheel arrangement type was common on United States railroads from the 1830s through the 1850s. The first to be built was the &quot;Experiment&quot;, later named &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;, for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad in 1832. It was built by the West Point Foundry based on a design by John B. Jervis. Having little else to reference, the manufacturers patterned the boiler and valve gear after locomotives built by Robert Stephenson of England. A few examples of Stephenson locomotives were already in operation in America, so engineers did not have to travel too far to get their initial ideas.

In England, the was developed around 1840 from the 2-2-2 design of Stephenson&#x27;s first Long Boiler locomotive, which he had altered to place two pairs of wheels at the front to improve stability, with the outside cylinders between them.

In the United States, the design was a modification of the design, then in common use. The proved to be too rigid for the railroads of the day, often derailing on the tight curves and rapid elevation changes of early American railroads. For the , Jervis introduced a four-wheel leading truck under the locomotive&#x27;s smokebox. It swiveled independently from the main frame of the locomotive, in contrast to the English engines which had rigid frames. The pistons powered a single driving axle at the rear of the locomotive, just behind the firebox. This design resulted in a much more stable locomotive which was able to guide itself into curves more easily than the .

This design proved so effective on American railroads that many of the early were rebuilt as . The excelled in its ability to stay on the track, especially those with the single driving axles behind the firebox, whose main virtue was stability. However, with only one driving axle behind the firebox, the locomotive&#x27;s weight was spread over a small proportion of powered wheels, which substantially reduced its adhesive weight. On locomotives which had the driving axle in front of the firebox, adhesive weight was increased. While this plan placed more of the locomotive&#x27;s weight on the driving axle, it reduced the weight on the leading truck which made it more prone to derailments.

One possible solution was patented in 1834 by E.L. Miller and used extensively by Matthias W. Baldwin. It worked by raising a pair of levers to attach the tender frame to an extension of the engine frame, which transferred some weight from the tender to the locomotive frame and increased the adhesive weight. An automatic version was patented in 1835 by George E. Sellers and was used extensively by locomotive builder William Norris after he obtained rights to it. This system used a beam whose fulcrum was the driving axle. On flat and level surfaces, the beam would be slightly raised, but upon starting or on grades, the resistance made the beam assume a horizontal position which caused the locomotive to tip upward.
A more practical solution, first put into production by Norris, relocated the driving axle to a location on the frame in front of the locomotive&#x27;s firebox. This was done because Baldwin refused to grant rights to Norris to use his patented &quot;half-crank&quot; arrangement. Cantilevering the weight of the firebox and the locomotive crew behind the driving axle placed more weight on the driving axle without substantially reducing the weight on the leading truck. However Norris&#x27;s design led to a shorter wheelbase, which tended to offset any gains in tractive force on the driving axle by reducing the locomotive&#x27;s overall stability. A number of Norris locomotives were imported into England for use on the Birmingham and Bristol Railway since, because of the challenges presented by the Lickey Incline, British manufacturers declined to supply.

Once steel became available, greater rotational speeds became possible with multiple smaller coupled wheels. Five years after new locomotive construction began with the 0-4-0 &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; of 1831, at the US West Point Foundry, the first locomotive was designed by Henry R. Campbell, at the time the chief engineer for the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railway. Campbell received a patent for the design in February 1836 and soon set to work building the first . Campbell&#x27;s was a giant among locomotives for the time. Its cylinders were , had diameter driving wheels, a boiler and weighed . Campbell&#x27;s locomotive was estimated to be able to pull a train of at on level track, outperforming the strongest of Baldwin&#x27;s 4-2-0s in tractive effort by about 63%. However, the frame and driving gear of his locomotive proved to be too rigid for the railroads of the time, which caused Campbell&#x27;s prototype to be derailment-prone.

As the 1840s approached and more American railroads began to experiment with the new locomotive type, the fell out of favor since it was not as capable when pulling a load. continued to be built into the 1850s, but their use was restricted to light-duty trains since, by this time, most railroads had found them unsuitable for regular work.
In England four-coupled and six-coupled engines performed well with freight work. However, the aim for passenger work was greater speed. Because of the fragile cast iron connecting rods, &quot;singles&quot; continued to be used, with the largest driving wheels possible.

For unclear reasons, British manufacturers did not take up the idea of mounting the forward wheels on a bogie for some years. There were possibly fears about their stability and with a long rigid frame, greater speed was achieved, albeit at the cost of a very rough ride and damage to the track. The culmination of this approach was seen in the Crampton locomotive where, to make the driving wheels as large as possible, they were mounted behind the firebox.

==Usage==

===South Africa===

In 1923, the South African Railways conducted trials with a prototype petrol-paraffin powered road-rail tractor and, in 1924, placed at least two Dutton steam road-rail tractors in service on the new narrow gauge line between Naboomspruit and Singlewood in Transvaal. The petrol-paraffin prototype and one of the latter had a wheel arrangement.

The prototype was a modified Dennis tractor which was fitted with a removable bogie between the front wheels to lift them high enough to prevent ground contact. A ball pin on the bogie fit into a socket in the front axle, and the bogie could easily be removed or replaced by running the tractor up a pair of ramps, placed on both sides of the track.

The production model was a modified Yorkshire steam tractor, fitted with jacks at the front to allow a separate bogie to be manoeuvred into position underneath the front axle to guide it on the rails. Without the bogie, the vehicle could still be driven on ordinary roads and had the advantage of being able to be detached and run around the train, without requiring special loops for that purpose. For reversing on the track, as when shunting, the rear wheels were modified to be steerable.

===United States===

The first railroad locomotive to operate in Chicago, Illinois was a , the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, which was built in 1837 by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Utica and Schenectady Railroad in New York. It was later purchased used by William B. Ogden for the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, the oldest predecessor of the Chicago and North Western Railway. The locomotive arrived in Chicago by schooner on 10 October 1848 and it pulled the first westbound train out of the city fifteen days later, on 25 October 1848.

<doc id="1080745" wikidata="Q108602" url="?curid=1080745" title="Susumu Tonegawa">
<text>is a Japanese scientist who was the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for his discovery of V(D)J recombination, the genetic mechanism which produces antibody diversity. Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology, Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training and he again changed fields following his Nobel Prize win; he now studies neuroscience, examining the molecular, cellular and neuronal basis of memory formation and retrieval.

==Early life and education==
Tonegawa was born in Nagoya, Japan and attended Hibiya High School in Tokyo. While a student at Kyoto University, Tonegawa became fascinated with operon theory after reading papers by François Jacob and Jacques Monod, whom he credits in part for inspiring his interest in molecular biology. Tonegawa graduated from Kyoto University in 1963 and, due to limited options for molecular biology study in Japan at the time, moved to the University of California, San Diego to do his doctorate study under Dr. Masaki Hayashi. He received his Ph.D. in 1968.

==Career==
Tonegawa conducted post-doctoral work at the Salk Institute in San Diego in the laboratory of Renato Dulbecco. With encouragement from Dr. Dulbecco, Tonegawa moved to the Basel Institute for Immunology in Basel, Switzerland in 1971, where he transitioned from molecular biology into immunology studies and carried out his landmark immunology studies.

In 1981, Tonegawa became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1994, he was appointed as the first Director of the MIT Center for Learning and Memory, which developed under his guidance into The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. Tonegawa resigned his directorship in 2006 and currently serves as a Picower Professor of Neuroscience and Biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.

Tonegawa also served as Director of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute from 2009 to 2017.

==Research==
=== Immunology ===
Tonegawa&#x27;s Nobel Prize work elucidated the genetic mechanism of the adaptive immune system, which had been the central question of immunology for over 100 years. Prior to Tonegawa&#x27;s discovery, one early idea to explain the adaptive immune system suggested that each gene produces one protein; however, there are under 19,000 genes in the human body which nonetheless can produce millions of antibodies. In experiments beginning in 1976, Tonegawa showed that genetic material rearranges itself to form millions of antibodies. Comparing the DNA of B cells (a type of white blood cell) in embryonic and adult mice, he observed that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around, recombined, and deleted to form the diversity of the variable region of antibodies. This process is known as V(D)J recombination.

In 1983, Tonegawa also discovered a transcriptional enhancer element associated with antibody gene complex, the first cellular enhancer element.

=== Neuroscience ===
Shortly following his Nobel Prize, Tonegawa again changed fields from immunology to neuroscience, where he has focused his research in the ensuing years.

Tonegawa&#x27;s lab pioneered introductory transgenic and gene-knockout technologies in mammalian systems. He was involved in early work demonstrating the importance of CaMKII- (1992) and the NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity (1996) in memory formation.

Tonegawa&#x27;s lab discovered that dendritic neuronal spines in the temporal cortex are a likely target for treatment of Fragile X Syndrome. With one dosage of the inhibitor drug FRAX586, Tonegawa showed a marked reduction of FXS symptoms in the mouse model.

Tonegawa was an early adopter of optogenetics and biotechnology in neuroscience research, leading to his groundbreaking work identifying and manipulating memory engram cells. In 2012, his lab demonstrated that the activation of a specific sub-population of mouse hippocampal neurons, labelled during a fear conditioning paradigm, is sufficient to evoke a behavioral response correlated with a precise memory trace. This demonstrated for the first time that memory information is stored in specific cellular ensembles in the hippocampus, now frequently called memory engram cells.

More recently, his lab continues to employ optogenetic technology and virus injection techniques to expand their findings on the engram cell ensemble. Notably, Tonegawa has uncovered the role of memory engram cell ensembles in memory valence, social memory, as well as their role in brain disorders such as depression, amnesia, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. These works provide proofs of concept for future medical treatments in humans through the manipulation of memory engram ensembles.

==Personal life==
Tonegawa currently resides in the Boston area with his wife, Mayumi Yoshinari Tonegawa, who worked as an NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) director/interviewer and is now a freelance science writer. The Tonegawas have three children, Hidde Tonegawa, Hanna Tonegawa, and Satto Tonegawa (deceased).

Tonegawa is a fan of the Boston Red Sox, and threw out an opening pitch during their 2004 World Series championship season.

<doc id="1080759" wikidata="Q15811187" url="?curid=1080759" title="GSM services">
<text>GSM services are a standard collection of applications and features available over the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) to mobile phone subscribers all over the world. The GSM standards are defined by the 3GPP collaboration and implemented in hardware and software by equipment manufacturers and mobile phone operators. The common standard makes it possible to use the same phones with different companies&#x27; services, or even roam into different countries. GSM is the world&#x27;s predominant mobile phone standard.

The design of the service is moderately complex because it must be able to locate a moving phone anywhere in the world, and accommodate the relatively small battery capacity, limited input/output capabilities, and weak radio transmitters on mobile devices.

==Accessing a GSM network==
In order to gain access to GSM services, a user needs three things:
* A billing relationship with a mobile phone operator. This is usually either where services are paid for in advance of them being consumed (prepaid), or where bills are issued and settled after the service has been consumed (postpaid).
* A mobile phone that is GSM compliant and operates at the same cellular frequencies as the operator. Most phone companies sell phones from third-party manufacturers.
* A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card, which is activated by the operator once the billing relationship is established. After activation the card is then programmed with the subscriber&#x27;s Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN) (the telephone number). Personal information such as contact numbers of friends and family can also be stored on the SIM by the subscriber.

After subscribers sign up, information about their identity (telephone number) and what services they are allowed to access are stored in a &quot;SIM record&quot; in the Home Location Register (HLR).

Once the SIM card is loaded into the phone and the phone is powered on, it will search for the nearest mobile phone mast (also called a Base Transceiver Station/BTS) with the strongest signal in the operator&#x27;s frequency band. If a mast can be successfully contacted, then there is said to be coverage in the area. The phone then identifies itself to the network through the control channel. Once this is successfully completed, the phone is said to be attached to the network.

The key feature of a mobile phone is the ability to receive and make calls in any area where coverage is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the Visitor Location Register (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new area, the &quot;Visitor&quot; Location Register must contact the &quot;Home&quot; Location Register to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called paging when the GSM network wishes to locate the mobile phone.

Every SIM card contains a secret key, called the Ki, which is used to provide authentication and encryption services. This is useful to prevent theft of service, and also to prevent &quot;over the air&quot; snooping of a user&#x27;s activity. The network does this by utilising the Authentication Center and is accomplished without transmitting the key directly.

Every GSM phone contains a unique identifier (different from the phone number), called the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This can be found by dialing *#06#. When a phone contacts the network, its IMEI may be checked against the Equipment Identity Register to locate stolen phones and facilitate monitoring.

==Voice all calls==

===All Outgoing===
Once a mobile phone has successfully attached to a GSM network as described above, calls may be made from the phone to any other phone on the global Public Switched Telephone Network.

The user dials the telephone number, presses the &quot;send&quot; or &quot;talk&quot; key, and the mobile phone sends a call setup request message to the mobile phone network via the nearest mobile phone base transceiver station (BTS).

The call setup request message is handled next by the Mobile Switching Center, which checks the subscriber&#x27;s record held in the Visitor Location Register to see if the outgoing call is allowed. If so, the MSC then routes the call in the same way that a telephone exchange does in a fixed network.

If the subscriber is on a prepaid tariff (sometimes known as &quot;Pay As You Go&quot; (PAYG) or &quot;Pay &amp; Go&quot;), then an additional check is made to see if the subscriber has enough credit to proceed. If not, the call is rejected. If the call is allowed to continue, then it is continually monitored and the appropriate amount is decremented from the subscriber&#x27;s account. When the credit reaches zero, the call is cut off by the network. The systems that monitor and provide the prepaid services are not part of the GSM standard services, but instead an example of intelligent network services that a mobile phone operator may decide to implement in addition to the standard GSM ones.

===Incoming calls===

====Gateway MSC contact====
When someone places a call to a mobile phone, they dial the telephone number (also called a MSISDN) associated with the phone user and the call is routed to the mobile phone operator&#x27;s Gateway Mobile Switching Centre. The Gateway MSC, as the name suggests, acts as the &quot;entrance&quot; from exterior portions of the Public Switched Telephone Network onto the provider&#x27;s network.

As noted above, the phone is free to roam anywhere in the operator&#x27;s network or on the networks of roaming partners, including in other countries. So the first job of the Gateway MSC is to determine the current location of the mobile phone in order to connect the call. It does this by consulting the Home Location Register (HLR), which, as described above, knows which Visitor Location Register (VLR) the phone is associated with, if any.

====Routing the call====
When the HLR receives this query message, it determines whether the call should be routed to another number (called a divert), or if it is to be routed directly to the mobile.

* If the owner of the phone has previously requested that all incoming calls be diverted to another number, known as the Call Forward Unconditional (CFU) Number, then this number is stored in the Home Location Register. If that is the case, then the CFU number is returned to the Gateway MSC for immediate routing to that destination.
* If the mobile phone is not currently associated with a Visited Location Register (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home Location Register returns a number known as the Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the Gateway MSC, and the call is forwarded there. Many operators may set this value automatically to the phone&#x27;s voice mail number, so that callers may leave a message. The mobile phone may sometimes override the default setting.
* Finally, if the Home Location Register knows that the phone is roaming in a particular VLR area, then it will request a temporary number (called an MSRN) from that VLR (using the IMSI as the reference number). This number is relayed back to the Gateway MSC, and then used to route the call to the MSC where the called phone is roaming.

==== Locating and ringing the phone ====

When the call arrives at the Visited MSC, the MSRN is used to determine which of the phones in this area is being called, that is the MSRN maps back to the IMSI of the original phone number dialled. The MSC pages all the mobile phone masts in the area that the IMSI is registered in order to inform the phone that there is an incoming call for it. If the subscriber answers, a speech path is created through the Visiting MSC and Gateway MSC back to the network of the person making the call, and a normal telephone call follows.

It is also possible that the phone call is not answered. If the subscriber is busy on another call (and call waiting is not being used) the Visited MSC routes the call to a predetermined Call Forward Busy (CFB) number. Similarly, if the subscriber does not answer the call after a period of time (typically 30 seconds) then the Visited MSC routes the call to a predetermined Call Forward No Reply (CFNRy) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.

If the subscriber does not respond to the paging request, either due to being out of coverage, or their battery has gone flat/removed, then the Visited MSC routes the call to a predetermined Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.

A roaming user may want to avoid these forwarding services in the visited network as roaming charges will apply.

===Voice charges===

In the United States and Canada, callers pay the cost of connecting to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber&#x27;s phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the North American Numbering Plan, callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and outgoing calls. For outgoing calls, any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, even though it is the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over &quot;local&quot; outgoing calls are popular.

Mobile networks in Europe, Asia (except Hong Kong, Macau (Macao) and Singapore), Australia, and Argentina only charge their subscribers for outgoing calls. Incoming calls are free to the mobile subscriber with the exception of receiving a call while the subscriber is roaming as described below. However, callers typically pay a higher rate when calling mobile phones. Special prefixes are used to designate mobile numbers so that callers are aware they are calling a mobile phone and therefore will be charged a higher rate.

From the caller&#x27;s point of view, it does not matter where the mobile subscriber is, as the technical process of connecting the call is the same. If a subscriber is roaming on a different company&#x27;s network, the subscriber, instead of the caller, may pay a surcharge for the connection time. International roaming calls are often quite expensive, and as a result some companies require subscribers to grant explicit permission to receive calls while roaming to certain countries.

===Speech encoding===
During a GSM call, speech is converted from analogue sound waves to digital data by the phone itself, and transmitted through the mobile phone network by digital means. (Though older parts of the fixed Public Switched Telephone Network may use analog transmission.)

The digital algorithm used to encode speech signals is called a codec. The speech codecs used in GSM are called Half-Rate (HR), Full-Rate (FR), Enhanced Full-Rate (EFR), Adaptive Multirate (AMR) and Wideband AMR also known as HD voice. All codecs except AMR operate with a fixed data rate and error correction level.

== Data transmission ==

The GSM standard also provides separate facilities for transmitting digital data. This allows a mobile phone to act like any other computer on the Internet, sending and receiving data via the Internet Protocol.

The mobile may also be connected to a desktop computer, laptop, or PDA, for use as a network interface (just like a modem or Ethernet card, but using one of the GSM data protocols described below instead of a PSTN-compatible audio channel or an Ethernet link to transmit data). Some GSM phones can also be controlled by a standardised Hayes AT command set through a serial cable or a wireless link (using IRDA or Bluetooth). The AT commands can control anything from ring tones to data compression algorithms.

In addition to general Internet access, other special services may be provided by the mobile phone operator, such as SMS.

===Circuit-switched data protocols===
A circuit-switched data connection reserves a certain amount of bandwidth between two points for the life of a connection, just as a traditional phone call allocates an audio channel of a certain quality between two phones for the duration of the call.

Two circuit-switched data protocols are defined in the GSM standard: Circuit Switched Data (CSD) and High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD). These types of connections are typically charged on a per-second basis, regardless of the amount of data sent over the link. This is because a certain amount of bandwidth is dedicated to the connection regardless of whether or not it is needed.

Circuit-switched connections do have the advantage of providing a constant, guaranteed quality of service, which is useful for real-time applications like video conferencing.

===General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)===
The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet-switched data transmission protocol, which was incorporated into the GSM standard in 1997. It is backwards-compatible with systems that use pre-1997 versions of the standard. GPRS does this by sending packets to the local mobile phone mast (BTS) on channels not being used by circuit-switched voice calls or data connections. Multiple GPRS users can share a single unused channel because each of them uses it only for occasional short bursts.

The advantage of packet-switched connections is that bandwidth is only used when there is actually data to transmit. This type of connection is thus generally billed by the kilobyte instead of by the second, and is usually a cheaper alternative for applications that only need to send and receive data sporadically, like instant messaging.

GPRS is usually described as a &quot;2.5G&quot; technology; see the main article for more information.

===Short Message Service (SMS)===

Short Message Service (more commonly known as text messaging) has become the most used data application on mobile phones, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide already as active users of SMS, or 2.4 billion people by the end of 2007.

SMS text messages may be sent by mobile phone users to other mobile users or external services that accept SMS. The messages are usually sent from mobile devices via the Short Message Service Centre using the MAP protocol.

The SMSC is a central routing hubs for Short Messages. Many mobile service operators use their SMSCs as gateways to external systems, including the Internet, incoming SMS news feeds, and other mobile operators (often using the de facto SMPP standard for SMS exchange).

The SMS standard is also used outside of the GSM system; see the main article for details.

== Supplementary Services ==
See also GSM codes for supplementary services.

* Call forwarding.
* Barring of Outgoing Calls.
* Barring of Incoming Calls.
* Advice of Charge (AoC). This GSM service estimates the call cost for display on the user&#x27;s mobile phone. This helps users by preventing bill shock and reduces the load on the mobile network operator&#x27;s customer service department. However, in practice, this GSM service is rarely used because the calculation is more complex than the standard allows. Instead, some operators provide subscribers with balance and/or call-cost notifications sent at predetermined times, such as at the beginning or end of every call. These notifications may be read out loud using a speech-synthesis system, or may be transmitted in textual form.
* Call Hold.
* Call Waiting.
* Multiparty service.
* Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP)/ Restriction (CLIR).
* Closed User Group (CUG).
* Explicit Call Transfer (ECT). This service allows a user who has two calls to connect these two calls together and release its connections to both other parties.

<text>All Pigs Must Die is an album by Death in June, released in 2001. The record consists of two parts: the first half of the album bears the typical later Death in June neofolk sound, whereas the second half of the album has a much more chaotic and noise-infused experimental sound to it.

The album was originally released as a limited edition LP on coloured vinyl; most copies of the 2000 released were pressed on a colour dubbed &quot;piggy pink&quot;, but a portion of these were pressed on pink vinyl with red spatters, in a variant dubbed &quot;bloody piggy&quot;. The album was also released on CD, and has since been made available on cassette and picture disc.

<doc id="1080765" wikidata="Q1972676" url="?curid=1080765" title="Portraits of Vincent van Gogh">
<text>The portraits of Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) include self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs—one of which is dubious—of the Dutch artist. Van Gogh&#x27;s dozens of self-portraits were an important part of his &quot;œuvre&quot; as a painter. Most probably, van Gogh&#x27;s self-portraits are depicting the face as it appeared in the mirror he used to reproduce his face, i.e. his right side in the image is in reality the left side of his face.

== Self-portraits ==

=== 1885 ===
On July 14, 2022, an almost certainly authentic self-portrait of van Gogh was uncovered under his 1885 painting &quot;Head of a peasant woman&quot;. Lesley Stevenson, a conservator at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, discovered it during an X-ray examination of their existing pieces. It shows a bearded van Gogh in a brimmed hat and a neckerchief around his throat. His left ear was clearly visible. The portrait is covered under layers of cardboard and glue, which experts are searching for ways to remove in order to confirm its authenticity. They believe it was painted when van Gogh moved to France and learnt about the work of the impressionists there, an experience that influenced his more colourful and expressive style that is much admired today. Van Gogh was known to often reuse his canvases or work on their reverse in order to save money. The X-ray image will be featured at a Royal Scottish Academy exhibit in Edinburgh and displayed using a specially made lightbox.

=== Paris 1886 ===
The first self-portrait by van Gogh that survived is dated 1886.
=== Paris 1887===
=== Arles===
=== Saint-Rémy ===
All the self-portraits executed in Saint-Rémy show the artist&#x27;s head from the left, i.e. the side with non-mutilated ear.
=== Auvers-sur-Oise ===
No self-portraits were executed by van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise, during the final weeks of his life.

== Remarks ==
* F208a: &quot;Self-Portrait with Dark Felt Hat&quot; is amongst the earliest of van Gogh&#x27;s self-portraits. It was discovered late in the family collection and was not exhibited before 1945. Opinions differ about the date and place of its execution. De la Faille thought it painted in Antwerp before 1886, while Hulsker thought it painted in Paris in spring 1886. Hendriks and Tilborgh opt for autumn 1886, based on its resemblance to van Gogh&#x27;s work that winter when he began to embrace Neo-impressionism. X-ray analysis reveals a nude figure study below. Since students did not work from nude models at Antwerp, this places the painting as executed in Paris where van Gogh had enrolled in Fernand Cormon&#x27;s &quot;atelier&quot;. There is no other work in van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; which complements this portrait, which has led to some authors such as Dorn questioning its authenticity. However Hendriks and Tilborgh are satisfied that the painting is consistent with others executed at the beginning and end of van Gogh&#x27;s first year in Paris. Marc Edo Tralbaut, van Gogh&#x27;s principal biographer, especially valorised the portrait, selecting it for the dust-jacket of his biography and stating that van Gogh had &quot;laid himself bare&quot; for the portrait. Tralbaut notes that van Gogh painted a number of self-portraits at this time, possibly because of his difficulty in getting models to sit for him. He was in poor health and his teeth were falling out, prompting him to grow a moustache to conceal them. At this time he was wearing city-clothes in an effort to stress his middle-class background as he strove to establish a conventional career for himself as an artist.
*F627: This painting may have been van Gogh&#x27;s last self-portrait, which he gave to his brother.
*F525: This painting may have been van Gogh&#x27;s last self-portrait, which he gave to his mother as a birthday gift. Van Gogh painted &quot;Self-Portrait without beard&quot; just after he had shaved himself (Hulsker thought it painted in Arles following his admission to hospital after mutilating his ear when he was also shaved, as can be seen in the &quot;bandaged ear&quot; portraits F527 and F529). The painting can be seen in the third (smaller) version of &quot;Bedroom in Arles&quot; at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. The self-portrait is one of the most expensive paintings of all time, selling for $71.5million in 1998 in New York. At the time, it was the third (or an inflation-adjusted fourth) most expensive painting ever sold.

== Provenances ==

*F476: Vincent van Gogh, Arles, (1888) gift; to Paul Gauguin, (1888–1897) sold. [Ambroise Vollard, Paris.] [Paul Cassirer Gallery, Berlin.] Hugo von Tschudi, Berlin, (1906–1911), by descent; to his widow, Angela von Tschudi, Munich (1911–1919), to Neue Staatsgalerie, Munich, (1919–1939); removed from the collection by the National Socialist (Nazi) authorities in 1938, (EK16554) consigned; to [Galerie Fischer, Lucerne, Switzerland, sale: Gemälde und Plastiken Moderner Meister aus Deutschen Museen, 30 June 1939, no. 45]; to Maurice Wertheim (1939–1951) bequest; to Fogg Art Museum, 1951. Notes: Gauguin sold the painting for Fr 300, Hugo von Tschudi bought the painting for the Nationalgalerie, Berlin, with funds from sponsors, but did not submit it to the Kaiser for pre-approval. He took the painting to Munich when he assumed post there.

==Scandals==
In Nazi Germany, Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s works were among those labelled generally &quot;degenerate art&quot;. Several works were seized and sold/or destroyed by NS authorities including the self-portrait dedicated to Paul Gauguin, September 1888, which was seized from the Neue Staatsgalerie in Munich, part of the Bavarian State Paintings Collections, to be sold at auction in 1939 in Lucerne, Switzerland, while other works by van Gogh could remain in this collection, but were kept under lock and key.

==Fakes==
Almost at the same time as when his &quot;Catalogue raisonné&quot; was published, Jacob Baart de la Faille had to admit that he had included paintings emerging from dubious sources, and of dubious quality. Shortly after, in 1930, De la Faille rejected some thirty odd paintings, which he had originally included in his catalogue – together with a hundred of others he had already excluded: &quot;Self-portraits&quot; – and &quot;Sunflowers&quot; – held a prominent place in the set he now rejected. In 1970, the editors of De la Faille&#x27;s posthumous manuscript brand marked most of these dubious &quot;Self-portraits&quot; as forgeries, but could not settle all disputes, at least on one:

* The &quot;Selfportrait &#x27;a l&#x27;éstampe japonais&quot;&#x27;, then in the collection of William Goetz, Los Angeles, was included, though all editors refused its authenticity.

Meanwhile, the authenticity of a second &quot;self-portrait&quot; has been challenged:
* The &quot;Selfportrait, &#x27;à l&#x27;oreille mutilée&quot;&#x27;, acquired in 1910 for the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo, had been unanimously rejected by scholars and technical researchers for decades, until provenance research by staff members reported &quot;pro domo&quot; the contrary. On January 20, 2020 the results of research into this painting were published, and the conclusion was that this is a real Van Gogh painting, painted in the time that he was in a mental institution.
Note the painter shows his right ear, if painted via a mirror, while Van Gogh cut his left ear.

<text>Whiskeytown was an American alternative country band formed in 1994 from Raleigh, North Carolina. Fronted by Ryan Adams, the group included members Caitlin Cary, Phil Wandscher, Eric &quot;Skillet&quot; Gilmore, and Mike Daly. They disbanded in 2000 with Adams leaving to pursue his solo career. Whiskeytown gradually expanded its sound outside the confines of alternative country while still maintaining its alternative roots.

The band released three albums. No two albums shared a consistent lineup; Adams and Cary remained the only constants.

== History ==
After performing punk rock with a band called The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams founded Whiskeytown in 1994 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The music of country-rock artist Gram Parsons served as his inspiration. The band initially consisted of Adams, violinist Caitlin Cary, drummer Eric &quot;Skillet&quot; Gilmore, bassist Steve Grothmann and guitarist Phil Wandscher.

=== &quot;Faithless Street&quot; era (1995–1996) ===
&quot;Faithless Street&quot;, released on Mood Food Records in 1995, established the band as one of the genre&#x27;s leaders, thanks to glowing reviews in publications such as &quot;No Depression&quot;, and helped the band score a major-label record deal with the Geffen Records imprint Outpost.

&quot;Faithless&quot; was re-released on the imprint in 1998 with nearly a dozen bonus tracks from the era. Among the bonus tracks were previously unreleased tracks and tracks that had been released on earlier albums and EPs, including &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; and &quot;Rural Free Delivery&quot;. One track, &quot;Oklahoma,&quot; was removed. Adams claimed that the reason for the re-release was the muddy sound of the original version and his distaste for &quot;Oklahoma,&quot; which was added to the album despite his objections.

=== &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; era (1997–1998) ===
Whiskeytown&#x27;s 1997 major-label debut, &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot;, helped to establish Adams&#x27; reputation as a songwriter. In the midst of the album&#x27;s recording, Gilmore and Grothman left, and Wandscher left soon after the album&#x27;s release. The band cycled through numerous members throughout the next year, including Jeff Rice and Steven Terry, both of whom were involved in the recording of &quot;Almanac&quot; but left later that year.

The band&#x27;s reputation preceded it in the live setting. In a 1997 &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; article titled Whiskeytown: half band, half soap opera, a June 1997 show at Mac&#x27;s Bar in Lansing, Michigan was described by fans as a half-baked performance.

Despite the band&#x27;s internal strife, &quot;Almanac&quot; was a successful album with critics, with the tracks &quot;16 Days&quot; and the Replacements-esque &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News&quot; receiving significant radio play. The positive reviews came from increasingly mainstream publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who claimed at the time, &quot;If there&#x27;s to be a Nirvana among the bands that are imprecisely dubbed alternative country, look to Whiskeytown.&quot; In January 1998, the band taped a live performance for &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

During the tour for &quot;Stranger&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, most of the band was fired or quit at a concert in Kansas City. The only people who started and finished the tour were Adams, Caitlin Cary, Mike Daly and tour manager Thomas O&#x27;Keefe.

=== &quot;Pneumonia&quot; and the band&#x27;s demise (1999–2001) ===
The band managed to add a new core member in multi-instrumentalist Mike Daly, who contributed significantly to the band&#x27;s sound on their third album, &quot;Pneumonia&quot;.

The album&#x27;s recording was a much different affair from the first two—likely because of the band&#x27;s constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country of the first two albums, especially &quot;Faithless&quot;, was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to Wilco&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Summerteeth&quot;. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including The Replacements&#x27; Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; James Iha.

Despite the album&#x27;s completion and Whiskeytown&#x27;s sizable fanbase, Outpost Records closed during the merger between Polygram and Universal, and as a result the album stayed in limbo for nearly two years, effectively ending the band.

Lost Highway Records, the roots-minded label imprint of Universal Music, picked up the album after signing Adams (who, in the interim, recorded his highly acclaimed debut solo record &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; on indie label Bloodshot Records) and released it in May 2001 [].

=== Post-Whiskeytown and talk of reunion ===
Since the band dissolved, most core members have chosen to remain active in music. Cary, who married original drummer Eric &quot;Skillet&quot; Gilmore, has released three solo albums and created a female folk trio named Tres Chicas. In 2010 she formed a duo group called The Small Ponds with Matt Douglas of Raleigh band The Proclivities. In 2013, Cary and solo artist Jon Lindsay co-founded the NC Music Love Army – a collective of many notable musicians from North Carolina who oppose the leadership of the newly emerged Republican supermajority in their home state. Between 2013 and 2014, the group has put out nine releases on their own label (Love Army Records), as well as thru Redeye Distribution and Bloodshot Records.

Adams has remained in the spotlight since the band&#x27;s breakup, releasing numerous solo albums, including three in 2005. In 2004, Adams founded Ryan Adams and The Cardinals, an alternative rock band. The band released several albums before disbanding in 2009. He has drawn considerable praise from such legends as Elton John and Phil Lesh for his songwriting. In February 2001, original Whiskeytown guitarist Phil Wandscher joined Adams at a Seattle show to perform two songs. It was the first time the two had appeared onstage together in 3½ years.

Adams and Cary have claimed to be reuniting Whiskeytown on multiple occasions, as recently as 2010, but nothing new has been released yet. He told an interviewer in January 2017 that he was writing a book about the band, but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytown. A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place. The band did reunite for a one-off, impromptu gig after one of Adams&#x27; shows in Raleigh, NC, in 2005. Gilmore, Cary, and Adams were joined on-stage by Adams&#x27; pedal steel player, Jon Graboff, and bassist Catherine Popper.

<text>Pembrey Sands Air Weapons Range is a Ministry of Defence air weapons range located near the village of Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, northwest of Burry Port and south of Carmarthen, Wales. Adjacent to the weapons range site is a former Royal Air Force station known as Royal Air Force Pembrey, or more simply RAF Pembrey, which closed in 1957 and of which part is now in civilian use as Pembrey Airport.

== History ==

=== RAF Pembrey ===

==== RAF Training Command ====

The site for Pembrey was acquired in 1937. The airfield was allocated to No. 25 Group RAF, of RAF Training Command during its construction, and it officially opened on the 6 May 1940. The site was known as Towyn Burrows and was only just higher than the high tide level. Situated between Burry Port and Kidwelly, it was on a marshy area of coastline, the Cefn Sidan Sands and Pembrey Forest were between the shoreline and the airfield.

The airfield opened in March 1939, and by September 1939 No. 2 Air Armament School RAF was the first unit to be stationed at the airfield, indeed, from September 1939 to June 1940 the airfield was used to train armourers and air mechanics by No. 2 AAS.

==== RAF Fighter Command ====

From the 20 June 1940, the airfield was transferred to No. 10 Group RAF of RAF Fighter Command. Pembrey was used throughout the Battle of Britain to rest squadrons from the defending against the Blitz, and also to provide air defence for South Wales and to protect convoys.

Supermarine Spitfire pilots of No. 92 Squadron used Pembrey as their base from the 18 June 1940. These included Squadron Leader Stanford Tuck, until 12 August, Geoffrey Wellum, the author of the 2002 memoir &quot;First Light&quot;, and Tony Bartley. During the Battle of Britain, No. 92 Squadron pilots who were to be at readiness at dawn, spent the night in a tent set up near the aircraft. No. 92 Squadron returned to RAF Biggin Hill on the 9 September, during the air battle’s peak.

From January to March 1941, 256 Squadron operated from Pembrey. In early 1941, No. 316 Polish Fighter Squadron was formed at Pembrey, inflicted losses on enemy aircraft, and moved on to RAF Colerne in June.

RAF Fairwood Common and RAF Angle had taken over the air defence of the South Wales area by the middle of 1941 and RAF Pembrey was allocated to RAF Flying Training Command.

==== RAF Flying Training Command ====
Between 1941 and 1945 Pembrey was host to the RAF&#x27;s No. 1 Air Gunners School, involving Bristol Blenheim and Vickers Wellington bombers and Spitfire fighter aircraft, and included experimental courses. From 1943 to 1945, Wing commander George Peter Macdonald, was the Commanding Officer of No. 1 Air Gunners School RAF, and the Station Commander of RAF Pembrey.

==== Operational Conversion Unit ====

No 233 OCU formed in September 1952, at RAF Pembrey. The OCU&#x27;s Badge featured the head of a Wildcat, indicative of the fierce fighting spirit. The OCU&#x27;s Welsh motto was &quot;Ymlaen&quot;; The English translation is &#x27;Forward&#x27;.

The OCUs de Havilland Vampire aircraft displayed the badge below the front quarter-light of the cockpit and was the OCUs aircraft&#x27;s only markings. The Station badge was also the No 233 OCU badge during this period, and was displayed on all the RAF Pembrey vehicles.

The Operational Conversion Unit disbanded in September 1957 and the station closed soon afterwards.

=== Incidents ===
*In June 1942, a &quot;luftwaffe&quot; Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft landed at RAF Pembrey in error, after a dog fight over the Bristol Channel. Oberleutnant Armin Faber, adjutant of III. fighter Gruppe of JG2, had been engaged by Supermarine Spitfire aircraft of No. 19 Squadron RAF and the Czech Wing, over south Devon, England, on 23 June. Being forced north beyond Exeter, Faber mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel. Short on fuel, he landed at Pembrey, believing it to be a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfield in the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, France. The Pembrey Duty Pilot grabbed a Very pistol, ran from the control tower, and jumped onto the wing of Faber&#x27;s aircraft as it taxied. Faber was taken to RAF Fairwood Common by Group Captain David Atcherley for interrogation. Faber was piloting the latest &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter aircraft, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-3, a type the RAF had only seen flying over France. The depths of Faber&#x27;s despair at providing his enemy with an intact Focke-Wulf Fw 190 can be gauged by the fact that he subsequently attempted to commit suicide. As news broke of his landing in Pembrey, RAF Fighter Command dispatched pilots to photograph and move the aircraft to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The RAF finally had an Focke-Wulf Fw 190 to compare with its V.S Spitfire IX and Hawker Typhoon Ia aircraft.

*In September 1953, a de Havilland Vampire crashed at the airfield, killing the pilot, Squadron Leader Lionel Hubert Wakeford, DFC. Shortly before closure in June 1957, a Hawker Hunter I, (WT563), crashed on approach to the airfield, killing Pilot Officer Frederick William Rupert Vernon Jacques when he ejected at low level; the aircraft crashed into Kidwelly railway station. Both airmen were buried in St Illtyd Churchyard, Pembrey, along with 32 wartime RAF casualties, including seven from the Polish Air Force.

*In 1968, a bomb exploded at the airfield, seriously injuring a warrant officer; in the &quot;climate of sporadic bomb threats&quot; the BBC interviewed people in Kidwelly about whether they believed the Prince of Wales should come to Wales.

=== Pembrey Airport ===

On 22 August 1997 Pembrey was officially opened as a civil airfield and named Pembrey Airport. Pembrey was associated as a service facility with the former RAF Pembrey Sands Air Weapons Range, a Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) establishment. The airfield is now split into a number of facilities: the Welsh Motor Sports Centre occupies most of the area, part of the land has reverted to agriculture, part contains a hangar formerly used by the Dyfed-Powys Police Air Support, whilst of the north east portion of the former RAF Runway, 04/22, was opened as Pembrey West Wales Airport in August 1997. In 2009 it was expecting to operate charter flights into the airport. The airfield is also home to the Llanelli Model Flying Club.

== Current operations ==

=== Pembrey Sands Air Weapons Range ===

Pembrey Sands Air weapons range is an air-to-ground bombing and strafing practice area. It also has a unique feature in that it can provide a beach environment to enable crews to establish a Temporary Landing Zone, to practise natural surface operations. A control tower and beach guard boxes are staffed to ensure the general public do not enter the Air Weapons Range. Accommodation and kitchen facilities are available. One hour after low tide, landings can take place day or night, meaning training can take place in the dark. Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft regularly used the airstrip. The first test sand landing of an Airbus A400M Atlas has been completed.

The facility has four Air Weapons Range targets; three are bombing targets and are used for both low-level attacks and dive-bombing. The fourth target is a strafe target, consisting of three strafe panels. Forward Air Control and Close Air Defence units use Pembrey AWR for realistic training. The range can also support Dry Training.

<text>Haydock is a village within the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, in Merseyside, England. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 11,416 Haydock&#x27;s historic area covers the Haydock electoral ward and a section of the Blackbrook ward.

Haydock is located within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire. The village is located to the north-east of the adjacent St Helens, with most of its residential estates and commercial property built either side of the A599. Historically a township and large pastoral area, Haydock was found to be rich with coal and the area grew in significance during the Industrial Revolution particularly with the coming of the canals and railways. In the 1930s, the north side of Haydock was bisected by the A580 East Lancashire Road; this dual carriageway connected the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, with several junctions serving St Helens and Haydock. The area to the south of the East Lancs road saw large post-war residential development, while the area to the north that was initially open pits and saw large scale industrialisation. More recently, the area north of the road has seen the development of distribution centres encouraged by the proximity of junction 23 of the M6 motorway and Haydock&#x27;s convenient transport links to Liverpool and Manchester.

Haydock is the home of the Haydock Park Racecourse, while the old mining tip and spoil areas south of the village have been developed into the Lyme &amp; Wood Pits Country Park.

==History==
The placename means &quot;barley, wheat&quot; with the suffix &quot;-aco&quot; meaning &quot;place&quot;. An undated source refers to the name as &quot;Heidiog&quot;. The village is often referred to by the colloquial name of &#x27;Yick&#x27;, and its inhabitants may be referred to as &#x27;Yickers&#x27; .

Haydock was one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s richest areas in coal and coal mining, Haydock Collieries had up to 13 collieries working at one time. The last colliery in Haydock – Wood Pit – closed in 1971, bringing to an end coal mining in the area. This site had been the scene of the Wood Pit disaster on 7 June 1878 which a subsequent report of the Inspector of Mines concluded claimed the lives of 189 men and boys. Among them were forty-five-year-old Nathan Boon and his five sons. According to GenUKI, 15 victims were not included in the Inspector&#x27;s report but their names &quot;appeared in the Coroner&#x27;s Inquest and in some cases in the burial registers&quot;. If included, the final death toll would have been 204.

The Old Boston Trading Estate was built atop the colliery of the same name in the north of Haydock. After the colliery was closed, due to an underground fire, the site was used for many years as a training centre for National Coal Board employees.

Surrounded by agricultural farmland, much of the village&#x27;s expansion was due to mining and canal transport. In the early 1900s, Haydock had no fewer than three railway stations–Haydock, Ashton-in-Makerfield, and Haydock Park–along the line which passed through from St. Helens to Lowton.

==Governance==
Haydock was a township in the parish of Winwick before being made a civil parish in 1866. The village was in the poor law union of Warrington in the 19th century before being created an urban district in 1894.

Between 1830 and 1983 Haydock was part of the Newton parliamentary constituency. In 1983 the Newton constituency, containing Golborne, Irlam and Newton-le-Willows urban districts, and Warrington Rural District (containing Winwick), was divided, and Haydock, along with Newton-le-Willows, was incorporated into the St Helens North Constituency.

The traditional Haydock boundary encapsulated part of Blackbrook, and part of Haydock Park (the northern perimeter made up by Garswood Park and the course of Clipsley Brook). The western boundary was Blackbrook, downstream of its confluence with Clipsley Brook, while the eastern boundary was composed of Sandy Lane and Newton Lane as far south as Dean Dam and Cowhey Dam. Portions of the old Haydock Parish are now within the modern Newton-le-Willows for the purposes of local administration and postal services, and utilise 01942 dial codes due to their proximity to those local exchanges.

Changing local administrative boundaries in 1933 transferred 16 acres of land to the Ashton-in-Makerfield civil parish which is, today, one of the seven parishes of St Helens.

Further ward profile changes in 2007 to those made in 2004 extended the Haydock ward, reducing the Billinge and Seneley Green Ward. Part of the Haydock Royal Air Force site housing development, including Slag Lane along with a section of Liverpool Road, was appropriated to Haydock and Blackbrook wards respectively, for electoral purposes. Seneley Green Parish Council continue to collect the parish precept and have authority on planning issues.

In January 2009 Haydock as part of the St Helens Metropolitan Borough agreed to form the Liverpool City Region, a Multi-Area Agreement enjoying greater devolved powers than local government. In 2014 this was established in statute as the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority covering the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the adjacent Borough of Halton.

==Community==
The Valley Brass Band, recipients of the King&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service, and formed in 1992 is significant in its community activities in the area, teaching approximately 120 children to play brass and percussion instruments. The band operate a community centre at a former primary school and support many local groups through this endeavour. The group have a close connection to Haydock Male Voice Choir and they perform regular concerts together.

Founded in 1923, the Haydock Male Voice Choir is one of the oldest choirs in North West England with a continuous record, apart from the early years of the Second World War. It performs in the UK as well as in Germany and the USA which the choir have visited many times. Current membership of 70 men is drawn from a 25-mile radius of Haydock. In recent times the choir has won a number of competitions including the Isle of Man festival of choirs 2019 and Choir of the festival in 2020. Since 2014 the Musical Director has been Dan Craddock, the 10th conductor in the choir&#x27;s 97 year history.

Before nationalisation of the coal industry in 1947, Haydock&#x27;s collieries were principally operated by Richard Evans &amp; Co, whose name can be found today in two of the village&#x27;s schools, Richard Evans Infant School and Richard Evans Junior School, which closed in 2006 due to falling pupil numbers. The school is now used as a music centre by the local Valley Brass Band who take their name from the Grange Valley area of Haydock.
The Haydock Brass Band, formed in 1861, is the oldest community run organisation in St Helens. It performs brass band music in contests, theatrical productions, performances with choral organisations and corporate events. It rehearses at Grange Valley Youth Centre, where the band has been based for the last five years. The band annually performs the ceremonial fanfares at the start and finish of the Grand National in Aintree. Haydock band has a strong relationship with Haydock Park Racecourse. It has one of the largest and oldest libraries of brass band music in the country.

Other schools in the area include Outwood Academy Haydock, Legh Vale Primary School, St. James&#x27; Church of England Primary, Grange Valley Primary School and English Martyrs Primary School. Outwood Academy Haydock was previously named Haydock Secondary Modern School and then Haydock High School. Haydock has many sport facilities including Haydock Park Racecourse, Haydock Cricket Club, Haydock leisure centre. Haydock is also home to Independent Futsal Club the first 5v5 Futsal Club in the county.

In 2007 a Tesco supermarket was built on the site of former coal industry workshops. This development led to the demolition of the old Conservative club building. Nearby are Iceland and Aldi supermarkets and other shops and restaurants. This area is now considered the main retail section of Haydock.

Haydock has a country park, known as the Lyme and Wood Pits Park. It is situated on the side of the hill that is home to the landfill site. In 2009 local schools from Haydock and Earlestown planted a variety of trees on the hill as part of the plans. The park includes many walks, ponds and a memorial to the 189 miners who lost their lives in the Wood pit explosion in 1878. Haydock Forest was awarded Green Flag status in early 2012.

King George V Playing Fields houses a play area and astro-turf pitch, and is home to Haydock Juniors and local open age football teams.
In 2009, Brazilian Soccer Schools was launched in Haydock for local junior players which grew and became a Football and Futebol de Salao centre for Lancashire and Merseyside.

Haydock is the home of the Haydock Park Racecourse. It was built between 1898 and 1899 on 127 acres of the historic Haydock Park land granted by Lord Newton to replace the older Newton le Willows course (home of the Newton Races) which was situated on Newton Common adjacent to Swan Lane and was closed in 1890. The origins of the Old Newton Cup can be traced back to 1752, when racing was taking place on Golborne Heath, not far from the present course. On 16 June that year a £50 Cup was competed for at Golborne, sponsored by the Newton Hunt. The races subsequently moved to Newton le Willows early in the 19th century.

Haydock has several churches:
== Transport ==
Haydock has transport links to Wigan, Ashton and St Helens via the 320. Some 320 buses terminate in Ashton and others in Wigan. There is also a number 20 bus that runs through Haydock, terminating at Earlestown. The 420 runs twice a day from Kenyons Lane South through to Halewood providing a direct link for Florida Farm Developments. Both of these services are run by Arriva. HTL buses (on behalf of Merseytravel) also operate in the area with the 156 which runs to Ashton Library and St Helens, and the 602 which operates between Newton Community Hospital and Ashton Heath, both running on evenings only. A few additional journeys on service 156 are operated by Hattons.

<doc id="1080804" wikidata="Q5513787" url="?curid=1080804" title="GMR (magazine)">
<text>GMR was a monthly magazine on video games that was published by Ziff-Davis — the publisher of such magazines as &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (later &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;). &quot;GMR&quot; was launched in February 2003, being sold in only the Electronics Boutique (EB) chain of video game stores. The magazine was unusual among multiconsole magazines in that it covered PC as well as console games, as well as its minimalistic cover art, and, in its last few months, its shift in focus toward promotion of less mainstream titles. It lasted exactly two years, as the 25th and last issue (which was only sent to subscribers) was the February 2005 edition (though prints were limited and not even all subscribers received the final issue).

As the magazine was funded by Electronics Boutique, the magazine stopped circulation when GameStop merged with EB Games, as GameStop already had its own magazine, Game Informer. The fates of its entire staff remain unknown, although James &quot;Milkman&quot; Mielke and Andrew &quot;Skip&quot; Pfister have transferred to the 1Up.com Network online.

Shortly after the release of the PS2 game Monster Hunter, an online-only Event Quest was released which allowed players to obtain the &quot;GMR Chrome Heart,&quot; a weapon prominently featuring an embossed GMR logo.

==Rating system==
When games were reviewed, they were rated on a scale of 1 to 10. (A score of 0 was twice used, for &quot;Postal²&quot; and &quot;Ping Pals&quot;.) A score of 9 or 10 was considered excellent, 7 or 8 good, 4 to 6 mediocre, and 1 to 3 bad. As well, the GMR Essential Selection logo would be awarded to all games scoring 10 and some games scoring 9. With the rating would come a one- or two-word comment, often a pun on the game&#x27;s title, and three lines of comparisons (usually &quot;Better Than:/Not As Good As:/Wait For It:&quot;).

Previewers would rate their excitement about an upcoming game on a scale of 1 to 5 flames, although one-flame previews were absent and two-flame previews rare.

==Game Geezer==
One of the most popular sections of the magazine was an editorial that appeared in the final pages of most every issue called &quot;Game Geezer&quot;. The editorial was written as though it were being dictated by an excessively cranky old man in a humorous tone and was well regarded by readers for its concise opinions and arguments regarding the video game industry and player community.

Game Geezer was later revealed to be written by Jeff Green, former editor-in-chief of Games for Windows: The Official Magazine and Computer Gaming World. The column was also written, on a fill-in basis, by former Xbox Nation editor Greg Orlando.

==&quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; controversy==
&quot;GMR&quot; suffered a black eye to its reputation with the publication of the August 2003 issue, which featured what was billed as the exclusive first review for the then highly anticipated Xbox action game &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;. The game was featured on the cover and given an excellent review, but at about the same time, the game&#x27;s developer made the decision to continue tweaking the game, delaying its release until early 2004. Thus, the &quot;GMR&quot; review was rendered invalid because it was based on a prerelease development version of the game.

<text>USS &quot;Gabilan&quot; (SS-252), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gabilan, an eagle ray of the Gulf of California.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gabilan&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut, on 5 January 1943. She was launched 19 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Eleanor James, wife of Rear Admiral Jules James, and commissioned on 28 December 1943, Commander K. R. Wheland in command.

== First and second war patrols, April – August 1944 ==
After completing its shakedown cruise out of New London, &quot;Gabilan&quot; sailed for brief antisubmarine training at Key West before transiting the Panama Canal for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived Pearl Harbor 23 March 1944 and spent her first war patrol (21 April – 6 June) scouting the Mariana Islands gathering information for the United States invasion of those islands. Her second war patrol (29 June – 18 August) took her to the south coast of Honshū, Japan, where, on the night of 17 July, she made a daring radar chase through bright moonlight and phosphorescent water. Skirting dangerous reefs and shoals, she pressed home an attack that sank a 492-ton minesweeper.

== Third and fourth war patrols, September 1944 – February 1945 ==
Her third war patrol (26 September – 12 November) took her south of the Japanese Empire in company with and to detect the departure from Bungo Suido of any major enemy fleet units that might interfere with the liberation of the Philippine Islands. The latter part of the patrol was spent in an independent search of approaches of Kii Suido where, in a dawn periscope attack on 31 October, she destroyed oceanographic research vessel &quot;Kaiyō No. 6&quot; with a single torpedo. Gabilan terminated her third war patrol at Saipan on 12 November 1944 and proceeded to Brisbane, Australia for refit.

Her fourth war patrol was in the South China Sea (29 December 1944 – 15 February 1945). She joined and in a coordinated patrol off the southern entrance to Palawan Passage and the western approach to Balapac Strait, where Japanese battleships &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot; were expected to appear en route to threaten American invasion forces in the Philippines. There were many quick dives to avoid aircraft; floating mines were sunk by rifle fire from the submarine, but there was no sign of their quarry.

Passing back through the Java Sea en route to Fremantle, Australia, the submarine had a nerve-wracking morning, as numerous aircraft dropped depth charges in the near vicinity, culminated by the appearance of a Japanese minelayer that made two attacks in shallow water, dropping 20 depth charges. Thoroughly shaken, but suffering only superficial damage, &quot;Gabilan&quot; evaded her antagonist in a providential heavy rain squall. Her only other diversion en route to Fremantle was an encounter with the British submarine , an approaching target in morning twilight; however, there was sufficient illumination to enable &quot;Gabilan&quot; to identify &quot;Spiteful&quot; at the last moment before firing.

== Fifth and sixth war patrols, March – August 1945 ==
&quot;Gabilan&quot; conducted the greater part of her fifth war patrol (20 March – 28 May) as a unit of a &quot;wolfpack&quot; that included and &quot;Besugo&quot;. Patrolling below the Celebes, the pack began an epic four-day chase on 4 April with a morning contact on cruiser &quot;Isuzu&quot; and her four escorts. One of the escorts fell prey to &quot;Besugo&quot;, and the elusive cruiser was spotted as she entered Bima Bay on the night of 6 April. Word was flashed to &quot;Gabilan&quot;, already executing a daring surface attack that left the cruiser listing and down by the bow. With the enemy confused by &quot;Gabilan&quot;″s attack, &quot;Charr&quot; completed the kill with a six-torpedo salvo the next morning (7 April). The demise of &quot;Isuzu&quot;, last of the Japanese light cruisers to fall victim to a submarine torpedo, was witnessed by British submarine .

&quot;Gabilan&quot; outwitted three escorts to sink a small freighter the morning of 14 April 1945, then scored hits on two cargo ships of another convoy. After a short stay off the coast of Hainan, where she destroyed drifting mines, she returned to Pearl Harbor 28 May for refit.
&quot;Gabilan&quot;&#x27;s sixth and last war patrol (20 June – 17 August 1945) was on lifeguard station for American fliers off Tokyo Bay. She first rescued six men, the crews of two torpedo bombers, then raced well inside Tokyo Bay, in easy range of Japanese shore batteries, to rescue another three-man crew. Six Navy Hellcat fighter planes gave her cover for the mission. On the way out, she paused to destroy a drifting mine with gunfire.

On 18 July 1945, the U.S. Navy destroyers and opened gunfire on &quot;Gabilan&quot; at a range of while &quot;Gabilan&quot; was on the surface in the Pacific Ocean off the Bōsō Peninsula, Honshu, Japan, at . &quot;Gabilan&quot; had difficulty diving in the heavy seas and broached, and the destroyers&#x27; gunfire straddled her an estimated ten times before she finally submerged undamaged to a depth of . As the destroyers approached, she descended to a depth of and broke contact with them.

On 1 August 1945, &quot;Gabilan&quot; rendezvoused with the submarine and received three British fliers &quot;Toro&quot; had rescued earlier. Altogether, &quot;Gabilan&quot; rescued 17 aviators during her patrol.

==Post-World War II==
En route to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Gabilan&quot; received news of the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. Proceeding by way of San Francisco, California, and the Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Gabilan&quot; arrived at New London, Connecticut, where she decommissioned 23 February 1946 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was sold for scrapping on 15 December 1959.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Gabilan&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service. Her second, third, fifth, and sixth war patrols were designated &quot;successful&quot;.

<doc id="1080807" wikidata="Q553493" url="?curid=1080807" title="Arthur Berger (composer)">
<text>Arthur Victor Berger (May 15, 1912 – October 7, 2003) was an American composer and music critic who has been described as a New Mannerist.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, of Jewish descent, Berger studied as an undergraduate at New York University, during which time he joined the Young Composer&#x27;s Group, as a graduate student under Walter Piston at Harvard, and with Nadia Boulanger and at the Sorbonne under a Paine Fellowship.

He taught briefly at Mills College and Brooklyn College, then worked briefly at the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and then for a longer period of time at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. In 1953 he left the paper to teach at Brandeis University where he was eventually named the Irving Fine Professor Emeritus. His notable students there included Gustav Ciamaga and Richard Wernick. He taught occasionally at the New England Conservatory during his retirement.

He co-founded (with Benjamin Boretz), in 1962, &quot;Perspectives of New Music&quot;, which he edited until 1964. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. He wrote the first book on Aaron Copland (reprinted 1990, Da Capo Press), and coined the terms &quot;octatonic scale&quot; and &quot;pitch centricity&quot; in his &quot;Problems of Pitch Organization in Stravinsky&quot;. He died in Boston, Massachusetts, age 91.

==Works==

His works show a preoccupation with vertical and horizontal musical space (see pitch space). His musical influences include Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and later Anton Webern. In the forties he composed neoclassical works including &quot;Serenade Concertante&quot; (1944) and &quot;Three Pieces for Strings&quot; (1945), and embraced the twelve-tone technique in the 1950s. His later works moved away from serialism but continued to use tone cluster &#x27;cells&#x27; whose pitch classes are displaced by octaves. George Perle has described his &quot;keen and sophisticated musical intellect&quot; and praised &quot;his serial music [for being] as far removed from current fashionable trends as his diatonic music was a few years ago.&quot;

Perle further praises his &quot;String Quartet&quot;: &quot;in the quartet, as in Berger&#x27;s earlier works, and in most of the great music of our Western heritage, timbre, texture, dynamics, rhythm, and form are elements of a musical language whose syntax and grammar are essentially derived from pitch relations. If these elements never seem specious and arbitrary, as they do with so many of the dodecaphonic productions that deluge us today from both the left and right, it is precisely because of the authenticity and integrity of his musical thinking at this basic level.&quot;

His works include &quot;Ideas of Order&quot;, &quot;Polyphony&quot;, &quot;Quartet for Winds&quot;, described by Thomson as &quot;one of the most satisfactory pieces for winds in the whole modern repertory&quot;, &quot;String Quartet&quot; (1958), &quot;Five Pieces for Piano&quot; (1969) and &quot;Septet&quot; (1965–66). He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Berger is grouped in the &quot;Boston school&quot; along with Lukas Foss, Irving Fine, Alexei Haieff, Harold Shapero, and Claudio Spies.

<text>The physics of skiing refers to the analysis of the forces acting on a person while skiing.

The motion of a skier is determined by the physical principles of the conservation of energy and the frictional forces acting on the body. For example, in downhill skiing, as the skier is accelerated down the hill by the force of gravity, their gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, the energy of motion. In the ideal case, all of the potential energy would be converted into kinetic energy; in reality, some of the energy is lost to heat due to friction.

One type of friction acting on the skier is the kinetic friction between the skis and snow. The force of friction acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, resulting in a lower velocity and hence less kinetic energy. The kinetic friction can be reduced by applying wax to the bottom of the skis which reduces the coefficient of friction. Different types of wax are manufactured for different temperature ranges because the snow quality changes depending on the current weather conditions and thermal history of the snow. The shape and construction material of a ski can also greatly impact the forces acting on a skier. Skis designed for use in powder condition are very different from skis designed for use on groomed trails. These design differences can be attributed to the differences in the snow quality.

An illustration of how snow quality can be different follows. In an area which experiences fluctuation in temperatures around 0°C - freezing temperature of water, both rain and snowfall are possible. Wet snow or the wet ground can freeze into a slippery sheet of ice. In an area which consistently experiences temperatures below 0°C, snowfall leads to accumulation of snow on the ground. When fresh, this snow is fluffy and powder-like. This type of snow has a lot of air space. Over time, this snow will become more compact, and the lower layers of snow will become more dense than the top layer. Skiers can use this type of information to improve their skiing experience by choosing the appropriate skis, wax, or by choosing to stay home. Search and rescue teams, and backcountry users rely on our understanding of snow to navigate the dangers present in the outdoors.

The second type of frictional force acting on a skier is drag. This is typically referred to as &quot;air resistance&quot;. The drag force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of a body (e.g. the skier) and the square of its velocity and density relative to the fluid in which the body is traveling through (e.g. air). To go faster, a skier can try to reduce the cross-sectional area of their body. Downhill skiers can adopt more aerodynamic positions such as tucking. Alpine ski racers wear skin tight race suits. The general area of physics which addresses these forces is known as fluid dynamics.

<doc id="1080819" wikidata="Q204944" url="?curid=1080819" title="Tupolev Tu-22M">
<text>The Tupolev Tu-22M (; NATO reporting name: Backfire) is a supersonic, variable-sweep wing, long-range strategic and maritime strike bomber developed by the Tupolev Design Bureau in the 1960s. The bomber was reported as being designated Tu-26 by Western intelligence at one time. During the Cold War, the Tu-22M was operated by the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) in a missile carrier strategic bombing role, and by the Soviet Naval Aviation (&quot;Aviatsiya Voyenno-Morskogo Flota&quot;, AVMF) in a long-range maritime anti-shipping role. 

In 2024, the Russian Air Force had 57 aircraft in service, according to the 2024 Military Balance report by International Institute for Strategic Studies. In 2023, Ukraine&#x27;s Main Directorate of Intelligence estimated that Russia had 27 aircraft in operable condition.

==Development==
In 1962, after the introduction of the Tupolev Tu-22, it became increasingly clear that the aircraft was inadequate in its role as a bomber. In addition to widespread unserviceability and maintenance problems, the Tu-22&#x27;s handling characteristics proved to be dangerous. Its landing speed was greater than previous bombers and it had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail upon landing. It was difficult to fly, and had poor all-round visibility. In 1962, Tupolev commenced work on major update of the Tu-22. Initially, the bureau planned to add a variable-sweep wing and uprated engines into the updated design. The design was tested at TsAGI&#x27;s wind tunnels at Zhukovsky.

During this time Sukhoi developed the T-4, a four-engine titanium aircraft with canards. A response to the XB-70, it was to have a cruise speed of , requiring a major research effort in order to develop the requisite technologies. Tupolev, whose expertise was with bombers, offered the Soviet Air Force (&quot;Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily&quot;, VVS) a massively updated version of the Tu-22.


Compared to the T-4, it was an evolutionary design, and thus its appeal lay in its simplicity and low cost. The Soviet government was skeptical about the need to approve the development of a replacement aircraft so soon after the Tu-22 had entered service. The Air Force and Tupolev, in order to save face regarding the Tu-22&#x27;s operational deficiencies and to stave off criticisms from the ICBM lobby, agreed to pass off the design as an update of the Tu-22 in their discussions with the government. The aircraft was designated Tu-22M, given the OKB code &quot;Aircraft 45&quot;, and an internal designation of &quot;AM&quot;. Their effort was successful as the government approved the design on 28 November 1967, and decreed the development of the aircraft&#x27;s main weapon, the Kh-22 missile. The T-4 itself made its first flight in 1972, but was later cancelled.

US intelligence had been aware of the existence of the aircraft since 1969, and the first satellite photograph of the bomber was taken in 1970. The existence of the aircraft was a shock to US intelligence as Nikita Khrushchev, who had been the Soviet premier up to 1964, was adamant that ICBMs would render the bomber obsolete.

As in the case of its contemporaries, the MiG-23 and Su-17 projects, the advantages of variable-sweep wing (or &quot;swing wing&quot;) seemed attractive, allowing a combination of short take-off performance, efficient cruising, and good high-speed, low-level flight. The result was a new swing-wing aircraft named &quot;Samolyot 145&quot; (&quot;Aeroplane 145&quot;), derived from the Tupolev Tu-22, with some features borrowed from the abandoned Tu-98 project. The Tu-22M was based on the Tu-22&#x27;s weapon system and used its Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22M designation was used to help get approval for the bomber within the Soviet military and government system.

The Tu-22M designation was used by the Soviet Union during the SALT II arms control negotiations, creating the impression that it was a modification of the Tu-22. Some suggested that the designation was deliberately deceptive, and intended to hide the Tu-22M&#x27;s performance. Other sources suggest the &quot;deception&quot; was internal to make it easier to get budgets approved. According to some sources, the Backfire-B/C production variants were believed to be designated &quot;Tu-26&quot; by Russia, although this is disputed by many others. The US State and Defense Departments have used the Tu-22M designation for the Backfire.

Production of all Tu-22M variants totalled 497, including pre-production aircraft.

===Modernization===
An initial attempt at modernizing the Tu-22M, &quot;Adaptation-45.03M&quot;, based on modernizing the aircraft&#x27;s radar, began in 1990, but was abandoned before reaching production. In 2007, work began on a new radar for the Tu-22M, the NV-45, which was first flown on a Tu-22M in 2008, with four more repaired Tu-22Ms refitted with NV-45 radars in 2014–2015.

A contract for a full mid-life upgrade, the Tu-22M3M, was signed in September 2014. The aircraft was then planned to receive a further modified NV-45M radar, together with new navigation equipment and a modified flight control system. A new self-defense electronic radar suite was to be fitted, replacing the tail gun of the existing Tu-22M3. Much of the new avionics were planned to be shared with the upgraded Tu-160M2. , armament was planned to be enhanced by adding the new Kh-32 missile, a heavily modified version of the current Kh-22, the subsonic Kh-SD, the hypersonic Kh-MT, or the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles. In 2018, deliveries of the Tu-22M3M were expected to begin in 2021.

On 11 May 2020, it was reported by TASS, citing anonymous sources in the military-industrial complex, that a test launch of a new hypersonic missile, not belonging to the Kh-32 family, was conducted from a Tu-22M3M. Reportedly, work on the missile had been initiated several years earlier, and its tests were expected to be completed &quot;simultaneously with the work on the upgraded Tu-22M3M bomber&quot;.

A separate, simpler, upgrade program (SVP-24-22) was being carried out in 2008 by the company Gefest &amp; T, based on avionics developed for the Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft, including a new computer, a new navigation system and digital processing for the aircraft&#x27;s radar. The upgrade is claimed to greatly increase navigation accuracy and bomb delivery. A SVP-24-22-equipped Tu-22M underwent trials in 2009, and the program was moved into production, with deliveries after 2012.

In September 2023, it was reported that the Tu-22M3 have been modified to carry a missile with a payload capacity of .

==Operational history==
=== Soviet Union ===
The two prototypes Tu-22M(0) were delivered to Long Range Aviation&#x27;s 42nd Combat Training Centre at Dyagilevo air base, near Ryazan, in February 1973. The aircraft began practice sorties in March. Within 20 days of the aircraft&#x27;s delivery, the air and ground crew at the air base had received their type ratings; this was helped by their earlier training at Tupolev, the Gromov Flight Research Institute and the Kazan plant. In June that year, the aircraft were demonstrated to Soviet government officials, destroying tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

The Tu-22M was first unveiled in 1980 during the aircraft&#x27;s participation in a major Warsaw Pact exercise. During the exercise, naval Tu-22M2s conducted anti-ship operations by mining parts of the Baltic Sea to simulate an amphibious landing. The exercise was extensively covered by the press and TV media. In June 1981, four Tu-22Ms were intercepted and photographed by Norwegian aircraft flying over the Norwegian Sea.

The first simulated attack by the Tu-22M against a NATO carrier group occurred between 30 September and 1 October 1982. Eight aircraft locked onto the U.S. task forces of USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and USS &quot;Midway&quot; which were operating in the North Pacific. They came within of the task forces. The reaction of the U.S. Navy was thought to have been restrained during this event so as to allow the observation of the Tu-22M&#x27;s tactics. The bomber also made attempts to test Japan&#x27;s air defense boundary on several occasions.
The Tu-22M was first used in combat in Afghanistan. It was deployed December 1987 to January 1988, during which the aircraft flew strike missions in support of the Soviet Army&#x27;s attempt to relieve the Mujahideens&#x27; Siege of Khost. Two squadrons of aircraft from the 185th GvBAP based at Poltava were deployed to Maryy-2 air base in Turkmenistan. Capable of dropping large tonnages of conventional ordnance, the aircraft bombed enemy forts, bases and material supplies. In October 1988, the aircraft was again deployed against the Mujahideen. Sixteen Tu-22M3s were used to provide cover to Soviet forces that were pulling out of the country. The Tu-22Ms were tasked with destroying paths of access to Soviet forces, attacking enemy forces at night to prevent regrouping, and to attack incoming supplies from Iran and Pakistan. Working alongside 30 newly arrived MiG-27s, the aircraft also flew missions aimed at relieving the besieged city of Kandahar. The aircraft had its last Afghan operation in January 1989 at Salang pass.

The Tu-22M suffered from widespread maintenance problems due to poor manufacturing quality during its service with the Soviet forces. The engines and airframes in particular had short service lives. The Air Force at one point sought to prosecute Tupolev for allegedly rushing the inadequate designs of the Tu-22M and the Tu-160 into service. This was compounded by the government bureaucracy, which hampered the provision of spare parts to allow the servicing of the Tu-22M. With some aircraft grounded for up to six months, the mission-capable rate of the aircraft in August 1991 was around 30–40%.

=== Russia ===

At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 370 remained in Commonwealth of Independent States service. Production ended in 1993.

The Russian Federation used the Tu-22M3 in combat in Chechnya during 1995, performing strikes near Grozny.

In August 2007, the Tu-22M and the Tu-95 began conducting long-range patrolling, for the first time since 1992.

On 9 August 2008, a Russian Tu-22MR reconnaissance aircraft was shot down in South Ossetia by a Georgian air defence Buk-M1 surface-to-air-missile system during the 5–day Russo-Georgian War. One of its crew members was captured (Major Vyacheslav Malkov), two others were killed and the crew commander, Lt. Col. Aleksandr Koventsov, was missing in action.

On 29 March 2013, two Tu-22M3 bombers flying in international airspace made a simulated attack on Sweden. The Swedish air defense failed to respond. Two Tu-22Ms flew supersonic over the Baltic Sea on 24 March 2015. Two Tu-22Ms approached Öland in international airspace on 21 May 2015. The Swedish Air Force sent two Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighters to mark their presence. On 4 July 2015, two Tu-22Ms approached the Swedish island of Gotland without violating its airspace, followed by Swedish and other fighter aircraft.
In 2014, Russian aerospace expert Piotr Butowski estimated there were seven squadrons of Tu-22Ms in service, each with approximately 10 aircraft, stationed at three airbases; 40 at Belaya airbase in southeastern Siberia, 28 at Shaykovka airbase southwest of Moscow, and 10 at Dyagilevo airbase in Ryazan southeast of Moscow which serves as the training unit for the bomber. 
====Syrian Civil War====
Since late January 2017, six Tu-22M3s resumed airstrikes in the area of Deir ez-Zor to prevent capture of the city by jihadists and again in late 2017 to support a government offensive. 22–31 January 2016, Tu-22M3s reportedly conducted 42 sorties performing airstrikes in the vicinity of Deir ez-Zor. On the morning of 12 July 2016, six Tu-22M3 bombers carried out a concentrated attack around Palmyra, Al-Sukhnah and Arak. On 14 July, six Tu-22M3 bombers operating from airfields in Russia delivered another massive strike on the newly detected IS facilities in the areas east of Palmyra, as well as in Al-Sukhnah, Arak, and the T-3 oil pumping station in the province of Homs. New raids were conducted on 21 July, 8 August, 11 August, and 14 August 2016.

On 16 August 2016, the bombers began to fly missions in Syria using Iran&#x27;s Hamedan Airbase.
In November 2017, six Tu-22M3s resumed airstrikes in the area of Deir ez-Zor to support a government offensive. On December 12, 2017, a fleet of Tu-22M3 bombers arrived back from Syria at Shaykovka air base near Kirov, Kaluga Oblast, where lieutenant general and long-range-aviation commander Sergey Kobylash awarded crews with the medal &quot;Participant of the military operation in Syria&quot;.

In May 2021, three Tu-22Ms were temporarily deployed to the Khmeymim airbase in Syria. Tu-22Ms were again deployed in eastern Mediterranean in June of the same year for large RF Navy and Air Force drills.

====Invasion of Ukraine====
On 15 April 2022, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry stated Russia had used Tu-22M3 bombers for the first time since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, to strike targets in Mariupol. It had earlier been reported that FAB-3000M-46 dumb bombs had been reactivated in Russia for use with Tu-22M3 bombers to strike targets at the Azovstal iron and steel works plant that became the last bastion for Ukrainian troops in the besieged city of Mariupol.

On 11 May 2022, a video emerged on social media showing a Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-22M3 bomber launching two Kh-22 missiles at targets somewhere in Ukraine.

On 5 December 2022, a Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-22M3 bomber, identified as &quot;RF-34110&quot;, was shown damaged as a result of a long-range drone attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine against the Dyagilevo air base. Images on social media showed at least the engine outputs and the trailing edge of the stabilizers damaged.

On 20 August 2023, the Russian government confirmed a drone attack on an airbase in Novgorod and BBC News subsequently published verified images of a Tu-22M3 engulfed in flames at Soltsy air base, Russia, which had been attacked by drones on the day before.

According to Ukraine, one Tu-22M3 was destroyed, and two were disabled, in an operation of a Ukrainian intelligence unit led by Oleh Babiy in August 2023.

During the 29 December 2023 Russian strikes on Ukraine and other attacks, some 300 Kh-22 missiles have been launched at Ukraine by Russian forces, all by Tu-22M bombers. None have been shot down by Ukrainian forces, although it is suggested that Russia has been targeting areas where there are no MIM-104 Patriot or SAMP/T missile batteries.

On 19 April 2024, a Russian Tu-22M3 crashed near Stavropol, over 450 km of distance from the nearest Ukrainian controlled territory as of the time of the event. Ukraine claimed to have shot down the long-range strategic bomber about 300 km from Ukraine as it was reportedly trying to return to base after a combat sortie. Russian authorities claimed the aircraft crashed in Krasnogvardeysky District due to a technical malfunction, killing one crew member, with another missing. A source claimed that Ukraine&#x27;s Main Directorate of Intelligence had planned and executed the downing with a S-200 missile, the same type of missile Ukraine claimed to have shot down a Beriev A-50 in February 2024. If confirmed, it would be Ukraine&#x27;s first downing of a Tu-22M in the air. Ukraine &quot;likely destroyed&quot; one Tu-22M at an airbase in Novgorod Oblast in August 2023, using drones.

HUR drones struck the Olenya air base in Murmansk Oblast, some 1,800 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, damaging two Tu-22M3s. A Ukrainian spokesman said, &quot;We can confirm the damage to two Tu-22M3 aircraft. We are talking about aircraft No. 33 and No. 31. No. 33 has holes in the upper part of the fuselage, and aircraft No. 31 also has some body damage.&quot;

On 15 August 2024, a Russian Tu-22M3 crashed and burned in the Irkutsk Oblast.

===Export===
The Tupolev company has sought export customers for the Tu-22M since 1992, with possible customers including Iran, India and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but no sales have apparently been made. Unlike the Tu-22 bomber, Tu-22Ms were not exported to Middle East countries.

During 1999, India reportedly signed a lease-to-buy contract for four Tu-22M aircraft for maritime reconnaissance and strike purposes, which were to enter IAF service in 2001. At the time, the aircraft were to be delivered with Kh-22 cruise missiles. As of 2023 there is no evidence of operation or acquisition by the Indian Air Force.

==Variants==

;Tu-22M(0)
: Earliest pre-production variant, 9 were produced.
;Tu-22M1
: Pilot-production aircraft, 9 were produced in 1971 and 1972. Its NATO reporting name was &quot;Backfire-A&quot;.
;Tu-22M2
: The first major production version, entering production in 1972, was the &quot;Tu-22M2&quot; (NATO: &quot;Backfire-B&quot;), with longer wings and an extensively redesigned, area ruled fuselage (raising the crew complement to four), twin NK-22 engines (215 kN thrust each) with distinctive intake ramps, and new undercarriage with the main landing gear in the wing glove rather than in large pods. 211 Tu-22M2 were built from 1972 to 1984. On November 1, 1984, the last Tu-22M2 of the 58th series rolled out of the factory gates. The Tu-22M2 had a top speed of Mach 1.65 and was armed most commonly with long-range cruise missiles/anti-ship missiles, typically one or two Raduga Kh-22 anti-ship missiles. Some Tu-22M2s were later reequipped with more powerful NK-23 engines and redesignated &quot;Tu-22M2Ye&quot;.

;Tu-22M3
: The later &quot;Tu-22M3&quot; (NATO: &quot;Backfire-C&quot;), which first flew in 1977, was introduced into operation in 1983 and officially entered service in 1989, had new NK-25 engines with substantially more power, wedge-shaped intake ramps similar to the MiG-25, wings with greater maximum sweep and a recontoured nose housing a new Almaz PNA (Planeta Nositel, izdeliye 030A) navigation/attack (NATO &#x27;Down Beat&#x27;) radar and NK-45 nav/attack system, which provides much-improved low-altitude flight. The aerodynamic changes increased its top speed to Mach 2.05 and its range by one third compared to the Tu-22M2. It has a revised tail turret with a single cannon, and provision for an internal rotary launcher for the Raduga Kh-15 missile, similar to the American AGM-69 SRAM. It was nicknamed &quot;Troika&quot; (&#x27;Trio&#x27; or third) in Russian service. 268 were built until 1993.

: As built, the Tu-22M included the provision for a retractable probe in the upper part of the nose for aerial refueling. The probe was reportedly removed as a result of the SALT negotiations, because with refueling it was considered an intercontinental range strategic bomber. The probe can be reinstalled if needed.

: Tu-22M3s used to attack targets in Syria underwent modernization, during which the SVP-24-22 specialized computing subsystems were installed on them, significantly increasing the accuracy of the bombing.

;Tu-22M4
: The development of the &quot;Izdeliye 4510&quot; began in 1983. It was a modernization with the installation of new NK-32 engines (from the Tu-160) and with a change in engine air intakes. The avionics were modernized by installing a new PNK, the &quot;Obzor&quot; (&quot;Overview&quot;) radar from the [Tu-160 and electronic warfare systems. The range of weapons was expanded: 3 Kh-32 or 10 Kh-15 (with placement on 6 internal and 4 external points of suspension) or UPAB-1500 with a television guidance system. In 1990, a prototype was built at the Kazan aircraft factory. Works in this direction were discontinued in November 1991. The prototype aircraft No. 4504 is in the museum exposition of the Dyagilevo air base.
;Tu-22MR
: Several Tu-22M3s, perhaps 12, were converted to Tu-22M3(R) or &quot;Tu-22MR&quot; standard with the Shompol side looking airborne radar and other ELINT equipment.
; Tu-22DP
: Tu-22DP (Dal&#x27;nego Perekhvata, long-range interception)/ DP-1 was a long-range interceptor project based on the Tu-22M2 (later on the basis of the Tu-22M3). R &amp; D was conducted by the AN Tupolev Design Bureau together with GosNIIAS. It was assumed that the DP could also carry strike weapons.
;Tu-344
: A canceled civilian supersonic aircraft based on the Tu-22M3, designed to carry . Developed by Tupolev Design Bureau (ANTK named after A. Tupolev) within the framework of conversion program in the second half of the 1990s. The development of the aircraft began in the 1990s with the emergence of interest and demand for supersonic business jets (SBJ). Since the creation of an aircraft from scratch requires a large investment, Tupolev Design Bureau decided to create an SBJ-class aircraft based on Tu-22M3. However, the project proved to be unpromising at the time, as the aircraft was supposed to be used internationally, but did not meet international environmental standards of the day.
;Tu-22M3 with SVP-24-22
: Modernized Tu-22M3 of the Russian Aerospace Forces fitted with a new sighting and computing system SVP-24-22 Gefest, instead of the NK-45 &quot;Vakhta-2&quot; complex. The SVP-24-22 includes a new and more powerful SV-24 onboard computer, UVV-MP-22 input-output device, flight information generation unit – BFI, aviation collimator indicator KAI-24, radio navigation system SRNS-24 with the A737 satellite receiver and the solid-state information storage device TBN-K-2 to save data of the navigation-targeting complex SVP-24-22 and of the flight recorder. 5 modernized aircraft entered service in 2015, 2 in 2017, 1 in 2018, 2 in 2019 and 2 in 2022.
;Tu-22M3M
: Tu-22M3 for the Russian Aerospace Forces with engines from Tu-160M2 (NK-32-02), 80 percent of avionics are replaced or upgraded, including SVP-24-22 bombsights, a phased array NV-45 radar, GLONASS navigation system, modern digital glass cockpit and engine controls, electronic warfare countermeasures, and the ability to use precision air-to-surface weapons. The modernization also counts with installation of mid-air refueling equipment, removed from existing aircraft in 1979 under the SALT II agreement, that will significantly increase the combat radius of the bomber. The Russian Ministry of Defense intends to upgrade up to 30 aircraft out of approximately 60 Tu-22M3s currently in service to the advanced Tu-22M3M variant. Can carry 3 Kh-32 or 4 Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles. Service life will be extended to 40–45 years. On 16 August 2018, the first modernized aircraft was unveiled during a roll-out ceremony at the Kazan Aviation Plant. It performed its maiden flight on 28 December 2018. On 20 March 2020, the second modernized Tu-22M3M aircraft had its maiden flight. On 27 May 2020, it was reported that an upgraded Tu-22M3M strategic bomber had undergone trials at supersonic speed during its fourth test flight out of five already conducted.

== Notable accidents and losses ==
* On 16 September 2017, a Tu-22M3 overran the runway at Shaykovka Air Base due to an aborted take off. The aircraft was written off. All four crew members survived without injury.
* On 22 January 2019, a Tu-22M3 crash-landed after a training flight while attempting to make a landing at the Olenya Air Base near the city of Olenegorsk in Russia&#x27;s Murmansk region. Three of the four crew members died in the crash. A video shows the aircraft making a hard landing, which instantly ruptured the airframe and detached the forward cockpit area.
* On 23 March 2021, a Tu-22M3&#x27;s ejection system malfunctioned, suddenly activating while still on the ground. The incident resulted in the deaths of three crew members and the hospitalization of a fourth. An official from Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry said that &quot;due to the insufficient altitude for parachute opening, three crew members received fatal injuries upon landing&quot;. The aircraft was at Shaykovka Air Base undergoing engine start procedures.
* On 19 August 2023, a Tu-22M3 was destroyed by a drone strike from the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive while on the ground at Soltsy-2 in Novgorod Oblast. Satellite pictures of the air base showed that the other bombers stationed there had been evacuated, while photographs taken on the ground showed the plane that had been hit by the drone ablaze and was completely destroyed by the resultant fire.
* On 19 April 2024, a Tu-22M3 crashed in the Stavropol region of Russia. Video shows the aircraft in a flat spin with visible flames on the rear of the aircraft. Ukrainian sources claimed that the bomber was shot down using a surface-to-air missile, with the loss of the Tu-22M3 being the second confirmed kill of a strategic bomber during the conflict.
* On 15 August 2024, a Tu-22M3 crashed in the Irkutsk Oblast of Russia while performing a &quot;routine flight&quot;. The preliminary cause of the crash is said to be a technical malfunction. According to the Ministry of Defense, the crew ejected before their plane crashed. Initially all crew were reported alive by Irkutsk Oblast Governor Igor Kobzev, however he later clarified that a pilot had died. The other crew members were in hospital with &quot;injuries of varying severity.&quot;

<text>The Ontario Bond Scandal was a criminal case that was brought against the former Ontario provincial treasurer, Peter Smith and Smith&#x27;s associates in 1924 and 1925.

Ontario had been governed by the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) political party, led by Ontario Premier Ernest C. Drury since 1919. In 1920, when Peter Smith was the Ontario Treasurer, the United Farmers leadership contracted with Aemilius Jarvis to acquire and retire three series of previously issued Succession Duty free bonds. The United Farmers lost their control of the provincial government in 1923, when a new Conservative government, led by Howard Ferguson, was elected a year later. 

Four years later in 1924, after the United Farmers government had fallen, prosecutors under the new provincial government alleged that former Treasurer Smith and financier Jarvis had conspired with Andrew Harvey (&quot;A.H.&quot;) Pepall, Smith&#x27;s friend and the government&#x27;s agent for the deal, to inflate the price paid for the bonds and to split the excess profit. An official inquiry discovered that the Jarvis firm had earned some pounds in profit from the arrangement. A very large portion of the profit had gone to Pepall as a commission, and a portion of Pepall&#x27;s commission had been deposited into Smith&#x27;s bank account. Criminal charges of theft, fraud and conspiracy to defraud were brought against Smith and Jarvis. A.H. Pepall who was then living in California, was not charged, but his brother Harry, and Jarvis&#x27;s son both of whom worked at the Jarvis firm, were criminally charged.

The only hint of any impropriety before this had arisen in 1922, when a legislative committee had questioned why A.H. Pepall, a close friend of Smith, had been paid the then large sum of $C80 per day for the trip, in which he seemed to have done little actual work. 

In October 1924 Smith, Jarvis, his son, and Harry Pepall went on trial. The verdicts were handed down on October 24, 1924. All four were found not guilty of theft and fraud. Harry Pepall and the younger Jarvis were also found not guilty of conspiracy. But, in an illogical twist, the elder Jarvis and Smith were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the government. Jarvis was sentenced to six months in prison, and Smith received three years. They were each joint and severally liable to pay a fine of , then the largest fines ever imposed in the British Empire. The fines were reduced on appeal and each was made separately liable for their portion.

The next year Andrew Pepall, who was living in California, was extradited. At that time conspiracy was not an extraditable offence, so he could only be brought back to Canada to face charges of theft and receiving the proceeds of a criminal conspiracy. He was found not guilty of these in late 1925.

Aemilius Jarvis -a prominent businessman and sports figure- was convicted on the charge of conspiracy, despite the fact that he had saved the provincial government millions of dollars in the retirement of the Succession Duty free bonds. Released from jail in six months, he spent the remainder of his life protesting his innocence which was proven when he took the stand, in the trial of Andrew Pepall. Jarvis was cleared in the eyes of the public, although his conviction was never overturned, nor was a pardon granted by the courts The Premier of Ontario (from 1919 to 1923), Ernest C. Drury, labelled Jarvis &quot;Canada&#x27;s Dreyfus,&quot; a reference to Alfred Dreyfus (who had been wrongfully charged and jailed in his native France for blatantly political reasons) and the Government of Canada would later be petitioned, unsuccessfully, to pardon Jarvis.

<doc id="1080823" wikidata="Q4348743" url="?curid=1080823" title="GSM frequency bands">
<text>GSM frequency bands or frequency ranges are the cellular frequencies designated by the ITU for the operation of GSM mobile phones and other mobile devices.

== Frequency bands==


== GSM frequency usage around the world ==

A dual-band 900/1800 device is required to be compatible with most networks apart from deployments in ITU Region 2.

=== GSM-900, EGSM/EGSM-900 and GSM-1800 ===
GSM-900 and GSM-1800 are used in most parts of the world (ITU-Regions 1 and 3): Africa, Europe, Middle East, Asia (apart from Japan and South Korea where GSM has never been introduced) and Oceania.

In common GSM-900 is most widely used. Fewer operators use GSM-1800. Mobile Communication Services on Aircraft (MCA) uses GSM-1800.

In some countries GSM-1800 is also referred to as &quot;Digital Cellular System&quot; (DCS).

=== GSM-850 and GSM-1900 ===
GSM-1900 and GSM-850 are used in most of North, South and Central America (ITU-Region 2).
In North America, GSM operates on the primary mobile communication bands 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. In Canada, GSM-1900 is the primary band used in urban areas with 850 as a backup, and GSM-850 being the primary rural band. In the United States, regulatory requirements determine which area can use which band.

The term &quot;Cellular&quot; is sometimes used to describe GSM services in the 850 MHz band, because the original analog cellular mobile communication system was allocated in this spectrum. Further GSM-850 is also sometimes called &quot;GSM-800&quot; because this frequency range was known as the &quot;800 MHz band&quot; (for simplification) when it was first allocated for AMPS in the United States in 1983. In North America GSM-1900 is also referred to as Personal Communications Service (PCS) like any other cellular system operating on the &quot;1900 MHz band&quot;.

=== Frequency mixing between GSM 900/1800 and GSM 850/1900 ===

Some countries in Central and South America have allocated spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands for GSM in addition to the common GSM deployments at 850 MHz and 1900 MHz for ITU-Region 2 (Americas). The result therefore is a mixture of usage in the Americas that requires travelers to confirm that the devices they have are compatible with the bands of the network at their destination. Frequency compatibility problems can be avoided through the use of multi-band (tri-band or, especially, quad-band) device.

The following countries are mixing GSM 900/1800 and GSM 850/1900 bands:

=== GSM-450 ===
Another less common GSM version is GSM-450. It uses the same band as, and can co-exist with, old analog NMT systems. NMT is a first generation (1G) mobile system which was primarily used in Nordic countries, Benelux, Alpine Countries, Eastern Europe and Russia prior to the introduction of GSM. The GSM Association claims one of its around 680 operator-members has a license to operate a GSM 450 network in Tanzania. However, currently all active public operators in Tanzania use GSM 900/1800 MHz. There are no publicly advertised handsets for GSM-450 available.

Very few NMT-450 networks remain in operation. Overall, where the 450 MHz NMT band has been licensed, the original analogue network has been closed, and sometimes replaced by CDMA. Some of the CDMA networks have since upgraded from CDMA to LTE (LTE band 31).

== Multi-band and multi-mode phones ==
Today, most telephones support multiple bands as used in different countries to facilitate roaming. These are typically referred to as multi-band phones. Dual-band phones can cover GSM networks in pairs such as 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies (Europe, Asia, Australia and Brazil) or 850 and 1900 (North America and Brazil). European tri-band phones typically cover the 900, 1800 and 1900 bands giving good coverage in Europe and allowing limited use in North America, while North American tri-band phones utilize 850, 1800 and 1900 for widespread North American service but limited worldwide use. A new addition has been the quad-band phone, also known as a World Phone, supporting at least all four major GSM bands, allowing for global use (excluding non-GSM countries such as Japan, South Korea and as well countries where 2G system was shut down to release frequencies and spectrum for LTE networks like Australia (since 2017), Singapore and Taiwan (since 2018).

There are also multi-mode phones which can operate on GSM as well as on other mobile phone systems using other technical standards or proprietary technologies. Often these phones use multiple frequency bands as well. For example, one version of the Nokia 6340i GAIT phone sold in North America can operate on GSM-1900, GSM-850 and legacy TDMA-1900, TDMA-800, and AMPS-800, making it both multi-mode and multi-band. As a more recent example the Apple iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S support quad-band GSM at 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, quad-band UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA at 850/900/1900/2100 MHz, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. An at 800/1900 MHz, for a total of &#x27;six&#x27; different frequencies (though at most four in a single mode). This allows the same handset to be sold for AT&amp;T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint in the U.S. as well as a broad range of GSM carriers worldwide such as Vodafone, Orange and T-Mobile (Excluding-US), many of whom offer official unlocking.

<doc id="1080835" wikidata="Q4392799" url="?curid=1080835" title="Elephant garlic">
<text>Elephant garlic (&quot;Allium ampeloprasum&quot; var. &quot;ampeloprasum&quot;) is a plant belonging to the onion genus and a cultivar of &quot;Allium ampeloprasum&quot;, the broadleaf wild leek. It has a tall, solid, flowering stalk, and flat leaves. The flavor is milder than garlic and can be eaten raw in salads, roasted, or sautéed, but is generally not a substitute for conventional garlic in cooking. It is sometimes confused with solo garlic.

==Cultivation and use==

The mature bulb is broken up into cloves that are large with papery skins, and these are used for both culinary purposes and propagation. Also, much smaller corms with a hard shell grow on the outside of the bulb. Many gardeners often ignore these, but if they are planted, they produce a nonflowering plant in their first year, which has a solid bulb, essentially a single large clove. In their second year, this single clove then, like a normal bulb, divides into many separate cloves. While it may take an extra year, it is desirable to plant these small bulbils (several can be produced by each bulb) and increase the harvest.

Unlike many garlics, elephant garlic does not have to be harvested or divided each year, but can be ignored and left in the ground without much risk of rotting. The plant, if left alone, will spread into a clump with many flowering heads (one stalk and flower from each clove, once the bulb divides). These are often left in flower gardens as an ornament and to discourage pests. Once they get overcrowded, the plant may not do as well, and growth is stunted, with some rotting. Elephant garlic is not generally propagated by seeds.

Like regular garlic, elephant garlic can be roasted whole on the grill or baked in the oven, then used as a spread with butter on toast. Fresh elephant garlic contains mostly moisture and foams up like boiling potatoes, whether on the stove or in a glass dish in the oven. Drying in the basement for a few months reduces the moisture content and brings out a fuller flavor.

==Properties==
When crushed and then analyzed using a DART ion source, elephant garlic has been shown to produce both allicin, found in garlic, and syn-propanethial-S-oxide (onion lachrymatory factor), found in onion and leek, but absent in garlic, consistent with the classification of elephant garlic as a closer relative of leek than of garlic.

==Cultivation==
Elephant garlic can be planted at two different times of the year: spring and autumn. In warmer areas, it can be grown over winter for a late-spring harvest.

<doc id="1080840" wikidata="Q1830491" url="?curid=1080840" title="Whiston, Merseyside">
<text>Whiston is a town and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley in Merseyside, England. Previously recorded within the historic county of Lancashire, it is located east of Liverpool. The population was 13,629 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 14,263 at the 2011 Census.

A new village, Halsnead Garden Village, was approved with government support in 2017 and will be located in the Halsnead area of the town. The new village will contain over 1,500 houses, a primary school, a country park, and various community and leisure facilities. Construction is estimated to cost around £270 million.

==History==
The first record of Whiston comes in 1245, being rendered as &quot;Quistan&quot; and being within the West Derby Hundred in Lancashire. Archeological evidence such as a neolithic polished hand-axe and mesolithic tool fragments suggest that the region was host to pre-historic settlement up to 12,000 years, ago while other archaeological finds include remnants of a Roman tile workshop in nearby Tarbock and a medieval shovel head.

The main industry of Whiston&#x27;s earlier documented history is agriculture, with the first recorded mill in the area being held by local lord Henry Travers from 1190. By 1521, the first documentation of coal mining is made, which would in time become Whiston&#x27;s primary industry. By 1700, the coalfields of Whiston, Prescot, and Sutton were producing 25,000-50,000 tonnes of coal annually, and this would only increase as the Industrial Revolution progressed and the Whiston area became host to tens of collieries over the 18th and 19th Centuries. By 1901, the population of Whiston was 3,430.

The Church of St. Nicholas on Windy Arbor Road was consecrated on 30 July 1868, replacing a chapel dating from 1846. It hosts a war memorial, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, which was struck by lightning in 1928. The memorial was replaced in 1932. The stone-built Methodist Church on the High Street dates from the 19th century.

Whiston had a sanatorium, an isolation hospital, and a workhouse, part of the Prescot Union workhouses.

Whiston was previously host to Halsnead Hall, a neoclassical manor that housed the Willis family, chief landholders in Whiston from 1684 until the auctioning of their estate in 1929. Halsnead Hall, demolished in 1932 and now the site of Halsnead static caravan park, was designed by the renowned architect Sir John Soane. Before its demolition, it was the sole example of Soane&#x27;s work in either Lancashire or Cheshire.

==Governance==
Prior to boundary changes in 2016, Whiston consisted of the Whiston North and Whiston South wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley. The North and South wards were separated by the Liverpool to Manchester Railway, which runs directly through the town. The former borough wards of North and South are still used in the form of Town Council wards, but for the purposes of Borough representation, Whiston elects three councillors via the combined ward of Whiston and Cronton.

Whiston lent its name to and was formerly the headquarters of the Whiston Rural District within the County of Lancashire before the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Whiston Town Council oversees parish level administration.

==Transport==
Whiston is crossed by the historic Liverpool to Manchester Railway, and is served by Whiston railway station with services to Liverpool and Manchester, operated by Northern. Local bus routes to Runcorn, Liverpool, St Helens and Huyton also serve the town. These are operated by, among other smaller local providers, Stagecoach and Arriva.

==Health==
St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust operates Whiston Hospital. The hospital supports the primary maternity department for the Knowsley and St Helens boroughs, alongside a regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit serving North West England, North Wales and the Isle of Man. The Trust is a member organisation of the teaching hospital system partnered with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Edge Hill University.

==Industries==
Local industry includes Glen Dimplex Home Appliances, producing kitchen appliances and employing approximately 1,000 people.

==Education==
===Primary education===
*St Luke&#x27;s Catholic Primary School
*Halsnead Primary School
*Whiston Willis Primary School
*St Leo&#x27;s &amp; Southmead Catholic Primary School

===Secondary education===
In 2010, two of Whiston&#x27;s secondary schools were closed and redeveloped under the Labour Party governments &#x27;Building Schools for the Future&#x27; scheme. This £150 million programme created seven new &#x27;Centres for Learning&#x27; to replace the ten existing secondary schools within the Knowsley borough.

*Knowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School, Cumber Lane.
Constructed in 1964, Knowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School was one of the first comprehensive schools in the local area, purpose built under the Labour Party&#x27;s education reforms to formally abolish the tripartite system of education; to amalgamate grammar, technical and secondary modern schools into one appropriately named Comprehensive System. 
In March 2010, after serving the local area for 46 years, Higher Side Comprehensive School was permanently closed and subsequently demolished to make way for the new St Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic Centre for Learning which was constructed on vacant land behind Higher Side&#x27;s main buildings. The land on which Higher Side once stood now serves as a car park and recreational area for staff and pupils of the new St Edmund Arrowsmith.

The only remaining building of the former Higher Side School site is the former Whiston &amp; Prescot City Learning Centre (CLC), now St Edmund Arrowsmith Science Hub. The building was originally constructed and opened in 2000. Pupils of the school who were still enrolled at Higher Side at the time its closure were transferred to its replacement Knowsley Park Centre for Learning (now The Prescot School) based on Knowsley Park Lane, Prescot.

*St Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic Academy, Whiston, Cumber Lane.
Closed, relocated and rebuilt behind the former Knowsley Higher Side Comprehensive School on Cumber Lane. Renamed as &#x27;St Edmund Arrowsmith Catholic Centre for Learning&#x27; for a while. The original St Edmund Arrowsmith Building on Scotchbarn Lane was retained for several years and redeveloped as a youth training academy, but has also since been demolished.

<text>Perspectives of New Music (PNM) is a peer-reviewed academic journal specializing in music theory and analysis. It was established in 1962 by Arthur Berger and Benjamin Boretz (who were its initial editors-in-chief).

&quot;Perspectives&quot; was first published by the Princeton University Press, initially supported by the Fromm Music Foundation. The first issue was favorably reviewed in the &quot;Journal of Music Theory&quot;, which observed that Berger and Boretz had produced &quot;a first issue which sustains such a high quality of interest and cogency among its articles that one suspects the long delay preceding the yet-unborn Spring 1963 issue may reflect a scarcity of material up to their standard&quot;. When Fromm discontinued his support, &quot;Perspectives of New Music&quot; formed an independent corporation, which has continued its publication.

Boretz edited the journal from 1962 through 1983, with co-editors Berger (1962–1964), Edward T. Cone (1968–1972), and Elaine Barkin (1972–1983). John Rahn was editor from 1983 until 1993, and Boretz again in 1994/95. From 1995 until 2000, there was a group of five editors: Joseph Dubiel, Marion Guck, Marianne Kielian-Gilbert, Andrew Mead, and Stephen Peles. Musicologist Jerome Kohl was the journal&#x27;s managing editor from 1985 to 1999. The current editors are Boretz, Robert Morris, and Rahn.

<text>Bidston is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in Merseyside, England.

Administratively, it is a ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Before local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, it was part of the County Borough of Birkenhead, within the geographical county of Cheshire. At the 2001 Census, the population of Bidston was 10,446, consisting of 4,725 males and 5,721 females. By the time of the 2011 Census the electoral ward was called Bidston and St. James (St James is part of Bidston and not a separate locality). This ward includes Beechwood to the south of Bidston and extends into much of Birkenhead to the east, including all of the south side of the Great Float. The total population of this ward at this Census was 15,216 of which 7,117 were males and 8,099 were female.

==History==
Bidston has been occupied since the Mesolithic era, evidenced by flints excavated during the 1990s. Neolithic and Roman artefacts have also been discovered in the vicinity of the village. The circular nature of the St Oswald&#x27;s Church grounds indicate an early origin to the site. Bidston Hill contains a number of ancient rock carvings, including that of a Sun Goddess, thought to have been carved by the Norse-Irish around 1000 AD.

The original parish of Bidston comprised Bidston, Moreton, Saughall Massie, Claughton and Birkenhead. Bidston Hall was originally held by the heirs of Hamon de Massey. The hall eventually passed to the Stanley family, after being purchased by John Stanley of Lathom on 24 June 1397.

The residential buildings in the village core date from between the 16th and 18th century. Typically, these are former farmhouses, farm buildings and cottages, constructed from local red sandstone. Many are Grade II listed buildings.

===Early modern===
The Liverpool to Holyhead semaphore telegraph was set up in 1826, on which Bidston had a signals station. This replaced a flag signalling station dating to 1763, and which itself was replaced in 1861 by an electrical telegraph. Along with the construction of Bidston Lighthouse in 1771, this facilitated shipping to the Port of Liverpool. Bidston Observatory was added in 1866, further enabling shipping movements on the River Mersey.

In the 19th century, Bidston underwent industrial expansion. The greatest effect was possibly the drainage of Bidston Moss, during the construction of Birkenhead Docks. By the end of the century, Bidston had also gained significant railway infrastructure with an engine shed and a railway junction where the Birkenhead to West Kirby, New Brighton and Wrexham lines met.

===20th century===
A goods marshalling yard was added to the railway infrastructure by the early 20th century. During World War I, Bidston had an army training camp. Bidston Aerodrome opened temporarily in 1920, on the site of what is now the golf course. Bidston Dock was opened in 1933, remaining in use until the 1990s. During World War II, a German prisoner-of-war camp was temporarily established. Although never used for its original purpose, Bidston Hill&#x27;s air-raid shelter was built from December 1941, having 2,213 bunks and 793 seats. The Gordon, a three-wheeled car, was produced in Bidston between 1954 and 1958.

The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory&#x27;s Joseph Proudman building was opened in Bidston in 1975, surviving until 2013.

==Geography==

Bidston is in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Leasowe, approximately east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and west of the River Mersey at Seacombe. The village of Bidston is situated on the north-western side of Bidston Hill, with the centre of the village at an elevation of approximately above sea level.

The Birket passes between Bidston Village and Bidston Moss, before discharging into West Float and then into the River Mersey.

==Government==
Bidston is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. The village is part of the parliamentary constituency of Birkenhead. The current Member of Parliament is Mick Whitley, a Labour representative. He has been the MP since 2019 and currently holds a majority of 17,705.

The area is also part of a local government ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, this being Bidston and St. James Ward. Bidston is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. These are Julie McManus, Ann McLachlan and Brian Kenny, who are all Labour councillors. Ann McLachlan is also the Deputy Leader of the council. The most recent local elections took place on 5 May 2016.



The electorate numbered 9,985, there was a turnout of 24.6% and the majority is 1,373.

==Economy==
===Retail===
The major employers in Bidston are a 24-hour Tesco superstore and B&amp;Q. The Tesco superstore and petrol station, built in the 1990s, occupy the site of the former Bidston steelworks and a disused railway marshalling yard. Meanwhile, B&amp;Q operates within the Bidston Moss Retail Park, a development built in the 1980s, which includes branches of Halfords, Home Bargains, Carpetright and Pets at Home. Marks &amp; Spencer and Aldi each opened stores at the retail park in 2016. Other businesses, which formerly occupied the retail park, included MFI.

===Industrial estate===
The Valley Road Industrial Estate includes the premises of Park Group PLC, a Christmas hamper and pre-paid gift card provider.

Bidston Moss also has one of the main waste and recycling centres for Wirral, which is operated by Veolia. Originally part of the same site, the former Bidston tip was in operation from the 1930s, closing around 1997, and then landscaped as part of the Bidston Moss Nature Reserve.

==Community==
===Schools===
Bidston Village Church of England Primary School is located in Ballantyne Drive, close to the centre of the village, and accommodates around 300 pupils. Holy Cross Catholic Primary School is located on Gautby Road. The Observatory School, located on Bidston Village Road, is a community special school serving pupils aged 11–16.

===Churches===
St Oswald&#x27;s Church is Bidston&#x27;s Church of England church, and dates back to the 13th century. The current building has a 16th-century tower, with the rest of the church rebuilt in the mid to late-19th century. Holy Cross Church, the last designed by F. X. Velarde and built in 1959, is a Grade II listed building located at the junction of Hoylake Road and Worcester Road. This church is Bidston&#x27;s local Catholic church but is now closed and boarded up. Bidston also has a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, located in School Lane.

===Leisure===
A play and community centre is situated on Gautby Road, and a model boating lake is opposite.

====Public houses====
The only operational public house, within the vicinity of the village, is &quot;The Bidston&quot; on Hoylake Road. Bidston has had a couple of public houses closer to the centre of the village. The &quot;Ring &#x27;o Bells Inn&quot; closed in 1868, and is now a residential property. &quot;The Corsair&quot; closed prior to 2009, and the site was approved for a residential construction in 2015.

====Parks, commons and other green spaces====

Bidston Hill comprises of heathland and woodland maintained by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council as a nature reserve and public park. The land was purchased in stages from 1894 to 1908 by Birkenhead Corporation from local landowner Lord Vyner. It is the site of Bidston Windmill, built around 1800 and Bidston Observatory, owned by the Natural Environment Research Council.

Adjacent to Bidston Hill is Tam O&#x27;Shanter Cottage, which is believed to have been built about 300 years ago. Its name derives from a stone carving of the poem &quot;Tam O&#x27;Shanter&quot; by Robert Burns, which adorns a wall on the site. In 1950, the building was recognised as having special historical interest for preservation. Despite two fires and threats of demolition in 1954 and 1975, the cottage was rebuilt and restored in the mid-1970s. Four acres around the cottage were developed as a city farm in 1986, known as the Tam O&#x27;Shanter Urban Farm.

Opposite the cottage is Flaybrick Memorial Gardens, Birkenhead&#x27;s first municipal cemetery. The grounds encompass an arboretum and nature trails.

Bidston Moss was originally low-lying wetland marsh at the head of Wallasey Pool. In 1936 most of the land was given over to residential, commercial and industrial landfill. Since the cessation of waste disposal operations in 1995, Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority and the charitable trust Groundwork Wirral have undertaken environmental restoration works to landscape the site. The former landfill sites are now part of a nature reserve, which has several sections surrounding Bidston Moss Retail Park and Junction 1 of the M53.

Bidston Village has won title of &quot;Best Small Village&quot; several times at the &quot;Northwest In Bloom&quot; awards.

===Sport===
Bidston Golf Club and 18-hole golf course, opened in 1913, is situated to the north of the village, on the opposite side of the M53 and railway station. The Wirral Tennis and Leisure Centre, operated by the local council and located on Valley Road, offers six indoor and two outdoor tennis courts, a sports hall, a fitness suite and five-a-side football pitches.

==Transport==
===Road===

The village is nearest to the northern end of the B5151 road. The retail park is situated on the A554 and also adjacent to Junction 1 of the M53 motorway. The A553 Bidston bypass separates the village from the railway station, and the retail park, to the north. This dual carriageway allows quicker road travel between Birkenhead and Moreton. The former route, through the centre of the village, is now cut off at the western end by the M53.

===Rail===
The locality is served by Bidston railway station. Trains operate to Liverpool and West Kirby on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network and to Wrexham on the Borderlands Line. Birkenhead North railway station is also a short distance away from the locality.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 56 passes through the centre of the village, along Bidston Village Road and School Lane. The route continues alongside the A554 and turns off before Bidston Moss Retail Park, travelling between the retail park and the nature reserve and then beneath the M53 motorway. This route goes from Chester to Liverpool via Leasowe and Seacombe and includes part of the Wirral Way, along its course.

<text>Bromborough ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England, on the Wirral Peninsula south-east of Bebington and north of Eastham. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Merseyside in 1974.

At the 2011 census, the population of the Bromborough ward was 14,850.

==History==
The name &quot;Brunanburh&quot; is suggested to mean &quot;Bruna&#x27;s fortification&quot;, with &quot;burh&quot; being Old English for a fortified place.

Bromborough is a contender for the site of an epic battle of 937, the Battle of Brunanburh, which confirmed England as a united Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The philological case for Bromborough as &quot;Brunanburh&quot; has been questioned, on the basis that the first element in the name may be &#x27;brown&#x27; and not &#x27;Bruna&#x27;. Bromborough would therefore be &#x27;the brown [stone-built] manor or fort&#x27;.

An Anglo-Saxon cross, reconstructed from fragments, is in the churchyard of local parish church St Barnabas. Bromborough is not specifically named in the Domesday Survey, and the name does not appear in records until the 12th century.

A market charter allowing a market to be held each Monday was granted by Edward I in 1278 to the monks of St. Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey. It was hoped that establishing the market in the vicinity of Bromborough Cross would promote honest dealing. The market cross was the traditional centre of the village and also an assembly point for local farm labourers available for hire. The steps of the cross are from the original 13th-century monument. The cross itself is a more recent reproduction, presented to the town by the Bromborough Society.

With a watermill having been recorded near Bromborough at the time of the Domesday Survey, Bromborough watermill was likely to have been the oldest mill site on the Wirral. Located on the River Dibbin at what is known as Spital Dam, it was worked until 1940 and demolished in 1949. The site is now a children&#x27;s nursery. A windmill, built in 1777, existed on higher ground also at the same location. Having fallen into disuse and much deteriorated, it was destroyed by gunpowder in about 1878.

An increase in traffic passing through the area resulted in Bromborough undergoing extensive redevelopment in the 1930s. Bromborough Hall, built in 1617, was demolished in 1932 to make way for a by-pass and a number of farmhouses and cottages in the area of Bromborough Cross were replaced with shops.

==Geography==
Bromborough is situated on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, on the western side of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-southeast of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-northeast of the Dee Estuary at Parkgate. Bromborough Cross is at an elevation of about above sea level.

==Landmarks==
The partially medieval Bromborough Cross, in the old village centre, is a designated Grade II* listed building.
St Barnabas&#x27; Church, designed by George Gilbert Scott, is also Grade II* listed and was constructed in the 1860s to replace a smaller church.
Both Stanhope House and Pear Tree Cottage are Grade II listed and are amongst several buildings from the late seventeenth century that survive in the modern town.

==Community==

To the west of the A41 New Chester Road, Bromborough is mainly residential development started in the 1930s, centred on the original village centre with its market cross.

There are a number of pubs in Bromborough: &#x27;The Bromborough,&#x27; the &#x27;Royal Oak&#x27; and the local British Legion, now known as the Bromborough Social Club are situated in Bromborough Village. &#x27;The Archers&#x27; pub had closed down by 2013 and planning permission was submitted for it to be demolished. On the outskirts, bordering Eastham, are the &#x27;Merebrook&#x27; and the &#x27;Dibbinsdale&#x27;, where there is a branch of the Pesto restaurant chain.

Bromborough&#x27;s green spaces include Brotherton Park and Dibbinsdale Local Nature Reserve, along the banks of the River Dibbin, and Marfords Park to the south west of the town.

The local newspapers are the &quot;Bromborough and Bebington News&quot; and the &quot;Wirral Globe&quot;.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Bromborough, at metropolitan borough level: Wirral Council. The council is a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region.

The Bromborough ward is generally defined by Stanley Road in New Ferry to the north, the Mersey to the east, the railway line to the west and Acre Lane to the south. Bromborough is represented on Wirral Council by three Green councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 4 May 2023.

Bromborough is within the parliamentary constituency of Ellesmere Port and Bromborough, represented by Labour MP Justin Madders.

===Administrative history===
Bromborough was an ancient parish in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into two townships, called Bromborough (which included the village itself) and Brimstage, which was detached from the main part of the parish, lying a couple of miles to the west. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Bromborough, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so each township became a separate civil parish.

In 1873, Bromborough was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Bromborough Urban District was abolished in 1922, merging with the neighbouring urban districts of Higher Bebington and Lower Bebington to form the Bebington and Bromborough Urban District. In 1921, the last census before its abolition, the parish and urban district of Bromborough had a population of 2,652.

Bebington and Bromborough Urban District was renamed Bebington in 1933, when its territory was also significantly enlarged to take in Storeton, Poulton cum Spital, Brimstage, Thornton Hough, Raby, and Eastham. The urban district was raised to the status of a municipal borough in 1937. Bromborough remained part of the borough of Bebington until its abolition in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area then became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the new county of Merseyside.

==Economy==
East of the A41 road, towards the River Mersey, is industrial development and includes Bromborough Pool, an early industrial &quot;model village&quot; developed from 1853–58 by Price&#x27;s Candles. Part of the industry is connected to the former Bromborough Dock and includes a ammonium nitrate warehouse and the main landfill site for the Wirral, now a walkway with views of the river. Cereal Partners employs 340 people and produces Cheerios and Corn Flakes, among other breakfast cereals, in a factory formerly owned by Viota. Rank Hovis McDougall briefly owned the business in the 1990s. Another major business is Sun Valley Snacks Ltd, which processes peanuts.

The Croft Retail &amp; Leisure Park, which opened in March 1990, is located off the A41.

==Transport==
===Road===
The main road through the area is the A41 New Chester Road. The B5137 Spital Road joins the A41 at Bromborough. Junctions 4 and 5 of the M53 motorway are equidistant from Bromborough, each about away; Junction 4 is to the west and Junction 5 is to the south.

===Bus===
There are many local bus services which serve the village, mostly operated by Stagecoach Merseyside. Stagecoach Gold service 1 offers direct, premium connections to Liverpool and Birkenhead to the north; Chester, Chester Zoo and Ellesmere Port to the south.

===Rail===
Bromborough and Bromborough Rake railway stations are both situated on the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network. Trains run every 15 minutes to , every 30 minutes to , and there are six trains per hour to .

<text>West Kirby () is a coastal town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. In the north west of the Wirral Peninsula and at the mouth of the River Dee, the town is contiguous with Hoylake. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, and became part of Merseyside in 1974. The built up area had a population of 13,380 at the 2021 census.

== History ==
The name West Kirby is of Viking origin, originally &quot;Kirkjubyr&quot;, meaning &#x27;village with a church&#x27;. The form with the modifier &quot;West&quot; exists to distinguish it from the other town of the same name in Wirral: Kirkby-in-Walea (now the modern town of Wallasey). The earliest usage given of this form is &quot;West Kyrkeby in Wirhale&quot; in 1285.
The old village lay around St. Bridget&#x27;s Church, but the town today is centred on West Kirby railway station, which is about 1 km away. The town has a Victorian promenade, flanked by the West Kirby Marine Lake that permits boats to sail even at low tide. The original wall was built to create the lake in 1899 but suffered a catastrophic leak in 1985. A new lake was constructed on the site which is wider than previously and allows better sporting opportunities. The Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial is a notable local landmark, designed in 1922 by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger, who was responsible for a number of war memorials around the world, including the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering West Kirby, at metropolitan borough level: Wirral Council. The council is a member of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of the Liverpool City Region.

===Administrative history===
West Kirby was an ancient parish in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. It was subdivided into nine townships: Caldy, Frankby, Grange, Greasby, Hoose, Great Meols, Little Meols, Newton cum Larton, and a West Kirby township covering the area around the village itself.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including West Kirby, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so each of the townships also became a civil parish.

The population of the West Kirby township was 148 in 1801, 435 in 1851, and 2,441 in 1891.

A local government district was created in 1891, covering Great Meols, Hoose, Little Meols, West Kirby and part of Grange. There was a dispute about whether the district&#x27;s name should be &#x27;Hoylake and West Kirby&#x27; or &#x27;West Kirby and Hoylake&#x27;; the county council chose the latter.

Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894, at which point the civil parishes within the district were united into a single civil parish called Hoylake-cum-West Kirby. Although the order creating the district in 1891 had put the name West Kirby first, the council took to calling the district Hoylake and West Kirby. To resolve the ambiguity, the government formally confirmed the district&#x27;s name as being Hoylake and West Kirby in 1897. The council chose to base itself in Hoylake, building Hoylake Town Hall there in 1898.

The urban district was enlarged in 1933 to take in the civil parishes of Caldy, Frankby, Grange, and Greasby. The urban district then covered a very similar area to the ancient parish of West Kirby, but from its expansion the urban district was just called Hoylake. Hoylake Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the new county of Merseyside.

== Geography ==
West Kirby lies at the north-western corner of the Wirral Peninsula. West Kirby is on the eastern side of the mouth of the Dee Estuary, opposite North Wales and approximately west of Liverpool. Hilbre Island is approximately offshore from West Kirby, at the mouth of the Dee Estuary.

== Community ==
=== Schools ===
Secondary schools in the area are Calday Grange Grammar School on Caldy Hill, West Kirby Grammar School and Hilbre High School, which includes the WestWirralWorks City Learning Centre and West Kirby Residential School.

=== Churches ===

St Bridget&#x27;s Church is West Kirby&#x27;s Church of England parish church, and the chancel of the present church dates from around 1320. St Andrew&#x27;s Church is West Kirby&#x27;s second Church of England church, originally built as a chapel of ease for St Bridget&#x27;s, gaining its own parish in 1920.

St Agnes&#x27; Church is the local Roman Catholic church. West Kirby also has a United Reformed church, which dates to 1890, and a Methodist church dating from 1904.

=== Leisure ===
West Kirby Library is within West Kirby Concourse, and operated by the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. The West Kirby Museum, founded in 1892, is adjacent to St Bridget&#x27;s Church.

==== Parks, gardens and beach ====

The town itself contains Ashton Park and a starting point of the Wirral Way, which follows the trackbed of the former Birkenhead Railway branch line from Hooton. Sandlea Park lies in the centre of the town, a short walk from the railway station. Coronation Gardens is located between the southern end of the promenade between South Parade and Banks Road. There are various other small parks and bowling greens around the town. Another popular activity is to walk out to the islands of Little Eye, Middle Eye and Hilbre Island at low tide. The promenade, beach and the walk to the war memorial allow an excellent panoramic view of part of the North Wales coastline.

=== Sport ===

Sailboarding, sailing and kayaking are all popular local sports. In October 1991 the World Windsurfing Production Speed Record was set by Dave White on the West Kirby Marine Lake at 42.16 knots.

Water sports fans are warned to wear appropriate footwear while using the marine lake because of the presence of weaver fish with sharp poisonous barbs. There is also an RNLI Lifeboat Station near West Kirby Sailing Club.

The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, a links course between West Kirby and Hoylake, has hosted 11 British Open Golf championships in the past 121 years, most recently the 2006 and 2014 British Opens.

Tennis tournaments have been held in Ashton Park. Here, players including John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Monica Seles and Pete Sampras have played in competition.

West Kirby FC is the town&#x27;s senior football club, which plays in the West Cheshire League and plays its matches at Marine Park, Greenbank Road. West Kirby Ladies FC was officially established in 2017 and also play their matches at Marine Park, as do West Kirby Ladies U18s who play in the Cheshire Women&#x27;s and Youth League. The town has one of the largest junior football clubs in the North West, with over 90 teams and 1,000 players at West Kirby United. The teams play at many venues across West Kirby, including Calday Grange Grammar School, Hilbre High School and Greenbank Road. There were initially two junior clubs in the town, West Kirby Panthers and West Kirby Wasps, until the two sections merged to create West Kirby United in July 2017. The junior clubs play in the Eastham League with a youth section who play as West Kirby United in the North West under-21 League.

West Kirby is also home to Hoylake Amateur Swimming Club who train at West Kirby Concourse.

==== Marine Lake ====
The Marine Lake is a large man-made coastal lake. The structure is large enough to hold sailing events, such as the Wilson Trophy, sailboarding and water-related activities including canoeing, kayaking and power-boating. In 2009, it was reported that the lake had undergone structural damage, most likely due to estuarine erosion. Since this report a £750K refurbishment has taken place to help restore the lake, and it is now back to holding water-sport activities.

== Media ==

<text>Pensby () is a large village on the Wirral Peninsula, in Merseyside, England. It is located to the north of the town of Heswall and approximately to the south west of Thingwall. Historically within Cheshire, the area is part of the Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and is in the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West.

At the 2001 census the village of Pensby had 6,900 inhabitants. The 2011 census measured the population of the Pensby and Thingwall ward at 13,007.

==History==
The name Pensby comes from Old Norse, meaning a village or settlement at a hill called &quot;Penn&quot;.
The &quot;by&quot; suffix, included in neighbouring place names such as Frankby, Greasby, and Irby, is Viking in origin. 
Over time, the name has been spelt variously as &quot;Penisby&quot; (c.1229), &quot;Penlisby&quot; (1307) and &quot;Pemmesby&quot; (1523).

Lower Pensby was previously known as Newtown. This was due to the building of new houses around the turn of the twentieth century at the crossroads of Pensby Road and Gills Lane.

The population of the village over time was recorded at 22 in 1801, 48 in 1901 and increasing significantly to 2,996 by 1951.

==Geography==
==Governance==
Pensby was formerly a township in the parish of Woodchurch, in the Wirral Hundred. It became a civil parish in 1866. Historically within the county of Cheshire, it was part of the Wirral Rural District from 1894 and Wirral Urban District from 1933. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. Further changes occurred on 1 April 1974, when local government reorganisation resulted in most of Wirral, including Pensby, transfer from Cheshire to the newly formed metropolitan county of Merseyside.

Pensby is represented nationally through the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. As of , the current Member of Parliament is Matthew Patrick, a Labour representative. At local government level, it is part of a Pensby and Thingwall Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. It is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three Labour councillors.

The Pensby Hotel was the single pub in the village, but after a £500,000 cannabis bust by police, was boarded up and left empty after October 2013. There was a campaign for the building to be listed as a community asset, meaning that the community would have been given six months to prepare a bid for it, which may or may not have been accepted by the owner, but community asset status was rejected by Wirral Council in September 2015. Planning permission was subsequently granted for the demolition of the building and construction of the new care home, and demolition began in October 2016.

<doc id="1080857" wikidata="Q3875229" url="?curid=1080857" title="New Ferry">
<text>New Ferry is an urban area on the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. It is located on the Wirral Peninsula, with the River Mersey to the east and the town of Bebington to the west. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Cheshire, the area was developed from the early nineteenth century.

The 2001 census measured the population at 5,300.

==History==
As with the neighbouring settlement of Rock Ferry to the north-west, a ferry service gave its name to the locality: the first recorded mention of New Ferry was in 1774. On 4 April 1865, a &quot;South End&quot; service was established between New Ferry and South Ferry Basin in the southern dock system of Liverpool, although this appears to have been relatively short-lived. From 1879, services to Liverpool Pier Head were usually augmented with Rock Ferry. The ferry service was forced to close after a ship collided with New Ferry Pier in thick fog, in the early hours of 30 January 1922. Declining passenger numbers, improved local land-based public transport and a close proximity to the Rock Ferry service meant that it never reopened. The lease on the ferry rights officially expired on 22 September 1927, although no service had operated at New Ferry for over five years as a result of the collision.

New Ferry was part of the Lower Bebington township, which became the Bebington-cum-Bromborough civil parish in 1922. Between 1894 and 1974 these parishes were administered as part of Bebington urban district. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including New Ferry, being transferred from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside.

On 25 March 2017, a massive gas explosion destroyed and damaged a lot of buildings, causing many injuries. It was caused by a shop owner attempting to destroy his business so he could collect insurance money.

==Geography==
New Ferry is on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, on the western bank of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Heswall. The area lies at an elevation of between above sea level.

==Transport==
New Ferry is on the A41, the main road between Birkenhead and London before the introduction of motorways, and immediately adjacent to the village of Port Sunlight. At the centre of the town is the Toll Bar area, a name originating from when New Chester Road used to be a toll road. The re-routing of the A41 road onto the New Ferry By-pass, the first part from Bolton Road to Thorburn Road built in 1960, and extended from Thorburn Road to the Tranmere roundabout in 1976, has resulted in a decline in through-traffic in the town centre.

The nearest railway stations to New Ferry are Bebington and Port Sunlight, where trains operate to , and on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network.

New Ferry is served by several bus services: Arriva, Stagecoach and Merseylink all operate through the town en route to destinations such as Chester and Liverpool.

==Governance==
New Ferry is within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral South.

At local government level, the town is incorporated into the Bromborough Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors.

==Community==
The community-led New Ferry Residents Association (NeFRA) has been actively seeking funding for a variety of projects since its inception in 1999. As well as successfully campaigning to get CCTV cameras around the shopping centre; the main car parks resurfaced; environmental improvements within Winstanley Road and Salisbury Drive; new pavings, railings and lighting in New Chester Road; and starting up the successful Wirral Farmers&#x27; Market in the Village Hall, the group has more recently carried out improvements to the Shorefields Nature Park where further improvements are also imminent. The group was also very active in discussions with waste operator Biffa and the Forestry Commission regarding turning the nearby former tip site at Bromborough Dock into a new park, the Port Sunlight River Park, which opened in 2014.

===Shopping===
New Ferry has a small shopping precinct often referred to as &quot;The Ferry&quot;. The area used to have a few chain stores as well as many independent shops. Kwik Save had two small premises in the town before moving to one new purpose-built site in 1992, which was then taken over by the Somerfield supermarket chain in 1998. The Kwik Save name was retained until 2006 before rebranding as Somerfield. After the Co-operative Group acquired the Somerfield chain in 2009, the New Ferry store was rebranded again. This supermarket finally closed in May 2016.

Numerous smaller retailers include: the Discount Carpet Centre, a 20-year-old family business; Buckleys newsagents, which has been in business under the same owner since the early 1980s. The Buckley family have also been prominent in New Ferry since the early 1800s, when they used to own and run most of the buildings dotted around. Buckleys newsagents was taken over in 2013, and is now a convenience store with an off-licence. For a small shopping centre it is unusual in having four butcher&#x27;s shops: reputedly the oldest on Wirral is Edge&#x27;s, with the same family trading in New Ferry since it opened in the 1850s and a recipient of the &#x27;Best Local Retailer&#x27; in BBC&#x27;s national Food and Farming Awards in 2014. The other butchers include G H Pearson&#x27;s Pork Butchers in New Ferry Road and D E Griffiths (Butchers) Ltd in Bebington Road. The latter was severely damaged in the explosion of 2017 leading to closure.

The Wirral Farmers&#x27; Market, held in New Ferry&#x27;s Village Hall (between Longfellow Drive &amp; Grove Street) on the second Saturday of the month, received a UK National Regeneration Award from the British Urban Regeneration Association in 2005 for its work investing in the local community. It was also awarded the title of Britain&#x27;s Best Farmers&#x27; Market in 2007 from the national BBC Food &amp; Farming Awards. The market is run entirely by volunteers, its profits being used to fund local community groups and good causes.

New Ferry also had three major banks. These were National Westminster Bank, more commonly known as NatWest, which closed in 1993 and HSBC, formerly Midland Bank, which closed in the late 2000s. The third bank was the Trustee Savings Bank (TSB), which, due to a merger with Lloyds Bank in 1995, became Lloyds TSB and later due to new banking regulations demerged and the branch was rebranded as Lloyds Bank. The New Ferry branch closed in late July 2016. 

===2017 explosion===
At 9:15 pm on 25 March 2017, there was a huge explosion, destroying the large modern building at the junction of the shopping precinct with Boundary Road. Eighty one people were injured on the night, two of them seriously. The building that was destroyed housed a furniture shop, dance studio, charity shop and funeral service but had previously been used by the employment services. Over 200 surrounding buildings, both commercial and residential, were also significantly damaged and residents had to move to temporary accommodation. Businesses directly affected by the blast included DE Griffiths butchers, Ming Yuan beauty parlour, PK McMullen opticians, Lan&#x27;s House Chinese restaurant, Amelia Jane (florist), the Cleveland Arms and several vacant shop units. The cause of the explosion was investigated by the police, Health and Safety Executive, National Grid and Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service. In 2019 Pascal Blasio, a business man who leased the furniture shop in the destroyed building, was convicted of causing an explosion to endanger life and dishonestly making a false representation. He was sentenced to 20 years and eight years in jail, to run concurrently.

After the incident, the Conservative government refused to provide any funding as a result of the explosion, causing anger amongst the local community.

In September 2017, demolition of some of the most badly damaged buildings began. In addition a public consultation promoted by Wirral Council on redevelopment of New Ferry began. In 2020, a regeneration plan was decided by Wirral Council. It was for up to 1000 square metres of retail space and 79 houses or flats. The plan is for the explosion site, an area opposite it where damaged shops and houses had been demolished and also an adjacent large car-park flanked by derelict buildings.

In April 2020, Wirral Council applied for funding to regenerate New Ferry from the government&#x27;s Future High Streets fund. In December 2020 it was announced that New Ferry was provisionally awarded £3.2 million from the government&#x27;s fund, aimed at recovery from effects of the Covid19 pandemic and regenerate underused town centres.

===Public houses and clubs===
The area is home to several pubs including Shillings Bar, The Cleveland Arms and the Wirral Hotel.

The John Masefield is named in honour of a former poet laureate, who was briefly stationed on a training ship on the Mersey near New Ferry. Part of the JD Wetherspoon chain, the company received complaints due to the unfortunate resemblance of the Masefield portrait on the pub sign to Adolf Hitler. As a result, it has received the nickname of &quot;The Bünker&quot; or &quot;Adolf&#x27;s&quot;. The company had said it would consider renaming the pub, but this has not happened to date.

New Ferry also has a number of private members&#x27; clubs: The Ex Civil Defence Club in School Lane and The Bebington Liberal Club on Bebington Road. The latter building was sold and redeveloped in 2020 as a business centre to provide co-working space and offices. In addition there was a club of the Royal British Legion at Hesketh Hall on Boundary Road until 2010, when it closed and the building was converted into 14 one- and two-bedroom apartments in 2014.

One of New Ferry&#x27;s links with its historic past as a tourist resort between the 1860s and 1920s was the Great Eastern Pub. The building dated from 1862 when Liverpool day-trippers began crossing the River Mersey by ferry to New Ferry Pier when it became known as &quot;The Great Eastern Picnic Hotel&quot;. By coincidence, in 1888, Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s famous ship the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was broken up on the nearby shoreline, and many artefacts from the ship were auctioned off as it was being dismantled. The pub&#x27;s owner bought a number of these including the ship&#x27;s bar to install into the building, wood panelling for the walls, the ship&#x27;s wheel and a stained glass window. These were all removed by the last owners of the building in the mid-2000s, and the pub closed down in 2007. In November 2009 the site was sold to a housing developer, Worksharp Ecohomes Ltd of Southport, who, in February 2010, submitted a planning application to Wirral Borough Council to demolish the building, described as being &quot;in a state of serious disrepair&quot; and replace it with ten two-storey semi-detached houses. On 5 March 2010, the security screens were ripped off the doors and windows, the contents of the pub removed and the building left unsecured. Many members of the community had been concerned that the motive behind this was to accelerate the pub&#x27;s derelict state and ensure its future demolition. This process began in June 2010, ahead of a site meeting by Wirral Council&#x27;s planning committee and despite an online petition by New Ferry Residents Association to save the building. More than 400 people had signed the petition demanding that it be saved from the bulldozer and instead converted to housing. Worksharp EcoHomes obtained planning permission to replace the building with ten semi-detached homes, but conditions attached to the permission required them to provide a permanent memorial explaining the significance of the area and its connection with the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Work finally began on building the replacement houses in March 2013.

==Education==

Primary schools in the New Ferry area include Grove Street Primary School, Church Drive School, Port Sunlight and St Johns RC Primary. Secondary schools in the New Ferry area also include Co-op Academy Bebington, St John Plessington Catholic College, The former site of New Ferry market has been turned into a Learning Centre, offering opportunities for young people and adults to further their qualifications.

==Parks and open spaces==

Facilities at New Ferry Park include a play area for children (refurbished and extended in January 2010) and football pitches, which are often used during local amateur Sunday league matches. In early 2012, the football clubs obtained £60,000 to refurbish the changing pavilion in the centre of the park.

Shorefields Nature Park on the banks of the River Mersey is a winter bird haven designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

===New Ferry Butterfly Park===
Out of a thin piece of land adjoining Bebington railway station and along the railway towards Birkenhead, local volunteers have, since 1993, created a wildlife haven, New Ferry Butterfly Park. Occupying an area of almost 5 hectares, the Park is designated as an Area of Special Biological Interest. Open to visitors on Summer Sundays, local volunteers provide tours and help to manage the site throughout the year.

In December 2009, it was announced that the site&#x27;s owners, Brock plc, wished to sell the land - it is believed for development, even though the site is zoned as open space by the local authority. Brock have refused to sell the site to Cheshire Wildlife Trust or to Wirral Borough Council. As a result of the 3,600 named petition by local residents and concerned persons across Europe, in January 2010 the Council agreed to issue a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) on Brock to force them to sell the land to them so that this much loved ecological resource can be saved for future generations.

During 2010, artist-in-residence Carol Ramsay created an art trail within the Butterfly Park. The trail now contains work by many more artists. In 2012 an Empty Shop Project funded by Wirral Council allowed the Butterfly Park to move into the town centre for six months, with 6 artist residencies each encouraging community engagement. The shop was formally opened by Harriet Harman MP. The legacy of this project is that 2 more sculptures were added to the art trail, an interactive information board/artwork is in situ and a book has been published about it all. New Ferry Butterfly Park was awarded official Green Flag status for 2013/14. On Sunday 4 May 2014 the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, Dame Lorna Muirhead, officially raised the flag and opened the park for the summer season.

===Port Sunlight River Park===

On the shore of the Rivery Mersey, between New Ferry and Bromborough, the former landfill site at Bromborough Dock was turned into a new £2.3 million community park. Now known as Port Sunlight River Park, it opened in summer 2014. The park now provides visitors with a number of distinct experiences including a freshwater lake which is rich in wildlife and other new habitats, a scenic waterfront, a perimeter walk, a link to Shorefields Nature Park, and paths to the summit with views of the River Mersey estuary and Liverpool skyline.

==Sport==
New Ferry Rangers Football Club are a local amateur football club, who play their home matches at New Ferry Park on Sunday mornings.

The Olympic Taekwondo Centre is based at Bebington Youth Club, Cornwell Close. In 2008 the coach won Wirral Sports Council &#x27;Coach of the Year&#x27; and the club took the Junior -73 kg male British National Champion title for the second year running.

New Ferry is the home of Bebington Youth Centre. In late 2012, Wirral Borough Council proposed to close the youth club (amongst many across the borough as the result of significant budgetary problems). However, the proposals were heavily opposed by the community who came together and signed a petition with over 1700 signatures to save the centre. As a result, and the fact that the centre is one of the best attended in the borough, the Council dropped proposals for its closure in early 2013.
