<text>Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja () (3 January 1753 – 30 November 1805), also known as Cotiote Rajah and Pychy Rajah, was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Kottayam Kingdom in the Malabar region of Kerala between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with the British East India Company is known as the Cotiote War. Pazhassi&#x27;s rebellion against the British is often touted as one of the earliest acts of freedom fight in India. He earned the epithet &quot;Kerala Simham&quot; (&quot;Lion of Kerala&quot;) on account of his martial exploits.

Pazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When Hyder Ali of the Kingdom of Mysore occupied Malabar in 1773, the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in Kallara near Vaikom in Kottayam district of Kerala. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the &quot;de facto&quot; heads of state, surpassing several older royal contenders. He fought a war of resistance against the Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and due to his effective resistance to Mysoreans, he gained firm support of his subjects.

In 1792, after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, the East India Company imposed control in Kottayam in violation of an earlier agreement of 1790 which had recognised its independence. Vira Varma, to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue targets fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered an exorbitant tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met in 1793 by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja, who had always been opposed to the company&#x27;s rule. In 1796, the company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after a five-year-long war of insurgency, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gunfight at Mavila Thodu (small body of water), in the present-day Kerala-Karnataka border.

==Kingdom==
Pazhassi Raja was born as a Kshatriya Varma in the Royal Padinjare Kovilakam (Western Branch) of Purannattukara Swarupam, the royal lineage of Kottayam. This branch was located at Pazhassi which lay south west of Mattannur. Kerala Varma got the name Pazhassi Raja as he was a native of Pazhassi. The early British East India Company documents wrote &quot;Pazhassi Raja&quot; as &quot;Pychy Rajah&quot;, while the name &quot;Cotiote Raja&quot; comes from the anglicizing of &quot;Kottayam&quot; to &quot;Cotiote&quot;. Kottayam covers what is today the Thalassery taluk of the Kannur District and Wayanad district, along with the Gudalur taluk(Mudhumalai, Nellakotta, Srimadurai,Cherambadi, and Masinagudi) of Nilgiris district.

As a royal clan, Purannattukara Swarupam had three branches: a western branch (Padinjare Kovilakam) at Pazhassi, near Mattannur, an eastern branch (Kizhakke Kovilakam) at Manatana, near Peravoor, and a southern branch (Tekke Kovilakam) at Kottayampoil, near Koothuparamba.

==Resistance to Mysore occupation (1773–1793)==

Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s warfare with Mysore troops can be divided into two phases based on the rulers of the kingdom of Mysore. First phase lasted from 1773 to 1782 during which time, the Mysore ruler was Hyder Ali. The second phase extended from 1784 to 1793 and during this phase he fought the troops of Tipu Sultan, son and successor of Hyder Ali.

===Resistance to Hyder Ali (1773–1782)===
In 1773, Hyder Ali marched into Malabar for the second time, for non-payment of tributes from the Rajas (kings) of Malabar as agreed after the war in 1768. Most of the &quot;Rajas&quot; of Malabar, along with many &quot;Naduvazhis&quot; or vassals fled to Travancore. Yet numerous princes and younger noblemen refused to flee and organized partisan bands who waged guerrilla warfare on the Mysore army from the forests and mountains that covered much of Malabar. Pazhassi Raja was one among them.

In 1774, at the age of 21, Pazhassi Raja took over the throne to replace his uncle who had fled to Travancore. He vowed to resist Hyder Ali&#x27;s troops, and stayed in Kottayam, where he gathered a force and began guerrilla battles against the troops of Mysore as he had neither guns nor troops enough to face them in an open battle. He set up a large number of bases in the nearly impenetrable forested mountains of Puralimala and Wynad and repeatedly inflicted severe minor losses on the Mysore army in Kottayam as well as in Wayanad. Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s troops were recruited from several castes and tribes- that includes Nair forces Nambiars, Thiyyas, Kurichiyas and Mullukurumas

Once the true Raja of Kottayam had fled, three royals rose to power in Kottayam. The nephew of the escaped Raja named Vira Varma and his nephews, Ravi Varma and Pazhassi Raja now took over the reins of government. Vira Varma was skilled in political intrigue and manipulation whereas Ravi Varma was too incompetent to play any serious political role and hence his role only was nominal. Pazhassi Raja become the most powerful figure in Kottayam, much to the chagrin of his uncle Vira Varma. Hence Vira Varma played a series of power games aiming to check the growing clout of his nephew. So the relation between Vira Varma and Pazhassi Raja was one of enmity right from the onset.

The military situation was grim for &quot;Pazhassi Raja&quot; and his troops – in 1774, Coorgs had joined hands with Hyder Ali on the promise of being gifted Wynad and a large Coorg army camped in Wynad to help Mysore troops. In 1776, Hyder Ali re-installed the Hindu Raja in Chirakkal and the latter joined Mysore war effort to crush Pazhassi Raja. This triple alliance which lasted till 1780 reached nowhere near defeating the Kottayam army.

During his long war with the Mysore and then the East India Company, Pazhassi Raja increased his sphere of influence significantly eastwards as far as the outskirts of Mysore. His men regularly looted enemy treasuries and sandalwood from southern Karnataka and his enemies could do little to check these raids. This enabled him to lay claim on a great chunk of the Mysore district – as far as Nanjangod in the east. Also, Pazhassi Raja and his men frequently raided the domains of neighbouring Rajas in northern Malabar and Coorg to harass the enemy regiments posted there and he was often supported by local population of those territories. Along with this, he had close ties with Ravi Varma and Krishna Varma, who were princes of Calicut and popular rebel leaders of southern Malabar.

====Siege of Thalasseri====
Thalasseri or Tellicherry in the late 18th century was a harbour-fort which was held by the East India Company as a factory. The value of Tellicherry as a naval base meant that her capture could seriously impact the situation of the Bombay Marine on the west coast. Also rebels in North Malabar bought arms and ammunition from the East India Company in Tellicherry. So if Hyder could capture this fort, he could, at a stroke, cripple both the rebels in North Malabar as well as Company rule in India at a regional basis.

So in 1778, Hyder&#x27;s vassal, the Raja of Chirakkal, besieged Thalasseri and enforced an economic blockade under order from Hyder himself. The East India Company factories at Talassery armed Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s men to enable them to recover Kottayam from the Mysorean occupation army. This move by the Company ensured that the Chirakkal army was now at risk of being struck in the rear by Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s force. The Chirakkal troops began to retreat, but Pazhassi chased and devastated the Chirakkal army, and then marched to Kottayam where he obliterated the Mysorean occupation and overran all of western Kottayam. But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could have been destroyed by a joint action on the part of the Company and the Rajas, while their factories at Talassery were instructed by the Governor not to upset the nominal peace with Hyder.

Thus the EIC decision not to exploit the victory at Thalasseri was exploited by Mysore. The Chirakkal army reinforced by a Mysorean contingent under Balwant Rao marched into Kottayam. Pazhassi&#x27;s men, though secretly supplied with arms and ammunition by the company, could not hold or defeat this huge host and soon the Kottayam army was forced to disperse after a fight. Then the Mysore-Chirakkal army captured Kadathanad and installed a puppet Raja who joined hands with Mysore. In 1779, a huge Mysore-Chirakkal-Kadathanad army besieged Thalasseri. Pazhassi Raja sent a force of 2000 Nairs to aid the EIC defence of Thalassery, and this enabled the factories to hold on successfully.

By the end of 1779, Sardar Khan, the Mysorean general was sent to Thalasseri to bring the siege speedily to a successful conclusion. Sardar Khan came with a force of 10,000 troops and 30 heavy guns. Sardar Khan knew that it was Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s help that enabled the East India Company to resist him and so he opened negotiations with Pazhassi – his offer was the restoration of Mysore occupied territories of Kottayam if Pazhassi would ally himself with Mysore and pay an immediate tribute of 500,000 rupees. It was well beyond the capacity of Kottayam to raise so huge a sum in so short a time. But Pazhassi did his best to pay Sardar Khan [probably in the hope that the latter would make concessions] and 60,000 rupees was paid to the latter. But Khan was not satisfied and rejected Pazhassi&#x27;s request that his possessions in Malabar be restored. This greedy and tactless approach of Sardar Khan&#x27;s made sure that there was little chance for Mysore to capture Thalasseri. The Kottayam army became far stronger with their major victory in 1779 at Kalpetta (Wynad) where the whole Coorg army of 2,000 was surrounded and decimated by Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s troops. The destruction of the Coorg army in Wynad enabled Raja to throw a whole new army into the contest at Thalasseri.

In 1780, Pazhassi Raja proposed a plan to the East India Company to break the Mysorean siege of Thalassery: he and his men would strike the enemy in the rear from the east as the EIC came out of the fort and struck the Mysorean line in front. Both armies would effect a junction that would split the enemy into two. The Mysorean and allied troops could then be routed easily. But it was only in 1781 that the Company understood the value of this plan and their Bombay authorities agreed to it. An operation was carried out as per Pazhassi&#x27;s plan; it ended with the destruction of the Mysorean forces. What followed was a rebellion in Kottayam by the Nayar militia led by Pazhassi Raja. Soon, the Mysoreans were ousted.
===Rebellion to remove Tipu Sultan (1784–1793)===
By 1782, Kottayam was once more a free land. But by the Treaty of Mangalore (1784) after the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the Company administration recognised Tipu Sultan&#x27;s sphere of authority in Malabar. Thus with its only valuable ally lost, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore. Once more, as Sardar Khan did in 1779, Mysore exacted an exorbitant rate of tribute. Although Ravi Varma, the elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay 65,000 rupees per year, Mysore demanded 81,000 rupees. The hiked rate of tribute meant greater hardship for the peasantry (largely Thiyyar) who had suffered from years of foreign occupation. So Pazhassi Raja took up this issue and decided to launch a mass resistance struggle once more.

What angered Pazhassi Raja even more was that his brother Ravi Varma who paid a visit to Tipu Sultan in 1786 for peace talks was forced to sign a treaty which ceded Wayanad to Tipu Sultan. Pazhassi Raja decided not to let Tipu enjoy Wayanad in peace and kept up a guerrilla warfare that constantly harassed Mysore troops in Wayanad and its neighbourhood. War in Wayanad lasted for seven years – till 1793 – when the last of the Mysorean garrisons were expelled from the soil of Wayanad.

By the end of 1788, Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s hatred of Tipu had shot up on account of the latter&#x27;s policy of forcible conversion. So he strengthened his ties with the East India Company on one hand and with fellow rebel chiefs and princes in Malabar on the other. Tipu sent an army under a French general named Lally with a genocidal mission—the extermination of the Nair caste from Kottayam to Palakkad – as Tipu was determined to end the menace of Nair rebels in Malabar who had foiled all attempts of him and his late father Hyder Ali to subjugate and exploit Malabar.

The senior Rajah of Kottayam fled to Travancore fearing the Sultan. But before that, he handed over charge of government to Pazhassi Raja and asked him to save the country from Mysore&#x27;s onslaught. Given below is the observation made by historian Rajayyan about Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s resistance to Tipu Sultan after the exodus of Rajas from Malabar in 1788:

But in 1790, Tipu abandoned the war in Malabar as the war in Deccan drew his attention. Pazhassi Raja joined the East India Company with a force of 1500 Nairs to capture the Mysorean stronghold in Katirur (near Talassery). After Katirur, Pazhassi Raja and his troops moved south-east and captured the Kuttiyadi fort from Tipu&#x27;s men. Thus once more, the whole of Kottayam was under the control of Pazhassi Raja. In 1790, the Company recognised Pazhassi Raja as the head of Kottayam instead of the original Raja who was in refuge at Travancore. Raja agreed to pay 25,000 rupees as tribute to the company. But his struggle with the Mysore troops continued in Wayanad till 1793 when he freed that land also.

But by the Treaty of Seringapatam (1792) signed between the EIC and Tipu after the latter failed in Third Anglo-Mysore War, Malabar was ceded to the EIC. The East India Company then began to work for the establishment of their supremacy in Malabar. This was where the Company administration and Pazhassi Raja had opposite opinions – Pazhassi Raja helped the East India Company not because he was ready to accept Company rule but because he wanted his country Kottayam to be an independent land.

Pazhassi Raja was disturbed when he heard about the terms which the Company put forward to the Rajas of Malabar in 1792, because the EIC had signed a cowl with him in 1790 which promised to respect the independence of Kottayam. The summary of the East India Company terms in 1792 were as follows:
* The Raja to be able to rule as before, but the East India Company to control him &quot;in case of oppressing inhabitants&quot;.
* A resident to be appointed to enquire about &quot;complaints of oppression&quot;.
* Two persons on the part of the company and two persons on the part of the Raja to make valuation of the land revenue of Kottayam.
* The tax to be paid by each subject to be ascertained.
* The Raja&#x27;s tribute to be settled in October 1792 according to the appearance of crop.
* The EIC share of the pepper to be delivered at a price fixed by their administration in December 1792.
* The remainder of the pepper to be bought only by merchants appointed by the company.

These terms converted monarchs to mere agents of the East India Company. Rajas were now stripped of their right to rule as they willed; they also lost control over their economies.

Kottayam was represented by Vira Varma, uncle of Pazhassi Raja during talks with the East India Company in 1792. Vira Varma concluded a treaty with Company = by which he accepted all terms and conditions put forward by them.

==Resistance to Company rule in India — the Cotiote War==
Pazhassi Raja resisted the East India Company from 1793 onwards till his death in 1805. He fought two wars to resist Company intervention in the domestic affairs of his kingdom. From 1793 to 1797 he fought over the question of the management of Kottayam and from 1800 to 1805 over the issue of who was to be master of Wynad. The East India Company called their wars with Pazhassi Rajah as Cotiote War.

===First revolt (1793–1797)===

Pazhassi Raja was not on good terms with his uncle Vira Varma, Raja of Kurumbranad. In 1793, foxy Vira Varma who had surrendered Kottayam to the EIC back in 1792, convinced Company commissioners to let him collect tax in Kottayam. He calculated that a good collection might please the EIC and that they would let him seize all of Kottayam. The company had by this time adopted a hostile approach to Pazhassi Raja who had consistently refused to accept Company suzerainty and hence they made the obedient Vira Varma head of Kottayam Pazhassi Raja was angry at this move. He felt betrayed. After all, he was the only Raja in Northern Malabar to have helped the East India Company consistently in the war with Mysore.

Vira Varma Raja, on the one hand, undertook to collect tax in Kottayam directly, but on the other hand, he encouraged Pazhassi Raja to oppose the company&#x27;s domination. Moreover, the tax imposed by the company was beyond the peasants&#x27; capacity to pay. They resisted attempts to collect these taxes by the agents of the East India Company, and Pazhassi Raja took up their cause.

In 1793 Pazhassi Raja made sure that no tax was collected in Kottayam by the EIC – as a mark of his protest. He also threatened that if Company officials did not give up their enumeration of pepper vines, he would have the vines destroyed. Local Company authorities, however, debated with Raja and soon both discovered Vira Varma&#x27;s deceptions. The East India Company put forward a solution acceptable to the Raja by which 20 percent of gross revenue would go to Raja and another 20 percent would go for temple expenses. No tax would be imposed on temple property in the immediate future.

In 1793 Tipu&#x27;s Vakils protested to the Company that Pazhassi Raja, who was an EIC subsidiary, had overrun most of Wayanad. Soon the Raja was supreme in the Wayanad Plateau.

But the Governor General unwisely revoked the agreement in 1794 and gave Kottayam to Kurumbranad Raja on a five-year lease. The Raja was very angry at this decision and decided to retaliate by ruling his country as per customary law. The year before the lease was concluded the Raja had provided asylum to a Nayar noble, Narangoli Nambiar of the Iruvazinad royal clan, who had been declared an outlaw by the East India Company for the murder of three men who had killed his kinsman. The Raja&#x27;s kind treatment of Nambiar irritated the EIC. The EIC also became angry that the Raja had executed by impalement two robbers as per customary law. The Company planned to arrest Raja &#x27;for murder&#x27; but gave up the idea as the Raja had a bodyguard of 500 well-armed Wayanad Nayars.

In 1795, after a year, Vira Varma Raja got Kottayam on lease but was not able to collect tax there due to the efforts of his nephew Raja. So East India Company troops arrived in Kottayam to help Vira Varma&#x27;s tax collectors, but Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s men resisted them with success.

In 1796 orders were issued from Bombay to collect tax arrears for 2 years in Kottayam. For the Company administration, no more pretexts were needed to arrest Raja. 300 men under Lieutenant James Gordon marched from Talassery and seized Raja&#x27;s fortified house at Pazhassi-but Raja fled four days earlier to Manattana (near Kottiyur). Gordon sacked the palace where traditional treasure of Raja was kept. Raja was angry at Gordon&#x27;s actions and sent a letter to the Supervisor at Thalassery.

Raja was also angry that one of his former generals, named Pazhayamviden Chandu, had become an agent of Kurumbranad Raja and what angered him even more was that this turncoat had the audacity to boss him with Vira Varma&#x27;s and EIC blessings. Raja shifted his HQ to Purali Range and then into Wayanad. Raja then blocked all Company communications between Wayanad and Low Malabar through Kuttiyadi Pass. The EIC retaliated by cutting all communications between Raja and Low Malabar. But as they did not have enough troops to chase him they waited for reinforcements.

The East India Company commandant was Colonel Dow, who Raja knew well from the Siege of Thalassery. Raja thought that this old friend might help him mediate with the Company administration. Raja offered to give up the struggle provided he was pardoned and his treasure and house restored. The Colonel and Raja being old soldiers hated needless bloodshed, so he forwarded Raja&#x27;s request to the Commissioners, who though they were bitterly opposed to Raja&#x27;s independent style, agreed to the Colonel&#x27;s request as there was a risk that Raja might ally with Tipu.

So Northern Superintendent ordered the restoration of the Raja&#x27;s house [but not treasure], and the Raja&#x27;s pardon was confirmed by the Bombay and Supreme Governments. But the orders of government were communicated to the Raja via Vira Varma – which meant that uncle Raja took care not to report to his nephew that the company had agreed to his requests. Uncle Raja had a vested interest in the war between the company and his nephew Pazhassi Raja.

Vira Varma also removed Kaitheri Ambu, a favourite noble and general of Raja, from home administration of Kottayam. Ambu along with followers went to Kannavam [also spelled &quot;Kannavath&quot; and &quot;Kannoth&quot;], where he planned and executed a mass resistance with people&#x27;s support, which made sure that Vira Varma could make no tax collection in Kottayam. But Ambu acted clearly on guidance of Raja, who felt the expulsion of Ambu was another of his uncle&#x27;s conspiracies to undermine him.

Raja feared that the East India Company planned to seize him [not knowing that their truce terms were kept blocked from him by his uncle] and retreated into the depths of Wayanad. Company troop build-up in Wayanad also amplified his doubts. However, Raja was still eager to avoid a war and came to meet the Northern Superintendent with a bodyguard of 1500 armed Nayars. Vira Varma Raja was also ordered to be present. Pazhassi Raja&#x27;s main demand was that Kottayam must be under his rule, a demand to which his uncle was not ready to accede.

The EIC Commissioners&#x27; attitude also was arrogant; they were already prejudiced against Raja and were therefore blind towards Raja&#x27;s logical argument that Vira Varma had no business in Kottayam. As talks broke down, the Commissioners&#x27; issued a proclamation in Kottayam that if those Kottayam men in service of Raja did not desert him and come home, they would be declared enemies and their properties confiscated. But this proclamation had little effect in Kottayam where resistance to Company-Kurumbranad rule became stronger.

The East India Company, to their horror, found out that a large number of Vira Varma&#x27;s troops had deserted to join ranks of insurgents and Vira Varma himself was not much interested to help the company; after all his aim was to create a flare-up between his nephew and the EIC for sake of pure self-interest.

Raja then visited the Mysorean commandant at Karkankotta in 1796 and in 1797 held an audience with his old enemy Tipu in Mysore, who posted 6000 men at Karkankotta to aid Raja in case of war and to supply ammunition to rebels. He also began to collect troops and armaments. War was imminent. 1200 troops and artillery under a Major General was sent by the Bombay Government to deal with Pazhassi. The company also began to set up outposts in Kottayam and sent more troops to Wayanad.

In early 1797, the Nayar militia uprose all over Kottayam and Company outposts were trapped in a true state of siege. Partisan bands became active all over Kottayam and harassed reinforcements and supply convoys. The case was similar in Wayanad where East India Company troops that moved out of the safety of their garrisons risked being harried by Kurichia bowmen. The EIC suffered a good deal of loss in terms of men, ammunition and stores in these ambuscades.

====Victory at Periya Pass====

This event was the most important in the whole war. In 1797, Colonel Dow &amp; force marches into Wayanad. His plan was to block Periya Pass and then crush a large rebel force in Kannoth once their retreat is blocked.

Reinforcements under Lieutenant Mealy were to reach Dow at Periya, but on way they were severely harassed by a force of Nayars and Kurichias and suffered a casualty of 105 men. So instead of Periya they retreated to their original base.

Dow&#x27;s troops suffered chronic shortage of supplies and so Dow applied for reinforcements and re-supplies to be sent under Major Anderson of Bowles&#x27; regiment. But as Mappila guides of Anderson deserted at last moment. That caused a delay in journey of Anderson-a delay that had fatal consequence for the EIC.

Dow then received news that Tipu had sent sepoys to aid Raja as Tipu considered the Company entry into Wayanad a violation of Seringapatam Pact. Dow decided that he will go to Talassery to consult authorities there and to plan a greater operation to deal with troops of Raja and Tipu simultaneously in Wayanad. He left with a small band of men but was ambushed on way by Raja&#x27;s men aided by Mysorean sepoys but Dow escaped unhurt.

The day after he left, an EIC force of 1100 under Major Cameroon in Periya decided to descend into Kottayam via Periya Pass as their supplies have exhausted.

But what they did not know was that Raja who learned of the true state of the Company expeditionary force laid a trap for them-he ordered troops lay concealed in camouflaged stockades built on both sides of the pass. Once the whole Company force entered the narrow pass, hidden troops were to pounce on their enemy who must be caught unawares.

Plan worked well and what followed was great slaughter of the Company force. Had it not been for the arrival of Major Anderson&#x27;s force the following day, hardly any would have survived due to lack of medical care. Most of the enemy were killed and all their guns, ammunition, baggage and cattle were plundered along with Union colours. Senior Company officers like Major Cameroon, Lieutenant Nugent, Lieutenant Madge, and Lieutenant Rudderman were killed in action.

Around this time, Commissioners took a decision on the advice of Swaminatha Pattar, a Tamil Brahmin who was the minister of Zamorin that sowed the eventual downfall of Pazhassi Raja. They decided to raise an irregular force of local traitors to harass Pazhassi Raja. This force was a forerunner of the Kolkar, who became hated because of their support of the company and cruelty to resisters and people.

But for time being, Raja was in a strong position. On account of the disasters suffered by their army, Bombay Government sent a Committee of Government composed of men of highest ranks-Commander-In-Chief Lieutenant-General Stuart and Governor Jonathan Duncan. They decided to make peace as they were anxious that guerrilla warfare in a mountainous and forested terrain could last long and that Raja might join forces with Tipu or French. They also decided that Kurumbranad Raja Vira Varma should be ousted from administration of Kottayam. Rajas of Chirakkal and Parappanad acted as mediators in negotiation between Raja and the East India Company and a peace pact was signed between Pazhassi and the Company in 1797.

The Treaty of 1797 agreed on following points:
* Pazhassi Raja was to be &#x27;pardoned&#x27;.
* He will be returned his treasure.
* He will be provided an annual allowance of 8000 rupees.
* He will be given back his confiscated house at Pazhassi.
* Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja will be head of Kottayam.

A pardon and restoration of property was also extended to Narangoli Nambiar of Iruvazinad.

Thus Raja&#x27;s efforts of four years ended in a political victory. Peace dawned after four years of antagonism and war.

Tipu Sultan in his letter to French government notes with glee that East India Company had lost 1,000 European soldiers and 3,000 native sepoys in four years of war between the Presidency armies and Kottayam army.

===Undeclared hostilities (1797–1800)===

Despite the peace treaty of 1797, real peace did not emerge between Pazhassi Raja and the East India Company. Skirmishes continued across Kottayam. The main reason for this was that the Company did not attempt to end its efforts to annex Kottayam and collect tax. But this was successfully foiled by partisans of Pazhassi Raja headed by Kaitheri Ambu. Pazhassi Raja also went ahead with his policy of defiance of East India Company directions, continued with his military enlargement program and even shifted his seat of power to Mananthavadi in Wayanad – all of which were deemed as &quot;injurious to interests of Company in Kottayam&quot; by Colonel Dow, the Company representative in Kottayam. But since Raja clearly had the upper hand since the victory of 1797, the East India Company was powerless to put an end to his activities.

===Second revolt and death (1800–1805)===

After the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the East India Company. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annex it to either Canara or Coimbatore. But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja and Pazhassi had been in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi interpreted the move as an encroachment on his country&#x27;s ancient provinces. Raja retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars which was now supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans, latter being ex-soldiers of Tipu who became unemployed after Tipu&#x27;s death.

The Company administration at Madras appointed Major General Arthur Wellesley as the Presidency army commandant of Mysore, Canara &amp; Malabar.

He planned a double-pronged move from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad and began preparations for that end. Raja observed Major General-latter had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja also recruited numerous men which so alarmed Wellesley that latter even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels so as to check Raja&#x27;s recruitment.

Raja learned that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja who understood that Major General&#x27;s absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with Unni Mootha Mooppan, a Walluvanad Mappila leader &amp; his men and soon several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar also joined Raja with their men.

By monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm Company outposts in Kottayam. Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture rebel-held Kottayam. But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications with Wayanad so as to starve Raja of supplies. But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley decided to smash Raja by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad, Manjeri Athan Gurikkal an Ernad Mappila leader along with his followers agreed to support of Raja.

By 1801, a large East India Company force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar. Raja became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of the East India Company, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom.

Raja had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings. First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support. But the EIC were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja then visited his secret bases in Kottayam and then moved into Kadathanad and into jungles of Kurumbranad. The East India Company were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish them for their help to rebel Raja.

As a part of their policies to quell the rebellion, Peruvayal Nambiar who was arrested was hanged. The East India Company also threatened to issue a penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks time. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.

Following execution of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with his charged duties. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.

All these &#x27;reforms&#x27; paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people quickly became incensed. MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his &#x27;reforms&#x27; and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja&#x27;s men were prepared for a rebellion.

====Capture of Panamaram Fort====
The first major event was the capture of Panamaram Fort. Edachena Kungan who planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali. So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia force would be overwhelmed by gun-fire and numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take risk.

The whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two generals and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed. Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.(The remains of the fort can be seen now near Panamaram High School).

Wellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam. Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja&#x27;s war. 3000 men volunteered. They were posted at Valliyurkav at Mananthavadi, Motimjarra [?], and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordsmen, but some had muskets.

Edachena Kungan led an attack on a Company detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill luck of rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked Company army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners of war.

Besides, East India Company reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But they could find rebels nowhere.

The rebels now concentrated in Kottayam. In 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur. The Company administration were frustrated by Kottayam people&#x27;s total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad* &amp; Payyormala* and people were sympathetic to rebels. Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the Company outpost there but had to retreat, though they suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought against the Presidency troops openly. Raja&#x27;s army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri. An estimated 3350 partisans of Pazhassi Raja took part in this operation that extended south as far as Ernad.

In March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition. They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army. This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.

In 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.

In 1803, the East India Company had 8,147 soldiers to fight Pazhassi Raja. But as the situation was slipping out of control, the EIC military command in Malabar requested for another 5,000 men. This reinforcement arrived in early 1804 and thus increasing their total force to 13,000 men.

In 1804, a large Presidency army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action. Most importantly Thomas Hervey Baber, a civil servant was appointed as Sub-Collector. It was he who crushed Pazhassi&#x27;s Revolt forever. It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber – said to be just a &#x27;civil servant.&#x27; Baber had both a personal motive – to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws – the Inglis and Money families of Bombay. It is noteworthy that Baber&#x27;s son Henry Fearon Baber married the Granddaughter of George Harris, 1st Baron Srirangapattam and the nemesis of Tipu Sultan.

In 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar [a powerful Chirakkal noble but Raja&#x27;s sympathiser] and Raja&#x27;s men in largely forested eastern Chirakkal was defeated by the company. If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for the failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar also served their White pay-masters well.

So once more rebel force had retreated to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by East India Company who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 allied Kolkars. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja.

But rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji [?] in Wayanad. Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.

But monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October. Raja and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat. Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja&#x27;s war-effort had also succeeded.

The EIC for past couple of years did not have to suffer the loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for the Company at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-“&quot;We are not fighting 1000 men [Raja&#x27;s army] ... but one man ... Kerala Varma&quot;.”-Raja&#x27;s end would mean end of revolt.

====Betrayal and death====
T.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. The East India Company themselves admitted that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt-one of them a Chetti, found out where Raja had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.

There is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja and end of his revolt. Pazhayamviden worked with the East India Company administration as an &quot;adviser&quot; like Pallore Eman, but in reality, spied for Raja. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.

In light of the above points, it will not be far-fetched to believe that Chetti who guided Company troops to Raja&#x27;s hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.

On 30 November 1805, Raja and retainers were camped close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod [not far from Pulpally]. Raja and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of the earliest rebels to be killed was Pazhassi Raja.

But evidently, wounded Raja did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it. Raja&#x27;s contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.

The precise nature of Raja&#x27;s death is controversial. Folklore insists that he committed suicide by swallowing a diamond ring to avoid capture after he was wounded but Baber says he was killed by a clerk named Canara Menon. W. J. Wilson, who wrote on the history of the Madras Regiment, credits Captain Clafam and his six sepoys for killing. This third version is more likely as Baber was not on good terms with military authority throughout the war. He is alleged to have credited Menon so as to deny credit to Clafam and his superior Colonel Hill.

Kunjani, the wife of Raja who was taken the prisoner, committed suicide in captivity at Kappanaveedu, near Thalassery. As reprisal on his family, property was confiscated and the palace at Pazhassi was demolished and replaced with a highway. The sorry state of his family aroused sympathy in local Thiyyas, who were loyal followers and built a new house for his family.

==Assessment==
* Descriptive account of Pazhassi Raja as early as 1775 confirm his later day image as a courageous warrior committed to the freedom of his country.
* Walter Ivor, a member of Court of Directors, who had taken part in negotiations with Pazhassi Raja in 1797 notes that Company losses that year in Cotiote War exceeded their losses in Third Anglo-Mysore War.
* War waged by Pazhassi Raja was the longest insurgency against the Company in Indian history and forest warfare waged by Raja had no parallel in the history of India in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century India.
* The Company military command always wondered at the logistics of Raja&#x27;s army. How he organized supplies for his several thousand strong armies remained a puzzle for them
* To fight overwhelmingly superior enemies, Raja imparted military training to his peasantry wholesale and recruited them into his military force. This military policy of wholesale militarization was novel in the history of pre-modern Kerala. His war-effort was marked by the participation of members of all creeds, classes, and castes who took up arms due to his inspiration. Nobles, headmen, peasants, shopkeepers, merchants, artisans, and forest tribes rallied to fight in his campaigns — first the Kingdom of Mysore and later the East India Company.
* East India Company losses were severe in terms of men and ran into several thousand. Death toll was particularly high with officers of commissioned ranks. So high were the losses suffered by Bombay army regiments that operated in North Malabar that they had to be withdrawn in 1803 fearing that further losses would cripple Bombay Army as a respectable body of troops.
* Raja shared all the privations of his ordinary soldiers during the war and took part in all major military action exposing himself to personal danger. On account of these attributes, he commanded great respect of his troops.
* Royal regiments from Britain also took part in Cotiote War along with Company troops. 
* Anti-British rebels in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also were allied to Pazhassi Raja.
* Arthur Wellesely, Duke of Wellington adopted methods of guerrilla warfare used by Pazhassi Raja to defeat Napoleon&#x27;s armies in Spain.
* Memory of Pazhassi Raja and his struggle inspired freedom struggle in 20th century Kerala.

Pazhassi Raja had no selfish motive of personal power. Kurup (1988) describes him as an altruistic personality who upheld interests of his subjects and country over his personal interest. He believed that he was duty-bound to protect his subjects from exploitation and oppression. Frenz (2008) also supports this view and opines that Raja was committed to the welfare of his people and freedom of his country. She notes that Pazhassi Raja opted for fight the East India Company when it became clear to him that the Company administration would not respect the independence of his country and welfare of his subjects. She noted that Raja considered it a personal failure as a leader if he failed to uphold sovereignty of his kingdom.

Criticism leveled against Raja for allying with the East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not rational in light of an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially not because he was their vassal, but because the Kingdom of Mysore was an enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and East India Company were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it was understandable that many leaders of Malabar – Pazhassi Raja included – allied with the company to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.

Swaminatha Iyer, a Company agent had noted as early as 1797 that extreme popularity of Raja was because he remained in his country with his subjects during Mysore invasions and shared with them the trials and tribulations and also due to his extreme generosity to this peasantry. It was on account of love and support from his subjects that Raja could evade and fight the East India Company for a decade even when he had a bounty on his head.

After his fellow Rajas in Malabar submitted to East India Company after 1798, Raja himself knew well that he will be defeated and killed in the long run if he chose to continue to fight against the East India Company. But yet he refused to compromise. In a letter to Kalyat Kuttieman, he revealed his intent to resist the company&#x27;s authority to the end.

He took initiative to rebuild his country which was devastated by Mysore invasions. As part of this, he borrowed money from Tellicherry Factory and gave financial help to his peasants to resume agriculture along with distribution of seeds and cattle. This was in contrast to rest of Rajas of Malabar who squeezed peasants. This was one reason why his popularity with masses remained high.

Raja is also credited with the spread of agriculture in Wynad. He started a program that encouraged tribesmen in Wynad to adopt settled agriculture. As part of this program, he instructed his vassals in Wynad to distribute cattle and seeds to tribesmen in Wynad.

==Supporters==

Pazhassi Raja was assisted by eighty chieftains during his wars and some were entrusted with administrative responsibilities also. Most prominent of them are Chengoteri Chathu, Pallur Eman, Kaitheri Ambu, Kannavath Nambiar, Thalakkal Chandu, Sankaran Moopan and Edachena Kunkan.

==Forest forts==

In his decades-long war to oust invaders, Rajah developed an elaborate system of cantonments and forts in the jungly and mountainous part of his country.

Four of them are most important – granite fort on Purali range [modern Muzhakunnu] which was built by his ancestor Harischandra Perumal over a thousand years ago. He had another granite fort at Manatana. In Wayanad, he had a great fort in Mananthavady which was reported to have ability to house his whole army of 6000 men. He also had a stronghold in Todikulam near Kannavam which belonged to his supporter Kannavath Sankaran.

Of all his strongholds, none survive today such as Kottamalai in Cherambadi and Nellakotai in Pandalur etc. Only ruins of Purali fort survive today. It is today a heap of granite boulders. Only a tank still survives today. A nearby black-stone cave where Raja once lived can still be found.

<text>.ye is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Republic of Yemen.

==History==
In 2015, when the Houthis took over the Yemeni capital, the rebel forces also took over the main internet provider and distributor of the .ye domain, TeleYemen, which remains under their control. According to DomainTools, 1152 .ye domain names were registered as of 2018.

== Regulations ==
In order to register a .YE domain, you must have a company registered in Yemen. However, some registrars provide a local presence service for non-Yemeni clients. Domain names also need to be hosted in the Republic of Yemen.

==Second-level domains==

There are eight second-level domains:
* com.ye: Commercial Entities 
* co.ye: Companies 
* ltd.ye: Limited Companies
* me.ye: Private Individuals 
* net.ye: Network Providers
* org.ye: Non-commercial Organizations 
* plc.ye: Public Companies
* gov.ye: Government and Governmental Systems

==Internationalized domain==
An internationalized country code top-level domain has been planned for the Republic of Yemen, intended for domain names in the local Arabic language. The string اليمن (&quot;al-Yaman&quot;) was registered and approved for this purpose in March 2011, but it was not activated and lower level domains were not granted at that time.

<text>.zw is the internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Zimbabwe.

Although no registry website is shown in the IANA whois listing, .co.zw registrations are presently being taken by the Zimbabwe Internet Service Providers Association (ZISPA), whose charter claims that one of the purposes of the organization&#x27;s founding was to oversee the .zw domain. TelOne is also listed as the administrative and technical contact of the domain.

.ac.zw registrations are being taken by the University of Zimbabwe. Applications are handled by this institution&#x27;s Computer Centre. As with the general norm, .ac.zw registrations are for academic institutions.

.org.zw registrations are taken by the country&#x27;s fixed telecommunications provider, TelOne. These are intended for use by NGOs, and similar organisations but any restrictions are not clear.

.gov.zw and .mil.zw are used for military and government websites for Zimbabwe.

.zw domains are used by less than 0.1% of all websites worldwide.

<text>.zm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Zambia. Registrants of .zm domains must &quot;have a presence in Zambia&quot;.

==Second-level domains==

Registrants are required to register domains at the third level under an existing second-level domain (SLD). There are eleven second-level domains:

* ac.zm: Academic institutions
* biz.zm: Businesses
* co.zm: Commercial entities
* com.zm: Commercial entities
* edu.zm: Academic institutions
* gov.zm: Government
* info.zm: &quot;Information&quot;
* mil.zm: Zambian military
* net.zm: Networks
* org.zm: Non-commercial organizations
* sch.zm: Schools

The designations above are assumed based on observed practices and standard conventions, as ZICTA (the ccTLD registry) do not maintain online documentation codifying this. Most entities will generally register either a .co.zm or .org.zm domain, if they choose to use the ccTLD rather than a generic top-level domain.

The one documented exception to the requirement to register at the third level is that &quot;registered ISPs&quot; may register at the second level—e.g., zamtel.zm. However, there are several undocumented variances to this rule—e.g., the Bank of Zambia&#x27;s domain is boz.zm, and the regulator (ZICTA) operates under zicta.zm.

==Registrars==

ISPs are required to be registered with ZICTA, and only registered ISPs may be accredited as registrars. ZICTA lists ISPs on their website.

<text>Bear River is a small clear slow-moving river in the U.S. state of Michigan. long, it is the largest tributary of Little Traverse Bay in the northwest of the lower peninsula. Traverse Bay is on Lake Michigan. The river is formed as the outflow of Walloon Lake on the boundary between Charlevoix County and Emmet County, draining from the southeast end of the lake at near the community of Walloon Lake in Melrose Township. M-75 has its northern terminus in a junction with US 131 nearby.

The river flows east for about before turning north through Bear Creek Township, angling northwest to empty into Little Traverse Bay in Petoskey at . Petoskey was at first known as &quot;Bear River&quot; until being renamed in 1873. The Bear River itself has also been known as &quot;Bear Creek&quot; and &quot;Ellis Creek&quot;.

The river has excellent fishing and provides opportunities for peaceful canoeing or kayaking. The river is great for smelt fishing. For most of its path in Emmet County, River Road and the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay Railway parallel the river on its west banks.

<doc id="1113713" wikidata="Q1778229" url="?curid=1113713" title="United Nations Operation in Somalia II">
<text>The United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) was the second phase of the United Nations intervention in Somalia and took place from March 1993 until March 1995, following the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991. UNOSOM II carried on from the transitory United States-controlled (UN-sanctioned) Unified Task Force (UNITAF), which had been preceded by UNOSOM I. Notably, UNOSOM II embarked on a nation-building mission, diverging from its predecessors. As delineated in UNSCR 814, the operation&#x27;s objectives were to aid in relief provision and economic rehabilitation, foster political reconciliation, and re-establish political and civil administrations across Somalia.

UNOSOM II was a substantial multinational initiative, uniting over 22,000 troops from 27 nations. This operation marked the largest multilateral force ever assembled for peacekeeping, and at that time, it was the costliest UN operation. The operation abandoned the careful rules of engagement set by UNITAF, and notably was the first UN mission authorized from the start to use military force proactively, beyond self-defense.

Four months into its mandate in June 1993, UNOSOM II transformed into a military campaign as it found itself entangled in armed conflict with Somali factions, predominantly against the Somali National Alliance (SNA) led by Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. As the intervention progressed, military operations against the SNA took focus, relegating the task of political reconciliation, institution-building and humanitarian aid to a peripheral role. Three months into the conflict, the US military implemented Operation Gothic Serpent to assist UNOSOM II against the SNA with special forces. Soon after, the infamous Battle of Mogadishu took place, signifying the end of the hunt for Aidid and military operations in Somalia. The United States withdrew six months after the battle, and the remaining UN forces departed from Somalia in early 1995, concluding the operation.

UNOSOM II faced heavy criticism for alleged human rights abuses, violations of international law, and the use of excessive force, attracting scrutiny from a wide range of humanitarian organizations, academics and journalists. Furthermore, the operation was widely criticized for an overemphasis on military operations, diverging from its original humanitarian intent.&quot;&quot; The humanitarian impact and number of lives saved is disputed.

==Background==
1991 saw the outbreak of the full-scale Somali Civil War, which led to the collapse of the Somali Democratic Republic. The following year, a famine emerged, driven by both a major drought and the major fighting that engulfed the nation’s breadbasket in the southern regions.

The United Nations created the UNOSOM I mission in April 1992 in response to the crisis. During July 1992 the first UN troops landed in Somalia, seven Pakistani military troops under the command of Brigadier-General Imtiaz Shaheen. In August 1992, UNOSOM I head Mohammed Sahnoun secured an agreement with Mohamed Farah Aidid of the Somali National Alliance (SNA) to allow 500 UN peacekeepers, with the condition that any further deployments required SNA approval. However, later that month, UN Secretary-General Boutros Ghali announced plans to expand UNOSOM to 3,500 troops without consultation, to the surprise of both Sahnoun and the SNA. Sahnoun recognized this move would undermine his local support, as it had been made without consulting Somali leaders and elders. He attempted to delay the deployment in order to renegotiate, but was overruled.&quot;&quot; The intervention began fueling nationalist opposition to foreign troops, strengthening support for Aidid’s SNA, which condemned the UN’s perceived colonial practices. 

The UN Secretariat believed Somalia represented an ideal candidate for a test case of a UN operation in expanded size and mandate. In the view of some top UNOSOM I commanders, the scope of the famine in Somalia was being exaggerated in order to justify using Somalia as an experiment for &#x27;conflict resolution&#x27;. The United States had various motives for military involvement in Somalia. The US armed forces wanted to prove it&#x27;s capability to conduct major &#x27;Operations Other Than War&#x27;, while the US State Department wanted to set a precedent for humanitarian military intervention in the post-Cold War era.

On 9 December 1992, American troops began landing on the Somali coastline at Mogadishu. Over 20,000 US troops were deployed. The famine in Somalia was already abating as UNITAF began landing. The operations of UNOSOM I were suspended. UNITAF was authorized under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The United States designed the UNITAF mission to be a transitional action under U.S. control, structured into four phases. Initially, troops were deployed to secure key harbor and airport sites in Mogadishu and Baledogle, forming the operation&#x27;s base. The security zone was then extended to encompass the surrounding regions of southern Somalia. The third phase involved further southern expansion of the security zone into Kismayo and Bardera while ensuring secure routes for humanitarian operations. Finally, in the last phase the U.S. transferred operations to the UN and withdrew most UNITAF forces.

=== Expansion of mandate ===
On 3 March 1993, the Secretary-General submitted to the Security Council his recommendations for effecting the transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM II. He noted that despite the size of the UNITAF mission, a secure environment was not yet established. There was still no effective functioning government or local security/police force. The Secretary-General concluded that, should the Security Council determine that the time had come for the transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM II, the latter should be endowed with enforcement powers under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia. UNOSOM II would therefore seek to complete the task begun by UNITAF. The new mandate would also empower UNOSOM II to assist in rebuilding their economic, political and social life, so as to recreate a Somali State. Most notably it would also mandate the disarmament of Somali militias.

While Somalia was not reincorporated into a UN trusteeship as it had been in the 1950s, UNOSOM II was entrusted with the power to make decisions on behalf of the Somali people. This significant shift in mandate incited numerous allegations of UN colonialism. The United Nations, by invoking Chapter VII, essentially transformed the scope of its operations in Somalia, a move that would become a major point of contention in the near future. According to UNOSOM II advisor John Drysdale the majority of Somali political leaders rejected the notion of UN administering any aspect of Somalia, though some prominent figures such as Gen. Mohamed Abshir called for the return of trusteeship. The shift raised suspicions among a wide spectrum of Somalis, inciting concerns about the UN&#x27;s possible attempts to reestablish a trusteeship. Aidid&#x27;s faction was particularly vocal about these apprehensions but was not alone. A variety of other Somali factions, including that of Aidid&#x27;s main adversary, Ali Mahdi, also expressed similar concerns.

=== Addis Ababa Reconciliation Conference and creation of UNOSOM II ===
During March 1993, several weeks before UNOSOM II was created, the first UN sponsored Somali peace conference was being held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The &quot;Conference on National Reconciliation&quot; consisted of the majority of Somalis factions and leaders. UN Special Representative Lansana Kouyate of Guinea warned the delegates of the national reconciliation conference that the UN was going to invoke its Chapter VI powers across the entirety of Somalia unless they came to an agreement by 25 March 1993. The conference finalized an agreement 24 hours past the deadline. On 26 March 1993 UNOSOM II, was established by the Security Council in Resolution 814, though did not formally take over operations in Somalia until UNITAF was dissolved just over a month later on 4 May 1993. 

UNOSOM II was the first UN mission authorized from the start to use military force proactively, beyond self-defense. John Drysdale notes that by invoking Chapter VII, the UNOSOM II Force Commander could operate with near impunity depending on their interpretation of &quot;Article 42&quot; of Chapter VII. &quot;Article 42&quot; offered no rules of engagement, in effect gave UNOSOM II forces the power to make arbitrary detentions and offer no right to habeas corpus for Somalis. In Drysdale&#x27;s view UNITAF had avoided armed conflict with Somali factions due to the careful rules of engagement created by the head of the operation, US Marine Lt. Gen. Robert B. Johnston. Johnston&#x27;s approach, which focused above all on winning the Somali&#x27;s public confidence, was lost during the transfer to the far more aggressive UNOSOM II mandate.

== Structure ==
UNOSOM II was composed of four main divisions. They were officially led and coordinated in Somalia by the representative of the UN Secretary-General, retired US Admiral Jonathan Howe. The four divisions were tasked with:

# Force Command: Maintaining overall security in Somalia and protecting UN operations. The Force Commander was a Turkish General named Cevik Bir, although his second in command, Major General Thomas M. Montgomery, a US military officer was noted to wield more power and influence, as the command structure was dominated by US officers. Montgomery headed the US Quick Reaction Force and reported directly to the US Pentagon.
# Division for Humanitarian Relief and Rehabilitation: Planning and coordination of all humanitarian activities.
# Division for Political Affairs: Promoting political reconciliation and building of transitional governmental and administrative structures.
# Justice Division: Formation of civil police and rehabilitation of the judiciary. Also tasked with monitoring violations of international law.

UNOSOM II had a strength of 30,000 personnel, including 22,000 troops and 8,000 logistic and civilian staff from Algeria, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Botswana, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Jordan, Malaysia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Spain, South Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States and Zimbabwe. The United States military provided 1,167 troops and numerous helicopter gunships for a Quick Reaction Force, which would remain completely under US operational control.Despite UNOSOM II being composed of a coalition of twenty-seven countries, most of the decision makers and many of the staff were Americans, giving the United States significant control over much of the operation. It was observed that very few nations involved had any representation in the UN military command structure. Due to this, many states providing troops to the operation insisted on maintaining command structures with their own respective governments, which would result in numerous future inter-UNOSOM II disputes between contingents. UNOSOM II Force Commander Cevik Bir openly admitted that the critical posts in his headquarters were filled by Americans by May 1993. In addition to this the representative of the UN Secretary-General in Somalia, retired US Admiral Jonathan Howe, staffed the UNOSOM II headquarters with twenty-eight US officers in key positions. Months into the operation, following the 5 June 1993 killings of the Pakistanis and the passing of UNSCR 837, the US effectively took complete lead of the mission. In the months following US officers operated with minimal consultations with UN headquarters in New York. Marine Lt. Gen. Robert B. Johnston, head of UNITAF, stated that although in his view UNITAF had been success US efforts and losses were in vain if UNOSOM II was also not successful.

UNOSOM II divided Somalia into five distinct zones. Northwest, Northeast, Central, South and Mogadishu.

==In operation==
A federalist government based on 18 autonomous regions was agreed upon by the leaders of Somalia&#x27;s various armed factions. It was the objective of UNOSOM II to support this new system and initiate nation-building in Somalia. This included disarming the various factions, helping the people to set up a representative government, and restoring infrastructure.

=== Growing hostilities between UNOSOM and the SNA ===
Major disagreements between the UN and the Somali National Alliance began soon after the establishment of UNOSOM II, centering on the perceived true nature of the operations political mandate. In May 1993, relations between the SNA and UNOSOM would rapidly deteriorate following two significant events.

==== Kismayo Incident ====
During the March Addis Ababa conference, the Somali National Front (SNF), a pro-Barre faction opposing Aidid, smuggled weapons into the strategic port city of Kismayo. Although the city was nominally controlled by the SNA and UNITAF forces, Gen. Hersi Morgan of the SNF ousted the Somali National Alliance forces led by Col. Omar Jess.On 7 May 1993, three days after UNOSOM II took control of Kismayo from UNITAF, the SNA made an attempt to retake the city. During the assault the Belgian peacekeepers stationed in the town intervened, considering the assault to take Kismayo an attack on their positions and consequently repelled the SNA forces. The fall of Kismayo to Gen. Morgan infuriated the Somali National Alliance. To the SNA the incident was viewed as blatant U.N. partiality, as UNITAF had failed to prevent Morgan from seizing the city and UNOSOM had then fought SNA forces who had tried to retake it. Following the loss of Kismayo, Aidid began to deeply mistrust the United States and the UN mission.

==== Mudug peace agreement ====
In early May, Gen. Aidid and Col. Abdullahi Yusuf of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) agreed to convene a peace conference for central Somalia. In light of recent conflict between the two, the initiative was seen a major step towards halting the Somali Civil War. Gen. Aidid, having initiated the talks with Col. Yusuf, considered himself the conference chair, setting the agenda. Beginning 9 May, elder delegations from their respective clans, Habr Gidr and Majerteen, met. While Aidid and Yusuf aimed for a central Somalia-focused conference, they clashed with UNOSOM, which aimed to include other regions and replace Aidid&#x27;s chairmanship with ex-President Abdullah Osman, a staunch critic of Aidid. As the conference began, Aidid sought assistance from UNOSOM ambassador Lansana Kouyate, who proposed air transport for delegates and a 14-day accommodation. However, he was called back to New York and replaced by April Glaspie, following which UNOSOM retracted its offer. Aidid resorted to private aircraft to transport delegates. Following the aircraft incident, Aidid publicly rebuked the United Nations on Radio Mogadishu for interference in Somali internal affairs.

Aidid invited Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, Adm. Johnathan Howe to open the conference, which was refused. The differences between Aidid and the UN proved to be to great, and the conference proceeded without the United Nations participation. On the 2 June 1993 the conference between Gen. Aidid and Col. Abdullahi Yusuf successfully concluded. Admiral Howe was invited to witness the peace agreement, but again declined. The Galkacyo peace accord successfully ended large scale conflict in the Galgadud and Mudug regions of Somalia.

The contention between the Somali National Alliance and UNOSOM from this point forward began to manifest in anti-UNOSOM propaganda broadcast from SNA controlled Radio Mogadishu.

=== Somaliland ===
UNOSOM II had a highly contentious relationship with Somaliland, eventually resulting in the United Nations being expelled from the region. Most notably during a visit to Hargeisa, Leonard Kamungo, the head of the Political Affairs division for UNOSOM II, engaged in discussions with the President of Somaliland, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal. Kamungo warned Egal that he held the authority to deploy UNOSOM military forces in Somaliland without requiring local consent, if he deemed it necessary. This remark incensed Egal who retorted by threatening that Hargeisa &quot;would become the United Nations&#x27; Dien Bien Phu.&quot; In response, Egal gave Kamungo a 24-hour ultimatum to depart from Somaliland. UNOSOM would later be entirely expelled from the territory on Egals orders.

== UNOSOM II - SNA conflict ==

=== Radio Mogadishu and 5 June 1993 inspection ===

Radio Mogadishu was a highly popular broadcast station with the residents of the city, and was a vital piece of SNA infrastructure that had been captured following a vicious battle with Ali Mahdi&#x27;s forces. Following the Kismayo and Galkayo incidents that station began to air anti-UNOSOM propaganda, incensing high ranking UN personnel. It was feared that the broadcasts would shift the attitudes of the Somali public towards the United Nations operation, leading UNOSOM officials to resolve to close the station. In mid-May, the Pakistani contingent was asked to draw up a plan to shut down the station. The Pakistanis did not possess the technical expertise required for such an operation and requested that the US supply experts.

Importantly, Radio Mogadishu had also been an &quot;Authorized Weapons Store Site&quot; (AWSS), subject to UNOSOM inspection. It was decided the American special forces technicians would accompany a Pakistani weapons inspection team to the site in order to determine how to disable the station. Gen. Aidid and the upper echelons of the Somali National Alliance, had been made aware of the discussions to seize or destroy the station.

According to the 1994 United Nations Inquiry:
Opinions differ, even among UNOSOM officials, on whether the weapons inspections of 5 June 1993 was genuine or was merely a cover-up for reconnaissance and subsequent seizure of Radio Mogadishu.
On the morning of Saturday June 5, 1993 an element of the Pakistani force in Somalia had been tasked with the inspection of site &quot;AWSS 5&quot;, which happened to be located at Aidid controlled Radio Mogadishu. The station was popular across the city, even among those who did not like Aidid or the Habr Gidr clan and concern that UNOSOM was coming to shut it down infuriated many citizens of Mogadishu. The fighting resulted in 24 Pakistanis and dozens of Somalis killed. UNOSOM believed forces associated with Aidid were behind the attack. The 1994 UN Inquiry concluded that in absence of a &quot;...more convincing explanation,&quot; it believed the Somali National Alliance was most likely behind the attack. Despite this, the commission noted that no evidence existed to back previous UNOSOM assertions that the attack had been pre-planned or pre-meditated by the SNA, and further noted that the incident had likely been a spontaneous reaction.

=== UNSCR 837 and UNOSOM - SNA war ===

The next day, the UN responded with Resolution 837, reaffirming that the secretary-general had the authorization to &quot;take all necessary measures against those responsible for the armed attacks and to establish the effective authority of UNOSOM II throughout Somalia.&quot; This was essentially a declaration of war on Aidid and the Somali National Alliance, leading to numerous armed confrontations between the two parties. Although UNOSOM II had fewer war-fighting resources than UNITAF, it adopted a more ambitious and aggressive stance. Nevertheless, several UNOSOM contingents expressed opposition to the aggressive military posture. They viewed an offensive as politically misguided and militarily untenable. As the conflict dragged on, these contingents began advocating for a diplomatic resolution. International observers notably criticized the UN&#x27;s decision to initiate a military offensive as &#x27;incomprehensible&#x27;, given the dynamics of Somali society. Professor Ioan M. Lewis asserted that the UN made an unwise choice to resort to military force, which led to substantial Somali casualties, rather than attempting to politically isolate Aidid and launch an independent legal inquiry. The UN offensive that followed UNSCR 837 had significant negative repercussions for UNOSOM II as it incited hostility from across a wide spectrum of Somali society, extending to those Somali who had been most favorable of the intervention.

==== June 1993 UNOSOM offensive ====
On 12 June 1993 US troops began a military offensive around Mogadishu. On 17 June, a warrant with a $25,000 reward was issued by Admiral Jonathan Howe for information leading to the arrest of Aidid, but he was never captured. That same day, Aidid&#x27;s compound and Radio Mogadishu were directly targeted by US AC-130 gunships. Over the following weeks, strikes were carried out all over Mogadishu with AC-130s and attack helicopters. UNOSOM began to greatly increase its firepower in Mogadishu and started making deliberate shows of force with Italian and American helicopters over the city. The US Quick Reaction Force, which had been split up into several different hot spots in Somalia, was entirely recalled to Mogadishu. BBC East Africa correspondent Mark Doyle described the war between the Somali National Alliance and UNOSOM forces as seen by journalists in Mogadishu:
Typical daylight hours in south Mogadishu thunder to the sound of American helicopter gunships criss-crossing the skies at low level; militia with small arms or rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs) take aim at what they see as an offensive provocation. It&#x27;s not unusual, from the main hotel in south Mogadishu, to view open battles, with U.S. helicopters firing 20-millimeter cannons at apparent militia ground positions. From other vantage points, full-scale battles have been observed pitting Turkish tanks, Pakistani APCs, and American Humvees against the militia. All this has taken place in a heavily built-up urban environment, with the inevitable heavy casualties. By night, the macabre events continue. Loud explosions are common as militia mortars are aimed at the UN compound or the fortified, UN-controlled airport. UN forces&#x27; flares light up the sky in an often futile attempt to pinpoint their enemy. Slow dull tracer fire streaks across the blackness from the militias&#x27; weapons. The crack-crack-crack and flash-flash-flash of cannons fired from U.S. helicopter gunships can be seen spitting at apparent militia emplacements.
In the week after the offensive, US officers and intelligence experts contended that Aidid&#x27;s command and control capability over his SNA fighters had been significantly weakened, and the organization&#x27;s morale had taken a substantial hit. They also believed that the intensive American aerial bombardment had decimated most of the Somali National Alliance&#x27;s arsenal. American officials involved in the war estimated that the SNA had no more than 300 loyal fighters, motivated merely by cash or Khat handouts. However, interviews conducted by the Washington Post with Somali insurgents painted a contrasting picture: a highly motivated and committed military force whose morale seemed to strengthen as the conflict intensified. Months into the conflict, US and UN officials would concede that they had, &quot;...greatly underestimated their enemy,&quot;

Following the passing of UNSCR 837, the hunt for Aidid characterized much of the UNOSOM II intervention. The increasing tempo of military operations being carried out in Mogadishu caused civilian casualties and began to seriously affect the relationship between UN troops and the Somali people. UNOSOM forces began to be increasingly perceived as foreign interlopers and imperialists, particularly after incidents such as the 13 June mass shooting, when UN troops fired upon a demonstration with a machine gun killing 20 Somalis, many women and children, and a US helicopter attack on Digfer Hospital on 17 June. The Times reported that in the month following the offensive at least 200 civilians had been directly killed by foreign troops. Many Mogadishu residents were deeply disturbed by the effects of heavy weaponry utilized by UN forces in Mogadishu, such as AC-130s, helicopter gunships, wire-guided TOW missiles and rockets. Airstrikes in particular heavily affected Somali civilians and sparked hostility. Each major armed confrontation with UN forces was noted to have the deleterious effect of increasing Aidid&#x27;s stature with the Somali public. In the view of Professor Mats Berdal of the Department of War Studies at King&#x27;s College, the conduct of US armed forces during the conflict demonstrated that the US military was not attuned to the requirements of low-level military operations that Somalia required at the time. He argued that, &quot;[There is] a distinctive mindset and approach to low-intensity operations which had been shaped by the American experience during and after Vietnam, and by a deeply entrenched belief in the efficacy of technology and firepower as a means of minimizing one’s own casualties. It is an approach that was inappropriate to the particular circumstances of Somalia.&quot;The UNOSOM offensive had significant negative political consequences for the intervention as it alienated the Somali people, strengthened political support for Aidid, and led to growing criticism of the operation internationally. As a result numerous UNOSOM II contingents began to increasingly push for a more conciliatory and diplomatic approach with the SNA. Relief agencies and humanitarian organizations publicly distanced themselves from the UN offensive. The backlash from Somali political and military factions against the offensive was so profound that even groups previously ambivalent or antagonistic towards Aidid began to perceive the UN and US forces as foreign oppressors. The escalating UNOSOM offensive resulted in the operation forfeiting potential support from other Somali factions. Former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ramesh Thakur, stated that, &quot;The scale, intensity, and frequency of the use of force by UNOSOM after June 1993 bore little resemblance to the rhetoric and expectations of when it was established, nor any recognizable relationship by then to a peacekeeping operation as defined in the UN lexicon.&quot;

British academic Alex de Waal observed that UNOSOM&#x27;s war against the insurgency set an important legal precedent, as UN forces effectively declared immunity from the laws of war. Following a US helicopter attack on Digfer Hospital, de Waal confronted UN commanders in Mogadishu asking if the operation considered itself bound by the Geneva Conventions. A UN official had responded in regard to the attack that, &quot;The normal rules of engagement do not apply in this nation.&quot; During this time, UNOSOM forces tried to disarm residents in parts of Mogadishu. Dutch journalist Linda Polman reported that US troops shelled the homes of Somalis who resisted surrendering their weapons, resulting in significant civilian casualties.

==== Bloody Monday raid ====
On 12 July 1993, a house where a meeting of clan elders was taking place was attacked by US AH-1 Cobra helicopters in what became known to the Somalis as Bloody Monday. UNOSOM claimed that they had launched a successful raid on a Somali National Alliance command and control center where hardliners had been gathered, an account that is widely disputed by Somalis, foreign journalists and human rights organizations. Johnathan Howe alleged that evidence to back UN claims could not be provided because the cameras recording the raid had jammed. The Red Cross claimed that 54 Somalis had been killed, including several notable religious elders. According to Dr. Sebastian Kaempf, the Abdi House raid represented the single most important event during UNOSOM II, as the consequences of the attack proved disastrous for UNOSOM interests in Somalia. Black Hawk Down author Mark Bowden noted 12 July had been a serious mistake and had the effect of firmly uniting a large portion of Mogadishu behind Aidid&quot;.&quot; Notable groups and organizations such as the Vatican, the Organisation of African Unity, World Vision, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called for UNOSOM to review it policies and course.

The raid exposed deep rifts and created dissension amongst the UNOSOM II coalition, which consequently began fraying the cohesion and unity of the operation. The head of the UNOSOM II Justice Division criticized the raid in a memo to head of UNOSOM, US Admiral Johnathan Howe. Further criticism of the raid came from numerous contributing states such as Ireland, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Zimbabwe, but most notably the Italian contingent, who threatened to pull out of the whole operation a few days later citing concerns that the escalation was indicative that relief role of UNOSOM II had been overtaken by an American-led campaign against Mohammed Farah Aidid. The Italians, who had ruled Somalia as a colonial territory for half a century, believed that the unprecedented attack threatened to widen the civil war and turn the Somalis against the entire UN peacekeeping force. A Pakistani officer in Mogadishu noted that the clash between the Americans and Italians was destroying the cohesion of UNOSOM II, and that a review of strategy was desperately needed. American envoy to Somalia, Robert B. Oakley, stated that after the raid countries such as Italy, France, and Zimbabwe, as well as other UNOSOM contingents, ceased their participation in operations against Aidid upon receiving orders from their respective governments. This decision weakened the United Nations&#x27; already fragile command authority. Additionally, many humanitarian efforts came to a halt, and numerous non-governmental organizations expressed their disapproval of both the United Nations and the United States. Intense diplomatic efforts were consequently made in order to avert a major split in UNOSOM II.

The strike also caused an outcry among UN civilian staffers and disenchantment over the direction of UNOSOM II for employees of the humanitarian section. At least nine UN civilian employees in Mogadishu working for the humanitarian sector either resigned or walked away from their posts in protest, including the top UNOSOM Justice Division official in Somalia, Ann Wright. Many of those who stayed commented to reporters that the United Nations had relinquished its moral authority in its war against Aidid.

The dissension in the U.N. ranks with the Italians and others over what had occurred on July 12, 1993, led to a significant lull in UNOSOM operations in Mogadishu until the August 8, 1993 killings of American soldiers. The raid would lead to a significant increase in attacks on UNOSOM II troops and American forces in Mogadishu being deliberately targeted by Somali factions for the first times. That month night patrols in Mogadishu were halted entirely due to the city becoming to dangerous for foreign troops.

=== Escalation of insurgency and deployment of Task Force Ranger ===
Somali militias and volunteers increasingly began targeting UNOSOM II and US forces, causing further casualties. Following the 12 July 1993 raid, firefights between the SNA and UNOSOM began occurring almost daily. By September 1993, the Pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat reported that several Somali Islamic factions, which had previously remained neutral in the war, had now tacitly allied with the SNA. When the conflict had begun in June 1993 Islamic factions had divided over whether not to fight foreign troops because Aidid had previously been a major threat to them. As civilian casualties began mounting in July and August numerous Islamic factions began to launch attacks on UNOSOM forces in Mogadishu after sunset. Independent sources in Mogadishu, corroborated by Al-Hayat, indicated that the majority of night military operations throughout 1993 were coordinated by a variety of Somali Islamic groups within the city. Notably, Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya, a prominent Somali Islamist militant organization that had previously been in conflict with Aidid&#x27;s forces in 1992, also began engaging in the insurgency against the American and UN forces. While Aidid did not overtly claim responsibility for these night operations, Al-Hayat noted that he sought to project the appearance of being the orchestrator for propaganda purposes.

As American casualties started to mount in Somalia, domestic backlash in the United States grew. Bipartisan support from the US senate began to build for a withdrawal. By August 1993, it was evident to the Clinton administration that a strategy shift was necessary to retain domestic support for US involvement in Somalia. This shift was signaled by Defense Secretary Les Aspin in his 27 August speech, advocating for a decreased military focus in UNOSOM II and urging the UN and the OAU to resume negotiations with all parties. Both the US Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor pushed for a shift towards diplomacy. Certain US officials advocated for a more aggressive response, among them was Ambassador Robert R. Gosende from the State Department. Gosende had written a cable recommending the deployment of thousands of additional troops and urged the abandonment of all diplomatic engagements with the SNA. Contrarily, General Joseph P. Hoar, who was at the helm of CENTCOM, expressed sharp disagreement with Gosende&#x27;s approach. In a confidential memo, General Hoar articulated his belief that if more American troops were needed, then control of Mogadishu was already lost.

On 8 August, insurgents detonated a remote-controlled bomb against a U.S. military vehicle and killed American soldiers for the first time. Two weeks later, another bomb injured seven. In response, President Bill Clinton approved the proposal to deploy a special task force composed of 400 US Army Rangers and Delta-force Commandos. Despite growing reservations about the effectiveness of UNOSOM military operations against the Somali National Alliance, the immediate concern of protecting US forces led to the decision to deploy elite forces. In August elite unit, named Task Force Ranger, consisting of 441 elite US troops was flown into Mogadishu and began a manhunt for Aidid in what became known as Operation Gothic Serpent.

On 15 September 1993, US Major Gen. David C. Meade conveyed in a confidential memo to his superiors that the campaign against the insurgency was faltering, both tactically and potentially operationally. He cautioned that persisting in the conflict risked catastrophe. On October 3, 1993, Task Force Ranger raided a hotel in Mogadishu to capture high ranking SNA personnel. What ensued was the longest, bloodiest and deadliest battle for US and UNOSOM II troops in Somalia. In what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, eighteen US soldiers were killed. Images of their dead bodies being dragged through the streets were broadcast on internationally, infuriating the American public.

==Fallout of the Battle of Mogadishu and the end of UNOSOM II==

On 6 October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton personally order General Joseph P. Hoar to cease all combat operations against Somali National Alliance, except in self defence. General Hoar proceeded to relay the stand down order to Generals William F. Garrison of Task Force Ranger and Thomas M. Montgomery of the American Quick Reaction Force. The following day on 7 October, Clinton publicly announced a major change in course in the mission. Substantial U.S. forces would be sent to Somalia as short term reinforcements, but all American forces would be withdrawn from the country by the end of March 1994. He defended American policy in Somalia but admitted that it had been a mistake for American forces to be drawn into the decision &quot;to personalize the conflict&quot; to Aidid. He went on to reappoint the former U.S. Special Envoy for Somalia Robert B. Oakley to signal the administrations return to focusing on political reconciliation.

The Somali National Alliance perceived the cessation of the military operation as a decisive victory. The stand down order given to U.S. forces in Somalia led other UNOSOM II contingents to effectively avoid any confrontation with the SNA. This led to the majority of patrols in Mogadishu to cease and numerous checkpoints in SNA controlled territory to be abandoned. For the remainder of the operation UNOSOM troops withdrew into entrenched positions and practically disappeared from Mogadishu streets. The Somali National Alliance and other factions retook full position of territory in the city that they had previously conceded.The next month on 16 November 1993, the United Nations Security Council instructed Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali to suspend arrest actions and declared the release of all Somali National Alliance prisoners of war. The following day Mohamed Farah Aidid announced that the decision had proved that the SNA had achieved a victory over the UN. After the cessation of hostilities between the SNA and UNOSOM, Acting Special Representative Lansana Kouyate (replacing Adm. Johnathan Howe) successfully launched an initiative to normalize relations in March 1994. Numerous points of contention between the respective organizations were discussed at length and understandings were reached, facilitating the normalization of the relationship between the UN and the SNA. That same year the UNOSOM II began withdrawing. The withdrawal of UNOSOM forces weakened Aidids prominence within the SNA, as the war had served to unify the alliance around a common foreign enemy.

=== Withdrawal and end of UNOSOM II ===
All US forces in Somalia completely withdrew on March 3, 1994. All European contingents also decided to withdraw at this time, leaving behind almost exclusively Third World forces to man UNOSOM II. Though it was widely feared the less equipped contingents came under attack from Somali militia following the Western withdrawal, the period was mostly uneventful. Local hostility forced the remaining UNOSOM staff in Somalia to travel by helicopter, even for distances as short as a kilometre. This was in stark contrast to the intervention&#x27;s onset when the UN personnel could travel via bus shuttle system.

On November 4, 1994, after peacemaking efforts by the remaining 1,900 UNOSOM II troops failed, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voted unanimously to withdraw all forces in Resolution 954. Subsequently, on November 16, the UNSC authorized Resolution 955, placing new emphasis on peacemaking and reconstruction and returning to a less reactive role. The withdrawal of the remaining UN military and police troops from Somalia was completed on March 28, 1995, thereby ending UNOSOM II&#x27;s mandate.

=== Casualties ===
UNOSOM II forces suffered a total of 385 casualties, including over 130 deaths. US forces suffered a total of 196 casualties during the operation, including 26 deaths. 7 Nigerian soldiers were killed during a skirmish with the SNA in September 1993. Estimates of total UNOSOM II personnel killed vary from 134 to 154 across the entire operation. 110 of the deaths are attributed to combat related fatalities. The vast majority, approximately 80, were killed in the course of the operations of 1993.

Although the operation&#x27;s casualties have been surpassed by the more recent MINUSMA operation in Mali, UNOSOM II was among the deadliest missions in UN history for peacekeepers. It stands out for having the highest number of deaths resulting from hostile actions compared to both earlier and subsequent operations.

6,000 to 10,000 Somalis had been estimated to have been killed or wounded during the operation, many as a result of helicopter gunship fire. According to American foreign correspondent Scott Peterson, Aidid personally told him a total of 13,000 Somalis had been killed by UNOSOM forces. In Peterson&#x27;s view, it was unlikely that Somali deaths during UNOSOM II surpassed 2,000. Peterson asserts that nearly two-thirds of the Somali casualties were women and children. According to SNA personnel, an estimated 900 fighters died in the war with UNOSOM, the most significant losses inflicted during the Battle of Mogadishu.

=== Results of 1994 UN Inquiry ===
The month following the Battle of Mogadishu, the United States urged the United Nations to establish the commission to determine who was responsible for the clashes between UNOSOM II peacekeepers and Aidid&#x27;s SNA forces. A three-man UN inquiry commission headed by Matthew Nglube, former chief justice of Zambia, Gen. Emmanuel Erskine of Ghana and Gen. Gustav Hagglund of Finland was set up by the Security Council. On 30 November 1993 the commission landed in Mogadishu.

The report charged the Gen. Aidid with launching the 5 June 1993, attack which initiated the conflict between the SNA and UNOSOM. Notably, it also heavily criticized U.N. peacekeeping officials for embarking on a campaign of forceful disarmament of Somali factions, an effort that antagonized the Aidid&#x27;s forces and sharpened tensions. The commission questioned the merit of the aggressive UNOSOM peacekeeping strategy and argued that the U.N. should not have abandoned its neutral role in Somalia. The inquiry criticized the United States for operating under a separate military command and leading raids against Aidid that were not coordinated with UNOSOM officers. The commission condemned the use of American combat helicopters over the heavily populated neighborhoods of Mogadishu and criticized tactics as &quot;incompatible with basic tenets of peacekeeping&quot;. The report recommended financial reparations for Somali civilians who became victims of the fighting.

== Criticism of UNOSOM II ==

=== Over emphasis on military operations ===
UNOSOM II was widely criticized for placing too much emphasis on military operations. Over 90% of the operations $1.6 billion budget was used for military or security purposes. In July 1993, UN relief head Jan Eliasson publicly admonished UNOSOM II for spending 10 times as much on military operations in Somalia than it did on aid. At the time he cautioned that the original objective of sending troops to Somalia was being forgotten. Due to the war with the Somali National Alliance and the insurgency, UNOSOM II would end up spending far more than the allocated $1.6 billion.

Ramesh Thakur, a former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, pointed out that the extent, intensity, and frequency of military force used by UNOSOM II after 5 June 1993, did not align with the principles and definition of a peacekeeping operation as defined by the United Nations. The day after the Battle of Mogadishu, after being asked by journalists on national news if Malaysia disagreed with any UNOSOM policies, Defence Minister Najib Razak commented: &quot;We find there is too much emphasis on military action, like it was an obsession.&quot; This led to accusations from some Somalia observers that UNOSOM was helping build up the myth of Aidid by depicting him as the only Somali capable of defying a foreign military presence.

=== Excessive force and human rights abuses ===
UNOSOM II forces were criticized for various instances of human rights abuses, violations of international law and excessive force by a wide range of academics, foreign correspondents and humanitarian organizations.&quot;&quot; Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International all criticized UNOSOM II on these grounds. Africa Rights Watch and Doctors Without Borders both published detailed reports of abuses by UN forces during the summer of 1993. While conceding UN troops were in a difficult position, the Africa Rights Watch report concluded that abuses and atrocities carried out by UNOSOM II force stemmed from the highest echelons of the command structure and were not cases of undisciplined actions by individual soldiers.&quot;&quot; According to de Waal, on several occasions UNOSOM forces in Mogadishu violated the Geneva Conventions. Among the forces responsible for human rights abuses were the United States, Italy, France, Nigeria and numerous other UNOSOM contingents.

Some of the most widely criticized events that occurred from 5 June to 3–4 October 1993 include:

* US forces fired missiles at Digfer Hospital in Mogadishu on the belief that Aidids forces were hiding in the buildings, resulting in the deaths of nine patients. Africa Rights Watch asserted that the incident represented a prima-facie case that UN command in Mogadishu had violated the Geneva Convention.
* Pakistani forces fired on two large public demonstrations killing over 20 Somalis, many of whom were women and children.
* US Quick Reaction Force launched the Abdi House raid during a meeting of Somali elders, resulting in the deaths of at least 60 civilians according to Amnesty International.
* Rony Brauman, who was then serving as the president of Doctors Without Borders, detailed an incident in which the premises of Action Against Hunger in Mogadishu, also housing the Doctors Without Borders team, came under attack by UNOSOM forces. Two U.S. AH-1 Cobra helicopters, disregarding the clearly visible Red Cross flags and emblems of both humanitarian organizations on the building, fired two missiles at the compound before strafing it with machine-gun fire, resulting in the death of one aid worker and injuries to several others. According to Brauman the incident was triggered by the presence of a vehicle nearby which the attack helicopters had deemed suspicious, but belonged to journalists from the France 2 television channel.
* In mid-September US AH-1 Cobra helicopters killed nearly 100 Somalis who were in the vicinity of a clash between the SNA and the 10th Mountain Division using TOW missiles and cannon fire. Children living in the surrounding neighborhood had also been killed by stray helicopter fire.
The UN&#x27;s response to these events were characterized by a marked lack of transparency and accountability. Despite possessing internal advice from its own legal and political staff in Somalia, UNOSOM reportedly disregard their input and criticism. Amnesty International described the UN&#x27;s internal investigatory mechanisms for dealing with human rights violations by its troops in Somalia as highly inadequate and inconsistent with the UN&#x27;s own standards. In the vast majority of incidents, no UN forces were ever reprimanded or punished.

=== Misleading claims and relationship with journalists ===
Former Under-Secretary-General Ramesh Thakur observed that UNOSOM II consistently undermined its authority by deceiving and misleading journalists. He noted that The Times correspondents in Mogadishu could recall numerous occasions where UNOSOM officials had lied to reporters. According to BBC journalist Mark Doyle, reporters in Mogadishu often treated the versions of events purported by UNOSOM with as much skepticism as those purported by Aidid. Doyle claimed that information given out by UN officials was sometimes deliberately misleading. Reuters Mogadishu correspondent Aidan Hartley noted that UNOSOM officials, &quot;...toed a line of propaganda that was palpably absurd to reporters who went around and saw what was happening.&quot;

In an incident noted by both Aidan Hartley and Ramesh Thakur, an American AH-1 Cobra helicopter fire a missile into Mogadishu in view of a large crowd of Somalis and foreign correspondents. Witnesses watched and had filmed a TOW missile leave the helicopter and spiral into a tea shop, killing a Somali woman. A press conference was held after, during which the UNOSOM spokesman flatly denied the eyewitness accounts and claimed that no helicopters had launched any attack. Following the denial, a TV cameraman got up and played the tape he had filmed of the helicopter firing the missile. UNOSOM only admitted responsibility after footage of the attack was later broadcast globally. In another significant incident, Pakistani UNOSOM troops opened fire with a machine gun onto a crowd of protesters. Thousands of Somalis citizens and dozens foreign journalists had witnessed the troops open fire, unprovoked, from a rooftop emplacement resulting in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women and children. UNOSOM claimed that Somali National Alliance militia had used the crowd as human shields to fire on the Pakistanis, who then shot back in self defence. According to The Washington Post, the UNOSOM account of the shooting was disputed by virtually all witnesses.

According to American war correspondent Scott Peterson, US forces had censored images of mortars firing from UN bases directly into the city of Mogadishu by confiscating the pictures and arresting the photojournalist who had taken the image. In another incident, Associated Press photographer Peter Northall was photographing an American UH-60 Black Hawk purposely &quot;rotor washing&quot; a market in the city, only to then be directly targeted and assaulted with six percussion grenades from the helicopter. UNOSOM II press spokesman, US Maj. David Stockwell, defended the incident stating that Northall posed &quot;a threat to himself&quot;.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
UNOSOM II is widely regarded as unsuccessful in achieving its main objectives and having ended in failure, largely due to the decision to withdraw without completing its goals following the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993. According to Alex de Waal, the failure of the operation can only be understood, &quot;...in the context of the routine brutality and impunity of many of the military contingents, which antagonized Somalis who would have otherwise been supportive.&quot; A 1995 Amnesty International report concluded that the operation had demonstrated a poor record of promoting and protecting human rights, which consequently severely impede its ability to function.

UNOSOM II’s complete departure in early 1995 did not result in the eruption of violence that was widely predicted, though the civil war continued to simmer with occasional clashes between factions. The withdrawal led to the formation of local administrations gaining momentum throughout Somalia, such as localized Islamic Courts and regional administrations like Puntland, resulting in period of relative stability and economic growth until the early 2000&#x27;s. Somali political science professor Hussein Adam notes, &quot;With the collapse of UNOSOM-sponsored institutions, more authentic entities, including authoritative local leaders, have emerged. With the distorting effect of UNOSOM no longer present, the process of both political and economic transformation has been facilitated. In certain places, including northern Mogadishu, alternative institutions have emerged without any external support.&quot;

In the view of Walter Clarke, a high ranking US official involved in Operation Restore Hope, and Jeffrey Herbst, Associate Professor at Princeton University, &quot;&quot;&quot;The intervention in Somalia was not an abject failure; an estimated 100,000 lives were saved. But its mismanagement should be an object lesson for peacekeepers...on other such missions.&quot; The figure of Somalis saved following the large scale military intervention in December 1992 is disputed by various other academics and organizations. According to an assessment by the Washington based independent NGO Refugee Policy Group, only 10,000 to 25,000 lives of the approximately 100,000 rescued by international assistance had been saved by the UNITAF and UNOSOM II interventions, though de Waal argues the true figure of lives saved may have been even lower.

Charles W. Maynes, an American diplomat and editor of Foreign Policy, reported that according to private estimates by CIA officials, U.S. troops alone may have been responsible for between 7,000 and 10,000 Somali casualties. Mohamed Sahnoun, former Special Representative of the Secretary General to Somalia claimed 6,000 to 10,000 Somalis had been killed in the war with UNOSOM forces. This has led to debates about the net impact of UNOSOM II.

In Somali culture, the era has become the subject of numerous plays and poetry. As noted by Dr. Ana Ljubinkovic, these works often take the form of sophisticated dramas, showcasing a critical perspective of UNOSOM&#x27;s perceived arrogance and misjudgments.

<text>.vc is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Registration is open worldwide, and it has been used for a variety of sites not necessarily related to that location; it can also be seen as standing for &quot;venture capital&quot;, &quot;Ventura County&quot;, &quot;version control&quot;, &quot;video conferencing&quot;, or other things, like an informal, but common, abbreviation of &quot;você&quot; (, in Portuguese). In this way, &quot;.com.vc&quot; could be understood in Portuguese like &quot;.with.you&quot; would be in English. .vc is sometimes mistaken for being the ccTLD of the Vatican City State, which is .va.

On October 31, 2000, the .vc registry operations contract was awarded to Tucows by the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Tucows serviced .vc through their wholly-owned subsidiary Liberty RMS. On March 25, 2002, Afilias acquired Liberty RMS from Tucows, and the binding registry operations contract for the .vc ccTLD was assigned to Afilias by Tucows.

<text>Sterling Forest, New York is a hamlet in the Town of Warwick, Orange County. It is served by an active United States post office of the same name. It is situated on the eastern shore of Greenwood Lake, at the New Jersey state line. Part of the hamlet extends into West Milford Township, Passaic County, New Jersey. The hamlet grew up around the terminal station of the Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway, later called the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, and later the Greenwood Lake division of the Erie Railroad. The railroad reached this point around 1875, with the station located at the state line in New Jersey. The depot complex originally contained the Sterling Forest, New Jersey post office. The post office was moved to the New York side of the line in 1926, where it continues to operate. Rail service ceased in 1935.

The coming of the railroad was preceded by the construction of a large commercial ice house by the Ringwood Company around 1864. The Sterling Forest ice house was later operated by the Mountain Ice Company of Hoboken, New Jersey. It ceased operation and was eventually torn down in 1945.

At one time, the hamlet also boasted two hotels (one in New Jersey), a general store, lumber yard, two bars (in addition to those in the hotels) and a Roman Catholic church (in New Jersey). Today, the only businesses that remain are one bar/restaurant, and a marina (on the site of the depot).

In the 1930s and 1940s, Yankee great Babe Ruth often rented a cabin in the hamlet for the summer, and was known to play baseball with the local neighborhood children at a small ballfield located there.

It was the site of the first American rocket airplane flight that carried mail from the New York side of the state line to the New Jersey side on February 23, 1936.

Often confused with Sterling Forest, New York is the old Sterling Forest Gardens property and the adjacent Sterling Forest State Park, both located several miles away in the Town of Tuxedo, New York. The property is now the site of the New York Renaissance Faire, an annual Renaissance fair. Adding to the confusion, there is another fair called The Sterling Renaissance Festival which is located north of Syracuse, NY.

<text>.vg is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the British Virgin Islands. Because it allows registration at the second level, and does not require the registrant to be associated with the British Virgin Islands, it has also been used by piracy related websites such as The Pirate Bay, and video gaming related blogs and websites.

==March 2013 dispute over ownership of the .vg, .tc, and .gd registries==

In March 2013 domain name registrars such as GoDaddy stopped accepting new registrations for .vg, .gd, and .tc domain names. This is the result of a dispute over the ownership and control of AdamsNames Ltd., which had been the accredited registry by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for those top level domains. A former partner of AdamsNames Ltd. created a new company, Meridian TLD, which claimed to be the new accredited registry.

On 10 April 2014, the zone was re-delegated by IANA to KSregistry. The sponsoring organization was re-delegated to The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Virgin Islands (TRC). All changes that were made in the .vg zone after 8 March 2013 were lost as Meridian TLD did not cooperate by giving the zone file to KSregistry. After the re-delegation there was a one-month window where KSregistry-accredited registrars would be able to update, renew, or delete domain names from 15 April 2014, 10:00 UTC to 11 May 2014, 23:59 UTC. After 12 May 2014, 10:00 UTC, KSregistry would allow new domains to be registered.

<doc id="1113727" wikidata="Q6652328" url="?curid=1113727" title="Little Traverse Bay">
<text>Little Traverse Bay ( ) is a small open bay of Lake Michigan. Extending about into the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, much of the head of the land surrounding Little Traverse Bay, and has become part of the urban areas of Petoskey and Harbor Springs. Little Traverse Bay primarily lies within Emmet County, although a small portion lies within Charlevoix County.

== Overview ==
Harbor Springs, a settlement on the bay, originated as &quot;L&#x27;arbre de Croche,&quot; (Crooked Tree) a French Jesuit mission village to serve the Odawa people bands in the area. After the British took over the territory, the village was renamed in English. The federally recognized Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians have their headquarters here. They have land here, and additional land and a gaming casino in Petoskey.

The Little Traverse Light marks the entrance at Harbor Springs to the smaller harbor within the bay.

After the Odawa bands in northern Michigan were persuaded to cede considerable lands to the United States, the Little Traverse Bay region was developed by Illinois land developers and resort founders, such as lawyers Henry Stryker III and Henry Brigham McClure, and the Capps family of Jacksonville, Illinois and woolen mills fame. The Stryker, Capps, and McClure families were interconnected with the Jacob Bunn industrial dynasty of Chicago and Springfield, Illinois.

The bay has also been used as a refuge by Great Lakes freighters during severe weather.

== Settlements ==

* Bay Shore
* Bay View
* Forest Beach
* Harbor Springs
* Harbor Point
* Petoskey
* Wequetonsing

== Recreation ==
The bay has significant publicly accessible parkland on the waterfront, including in the cities of Petoskey and Harbor Springs, and in Petoskey State Park.

Little Traverse Bay is popular during the summer for boating, sailing and swimming by the numerous vacation communities on the bay, including Bay View, Wequetonsing, and Harbor Point. Many of these communities also provide sailing and swimming lessons.

The bay is the location of the annual Ugotta Regatta, hosted by the Little Traverse Yacht Club in Harbor Springs. Participants are often boat owners and crews who have sailed in the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac and Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race, each held on one of the two weekends before.

<doc id="1113731" wikidata="Q129933" url="?curid=1113731" title="Prasada">
<text>Prasāda (, Sanskrit: प्रसाद), prasad or prasadam is a religious offering in Hinduism. Most often &quot;Prasada&quot; is vegetarian food especially cooked for devotees after praise and thanksgiving to a god. &quot;Mahaprasada&quot; (also called &quot;bhandarā&quot;), is the consecrated food offered to the deity in a Hindu temple which is then distributed and partaken by all the devotees regardless of any orientation.

&quot;Prasada&quot; is closely linked to the term &quot;naivedya&quot;, also spelt &quot;naivedhya&quot;, &quot;naibedya&quot; or naived(h)yam. The food offered to the deity is called &quot;naivedya&quot;, while the sacred food sanctified and returned by the deity as a blessing is called &quot;prasada&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Prasāda&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;prasād&quot; which consists of the verb सद् (&quot;sad&quot; - to sit, dwell) which is prefixed with प्र (&quot;pra&quot; - before, afore, in front) and used as finite verb प्रसीदति (&quot;prasīdati&quot; - dwells, presides, pleases or favours etc.). It denotes anything, typically food, that is first offered to a deity or saint and then distributed in His or Her name to their followers or others as a good sign.

&#x27;Prasāda&#x27; is sometimes translated as gift or grace.

==Practices==
The &quot;prasada&quot; is to be consumed by attendees as a holy offering. The offerings may include cooked food, fruits and confectionery sweets. Vegetarian food is usually offered and later distributed to the devotees who are present in the temple. Sometimes this vegetarian offering will exclude prohibited items such as garlic, onion, mushroom, etc.

Non-vegetarian is prohibited in some of the temples. Offering of food items forms part of the &quot;upachara&quot; or services to a Hindu deity in many Hindu traditions but is not universal. The &quot;murti&quot; (icon) is revered as a living entity who is offered food, fruits, and betelnut among others. 
This can be considered to be a symbolic rather than a literal offering.

Tasting during preparation or eating the &quot;naivedya&quot; food before offering it to the god is strictly forbidden.

In its material sense, &quot;prasada&quot; is created by a process of giving and receiving between a human devotee and the god. For example, a devotee makes an offering of a material substance such as flowers, fruits, or sweets. The deity then &#x27;enjoys&#x27; or tastes a bit of the offering. This now-divinely invested substance is called &quot;prasada&quot; and is received by the devotee to be ingested, worn, etc. It may be the same material that was originally offered or material offered by others and then re-distributed to other devotees. In many temples, several kinds of &quot;prasada&quot; (e.g., nuts, sweets) are distributed to the devotees. 

Offering food and subsequently receiving &quot;prasada&quot; is central to the practice of &quot;puja.&quot; Any food that is offered either physically to the image of the god or silently in prayer is considered &quot;prasada&quot;.

In Sikhism, karah parshad is served to the congregation after prayer and reading of scripture. Parshad represents the same values as langar in that it is served indiscriminately.

Kurukshetra Prasadam (Channa laddu) in 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra, Tirupati Laddu and Mathura peda in the Braj Parikrama are geo-specialty prasada.

<text>.vn is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Vietnam.

The domain name registry for .vn is the Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC).

Currently, the national domain name server system of Vietnam consists of seven server clusters. Among these, five clusters are located domestically, and two clusters are located in other countries, with more than 70 points in major cities around the world where there is a high density of .vn domain queries and a significant Vietnamese community.

.vn domain names with 1 or 2 characters are registered through an auction.

There are 43 1-character .vn domain names, including: 36 domain names with a plain ASCII character (a, b, c, .. .x, y, z, 0, 1, 2, 3, .. 7, 8, 9.vn) and 7 domain names with a Vietnam-specific character (â, ă, đ, ê, ô, ơ, ư.vn). There are 1296 2-character domain names with a combination of ASCII characters (a0, a1, a2, ..., z7, z8, z9.vn).

== History ==

In 1994, Rob Hurle was one of the first to think of and be authorized to register the .vn domain for Vietnam, replacing the .au (Australia) domain. VNPT managed the DNS server and the .vn domain.

In 2000, VNPT transferred the DNS server and the .vn domain to the Vietnam Internet Network Information Center (VNNIC) when this center was established by the Vietnamese government.

In 2003, Dot VN, Inc. signed an agreement with VNNIC allowing the company to market the .vn domain overseas.

==Second-level domains==
The .vn domain name may be registered as a ccTLD or country code second-level domain (ccSLD). Below is a list of ccSLDs under the .vn domain name.

<doc id="1113735" wikidata="Q1438618" url="?curid=1113735" title="Fort McClary">
<text>Fort McClary is a former defensive fortification of the United States military located along the southern coast at Kittery Point, Maine at the mouth of the Piscataqua River. It was used throughout the 19th century to protect approaches to the harbor of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery. The property and its surviving structures are now owned and operated by the State of Maine as Fort McClary State Historic Site, including a blockhouse dating from 1844.

==History==
===Colonial period===
Coastal defenses on the site date to the late 17th century when shipbuilder William Pepperell (father of William Pepperrell) acquired the property and erected crude defense works in 1689. Prior to that, the village was protected by Fort William and Mary at New Castle. The Province of Massachusetts Bay voted in 1715 to erect a permanent breastwork of six guns for the defense of the Piscataqua River, during the lead-up to Father Rale&#x27;s War. Some sources state that it was intended to protect Maine (then part of Massachusetts) from &quot;unreasonable duties&quot; (taxes) that the governor of New Hampshire was attempting to impose on nearby citizens of other colonies. The fort was also used to collect duties from Massachusetts citizens for its own upkeep. This fortification was transferred to the United States government in 1803, known as Fort William, but none of its features are known to survive.

The Pepperrells remained loyal to the British in 1775, so their property was confiscated by local Patriot forces, including the fort. In 1776, ammunition was provided for the fort&#x27;s 9-pounder and 12-pounder cannon, and the New Hampshire militia manned the fort until 1779.

===Second system period===
Fort McClary was officially established in 1808 as part of the second system of US fortifications. It was named for New Hampshire native Major Andrew McClary, an American officer killed in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. It consisted of a semi-elliptical lower battery of 9 or 10 guns and a shot furnace, and an upper battery near the present blockhouse whose armament does not appear in references. The fort was used throughout the 19th century, most notably during the War of 1812, but it saw no action.

===Third system and Civil War===
The fort was further expanded in the 1840s, probably a consequence of tensions with Great Britain over the disputed border between Maine and New Brunswick which culminated in the bloodless Aroostook War and the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty. The blockhouse was built in 1844 near the former upper battery; this was the last blockhouse built at a fort in Maine, and probably one of the last in a US coastal fort. The fort saw active use during the American Civil War, at which time it achieved much of its present structure due to a rebuilding under the third system that was never completed. The fort was manned near the start of the war by the Maine Coast Guard and the Kittery Artillery company, and in 1864 was also manned by the Maine State Guard. Its Civil War garrison notably included Vice President Hannibal Hamlin, who enlisted in Company A of the Maine State Guard as a private and served as a cook in the fort. Some subsequent citations erroneously confuse his unit with the Maine Coast Guard — including a plaque at the fort. 

The fort saw little action during the Civil War. A major rebuilding and expansion began in 1863 as part of the third system of fortifications, and the intent was to create a large five-sided fort with one or two tiers of cannon all around. However, only the seawalls were completed on the two seaward fronts, along with one of the landward cannon bastions with a granite magazine. The seawall was defended by a small caponier with rifle ports. Based on war experience, masonry forts were assessed as vulnerable to rifled cannon, and funding was withdrawn from all masonry fort projects in 1867, leaving Fort McClary with few cannon positions. A large number of granite blocks remain at the fort to this day.

===Post Civil War to present===

In the 1870s, the lower battery was rebuilt with three temporary gun positions for 10-inch Parrott rifles, but funding was again cut off with few other improvements. In the 1890s, nine 15-inch Rodman smoothbore guns and seven carriages were stored at the fort, to be mounted in case of war. Three of the Rodmans were mounted as an emergency measure in the Spanish–American War of 1898. The fort was superseded by the construction of Fort Foster (Kittery, Maine) and new batteries at Fort Constitution under the Endicott Program by 1901. By the 1910s, most of the fort had fallen into disrepair and it was officially decommissioned in 1918. The State of Maine acquired most of the property from the federal government in 1924, after which it was managed as a park. Several of the dilapidated structures were demolished in the following decades. Parts of the fort were used by civilian defense forces during World War II. In 1969, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The blockhouse and other structures were renovated in 1987, and the blockhouse serves as a museum.

<doc id="1113742" wikidata="Q6966890" url="?curid=1113742" title="Nashotah House">
<text>Nashotah House is an Anglican seminary in Nashotah, Wisconsin. The seminary opened in 1842 and received its official charter in 1847. The institution is independent and generally regarded as one of the more theologically conservative seminaries in the Episcopal Church. It is also officially recognized by the Anglican Church in North America.

Nashotah House is the oldest institution of higher learning in Wisconsin. Its campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.
==History==
Nashotah House was founded in 1842 by three young deacons of The Episcopal Church (TEC): James Lloyd Breck, William Adams, and John Henry Hobart, Jr., who were all recent graduates of the General Theological Seminary in New York City. Bishop Jackson Kemper had asked them to undertake this task. Gustaf Unonius was the first graduate.

=== Theological tradition ===
Nashotah House was, from the beginning, a center for High Church thought and discipline. Breck served as the first dean, and was highly committed to the principles of the Oxford Movement, which in part revived liturgical practices. Later, noted professors such as James DeKoven would bring Anglo-Catholic worship and practice to the seminary. It included daily celebration of the Eucharist and the liturgical use of vestments, candles, and incense.

Nashotah identifies as being within the orthodox Anglo-Catholic tradition. Overall, the faculty support traditional theology and conceptions of Christian doctrine, in opposition to liberal theologies. Historically, the school had a reputation for admitting only high-church seminarians, although the school has sought to broaden its appeal to other forms of churchmanship. Nonetheless, as of 2023, Nashotah House was the only seminary affiliated with the Episcopal Church that does not admit students who have entered into same-sex marriages.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, Nashotah House has dealt with various challenges associated with the 2009 split within The Episcopal Church, during which several theologically conservative parishes broke away to form the Anglican Church in North America. Unlike Trinity Anglican Seminary, which disaffiliated from TEC in 2022, Nashotah House remains affiliated with TEC, although it educates students from the Anglican Communion as a whole. In 2023, 45% of seminarians were affiliated with TEC, 45% were affiliated with ACNA, and 10% were affiliated with other denominations. TEC students outnumber ACNA students in the residential M.Div. program.

Robert Munday led Nashotah House from 2001 to 2011. He enjoyed the longest tenure for a dean in school history, but was criticized for what some called his &quot;overly sympathetic&quot; attitude towards the ACNA.

Dean-Bishop Edward L. Salmon Jr. led the seminary from 2011 to 2015 with the goal of improving the seminary&#x27;s relationship with TEC, particularly the Diocese of Milwaukee. In February 2014, Salmon invited the liberal TEC Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori to preach at the school. Jefferts Schori had previously sought to steer away prospective students from Nashotah House. The decision was condemned by the seminary&#x27;s largely conservative supporters, including ex-Dean Munday, who cited Jefferts Schori&#x27;s policy of suing breakaway ACNA parishes to keep their resources within TEC, as well as what they considered her heretical views. Two bishops who were members of the Nashotah House Board of Trustees resigned or distanced themselves from the school; one of the bishops&#x27; dioceses had been sued by Jefferts Schori after joining the ACNA.

Salmon stepped down in 2015, although the chairman of the board stated that the resignation was &quot;pre-planned&quot; and not related to the Jefferts Schori controversy. He was succeeded by Steven Peay, who retired in 2017 citing health issues and other personal factors. During the mid-2010s, enrollment dipped significantly, falling from 110 full-time students (143 total) in 2012-13 to 52 full-time equivalent students in 2017.

Under Garwood Anderson (d. 2017-24), who made efforts to recruit ACNA members and low church adherents as seminarians, full-time equivalent enrollment rebounded from 52 to 119. Anderson stepped down and returned to the classroom in 2024. He was succeeded by religious historian Lauren Whitnah, the first woman to lead the seminary in 182 years, and a member of an ACNA congregation.

The seminary typically runs at a deficit, and the endowment stood at $10-11 million in 2023; it was $10 million in 2011.

==Academics==
Nashotah House offers degree and certificate programs aimed at training clergy and lay leaders for ministries in the Anglican Communion:

*Doctor of Ministry (DMin)
*Master of Sacred Theology (STM)
*Master of Divinity (MDiv) 
*Master of Pastoral Ministry (MPM)
*Master of Theological Studies (MTS) 
*Master of Ministry (MM)
*Master of Sacred Music (MSM)

It also offers a one-year certificate program in Anglican studies, geared toward students who have received an M.Div. from a non-Anglican institution and wish to be ordained within the Anglican tradition. The Master of Pastoral Ministry and the Master of Ministry degree may be earned through a combination of residential and online study.

The DMin, STM, MDiv, MPM, MTS, MM and MSM degrees are accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

==Campus==

The property of the Nashotah House Theological Seminary covers 365 acres (148 ha) of land.

The main buildings of the seminary include, from oldest:
*Chapel of St. Mary the Virgin, designed by James Douglas in Gothic Revival style and built in 1862.
*Webb Hall (faculty and guest housing, the Chapel of Saints Peter and Paul), Gothic Revival style, built 1865 and added to in 1926 and 1950.
*Shelton Hall (student housing), Gothic Revival style, built in 1869. Photo in box above.
*Sabine Hall (faculty offices, student housing), designed by Alexander Eschweiler in Gothic Revival style, built in 1892, and expanded in 1910.
*Lewis Hall (administration and faculty offices, the Saint Francis Oratory), designed by Eschweiler in Gothic Revival style and built in 1892.
*Frances Donaldson Memorial Library, designed by John B. Sutcliffe in Collegiate Gothic style, built in 1911, and expanded in 1982.
*Kemper Hall (classrooms, student housing, gymnasium), designed by Eschweiler &amp; Eschweiler in Neogothic Revival style and built in 1956.
*James Lloyd Breck Refectory, designed by Eschweiler &amp; Eschweiler and built in 1965.

There are also apartments for both single and married students, and several houses for the dean and other faculty, as well as maintenance facilities.

Construction has been completed on a substantial addition to the refectory. The newly dubbed Adams Hall includes a large meeting hall and additional classrooms.

==Student life==

Nashotah began as a community inspired by traditional monastic life of prayer, work, and study. James Lloyd Breck&#x27;s vision was to create a center for Christian formation in the (then) wilderness that would also be movement to propagate other communities for the purpose of evangelizing the frontier. Today, much of this vision remains intact and students still live a Benedictine cycle of prayer, work, and study. The life of the Seminary seeks to form the character of priests and leaders into the image of Christ. Various students have been involved in mission work around the Anglican Communion as well.

&quot;Seminarians are invited to participate in an ascetic, disciplined, prayerful season of spiritual growth in Christ&quot; in which they &quot;practice the Benedictine Rule of daily prayer, labor, and study.&quot; All students have work crew assignments - cleaning bathrooms, mowing lawns, sweeping floors and taking other chores. Daily routine includes Morning Prayer, Mass, breakfast, classes, lunch, and Solemn Evensong. Always anticipated on the campus is the annual
St. Laurence Cup, a flag football game played against students from Sacred Heart School of Theology and St. Francis Seminary (Wisconsin). The formerly annual Lavabo Bowl game was played against Seabury-Western Theological Seminary which stopped granting residential Master of Divinity degrees in 2010 after ceasing to accept new M.Div. seminarians in 2008

<text>The Clackamas Indians are a band of Chinook of Native Americans who historically lived along the Clackamas River in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. 

Today, Clackamas people are enrolled in the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon.

In 1806, Lewis and Clark estimated their population to be 1,800. At the time the tribe lived in 12 villages located from the lower Columbia River to an area what is now called Oregon City. They resided towards the east side of the Willamette River. In February 1841, Reverend François Norbert Blanchet and Reverend Alvin F. Waller converted Clackamas Chief Popoh.

The Clackamas signed a treaty in the fall of 1851, which Oregon Superintendent Anson Dart failed to ratify. They signed another treaty on January 10, 1855, which was ratified on March 3, 1855. The Clackamas were promised $2,500 worth of resources, but the United States only paid a fifth of what was owed.

== Lifestyle ==

The tribe subsisted on fish and root vegetables, and constructed large cedar platforms to dip their nets in over Willamette Falls to harvest salmon. The Clackamas women dried and smoked the salmon, which they then combined with mixtures of berries and nuts, preserving it in woven baskets for winter. The Clackamas traded salmon with other tribes, and also harvested and traded &quot;wapato&quot;, broad-leafed arrowhead or &quot;Indian potato&quot; (&quot;Sagittaria latifolia&quot; and &quot;Sagittaria cuneata&quot;).

Adult Clackamas historically wore leather leggings and tunics, and made skirts and bedding from cedar bark. An indication of high status in the tribe was intricate beadwork, quillwork, feather, and shell decorations. Certain shells served as currency. 

Like others of the Chinookan peoples, Clackamas practiced head flattening. From infancy, one&#x27;s head was compressed between boards thus sloping the forehead backward. This was a way to indicate that a person was free rather than a slave.

The Clackamas were expert woodworkers, and crafted canoes and plank lodges. A typical canoe was 20 to 30 feet long, which they used to travel along the rivers, transporting trade goods and people. With deep knowledge of the Clackamas river systems, the Clackamas were often hired by pioneers as guides to navigate the river systems.

== Tomanowos ==
The Willamette Meteorite is culturally significant to Clackamas people. The meteorite is called &quot;Tomanowos&quot;, which translates to &quot;the visitor of heaven&quot;. The meteorite was believed to be given from the Sky People and is the unity between sky, earth, and water. Other tribes around the area thought that the meteorite possessed magical powers.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
By 1855, the 88 surviving members of the tribe were relocated to Grand Ronde, Oregon, first to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation. They eventually blended in the general population of the Grand Ronde.

Soosap, likely born in 1841, is considered to be the last full-blooded tribal member. His mother was full-blooded Clackamas, his father was Klickitat. Soosap lived off the Grand Ronde reservation in Oregon City, where he was a day laborer. His English name was Joseph Andrews as non-Native people couldn&#x27;t pronounce his Native name. He was also a known baseball player in the Pacific Northwest.

<doc id="1113760" wikidata="Q40656" url="?curid=1113760" title=".ua">
<text>.ua is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Ukraine. To register at the second-level (example) domainname.ua, possession of the exact trademark (matching the domain name) is required. It is not required for third-level domains (.com.ua, .net.ua, etc.).

==History==
* 1 December 1992: Registered in root zone
* 13 April 2012: DNSSEC enabled in root zone
* 26 February 2022: Domain servers transferred out of Kyiv for continuity reasons amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

== Third-level &amp; second-level domains ==

To remove the risk of cybersquatting, registration of second-level domains directly below .ua is restricted to owners of registered trade marks, who may register a domain name similar to that of the trade mark in question. 

However, third-level domains can be registered beneath some of the following:

=== Generic domains ===
* .com.ua: paid, commercial organizations
* .in.ua: paid, domains for individuals
* .org.ua: paid, other organizations (non-commercial)
* .net.ua: paid, network service providers

=== Special domains ===
* .edu.ua: free, available only to proved educational organisations.
* .gov.ua: free, available only to governmental organizations
* .mil.ua: free, available only to armed forces
* .dod.ua

=== Geographical domains ===
There are also second-level domains which are region-specific. These are less popular than the above list (making domain names more available) but they are sometimes restricted to organisations exclusively from within the region.
* .cherkasy.ua, .cherkassy.ua, .ck.ua: Cherkasy Oblast
* .chernihiv.ua, .chernigov.ua, .cn.ua: Chernihiv Oblast
* .chernivtsi.ua, .chernovtsy.ua, .cv.ua: Chernivtsi Oblast
* .crimea.ua, .sebastopol.ua, .yalta.ua: Crimea, Sevastopol, Yalta
* .dnipropetrovsk.ua, .dnepropetrovsk.ua, .dp.ua: Dnipropetrovsk Oblast
* .donetsk.ua, .dn.ua: Donetsk Oblast
* .ivano-frankivsk.ua, .if.ua: Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast
* .kharkiv.ua, .kharkov.ua, .kh.ua: Kharkiv Oblast
* .kherson.ua, .ks.ua: Kherson Oblast
* .khmelnytskyi.ua, .khmelnitskiy.ua, .km.ua: Khmelnytskyi Oblast
* .kropyvnytskyi.ua, .kirovograd.ua, .kr.ua: Kirovohrad Oblast
* .kyiv.ua, .kiev.ua: Kyiv
* .luhansk, .lugansk.ua, .lg.ua: Luhansk Oblast
* .lutsk.ua, .volyn.ua, .lt.ua: Lutsk, Volyn Oblast
* .lviv.ua: Lviv Oblast
* .mykolaiv.ua, .nikolaev.ua, .mk.ua: Mykolaiv Oblast
* .odesa.ua, .odessa.ua, .od.ua: Odesa Oblast
* .poltava.ua, .pl.ua: Poltava Oblast
* .rivne.ua, .rovno.ua, .rv.ua: Rivne Oblast
* .sumy.ua, .sm.ua: Sumy Oblast
* .ternopil.ua, .te.ua: Ternopil Oblast
* .uzhhorod.ua, .uzhgorod.ua, .uz.ua, zakarpattia.ua: Uzhhorod
* .vinnytsia.ua, .vinnica.ua, .vn.ua: Vinnytsia Oblast
* .zaporizhzhia.ua, .zaporizhzhe.ua, .zp.ua: Zaporizhzhia Oblast
* .zhytomyr.ua, .zhitomir.ua, .zt.ua: Zhytomyr Oblast

=== Mirror domains ===
When registering a domain name in one of the mirror domains, a domain name of the same name in the second (other) mirror domain will automatically be reserved for the registrant.

* cherkasy.ua — cherkassy.ua: Cherkasy Oblast
* chernihiv.ua — chernigov.ua: Chernihiv Oblast
* chernivtsi.ua — chernovtsy.ua: Chernivtsi Oblast
* khmelnytskyi.ua — khmelnitskiy.ua: Khmelnytskyi Oblast
* kropyvnytskyi.ua — kirovograd.ua: Kirovohrad Oblast
* kyiv.ua — kiev.ua: Kyiv
* luhansk.ua — lugansk.ua: Luhansk Oblast
* mykolaiv.ua — nikolaev.ua — mk.ua: Mykolaiv Oblast
* odesa.ua — odessa.ua — od.ua: Odesa Oblast
* rivne.ua — rovno.ua: Rivne Oblast
* uzhhorod.ua — uzhgorod.ua: Uzhhorod
* vinnytsia.ua — vinnica.ua: Vinnytsia Oblast
* zaporizhzhia.ua — zaporizhzhe.ua: Zaporizhzhia Oblast
* zhytomyr.ua — zhitomir.ua: Zhytomyr Oblast

=== Geographic domains where new registrations have been terminated ===

* chernovtsy.ua: Chernivtsi Oblast
* chernigov.ua: Chernihiv Oblast
* dnepropetrovsk.ua: Dnipropetrovsk Oblast
* dnipropetrovsk.ua: Dnipropetrovsk Oblast
* kirovograd.ua: Kirovohrad Oblast
* khmelnitskiy.ua: Khmelnytskyi Oblast
* rovno.ua: Rivne Oblast

=== Reserved domain names ===
The administrators of the .UA ccTLD have decided to reserve public domains with transliterations of Ukrainian names for most Ukrainian geographical domains. Geographical public domains, initially based on phone area codes, were allocated during a conference of Ukrainian internet specialists in Slavsko in January 1993, following the delegation of the .UA country code top-level domain. Initially, these domains were mostly transliterations of Russian city names (e.g., kiev.ua, kirovograd.ua, sebastopol.ua). As the Internet transitioned from experimental to mainstream technology, new requirements and discussions for alternative names emerged. In December 1997, shorter, easier-to-remember two-letter names were introduced (e.g., ivano-frankivsk.ua became if.ua). The introduction of these new names aimed to address inherent flaws without replacing old names, allowing parallel registration in both traditional and new domains. These changes, led by domain administrators Dmytro Kohmanyuk, Ihor Svyrydon, and Hostmaster LLC, will ensure Ukrainian transliterations are reserved and mirrored to existing geographical domains, available to administrators by autumn 2008, contingent on compliance with .UA domain rules.
* .cr.ua: Crimea
* .krym.ua: Crimea
* .kv.ua: Kyiv
* .lv.ua: Lviv Oblast
* .sb.ua: Sevastopol
* .sevastopol.ua: Sevastopol
* .sicheslav.ua: Dnipropetrovsk Oblast

=== Technological domains ===
* admin.ua
* ipv6.ua
* ns.ua
* ua.ua
* www.ua
* xn--mqa.ua
* dnssec.ua
* rdap.ua
* epp1.ua
* epp2.ua

== Statistics ==
As of March 2017, around 10.78% of all the .ua domains were served via secured HTTPS protocol, with the Let&#x27;s Encrypt Authority X3 being the most popular SSL certificate. Nginx is the most popular web server, serving 68.97% of the .ua domains, followed by Apache serving 17.75% of the total .ua domains.

<text>.ug is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Uganda.

==Second-level domains==

Registrations were traditionally made under these second-level subdomains:

* .co.ug – Commercial entities
* .ac.ug – Educational Institution offering diplomas, degrees and higher academic awards
* .sc.ug – Primary, secondary and lower educational branches
* .go.ug – Government Agencies and independent authorities under government
* .ne.ug – Network providers or special equipment for network provision
* .or.ug – Non governmental institutions
* .org.ug – Non governmental institutions
* .com.ug – Commercial entities
* .med.ug – Medical entities or health institutions
* .ngo.ug – Non governmental organizations in Uganda
* .law.ug – Legal firms and practitioners in Uganda
* .ltd.ug – Commercial companies and business entities in Uganda (public or private limited companies)
* .inc.ug – Commercial companies and business entities in Uganda (corporations)

== Disputes over administration ==
In 2014, Ugandan Members of Parliament called for an investigation after a revelation that a private firm, Infinity Computers and Communication Company (i3c, formerly known as Computer Frontiers), owned Uganda&#x27;s top-level Internet domain. During a Finance Committee the MPs pressed ICT minister John Nasasira to explain how the private company came to own the domain, which could endanger national security.

The MPs resolved to contact the registrar of companies to furnish them with the details of the proprietors of i3c and asked the minister to explain the circumstances under which the company took over the domain.

Unlike countries like China which put restrictions on the domain purchasing process, Uganda ccTLD managers don&#x27;t put any restriction on who can register domain names.

<text>.uz is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Uzbekistan. Registry services were formerly operated by Euracom GmBH, but were later redelegated to UZINFOCOM. Registrations are taken directly at the second level, but the former registry also advertised the availability of registrations at the third level beneath co.uz and com.uz, and some domain names under other second-level names such as org.uz also exist.

In Latvia, .uz is used as short-link address — ej.uz, which means &quot;go to&quot;.

.uz has an A record and had a HTTP server since at least 1997.
== Second-level domains ==
The table of second-level domains of the .uz domain zone, terms of use, requirements, regulated users, domain categories.
== History ==
The top-level domain .UZ was first created and delegated on April 29, 1995 by the IANA-based University of the Informatics Institute of Southern California to an individual named Alex Vostrikov from Tashkent. From 1995 to 2001, the domain &quot;UZ&quot; was registered free of charge for anyone. In 2001, the rights to administer the domain were transferred to a representative in Uzbekistan, Tomas LLC, under the management of Euracom Equipment GmBH. After the appeal of the Uzbek Agency of Post and Telecommunications in December 2002, ICANN and IANA decided to re-delegate the right to manage the ccTLD to the UZINFOCOM Center (now the Single Integrator UZINFOCOM), which is currently the administrator of the ccTLD &quot;UZ&quot;.

On April 29, 2020, the national domain UZ celebrated its 25th anniversary

On April 28, 2021, the top-level domain .UZ was signed using DNSSEC technology

== Domains registration ==
Initially, the domain name &quot;UZ&quot; was issued free of charge until 2001. Then the registrar LLC &quot;Tomas&quot; took $89 per year for domain registration, with its subsequent reduction. In 2002, the price was reduced to $78, and from January 2003 - to $50 per year, and until 2005 it was $40. At the moment, the average price for domain registration in the &quot;UZ&quot; zone is 25,000 soums. The decline in prices began thanks to the emergence of six more official registrars since 2005.
Currently, almost 92000 active domains are registered in the domain zone.

In September 2019, to protect domain owners from cybersquatting, the Redemption Period service was introduced, thanks to which the former domain owners, after the expiration of the registration period, have the right to redeem the expired domain in their own name.

== Domain registrars ==
Domain registration is carried out in accordance with the &quot;Regulations on the procedure for registration and use of domain names in the UZ domain&quot; by legal entities that have acquired the right to work in the UZ domain.

Currently, there are 25 accredited registrars of the &quot;UZ&quot; domain in Uzbekistan, 8 of them are state unitary enterprises &quot;Computerization Center&quot; under regional khakimiyats (administrations).

Registrars register domains for a period of 1 to 10 years.

<doc id="1113778" wikidata="Q1171134" url="?curid=1113778" title="Heaven Tonight">
<text>Heaven Tonight is the third studio album by American rock band Cheap Trick. It was produced by Tom Werman and released on April 24, 1978. The album was remastered and released with bonus tracks on Sony&#x27;s Epic/Legacy imprint in 1998. The album cover features lead singer Robin Zander and bassist Tom Petersson on the front, with guitarist Rick Nielsen and drummer Bun E. Carlos on the back.

&quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; is considered Cheap Trick&#x27;s best album by many fans and critics. While their debut album &quot;Cheap Trick&quot; showed the band&#x27;s darker, rawer side and &quot;In Color&quot; explored a lighter, more pop-oriented persona, &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; combined both elements to produce a hook-filled pop-rock album with an attitude. Popular songs from this album include the anthemic &quot;Surrender&quot;, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen&quot;, the title track, and a cover of the Move&#x27;s &quot;California Man&quot;.

&quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; is also known as the first album ever recorded with a 12-string electric bass.

==Overview==
This was the second Cheap Trick album to feature Robin Zander and Tom Petersson on the front cover and Bun E. Carlos and Rick Nielsen on the back. While the front cover has Zander and Petersson standing in front of a nondescript background, the back cover portion (part of a continuous, wrap-around shot on the original LP) reveals that they are standing inside a public restroom where Nielsen is brushing his teeth and Carlos is fixing his tie in the mirror. Nielsen has a cassette copy of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;In Color&quot; sticking out of his back pocket. At the suggestion of the record company, the album was originally to be called &quot;American Standard&quot;; the cover photography was intended to play upon the secondary association with the well-known manufacturer of plumbing fixtures. The band were less pleased with the idea and opted for the release title, but the cover design remained.

&quot;Surrender&quot; was the only song from this album released on the original version of the 1979 live album &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;. On the 1998 reissue &quot;At Budokan: The Complete Concert&quot;, three additional songs from this album were included - &quot;Auf Wiedersehen&quot;, &quot;High Roller&quot; and &quot;California Man&quot;.

&quot;Oh Claire&quot; is a one-minute live jam with &quot;Oh, konnichi wa&quot; as the only lyrics. The title is a pun on Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where the band used to play frequently in their pre-stardom days. Cheap Trick wrote a similarly titled song, &quot;O Claire,&quot; for their 2006 album &quot;Rockford&quot;. &quot;How Are You&quot; contains, in its second verse, the extract of &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, sped up 10 times and inserted between the lyrics &#x27;you lie, you lie.&#x27; For the Epic Legacy release (1998), the original version of this track was replaced by a studio outtake with tabla drums and acoustic guitar instead of the electric version - no mention of this was made on the CD sleeve.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;Cheap Trick traces its ancestry from Led Zeppelin and do as well, especially on &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;, as any band toeing that particularly outdated line can do,&quot; opining that &quot;furious sounds proceed, none of which seem to match for energy the noises coming from the underground.&quot;

<doc id="1113784" wikidata="Q1759164" url="?curid=1113784" title="Open-design movement">
<text>The open-design movement involves the development of physical products, machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information. This includes the making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed without monetary compensation. The goals and philosophy of the movement are identical to that of the open-source movement, but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software. Open design is a form of co-creation, where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.

== Origin ==
Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century. Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing.
More recently, principles of open design have been related to the free and open-source software movements. In 1997 Eric S. Raymond, Tim O&#x27;Reilly and Larry Augustin established &quot;open source&quot; as an alternative expression to &quot;free software&quot;, and in 1997 Bruce Perens published &quot;The Open Source Definition&quot;. In late 1998, Dr. Sepehr Kiani (a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT) realized that designers could benefit from open source policies, and in early 1999 he convinced Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation, and set out to develop an Open Design Definition.

The idea of open design was taken up, either simultaneously or subsequently, by several other groups and individuals. The principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design, which emerged in March 1998 when Reinoud Lamberts of the Delft University of Technology proposed on his &quot;Open Design Circuits&quot; website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software.

Ronen Kadushin coined the title &quot;Open Design&quot; in his 2004 Master&#x27;s thesis, and the term was later formalized in the 2010 Open Design Manifesto.

== Current directions ==

The open-design movement currently unites two trends. On one hand, people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good, perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies. On the other hand, open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who, without the copyleft mechanism, might not collaborate otherwise. There is now also a third trend, where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source (e.g. 3D printing) but customized local solutions for sustainable development. Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as recent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means. The open-design movement may arguably organize production by prioritising socio-ecological well-being over corporate profits, over-production and excess consumption.

==Open machine design as compared to open-source software==

The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate.

However, there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced (see tools mentioned in the fab lab article).

== Organizations ==
Open design was considered in 2012 a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives. Many of these organizations are single, funded projects, while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development. In some cases (e.g. Thingiverse for 3D printable designs or Appropedia for open source appropriate technology) organizations are making an effort to create a centralized open source design repository as this enables innovation. Notable organizations include:

* AguaClara, an open-source engineering group at Cornell University publishing a design tool and CAD designs for water treatment plants
* Arduino, an open-source electronics hardware platform, community and company
* Elektor
* GrabCAD
* Instructables

<text>Melbourne University Football Club, often known simply as University, is an Australian rules football club based at the University of Melbourne. Founded in 1859, it is one of the oldest football clubs in the world. The club fields two teams, known as the &quot;Blacks&quot; and &quot;Blues&quot;, who both compete in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) in the William Buck Premier Division and the women&#x27;s team (nicknamed the &quot;Mugars&quot;) in the VAFA Women&#x27;s. 

The club achieved prominence by being a member of Victoria&#x27;s elite competition in the early 20th century, the Victorian Football League (VFL, now AFL), between 1908 and 1914, departing after its strict policy of amateurism left it uncompetitive in an increasingly professional league. It is one of only three clubs to leave the competition in its entire history. It is one of 13 clubs to have competed in both the VFA and the breakaway VFL competition prior to its expansion into a national competition. The women&#x27;s team also competed at the highest level of women&#x27;s competition, the Victorian Women&#x27;s Football League (VWFL) and VFL Women&#x27;s (VFLW) in 2016 prior to the formation of the national AFLW competition.

Although there are no records of its exact formation, University&#x27;s first recorded match took place in the same month that the Castlemaine Football Club was formed, making it possible that University is the second-oldest club in Australia.

==History==

===Early history (1859–1907) ===
University was founded in 1859 by students and graduates of the University of Melbourne. The first report of the university participating in a match was against a club named St Kilda (unrelated to the later VFL/AFL club) in June 1859. According to ‘Gymnastic’, writing in the sporting newspaper &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in Victoria&quot;, the ‘long pending match’ finally came off between two teams of 15. University was captained by a player called Phillips, and St Kilda emerged the winners. The winning team under the rules at the time was the first team to score two out of three goals.

The 15 man team in 1859 consisted of: Messrs. Browning, Bromby, Curlewis, Craig, Davis, Greene, Hart, Jacomb, Molesworth, Patterson, Philips, Purcell, Nunn, Oldham, Stephen, Walker.

Shortly afterwards, it played against teams from Albert Park, Carlton, Melbourne, Royal Park and South Yarra. 
In 1861, University defeated Melbourne to win the first ever trophy for Australian rules football, instituted as part of the Calendonian Society&#x27;s Games.

During the 1870s, the club played in the Second Twenties competition, the level below the main competition of the South Yarra Challenge Cup, except for in 1875 when it fielded a combined team with St. Kilda.

From 1885 to 1888, University played in the VFA, which at the time was both the major governing body and top level of senior Australian rules football.

From 1888 to 1904, the club spent periods in recess or playing in other competitions, including the Metropolitan Junior Football Association and the Colleges Football Association, and from 1905 to 1907 as a dominant member of the Metropolitan Football Association, also winning the national Intervarsity championship in 1906 and 1907.
=== VFL history (1908–1914) ===

On 4 October 1907, the eight founding clubs of the VFL voted to include University in the league as its ninth team, with the Richmond Football Club becoming the tenth team two weeks later. The club&#x27;s home ground was originally the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, where it was a tenant of the Essendon Football Club; after a lengthy dispute with Essendon over rent, the club relocated in 1911 to the Melbourne Cricket Ground which it also shared, this time with the Melbourne Football Club.

The club was nicknamed The Students, The Professors and The Shop. The players wore a black guernsey with a blue chevron and blue collars and cuffs (the same design is still used to this day), black and blue socks, and an optional black and blue cap. Players had to have matriculated or hold a higher degree to be eligible to play in the team.

The club was not particularly successful: it never finished higher than sixth in the ten-team competition, and never played in the finals. It finished last in the competition from 1911 to 1914, and lost its last 51 games in a row. In total, it played 126 games for 27 wins, 2 draws and 97 losses between 1908 and 1914.

The club is unique among VFL/AFL clubs in never having any professional players, and this was a major factor in its decline in competitiveness after 1911, when player payments were becoming common amongst the other clubs.

It became clear that the club could not remain competitive or viable in the VFL if it wished to remain amateur, and the fact that its players were focussed primarily on their studies (particularly during mid-year examinations) was another logistical issue for the club. As a consequence, the club withdrew from the VFL at the end of 1914.

Many of its players transferred to the Melbourne Football Club, under an informal agreement between the clubs aimed at keeping the best University players together in the same club to keep the University intervarsity team strong.

==== VFL Honour roll ====

==== University VFL players ====

Overall, 112 players played at least one game for University in the Victorian Football League between 1908 and 1914; and, of that 112, at least 20 died in active service in either World War I or World War II (see List of Victorian Football League players who died on active service).

Bert Hurrey played the most games for the club, with 101, and was the only University player to play at least 100 games in the VFA or VFL, while Roy Park was the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer, kicking 111 goals between 1912 and 1914: Park also won the VFL&#x27;s Leading Goalkicker Award in 1913 with 53 goals for the home-and-away season, a remarkable effort considering the team itself scored only 115 goals and finished last on the ladder without a win.

The following is a list of coaches to have coached the club in the VFL.

=== Post-VFL and post-war reformation (1919–) ===


In the summer of 1919, after the War, Melbourne University began to rebuild its football involvement. Deciding not to reapply for a position in the VFL, they were instead requested by the VFL to supply two teams to the newly formed VFL reserves competition, or the Victorian Junior Football League. These two teams were initially called University A and University B, but soon became known as &quot;University Blues&quot; and &quot;University Blacks&quot;, respectively (although the names did not become official until 1930). The Blues contested the 1919 and 1920 VJFL Grand Finals, losing to Collingwood on both occasions; the Blacks, who joined the 1919 VJFL season only at short notice when was unable to organise its own junior team, moved to the Metropolitan Amateur Football Association in 1920, and the following season, were joined by the Blues. Both contested the 1921 MAFA Grand Final, with the Blacks winning what to date is the only grand final the two teams have contested in the MAFA or VAFA.

Melbourne University students and alumni continue to maintain their involvement in football through the Blues and Blacks. The Melbourne University Football Club is unique in that it only plays as &quot;Melbourne University&quot; in inter-university matches, and its regular weekly competition is provided through its component teams, University Blues and University Blacks. The Blues and Blacks play in the Victorian Amateur Football Association, and have been a perennial power in the highest division of a high-standard amateur competition.

Up until the 1950s, the Blacks were the leading University side as well as one of the dominant sides in the Amateur competition, winning 11 A-Section premierships by 1949, including a record six premierships in a row between 1938 and 1949 (the 1940–1945 seasons not being played due to World War II). However, in the later part of the century the Blues established themselves as the premier University side, and are currently the longest serving club to play in the top division of the VAFA.

The Blacks have won a total of 14 A-section flags (their most recent in 2014 &amp; the most in the VAFA). The Blues have won a total of 4 A-section flags (with their most recent being in 2019).

Throughout their history, the Blues and Blacks have often played together in A section of the MAFA/VAFA, and with the Blacks return to A section in 2008 after a prolonged absence, the teams met again for the first time in 25 years. In head-to-head matches, the Blues lead the win tally with 43 wins to the Black&#x27;s 36 and one draw. The Blacks and the Blues added to their head-to-head history in 2015 after the Blues won promotion after only one year in B section in 2014. Unfortunately the Blacks dropped to B in 2018.

Both teams have consistently been a spawning ground for young players who go on to the AFL. To date, 240 MUFC players have played in the VFL/AFL competition.

From 1955 until 1996, an additional team was fielded by the club called University Reds which competed in the lower sections of the VAFA with a firsts and reserves team. When the team was discontinued by the club, players and supporters of the team decided to keep the team operating as the Fitzroy Reds. The Reds merged with the Fitzroy Football Club in 2008.

==Women&#x27;s team==

A women&#x27;s side was formed In 1996 as a stand-alone side that did not fall under the Melbourne University Football Club. The club was named Melbourne University Women&#x27;s Football Club and was nicknamed the MUGARS, an acronym for Melbourne University Girls Australian Rules Squad. In 2016, the MUWFC became a part of the MUFC and is equally represented alongside the Blacks and Blues sides on the MUFC board.

The MUWFC field three senior sides and three junior sides across three different leagues. Historically having senior teams in both the Victorian Women&#x27;s Football League and WRFL/EDFL Youth Girls Competition, in 2016, upon formation of the inaugural statewide competition aligned with the Victorian Football League, MUWFC entered a senior side, with a second and third team competing in the Premier Division and Division 3 of the Victorian Women&#x27;s Football League respectively. The WRFL/EDFL Youth Girls Competition also expanded from under-13s side and under-18s side to also include and under-15s side.

In 2002, MUWFC won their first premiership against St Albans in Division 1. This was followed by double premierships in 2003 and 2005, to make up the club&#x27;s five premierships.

In 2005, an Under-18s Youth Girls team was formed. They started competing in the Essendon Districts Football League in 2012.

From 2009, partnered with the club, allowing them to use Arden Street Oval for training and matches. Under this arrangement, Melbourne University served as North Melbourne&#x27;s VFL Women&#x27;s affiliate from 2016 until the end of 2019, when North Melbourne decided to field a standalone team instead.

In 2011, an Under-12s team was established in conjunction with North Melbourne Football Club.

The club also facilitates intervarsity teams, for both the Southern University Games and Australian University Games.

<text>The geology of the park is the consequence of deposition, uplift and erosion. Island in the Sky is a mesa overlooking the Green River (Colorado River tributary) to the west and the Colorado River to the east, and separated from the Colorado Plateau by &quot;the neck&quot;. From the top of the mesa to the Honaker Trail Formation at the canyon river bottom, 150 million years of geologic stratum is exposed. Upheaval Dome consists of the Chinle Formation in the center and the Navajo Sandstone along the rim. The Cedar Mesa Sandstone comprised the Needles District. Canyons comprise the Maze District.

==Deposition of sediments==

The exposed geology of the Canyonlands area is complex and diverse; 12 formations are exposed in Canyonlands National Park that range in age from Pennsylvanian to Cretaceous. The oldest and perhaps most interesting was created from evaporites deposited from evaporating seawater. Various fossil-rich limestones, sandstones, and shales were deposited by advancing and retreating warm shallow seas through much of the remaining Paleozoic.

Eroded sediment from a nearby mountain range later mixed with coastal dune and sand bar deposits. The end of the Paleozoic and the start of the Mesozoic saw the seas retreat from the region until the late Cenozoic. A subdued topography was dominated by flood plains and tidal flats. Now much further inland, the Triassic climate in the region was dry. Vast deserts covered much of that part of North America, except for one period when streams for a time fought the sand dunes. Wetter times returned in the Cretaceous as the area was flooded by the Western Interior Seaway.

The uplifting of the Rocky Mountains starting in late Cretaceous - greatly affected the Canyonlands region. Erosion rates increased and further quickened the onset of the ice ages in the Pleistocene. Modern-day erosion occurs at a slower rate.

===Hermosa Group===
A vast sea covered the region in early Pennsylvanian time. A basin in the area called Paradox Basin subsided and a mountain range called the Uncompahgre Mountains was uplifted to the east. Great quantities of seawater were trapped in the subsiding basin and water became increasingly saline in the hot and dry climate. Thousands of feet of evaporites (anhydrite and gypsum then halite) started to build up in the Mid Pennsylvanian and storms occasionally washed sediment from the nearby mountains. Fresh seawater periodically refilled the basin but was never able to flush out the very salty water there (the new water in fact floated on top of the brine). These beds were later lithified to become the Paradox Formation, which in turn is part of the Hermosa Group. 
Compressed salt beds from the Paradox started to flow plastically later in the Pennsylvanian and probably continued to move from then until the end of the Jurassic. Satellite-based measurements indicate that flow of salt and gypsum continues today to cause flexing and faulting of overlying sedimentary layers.

The Paradox is up to 5000 feet (1520 m) thick in places and in the park is exposed at the bottom of Cataract Canyon as rock gypsum inter-bedded with black shale. Upward movement of the Paradox is also a possible theory for the creation of Upheaval Dome, although none of the Paradox is exposed on the dome, the predominant theory being a meteor crater.

A warm shallow sea again flooded the region near the end of the Pennsylvanian. Limey oozes, sand, and mud were deposited on top of the salt-filled basin. These sediments became the fossil-rich limestones, sandstones, and shales of the gray-colored Honaker Trail Formation. Outcrops of the Honaker Trail can be seen near the bottom of deep canyons in the park, most notably along the Colorado River.

A period of erosion then ensued, creating a break in the geologic record called an unconformity.

===Cutler Group===
Early in the Permian a transgressing (advancing) sea laid down the Halgaito Shale. Coastal lowlands returned to the area after the sea regressed (retreated), forming the Elephant Canyon Formation. These formations can now be seen in Cataract and Elephant Canyons.

The Uncompahgre Mountains (Uncompahgre Plateau) were undergoing extensive erosion during this time. Large alluvial fans filled the basin where it met the range. The resulting Cutler red beds are made of iron-rich arkose sandstone. Underwater sand bars and sand dunes on the coast inter-fingered with the red beds and later became the white-colored cliff-forming Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Today these two competing rock units are exposed in a 4 to 5 mile (6.4 to 8 km) wide belt across the park, stretching from south of the Needles through the Maze and to the Elaterite Basin.

Brightly colored oxidized muds were deposited on top of the Cedar Mesa and ranged in color from red to brown. These sediments eventually became the slope-forming Organ Rock Shale formation and can be seen in the Land of Standing Rocks part of the park.

Coastal sand dunes and marine sand bars once again became dominant, creating the cross-bedded cliff-forming White Rim Sandstone. It is exposed as a topographic bench 1200 feet (365 m) below the top of Island in the Sky (thus earning its name) and along the White Rim Road. A fossilized offshore sand bar made of the White Cliff Sandstone is also exposed in the Elaterite Basin. A tarry dark-brown oil called elaterite seeps out of the structure, giving the basin its name.

The Permian sea retreated, which exposed the land to a long period of erosion and thus created a second unconformity.

===Moenkopi and Chinle formations ===

Clastic red beds were laid down in shallow-water on top of the eroded Paleozoic surface early in the Triassic. These sediments were deposited on flood plains by streams on an expansive lowland that was slightly sloped in the direction of an ocean to the west. Mud built up in tidal flats to become the mudstone of Moenkopi Formation. Examples of this formation, some that still show fossilized ripple marks and mudcracks, can be seen in the northern and western parts of the park.

Another period of erosion returned, creating a third unconformity. The brightly colored shales of the slope-forming Chinle Formation were laid down on top of this eroded surface. Petrified wood from the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle is sometimes found at the base of Chinle slopes.

===Glen Canyon Group===

The Glen Canyon Group of formations includes (from oldest - lowest - to youngest) the
*Wingate Sandstone,
*Kayenta Formation, and the
*Navajo Sandstone
These formations are most prominently exposed in the western and northern sections of the park.

Triassic climates progressively became dryer, prompting the formation of sand dunes that buried dry stream beds and their flood plain. This sand became the cliff-forming several hundred feet (many tens of meters) high and red-colored Windgate Sandstone. Outcrops tend to run for hundreds of miles (hundreds of kilometers) with few breaks, creating an impediment to human travel.

For a time climatic conditions became wetter and streams cut channels through the sand dunes. Reddish-brown to lavender-colored sandstones interbedded with siltstones and shales constitute the resulting ledgy slope-forming Kayenta Formation.

The youngest and therefore topmost formation in the Glen Canyon Group was formed after arid conditions returned to the region. A vast and very dry desert, not unlike the modern Sahara, covered 150,000 square miles (388,000 km2) of western North America. Cross bedded sand dunes accumulated to great thickness, especially in the nearby Zion and Kolob canyons area (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area), forming the buff to pale orange Navajo Sandstone. Navajo outcrops form cliffs, temples, and under certain conditions natural arches (such as Millard Canyon Arch) in the area.

A fourth unconformity was created by a period of erosion.

===San Rafael Group===
Mud flats developed on top of the eroded surface of the Glen Canyon Group, forming the Carmel Formation. The massive cliff-forming Entrada Sandstone in turn was created on top of the Carmel. A long period of erosion stripped away most of the San Rafael Group in the area along with any formations that may have been laid down in the Cretaceous period.

==Uplift==
Starting 70 million years ago and extending well into the Cenozoic, a mountain-building event called the Laramide orogeny uplifted the Rocky Mountains and with it the Canyonlands region. Even though the strata were uplifted thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) they were left at more-or-less the same horizontally. Uplift-associated-jointing did occur and has since influenced erosional patterns.

When ground water seeped into the salt beds of the Paradox Formation it carried away the topmost and more soluble salts, leaving gypsum. This process was so pronounced in ‘’The Grabens’’ that the overlying rock collapsed into voids left by escaping salt.

Increased precipitation during the ice ages of the Pleistocene quickened the rate of canyon excavation. Canyon widening and deepening was especially rapid for the gorges of the Green and Colorado Rivers, which were in part fed by glacier-melt from the Rocky Mountains. Alluvial-fan-creation-landslides and sand dune-migration were also accelerated in the Pleistocene. These processes continue to shape the Canyonlands landscape in the Holocene (the current epoch), but at a slower rate due to a significant increase in aridity.

<text>King Xi of Zhou (died 677 BC) (), personal name Ji Huqi, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty.

He was the successor to his father King Zhuang, and was in turn succeeded by his son, King Hui.

By the time of King Xi&#x27;s reign, China proper had dissolved into a multitude of Warring States, only nominally subject to the Eastern Zhou king, who was no longer even the most powerful figure (that was Duke Huan of the Qi state).

<doc id="1113812" wikidata="Q2261222" url="?curid=1113812" title="Mosh (song)">
<text>&quot;Mosh&quot; is a protest song by Eminem from his fifth studio album, &quot;Encore&quot;. The song debuted on Eminem&#x27;s official mixtape, &quot;Shade 45: Sirius Bizness&quot;, on October 20, 2004, which has Eminem standing in front of the White House holding an American flag on its cover. Days later, on October 26, one week before the 2004 presidential election, a promotional video created by Guerrilla News Network debuted on the company&#x27;s website. The video aired on MTV the following day and immediately went to the top of the channel&#x27;s &quot;hot video&quot; charts. The song, released to encourage voters to vote George W. Bush out of office, did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs because it was released only as a promotional video and album track.

==Music video==
The video, mostly animated and directed by Ian Inaba of the Guerrilla News Network, portrays Eminem as a powerful rebellious figure who, just by using his voice and music, can mobilize people who are fed up with the president. With his following uniformly dressed in dark hoodies, the group looks to be storming toward the White House but ends up signing up to vote. At the same time in the song, Eminem talks about the people assembling to disarm what he calls the real weapon of mass destruction: George W. Bush. The video ends with a black screen and the words &quot;Vote November 2&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted the song. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote a mixed description, saying the song &quot;was nothing less than the sound of America&#x27;s favorite Caucasian rapper at his most intense and focused. Protest songs made a comeback this year, but none captured doom and apocalypse the way &#x27;Mosh&#x27; so brilliantly did. Eminem is still a narcissist, of course — he wants us to follow him to liberation, or at least to the voting booth — but the power of &#x27;Mosh&#x27; made you forgive his never-ending self-absorption&quot; and called the song itself an anomaly. &quot;DX&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;he (Eminem) turns political and blatantly lashes out at Bush on &#x27;Mosh&#x27; (sure to cause some repercussions from politicians considering his visibility).&quot; Pitchfork Media wrote a mixed review: &quot;&#x27;Mosh&#x27;—sadly, not yet completely past its sell-by date—seems more like a plodding dirge here among the spry string of tracks that surround it.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; magazine wrote a favorable review: &quot;And then there&#x27;s &#x27;Mosh&#x27;. Oh boy, there&#x27;s &#x27;Mosh&#x27;. --- Should &#x27;Encore&#x27; prove to be a swansong, then &#x27;Mosh&#x27; is its blaze of glory, a scalding assault on the Bush regime that hits all the harder for its arriving days too late. The rapper sounds absolutely livid as he mounts a stealthy assault on the Prez that swells with density and rage over its five minutes until fire and brimstone is raining down on the shitwit Texan&#x27;s perpetually befuddled head. Although you might argue that everything Eminem says is inherently political through the sheer numbers that he reaches and the sheer anti-social nature of most of what he espouses, this is a different kettle of politicised fish entirely. &quot;If it rains, let it rain/Yeah, the wetter the better/They ain&#x27;t gonna stop us, they can&#x27;t/We&#x27;re stronger now more than ever&quot;, he rages with a demented fervour that makes Rage Against the Machine sound like Belle &amp; Sebastian. And if that non-specific rabble-rousery is a little on the vague side, the likes of &quot;Stomp, push, shove, mush/Fuck Bush until they bring our troops home&quot; should make it crystal clear. On a more base level, it&#x27;s fucking fantastic to jump up and down and bang your head to, which is the level where politics and pop most effectively connect.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; said that the song &quot;[lambastes] President Bush and his war policies.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote of the song: &quot;[Eminem] stops attacking scapegoats and straw men and finally goes after the people who actually wield power. Over Dr. Dre&#x27;s apocalyptic production—all rain-clouds and thunderclaps—Eminem launches into a searing, overtly emotional attack on President Bush and his administration&#x27;s bloodlust and misplaced priorities. Eminem has always been angry, but his anger has never before been this righteous, focused, or plugged in to what matters in American life.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was somewhat positive too: he stated that Eminem &quot;catches us off-guard with eloquent political reflections in &#x27;Mosh,&#x27; his equivalent of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;.&quot; While Eminem&#x27;s rap doesn&#x27;t have the timelessness or literary aspirations of the Dylan song, it hits with the visceral charge and topical urgency of the best rap. Lashing out at various social injustices, he leads a legion of young followers toward what appears to be the kind of violent rebellion one might expect in hard-core rock and rap. Instead, as the video for &#x27;Mosh&#x27; shows, their charge is to the voting booth.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called the song a &quot;potent anti-Bush rant&quot;. &quot;SPIN&quot; was a bit positive: &quot;The seething anti-Bush single &#x27;Mosh&#x27; may not have brought droves of Eminem acolytes to the polls last November, but it suggests that Em—like fellow potty-mouth-turned activist Howard Stern—realizes that his gifts have uses beyond FCC-baiting and fart jokes.&quot;

RapReviews was also unimpressed: &quot;&#x27;Mosh&#x27; suffers from a similar stigma: a disconcerted, ADD Eminem who can&#x27;t seem to lock down his lyrics.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;[Was &quot;Encore&quot;] a feint designed to double the wallop of &#x27;Mosh,&#x27; which signaled a Marshall Mathers gone political — too late to help his candidate, but, be real, the Muse doesn&#x27;t follow a schedule.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; was positive: &quot;Finally, there is Mosh, the anti-war, anti-Bush track &quot;leaked&quot; just before the election. It offers both the best lyric Eminem has ever written and the one moment on the album where the repetitious production style works, providing a suitably relentless basis for his quickfire hectoring. That Mosh seemingly did nothing to affect the election&#x27;s outcome is something of a double-edged sword.&quot; Franklin Soults of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; was a bit negative toward the song: &quot;In the latest &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Eminem says he hopes his galvanizing anti-Bush single &quot;Mosh&quot; wasn&#x27;t &quot;too little, too late.&quot; Well, it was, and this puke-and-shit-stained album makes it even less likely that sympathizers who read &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; or the &quot;Phoenix&quot; will reach out for it anyway&quot;; he did state, however, that the album had &quot;several moments more consistently remarkable than &#x27;Mosh&#x27;&quot;, including &quot;Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that this song &quot;gained notoriety for its anti-Bush lyrics, but Eminem sounds nearly as long-winded as the politicians he&#x27;s excoriating.&quot; &quot;Shaking Through&quot; called this song &quot;political screed.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a protest song originally intended solely for online promotion but which quickly earned its status as the album&#x27;s official second single. &#x27;Mosh&#x27; is not only a worthy follow-up to &#x27;Lose Yourself,&#x27; it had the potential to shepherd thousands of young, seemingly apathetic voters to the polls on Election Day—had it not been released after almost every registration deadline in the country.&quot; The publisher added that the song &quot;[matched] America&#x27;s angriest pop voice with America&#x27;s most righteous pastime: Bush-bashing. George W. Bush and Eminem might seem like unlikely foes—after all, the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right?—but Eminem is the poster boy for pushing the limits of the 1st Amendment, and bashing the President is currently the most vilified form of free speech in the country, so who better to champion the cause? &#x27;Maybe this is God just sayin&#x27; we&#x27;re responsible/For this monster, this coward that we have empowered,&#x27; he spits rhythmically atop a sturdy, dirge-like beat.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; was the most negative of all: &quot;Add [in] Em&#x27;s brand new tendency to bite himself, and you&#x27;ve actually got a pretty airtight case for playing the career suicide card.&quot;

<text>James William Carruthers (5 July 1929 – 15 August 1990) was an Australian boxer, who became world champion in the bantamweight division.

Jimmy was the 2009 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Veterans category.

==Amateur career==
Carruthers&#x27;s boxing career started as an Australian representative at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. In his first-round match of the bantamweight competition, he fought Fred Daigle of Canada and won on points. He defeated Arnoldo Parés of Argentina in his second match. However, he had sustained an eye injury during his bout with Parés, and had to withdraw from the quarter-final match with the eventual gold medalist Tibor Csík of Hungary.

==Professional career==
Carruthers joined the professional ranks in 1950, and was an immediate success. By then, he was being managed by Dr. Jim McGirr, and trained by &quot;Silent&quot; Bill McConnell.

He won the Australian Bantamweight title in 1951 and then the British Commonwealth and Bantamweight Championship of the world the following year. Carruthers became Australia&#x27;s first universally recognised boxing world champion when he knocked out the guy who had been crowned South Africa&#x27;s first world champion himself, Vic Toweel, in the first round. Great Australians of the past—including Young Griffo, Mick King, and Les Darcy—had all won world titles, but they had not received international acceptance at the time of winning their respective crowns. After defending his newly won world bantamweight title by knocking out Toweel in the tenth round of their rematch at Johannesburg, and then against the American Henry &quot;Pappy&quot; Gault in Sydney, by a fifteen-rounds decision, it was found that Carruthers was carrying a 30-foot-long tapeworm.

He was matched for a world title bout against the New Zealand Bantamweight Champion Lyn Philp. For unclear reasons the fight never went ahead.

After a non-title bout in Sydney, and a further title defence against Chamroen Songkitrat in Bangkok, Carruthers retired on 16 May 1954. Among the fighters he defeated were South African Vic Toweel (twice); Pappy Gault; Bobby Sinn and Chamroen Songkitrat. He made a brief comeback in Melbourne and Sydney in the early sixties in non-title fights, with his last fight in Wellington New Zealand in 1962 where he lost to Jimmy Cassidy.

==Personal==
He worked on the Sydney docks as a wharf labourer in the 1950s.

Carruthers was married to Myra (née Hamilton) until his death and is survived by four children - Boyd, Ginna, Dimiette and Lukas. During the 1950s he owned the colourful Bells Hotel in Sydney&#x27;s Woolloomooloo. After that he had a number of businesses, including several vegetarian takeaway and juice bars in Sydney.

In his last years Carruthers suffered from lung cancer and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died on 15 August 1990. In 1995 he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1113819" wikidata="Q228491" url="?curid=1113819" title="Mutator method">
<text>In computer science, a mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter, which returns the value of the private member variable. They are also known collectively as accessors.

The mutator method is most often used in object-oriented programming, in keeping with the principle of encapsulation. According to this principle, member variables of a class are made private to hide and protect them from other code, and can only be modified by a public member function (the mutator method), which takes the desired new value as a parameter, optionally validates it, and modifies the private member variable. Mutator methods can be compared to assignment operator overloading but they typically appear at different levels of the object hierarchy.

Mutator methods may also be used in non-object-oriented environments. In this case, a reference to the variable to be modified is passed to the mutator, along with the new value. In this scenario, the compiler cannot restrict code from bypassing the mutator method and changing the variable directly. The responsibility falls to the developers to ensure the variable is only modified through the mutator method and not modified directly.

In programming languages that support them, properties offer a convenient alternative without giving up the utility of encapsulation.

In the examples below, a fully implemented mutator method can also validate the input data or take further action such as triggering an event.

==Implications==
The alternative to defining mutator and accessor methods, or property blocks, is to give the instance variable some visibility other than private and access it directly from outside the objects. Much finer control of access rights can be defined using mutators and accessors. For example, a parameter may be made read-only simply by defining an accessor but not a mutator. The visibility of the two methods may be different; it is often useful for the accessor to be public while the mutator remains protected, package-private or internal.

The block where the mutator is defined provides an opportunity for validation or preprocessing of incoming data. If all external access is guaranteed to come through the mutator, then these steps cannot be bypassed. For example, if a date is represented by separate private codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 variables, then incoming dates can be split by the codice_4 mutator while for consistency the same private instance variables are accessed by codice_5 and codice_6. In all cases month values outside of 1 - 12 can be rejected by the same code.

Accessors conversely allow for synthesis of useful data representations from internal variables while keeping their structure encapsulated and hidden from outside modules. A monetary codice_7 accessor may build a string from a numeric variable with the number of decimal places defined by a hidden codice_8 parameter.

Modern programming languages often offer the ability to generate the boilerplate for mutators and accessors in a single line—as for example C#&#x27;s codice_9 and Ruby&#x27;s codice_10. In these cases, no code blocks are created for validation, preprocessing or synthesis. These simplified accessors still retain the advantage of encapsulation over simple public instance variables, but it is common that, as system designs progress, the software is maintained and requirements change, the demands on the data become more sophisticated. Many automatic mutators and accessors eventually get replaced by separate blocks of code. The benefit of automatically creating them in the early days of the implementation is that the public interface of the class remains identical whether or not greater sophistication is added, requiring no extensive refactoring if it is. 

Manipulation of parameters that have mutators and accessors from &quot;inside&quot; the class where they are defined often requires some additional thought. In the early days of an implementation, when there is little or no additional code in these blocks, it makes no difference if the private instance variable is accessed directly or not. As validation, cross-validation, data integrity checks, preprocessing or other sophistication is added, subtle bugs may appear where some internal access makes use of the newer code while in other places it is bypassed.

Accessor functions can be less efficient than directly fetching or storing data fields due to the extra steps involved, however such functions are often inlined which eliminates the overhead of a function call.

==Examples==
===Assembly===

student struct
 age dd ?

 .code
student_get_age proc object:DWORD
 mov ebx, object
 mov eax, student.age[ebx]
 ret
student_get_age endp

student_set_age proc object:DWORD, age:DWORD
 mov ebx, object
 mov eax, age
 mov student.age[ebx], eax
 ret
student_set_age endp
===C===

 return 0;


In file Makefile:

all: out.txt; cat $&lt;
out.txt: main; ./$&lt; &gt; $@
main: main.o student.o
main.o student.o: student.h
clean: ;$(RM) *.o out.txt main
===C++===
In file Student.h:

#ifndef STUDENT_H
#define STUDENT_H

#include &lt;string&gt;

class Student {
public:
 Student(const std::string&amp; name);

 const std::string&amp; name() const;
 void name(const std::string&amp; name);

private:
 std::string name_;

#endif

In file Student.cpp:

#include &quot;Student.h&quot;

Student::Student(const std::string&amp; name) : name_(name) {

const std::string&amp; Student::name() const {
 return name_;

void Student::name(const std::string&amp; name) {
 name_ = name;


===C#===
This example illustrates the C# idea of properties, which are a special type of class member. Unlike Java, no explicit methods are defined; a public &#x27;property&#x27; contains the logic to handle the actions. Note use of the built-in (undeclared) variable codice_11. 
public class Student
 private string name;

 /// &lt;summary&gt;
 /// Gets or sets student&#x27;s name
 /// &lt;/summary&gt;
 public string Name
 get { return name; }
 set { name = value; }
}
In later C# versions (.NET Framework 3.5 and above), this example may be abbreviated as follows, without declaring the private variable codice_12.
public class Student
 public string Name { get; set; }


Using the abbreviated syntax means that the underlying variable is no longer available from inside the class. As a result, the codice_13 portion of the property must be present for assignment. Access can be restricted with a codice_13-specific access modifier.

public class Student
 public string Name { get; private set; }


===Common Lisp===
In Common Lisp Object System, slot specifications within class definitions may specify any of the codice_15, codice_16 and codice_17 options (even multiple times) to define reader methods, setter methods and accessor methods (a reader method and the respective codice_18 method). Slots are always directly accessible through their names with the use of codice_19 and codice_20, and the slot accessor options define specialized methods that use codice_20.

CLOS itself has no notion of properties, although the MetaObject Protocol extension specifies means to access a slot&#x27;s reader and writer function names, including the ones generated with the codice_17 option.

The following example shows a definition of a student class using these slot options and direct slot access:

(defclass student ()
 ((name :initarg :name :initform &quot;&quot; :accessor student-name) ; student-name is setf&#x27;able
 (birthdate :initarg :birthdate :initform 0 :reader student-birthdate)
 (number :initarg :number :initform 0 :reader student-number :writer set-student-number)))

;; Example of a calculated property getter (this is simply a method)
(defmethod student-age ((self student))
 (- (get-universal-time) (student-birthdate self)))

;; Example of direct slot access within a calculated property setter
(defmethod (setf student-age) (new-age (self student))
 (with-slots (birthdate) self
 (setf birthdate (- (get-universal-time) new-age))
 new-age))

;; The slot accessing options generate methods, thus allowing further method definitions
(defmethod set-student-number :before (new-number (self student))
 ;; You could also check if a student with the new-number already exists.
 (check-type new-number (integer 1 *)))
===D===
D supports a getter and setter function syntax. In version 2 of the language getter and setter class/struct methods should have the codice_23 attribute.

class Student {
 private char[] name_;
 // Getter
 @property char[] name() {
 return this.name_;
 // Setter
 @property char[] name(char[] name_in) {
 return this.name_ = name_in;
}

A codice_24 instance can be used like this:

auto student = new Student;
student.name = &quot;David&quot;; // same effect as student.name(&quot;David&quot;)
auto student_name = student.name; // same effect as student.name()
===Delphi===
This is a simple class in Delphi language which illustrates the concept of public property for accessing a private field. 
interface

type
 TStudent = class
 strict private
 FName: string;
 procedure SetName(const Value: string);
 public
 /// &lt;summary&gt;
 /// Get or set the name of the student.
 /// &lt;/summary&gt;
 property Name: string read FName write SetName;
 end;

implementation

procedure TStudent.SetName(const Value: string);
begin
 FName := Value;
end;

end.
===Java===
In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable &quot;name&quot; is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the &quot;setter&quot; and &quot;getter&quot; are public, namely the &quot;codice_25&quot; and &quot;codice_26&quot; methods.

public class Student {
 private String name;

 public String getName() {
 return name;
 
 public void setName(String newName) {
 name = newName;
}

===JavaScript===
In this example constructor-function codice_24 is used to create objects representing a student with only the name stored.

function Student(name) {
 var _name = name;

 this.getName = function() {
 return _name;

 this.setName = function(value) {
 _name = value;
}

Or (using a deprecated way to define accessors in Web browsers):

function Student(name){
 var _name = name;
 this.__defineGetter__(&#x27;name&#x27;, function() {
 return _name;
 
 this.__defineSetter__(&#x27;name&#x27;, function(value) {
 _name = value;
}

Or (using prototypes for inheritance and ES6 accessor syntax):

function Student(name){
 this._name = name;

Student.prototype = {
 get name() {
 return this._name;
 set name(value) {
 this._name = value;
};

Or (without using prototypes):

var Student = {
 get name() {
 return this._name;
 set name(value) {
 this._name = value;
};

Or (using defineProperty):

function Student(name){
 this._name = name;
Object.defineProperty(Student.prototype, &#x27;name&#x27;, {
 get: function() {
 return this._name;
 set: function(value) {
 this._name = value;
});
===ActionScript 3.0===

package
 public class Student
 private var _name : String;
 public function get name() : String
 return _name;

 public function set name(value : String) : void
 _name = value;
 }


===Objective-C===
Using traditional Objective-C 1.0 syntax, with manual reference counting as the one working on GNUstep on Ubuntu 12.04:

@interface Student : NSObject
 NSString *_name;

- (NSString *)name;
- (void)setName:(NSString *)name;

@end

@implementation Student

- (NSString *)name
 return _name;

- (void)setName:(NSString *)name
 [_name release];
 _name = [name retain];

@end

Using newer Objective-C 2.0 syntax as used in Mac OS X 10.6, iOS 4 and Xcode 3.2, generating the same code as described above:

@interface Student : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name;

@end

@implementation Student

@synthesize name = _name;

@end

And starting with OS X 10.8 and iOS 6, while using Xcode 4.4 and up, syntax can be even simplified:

@interface Student : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;

@end

@implementation Student

//Nothing goes here and it&#x27;s OK.

@end
===Perl===

package Student;

sub new {
 bless {}, shift;

sub set_name {
 my $self = shift;
 $self-&gt;{name} = $_[0];

sub get_name {
 my $self = shift;
 return $self-&gt;{name};

1;
Or, using Class::Accessor

package Student;
use base qw(Class::Accessor);
__PACKAGE__-&gt;follow_best_practice;

Student-&gt;mk_accessors(qw(name));

1;
Or, using the Moose Object System:

package Student;
use Moose;

# Moose uses the attribute name as the setter and getter, the reader and writer properties
# allow us to override that and provide our own names, in this case get_name and set_name
has &#x27;name&#x27; =&gt; (is =&gt; &#x27;rw&#x27;, isa =&gt; &#x27;Str&#x27;, reader =&gt; &#x27;get_name&#x27;, writer =&gt; &#x27;set_name&#x27;);

1;
===PHP===
PHP defines the &quot;magic methods&quot; codice_28andcodice_29 for properties of objects.

In this example of a simple class representing a student with only the name stored, one can see the variable &quot;name&quot; is private, i.e. only visible from the Student class, and the &quot;setter&quot; and &quot;getter&quot; is public, namely the codice_25 and codice_31 methods.

class Student
 private string $name;
 * @return string The name.
 public function getName(): string
 return $this-&gt;name;

 * @param string $newName The name to set.
 public function setName(string $newName): void
 $this-&gt;name = $newName;
}

===Python===
This example uses a Python class with one variable, a getter, and a setter.
class Student:
 # Initializer
 def __init__(self, name: str) -&gt; None:
 # An instance variable to hold the student&#x27;s name
 self._name = name

 # Getter method
 @property
 def name(self):
 return self._name

 # Setter method
 @name.setter
 def name(self, new_name):
 self._name = new_name
»&gt; bob = Student(&quot;Bob&quot;)

===Racket===
In Racket, the object system is a way to organize code that comes in addition to modules and units. As in the rest of the language, the object system has first-class values and lexical scope is used to control access to objects and methods.
#lang racket
(define student%
 (class object%
 (init-field name)
 (define/public (get-name) name)
 (define/public (set-name! new-name) (set! name new-name))
 (super-new)))

(define s (new student% [name &quot;Alice&quot;]))
(send s get-name) ; =&gt; &quot;Alice&quot;
(send s set-name! &quot;Bob&quot;)
(send s get-name) ; =&gt; &quot;Bob&quot;
Struct definitions are an alternative way to define new types of values, with mutators being present when explicitly required:

#lang racket
(struct student (name) #:mutable)
(define s (student &quot;Alice&quot;))
(set-student-name! s &quot;Bob&quot;)
(student-name s) ; =&gt; &quot;Bob&quot;
===Ruby===
In Ruby, individual accessor and mutator methods may be defined, or the metaprogramming constructs codice_32 or codice_33 may be used both to declare a private variable in a class and to provide either read-only or read-write public access to it respectively.

Defining individual accessor and mutator methods creates space for pre-processing or validation of the data

class Student
 def name
 @name
 end

 def name=(value)
 @name=value
 end
end
Read-only simple public access to implied codice_34 variable

class Student
 attr_reader :name
end
Read-write simple public access to implied codice_34 variable

class Student
 attr_accessor :name
end
===Rust===

struct Student {
 name: String,

impl Student {
 fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;String {
 &amp;self.name

 fn name_mut(&amp;mut self) -&gt; &amp;mut String {
 &amp;mut self.name
}

===Smalltalk===

 age: aNumber
 &quot; Set the receiver age to be aNumber if is greater than 0 and less than 150 &quot;
 (aNumber between: 0 and: 150)
 ifTrue: [ age := aNumber ]
===Swift===

class Student {
 private var _name: String = &quot;&quot;

 var name: String {
 get {
 return self._name
 set {
 self._name = newValue
 }


===Visual Basic .NET===
This example illustrates the VB.NET idea of properties, which are used in classes. Similar to C#, there is an explicit use of the codice_36 and codice_37 methods. 

Public Class Student

 Private _name As String

 Public Property Name()
 Get
 Return _name
 End Get
 Set(ByVal value)
 _name = value
 End Set
 End Property

End Class

In VB.NET 2010, Auto Implemented properties can be utilized to create a property without having to use the Get and Set syntax. Note that a hidden variable is created by the compiler, called codice_38, to correspond with the Property codice_12. Using another variable within the class named codice_38 would result in an error. Privileged access to the underlying variable is available from within the class.

Public Class Student
 Public Property name As String
End Class

<text>.jm is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Jamaica. Registrations are at the third level beneath the second level names com.jm, net.jm, org.jm, edu.jm, gov.jm, and mil.jm. Registrations are processed by hand rather than automatically, so registrants are asked to allow 30 days for the registrations to be completed. Updates to domain names (such as changes to nameservers) can only be authorized by the technical or registrant e-mail addresses. Registration of .jm domains is handled by Mona Information Technology Services (MITS) at the University of the West Indies. Registration is free, although there has been some discussion about MITS making the service commercial in the coming years.

<text>Marc Burns (born 7 January 1983) is an athlete from Trinidad and Tobago specializing in the 100 metres and the 4 x 100 metres relay.

Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was disqualified from his 100 metres heat due to a false start, thus failing to make it through to the second round.

Marc Burns placed second in the men&#x27;s 100 metres dash at the Bislett Games IAAF Golden League meet in Oslo in July 2005, in preparation for the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. At the 2005 World Championships he won (together with Kevon Pierre, Jacey Harper and Darrel Brown) a silver medal. Later that year he won the World Athletics Final.

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games he won a bronze medal over 100 metres.

He was a finalist in the 100 m final at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka.

At the London Grand Prix he ran a season&#x27;s best time of 9.97 seconds coming second behind former world record holder Asafa Powell.

In the 2008 Summer Olympics he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 2nd in his heat after Samuel Francis in a time of 10.46 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he improved his time to 10.05 seconds, winning his race with opponents as Kim Collins and Tyrone Edgar. In the semi-finals he finished 3rd (9.97 seconds) in his heat behind Usain Bolt and Walter Dix and qualified for the final. There he finished his race in 7th place in a time of 10.01 seconds. Together with Keston Bledman, Aaron Armstrong and Richard Thompson he also competed at the 4x100 metres relay. In their qualification heat they placed first in front of Japan, the Netherlands and Brazil. Their time of 38.26 was the fastest of all sixteen teams participating in the first round and they qualified for the final. Armstrong was replaced by Emmanuel Callender for the final race and they sprinted to a time of 38.06 seconds, the second time after the Jamaican team, winning the silver medal. In 2022, Burns and his teammates received the gold medal due to Jamaica&#x27;s Nesta Carter testing positive for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was part of the Trinidad and Tobago team that won the silver medal in the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay. He was also part of the team that won the bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

Burns was coached most of his professional career by Henry Rolle.

<text>.re is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Réunion (a French island located in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar). Along with .fr, .tf, and .ovh, it is administered by AFNIC.

In recent years, the .re TLD has been increasingly used for real estate–related domains, including place names (neighborhoods, cities, countries, etc.), real estate companies, developers/projects, property-related websites, and individual realtors and estate agents around the world. The .re domain has also been applied to insurance and reinsurance companies (e.g. swiss.re), those involved with reverse engineering, and as domain hacks for words ending in .re (for example, adventu.re or nearfutu.re), similar to contractions used with other TLDs (for example, websites such as bit.ly and delicio.us). Domains with the .re TLD can be registered with some of the largest online registrars such as Name.com, as well as most European domain registrars.

Since 6 December 2011, the rules for registering French domains have shifted. The owner of a domain no longer needs to be based in France or Overseas France anymore, with all individuals, companies and organizations residing in the European Union able register domains of France or its possessions.

==Two-character domains==
.re allows two-character domains with at least one number. So, m7.re or 42.re are acceptable, while fi.re is not.

==Second-level domains==
In addition to direct second level registrations, registrations have been made at the third level beneath these names:

* .asso.re: associations
* .nom.re: surnames
* .com.re: commercial (unrestricted registration)
* .can.re: Unconditional and Undocumented (Registrar: Yöncü Bilişim Çözümleri)

Starting December 6, 2011, domain names at the official subdomains can no longer be registered. The owner of such domain names can renew their existing domains.

<text>Ian Read is an English neofolk and traditional folk musician, and occultist active within chaos magic and Germanic mysticism circles.

Read was a member of Sol Invictus, and founded Fire + Ice in 1991.
==Early life==
Read left school at 16, and at the age of 17, he became an adherent of Germanic neopaganism and began studying Germanic paganism.

==Music career==
In 1987, Read joined Tony Wakeford&#x27;s Sol Invictus along with Karl Blake. Read recorded three albums and an EP with Sol Invictus before leaving to form the band Fire + Ice in 1991.

Ian Read founded an all traditional folk band named Figg&#x27;s Academy that played a couple of gigs, notably in 2008 at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig.

===Fire + Ice===
Read founded Fire + Ice in 1991 after several years as a member of Sol Invictus. According to their sole website, &quot;The heartlessness of the modern commercial consumer society ruins the lives of many. FIRE + ICE takes the purity and philosophy of early music and melds it into a message redolent with powerful seeds of honour, truth, loyalty and the bond of true friendship.&quot;

His work as Fire + Ice have had a large amount of influence on neofolk music.

The band played Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig in 1999 with a lineup that included Ysanne Spevack and Julia Kent.

The band followed up by releasing a split 7-inch single with the neofolk song The Unquiet Grave recorded in London in 2000, featuring vocals and viola by Ysanne Spevack as a duet with Ian Read. It was released in Germany by Tesco Distribution on blue vinyl with a letterpress foil gatefold cover.

==Other pursuits==
In 1996, Read was named as a Rune-Master within the Rune-Gild. His master work was the Fire + Ice album &quot;Rûna&quot; that included a self-written and sung galdor (or galdr) of the Rune poem. Read presently holds the position of Drighten in the Rune Gild and co-published the periodical &quot;Rûna&quot;, which ceased after 24 issues.

Read became the leader of the English branch of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT), in the early 1990s after founder Peter Carroll stepped down as leading Magus. Read is currently the editor of the IOT&#x27;s &quot;Chaos International&quot;.

==Discography==
===With Current 93===
He participated to the sessions of Current 93&#x27;s album &quot;Swastikas For Noddy&quot;, therefore he appears on this album and some subsequent albums containing remixes of this material:
* &quot;Swastikas For Noddy&quot;, 1987
* &quot;Looney Runes&quot;, 1988
* &quot;Earth Covers Earth&quot;, 1988
* &quot;Crooked Crosses For The Nodding God&quot;, 1989
* &quot;Swastikas For Goddy&quot;, 1993

===With Death In June===
He participated to Death in June&#x27;s album &quot;Brown Book&quot; and the tracks have appeared in subsequent Death In June&#x27;s releases as well:
* &quot;Brown Book&quot;, 1987

<text>.ru is the Latin alphabet Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Russia introduced on 7 April 1994. The Russian alphabet internationalized country code is .рф.

Control of .ru is assigned to the Coordination Center for TLD RU (CC for TLD RU), the current official registry. On 1 January 2005, the former registry, the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN), stopped new registrations directly under .ru, but still carried out registry operations for domain names under the second-level domains .com.ru, .net.ru, .org.ru and .pp.ru.

The company RELCOM also proposes third-level registrations beneath various second-level domains such as .msk.ru (Moscow), while Macomnet Telcom proposes third-level registrations beneath .int.ru simultaneously.

== Background ==
The creation of .ru in April 1994 was preceded by a historical agreement in 1993 known as &quot;The order of RU top-level domain administration&quot;. According to the agreement, administrative and technical support responsibilities for the .ru domain were to be handed over to RIPN. In 2002, the administrative functions were handed over to CC for TLD RU.

== Development of .ru ==
The ccTLD is developing rapidly under self-regulation. In 1993, an informal union was formed, known as the RU Top-Level Domain Coordination Group (RU TLD CG). The union includes the leading Russian ISPs as well as scientific and educational networks entrusted by RIPN with RU domain administration.

In 1998, RIPN and RU TLD CG established a domain registration association. Subsequently, in 2000, a new system of domain name registration for .ru was introduced. It was a distributed system of second-level domain name registrations in .ru, through accredited registrars. The accredited registrars provide domain name registration and support services on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis to end-users.

RIPN became one of four co-founders of CC for TLD RU, but continued to support centralized technical aspects of the operation of .ru. All organizational and administrative functions were handed over to CC for TLD RU. To preserve historical continuity, one of CC for TLD RU&#x27;s committees was established on the basis of RU TLD CG.

CC for TLD RU maintains domain name registration rules for .ru, the registrar accreditation procedure, and promotes perspective projects that involve the growth of .ru, whereas RIPN secures .ru technical base functions and supports DNS for the .ru DNS zone.

The current distributed registration system was first tested in 2001 and implemented in 2005.

== Second-level domains ==

<text>.rw is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Rwanda.

==Second-level domains==

In addition to registering a Rwanda domain name directly under .rw, RICTA, through accredited and registered registrars, offers as well the following second level domains:

== History ==
The .rw country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Rwanda was created around 1996. It was managed and operated under a Swiss company by a Belgian entrepreneur named Frédéric Grégoire. In 2005, the Rwanda Internet Community and Technology Alliance (RICTA) started a legal process to retain the domain name and operate it locally in Rwanda. They were finally able to achieve this in 2012.

<text>.in is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for India. It was introduced in May 1989. It is currently administered by the National Internet Exchange of India.

==Registry operator==
The domain was originally managed by the National Centre for Software Technology (NCST) and its Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). The Government of India issued an executive order in 2004 to transfer responsibility for managing .in domains to the newly created INRegistry under the authority of the National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI). The National Informatics Centre (NIC), ERNET, and the Ministry of Defence were appointed as registrars for the gov.in, res.in and ac.in, and the mil.in domains respectively.

In August 2018, NIXI appointed Neustar Data Infotech (India), a subsidiary of Neustar Inc, to be the country&#x27;s new registry services provider. Neustar completed migration of existing .in domains to its registry infrastructure in March 2019. Neustar added the ability to register Indian-language domains in native script by enabling end-to-end web portal language support.

== Second-level domains ==
, liberalised policies for the domain allow unlimited second-level registrations under . Unlimited registrations under the previously structured existing zones are also allowed:

* (available to anyone; used by companies, individuals, and organisations in India)
* (intended for banks, registered companies, and trademarks)
* (available to anyone; used by companies, individuals, and organisations in India)
* (intended for shops, partnerships, liaison offices, sole proprietorships)
* (intended for Internet service providers)
* (intended for nonprofit organisations)
* (intended for general/miscellaneous use)
* (intended for individuals)

Zones reserved for use by qualified institutions in India:
* (Older, for both educational and research institutes)
* (Academic institutions)
* (Educational institutions)
* (Indian research institutes)
* (Indian government)
* (Indian military organisations)

The domain is reserved for India&#x27;s National Informatics Centre, but in practice most Indian government agencies have domains ending in .

The .in registry launched following sub-domains on Oct 29, 2021 to benefit the growing market:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
*

Before the introduction of liberalised registration policies for the domain, only 7000 names had been registered between 1992 and 2004. , the number had increased to over 610,000 domain names with 60% of registrations coming from India and the rest from overseas. By October 2011, the number had surpassed 1 million domain names. , the number has more than doubled to over 2 million domain names.
== Restrictions on use of .in domains ==
As per the terms and conditions of the registry, domain privacy is not allowed.

Recently updated EKYC guidelines were issued to all registrars to authenticate new registrants. Hence, the previous rule relating to bulk booking of .in domain names has been withdrawn. Now customers can book unlimited .in domain names as previously in line with promoting .in TLD on par with other popular TLDs like .com and others which also has no restrictions relating to bulk booking.

== Internationalised domain names and country codes ==
India plans to introduce internationalised domain names in the 22 local languages used in the country. , fifteen of these internationalised domain names were accepted by ICANN:

* (Devanagari), became available with the following zones:
* (Bengali), available 
* (Gurmukhī), only ਡਾਟਾਮੇਲ.ਭਾਰਤ 
* (Gujarati), available 
* (Tamil), available 
* (Telugu), available 
* (Urdu) only ڈاٹامیل.بھارت (mainly right-to-left character order)

In 2016, an application for eight further domains was accepted. While the Indian government also applied for .বাংলা (Bengali), it was given to a competing applicant, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited (BTCL).These domains were not available (): But, they were later on made available and now are open for domain registration in India.

Although born in the United States, he lived his first 18 years in the Cayman Islands. Originally he represented the Cayman Islands, then the United States, and then from 1999 the Cayman Islands again.

Competing for the Rice Owls track and field program, he won two NCAA titles in the long jump.

Two times in the role, he was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the
most outstanding athlete of the 1989 CARIFTA Games and 1990 CARIFTA Games.

In the 2004 Summer Olympics, he participated in the 100 metres, achieving a second place and a season&#x27;s best time in the heat from which he qualified, before exiting the competition in the second round with a fifth-placed finish. In the long jump competition, he did not qualify for the final.

<text>The Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) .io is nominally assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory. The domain is managed by Internet Computer Bureau Ltd, a domain name registry, with registrar services provided by Name.com.

==History==
The .io domain was delegated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to British entrepreneur Paul Kane in 1997 together with the ccTLDs .ac (Ascension Island), .sh (St Helena), and .tm (Turkmenistan). Kane operated them for private benefit under the trade name &quot;Internet Computer Bureau&quot; from 1997 until 2017. In 2014, Kane claimed that &quot;profits are distributed to the authorities for them to operate services as they see fit&quot; and that &quot;Each of the overseas territories has an account and the funds are deposited there because obviously the territories have expenses that they incur and it’s offsetting that.&quot; However the UK government has repeatedly stated that this is untrue: “There is no agreement between the UK Government and ICB regarding the administration of the .io domain” and &quot;the Government receives no revenues from the sales or administration of this domain.&quot;
The first subdomain was registered under .IO in 1998, when Levi Strauss &amp; Co. registered the domain levi.io.

In April 2017, Paul Kane sold the Internet Computer Bureau holding company to privately held domain name registry services provider Afilias for $70.17m in cash.

In July 2017, a security issue with the .io domain occurred when a security researcher managed to take control of four of the seven authoritative name servers for the domain, which potentially would have given them control of all the DNS traffic for the domain.

In December 2020, Afilias&#x27; owner Hal Lubsen sold it to privately held Donuts for an undisclosed sum.

One month later, in January 2021, Donuts was acquired by private equity firm Ethos Capital, again for an undisclosed sum.

In 2021, the United Nations&#x27; International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that the United Kingdom has no sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, and that sovereignty instead belongs to Mauritius. This would extinguish the British Indian Ocean Territory, and the IO ISO-3166 two-letter country code and .io domain could also be extinguished. The United Kingdom, which was not a party to the case, disputes and does not recognise the tribunal&#x27;s decision, so further legal processes are likely. In 2022, the Mauritian government was considering how to progress with the issue. In October 2024, the UK announced that it would hand over sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius once a treaty is finalised.

In July 2021, the Chagos Refugees Group UK submitted a complaint to the Irish government against domain-name speculators Paul Kane and Afilias, seeking repatriation of the .IO (&quot;Indian Ocean&quot;) country-code top-level domain and payment of back royalties from the $7m/year in revenue generated by the domain. While attempts to repatriate top-level domains are not uncommon, this one is notable in that it cites consumer and human rights violations of the OECD&#x27;s 2011 Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises rather than multistakeholder representation under ICANN policy, and because the .io domain has enjoyed commercial success, particularly among cryptocurrency companies, with more than 270,000 domains registered.

=== Possible phasing out ===

In October 2024, the United Kingdom announced that it would eventually cede the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius, while maintaining the military base on Diego Garcia via an initial 99-year lease. After the transfer, current IANA rules may require the .io domain to be phased out, which would take at least 5 years. This depends on whether IO is removed from the ISO 3166-1 standard. Historically, some exceptions have been granted, as was the case for .su. The deal was put on hold following the 2024 United States presidential election to allow consideration from the new incoming administration.

==Registration and restrictions==
Individuals and organisations are allowed to register .io domains.

Labels for .io domains may only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and must be between 3 and 63 characters long. Domain names cannot begin or end with a hyphen symbol, and may not contain two consecutive hyphens. The entire domain name may not contain more than 253 characters.

Applicants for the registration of .io domains do not need to be registered or established in the British Indian Ocean Territory. Third-level domains, such as &quot;xyz.com.io&quot;, can only be registered by an inhabitant of the area. (Since there are no legal, permanent inhabitants of the British Indian Ocean Territory, theoretically no third-level domains will be registered.) Any second-level domains used by NIC.IO and top-level domains cannot be used as a third-level domain. For example, the domains &quot;com.com.io&quot;, &quot;org.com.io&quot;, and &quot;biz.com.io&quot; are all restricted.

Domain names in .io may not be used, &quot;for any purpose that is sexual or pornographic or that is against the statutory laws of any nation.&quot; If this requirement is breached, &quot;NIC.IO reserves the right to immediately deactivate the offending registration.&quot;

.io domains may be registered for a minimum of one year, and a maximum of 5 years.

Domain names in .io are priced higher than those in many other TLDs. Registering an available .io-domain currently () costs US$36 per year.

==Usage==

The .io domain is used almost exclusively for purposes unrelated to the British Indian Ocean Territory.

In computer science, &quot;IO&quot; or &quot;I/O&quot; is commonly used as an abbreviation for input/output, which makes the .io domain desirable for services that want to be associated with technology. .io domains are often used for open source projects, application programming interfaces (&quot;APIs&quot;), startup companies, browser games, and other online services.

The TLD is also used for domain hacks, as the letters &quot;io&quot; are an ending of many English terms. For example, Rub.io is a shortened URL that was used for the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign of Marco Rubio.

One reason given for the TLD&#x27;s popularity is that it stands out by being shorter than other TLDs. Also, the .io TLD is less occupied than other TLDs, so it is more likely that a given term is available there.

Google&#x27;s ad targeting treats .io as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted.&quot;

===.io games===

The rapid rise of &quot;Agar.io&quot; (2015) and &quot;Slither.io&quot; (2016) led to the beginning of a new genre of browser games, dubbed &quot;.io games&quot; for the domain name they use. Characterised by simple graphics and gameplay in a free for all multiplayer arena, .io games received around 192 million visits in 2017. Many .io shooters launched after &quot;Slither.io&quot;Valadares released &quot;Diep.io&quot; in July 2016. Miniclip also began developing new .io games.

==Controversy==
According to a 2014 Gigaom interview with Paul Kane, then chairman of the Internet Computer Bureau, the domain name registry is required to give some of its profits to the British government, for administration of the British Indian Ocean Territory. After being questioned as a result of the interview, the British Government denied receiving any funds from the sale of .io domain names, and argued that consequently, the profits could not be shared with the Chagossians, the former inhabitants forcibly removed by the British government. Kane, however, contradicted the government&#x27;s denial.

<text>Leonard (&quot;Leo&quot;) Myles-Mills (born 9 May 1973 in Accra, Greater Accra Region) is a Ghanaian former athlete who specialized in the 100 metres. He ran a personal best of 9.98 seconds for the event in 1998, becoming the first Ghanaian to break the 10-second barrier. His best of 6.45 seconds for the 60 metres is an African record. Myles-Mills twice represented his country at the Summer Olympics and also at the Commonwealth Games. He was a two-time NCAA Men&#x27;s 100 m dash champion while running for Brigham Young University.

His brother John Myles-Mills was also a sprint athlete.

He has won a gold medal at the 1999 All-Africa Games, a silver medal at the 2003 All-Africa Games and a bronze medal at the 1998 African Championships. In 1999 he set a new African indoor record in 60 metres with 6.45 seconds. His personal best over 100 metres; 9.98 seconds was a Ghanaian record until Benjamin Azamati broke it by running a time of 9.97 seconds in 100 meters at the Texas relays on 26 March 2021.

Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he achieved a third place in the 100 metres, thus securing qualification from his heat in a season&#x27;s best time. Entering the second round, he managed to qualify through to the semi-final, following a third place in the race and recording a further improvement upon his season&#x27;s best. He finished the semi-final in sixth place, thus failing to secure qualification to the final.

Myles-Mills is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>.is (dot is) is the top-level domain for Iceland. The country code is derived from the first two letters of &quot;&quot;, which is the Icelandic word for Iceland. Registration of .is domains is open to all people and companies without any special restriction.

The first .is domain, hi.is, is the domain of (University of Iceland). It was registered on December 11, 1986, making it one of the earliest ever domain registrations on the Internet. The domain is managed by ISNIC, a private corporation.

According to McAfee report &quot;Mapping the Mal Web,&quot; &quot;.is&quot; was evaluated as one of the top 10 most secure TLDs in the world in the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. No report has come out since then. , there were just over 91,000 .is domains registered.

, .is domains can be registered for up to five years.

==Domain suspensions==
In April 2013, ISNIC briefly hosted The Pirate Bay&#x27;s domain &quot;ThePirateBay.is.&quot;

In 2014, ISNIC suspended two domains which hosted material produced by the Islamic State, including &quot;Khilafah.is&quot;.

In September 2017, ISNIC briefly hosted American neo-Nazi domain &quot;dailystormer.is&quot;, which had been removed by several domain Registries around the world. It was pulled from its .is domain after its publisher did not fulfill the standard procedure of disclosing his address.

In September 2022, ISNIC suspended the .is domain for Kiwi Farms, a controversial internet trolling and harassment forum.

<text>.it is the national top-level domain (ccTLD) assigned to Italy.

Registration is open to organisations and individuals of legal age who are citizens or residents of/headquartered in the countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), the Vatican State, the Republic of San Marino and the Swiss Confederation.

Since 11 July 2012, .it has also supported internationalised domain names.

==History==
The first .it domain requested was that of the CNR (National Research Council: cnuce.cnr.it); the request was sent on 23 December 1987, and the domain became active on 1 January 1988. On 23 December 1987, IANA assigned the .it ccTLD to CNUCE, an institute of the CNR in Pisa, and the first name registered was that of the CNR&#x27;s CNUCE. In 1997, the task was passed on to the Institute for Telematic Applications (Istituto per le Applicazioni Telematiche, IAT), also at the CNR in Pisa, which was born out of the necessary expansion of the &#x27;Research Network Infrastructure Department&#x27; (Reparto Infrastrutture Reti per la Ricerca, RIRR) of the CNUCE.
Policies and rules were agreed with operators in the sector using a variety of forms. After the setting-up of the initial group, called MAIL-ITA, followed by ITA-PE 162 (which held its meetings at the CSELT) in 1994, 1998 saw the establishment of the Italian Naming Authority, which was responsible for drafting the rules for assigning &#x27;.it&#x27; domains until 2005. This structure differed from the Italian Registration Authority, which was responsible for keeping the Registry of names and made available the technical infrastructure needed to maintain it, thereby also including the management of authoritative DNS delegations. In 1999, the Naming Authority carried out a &#x27;liberalisation&#x27; of the ccTLD by removing the limit on the number of domain names that could be registered for organisations of any kind. In the same year, management of the Registry passed to the Institute&#x27;s Director Franco Denoth. 
In 2001, a merger of several institutes of the CNR gave rise to the Institute of Informatics and Telematics, which consequently took over responsibility. In 2004, the limit on the number of registrations was also removed for natural persons. As of 2005, the Registry took over both regulatory and implementation functions with the establishment of an internal committee (the Steering Committee) that included representatives of the sector&#x27;s operators. In 2009, the &#x27;.it&#x27; ccTLD Registry changed its name to Registro .it, the registry of Italian domains.
Following Denoth&#x27;s death in April 2006, the direction of the Institute (and thus of Registro) was temporarily taken over by Enrico Gregori on 17 May 2006, followed by Domenico Laforenza in 2008 and Marco Conti in 2019. Currently, the Institute is directed by Andrea Passarella.
Since 11 July 2012, it has also been possible to register .it domains with non-ASCII characters (IDN), i.e., special characters, accented letters, etc.

==Reserved and/or special-use second-level domains==
Second-level domains are the ones &#x27;before&#x27; the .it, and can be of different types:
*.gov.it is the official second-level domain for the Government and Public Administration.
*.edu.it is the official second-level domain for educational institutions (schools, universities, etc.). 
*.difesa.it is the official second-level domain for the Italian Armed Forces (excluding the Carabinieri).
*.esteri.it is the official second-level domain for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Italian diplomatic and consular representatives.
*Domain names corresponding to provinces (e.g., palermo.it) and their acronyms (pa.it), municipalities, regions, etc. cannot be assigned; they are defined as geographical domains. It is possible to register third-level domains within them, e.g., comune.palermo.it is the domain assigned to the municipality of Palermo, while regione.lazio.it is the domain assigned to the regional government of Lazio. The second-level domain .co.it does not refer to business activities (as is often the case in other countries) but to the regional extension of the province of Como.
*There are domains reserved exclusively for government bodies, such as italia.it, italy.it, italie.it, etc.

<doc id="1113883" wikidata="Q7404709" url="?curid=1113883" title="Saline Valley">
<text>Saline Valley is a large, deep, and arid graben, about in length, in the northern Mojave Desert of California, a narrow, northwest–southeast-trending tectonic sink defined by fault-block mountains. Most of it became a part of Death Valley National Park when the park was expanded in 1994. This area had previously been administered by the Bureau of Land Management. It is located northwest of Death Valley proper, south of Eureka Valley, and east of the Owens Valley. The valley&#x27;s lowest elevations are about and it lies in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada range, plus the Inyo Mountains bordering the valley on the west.

==Natural features==

A large dry lake occupies the center of the valley. The west end of the lake supports a salt marsh, which contains a variety of plant and animal life. The marsh is fed by a perennial stream from Hunter Canyon. North of the lake is a large area of low and sweeping sand dunes.

There are a number of hot springs in the northeast corner of the valley. The water temperature at the source of these springs averages at . Saline Valley&#x27;s three main warm springs are reached by a primary road known as the Warm Springs Road or Painted Rock Road.

Lower Warm Springs is the largest, most developed, and most popular dispersed camping area. Palm Spring is smaller and less crowded with great views of Saline Valley and the source feeds two tubs known as Wizard Pool and Volcano Pool. Upper Warm Spring, the smallest and least disturbed of the main springs, is a deep pool of lukewarm azure water surrounded by cattail, arrow-weed, and grasses, in full view of the Saline Range.

Saline Valley is a closed or endorheic basin. If filled with water it would be over deep, form a lake with a surface area of roughly , and hold approximately of water.

==History==
Saline Valley was inhabited by the Ko&#x27;ongkatün Band of Timbisha Shoshone (also known as Panamint or Koso). One of their principal villages was known as &quot;Ko&#x27;on&quot; and located in Saline Valley, therefore the valley was named after the village and known as Ko&#x27;ongkatün (&quot;Ko&#x27;on&quot; + &quot;kantün&quot; - &quot;possessing, characterized by&quot; the village Ko&#x27;on) or simply Ko&#x27;on. The Timbisha Shoshone living at &quot;Ko&#x27;on&quot; were called Ko&#x27;ontsi (″People of the village Ko&#x27;on&quot;). The village was abandoned in the early 20th century and the inhabitants moved to Darwin, California.

Saline Valley was a significant mineral source in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Conn and Trudo Borax Company mined borax from the salt marsh from 1874 to 1895. The remains of this site can be seen today as a few shallow pits near Saline Valley Road. Salt mining began in 1903 at the south end of the lake, and continued into the 1930s.
An electric aerial tram was constructed in 1911 to carry the salt over the Inyo Mountains to a terminus northeast of Keeler, California in the Owens Valley. It operated sporadically from 1913 to 1936, but ultimately proved to be too expensive to run. The tram, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, was the steepest ever constructed in the United States. It rose from an elevation of in Saline Valley to over the mountains, and then down to . Route was south from Salt Lake to Daisy Canyon then southwest and terminated at the Southern Pacific RR between Dolomite and Swansea. In recent years it has been badly damaged by vandals.

As early as the 1960s, the hot springs in the valley became popular among nudists, and were eventually improved by volunteer labor, to include concrete tubs, a shower, a sink, and three outhouses (which the Park Service later replaced with concrete-lined latrines). For improved access, two airstrips were built, the &quot;Chicken Strip&quot; and &quot;Tail-Dragger Strip&quot; (the latter is now closed).

The Saline Valley Warm Springs, as they are called, have become controversial in recent years. The improvements would have violated Park Service policy if they had taken place today. There has been compromise so far; a park host is always on duty, visitors are limited to 30 days per year, and the springs do not appear on any official NPS map. The campgrounds retain a clothing-optional policy which the park has taken no official stance on. As stated in the 2019 Saline Valley Warm Springs Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement, &quot;Public nudity is common at the site, and the plan is silent on this topic. Public nudity is not against Federal regulations, but lewd behavior is.&quot;
There are 3 sections of springs, the upper, middle and lower springs. The middle and lower springs have been developed with concrete soaking tubs and showers are present. The upper spring is in an undeveloped natural state. In late 2005, seismic activity disturbed the flow of water to the lower springs. The only functional section remaining after that was the middle springs. However, the flow appears to be returning to the lower springs. As of early 2007, flow is estimated to be about 50% of what it was before the earthquake, and is increasing, making both springs functional.
==Military use==

Low-flying jet aircraft have long been common in the valley. The airspace over the valley is part of the US military&#x27;s vast R-2508 Special Use Airspace complex. The Saline Military operations area (MOA) covers the entire valley south to Hunter Mountain from 200&#x27; AGL up to FL180 with an ATCAA located over the same area extending from FL180 up to FL600. The airspace is used by military aircraft primarily from Nellis AFB, Edwards AFB, NAWS China Lake, and NAS Lemoore for high and low altitude mission training. Military aircraft utilize radio communications on either 256.8 MHz or 123.95 MHz while operating in the Saline MOA; however, military aircraft throughout the R-2508 complex often use 315.9 MHz when conducting low altitude operations below 1500&#x27; AGL.

In December 2003, Edwards Air Force Base completed an environmental assessment for proposed construction and operation of a radar system and microwave repeater facility in the valley. The assessment&#x27;s conclusion is that:

<text>&quot;The Deadly Years&quot; is the twelfth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by David P. Harmon and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast December 8, 1967.

In the episode, strange radiation causes members of the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to age rapidly.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; is ferrying a senior officer, Commodore Stocker, to Starbase 10 where he is due to assume command. On the way, the ship makes a stop at planet Gamma Hydra IV to resupply the research station there. A landing party consisting of Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott, navigator Ensign Chekov, and Lieutenant Arlene Galway beam down to the facility. The station seems completely deserted, until Ensign Chekov discovers the body of a man who apparently has died of old age, and panics. Robert Johnson, a member of the station crew, appears with his wife Elaine. Both claim to be in their late 20s, yet appear 50 years older. The two soon die in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; sickbay.

Mr. Spock and civilian scientist Dr. Janet Wallace begin an investigation. Their only clue is a comet that passed Gamma Hydra IV recently. Soon the landing party, with the exception of Chekov, begin to age rapidly as well. Lt. Galway ages most rapidly and soon dies. By now they have learned that the comet gave off low-level radiation that most likely caused the aging effect.

As Kirk continues to age, he becomes increasingly forgetful, including ordering the use of an obsolete code despite having recently been told the code had been broken by the Romulans. This leads Commodore Stocker to order Spock to convene a hearing, in which Kirk is found unfit to command. With Spock also afflicted, Stocker assumes command, and orders a direct course to Starbase 10, ignoring warnings that this will take the ship through the Romulan neutral zone.

Meanwhile, Kirk, McCoy, and Spock discuss Chekov&#x27;s immunity to the affliction. Remembering Chekov&#x27;s fright at the discovery of the dead body, McCoy surmises that Chekov&#x27;s increased adrenaline levels may have had some effect, and recalls that adrenaline had once shown promise as a treatment for radiation sickness. Mr. Spock and Dr. Wallace, assisted by Nurse Chapel, begin work on an adrenaline-based compound to test on the landing party.

As &quot;Enterprise&quot; enters the neutral zone, Romulan vessels attack, ignoring all attempts at contact. Stocker, having no field command experience and paralyzed with indecision, considers surrendering, but is reminded that Romulans do not take prisoners. In sickbay, Spock announces that the drug is ready, warning that it may kill as well as cure. Kirk insists on taking the first injection. The drug reverses the aging effect, and Kirk races to the bridge to relieve Stocker.

Kirk bluffs the Romulans by sending a message to Starfleet Command, deliberately using the broken code, warning that &quot;Enterprise&quot; will self-destruct using the &quot;corbomite device&quot;, which will also destroy any nearby ships. The Romulans move to a safe distance, giving &quot;Enterprise&quot; room to make a surprise escape.

==Production and reception==
DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy) said of the make-up used in this episode, &quot;I only worked half days on that show because I was in makeup the other half. I&#x27;d sit in the chair for a while, then I&#x27;d take a break, go to the john, come back and they&#x27;d work some more. It was a tremendous makeup effort. There were three makeup men working on me all the time, on my hands and on my face. Leonard [Nimoy] was lucky on that show. He was blessed by the fact that Vulcans don&#x27;t age as fast as humans.&quot;

Critic Darren Mooney notes that the aging in the episode focuses on the negative, physical process, and none of the grace and enjoyment of life&#x27;s accomplishments. Part of this focus on the physical aspects of aging came from associate producer Robert Justman&#x27;s notes to producer Gene Coon where he details the steps of Kirk&#x27;s aging.

Zack Handlen of &quot; The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &quot;B−&quot; rating, noting the focus on the physical aspects of aging, saying, &quot;Nobody learns a valuable lesson about how getting old is just a natural part of life.&quot;

==Sequel==
An episode of the &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; series, created by fans of the series, called &quot;To Serve All My Days&quot; is a sequel to this episode. The screenplay was written by D. C. Fontana and stars Walter Koenig as a rapidly aging Chekov.

<doc id="1113886" wikidata="Q5703529" url="?curid=1113886" title="Helena Brewers">
<text>The Helena Brewers were a Minor League Baseball team in the Pioneer League located in Helena, Montana, from 1978 to 2018. The team played their home games at Kindrick Legion Field, which was built in 1939. They were affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers (1985–2000, 2003–2018) and Philadelphia Phillies (1978–1983).

Among the best-known players to play in Helena are Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg, who started his career with the Phillies in Helena, Gary Sheffield, who started his career with the Helena Gold Sox in 1986, Jeff Cirillo and Mark Loretta who began their careers with the 1991 and 1993 Helena Brewers, respectively; and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun.

==History==
The Helena Phillies joined the Pioneer League in 1978, giving Helena a professional baseball team for the first time in 64 years. In 1984, the Helena Gold Sox won the Pioneer League Championship, a rarity for an independent club. The team hooked on with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1985 and changed its name to the Helena Brewers in 1987. Helena won the league championship in back-to-back seasons in 1995 and 1996. The franchise moved to Provo, Utah, as the Provo Angels after the 2000 season. In 2003, the Medicine Hat Blue Jays moved to Helena, and the team once again became a Brewers affiliate. 

The franchise left Helena for Colorado Springs, Colorado, after the 2018 season, where it would play as the Rocky Mountain Vibes.

<doc id="1113889" wikidata="Q2063204" url="?curid=1113889" title="Crown Heights riot">
<text>The Crown Heights riot was a race riot that took place from August 19 to August 21, 1991, in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York City. Black residents attacked Orthodox Jewish residents, damaged their homes, and looted businesses. The riots began on August 19, 1991, after two 7 year-old children of Guyanese immigrants were unintentionally struck by a driver running a red light while following the motorcade of Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of Chabad, a Jewish religious movement. One child died and the second was severely injured.

In the immediate aftermath of the fatal crash, black youths attacked several Jews on the street, seriously injuring several and killing an Orthodox Jewish student from Australia. Over the next three days, black rioters looted stores and attacked Jewish homes. Two weeks after the riot, a non-Jewish man was killed by a group of black men; some believed that the victim had been mistaken for a Jew. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor David Dinkins, an African American. Opponents of Dinkins said that he failed to contain the riots, with many calling them a &#x27;pogrom&#x27; to emphasize what was seen as the complicity of New York City political leaders.

Ultimately, black and Jewish leaders developed an outreach program between their communities to help calm and possibly improve racial relations in Crown Heights over the next decade.

==Causes==
===Car crash===
At approximately 8:20 p.m. on Monday, August 19, 1991, Yosef Lifsh, 22, was driving a station wagon with three passengers west on President Street, part of the three-car motorcade of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement. The procession was led by an unmarked police car with two officers, with its rooftop light flashing.

The police car and Schneerson&#x27;s automobile crossed Utica Avenue on a green light and proceeded along President Street at a normal speed, but Lifsh&#x27;s vehicle had fallen behind. Not wishing to lose sight of Schneerson&#x27;s car, Lifsh crossed Utica Avenue on a red light. There was no indication of the exact speed of his vehicle. Lifsh&#x27;s vehicle struck a car being driven on Utica Avenue, veered onto the sidewalk, knocked a 600-pound (275 kg) stone building pillar down and pinned two children against an iron grate covering the window of a first-floor apartment in a four-story brick building (). Seven-year-old Gavin Cato, the son of Guyanese immigrants, who was working on his bicycle chain while on the sidewalk near his apartment on President Street, died instantly. His seven-year-old cousin Angela Cato, who was playing nearby, survived but was severely injured.

Lifsh believed he had the right of way to proceed through the intersection because of the police escort. Lifsh said he deliberately steered his car away from adults on the sidewalk, toward the wall, a distance of about , in order to stop the car. Lifsh later said that the car did not come to a full stop when it hit the building but slid to the left along the wall and hit the children.

===Death of Gavin Cato===
Accounts differ as to the next sequence of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that the first thing he did was to try to lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. Members of the Hatzolah EMS unit, who arrived on the scene about three minutes after the crash, said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23 p.m., followed by police and a City ambulance. The latter took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32 p.m.; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.

Two attending police officers, as well as a technician from the City ambulance, directed the Hatzolah driver to remove Lifsh from the scene for his safety, while Gavin Cato was being removed from beneath the station wagon. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, more than 250 neighborhood residents, mostly black teenagers, many of whom were shouting &quot;Jews! Jews! Jews!&quot;, jeered the driver of the car and turned their anger on the police.

Some members of the community were outraged because Lifsh was taken from the scene by a private ambulance service while city emergency workers were still trying to free the children who were pinned under the car. Some believed that Gavin Cato died because the Hatzolah ambulance crew was unwilling to help non-Jews. There was a rumor at the time that Lifsh was intoxicated. A breath alcohol test administered by police within 70 minutes of the crash indicated this was not the case. 

Later that evening, as the crowds and rumors grew, people threw bottles and rocks. Someone reportedly shouted, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Kingston Avenue and get a Jew!&quot; A number of black youths set off westward toward Kingston Avenue ( away from Utica Avenue), a street of predominantly Jewish residents several blocks away, vandalizing cars, and throwing rocks and bottles as they went.

==Riots and murders==
===Yankel Rosenbaum killing===
About three hours after the riots began, early on the morning of August 20, a group of approximately 20 young black men, with the incitement of Charles Price, who chanted &quot;Let&#x27;s go get a Jew,&quot; surrounded Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Jewish University of Melbourne student in the United States conducting research for his doctorate. They stabbed him several times in the back and beat him severely, fracturing his skull. Before being taken to the hospital, Rosenbaum identified 16-year-old Lemrick Nelson Jr. as his assailant in a line-up shown to him by the police. Rosenbaum died later that night because the doctor did not notice a stab wound in his chest. Nelson was charged with murder as an adult; he was acquitted at trial.

Following that trial, Australian attorney Norman Rosenbaum became an advocate for his late brother, inspiring protests that included a shutdown of the Brooklyn Bridge and a demonstration at Gracie Mansion, the mayor&#x27;s official residence.

In 1997, Nelson and Price were both convicted in federal court of violating Rosenbaum&#x27;s civil rights resulting in his death. After the judge ruled that the two men had committed second degree murder, Nelson was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison, while Price was sentenced to nearly 22 years in prison. However, that verdict was vacated on appeal due to unfairness in the jury selection process. A retrial was held in 2003. There were two primary issues of contention: whether Nelson&#x27;s actions had been motivated by prejudice and whether Nelson&#x27;s actions caused Rosenbaum&#x27;s death.

Nelson later was convicted in federal court of violating Rosenbaum&#x27;s civil rights. He eventually admitted that he had stabbed Rosenbaum but was acquitted of having caused Rosenbaum&#x27;s death. Nelson received the statutory maximum of 10 years in prison. In 2002, Charles Price pleaded guilty to civil rights violations resulting in Rosenbaum&#x27;s death. He was sentenced to 11 years and six months in prison.

===Rioting===
For three days following the crash, numerous African Americans and Caribbean Americans of the neighborhood, joined by growing numbers of non-residents, rioted in Crown Heights. In the rioting of the ensuing three days, according to Edward Shapiro, many of the rioters &quot;did not even live in Crown Heights.&quot;

During the riots, Jews were injured, stores were looted, and cars and homes were damaged. The rioters identified Jewish homes by the mezuzot affixed to the front doors.

An additional 350 police officers were added to the regular duty roster on August 20 and were assigned to Crown Heights in an attempt to quell the rioting. After episodes of rock- and bottle-throwing involving hundreds of blacks and Jews, and after groups of blacks marched through Crown Heights chanting &quot;No Justice, No Peace!&quot;, &quot;Death to the Jews!&quot;, and &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot;, an additional 1,200 police officers were sent to confront rioters in Crown Heights.

On the third day of the disturbances, Al Sharpton and Sonny Carson led a march. The marchers proceeded through Crown Heights carrying antisemitic signs and burning an Israeli flag. Rioters threw bricks and bottles at police; shots were fired at police and police cars were pelted and overturned, including the Police Commissioner&#x27;s car.

Riots escalated to the extent that a detachment of 200 police officers was overwhelmed and had to retreat for their safety. On August 22, over 1,800 police officers, including mounted and motorcycle units, had been dispatched to stop the attacks on people and property.

By the time the three days of rioting ended, 152 police officers and 38 civilians were injured, 27 vehicles were destroyed, seven stores were looted or burned, and 225 cases of robbery and burglary were committed. At least 129 arrests were made during the riots, including 122 blacks and seven whites. Property damage was estimated at one million dollars.

===Related shooting murder===
On September 5, two weeks after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales representative with a white beard dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11 p.m., six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi&#x27;s family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D&#x27;Amato, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number of advocacy organizations, that Graziosi&#x27;s resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder. The New York Police Department, Mayor Dinkins, newspaper columnist Mike McAlary, and the U.S. Justice Department did not agree. The murder was not treated as a hate crime.

==Viewpoints==
After the death of Gavin Cato, members of the black community believed that the decision to remove Lifsh from the scene first was racially motivated. They also said that this was one example of a perceived system of preferential treatment afforded to Jews in Crown Heights, and referred to the riot as an &#x27;uprising&#x27;. (Some Jews referred to the riot as a &#x27;pogrom&#x27;; see ). The preferential treatment was reported to include biased actions by law enforcement and uneven allocations of government resources, amongst others. Many members of the black community were concerned that the number of Jews in the community had increased and that they were buying all of the property in the crowded area.

An interview with Shmuel Butman, published in 1991, mentions a police directive to Hatzolah to transport Lifsh, along with Jews already injured by rioters, without transporting either of the Cato children. &quot;We did exactly what the police officers wisely advised us.&quot; Based on protesters&#x27; statements and actions during the rioting, Butman said, &quot;We were always hoping that after World War II no Jew would ever be killed just for being Jewish, but this is what happened in the city of New York.&quot; In his eulogy at the funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton referred to &quot;diamond merchants&quot; and said, &quot;It&#x27;s an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights.&quot;

A writer for &quot;City Journal&quot; criticized the news media for downplaying the role of antisemitism in the riots, noting various antisemitic displays, such as a banner displayed at the funeral of Cato that said, &quot;Hitler did not do the job&quot;. Edward S. Shapiro, a historian at Seton Hall University, later described the riot as &quot;the most serious anti-Semitic incident in American history&quot; and published a book about it in 2006. He notes that there are many interpretations of what happened:

==Court case==
A grand jury composed of 10 black, eight white, and five Hispanic jurors found no cause to indict Lifsh. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes explained that under New York law, the single act of &quot;losing control of a car&quot; is not criminal negligence, even if death or injury resulted. Lifsh waived immunity and testified before the grand jury. About an hour after hearing Lifsh&#x27;s testimony, the grand jury voted not to indict him. Subsequently, Lifsh moved to Israel, where his family lives, because he claimed his life was threatened. In Israel, Lifsh settled in the Lubavitch village of Kfar Chabad.

Afterwards, Hynes fought unsuccessfully for the public release of the testimony that the grand jury had heard. His lawsuit was dismissed, and the judge noted that more than three-quarters of the witnesses who had been contacted refused to waive their right to privacy. The judge also expressed concern for the witnesses&#x27; safety.

==Aftermath==

===Impact on the 1993 mayoral race===

The Crown Heights riot contributed to the defeat of David Dinkins in his second mayoral bid. He was attacked by many political adversaries in his reelection bid, including vocal proponents of &quot;Black nationalism, back-to-Africa, economic radicalism, and racial exclusiveness.&quot;

====Girgenti Report====
On November 17, 1992, New York Governor Mario Cuomo gave the Director of Criminal Justice Services, Richard H. Girgenti, the authority to investigate the rioting and the Nelson trial. The &quot;Girgenti Report&quot; was compiled by over 40 lawyers and investigators. The 656-page document, dated July 1993, is available through a website of the Washington, DC–based Police Foundation, which prefaces the report with a disclaimer that the &quot;review does not seek to put blame on any entity for what happened...&quot;

The report was extremely critical of Police Commissioner Lee Brown. The report also criticized Mayor Dinkins for poor handling of the riots. However, the report found no evidence to support the most severe charge against Dinkins and Brown: that they had purposely delayed the police response in order to allow rioters to &quot;vent&quot; their rage.

The first night of the riot, Dinkins, along with Police Commissioner Brown, both African Americans, went to Crown Heights to talk to the community to dispel the rumors about the circumstances surrounding the crash. They had no appreciable influence on the rioters, most of whom were young black men.

In a 16-minute speech on the Thanksgiving holiday following the riot, Dinkins rebutted allegations that he had prevented police from protecting citizens in Crown Heights. The Jewish community believed Dinkins failed to contain the riot and failed to exercise his responsibility, to their detriment.

====Use of the term &#x27;pogrom&#x27;====
The Crown Heights riot was an important issue that was raised repeatedly on the campaign trail in the 1993 mayoral election. According to Edward S. Shapiro, politicians opposed to Mayor Dinkins used the word &#x27;pogrom&#x27; to characterize the riot in order to discredit the mayor&#x27;s response to the riot, writing &quot;the controversy over how to define the Crown Heights riot was not merely an issue of semantics.&quot;

Rudy Giuliani, who would be elected as the next mayor of New York, referred to the Crown Heights riot as a &#x27;pogrom&#x27; on July 1, 1993, in a speech at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn: &quot;You can use whatever word you want, but in fact for three days people were beaten up, people were sent to the hospital because they were Jewish. There&#x27;s no question that not enough was done about it by the city of New York. One definition of pogrom is violence where the state doesn&#x27;t do enough to prevent it.&quot; Other political opponents to Dinkins used the term, including Ed Koch, who had been defeated by Dinkins in the 1989 Democratic mayoralty primary, and Andrew Stein, a candidate in the 1993 Democratic mayoral primary. The term had been used previously in 1991 by journalists such as A. M. Rosenthal in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Eric Breindel in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and politicians such as New York City Councilman Noach Dear and later by Judah Gribetz, president of the JCRC of New York. By September 1991, it had become routine within Jewish circles to describe the riot as a pogrom. Some Jews continued to use this term for the riot a decade later, as shown by articles in publications such as &quot;Jewish Week&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;The Forward&quot; and &quot;The Jewish Press&quot;; others went further and called it &quot;America&#x27;s Kristallnacht&quot;.

Use of the word was rejected by Dinkins and his supporters, primarily on the basis that a pogrom by definition is state sponsored. Dinkins said, &quot;To suggest that this is [a pogrom] is not to contribute to the resolution of the problem but to exacerbate tensions and problems that are there.&quot; Dinkins was personally offended by the use of &quot;pogrom&quot; since it insinuated that the riot was state-sanctioned and that he personally was an antisemite. &quot;I am incensed by it... [it is] patently untrue and unfair.&quot;

Michael Stanislawski, Professor of Jewish History at Columbia University, wrote in 1992 that it was &quot;historically inaccurate&quot; to couple &quot;pogrom&quot; with Crown Heights, because the word denoted organized violence against Jews &quot;having some sort of governmental involvement.&quot; Journalists also disagreed with the use of the term, including Joyce Purnick in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Earl Caldwell in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and an article in &quot;The City Sun&quot;. Rev. Al Sharpton said that Giuliani was engaged in &quot;race-baiting&quot; by using the word &quot;pogrom.&quot; Henry Siegman and Marc D. Stern of the American Jewish Congress also publicly rejected use of the term to refer to the riot.

In 2011, shortly before the twentieth anniversary of the riots, an editorial in &quot;The Jewish Week&quot; wrote: &quot;A divisive debate over the meaning of pogrom, lasting for more than two years, could have easily been ended if the mayor simply said to the victims of Crown Heights, yes, I understand why you experienced it as a pogrom.&quot;

===Ethnic relations===
Prior to the riots, Eastern Parkway divided the black community in northern Crown Heights and the Jewish community in southern Crown Heights. Efforts aimed at the improvement of the relations between black people and Jews in Crown Heights began almost immediately following the rioting. Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden summoned the leaders of each of the ethnic communities to Borough Hall within days after the riots ended, creating what became known as the Crown Heights Coalition. The Coalition, led by Edison O. Jackson, then President of Medgar Evers College, and Rabbi Shea Hecht, chairman of the Board of the National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education (NCFJE), operated for ten years as an inter-group forum in which to air neighborhood concerns and work out issues. Golden used the Coalition to initiate interracial projects designed to promote dialogue. One project involved sending a Jewish leader and a black leader together in a pair to public intermediate and high schools in the area to answer questions from the children about each other&#x27;s cultures.

A week after the riots, Hatzolah helped repair an ambulance of a black-owned volunteer service. The following year, the Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum held an exhibit on the contributions made by black people and Jews in New York. In 1993, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was active in promoting improved black-Jewish relations. In 1993, a series of neighborhood basketball games were scheduled between the two groups, including a scrimmage held as part of the halftime entertainment of a New York Knicks vs. Philadelphia 76ers professional basketball game. Also that year, Rabbi Israel Shemtov, whose anti-crime patrol had long been perceived by many black residents as biased against them, rushed to the aid of a black woman who had been shot on the street in Crown Heights, putting her in his car and taking her to the hospital. The Crown Heights Mediation Center was established in 1998 to help resolve local differences, also a direct outcome of the Coalition.

===Anniversary commemorations===
On August 19, 2001, a street fair was held in memory of Cato and Rosenbaum, and their relatives met and exchanged mementos in hopes of healing in Crown Heights. Again in 2016, family members Carmel Cato and Norman Rosenbaum planned to meet together to commemorate their loss.

Twenty years after the riot, a Manhattan synagogue invited Sharpton to participate in a panel discussion marking the anniversary. Norman Rosenbaum, brother of the murdered Yankel Rosenbaum, was outraged, saying inviting Sharpton to speak was &quot;an absolute disgrace&quot; and that his &quot;vile rhetoric incited the rioting.&quot; He added that Sharpton &quot;did absolutely nothing then to improve black-Jewish relations — and nothing since.&quot; Sharpton expressed regret for some aspects of his involvement. He insisted that his marches were peaceful, although his language and tone &quot;sometimes exacerbated tensions.&quot;

In a 2019 speech to a Reform Jewish gathering, Sharpton said that he could have &quot;done more to heal rather than harm&quot;. He recalled receiving a call from Coretta Scott King at the time, during which she told him &quot;sometimes you are tempted to speak to the applause of the crowd rather than the heights of the cause, and you will say cheap things to get cheap applause rather than do high things to raise the nation higher&quot;.

===Demographics===
In his 2006 book on the riot, Edward Shapiro wrote that the demographic trends of Crown Heights remained largely the same as in 1991. Jews did not flee from Crown Heights, and the Lubavitch population of Crown Heights increased after the riot, leading to an expansion of the area in which they reside.

==In popular culture==
Anna Deavere Smith interviewed more than 100 people directly and indirectly associated with the riot and created her play &quot;Fires in the Mirror&quot; (1992), a one-woman show with Smith playing the roles of numerous public and private figures, having drawn quotes from the transcripts of her interviews. 

The television film &quot;Crown Heights&quot; (2004), starring Howie Mandel, focused on the aftermath of the riot.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir William Francis Drummond Jervois (10 September 1821 – 17 August 1897) was a British military engineer and diplomat. After joining the British Army in 1839, he saw service, as a second captain, in South Africa. In 1858, as a major, he was appointed Secretary of a Royal Commission set up to examine the state and efficiency of British land-based fortifications against naval attack; and this led to further work in Canada and South Australia. From 1875 to 1888 he was, consecutively, Governor of the Straits Settlements, Governor of South Australia and Governor of New Zealand.

==Early life==
Born on 10 September 1821 in Cowes in the Isle of Wight, Jervois was the son of General William Jervois (pronounced &quot;Jarvis&quot;), and his wife Elizabeth Jervois (née Maitland). From a military family of Huguenot descent, he was educated at Dr. Burney&#x27;s Academy, Gosport, before entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

==Military service==

Upon graduating from Woolwich, Jervois was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in March 1839. From then until 1841, Jervois was trained at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham. In 1842, having been promoted to lieutenant the year before, Jervois was sent to South Africa where he served as a brigade major. As a second captain he saw service in the 7th Xhosa War, 1846–1847 during which he drew military sketches of British Kaffraria (now part of the Eastern Cape Province) in South Africa.

Returning to Britain in 1848, he commanded a company of Sappers and Miners at Woolwich and then in June 1849 was ordered to Alderney with instructions to manage the construction of substantial fortifications. Following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to inspect the progress of the fortifications in 1854, he was promoted to the rank of major. Having been refused permission to go to the Crimea he returned to London in January 1855, he became the Commanding Royal Engineer (Major) for the London District and Assistant Inspector-General of Fortifications in April the following year. Jervois became Secretary of a Royal Commission set up on 20 August 1859 to examine the state and efficiency of British land-based fortifications against naval attack. It was specifically tasked to consider Portsmouth, Spithead, the Isle of Wight, Plymouth, Portland, Pembroke Dock, Dover, Chatham and the Medway. The commission&#x27;s report was published on 7 February 1860. Amongst other things, it proposed several options for a ring of defences around London, none of which were adopted, although elements were used in the later London Defence Scheme. Jervois went on to oversee the design of the resulting fortifications that became known as the Palmerston Forts.

Promotion to lieutenant colonel came in 1861, and in 1864 and 1865, he was sent to Canada to review its fortifications and at the conclusion of his inspection he submitted what became a politically controversial report that stated that the Great Lakes and Upper Canada were not defensible. He then lectured about iron fortifications, and inspected and provided advice regarding the defences of various British colonies including Gibraltar and the Andaman Islands. He was promoted to colonel in 1867. In 1871 he was sent to India; and then worked on the defences of Cork harbour, which were completed in 1874.

Following the withdrawal of British garrison troops from Australia in 1870, Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley were commissioned by a group of colonies to advise on defence matters. They inspected each colony&#x27;s defences and produced the Jervois-Scratchley reports of 1877 and 1878. These emphasised the importance of shore-based fortifications to defend against naval attack and also led to the establishment of local infantry and artillery units. In the 1880s many of the reports&#x27; recommendations were implemented by the various colonial governments and they went on to form the basis of defence planning in Australia and New Zealand until Federation. Jervois was raised to the rank of major general in 1877; he received a final promotion to lieutenant general in 1882.

==Diplomatic career==
===Governor of the Straits Settlements===
In April 1875, Jervois was appointed the Governor of the Straits Settlements, a British dependency which included Penang, Malacca and Singapore. He took office in Singapore on 8 May 1875, and served until 3 April 1877. Decisions he made during his tenure cemented Britain&#x27;s foothold on the Malay peninsula; he was instrumental in the formation of a local militia and the quelling of a Malay uprising. Although distrustful of Malays, he was sympathetic to the Chinese and would later bolster public support for oriental immigration during his time as Governor of South Australia.

===Governor of South Australia===
During an 1877 inspection of Australian maritime defences, Jervois was appointed Governor of South Australia. He was given notice of his &quot;promotion&quot; while in Melbourne in June, although the true reason for his reassignment was that the Colonial Office disliked his interference on the Malay mainland. Jervois arrived in South Australia on HMS &quot;Sapphire&quot; on 2 October 1877.

Jervois arrived in the colony during a time of political crisis. Later in October, the Colton Ministry resigned over a disagreement with the Legislative Council about the new Parliamentary buildings. Jervois resisted the pressure to dissolve parliament, and James Boucaut became Premier. Jervois&#x27; term also coincided with unusually good rainfall and a massive agricultural expansion, including his own efforts to establish an irrigation scheme on the Murray River. He laid the foundation stones of the University of Adelaide, the Institute and the Art Gallery, and commissioned a new vice-regal summer residence at Marble Hill.

===Governor of New Zealand===
Jervois then served as Governor of New Zealand from 1883 to 1888. In this role, Jervois provided advice on harbour defence, guided the colonial government on Imperial matters, was active in the country&#x27;s social life, and worked to promote equality. He officiated at the opening of Auckland University College in 1883, declaring that it would be accessible to all New Zealanders, and recognised the service of nurses in the Zululand conflict, awarding a Royal Red Cross to a New Zealand woman for the first time. He also engaged with the Maori leadership. He also served as president of the New Zealand Institute and patronised many sporting institutions, including the New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association.

==Later life==
At the conclusion of his term as governor-general in New Zealand, Jervois returned to England in 1889. The following year, he was appointed to serve on the Stanhope Commission, which again reviewed the state of Britain&#x27;s fortifications. He returned to New Zealand briefly in 1892, before being appointed the colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers the following year.

His wife, Lucy, with whom he had had three daughters and two sons since their marriage in 1850, died in 1895. Jervois died on 17 August 1897, at the age of 75, as a result of injuries sustained in a carriage accident, and was buried at Virginia Water, Surrey.

==Honours==
Jervois received numerous honours for his military and diplomatic service. He was invested Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1863, Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1874, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1888. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1888. Several streets were also named after him, including: Jervois Quay in Wellington and Jervois Street in Christchurch, and Jervois Close and Jervois Road in Singapore. In Australia, a bridge in Adelaide, a mine and Jervois, a locality on the Murray River in South Australia were named for him. Jervois Glacier in New Zealand&#x27;s Fiordland National Park also bears his name.

<text>The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is a nonprofit organization whose members include more than 200 law schools throughout the United States, Canada and Australia. Its headquarters are in Newtown, Pennsylvania (about 15 miles north of Philadelphia).

The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is a nonprofit corporation that provides products and services to facilitate the admission process for law schools and their applicants worldwide. More than 200 law schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia are members of the Council. All law schools approved by the American Bar Association are LSAC members, as are Canadian law schools recognized by a provincial or territorial law society or government agency. Many nonmember law schools also use LSAC&#x27;s services.

Founded in 1947, the Council is best known for administering the Law School Admission Test (LSAT®), with over 150,000 tests administered annually at testing centers worldwide. In the face of pushback from members of the Law School Admission Council, some schools have begun rolling out the GRE as a testing alternative to the LSAT. LSAC processes academic credentials for an average of 85,000 law school applicants annually, provides essential software and information for admission offices and applicants, conducts educational conferences for law school professionals and prelaw advisors, sponsors and publishes research, funds diversity and other outreach grant programs, and publishes LSAT preparation books and websites and law school guides, among many other services.

<doc id="1113898" wikidata="Q7888207" url="?curid=1113898" title="United Labour Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The United Labour Party (ULP) of New Zealand was an early centre-left to left-wing political party. Founded in 1912, it represented the more moderate wing of the labour movement. In 1916 it joined with other political groups to establish the modern Labour Party.

== Origins ==
The United Labour Party has its origins in the first Labour Party, a distinct organisation from the modern one. The first Labour Party had been established in 1910 after the perceived failure of its predecessor, the Independent Political Labour League. The Labour Party represented the moderate wing of the labour movement, with the Socialist Party representing the more radical faction.

== Initial unification ==
By 1912 there was growing recognition that the division of the labour movement was costing votes, and a &quot;unity conference&quot; was called. The Socialists and the associated Federation of Labour (the &quot;Red Feds&quot;) refused to attend, however, saying that they would continue to advocate their more hard-line positions. As such, the Unity Conference consisted only of the Labour Party, various moderate trade unions, and independent labour candidates.

At the conclusion of the conference, it was agreed that the Labour Party, the moderate unions, and a number of independents would together form a new party. The new group was called the United Labour Party. The outcome of the conference was slightly disappointing for its organisers, as it had been hoped that the Socialists would join, but hopes for the new party were nevertheless high.

Later the same year, the Waihi miners&#x27; strike occurred. The labour movement was split, with hard-liners praising the strikers and moderates condemning the action as dangerous and misguided. The United Labour Party took the latter path, believing that cautious negotiation was more effective than militant action. The strike was eventually suppressed by the government of William Massey, with one miner being killed.

The strike created much disunity in the labour movement, and many believed that active measures were necessary to bring the movement closer together. As such, another &quot;Unity Conference&quot; was called in 1913. This time, the Socialist Party was willing to attend. After extensive negotiations, it was decided that the labour movement should speak with a single voice, and that the United Labour Party and the Socialist Party should merge. The new party would be called the Social Democratic Party. The union elements of the United Labour Party would be merged with the Socialist-affiliated Federation of Labour to produce the new United Federation of Labour.

== Fractionalization ==

Some members of the United Labour Party did not accept the decision to merge, however. Of particular concern to them was a clause in the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s charter that obliged it to support strikes in certain circumstances. These members decided to remain outside the Social Democrats, and continued to use the United Labour label. They became unofficially known as the United Labour Party Remnant. The Remnant officially repudiated the more Marxist tendencies that the Social Democrats had inherited from the Socialist Party, and promoted arbitration as a better alternative to strike action. The Remnant considered itself to be vindicated when, later in the year, the Social Democrats were thrown into disarray by a heavy-handed government response to dockworkers&#x27; and miners&#x27; strikes. In the 1914 elections, the United Labour Party Remnant won three seats in Parliament, with the victorious candidates being Alfred Hindmarsh, Bill Veitch, and Andrew Walker while the Social Democrats won two seats, and a labour-aligned independent John Payne won another seat.

== Creation of the present Labour Party ==
Despite the differences between the United Labour Party Remnant and the Social Democrat Party, the two worked together in Parliament after the 1914 election. Alfred Hindmarsh of the United Labour Party served as the leader of the six labour-aligned MPs. Gradually, this increased co-operation caused the ULP Remnant and the SDP to conclude that full unification was not impossible, and in 1916, the two finally came together (along with various independents) to form the Labour Party, which still survives today.

==List of presidents==
* Tom Paul 1912–13
* John Rigg 1913–14
* David McLaren 1914–15
* Alfred Hindmarsh 1915–16

<doc id="1113899" wikidata="Q48308" url="?curid=1113899" title=".nf">
<text>.nf is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Norfolk Island. While there is no rule requiring a local presence to register domains in this TLD, the pricing is significantly higher than most other domains, which has discouraged its use. Although registrations at the second level are the most expensive, they are still more common than third-level registrations, and most names in use are for sites relating to Norfolk Island.

.nf is a member of CoCCA, a group of country-code domains making use of common registry and/or dispute resolution services.

==Second-level domains==
These second-level domains are available for third-level registrations, with no restriction on who can register them. .com.nf and .net.nf parallel the .com and .net TLDs, while some of the others appear to be based on proposed new TLDs from the late 1990s which were never implemented (other than the eventual use of .info and com.nf).

* .com.nf
* .net.nf
* .arts.nf
* .store.nf
* .web.nf

Norfolk Island Data Services has also reserved:

* .firm.nf
* .info.nf
* .other.nf
* .per.nf
* .rec.nf

==.co.nf==
A .co.nf second-level domain exists which is commonly misinterpreted as the real commercial second-level domain for the island. The domain is run by a web-hosting provider called biz.nf.

As of 2 September 2019, .co.nf was unavailable and a notice was posted on the control panel of the website hosting stating that the registry has suspended the domain, and replaced it with the .c1.biz subdomain.

<text>James Leslie Darcy (28 October 189524 May 1917) was an Australian boxer. He was a middleweight, but held the Australian Heavyweight Championship title at the same time.

Les Darcy was the 2003 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Old Timers category and was the first to be elevated to Legend status in 2009.

==History==

Les Darcy was born near Maitland, New South Wales. He started boxing as an amateur at age fifteen and quickly turned professional. He won his first sixteen fights before challenging the veteran Bob Whitelaw for the Australian welterweight title. Darcy lost the twenty-round decision but, in a rematch, knocked Whitelaw out in five rounds.

Darcy graduated from regional bouts to fighting in Sydney Stadium, in Rushcutters Bay, and promoters began to import talent to challenge him. He lost his first two fights in Sydney, one by decision and one by foul, to America&#x27;s Fritz Holland.
The next year Darcy faced another American, Jeff Smith, in what was considered a contest for the Australian world middleweight title. When Darcy complained of a low blow at the end of the fifth round, the referee believed that Darcy did not want to continue and awarded the decision to Smith. In a rematch, Darcy was awarded the victory when Smith punched him in the groin.

As Australian world middleweight champ, Darcy defeated such top-flight visiting Americans as Eddie McGoorty, Billy Murray, Jimmy Clabby, George Chip, George &quot;KO&quot; Brown, and Buck Crouse, as well as knocking out Smith and Holland in rematches. Darcy&#x27;s opponents are said to have admired his courage, stamina, and punching power. In 1916, Darcy knocked Harold Hardwick out to capture the Australian heavyweight title.
Darcy became embroiled in the politics of conscription during World War I, and left Australia for the United States to avoid the aggravation. He died on 24 May 1917 from septicaemia and medical complications, which was speculated to be from dental work he received to replace teeth that had been knocked out during a bout.

After his death, Darcy&#x27;s embalmed body was returned to Australia, where an estimated half-million people paid their respects. His brother Frank, also a boxer who showed many of the attributes of his brother, including pluck, died on 9 May 1919 from influenza, and was buried in the Catholic Cemetery, East Maitland.

==Legacy==
*Darcy was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in October 1998, and the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003.
*Darcy was the subject of an episode of the 1950 radio series &quot;Famous Sportsmen of the Past&quot;
*Darcy was the subject of a 1950 radio feature
*He was the subject of a 1952 episode of the radio show &quot;They Were Champions&quot;
*His life was dramatised in the 1955 Australian radio serial &quot;The Life Story of Les Darcy&quot; 
*His life was dramatised as an episode of the 1988 Australian television series &quot;Mike Willesee&#x27;s Australians&quot; where Darcy was played by Peter Phelps
*In 2001, Raffaele Marcellino&#x27;s opera &quot;The Flight of Les Darcy&quot;, with libretto by Robert Jarman, premiered at the &quot;10 Days on the Island&quot; festival in Hobart. The character of Darcy has no singing role but is portrayed by a dancer, and draws on the story that he played the violin to prepare himself for fights.

<text>Vicente Lenílson de Lima (born June 4, 1977) is a Brazilian sprinter specializing in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and the 4×100 metres relay.

De Lima represented Brazil at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The 37.90 seconds were not enough to beat the 37.61 seconds of the United States, but De Lima, Edson Ribeiro, André da Silva and Claudinei da Silva managed to finish before the Cuban team who timed 38.04 seconds. At the 2003 World Championships he and his teammates won the silver medal at the 4x100 metres relay. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 3rd in his heat, just 0.06 after Usain Bolt and 0.02 after Daniel Bailey in a time of 10.26 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he ran slower with 10.31, resulting in a sixth place and elimination for the semi-finals. Together with José Carlos Moreira, Sandro Viana and Bruno de Barros he also competed at the 4x100 metres relay. In their qualification heat they placed fourth behind Trinidad and Tobago, Japan and the Netherlands. Their time of 39.01 was the seventh out of sixteen participating nations in the first round and they qualified for the final. There they sprinted to a time of 38.24 seconds, the fourth time after the Jamaican, Trinidad and Japanese teams.

De Silva would retroactively be awarded the bronze medal for the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics following the demotion of the Jamaican team in 2017 for Nesta Carter&#x27;s failed anti-doping test.

<text>The Pebco Three were three black South African anti-apartheid activists – Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela, and Qaqawuli Godolozi – who were abducted and subsequently murdered in 1985 by members of the South African security police.

==History of PEBCO==
After an increase in the cost of living for the Black population in Port Elizabeth – following a 100% rent fee price hike in the late 1970s – the residents of Port Elizabeth decided to organise themselves and form an organisation that would challenge socio-economic injustices that were meted out on Black people including the apartheid regime. On the 10 October 1979, after having officially established the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO), a public meeting was held where it was decided that a protest against the increase in rent, transport, fuel and lighting, township services charges and food costs be held. 

PEBCO&#x27;s immediate aims and demands were: to fight for equal rights for all people of Port Elizabeth; to fight all discriminatory legislation enacted by the government and local authorities; to seek participation in decision making on all matters affecting the people of South Africa; to fight for the granting of the right to Blacks to buy land under freehold title at any place of their choice; and to resist any attempt, direct or indirect, to deprive Blacks of their South African citizenship. Their fundamental aim included the creation of one municipality for the whole of Port Elizabeth, therefore rejecting the system of community councils and separate municipalities for Blacks and Whites.

==The disappearance==
The 1980s proved to be a volatile period for activism in Port Elizabeth and as such, leaders of PEBCO were detained for short stints from time to time. In 1980, five of its leaders were detained, including Thozamile Botha, the founding member, who in the previous year – 1979 – was dismissed at the Ford Company in New Brighton for his political involvement and organising workers on site. He soon left the country in May 1980 to join the ANC in exile, leaving his comrade Qaqawuli Godolozi as PEBCO&#x27;s new president. Five years later, on 8 May 1985, three members – Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela, and Qaqawuli Godolozi – disappeared from the airport in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. This was due to the fact that PEBCO had now affiliated itself with the United Democratic Front (UDF), which was believed by some at the time to be an internal wing of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC). As a result of the three&#x27;s disappearance, the Consumer Boycott Committee organised a huge consumer boycott which began in July 1985. Although it was strongly suspected that the Security Police had something to do with the three activists&#x27; disappearance, nothing was known of their fate until November 1997.

==The confession==
On 11 November, former Security Police Officer Colonel Gideon Nieuwoudt, while applying for amnesty during a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing, confessed to participating in the beating, robbery, and murder of the PEBCO Three. According to his testimony, Nieuwoudt lured the three men by having a paid police informant pose as a British embassy official interested in providing a cash donation to PEBCO call Sipho Hashe at his home. The informant convinced Sipho and his two friends to come to the airport to pick up the donation. (Nieuwoudt later refused to name the informant for fear of his safety.) The three men were apprehended by members of the Security Police and taken to an abandoned police station on a farm at Post Chalmers, near Cradock. They were then interrogated, stripped of their possessions, beaten, sedated, and finally strangled. The bodies were burned and the remains were thrown into the nearby Fish River. Eugene de Kock a former head of section C1 at the Vlakplaas farm north of Pretoria where many of these atrocities occurred – in his submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) about the death of the PEBCO Three – admits to this and writes that in late 1985 there began an altercation between two members of his Vlakplaas team, sergeant Joe Mamasela and warrant officer Gert Beeslaar who had been involved in an operation in Port Elizabeth in which the PEBCO Three were murdered.

==The court case==
Also incriminated in the case were former policemen Johan Martin Van Zyl and Johannes Koole. Van Zyl voluntarily surrendered to police in Port Elizabeth on 11 February 2004. He had been out of the country on murder and three counts of assault to do grievous bodily harm. The trial was set for 12 October but has since been postponed by the defence, pending aTruth and Reconciliation Commission review of the 1989 Motherwell Bombing in which Nieuwoudt was also involved. The TRC refused to grant amnesty to the three perpetrators Van Zyl, Nieuwoudt and Lotz, citing that the three had failed to make full disclosure in the case of the PEBCO Three.

<text>The Diocese of Birmingham is a diocese founded in 1905 in the Church of England&#x27;s Province of Canterbury, covering the north-west of the traditional county of Warwickshire, the south-east of the traditional county of Staffordshire and the north-east of the traditional county of Worcestershire (now the central section of the West Midlands and small parts of south Staffordshire, north Warwickshire and north Worcestershire) in England.

== Cathedral ==
The see is in the centre of the City of Birmingham, where the seat of the diocese is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Philip.

The 18th-century parish church of Saint Philip in Birmingham was elevated to cathedral status in 1905 when the see was founded, on 13 January 1905. Previously the area had been part of the Diocese of Worcester.

== Bishops ==
Besides the diocesan Bishop of Birmingham (Michael Volland) and the Bishop suffragan of Aston (vacant; which see was created in 1954), there are two retired bishops resident in (or near) the diocese who are licensed to serve as honorary assistant bishops:
*2002–present: Maurice Sinclair is a retired Presiding Bishop of the Southern Cone living in Selly Park.
*2005–present: Iraj Mottahedeh is a retired diocesan Bishop of Iran who lives in Church Aston, Shropshire, in the neighbouring Lichfield diocese.

From 2023, alternative episcopal oversight (for parishes in the diocese who reject the ministry of women priests) was provided by the provincial episcopal visitor, the Bishop suffragan of Oswestry (since 2023 Paul Thomas), who is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese in order to facilitate his work there.

== Archdeaconries and deaneries ==
The former deaneries of Yardley and Bordesley were merged in 2000. Central Birmingham was known as Birmingham City until 1996 and then Birmingham City Centre until 2004.

== Safeguarding controversy ==
In December 2018 the diocese was criticised for its use of a Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA) in relation to an abuse case. The survivor described the ten-year process since her first complaint as &quot;haphazard&quot; and claimed she was warned by an unnamed bishop not to talk to the media as it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;very godly&quot;. The diocese carried out an independent review which delivered damning findings about the handling of her case by the (then) Bishop of Birmingham, David Urquhart, and then forced the survivor to sign the NDA before she was permitted to see the review into her own case. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, had previously questioned the legitimacy of these agreements in March 2018 at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse The Bishop of Buckingham, Alan Wilson, commenting on the scandal said it was the fourth &quot;corrupt and destructive&quot; non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that had come to his attention since September.

He said he was unable to share details of the other cases but that some were &quot;complete shockers&quot;. The Diocese of Birmingham said the NDA had been used to ensure that those who read the report did not share information provided by other contributors who wanted to remain anonymous. A Church of England spokesperson stated that guidance would be sent to all dioceses to discourage use of these agreements. The bishop and the diocese apologised to the survivor and her husband.

<doc id="1113940" wikidata="Q330143" url="?curid=1113940" title="Sydney FC">
<text>Sydney Football Club, commonly known as Sydney FC, is a professional association football club based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Competing in the top-tier men&#x27;s league, A-League Men. Established in 2004, they were among the eight founding teams for the inaugural 2005–06 A-League season.

Domestically, Sydney FC have won a record five A-League Men Championships, four A-League Men Premierships and two Australia Cups. Additionally, the club has won the OFC Champions League once in international competition.

Before the 2018–19 season, the club’s home ground was the Allianz Stadium in Moore Park. When the NSW Government announced that the stadium would be redeveloped before the 2019 New South Wales state election, the team temporarily played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Jubilee Oval and Leichhardt Oval. In October 2022, the club returned to the newly rebuilt Allianz Stadium. In 2023, Sydney FC completed their new training and administration facility, Sky Park, in North Ryde.

During the club&#x27;s first seven years, it was the only A-League team in Sydney, attracting a broad fanbase across the Sydney Metropolitan Area. Sydney FC are Australia&#x27;s most supported A-League club, with 693,000 fans as of 2023. Its leading supporter group, &quot;The Cove,&quot; derives its name from Sydney Cove, a bay on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour. They compete in the local Sydney Derby against cross-town rivals Western Sydney Wanderers. As the two most decorated clubs in the A-League Men and fierce inter-state rivals, the club also shares a long-standing rivalry with Melbourne Victory, known as The Big Blue.

Alex Brosque is the club&#x27;s all-time top goal scorer, with 83 goals in all competitions. Rhyan Grant has the most appearances for the club, having played 366 games.

==History==
===2004–2009: early years===
The first steps towards the foundation of Sydney FC were taken in April 2004 when Soccer New South Wales (now Football NSW) announced its intention to bid for a licence in the new A-League competition. The bid was lodged with the Australian Soccer Association (now Football Australia) on 19 July, challenged only by a consortium headed by Nick Politis, known as the &quot;Sydney Blues&quot;, for Sydney&#x27;s place in the &#x27;one team per city&#x27; competition. A public row broke out between the two bidders after reports that the ASA were set to vote in favour of Sydney FC, causing Politis to withdraw his support for a team, and leaving Sydney FC as the only candidate remaining.

Sydney FC was officially launched as a member of the new 8-team A-League on 1 November 2004, with a 25% stake in the club held by Soccer NSW, the remainder privately owned. Walter Bugno was announced as the inaugural chairman of the club. On 11 December 2004, Soccer NSW announced that it would pull out of its involvement with Sydney FC amid concerns over part owner Frank Lowy&#x27;s autocratic style in establishing the club and lack of consultation with Soccer NSW on key Sydney FC issues. These included the choice of the Sydney Football Stadium over Parramatta Stadium as the team&#x27;s home ground, and the erosion of Soccer NSW&#x27;s initial 100 per cent involvement to just 25 per cent.

By February 2005, Sydney FC had filled 16 of its allowed 20 squad positions—attracting Socceroos Alvin Ceccoli, Clint Bolton, Steve Corica and David Zdrilic as well as youth internationals Justin Pasfield, Mark Milligan, Wade Oostendorp, Iain Fyfe and Jacob Timpano. German Pierre Littbarski was signed as head coach, assisted by former Norwich City player Ian Crook. Sydney FC played its first ever match against Manly United on 25 March 2005, winning 6–1. Shortly after, Sydney FC set off on a tour to the United Arab Emirates to play against local teams FC Hatta, Al Ain and Al Jazira, winning all three. While in Dubai, Sydney FC announced that it had agreed to terms with former Manchester United player Dwight Yorke as the club&#x27;s &quot;marquee player&quot;– one paid outside of the $1.5million salary cap— for two seasons.

Sydney FC&#x27;s first competitive match was against Queensland Roar at Central Coast Stadium in Gosford as part of the 2005 Australian Club World Championship Qualifying Tournament. After winning 3–0, Sydney went on to defeat Perth Glory and Central Coast Mariners to qualify for the 2005 Oceania Club Championship, held in Tahiti. Despite an early scare against New Zealand club Auckland City, Sydney FC won all of its matches and qualified for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship in Japan. The start of the 2005 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup marked Sydney FC&#x27;s first match at Allianz Stadium, as well as Dwight Yorke&#x27;s first appearance for the club. Yorke scored the first goal of Sydney FC&#x27;s 3–1 win which stretched its unbeaten run to 9 competitive matches (15 including friendlies). Upon reaching the semi-finals, Sydney&#x27;s unbeaten run finally ended at 11 with Perth Glory midfielder Nick Ward scoring in injury time to inflict the new club&#x27;s first ever loss.

Sydney FC&#x27;s first season was ultimately a success. Finishing second behind Adelaide United they went on to defeat Central Coast Mariners 1–0 in the 2006 A-League Grand Final with Steve Corica scoring in the second half of the game. However, the club&#x27;s success wouldn&#x27;t last long, with German manager Pierre Littbarski leaving the club after refusing to accept a lower salary and inaugural marquee player Dwight Yorke being signed by Premier League club Sunderland. Former English international Terry Butcher was signed as Sydney FC&#x27;s new coach for 2006–07. However it was regarded as an overall failure, with Sydney playing poorly despite the signing of Alex Brosque and Benito Carbone as a Guest player. Sydney also had 3 points deducted during the season, after it was found that they had breached the Salary cap, involving player David Zdrillic. Despite the off field problems, Sydney managed to scrape into the finals series, however they lost in the semi-final to Newcastle Jets. Although Butcher led the club into the finals, Sydney fans were unhappy with his tactics. In the end Butcher and Sydney FC went their separate ways at the end of the season. Sydney FC would go on to sign Branko Čulina for its 2007 AFC Champions League campaign, where they finished second in the group, one point behind ultimate champions and J-League heavyweights Urawa Red Diamonds. Despite the ACL success, Sydney FC&#x27;s start to the 2007–08 season was poor, and the club sacked him, replacing him with former Adelaide United manager John Kosmina. Sydney FC played well for the rest of the season but were knocked out in the finals by Brisbane Roar. Kosmina couldn&#x27;t repeat the success of the previous season, replacing Brazilian international Juninho with Socceroos hero John Aloisi on a million dollar contract. The club also unveiled Newcastle Jets championship winners Mark Bridge and Stuart Musialik as well as Socceroo Simon Colosimo for the 2008–09 season. The season did not live up to expectations even with these key signings. Aloisi didn&#x27;t perform very well during the season and came under heavy fire. So too did manager Kosmina, whose tactics were seen as controversial. His relationship with the media often became angry and frustrated which didn&#x27;t help causes. Many players fell out of favour with the coach, including Steve Corica and Clint Bolton. For the first time in the club&#x27;s history, they failed to make the Finals. As a result Kosmina was fired when Russian billionaire David Traktovenko became owner in March 2009.

===2009–2012: Lavicka tenure===
The fresh change at the club was about to bear fruit, when Sydney announced they had signed Czech Republic manager Vítězslav Lavička. Lavicka completely changed the structure of the club, and for its first time turning it into a serious, European style soccer club. He kept faith in Steve Corica and John Aloisi and several others who had threatened to walk out, and as a result, Sydney FC won its first premiership. Sydney made it to the Grand Final of the fifth season of the A-League after defeating Wellington Phoenix in the preliminary final. The Grand Final was played against Melbourne Victory at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne. Sydney took the lead after 61 minutes through a Mark Bridge header, just seconds after Melbourne had a goal disallowed for offside. Melbourne equalised through Adrian Leijer in the 81st minute, and the game went to a penalty shootout with no goals scored in extra time. Melbourne skipper Kevin Muscat missed his penalty, with his shot hitting the post. Sydney FC won the Grand Final 4–2 on penalties which handed the club its second Hyundai A-League Championship.

Sydney FC&#x27;s title defence did not go smoothly. The club lost key players from its championship-winning side including Steve Corica (retired), Karol Kisel (return to Europe), Simon Colosimo, John Aloisi, and Clint Bolton (all Melbourne Heart). The club however picked up the services of former Socceroo Nick Carle from his stint in England with Crystal Palace. This wasn&#x27;t enough to steer the team in the right direction. The club was winless for the first ten rounds of the competition. Sydney FC managed to pick up a few points over the next few rounds but another five-game losing streak ensured they would not qualify for the finals competition, finishing ninth. The third season under Lavicka began with the major signing of Blackburn Rovers player Brett Emerton on a three-year deal. The signing was significant in that Emerton became the first player to directly exchange the FA Premier League for the A-League by terminating his Rovers contract one year early. The season however, only provided minimal success as the club scraped through to the finals series with a 3–2 win over Newcastle Jets in the final round of the regular season. Before the end of the season the club announced that head coach Lavicka&#x27;s contract would not be renewed for the following season.

===2012–2014: Farina reign===

The 2012–13 season was one of high drama. There was a new head coach Ian Crook and a high turnover of players in the off season. The expectations changed from a year of rebuilding to title contenders when the club acquired the services of international superstar Alessandro Del Piero. He signed on for $2 million per year and became the highest-paid player ever in the A-League.

After only six weeks into the regular season Sydney were forced to find a new coach with the shock resignation of Crook. He cited the role was &quot;a constant burden&quot; and was adversely affecting his health. Frank Farina was confirmed as Crook&#x27;s successor for the season two games into Steve Corica&#x27;s interim spell. During the January transfer window, Farina bolstered his defensive stocks with Socceroos captain Lucas Neill and Brazilian Tiago Calvano joining the team. The pair made nil significant impact and with a 3–1 loss away from home to Brisbane Roar, Sydney were unable to pick up a vital point that would have seen them play in the finals, finishing seventh.

For the 2013–14 pre season, the club became the first club in A-League history to tour in Europe, as Sydney toured in Venice, Italy, where the club played against Del Piero&#x27;s first professional club, Padova, Udinese Calcio, Vicenza Calcio, A.S. Cittadella, Venezia and Reggiana. Sydney won half of these six games however upon returning home lost five consecutive friendly games in the lead up to the season proper. Two-thirds of the way into the season and with Sydney FC only accumulating 4 points from 8 games, fans began to express concerns over the vision for the club. Banners at the club&#x27;s home game against Adelaide included sentiments like &quot;We want Farina gone.&quot; There was also a mass exodus from the club&#x27;s active supporter group, The Cove. The club then held a fan forum to receive questions and communicate the direction of the club. During the last nine rounds, Sydney FC only lost two games making the finals. The club lost to Melbourne Victory in the first week of the finals. This marked the end of the Frank Farina reign.

===2014–2018: Arnold era===

On 8 May 2014, Sydney FC announced its new head coach for the 2014–15 A-League season. With retirements to Brett Emerton in January and Terry McFlynn, and the contract expirations of marquee player Alessandro Del Piero, foreign player Ranko Despotović and former Socceroo Richard Garcia, there was a lot of experience to be filled by the club. Arnold announced his first signing on 12 May 2014, acquiring the services of his former Mariner winger Bernie Ibini-Isei. Sydney FC then announced signings of prolific A-League goalscorer Shane Smeltz and Socceroo Alex Brosque. After months of searching Arnold found his new marquee man in Austria national football team captain Marc Janko. On 8 October 2014, Brosque was announced as captain for the 2014–15 A-League season, alongside vice-captains Sasa Ognenovski and Nikola Petković. Sydney FC&#x27;s season began with the highly anticipated match-up against the newly re-branded Melbourne City and guest superstar David Villa. Whilst not starting the game, Villa came on early in the second half to claim the equalising goal, the result ending 1–1. Sydney FC continued on an eight-game undefeated streak that ended when Perth Glory came from behind to score two goals in the final seven minutes to claim victory at Allianz Stadium. The following week saw another thrilling Big Blue in Melbourne ending 3–3. Sydney FC struggled for form as they moved closer to the January break for the 2015 Asian Cup, not scoring in four consecutive matches. During this break, Sydney FC were able to bolster their stocks, signing Senegalese internationals Mickaël Tavares and Jacques Faty as injury replacement players. Upon resumption, Sydney FC posted 19 (out of a possible 21) points in the next seven rounds. Whilst slipping up twice at home to Melbourne City and Adelaide United (with scores of 0–1 in both games) during the final six rounds, Sydney FC managed to win all four other games away from home to finish second on the ladder with 50 points for the season. By the end of the regular season, Sydney FC had broken many records including a record club home season attendance (41,213 vs. Western Sydney Wanderers FC) and a league record number of away games undefeated in a season, as well as becoming the first club to score three or more goals in five consecutive games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney FC 2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Marquee Marc Janko also set his own A-League record for most consecutive goalscoring appearances with seven. After having the first week of the finals off, Sydney FC met Adelaide in the semi-finals at home. A brace from Alex Brosque set Sydney up for a 4–1 win. Ultimately, Sydney FC were outplayed in the 2015 A-League Grand Final, defeated by Melbourne Victory 3–0 at Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.

The following season was significantly less successful, finishing seventh in the league despite the star power of marquee Filip Hološko, and Serbian playmaker Miloš Ninković. However, Arnold coached the Sky Blues through a tough Asian Champions League group, finishing first and defeating defending champions Guangzhou Evergrande 2–1 at Allianz. Sydney progressed to the knockout stages for the first time, losing on away goals to Chinese side Shandong Luneng with Hao Junmin scoring a 90th-minute equaliser to finish the Sky Blues continental hopes.

Arnold reformed Sydney for the 2016–17 season, beginning with the signings of Socceroos centreback Alex Wilkinson, and leftback Michael Zullo both from Melbourne City. Joshua Brillante joined the Sky Blues on a three-year deal, keeping him at the Harbour City until 2019. The goalkeeping ranks were soon bolstered by the signing of Danny Vukovic, the A-League&#x27;s most capped player who also held a record A-League clean sheet tally. Bernie Ibini-Isei also rejoined the club on loan from Club Brugge, following a horrific leg injury. The biggest signing however was that of Brazilian striker Bobô on a one-year marquee deal, rejoining his former Beşiktaş teammate Filip Holosko. The season started with a 4–0 win over rivals Western Sydney in the Sydney Derby with new striker Bobô scoring on debut. They went on a six-game winning streak from this, conceding one goal. The club also reached the 2016 FFA Cup Final for the first time, losing to Melbourne City 1–0, in a highly controversial match.

This did not affect the momentum however, with Arnold&#x27;s men going 19 games unbeaten before losing to arch rivals Western Sydney Wanderers in the Sydney Derby. Despite this setback, Sydney FC marched on yet again, winning the Premier&#x27;s Plate with four games to spare and breaking numerous A-League records, including: most competition points, most wins in a season, fewest goals conceded, most clean sheets and best goal difference. Marquee striker Bobô ended the regular season as top scorer with 15 goals, narrowly missing Marc Janko&#x27;s record of 16. The club qualified for the 2018 AFC Champions League after finishing first, which was their fourth Asian Champions League campaign.

They finished the season as double winners – winning the 2017 A-League Grand Final 4–2 (1–1 AET) on penalties against Melbourne Victory at their former home ground, Allianz Stadium. The winning penalty was scored by Johnny Warren Medallist Miloš Ninković who re-signed for a following year the next day, before also being named player of the year at the club&#x27;s awards night.

The Sky Blues went on a successful FFA Cup run in 2017, starting with an 8–0 thumping of Northern Territory amateur side Darwin Rovers, with Bobô scoring a club record equalling 4 goals in the match. The following round they played NPL2 side Canterbury Bankstown, winning 3–0 in a fairly scrappy match, with goals from Carney, Bobô, and a debut goal from new signing Adrian Mierzejewski in injury time to put them through to the quarter finals. Sydney drew Melbourne City, marking the third battle between the two in the cup. An early goal from Jordy Buijs put Sydney up 1–0, before a second half goal from captain Alex Brosque sealed the win at Leichhardt Oval. In the semi-finals, they faced yet another Melbourne side, with a trip to Lakeside Stadium to play South Melbourne booked. The Sky Blues ran out 5–1 winners, with a brace from Bobô sealing their date with destiny in the 2017 FFA Cup Final to play Adelaide United. The final was played at Sydney Football Stadium, only the second time it had hosted an FFA Cup match. The Harbour City Originals opened the scoring on 20 minutes, as Milos Ninkovic latched onto a through ball, before sliding past a defender and poking a shot past goalkeeper Paul Izzo. The slender one-goal lead only had them in front until an equaliser by Nikola Mileusnic got Adelaide back into the game. The game was forced into extra time, before Bobô scored a header on 111 minutes to win the FFA Cup for Sydney FC.

The 2017—18 season proved to be successful after the FFA Cup win, with the Sky Blues becoming the first ever club to win back-to-back premierships in the A-League era, and the first in Australian national league history since Melbourne Knights.

With Graham Arnold being chosen to take over the Australian national team coaching role after the 2018 World Cup, his time at the club ended when his team were defeated 3–2 by Melbourne Victory, after extra time in a semi-final of the A-League finals series of 2017/18.

===2018–2023: Corica era===
Steve Corica became the ninth permanent head coach of Sydney FC when his tenure was officially announced on 16 May 2018. The announcement followed his ongoing thirteen year involvement with the club, signing on as a player in the inaugural 2005/06 season. After his retirement in 2010, Corica served his time as staff member for the club in various roles of assistant coach, youth team coach and the caretaker first team coach for two games in 2012. The off-season would prove be a crucial first test for Corica in terms of recruitment for some key positions. It had already been announced that key players from prior seasons including Dutch defender Jordy Buijs, former Socceroos Luke Wilkshire, David Carney and Matt Simon had all left the club as well as youth product Anthony Kalik returning to Europe as his loan deal expired. After the re-signing of current captain and club legend Alex Brosque within the first week of Corica&#x27;s tenure as manager things appeared to be going well for Corica. On 7 July 2018, after weeks of speculation, the club officially confirmed the exit of Johnny Warren Medalist Adrian Mierzejewski and the newly re-signed Golden Boot winner, Bobô, leaving big holes to fill in attack. In the following weeks after Bobô and Mierzejewski closed the door on their times at Sydney, the club announced the signings of former English Premier League star Adam Le Fondre and Dutch midfielder Siem de Jong on loan from Ajax. Fellow Dutchman Jop van der Linden was also revealed to be joining Sydney FC on a one-year deal.

This was the first season Sydney temporarily moved to Jubilee Oval while their home ground, Allianz Stadium, was under renovation. The team played their home matches at Jubilee, the Sydney Cricket Ground and also at Leichhardt Oval during the 2018–19 season.

The 2018–19 season was a successful campaign for Sydney FC, as they finished second in the regular season with 52 points, eight points behind premiers Perth Glory. In the 2018 FFA Cup, Sydney FC reached the final for the third consecutive year. They defeated Rockdale City Suns, Cairns FC, Avondale FC, and local rivals Western Sydney Wanderers 3–0 in the semi-finals, before facing Adelaide United in the final for the second consecutive season. Sydney FC lost at Hindmarsh Stadium 2–1 in the final after a brace from Mark Viduka Medalist Craig Goodwin, with Le Fondre scoring Sydney&#x27;s only goal of the night.

In the finals series, Sydney FC thumped Melbourne Victory 6–1 in the semi-finals, thanks to goals from Aaron Calver, Alex Brosque, an own goal from Leigh Broxham, Adam Le Fondre and Miloš Ninković equalling the record for the largest margin of victory in The Big Blue. Sydney then travelled to Perth for the 2019 Grand Final, defeating Perth Glory in the grand final after a dramatic penalty shootout, which ended 4–1 thanks to mid-season signing Reza Ghoochannejhad scoring the decisive penalty and Andrew Redmayne saving two penalties.

Overall, the 2018–19 season was largely a success for Steve Corica&#x27;s first season in charge and the team&#x27;s first season away from Allianz Stadium. They finished in the top two in all domestic competitions. However, their performance in the 2019 AFC Champions League was disappointing, as they failed to progress from the group stage. Finishing at the bottom of their group, with just three points from six matches.

On 7 April 2021, Sydney FC became the first A-League club to record 200 wins with a 1–0 win over Perth Glory.

Sydney FC moved into their newly rebuilt Sydney Football Stadium in Moore Park ahead of the 2022–23 season, with their return match to the venue coming in a round 1 Big Blue against arch rivals Melbourne Victory, losing 2–3 in a game impacted by heavy rain. Sydney made the semi-finals that season, having finished the season in fifth but having defeated Western Sydney Wanderers in an away derby Elimination Final. Sydney FC managed a 1–1 draw at home in the first leg of the semi final against Melbourne City, but were comprehensively beaten 4–0 in the second leg at AAMI Park in Melbourne.

The 2023–24 season started with success for Sydney FC, winning the 2023 Australia Cup with a 3–1 victory over Brisbane Roar in the final at home. However, a poor start to the A-League season which saw Sydney FC lose their first three matches without registering a goal, and languishing on the bottom of the table, saw Corica resign as Sydney FC coach after 5 full seasons in charge, 3 weeks after lifting the Australia Cup.

===2023–Present: Talay era===
The day after the mutual resignation of Steve Corica, Sydney FC appointed another former player as their new head coach, Ufuk Talay. On 20 June 2024, AFC confirmed that Sydney FC will participate in the inaugural 2024–25 AFC Champions League Two marking their first appearance in the competition.

==Colours and badge==

The primary club colour of Sydney FC is sky blue, which represents the state colour of New South Wales. The secondary club colour is navy blue, with additional contrasting colours of orange and white, however the colour orange does not feature in the club&#x27;s 2017 redesign of the crest.

The current Sydney FC badge was released on 17 May 2017 and is a reworking of a design by Liam Johnson on behalf of and submitted by the club&#x27;s supporter group, The Cove. The crest features the Sydney Opera House in white pictured in front of a sky-blue backdrop on top of a navy blue base featuring the Commonwealth Star. The Opera House represents an iconic landmark of Sydney, the sky-blue represents the club&#x27;s primary colour and the state colour of New South Wales, and the Commonwealth Star, also found on the Australian flag, is a symbol representing the Federation of Australia.

The initial Sydney FC badge was created and used since the club&#x27;s founding in 2004. It featured a soccer ball set centrally in a stylised crest shape. Above the ball was the shape of three shells of the Sydney Opera House, and below that was the Commonwealth Star.

There is a silver star atop the badge with the numeral five written inside it, representing the number of championships the club has won.

==Stadiums==
Sydney FC plays its home matches at the newly constructed Sydney Football Stadium. The team moved into the stadium for the 2022–23 A-League Mens season. Their first match at the stadium was against the club&#x27;s fierce rivals, Melbourne Victory on 8 October 2022 in front of 21,840 supporters. Sydney lost the match 2–3.

The home ground was built as a replacement for the original Sydney Football Stadium. This stadium was built in 1988 to be the premium &quot;rectangular field&quot; for rugby league matches. It was also used for soccer and rugby union for major matches and domestic competition. The stadium was then demolished in 2019 to be rebuilt into a boutique, world class venue. It had been the venue for Australian international matches (notably World Cup Qualifier against Argentina in 1993). The stadium&#x27;s capacity was stated at 41,159 prior to renovations in 2007, although the attendance of the 2006 A-League grand final exceeded this number by over 500. The stated capacity prior to demolition was 45,500. Sydney FC&#x27;s final game at the stadium was a 2–3 extra time loss to Melbourne Victory in the 2017–18 A-League Semifinal.

Prior to the current season, for four years whilst the new stadium was being built between the 2018–19 and 2021–22 seasons, Sydney played its home games out of two stadiums, Leichhardt Oval and Jubilee Oval. The Sydney Cricket Ground located in Moore Park was used in its first season of this redevelopment period. With a capacity of 46,000, it was used for the club&#x27;s major fixtures during their time away from their traditional home, although this was eventually abandoned until the Sydney Derby on 23 May 2021.

Sydney FC have played matches at other Sydney venues. Parramatta Stadium in western Sydney was the venue for an AFC Champions League match against Indonesian football side Persik Kediri in April 2007 when the SFS was unavailable due to an NRL match being played there. A friendly match against Los Angeles Galaxy was played at ANZ Stadium in November 2007 due to its greater capacity, and drew a crowd of 80,295. The club has also played regular season games there against Perth Glory in 2012, and Newcastle Jets and Melbourne City in 2016. Sydney played one home game at WIN Stadium in Wollongong on 3 January 2015 against Newcastle Jets. They also played at Campbelltown Stadium against Perth Glory in the 2011–12 A-League season. In 2020, Sydney used CommBank Stadium as its home venue for the 2019–20 A-League final series. In the semifinal, Sydney defeated Perth Glory 2–0 and in the Grand Final they defeated Melbourne City 1–0 after extra time, via a Rhyan Grant goal.

On 17 May 2017, the club and SCG Trust agreed to a ten-year extension of the lease.

===Club facilities===

Sydney FC&#x27;s primary training ground is at Macquarie University in North Ryde, called Sky Park. It also hosts the clubs Women team, as well as all academy players, male and female. They also have use of the sports and aquatic centre for post match recovery sessions. Occasionally Sydney FC have been seen after home games having recovery sessions at local beaches such as Coogee Beach, Bondi Beach, and Maroubra.

Sydney FC is the most supported A-League club in Australia, with an estimated 693,000 fans as of 2023.

As they were the only A-League team from Sydney until 2012, Sydney FC draws support from across all of Greater Sydney. The main supporter group of Sydney FC is known as &quot;The Cove&quot;, and were originally located at the Paddington (northern) end of Allianz Stadium in bays 22–26. The name came from the original name given to the colonial settlement of Sydney—Sydney Cove.

Cove members attend every home match and travel around the country to support the team at away matches as a vocal group. On 7 July 2006, Australian rock singer Jimmy Barnes recorded a club song entitled &#x27;Sydney FC for Me&#x27; with 25 members of The Cove singing back-up vocals. It was released prior to the start of the 2006–07 season.

The Cove was directly involved the creation of the modern Sydney FC badge, with them putting forward designs and ideas which carried over to the finished product.

<text>Tyrone Templeton is a Canadian comic book artist and writer who has drawn a number of mainstream titles, TV-associated titles, and his own series.

==Career==

Templeton first received attention for &quot;Stig&#x27;s Inferno&quot; (Vortex Comics), now a cult favourite, which detailed the journey of its lead character into Hell in a parody of Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. Templeton recalled that after reading the three books of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;I fell in love with them as stories. It took a bit to get past the language translations, but for a year or so, I was reading different versions, off and on, as my reading on subways and buses, getting to and from school.&quot; Templeton first transferred this inspiration into comic book form with the intent of making it a strip in his campus newspaper, but ended up shelving the project until Vortex publisher William P. Marks suggested that he make it into a series. According to Marks, of the five series that Vortex was publishing at the time, &quot;Stig&#x27;s Inferno&quot; was the most consistently produced on schedule.

He has gone on to do titles for Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Bongo Comics, and Moonstone Books, including &quot;Batman Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and many others. He also created his own graphic novel, &quot;Bigg Time&quot;, published by DC Comics&#x27; mature readers imprint, Vertigo. He was recently editor of an independent Canadian comic company, Mr. Comics. Recent work includes writing and drawing stories for DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman 66&quot;, based on the 1960s television series. He teaches classes in comic book writing and drawing, known as &quot;Ty Templeton&#x27;s Comic Book Boot Camp&quot;.

==Personal life==
Templeton was born on May 9, 1962. He is the brother of internet pioneer and entrepreneur Brad Templeton, and son of Canadian celebrities Charles Templeton and Sylvia Murphy. He lives in Ontario, Canada.

On June 14, 2021, Templeton announced that he had been diagnosed with stage-three colorectal cancer; on October 13, 2022, he announced that he was cancer-free.

<text>Kings Hill is a civil parish in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, England. It is one of several new villages built in Kent since the 1950s (other examples including Vigo and New Ash Green). Development started in 1989 near West Malling, on land previously occupied by RAF West Malling which was operational during both world wars. The plan was for a multi-purpose site of both residential and office/business space.

Parts of the 2007 Channel 4 drama series &quot;Cape Wrath&quot; were shot in the village.

==Development==

Liberty Property Trust carried out the principal development of the site, commencing on the old West Malling airfield site in 1989. The ultimate aim is to have some 2,750 homes and 2 million square feet (186,000 m²) of commercial properties. As of 2010, 2000 homes have been built along with of business space. The development precipitated a major expansion of the A228 which passes the village.

The oldest parts of Kings Hill are around Worcester Avenue and Discovery Drive. Phase 2 is around Beacon Avenue to the north and there is also a Phase 3

Construction of houses and other buildings is set to continue in Kings Hill as Kent County Council have purchased new land for building. In May 2010 plans were unveiled for the re-development of the old airfield&#x27;s derelict control tower (now a listed building) and the surrounding area, which, as of 2016, now plays host to a Costa Coffee and an office for Liberty staff.

Many of the roads in Kings Hill are named after varieties of apple, a fruit which has been grown in Kent for centuries, including Bovarde Avenue, Braeburn Way, Discovery Drive, Melrose Avenue, Pippin Way, Winston Avenue and Worcester Avenue. Others pay homage to the site&#x27;s past use as an RAF WWII aerodrome, with names such as Typhoon Road, Mosquito Road, Hurricane Road, Spitfire Road, Beaufighter Road, Javelin Road, Lancaster Way, Lysander Road, Meteor Road and Mustang Road.

===Community facilities===
There are three primary schools in the estate (Kings Hill Primary, the Discovery School and Valley Invicta).

Other facilities include Kings Hill Sports Park, an Asda superstore, a Little Waitrose, an Aldi, a Shepherd Neame pub named &quot;The Spitfire&quot;, a doctor&#x27;s surgery, a veterinary surgery, opticians, pharmacist, traditional and eastern restaurants, takeaways, cafes, two churches and a David Lloyd Leisure health club.

Kings Hill is served by St Gabriel&#x27;s Church of England church, which currently meets in the Discovery School. Kings Hill falls predominantly within the ecclesiastical parishes of Mereworth and West Malling. In 2003 the Diocese of Rochester appointed the first full-time resident minister to meet the pastoral needs of the growing business and residential community. In 2015 they appointed their second full-time minister.

===Public art===

The development features a number of major sculptures commissioned by the developers. On the roundabout between the business park and the residential area is &quot;A different ball game&quot; by Kevin Atherton which consists of a diameter reflective ball being pushed in different directions by three life-size bronze figures which were cast from local people. On the A228 roundabout to the north of the business park is a tall obelisk style sculpture called &quot;L&#x27;Ambiente&quot; created by Enzo Torcoletti. Smaller sculptures on the site include a statue depiction of a tug of war game on the roundabout near to Kings Hill Primary and memorials to Group Captain Peter Townsend and Bill Rouse, late chairman of the site&#x27;s developers.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp is an aircraft engine of the reciprocating type that was widely used in American aircraft from the 1920s onward. It was the Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft company&#x27;s first engine, and the first of the famed Wasp series. It was a single-row, nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial design, and displaced 1,344 cubic inches (22 L); bore and stroke were both 5.75 in (146 mm). A total of 34,966 engines were produced.

As well as numerous types of fixed-wing aircraft, it was used to power helicopters, the Agusta-Bell AB.102 and the Sikorsky H-19, and a class of airship, the K-class blimp.

In 2016, it received designation as a Historic Engineering Landmark from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

<doc id="1113966" wikidata="Q3131285" url="?curid=1113966" title="Punk ideologies">
<text>Punk ideologies are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the punk subculture and punk rock. It is primarily concerned with concepts such as mutual aid, against selling out, hierarchy, white supremacy, authoritarianism, eugenics, class and classism, while supporting anti-consumerism, anti-corporatism, anti-war, anti-imperialism, leftism, anti-globalization, anti-gentrification, anti-racism, anti-sexism, gender equality, anti-homophobia, racial equality, animal rights, free-thought and non-conformity. One of its main tenets is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It continues to evolve its ideology as the movement spreads throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embraces a range of anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk does not necessarily lend itself to any particular political ideology as it is primarily anti-establishment although leftist punk is more common due to the prevalence of liberal and conservative ideologies in the status-quo.

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through punk rock music and lyrics, punk literature such as amateur fanzines, spoken word performances or recordings, punk fashion, or punk visual art. Some punks have participated in direct action, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction, and indirect action through counter-propaganda, protests or boycotts. They support and squat in urban and rural collective houses, with group funds held in common. Punk fashion was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the status quo. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear accessories, clothing or have tattoos that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives, such as D.O.A&#x27;s Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear secondhand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to selling out, which refers to abandoning of one&#x27;s values and/or a change in musical style toward pop (e.g. electropop) and embracing mainstream culture or more radio-friendly rock (e.g. pop rock) in exchange for wealth, status, or power. The issue of authenticity is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term &quot;poseur&quot; is applied to those who try to associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying core values or philosophy.

Because anti-establishment attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of independent record labels, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of major labels. The do it yourself (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression DIY was coined by commentators after the fact.

== Specific ideologies and philosophies ==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

=== Anarchism ===
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed &quot;peace punks&quot; or &quot;anarcho-punks.&quot; While some well-known punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Exploited had songs about anarchy, notably the Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;, they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.

Anarcho-punks typically believe in direct action. Many anarcho-punks are pacifists (e.g. Crass and Discharge) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, squatting, applying legal graffiti, culture jamming, ecotage, freeganism, boycotting, civil disobedience, hacktivism and subvertising. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. Conflict). This manifests itself as rioting, illegal graffiti, vandalism, wire cutting, hunt sabotage, participation in Class War-style activities, melee weapons and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: Aus-Rotten, Dave Insurgent, Crass, Subhumans, Colin Jerwood, and Dave Dictor.

=== Animal rights and veganism ===

In the 1980s, both straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom started to become associated with animal rights. This association was made possible through activism by bands such as Napalm Death, Icons of Filth, Conflict, and Electro Hippies. Some musicians in these bands were vegans and vegetarians themselves and publicly advocated for these ideologies. In addition to this, bands at the forefront of this movement included lyrical themes pertaining to animal rights, vegetarianism and veganism. Consequently, these ideas became a feature of the punk subculture and this association continues on into the 21st century. A notable example is Jack McGarry of the band SX-70 citing messages of animal rights in lyrics of music he listened to as an influence in becoming vegan. It is additionally evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.

=== Apoliticism ===
Some punks claim to be adherents to apoliticism, such as the band Charged GBH and the singer GG Allin, although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song &quot;Violence Now&quot;. Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include glam punk, psychobilly, horror punk, punk pathetique, death rock and pop punk. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including The Dictators, Ramones (which featured staunch conservative Johnny Ramone alongside liberal activist Joey Ramone), New York Dolls, Television, Johnny Thunders&#x27; Heartbreakers, and Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids.

=== Christianity ===

Christian punk is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the Christian music industry, while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently Crashdog, Showbread (band), Ballydowse and The Psalters, the latter three of whom identified as Christian anarchists. Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include Altar Boys, The Crucified, Five Iron Frenzy, Flatfoot 56, Side Walk Slam, and pop-punk band MxPx, who earned a gold record in 1998.

=== Conservatism ===

A moderate number of punk bands and artists are conservative, rejecting liberalism, communism and socialism in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include Johnny Ramone, Dee Dee Ramone, Cherie Currie, Forgotten Rebels, John Kezdy, Billy Zoom, Exene Cervenka, Joe Escalante, Bobby Steele, Ross the Boss, Duane Peters, Leonard Graves Phillips, John Knight, Jon Moss, Lee Ving, Klamydia, Dave Smalley, U.S. Chaos, Cro-Mags, and Agnostic Front. John Lydon of the Sex Pistols has also expressed some conservative views as early as the 80s. During the 1980 United States presidential election, Iggy Pop became a vocal supporter of Ronald Reagan. Ian Curtis of the post-punk quartet Joy Division was a loyal Conservative voter who not only voted for Margaret Thatcher in 1979 but persuaded the Liberal candidate to give him a lift to the polling station in order to do so.

Some Christian punk and hardcore bands have conservative political stances, in particular some of the NYHC bands.

=== Environmentalism ===
=== Feminism ===

Riot grrrl is an underground subcultural feminist punk movement that combines feminism, punk music and politics. It began during the early 1990s within the United States in Olympia, Washington, and the greater Pacific Northwest. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the riot grrrl movement, and has recently been seen in current fourth-wave feminist punk music. Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, classism, anarchism, and often contain themes of female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily&#x27;s Sassy Lime and Sleater-Kinney, small italian band Pankhurst, as well as queercore groups such as Team Dresch and the Third Sex.

=== Hare Krishna ===

The Filipino punk band the Wuds which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to Hare Krishna movement. In the 1990s, some notable members of the New York hardcore scene, including Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter and other bands), John Joseph (Cro-Mags) and Harley Flanagan (Cro-Mags) converted to Hare Krishna. This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

=== Islam ===

Taqwacore is a punk subgenre, many of whose members are Muslim artists who live in the West.

=== Liberalism ===
Liberal punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning and are mostly on the liberal left. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: Fat Mike of NOFX, Ted Leo, Green Day, Crashdog, Dropkick Murphys, Hoxton Tom McCourt, Jared Gomes of Hed PE, Tim Armstrong of Rancid and Tim McIlrath of Rise Against. Liberal ideologies in punk music are most notably found in the lyrical content of these songs. While viewpoints typically associated with liberals (such as being anti-war) can be seen within the lyrical content of some punk songs, they are also sometimes endorsed by musicians in public statements and interviews as well. Some liberal punks also participated in the Rock Against Bush movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate John Kerry.

=== Neo-Nazism ===

Nazi punks have a white nationalist ideology that is closely related to that of white power skinheads. Ian Stuart Donaldson and his band Skrewdriver are credited with popularizing white power rock and hatecore (for its hateful lyrical themes), or Rock Against Communism. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux, who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as swastikas for shock or comedy value. &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off&quot; is a song by the Dead Kennedys, an American punk rock band, and is often considered the most famous song regarding nazi punk. The song was released in 1981 and was written in response to the rise of neo-Nazi and far-right punks that had started attending Dead Kennedy shows in response to their satirical song &quot;Kill the Poor&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off&quot; condemn the presence of far-right and fascist punks attending their shows, calling out individuals who espouse racist, sexist, and homophobic beliefs. The song&#x27;s chorus is a direct call to action, urging punk fans to reject and expel these hateful elements from their community.

=== Nihilism ===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, nihilism was a fixture in some early punk rock and protopunk. The Sex Pistols were central to the association of punk and nihilism, with the &quot;Trouser Press Record Guide&quot; writing that their &quot;confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands.&quot; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though &quot;much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said&quot;, so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
The Situationist International (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the United Kingdom. Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. Malcolm McLaren introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band Sex Pistols. Vivienne Westwood, McLaren&#x27;s partner and the band&#x27;s designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around Hulme and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as &#x27;psycho-spectre&#x27;. Jamie Reid&#x27;s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

=== Socialism ===
The Clash were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing socialism to the punk scene. Clash frontman Joe Strummer said of his socialist views &quot;I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and &#x27;I&#x27;m alright jack&#x27; and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m from and there&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve made my decisions from. That&#x27;s why I believe in socialism.&quot; Some of the original Oi! bands expressed a rough form of socialist working class populism — often mixed with patriotism. Many Oi! bands sang about unemployment, economic inequality, working class power and police harassment. In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with Red Wedge. Notable socialist punks include: Attila the Stockbroker, Billy Bragg, Bruce La Bruce, Garry Bushell (until the late 1980s), Chris Dean, Gary Floyd, Jack Grisham, Stewart Home, Dennis Lyxzén, Thomas Mensforth, Fermin Muguruza, Alberto Pla, Tom Robinson, Seething Wells, Paul Simmonds, Rob Tyner, Joe Strummer, Ian Svenonius, Mark Steel and Paul Weller (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: &quot;... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function&quot;.

=== Straight edge ===

Straight edge originated in the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene with the Minor Threat song &quot;Straight Edge&quot; written by frontman Ian MacKaye and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drug use. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from caffeine, casual sex and meat. Those stricter individuals may be considered part of the hardline subculture. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label, but it became a movement one which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: Tim McIlrath, CM Punk and Davey Havok.

<text>Janet &quot;Jenny&quot; Geddes (c. 1600 – c. 1660) was a Scottish market-trader in Edinburgh who is alleged to have thrown a stool at the head of the minister in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in objection to the first public use of the Church of Scotland&#x27;s revised version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the 1637 &quot;Scottish Prayer Book&quot;. The act is reputed to have sparked the riot that led to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which included the English Civil War.

==Background==

Since the early years of the 17th century, the Church of Scotland had been established as an episcopal church on the same basis as the Church of England, but was far more Puritan both in doctrine and practice. In 1633, King Charles I came to St Giles&#x27; to have his Scottish coronation service, using the full Anglican rites, accompanied by William Laud, his new Archbishop of Canterbury. In the years that followed, he began to consider ways of introducing Anglican-style church services in Scotland. The king arranged a commission to draw up a prayer book suitable for Scotland, and in 1637 an Edinburgh printer produced:

These developments met with widespread opposition.

==Incident==
The first use of the prayer book was in St Giles&#x27; on Sunday, 23 July 1637, when James Hannay, Dean of Edinburgh, began to read the Collects, part of the prescribed service, and Geddes, a market-woman or street-seller, threw her stool straight at the minister&#x27;s head. Some sources describe it as a &quot;fald stool&quot; or a &quot;creepie-stool&quot;, while others claim that it was a larger, three-legged cuttie-stool. As she hurled the stool she is reported to have yelled: &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;The Devil give you colic! The hide of you! &quot;(lit. &quot;the belly of you&quot;)&quot; False thief! You dare say the Mass in my ear?&quot;

This was the start of a general tumult with much of the congregation shouting abuse and throwing Bibles, stools, sticks and stones. John Prebble reports the phrase &quot;Daur ye say Mass in my lug?&quot; as being addressed to a gentleman in the congregation who murmured a dutiful response to the liturgy, getting thumped with a Bible for his pains, and describes Jenny as one of a number of &quot;waiting-women&quot; who were paid to arrive early and sit on their folding stools to hold a place for their patrons. Officers summoned by the Provost ejected the rioters, who, for the rest of the service, stayed to hammer at the doors and throw stones at the windows.
More serious rioting in the streets (and in other cities) followed, and the provost and magistrates were besieged in the City Chambers, to the extent that it became necessary to negotiate with the Edinburgh mob. At the suggestion of the Lord Advocate, Thomas Hope, it appointed a committee known as &quot;the Tables&quot; to negotiate with the Privy Council. Characteristically, Charles turned down the Tables&#x27; demands for withdrawal of the Anglican liturgy and more riots ensued with talk of civil war. This led to widespread signing of the National Covenant in February 1638, with its defiance of any attempt to introduce innovations like the prayer book that had not first been subject to the scrutiny of Parliament and the general assembly of the church. In November of the same year, the bishops and archbishops were formally expelled from the Church of Scotland, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis. Charles reacted by launching the Bishops&#x27; Wars, thus beginning the Wars of Three Kingdoms.

In the aftermath of the riots definitive evidence is hard to come by, and some doubt if Geddes started the fight or if she even existed, but she remains a part of Edinburgh tradition and has long had a memorial in St Giles. The sculpture that was added recently shows a three-legged cuttie-stool rather than a folding stool. Lord Barrett of Newburgh wrote of the riot on 29 August 1637, &quot;I hear they were by the women beaten out of the church with their little stools (which it seems their custom is to sit upon).&quot;

Around 1787, Robert Burns named his mare after Geddes and wrote amusingly of this faithful horse.

==Commemoration==

In 1886 a plaque was erected to Geddes&#x27;s memory in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. It was paid for by the philanthropist Robert Halliday Gunning.

<text>Gerald Allan Sohl Sr. (December 2, 1913 – November 4, 2002) was an American television scriptwriter and science fiction author who wrote for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (as a ghostwriter for Charles Beaumont), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (once using the pseudonym &quot;Nathan Butler&quot;), and other shows. He wrote more than twenty novels as well as feature film scripts. He also wrote the nonfiction works &quot;Underhanded Chess&quot; and &quot;Underhanded Bridge&quot; in 1973.

==Novels==
&quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Villiers Gerson described his 1953 novel &quot;The Transcendent Man&quot; as &quot;contain[ing] enough twists to afford the reader a few hours&#x27; entertainment&quot; despite being &quot;oversimplified in motivation.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller found the plot unconvincing. Gerson later panned Sohl&#x27;s &quot;The Altered Ego&quot;, saying &quot;This wordy book lacks characterization, emotion, suspense, and interest.&quot;

His 1955 &quot;Point Ultimate&quot; is a piece of Cold War invasion literature: in 1999, a faraway future history at the time of writing, the US lies under a cruel Soviet occupation, reinforced by a deadly artificial disease which makes conquered Americans dependent on the conquerors for the injections that keep them alive.

In &quot;The Time Dissolver&quot; (1957), a man and a woman wake one morning to find that they have lost all memory of the past eleven years, including how they met and became married.

==Ghostwriting==

As Charles Beaumont became increasingly ill from a mysterious brain illness, possibly Pick&#x27;s disease or very early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s, and unable to write, Sohl ghostwrote three episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; for him. These were &quot;The New Exhibit&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Nile&quot; and &quot;Living Doll&quot;. Beaumont insisted on splitting the fees for each episode.

<text>This list gives the number of distinct land borders of each country or territory, as well as the neighbouring countries and territories. The length of each border is included, as is the total length of each country&#x27;s or territory&#x27;s borders.

Countries or territories that are connected only by man-made structures such as bridges, causeways or tunnels are not considered to have land borders. However, borders along lakes, rivers, and other internal waters are considered land borders for the purposes of this article.

==Land borders==
Distinct Land Borders: Refers to the number of separate geographic boundaries a country shares with its neighbors. A single country may have multiple distinct land borders with the same neighbour (e.g., due to enclaves, exclaves, or disconnected regions).

Distinct Land Neighbours: Refers to the number of unique countries a nation borders via land.

**: 14 (16 if and are included)

== Artificial border crossings ==
In addition to the above number of land borders per country, some countries have a man-made bridge, causeway or tunnel between each other without having any proper land border. These artificial land borders are usually less than long.

<doc id="1113983" wikidata="Q619878" url="?curid=1113983" title="If You Leave Me Now">
<text>&quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; is a song by the American rock group Chicago, from their album &quot;Chicago X&quot;. It was written and sung by bass player Peter Cetera and released as a single on July 30, 1976. It is also the title of a Chicago compilation album released by Columbia Records (Columbia 38590) in 1983.

The single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on October 23, 1976, and stayed there for two weeks, making it the first number one hit for the group. It hit the number one on the Easy Listening charts and was also Chicago&#x27;s biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in other countries such as the UK, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Netherlands. In the UK, it maintained the number one position for three weeks. It was one of five &quot;non-disco&quot; songs to make it to number one in the US in a nine-month period of 1976. According to writer Zachary Houle of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;The song was so pervasive on radio upon its release that, reportedly, those tuning in in New York could hear the song playing on four different stations, each with varying formats, simultaneously.&quot;

The song won Grammy Awards for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) (strings) for arranger Jimmie Haskell and producer James William Guercio and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, the first Grammy Award won by the group. It also received a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year. In addition, by August 1978 it had sold 1.4 million copies in the United States alone. It has been certified gold and platinum by the RIAA.

In 2010 Chicago teamed with the American Cancer Society and offered the opportunity to bid on the chance to sing their hit, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; with them on stage live at their concerts, with proceeds going to the American Cancer Society to fight breast cancer. The fund raising effort has continued in succeeding years.

Peter Cetera originally wrote &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; at the same time as &quot;Chicago VII&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;, and composed it on a guitar. According to information on the sheet music for the song at MusicNotes, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; is written in the key of B major, and Cetera&#x27;s vocal range varies between F sharp 3 (F♯3) and D sharp 5 (D♯5).

Band manager James William Guercio initially played acoustic guitar on the demo version of the track, figuring that regular guitarist Terry Kath would record the proper part when he was in the studio next. However, the band decided that Guercio&#x27;s part sounded satisfactory and consequently left that effort on the record. Walter Parazaider recalled that he heard the song on the radio while cleaning his pool and initially thought &quot;it sounded like McCartney,&quot; not realizing it was his own band&#x27;s work.

== Promotion and marketing ==
The &quot;Chicago X&quot; album art depicted a partially unwrapped chocolate bar bearing the Chicago logo. In the same vein, the single, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, was depicted as a chocolate &quot;kiss&quot; from the album in a full-page advertisement in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine. 

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it&#x27;s &quot;an excellent ballad,&quot; with &quot;lushly colored&quot; instrumentation and &quot;carefully constructed&quot; vocals. &quot;Record World&quot; called it &quot;a good single choice&quot; with a &quot;strong vocal line.&quot; In an article from June 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; as number 73 on its list of &quot;The Greatest UK No 1s: 100–1&quot;, noting, &quot;It’s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting.&quot;

Upon the group&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016, entertainment and pop culture writer Troy L. Smith included &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; in his list of seven Chicago songs that &quot;kill any doubt about their candidacy&quot;, and said, &quot;...it&#x27;s a key contributor to the band&#x27;s fame and, thus, its Rock Hall induction. And while we&#x27;re being honest, Peter Cetera delivers, hands down, the best vocal performance of any Chicago song.&quot;

== In other media ==
&quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; is featured in the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; (appearing on the in-game radio station Los Santos Rock Radio), and is also played when Trevor Philips returns the kidnapped wife of a drug kingpin.
The song is also featured in the episodes, &quot;Casa Bonita&quot; and &quot;Awesom-O&quot;, of South Park, as well as &quot;Egg Drop&quot;, the 12th episode of the third season of the American sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot;. The song was also featured in a scene on the British comedy horror film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; where Shaun is still reeling from his breakup and Ed is trying to cheer him up. In the early 2000&#x27;s, the song was performed by the mascot &quot;Sockpuppet&quot; in a commercial for the now-defunct website Pets.com. &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; was part of the soundtrack for the 1999 film, &quot;Three Kings&quot;, which is set in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Desson Howe, reviewing the film for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, notes how film director David O. Russell cuts from the &quot;frenzied din of confusion&quot; outside a moving car in the scene to the interior of the car, where the &quot;easy sounds&quot; of the song are playing. The song was also featured in the 2023 film &quot;The Flash,&quot; which is an installment in the DC Extended Universe&quot;.&quot;The song is also featured in the season 6 episode “Boy, Interrupted” of the HBO show Sex and the City. It plays at the end of the episode when Carrie attends the Gay and Lesbian Prom.

In the HBO miniseries, &quot;The Regime&quot;, the dictator portrayed by Kate Winslet sings a &quot;cringy&quot; rendition of &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; in the initial episode which first aired on March 3, 2024. In an interview with Patrick Ryan of USA Today, Winslet discussed the song selection: &quot;It’s such a great metaphor... I thought that song choice was very much to do with her trying to express her gratitude for her loyal followers. It&#x27;s a fantastic play on the world of ‘likes,’ and how she’s a leader by social media more than anything.” In the same article, series creator Will Tracey said the song was written into the very first draft, &#x27; “I was trying to think of an American song that might’ve hit the airwaves in Europe when she was a kid: something seemingly innocuous and maudlin and soft rock. But I always felt there’s something in that rising hook in the melody; there’s a sadness contained in a lot of those seemingly vacuous radio ballads. So it seemed like the right song to mine for a ridiculous moment at the top of the show,” but one that also becomes “strangely poignant” by the series’ end.&#x27;

In the fall of 2024, the song was used in tv commercials for Canadian Tire in Canada.

<text>The East Rand is a major urban area located in the Gauteng province of South Africa. It is the urban eastern part of Witwatersrand that is functionally merged with the Johannesburg conurbation. The region extends from Alberton in the west to Springs in the east, and south down to Nigel. It includes the towns of Bedfordview, Benoni, Boksburg, Brakpan, Edenvale, Germiston, Kempton Park, Linksfield and Modderfontein. The East Rand is known as the transport hub of Johannesburg and includes Africa&#x27;s largest and second busiest airport, OR Tambo International Airport.

After the end of apartheid, the municipal governments of the towns of the East Rand were combined (excluding Modderfontein and Linksfield), and eventually merged into a single administration: the City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality.

==History==
This area became settled by Europeans after a gold-bearing reef was discovered in 1886 and sparked the gold rush that gave rise to the establishment of Johannesburg. 
As part of the restructuring of municipalities in South Africa at the time, the local governments of the East Rand (excluding Modderfontein and Linksfield) were merged into a single municipality in 1999, called the City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (&quot;ekurhuleni&quot; meaning &quot;place of peace&quot; in Tsonga).

Despite having a separate municipal government, like the West Rand, the East Rand is included as part of the Witwatersrand urban area. To this end, the East Rand shares the same dialling code as Johannesburg (011 locally) and the same metropolitan route numbering system as Johannesburg (and the West Rand). It is not uncommon for residents of the East Rand to work in Johannesburg proper and vice versa.

<text>The Sovereign State of Aeterna Lucina (also known as the Sovereign Humanitarian Mission State of Aeterna Lucina), was an Australian micronation. It was founded in 1978, and continued until the death of its founder.
The founder and &quot;Supreme Lord&quot; of Aeterna Lucina was German migrant Paul Neuman, who changed his name by deed poll to Paul Baron Neuman. He founded it when living in Byron Bay, and later moved it with him to Curl Curl in Sydney, and finally Cooma. He claimed to have received the title Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh from the exiled former king Hassan III of Afghanistan and also claimed to have been awarded hundreds of other honours, including professorships, Doctorates of Philosophy, and degrees in divinity. He sold at least one &quot;knighthood&quot;.

Aeterna Lucina came to public attention in 1990 when Neuman faced fraud charges in the New South Wales court system relating to land sale offences. The case involved A$144,000 and was eventually abandoned in 1992.

<doc id="1114004" wikidata="Q5229762" url="?curid=1114004" title="Dave Sands">
<text>Dave Sands (born David Ritchie; 4 February 1926 – 11 August 1952) was an Australian professional boxer.

The man the Americans called the &quot;boxer with the educated left hand&quot; received his due when he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998 at a ceremony held in Los Angeles, recognised as one of the greatest boxers never to have won a world title.

Sands was the 2009 Inductee for the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame Veterans category.

==Early life==
He was born at Burnt Bridge Mission in Kempsey, New South Wales, the fifth of eight children of George Ritchie, a rodeo-rider and timber-cutter of mixed Aboriginal and European descent, and his Aboriginal wife Mabel, née Russell.

Sands&#x27; brothers Clement, Percival, George, Alfred and Russell also boxed, emulating their father and their maternal great-uncle Bailey Russell, a noted bare-knuckle fighter. In 1939, Percy travelled to Newcastle to train with Tom Maguire. At age 15, Sands joined Percy training with Maguire and both lived at Maguire&#x27;s gym. He and his five brothers took on the Sands name, taken from train guard &quot;Snowy&quot; Sands who helped Percy travel fare-free to fight in 1940.

==Career==
Without Maguire&#x27;s knowledge, Dave fought a four-round preliminary bout in August 1941 at Newcastle Stadium, swinging his way to victory in the first round. Maguire disapproved, but quickly transformed him into a skilled boxer. By the end of 1942, he had knocked out a dozen opponents at Newcastle. On 11 August 1945, he married 18-year-old Bessie Emma Burns at St Paul&#x27;s Church of England, Stockton, New South Wales.

Sands was soon boxing in twelve-round matches before excited crowds of up to ten thousand people in Brisbane and Sydney. In May 1946, he defeated Jack Kirkham for the Australian middleweight title. Three months later, he knocked out Jack Johnson in four rounds to become national light-heavyweight champion. The rematches were even more one-sided: Kirkham was defeated in five rounds and Johnson fell after 2½ minutes of furious punching. By 1948, Sands had beaten all his local opponents and most American &#x27;imports&#x27;. His mauling of a French fighter Tony Toniolo in less than two minutes in February 1949 led the English promoter Jack Solomons to take an interest in him.

Despite an enthusiastic reception from the British press, Sands began his campaign for a world title disastrously. In London on 4 April 1949, while suffering from a swollen, recently vaccinated arm, he was outpointed by Tommy Yarosz. Fifteen days later Sands won, dismally, against a spoiler, Lucien Caboche. Maguire then moved him to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where friendly locals and a promoter Joe Shepherd restored his confidence. After two solid victories, he returned to London and in July thrashed the much-fancied Robert Villemain in the &#x27;fight of the year&#x27;. On 6 September, Sands demolished Dick Turpin in 2 minutes 35 seconds for the British Empire middleweight title.

Shortly after his triumphal return to Australia in November 1949, Sands survived a serious accident when the steering on his motorcar failed, and the vehicle somersaulted into a creek. Over the next eighteen months, he contested and won nine fights, one of them a fifteen-rounder in September 1950 in which he took the Australian heavyweight championship from Alf Gallagher. Sands had become a leading contender for the world middleweight title and Maguire vainly sought to arrange a bout with the American champion Sugar Ray Robinson. In the tricky maze of international boxing promotion, his efforts were marked by a paper chase of offers and counter-offers. Sands defeated Mel Brown in London in July 1951 in a preliminary to a title fight between Robinson and another contender Randolph Turpin. Had Maguire&#x27;s negotiations succeeded, Sands would have been in Turpin&#x27;s place and probably would have beaten an unfit Robinson, as did Turpin.

In October 1951, Sands won two fights in the United States. Back home, he hoped for a world title-bout, but he was estranged from Maguire. A new manager Bede Kerr reopened discussions with Robinson&#x27;s connections, but the chance never came.

==Death==
On 11 August 1952, the truck Sands was driving with 15 passengers overturned at roadworks near Dungog, New South Wales. Sands died of head and internal injuries that evening in the local hospital and was buried at Sandgate Cemetery, near Newcastle, New South Wales. His wife, and their son and two daughters survived him; their third daughter was born in November. Sands had earned about £30,000, but it went on manager&#x27;s fees, travel costs, tax, family expenses and generosity to his kin. A public appeal raised more than £2500, sufficient to pay off his Stockton home and create a trust fund for his family.

<doc id="1114005" wikidata="Q3123493" url="?curid=1114005" title="Geology of the Capitol Reef area">
<text>The exposed geology of the Capitol Reef area presents a record of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in an area of North America in and around Capitol Reef National Park, on the Colorado Plateau in southeastern Utah.

Nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 m) of sedimentary strata are found in the Capitol Reef area, representing nearly 200 million years of geologic history of the south-central part of the U.S. state of Utah. These rocks range in age from Permian (as old as 270 million years old) to Cretaceous (as young as 80 million years old.) Rock layers in the area reveal ancient climates as varied as rivers and swamps (Chinle Formation), Sahara-like deserts (Navajo Sandstone), and shallow ocean (Mancos Shale).

The area&#x27;s first known sediments were laid down as a shallow sea invaded the land in the Permian. At first sandstone was deposited but limestone followed as the sea deepened. After the sea retreated in the Triassic, streams deposited silt before the area was uplifted and underwent erosion. Conglomerate followed by logs, sand, mud and wind-transported volcanic ash were later added. Mid to Late Triassic time saw increasing aridity, during which vast amounts of sandstone were laid down along with some deposits from slow-moving streams. As another sea started to return, it periodically flooded the area and left evaporite deposits. Barrier islands, sand bars and later, tidal flats, contributed sand for sandstone, followed by cobbles for conglomerate, and mud for shale. The sea retreated, leaving streams, lakes and swampy plains to become the resting place for sediments. Another sea, the Western Interior Seaway, returned in the Cretaceous and left more sandstone and shale only to disappear in the early Cenozoic.

From 70 to 50 million years ago the Laramide orogeny, a major mountain building event in western North America, created the Rocky Mountains to the east. The uplift possibly acted on a buried fault to form the area&#x27;s Waterpocket Fold. More recent uplift of the entire Colorado Plateau and the resulting erosion has exposed this fold at the surface only within the last 15 to 20 million years. Ice ages in the Pleistocene increased the rate of precipitation and erosion. The cracked upper parts of the Waterpocket Fold were especially affected and the fold itself was exposed and dissected.
==Primary deposition of sediments==
Some important concepts: A &quot;formation&quot; is a formally named and defined geologic unit with unique characteristics. Those characteristics were created during a largely unbroken period of time and result from the specific depositional environment that the formation was laid down in. A &quot;member&quot; is a minor unit in a formation and a &quot;bed&quot; is a distinct subunit of a member. &quot;Groups&quot; are sets of formations that are related in significant ways such as, for example, all being deposited during a dry period that lasted millions of years or as the result of an ocean periodically flooding the same area over millions of years.

The various kinds of &quot;unconformities&quot; are gaps in the geologic record. Such gaps can be due to a prolonged absence of deposition or due to subsequent erosion that removes previously deposited rock units. The following sections are ordered from oldest to youngest rock units in order to create a geologic history of events. This is the opposite order one would see in an actual cross section of the sediments because newer rock units are deposited on top of older ones per the law of superposition.

===Cutler and Kaibab formations (Permian)===

In early Permian time, Utah was on a continental shelf that was occasionally covered by a shallow arm of the Panthalassa Ocean. That part of Laurasia was on a passive continental margin not unlike the current west coast of equatorial Africa. The resultant formations are part of the approximately 290- to 250-million-year-old Cutler Formation (called a group locally) Utah was nearly on the paleoequator while the first members of the Cutler Formation were deposited but it had migrated nearly to 10° north latitude by around 275 million years ago. The Cutler records sedimentation during this time and is composed of four members (youngest to oldest):
*White Rim Sandstone, (resistant caprock)
*Organ Rock Shale (locally missing),
*Cedar Mesa Sandstone, and the
*Elephant Canyon (locally buried).

Only the two sandstone members of the Cutler Formation, the Cedar Mesa and White Rim, are exposed in the park but they cannot be easily distinguished from each other and are thus often treated as a single stratigraphic unit there. The White Rim and Cedar Mesa are composed of fossilized cross-bedded sand dunes that were likely deposited in an arid coastal environment that periodically flooded with sea water. Sand in these formations are somewhat sorted by size, well-rounded (worn by abrasion), and range from very fine- to medium-grained.

Good outcrops of the locally 800 foot (240 m) thick Cedar Mesa and 420 foot (128 m) thick White Rim can be found in the bottom of Sulphur Creek and at the bottom of the Circle Cliffs outside the park&#x27;s western border. In other areas the Organ Rock Shale is between the Cedar Mesa and White Rim but it pinches out east of the park. Both the locally buried Elephant Canyon and missing Organ Rock are exposed in nearby Canyonlands National Park 60 miles (100 km) east (see geology of the Canyonlands area).

Later in Permian time, the Kaibab Sea invaded the land and laid down a limey ooze that later lithified to form the locally up to 200 foot (60 m) thick Kaibab Limestone. This is the same light gray to white formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest (see Geology of the Grand Canyon area). The lower parts of the Kaibab were interbedded with sand and silt before its main component, limestone, was converted into chert-rich dolomite by the intrusion of magnesium. The formation contains fossils of invertebrates including brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods. Outcrops of the cliff-forming Kaibab in Capitol Reef can only be seen in the deeper canyons located in the westernmost part of the park. Retreat of the Kaibab Sea by the Mid Permian exposed its seabed to erosion, resulting in 100 foot (30 m) deep channels and the creation of a gap in the geologic record called an unconformity.

===Moenkopi Formation (Triassic)===

Local climatic conditions were wetter and more tropical in the Early Triassic than they were previously. In the Capitol Reef area the resulting Moenkopi Formation is divided into four members (from oldest to youngest):
*Black Dragon Member
*Sinbad Limestone Member,
*Torrey Member, and
*Moody Canyon Member.
Distinctive exposures of the uppermost Moenkopi are along the lower slopes of the west-facing cliffs of the Waterpocket Fold. Uplift and subsequent partial erosion of the Moenkopi then created an approximately 6 million year long unconformity that lasted the entire Mid Triassic.

The 50 to 110 foot (15 to 34 m) thick slope-forming Black Dragon is composed of reddish conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone that were likely deposited on a coastal plain followed by a tidal flat. Chert clasts from the underlying Kaibab Limestone make-up part of conglomerates at the member&#x27;s base while ripple marks and mudcracks are common in its upper parts. Also common in the upper parts of the member are thin interbeds of carbonate rock with some fossils.

Later in the early Triassic, fossil-rich to muddy limey ooze with small amounts of silt and sand were laid down as a short-lived arm of the ocean covered the region. This created the locally 70 to 140 foot (21 to 43 m) thick yellowish-colored Sinbad Limestone member of the Moenkopi. Some of the fossils found in this layer include the brachiopod genus &quot;Lingula&quot; and the ammonite genus &quot;Meekoceras&quot;.

A tidal flat briefly returned to the area after the sea retreated. This created the locally 250 to 320 foot (76 to 98 m) thick reddish-brown to chocolate colored siltstone and fine-grained sandstone of the Moenkopi&#x27;s Torrey Member. Some of the finer-grained beds display ripple marks and mudcracks while the sandstone has horizontal and low-angle crossbedding. Small to large fossilized track-ways from amphibians and reptiles are found in this layer as well as casts of halite.

The youngest member of the Moenkopi is the 320 to 430 foot (98 to 130 m) thick Moody Canyon Member. Moody Canyon is informally sub-divided into two units:
*a lower slope-forming 200 to 300 foot (60 to 90 m) thick unit of reddish-brown siltstone and
*an upper cliff-forming 120 to 130 foot (37 to 40 m) thick unit of reddish-orange siltstone.
About 30 to 40% of the stone in the upper unit is ripple-laminated while the lower unit is structureless to horizontally laminated. Good exposures of the ripple-laminated upper unit are found on the lower part of Egyptian Temple.

===Chinle Formation (Triassic)===

A complex, relatively high velocity and likely braided stream system covered most of southern Utah in the Late Triassic. Various members of the resulting Chinle Formation are found over much of the Colorado Plateaus. Logs, sand, mud and wind-transported volcanic ash from distant eruptions were mixed by streams as they migrated over a subsiding basin to form the Chinle. Uranium salts accumulated in this formation in economically extractable quantities and petrified wood was formed (petrification was probably aided by the presence of volcanic ash). Chinle members represented in the Capitol Reef area are (from oldest to youngest):
*Shinarump Member,
*Monitor Butte Member,
*Petrified Forest Member, and
*Owl Rock Member.
Together they form the purple and orange rounded slopes and hills that are occasionally above white cliffs along the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s west face.

Discontinuous beds of sediment were deposited in broad channels eroded into the Moenkopi, creating the locally 0 to 90 foot (0 to 27 m) thick white to yellowish gray cliff-forming Shinarump Member of the Chinle Formation. The Shinarump is made of low to high-angle cross-stratified and friable fine to coarse-grained sandstone interbedded with conglomerate. Good outcrops of the Shinarump are found near the park&#x27;s west entrance capping such features as the Egyptian Temple and Chimney Rock while all traces of this member are absent further east. Members above the Shinarump tend to be finer due to the slower speed of the streams that deposited them.

A river system then migrated northward and transitioned into either a large lake or marsh. As this occurred, bentonite-rich clay (formed in part from volcanic ash erupted from nearby volcanoes) and clayey cross-bedded sand with some interbeds and lenses of lime ooze were laid down. This eventually became the light purplish-gray claystone, sandstone, and carbonate rock of the Chinle&#x27;s Monitor Butte Member. Burrows that measure 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter and 5 feet (1.5 m) long were excavated by lungfish into the Monitor Butte. This member easily stands out in the lower to middle slopes of the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s west face in such places as The Castle and along the cliff&#x27;s just north of State Route 24 as it enters the park.

Very sinuous rivers covered the area in later Triassic time, forming the sediments of the Chinle&#x27;s Petrified Forest Member. The Petrified Forest is composed of reddish-orange bentonite-rich cross-bedded siltstones and clayey fine-grained quartz sandstones. The lower part of this member forms gullied slopes and the upper part forms a resistant cliff called the &#x27;Capitol Reef bed.&#x27; Carbonate nodules along with fossil bivalves, coprolites, marine snails, lungfish toothplates, and tetrapods are found in the Petrified Forest Member.

Deposition from a series of lakes then dominate the geologic record, resulting in the locally 150 to 200 foot (45 to 60 m) thick Owl Rock Member of the Chinle. The Owl Rock is made of purple and orange mudstones, fine-grained sandstones and siltstones with interbedded 1 to 10 foot (30 to 300 cm) thick green to mottled pink micritic and knobby limestone. Fossilized desiccation mudcracks that are up to 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 3 feet (1 m) deep are found at the very top of the Owl Rock (they were later filled with sand from the overlying Wingate Sandstone). Also found in the Owl Rock are trace fossils of cylindrical burrows and fossils of ostracodes. The Owl Rock erodes into littered slopes and is found directly below the Wingate Sandstone along the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s west face.

===Glen Canyon Group (Triassic)===
All three formations of the Glen Canyon Group were laid down in the Mid to Late Triassic during a time of increasing aridity. Slightly clockwise and northward movement of the North American Plate was bringing the area into a dryer climatic belt. The direction of cross-bedding in Glen Canyon Group sand dunes suggests that prevailing winds from the north transported the sand into the region. Outcrops of the Glen Canyon Group&#x27;s three formations are the most prominently exposed rock layers in the spine of the Waterpocket Fold. Together they reach a thickness of 1,500 to 2,700 feet (460 to 820 m) in the area and their sandstones are seen in many of the arches, domes and slot canyons in Capitol Reef. They are, from oldest (lowest) to youngest (highest);
* Wingate Sandstone
* Kayenta Formation
* Navajo Sandstone

Sand dunes migrated back and forth on the shore of the Sundance Sea, creating the 350 foot (107 m) thick cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone. This formation is composed of orange-colored cross bedded fossilized sand dunes made of fine-grained and well-rounded quartz sand. Wingate outcrops are found capping the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s western escarpment. Prominent examples are easy to see near the Visitor Center in the Fruita Cliffs and in The Castle.

The climate became more humid later in Triassic time. Slow-moving, southwestward flowing braided streams laid down thin-bedded layers of sand, silt, mud and cobbles in channels, across low flood plains and in lakes. Fossilized footprints of dinosaurs and the crocodile-like tritylodonts can be found in this 350 foot (107 m) thick ledgy-slope forming formation, called the Kayenta. The Kayenta weathers into three units; a lower ledge and middle cliff that are dominated by cross-bedded sandstone and an upper slope that has relatively more siltstone. It is often difficult to spot the contact between the Windgate and Kayenta due to their similar color and grain size. One place where the contact is easiest to discern is west of State Route 24 along the Fremont River at mile marker 82.

A massive Sahara-like desert geologists call an erg then invaded the area, covering it with 800 to 1,100 feet (240 to 335 m) of accumulated white to tan-colored fossilized sand dunes. The resulting formation, called the Navajo Sandstone, is composed of cross-bedded and very clean sandstone with well-rounded, generally very fine-grained and frosted sand. It reached its greatest thickness, 2,000 feet (610 m) in what is now Zion National Park (see geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area). The cross-bedded make-up of the Navajo leads to the formation of curvilinear canyons and rounded domes such as Capitol Dome and Navajo Dome. In other places it forms massive cliffs and monoliths. Subsequent erosion leveled the tops of the sand dunes and left them in up to 60 foot (18 m) thick easy to discern layers.
===San Rafael Group (Jurassic)===

Frequent but short-lived changes in sea level during the Mid to Late Jurassic periodically flooded the area with shallow extensions of the ocean. The resulting San Rafael Group is composed of four formations that were deposited on top of the Glen Canyon Group&#x27;s regionally traceable erosion surface. San Rafael Group formations are (from oldest to youngest);
*Page Sandstone,
*Carmel Formation,
*Entrada Sandstone,
*Curtis Formation, and
*Summerville Formation.
San Rafael formations can be seen on the east-dipping part of the Waterpocket Fold.

Climatic conditions were still arid when the locally 0 to 100 feet (0 to 30 m) thick Page Sandstone was deposited above the reach of high tide yet near the shore of an advancing sea (sabkha-like conditions). This formation is composed of three members; the
*Harris Wash,
*Judd Hollow, and the
*Thousand Pockets.
Together they were laid on top of the Navajo sand dunes as the sea slowly flooded the vast desert. An outcrop of the Judd Hollow Member can be seen from mile marker 86.5 as a red cliff above the Fremont River falls. The cross-bedded sandstone just above the red cliff is an example of the Thousand Pockets Member.
In Mid Jurassic time gypsum, sand, and limey silt were deposited in what may have been a graben that was periodically covered by sea water and thus a place where repeated flooding was followed by evaporation. The resulting Carmel Formation is composed of 200 to 1,000 feet (60 to 300 m) of reddish-brown siltstone, mudstone and sandstone that alternates with whitish-gray gypsum and fossil-rich limestone in a banded pattern. Fossils include marine bivalves and ammonites. Most of the Carmel has been removed from the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s crest but outcrops can be seen capping the Golden Throne and atop various domes in the area. It can also be seen as reddish-brown triangular-shaped spurs called &#x27;flatirons&#x27; that form the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s eastern rampart.

A near-shore environment dominated by barrier islands, sand bars and tidal flats later returned to the region. The sand and silt deposited created the 400 to 900 foot (120 to 275 m) thick reddish orange Entrada Sandstone. Distinctive jointing systems in the Entrada lead to the formation of cathedrals and monoliths in Capitol Reef&#x27;s Cathedral Valley, arches in Arches National Park and &#x27;goblins&#x27; (the local name for hoodoos) in nearby Goblin Valley State Park. Entrada exposures in the southern part of the park are mostly made of flat-bedded siltstones and erode into slopes. Moving north, Entrada exposures increasingly become rich in cross-bedded sandstone and erode into cliffs with fewer and fewer slopes.

Fine-grained sand and silt mixed with sandy lime were laid down as sediments on top of the Entrada Sandstone, forming the locally 0 to 175 foot (53 m) thick erosion-resistant Curtis Formation. A green iron potassium silicate called glauconite in the Curtis indicates it was deposited in a shallow sea. Outcrops of the light grayish-green Curtis can be seen as a capstone in the northern section of the park while it is locally absent in the southern part.

Tidal flat conditions returned as the shallow sea that created the Curtis Formation retreated from land. Thin beds of reddish-brown mudstone alternating with less frequent beds of greenish-gray sandstone and limestone were deposited as sediments, forming the locally 50 to 250 foot (15 to 75 m) thick Summerville Formation. This formation erodes into ledgy cliffs and slopes and can be seen above Curtis caprock in Cathedral Valley. Fossilized mudcracks and ripple marks are found in the Curtis along with up to 28 foot (8.5 m) thick gypsum-rich beds.

===Morrison Formation (Jurassic)===
Again above sea level, streams laid down mud and sand in their channels, on lakebeds, and in swampy plains during the Upper Jurassic. This became the Morrison Formation, which is locally divided into three members (from oldest to youngest);
*Tidwell Member,
*Salt Wash, and
*Brushy Basin.

The 50 to 100 foot (15 to 30 m) thick Tidwell Member is locally difficult to recognize and therefore may or may not be in the area&#x27;s rocks. Easier to identify and study outcrops elsewhere in southeastern Utah indicate they were deposited in hypersaline lagoons.

Clay, mud, silt, cross-bedded sand, and pebbles were later deposited by meandering streams and in flood plains, forming the locally 100 to 500 foot (30 to 150 m) thick Salt Wash Member. Claystone and mudstone beds of this member erode into gray slopes that can exhibit brown, red, yellow, and green colors. Salt Wash sandstone is moderately sorted and fine to medium grained while pebble conglomerate beds are made of chert with small amounts of silica-rich limestone. Both bed types erode into ledges and small cliffs. The Salt Wash was locally mined in the 1950s to extract uranium ore.

The 200 to 350 foot (60 to 105 m) thick Brushy Basin Member is composed of claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with small amounts of conglomerate and sandstone. Clays in this member are rich in smectite and thus tend to swell when wet and dry to a crumbled surface that looks a bit like popcorn. Fossilized dinosaur bones are abundant in this member in several places located in Utah and western Colorado. The bones are usually scattered and are thus hard to identify but nearly complete skeletons have been found in lake floor and flood-plain clays. Good exposures of the Brushy Basin Member can be seen in the Bentonite Hills.

===Cedar Mountain and Dakota formations (Cretaceous)===
Early Cretaceous time brought continental deposition that was dominated by rivers to the area. Sandstones and mudstones accumulated to form the 0 to 166 foot (50.5 m) thick slope-forming Cedar Mountain Formation. The 73 foot (22 m) thick Buckhorn Conglomerate Member thins out north and east of the park and is nearly absent in it, making it difficult to distinguish the underlying Morrison from the somewhat more pastel-colored Cedar Mountain. Fossilized freshwater animals such as mollusks and ostracods along with dinosaurs, fish scales, pollen and a genus of fern called &quot;Tempskya&quot; have been found in this formation.

The passive continental margin became active when the Farallon Plate started to dive below the North American Plate. Geologists call the resulting mountain-building event the Sevier orogeny. Compressive forces detached sedimentary units across western Utah and Nevada from their Precambrian basement rocks and pushed them eastward. The weight of the resulting high mountain range that formed to the west, lowered much of Utah and allowed the sea to invade. This grew into a vast sea that periodically divided North America in the Cretaceous called the Western Interior Seaway.

Non-marine sediments of the approximately 100- to 94-million-year-old Dakota Sandstone were deposited on the shore of this seaway early in the Cretaceous. The up to 150 foot (45 m) thick formation consists of fine-grained tan to brownish-gray colored quartz-rich sandstone that is interbedded with thin layers of carbon-rich shale, coal, and conglomerate.

Petrified wood is found in the lower part of the formation while fossilized marine bivalves such as &quot;Corbula&quot; and &quot;Pycnodonte newberryi&quot; are in the upper layers. This fossil progression shows a record of flooding that created the seaway. Dakota erode into small cliffs and hogbacks that can be seen in the southern section of the park.

===Mancos Shale and Mesaverde Formation (Cretaceous)===
Approximately 94 to 85 million years ago, the seaway advanced onto and retreated from land as it laid down the Mancos Shale. The Mancos is composed mostly of shale but two of its members, the Ferron and Muley Canyon, are sandstone that were laid down when relative sea level temporarily dropped. The five Mancos members from oldest to youngest are:
#Tununk Shale,
#Ferron Sandstone,
#Blue Gate Shale,
#Muley Canyon, and
#Masuk.

Parts of this formation are found in some mesas and buttes in the southernmost part of the park and in badlands east of the park.

Open marine conditions created the locally 40 to 720 feet (12 to 220 m) thick gullied slope-forming Tununk Shale Member. It is made of bluish-gray shale with interbedded mudstone, fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. The Tununk erodes into a slope and is locally fossil-rich. It is most prominently exposed in the Blue Desert immediately southeast of Cathedral Valley and contains fossilized examples of cephalopods, bivalves, and fish scales.

A wave-dominated delta and river system then spread over the area, creating the locally 205 to 385 feet (62 to 117 m) thick cliff-forming Ferron Sandstone. It is composed of brown fine-grained sandstone along with white cross-bedded sandstone with interbedded carbonate-rich gray shale. The marine bivalve &quot;Inoceramus&quot; and trace fossils of &quot;Ophiomorpha&quot; are found in the lower part of this member. Ferron Sandstone north of the area contains seams of coal in its upper part, prompting some petroleum geologists to study this member to model oil-bearing regions.
Open marine conditions returned in the Late Cretaceous, forming the locally 1,200 to 1,500 foot (365 to 460 m) thick slope-forming Blue Gate Shale. This member is composed of bentonite rich clays, siltstone and some sandstone. It erodes into gullied slopes similar in appearance to the Tununk Shale. The presence of two species of planktonic foraminifera in the upper Blue Gate, &quot;Clioscaphites vermiformis&quot; and &quot;Clioscaphites choteauenis&quot;, was used to date this member.

An ancient shoreline once again approached the area, resulting in the formation of the locally 300 to 400 feet (90 to 120 m) thick Muley Canyon Member. It is composed of evenly bedded, fine-grained sandstone and carbon-rich shales. Coal beds are found in the upper parts of this member, indicating continental coastal plain conditions at that time.

Alternating layers of shallow marine and non-marine sediments were deposited as the shoreline fluctuated back and forth over the area. These sediments became the locally 650 to 750 foot (200 to 230 m) thick Masuk Member. The Masuk consists of cliff-forming cross-bedded sandstones and slope-forming yellowish-gray to bluish-gray mudstones with interbedded light gray sandstones. Fossils of bivalves, ceratopsian dinosaurs, crocodiles, gastropods, and turtles have been collected in this member.

The Western Interior Seaway was shrinking due to infilling and uplift while the high mountains to the east were being reduced by erosion. Barrier beaches and river deltas migrated eastward into the seaway. The resulting 300 to 400 foot (90 to 120 m) thick Mesaverde Formation consists of light-brown to dark-gray thick-bedded and cross-stratified sandstone with interbedded dark gray shale and intertongues with the Masuk Member of the overlying Mancos Shale. Only small remnants are found capping a few mesas in the park&#x27;s eastern section.

==Uplift and Cenozoic events==

===Waterpocket Fold, Lake Uinta and volcanism===
The Laramide orogeny compacted the region from about 70 million to 50 million years ago and in the process created the Rocky Mountains. Many monoclines (a type of gentle upward fold in rock strata) were also formed by the deep compressive forces of the Laramide. One of those monoclines, called the Waterpocket Fold, is the major geographic feature of the park. The 100 mile (160 km) long fold has a north–south alignment with a steeply east-dipping side. The rock layers on the west side of the Waterpocket Fold have been lifted more than 7,000 feet (2,100 m) higher than the layers on the east. Thus older rocks are exposed on the western part of the fold and younger rocks on the eastern part. This particular fold may have been created due to movement along a fault in the Precambrian basement rocks hidden well below any exposed formations. Small earthquakes centered below the fold in 1979 may be from such a fault.

Contemporary with the Waterpocket Fold&#x27;s formation was the development of an intermontane (between mountains) basin in the area. Lake Uinta filled this basin with stream water derived from the north and south. This large lake existed from about 58 million until 35 million years ago and is responsible for creating the Flagstaff Limestone and Green River Formation, which locally reach a thickness of around 200 feet (60 m). Elsewhere these formations have a combined thickness of over 9,000 feet (2,740 m). The Flagstaff is a white-colored, fossil rich layer that is composed of limestone, tufa and conglomerate that erodes into ledges and slopes.

Compressive forces caused by the Laramide orogeny were followed by some minor stretching as a new equilibrium was established. This created weaknesses in the crust that allowed magma to intrude toward the surface to create composite volcanos west of the area some 25 to 20 million years ago. Within the fold, magma intruded through and between formations about 4.6 to 3.7 million years ago to respectively create dikes and sills. Small basaltic lava flows erupted through fissures at the surface and igneous activity continued sporadically afterwards. Subsequent erosion preferentially removed the softer sedimentary rock that initially entombed the dikes, sills, and volcanic plugs, often leaving them standing in relief. Examples can be seen in South Desert and Cathedral Valley at the northern end of the fold.

===Erosion===
Ten to fifteen million years ago the entire region was uplifted several thousand feet (well over a kilometer) by the creation of the Colorado Plateaus. This time the uplift was more even, leaving the overall orientation of the formations mostly intact. Most of the erosion that carved today&#x27;s landscape occurred after the uplifting of the Colorado Plateau with much of the major canyon cutting probably occurring between 1 and 6 million years ago. Even in this desert climate, water is the erosional agent most responsible for the carving of the landscape. The pull of gravity, in the form of rock falls or rock creep, plays a major role in the shaping of the cliff lines. Wind is a minor agent of erosion here.

The drainage system in the area was rearranged and steepened as the Waterpocket Fold was uplifted. Larger streams, such as the Fremont River, were more likely to keep up with the uplift by downcutting into the Waterpocket Fold faster. Other streams, such as Sand Creek, changed their course by flowing parallel to the fold and cutting into less resistant formations. Yet other streams tried to keep up with the uplift by carving slot canyons only to later change course, leaving their canyons literally high and dry. A total of 7,000 feet (2,100 m) of overlying Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment has been removed by erosion in the area.
Wetter and cooler conditions developed during the Pleistocene epoch and briefly returned via at least two neoglacial episodes (little ice ages) in the current epoch, the Holocene. The various rivers and streams in the area were engorged by increased precipitation and with melt-water from mountain glaciers on the Henry Mountains to the east and the Aquarius Plateau to the west of the park. Flash floods, mass wasting of hillsides, frost wedging, and landslides all contributed to a significantly faster rate of erosion. Glaciers plucked 20- to 30-million-year-old black basaltic boulders from atop Boulder and Thousand Lake Mountains that were subsequently deposited over the park area by meltwater streams from the glaciers, rockslides and floods.

<text>In electronics, a pinout (sometimes written &quot;pin-out&quot;) is a cross-reference between the contacts, or &quot;pins&quot;, of an electrical connector or electronic component, and their functions. &quot;Pinout&quot; now supersedes the term &quot;basing diagram&quot; which was the standard terminology used by the manufacturers of vacuum tubes and the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). The RMA started its standardization in 1934, collecting and correlating tube data for registration at what was to become the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) which now has many sectors reporting to it and sets what is known as EIA standards where all registered pinouts and registered jacks can be found.

== Purpose ==
The functions of contacts in electrical connectors, be they power- or signaling-related, must be specified for connectors to be interchangeable. Each connector contact must mate with the contact on the other connector with the same function. If contacts of disparate functions are allowed to make contact, the connection may fail, and damage may result. Therefore, pinouts are a vital reference when building and testing connectors, cables, and adapters.

Suppose one has specified wires within a cable (for instance, the colored Ethernet cable wires in ANSI/TIA-568 T568A). In that case, the order in which different color wires are attached to pins of an electrical connector defines the wiring scheme. In any multi-pin connector, there are multiple ways to map wires to pins, so different configurations may be created that superficially look identical but function differently. Pinouts define these configurations. Many connectors have multiple standard pinouts in use for different manufacturers or applications.

== Terminology ==
While one usage of the word &quot;pin&quot; is to refer to electrical contacts of, specifically, the male gender, its usage in &quot;pinout&quot; does not imply gender: the contact-to-function cross-reference for a connector that has only female socket contacts is still called a &quot;pinout&quot;.

== Representation ==
The pinout can typically be shown as a table or diagram. However, it is necessary to clarify how to view the diagram, stating if it shows the backside of the connector (where wires are attached) or the &quot;mating face&quot; of the connector. Published pinouts, which are particularly important when different manufacturers want to interconnect their products using open standards, are typically provided by the connector or equipment manufacturer. However, some pinouts are provided by 3rd parties since the manufacturer does not well document some connectors.

While repairing electronic devices, an electronics technician uses electronic test equipment to &quot;pin out&quot; each component on a PCB. The technician probes each pin of the component in turn, comparing the expected signal on each pin to the actual signal on that pin.

<text>Rice–Eccles Stadium is an outdoor college football stadium located on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is the home field of the Utah Utes of the Big 12 Conference. It was built to serve as the stadium for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of 2002 Winter Olympics, a role it is expected to reprise for the 2034 Winter Olympics.

The FieldTurf playing field runs in the traditional north-south configuration at an elevation of above sea level, above downtown Salt Lake City.

== History ==
When Salt Lake City was awarded the 2002 Winter Olympics in June 1995, it was obvious that Rice Stadium, the largest outdoor stadium in Salt Lake City, was not suitable to serve as the main stadium. The concrete, timber, and earth-fill facility was built in 1927 and had not aged well. In 1996, U of U athletic director Chris Hill announced plans to renovate Rice Stadium into a new facility that would be up to Olympic standards. It was initially expected to take three years to completely overhaul the facility.

However, in 1997, Spencer Eccles, a Utah alumnus and chairman of Utah&#x27;s biggest bank, First Security Corporation (now part of Wells Fargo), announced that the George S. and Dolores Dore Eccles Foundation would donate $10 million toward the project. In recognition of this gift, the university received permission from the Eccles family to add George Eccles&#x27;s name to the stadium alongside that of Robert L. Rice, who had funded the original renovation project to Rice Stadium Before 1972, it was which opened in 1927 with a Utah win over Colorado Mines.

=== Renovations ===
Immediately after the 1997 season&#x27;s final home game on November 15, fittingly a 31–14 victory over Rice, Rice Stadium was almost completely demolished, replaced with a modern steel, concrete and glass facility. All that remained of the old stadium were the stands in the south end zone, built in 1982. The stadium did not miss a football season, as the project was timed not to disrupt the 1997 home schedule. The new stadium was ready less than 10 months later for the 1998 home opener, a 45–22 win over Louisville on September 12. The stadium then seated 45,017, plus a new six-story press box.
In 2014, a row of bleachers were been added in the standing room areas on the east, west and north sections of Rice–Eccles Stadium. 40 ADA seats were also added for a total of 790 new seats, increasing the capacity of Rice–Eccles Stadium to 45,807, plus additional space for standing room behind the new row of bleachers.

In June 2010, the U of U accepted an invitation to join the Pacific-10 Conference (which changed its name to the Pac-12 Conference shortly after the Utah Utes and the Colorado Buffaloes joined) and began playing in the conference during 2011–2012 season. It is expected that Rice–Eccles Stadium is to be expanded and the locker room facilities upgraded. This claim was furthered when both KSL.com and the &quot;Deseret News&quot; reported that the university was seriously considering expanding the stadium by at least 10,000 seats, which brings the expected capacity to 51,444.

In 2019, the University announced a renovation of the seating at the south end zone. The announced renovation was planned to add 6,000 more seats, high-end suites, locker rooms, offices, terrace seating, and a restaurant, all for $80 million. The Ken Garff Family donated $17.5 million and the section was named the &quot;Ken Garff Red Zone&quot; in his honor. Construction on the South End Zone was completed on August 12, 2021 and opened to the public that season. After construction, the stadium&#x27;s capacity had increased by 5,637 seats.

The Ken Garff Red Zone features new home and visiting locker rooms, sports medicine facilities and hospitality areas, the University Club restaurant, Diglisic Lounge, Layton Field Club, and various premium seating options, including suites, loge boxes, ledge, club, and premium terrace seating as well as additional bleacher seating. Utah’s new locker room is 5,300 square feet with 90 lockers. It features a one-of-a-kind locker design with hidden storage, wireless charging, and a locking box for athletes.

== Features ==
=== Olympic Cauldron Park ===

Immediately south of the stadium was the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park, which contained a 2002 Winter Olympic museum, the Olympic cauldron, and other memorabilia from the games. Only the cauldron remains at the stadium today; the museum and other memorabilia have all since been removed. Hoberman Arch was located until its removal in October 2014. The cauldron has undergone refurbishment and was relocated to a new Olympic plaza at the Southwest corner outside the stadium, just west of the South Endzone expansion.

=== Playing surface ===
Since 2002, the playing field at Rice–Eccles Stadium has been FieldTurf. It was most recently replaced in 2015.

When the stadium reopened in 1998, its surface was SportGrass, a hybrid of natural grass and artificial turf. Earlier, Rice Stadium had been among the first facilities to use SportGrass. A full natural grass was installed in 2000 for two seasons, then was covered by asphalt blacktop for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics.

It was the second-highest field in the Pac-12, about lower than Colorado&#x27;s Folsom Field in Boulder, and over above the third-highest, Washington State&#x27;s Martin Stadium in Pullman. After moving to the Big 12 Conference in 2024, Colorado and Utah again have the two highest fields in the conference.

== Events ==
=== 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===

During the 2002 Winter Olympics, the stadium served as the venue for the Opening Ceremony on February 8, 2002, and for the Closing Ceremony on February 24, 2002. To host the ceremonies, the grass field was paved over with asphalt and a stage was constructed, scoreboards were removed, flags and Olympic livery were installed, temporary seating was brought in (allowing more than 50,000 spectators), and the 2002 Olympic cauldron was installed atop the southern bleachers.

For the duration of the games, the stadium was temporarily renamed the &quot;Rice–Eccles Olympic Stadium&quot;. Through broadcasts from the stadium, an estimated 3.5 billion people worldwide watched the Opening and Closing Ceremonies on television.

The Opening Ceremony of the 2002 Winter Paralympics was also held in the stadium on March 7, 2002. The corresponding Closing Ceremony followed suit on March 16, 2002.

=== 2034 Winter Olympics and Paralympics ===
During the 2034 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, the stadium is expected to serve as the venue for the Opening and Closing ceremonies.

=== Concerts ===
=== Real Salt Lake ===
Rice–Eccles Stadium was also the home field of the Major League Soccer franchise Real Salt Lake from 2005 until October 2008, when Rio Tinto Stadium was opened in the suburb of Sandy, south of Salt Lake City.

=== Utah Utes ===
Rice–Eccles Stadium replaced Rice Stadium, the former home field of the Utah Utes football team. The first Utes game at the stadium was a 45–22 victory over the Louisville Cardinals held on September 12, 1998, with 44,112 in attendance. The Utes have a 120-37 (.764) record at the stadium through the 2023 season.

=== Salt Lake Stallions ===
The Salt Lake Stallions of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) played at Rice–Eccles Stadium during the league&#x27;s lone season in 2019.

=== Other events ===
The stadium hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship from 2001 to 2004, 2009 to 2013 and 2017. In 2020, it hosted the final seven rounds of the series in a “COVID-19 bubble” with no fans being allowed in the stands. Since 2021, Rice–Eccles Stadium has been the home of the Championship round of the series.

Rice–Eccles Stadium hosted its first Monster Jam event in 2022. The series then stopped by every year the week before the Monster Energy Supercross championship took place in the same stadium. In May 2024 it was announced that the stadium would host Monster Jam World Finals 24 in 2025.

<text>Rudolph Tomjanovich Jr. (born November 24, 1948) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. He won two NBA Championships with the Houston Rockets (1994, 1995) and coached Team USA to the gold medal in men&#x27;s basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

His professional playing career, which lasted between 1970 and 1981, was entirely spent with the San Diego / Houston Rockets. Tomjanovich was a 5-time NBA All-Star forward; four consecutive times between 1974 and 1977, and again in 1979. He also made the playoffs five times: in 1975, 1977, and consecutively between 1979 and 1981.

On December 9, 1977, during a game between the Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers, Tomjanovich was the victim of a life-threatening punch to his face brought upon him by Lakers power forward Kermit Washington. This ended his season after 23 games; after fully recovering, Tomjanovich played in the NBA for three more seasons.

After about eight years of being an assistant coach, Tomjanovich served as head coach of the Rockets from 1992 to 2003. As head coach, he led the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships, in 1994 and 1995. He also coached the Los Angeles Lakers during part of the 2004–05 NBA season. He was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame on May 16, 2021. In 2024, he will be included in Croatian American Sports Hall of Fame.

He was a consultant for the Los Angeles Lakers for 14 years.

==Early life==
Tomjanovich was born in Hamtramck, Michigan, the son of Catherine (Modich) and Rudolph Tomjanovich Sr. He is of Croatian descent. He attended high school in Hamtramck and later the University of Michigan (1967–1970). He was a high school teammate of ABA player John Brisker.

==Playing career==

===College career (1967–1970)===

In college, Tomjanovich set Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball career rebounding records that continue to stand. In 1968 he earned second team All-Big Ten honors, which he followed with first-team honors in 1969 and 1970. During 1970 he was also an All-American.

===San Diego / Houston Rockets (1970–1981)===
Tomjanovich was selected in the 1970 NBA draft as the second overall pick by the San Diego Rockets (the franchise relocated to Houston in 1971), for whom he would play the entirety of his NBA career. He was also drafted in both 1970 and 1974 by the Utah Stars of the ABA. In his eleven years in the NBA, Tomjanovich had a scoring average of 17.4 points and a rebounding average of 8.1, earning five All-Star Game selections in the process (1974–1977, 1979). He is the fourth-leading scorer in Rockets history behind James Harden and Hall of Famers Calvin Murphy and Hakeem Olajuwon. Because his last name was so long, the back of Tomjanovich&#x27;s jerseys would read &quot;RUDY T.&quot;, rather than his 11 character name.

The Rockets retired Tomjanovich&#x27;s #45 jersey upon the conclusion of his playing career. His collegiate jersey, also #45, was retired by the University of Michigan in 2003.

====Kermit Washington incident====
During a game on December 9, 1977, Tomjanovich was punched by Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers as Tomjanovich ran to stop a fight at center court. The blow shattered Tomjanovich&#x27;s face and inflicted life-threatening head and spinal injuries, leaving him sidelined for five months. He eventually made a full recovery and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game the following 1978–79 season. The incident and its aftermath are recounted in the John Feinstein book &quot;The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever&quot;, as well as in Tomjanovich&#x27;s 1997 autobiography &quot;A Rocket at Heart: My Life and My Team&quot;.

==Coaching career==
===Coaching style===
Tomjanovich was well known for his instinctive managerial style and intensity on the bench. Always self-deprecating, he nonetheless heaped tremendous pressure on himself and his assistants to be prepared for each game, several times being hospitalized for exhaustion. After winning back-to-back titles, Tomjanovich deflected much of the praise and eschewed the &quot;genius&quot; label assigned to other champion coaches like Chuck Daly and Phil Jackson. His hands-off, easy-going manner with his players gave him a reputation as a &quot;players coach&quot;, and as such veteran players were eager to play on his teams. Among the stars who requested and were granted trades to Houston during his tenure were Clyde Drexler, Charles Barkley, and Scottie Pippen.

===U.S. Men&#x27;s national team===
In 1998, Tomjanovich volunteered to coach the U.S. men&#x27;s senior basketball team at the FIBA World Championship in Greece. Despite the absence of NBA players due to contract negotiations, Tomjanovich guided the hastily assembled group of players playing in Europe, CBA and college players to the bronze medal. In light of his outstanding service in coaching at the 1998 Worlds and his stellar professional resume, Tomjanovich was tabbed to coach the U.S. men&#x27;s senior team at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. Team won the gold medal with an 8–0 record. On February 15, 2006, Tomjanovich was named director of scouting for USA Men&#x27;s Basketball.

===NBA===

==== Houston Rockets (1992–2003) ====
Tomjanovich retired in 1981 and became a scout for two years before being named an assistant coach in 1983. He served as an assistant under Bill Fitch and Don Chaney.

Tomjanovich was named the Rockets&#x27; interim head coach in February 1992 after Chaney&#x27;s resignation. After nearly leading the Rockets to a playoff berth, he was then given the job on a permanent basis.

In his first full season on the job (1992–93), Tomjanovich guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title, making him the first head coach to ever take his team from the lottery to a division crown during his first full season. Building on this success, Tomjanovich led the team to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995; additionally, the Rockets were the only team other than the Chicago Bulls to win multiple championships during the 1990s, with their titles being bookended by the Bulls&#x27; two runs of three consecutive titles each. On the playoff run to their second title, the Rockets became the lowest seed (sixth) to win one, and the only team in history to defeat the teams with the four best regular-season records in the playoffs. It was on the floor of The Summit after they captured their second title that Tomjanovich proclaimed, &quot;Don&#x27;t ever underestimate the heart of a champion!&quot;

In his 11-plus season tenure as Rockets head coach, he posted a 503–397 (.559) regular-season record and a 51–39 (.567) playoff mark. His career wins and winning percentage are Rockets franchise records. After the 1998–99 season, the Rockets would not make the playoffs for the rest of his coaching tenure, and would consistently finish in the division cellar; Tomjanovich left the team after the 2002–03 season when he was diagnosed with bladder cancer (from which he has since made a full recovery), ending a 33-year association with the Rockets franchise—including its first 32 years in Houston—as a player, assistant coach and head coach.

==== Los Angeles Lakers (2004–2005) ====
In 2004, Tomjanovich signed a five-year, $30 million contract to replace Phil Jackson as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He resigned after 43 games, citing mental and physical exhaustion unrelated to his past bout with bladder cancer. The Lakers paid him a $10 million settlement, leading to speculation that the Lakers had instead terminated his contract. Tomjanovich stayed with the Lakers as a consultant.

==Personal life==
Tomjanovich has two daughters and one son with his ex-wife Sophie. He resides in Houston, Texas, with his longtime girlfriend, Lisa Marcussen.

Tomjanovich has participated with the Texas Children&#x27;s Cancer Center to help raise funds for cancer research.

He had a scholarship program with the Tomjanovich foundation, that helped put 100s of students in college.

Tomjanovich is an avid supporter for the Houston Rockets, Houston Texans, Houston Astros, University of Houston, University of Michigan and Naismith Hall of Fame.

<text>The 2003 Canberra bushfires caused severe damage to the suburbs and outer areas of Canberra, the capital city of Australia, during 18–22 January 2003. Almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s (ACT) pastures, pine plantations, and nature parks were severely damaged, and most of the Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. After burning for a week around the edges of the ACT, the fires entered the suburbs of Canberra on 18 January 2003. Over the next ten hours, four people died, over 490 were injured, and 470 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, requiring a significant relief and reconstruction effort.

== Buildup to the event ==
On 8 January 2003, lightning strikes started four fires in New South Wales, over the border but in close proximity to Canberra. Despite their proximity and very small initial sizes, low intensity, and low rate of spread, these fires were not extinguished or contained by New South Wales emergency services personnel. Subsequent inquiries into the bushfires, including the Roche report, the McLeod inquiry, and the Coroners Report, identified poor management of the initial response as a key contributor to the disaster that unfolded on 18 January 2003.

On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter that had been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading water buckets from the dam at the time of the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of life vest, was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.

Both Stanhope and Lucas-Smith received the Royal Life Saving Society&#x27;s rescue medal to commemorate their bravery in the rescue. McKenzie received the society&#x27;s highest award, the Bravery Cross, which recognises undertaking a rescue in an aquatic environment under circumstances that endanger the rescuer&#x27;s life.

On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) released its final media release prior to 18 January, at 8:50 pm. This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several clues that were overlooked in the assessment of the risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra), signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself.

==Events of 18 January==


The morning of Saturday 18 January 2003 was hot, windy and dry. Temperatures as high as and winds exceeding , plus a very low relative humidity, were the main weather features of the day. Two fires continued to burn out of control in the Namadgi National Park, with the entire park, along with the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, being closed due to the threat. A second fire, in the Brindabella Ranges, was threatening to break containment lines.

By 9 am on the morning of Saturday 18 January, burned leaves appeared on lawns in houses in the Weston Creek, Kambah, and Tuggeranong suburbs bordering the western extremity of Canberra. By 10 am, news helicopters were overflying Duffy and reporting news of the fires interstate and internationally.

Throughout the day, the fires burned closer to the fringes of Canberra&#x27;s suburbs, and there was no sign of authorities gaining control of the situation. At around 2 pm, police evacuated the township of Tharwa to the south of Canberra.

By mid-afternoon, it had become apparent that the fires posed an immediate threat to the settlements near Canberra, such as Uriarra and Stromlo, as well as to the houses on the city&#x27;s urban-bushland interface. A state of emergency was declared at 2.45 pm by the ACT&#x27;s Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope.

The fires reached the urban area at 3 pm. The first emergency warning advisories were broadcast shortly after, on radio and television, with the advisories updated throughout the day. These advisories, accompanied by the Emergency Warning Signal stated that a significant &quot;deterioration&quot; of the fire situation in the ACT had occurred and placed several suburbs on alert to evacuate. As the day continued, these advisories advised the evacuation of several suburbs (also enforced by Police on the ground) and placed most suburbs of Canberra on some level of alert. By now, the fire had reached the fringes of many suburbs, was surrounding Tharwa, and threatened the historic Lanyon Homestead, which was hosting a wedding and protected by only a single fire truck.

By 3.50 pm, some houses were alight in the suburbs of Duffy and Chapman, with the loss of a home in Holder soon after. An ACT Fire Brigade unit, perceiving the fire from a vantage point in Fyshwick, overrode instructions by the radio controller to ignore the signs and remain where they were. The unit headed to Duffy, attempting to alert both controllers and residents to the imminent danger. That unit was caught in a fire front on Warragamba Avenue Duffy at around 4.10 pm, after having rescued at least two residents. Both the crew and residents were forced to flee the appliance when the fire struck.

Due to fire damage to infrastructure and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, large parts of the city lost power. Fires also started in Giralang because of powerline problems. Evacuation centres were set up at four schools – Canberra College, UC Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra (then Lake Ginninderra College), Erindale College, and Narrabundah College. A dark cloud hung over the city, and, although it was not in danger, Parliament House was closed.

By 5 pm, houses were reported destroyed in Duffy, Chapman, Kambah, Holder, and Rivett, as well as in the small forestry settlement of Uriarra. It was later found that the first casualty of the fires, an elderly woman named Dorothy McGrath, had died at the nearby Stromlo Forestry Settlement. Escape for residents was hampered by poor warning and by the settlement&#x27;s location, surrounded by the pine forest. Fires in the Michelago area forced the closure of the Monaro Highway into Canberra. Fires spread through the Kambah Pool area and into the suburb of Kambah, causing damage to many homes and one of the ACT&#x27;s primary Urban and Rural fire stations.

Fire spread through parkland, crossing the Tuggeranong Parkway and Sulwood Drive finally engulfing Mount Taylor. Within an hour, houses were also burning in Torrens, on the slopes of Mount Taylor, and in Weston. The fires by now had inflicted severe damage to the city&#x27;s infrastructure. Power supplies were cut to several suburbs. These outages affected both the Emergency Services Bureau&#x27;s own headquarters in Curtin and the Canberra Hospital (running on back-up generators), which was under intense pressure from people suffering burns and smoke inhalation. In Curtin, the ESA headquarters was in danger from the fires. With back-up power available only to the Communications Centre, many personnel were forced to work on tables outside as Army Reserve personnel hosed down the building. It was later noted that the ESB could have moved its operations away from danger to other emergency service locations such as the AFP Winchester Centre or Tuggeranong Police Station. Water, gas, sewerage, and communications were heavily affected. Water, gas, and landline communications was unavailable to several suburbs due to damage to supply lines and city reservoirs. Mobile telecommunications were severely affected due to increased traffic, causing serious disruption to mobile phone networks and the ESA&#x27;s own radio and dispatch networks. A local generator services business later reported on their website that the ash and smoke were so intense, that some back-up power diesel generators at communication and data centres failed to produce enough power due to air intake filters clogging up. At least one generator air intake filter burned as it sucked in burning leaves blowing in the strong winds.

The fires impacted part of the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre (LMWQCC), responsible for treating the city&#x27;s sewage and waste water before its release into the Molonglo River. The plant&#x27;s operations were disrupted due to fire damage, causing concern about the possible release of sewage into the Molonglo River, as the plant&#x27;s reserve storage could only hold one day of surplus. However, the lack of resources and equipment failures for crews protecting the plant could have led to a catastrophe, as detailed in Danny Camilleri&#x27;s testimony in Coroner Maria Doogan&#x27;s subsequent inquest into the fires. Camilleri testified that his crews arrived to find much of the area around the plant on fire, with a significant risk of the fire endangering dangerous substances stored at the plant to treat waste, including chlorine. He stated that if the fire had caused a breach in the chlorine tanks, it would have created &quot;a poisonous cloud that would blow toward Canberra necessitating mass evacuations&quot;.

By 10 pm, one of the four evacuation centres in Canberra was completely full, and the others were filling up quickly. Reports of looting also began to arrive from the damaged areas. Both Prime Minister John Howard and Governor General Peter Hollingworth changed their plans to return to Canberra as soon as was possible. While the very worst of the fires had passed, the situation was still far from stable, and going into Sunday, 19 January, houses were still ablaze across numerous suburbs.

=== Fire tornado ===
The first documented case of a fire tornado in Australia was during the 2003 Canberra bushfire. It was calculated to have horizontal winds of and vertical air speed of , spawned by its own wind rotation from a pyrocumulonimbus cloud and causing the flashover of in 0.04 seconds. It was also the first known fire tornado to have EF3 wind speeds on the Enhanced Fujita scale and the only known one until the 2018 Carr Fire in California.

==Aftermath==

By the evening of 19 January, it was clear that the worst-hit suburb was Duffy, where 200+ residences were destroyed, and that four people had died: Alison Tener, 38, Peter Brooke, 74, and Douglas Fraser, 60, and Dorothy McGrath, 76, of the Mount Stromlo Forestry Settlement. The loss of life, damage to property, and destruction of forests to the west of the city caused not just economic loss but significant social impacts. 
Bushfires severely harmed the vegetation of the Cotter River Catchment and caused water quality problems in the three dams in the catchment: Corin, Bendora and Cotter Dams. For quite some time after the fires, turbidity in the water due to silt and ash from surrounding burnt-out forests meant Canberra had to rely on Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River, which was not affected by the fires. Given the drought and existing water shortages, this effectively reduced Canberra&#x27;s water reserves to around 15% for some time. An upgrade to the Stromlo Water Treatment Plant was subsequently required to allow extra filtration of water to cope with the diminished quality in the future.

As with any bushfire, the environment will take significant time to regenerate. Regeneration of vegetation was delayed by an ongoing drought in the region.

===Mount Stromlo===

Perhaps the most notable cultural and scientific loss caused by the fires was the damage to the scenic and renowned Mount Stromlo Observatory (headquarters of the Research School of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics of the Australian National University), which is estimated to be the source of a third of Australia&#x27;s astronomical research. Five historically significant telescopes were destroyed. Instrumentation and engineering workshops, the observatory&#x27;s library, and the main administration buildings were consumed. The visitors&#x27; centre or &quot;Exploratory&quot; housing public exhibits and cafe escaped the fires unscathed, despite being on the edge of a steep gradient, which fires had roared up, and being only metres from the telescope, which was completely destroyed.

The insurance payment sought by the Australian National University (ANU), amounting to 75 million Australian dollars, could have become the largest insurance claim in Australian history. However, in August 2009, during trial in the ACT Supreme Court, the three insurance companies settled out of court, paying the ANU an undisclosed sum. A related claim against ANU&#x27;s insurance broker, Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd, for failing to renew insurance coverage on some structures, was also settled for an unstated amount in June 2011.

Canberra artist Tim Wetherell was commissioned by ANU to produce a sculpture from the ruins of the Mount Stromlo telescopes. The finished sculpture was named &quot;The Astronomer&quot; and installed in the Parliamentary Triangle outside Questacon. It represents the concept of stellar parallax.

==Official responses==
Following the 2003 bushfires, the ACT and New South Wales and Australian governments initiated community and official responses to the fire.

===Bushfire Recovery Taskforce===

The Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established to advise the ACT Government, provide leadership for the recovery, and act as a bridge between Government agencies and the community. It reported in October 2003.

===McLeod Inquiry===

The ACT Government established the McLeod Inquiry to examine and report on the
operational response to the bushfires. The Inquiry was headed by Ron McLeod, a former Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Inquiry handed down its findings on 1 August 2003.

The inquiry found that:
*The fires, started by lightning strikes, might have been contained, had they been attacked more aggressively in the 24 hours after they broke out. Large stretches of dry, drought-affected vegetation and weather conditions that were extremely conducive to fire meant that once the fires reached a certain size, they were very difficult to control.
*Management of fuel load in parks and adequate access to remote areas were both lacking.
*Emergency service personnel performed creditably, but they were overwhelmed by the intensity of the fires and the unexpected speed of their advance on 18 January.
*A comprehensive ACT Emergency Plan was in place at the time of the fire; it worked, particularly in recovery after the fires, in dealing with the large number of people who needed temporary shelter and assistance as a consequence of the fires.
*Inadequacies in the physical construction and layout of the Emergency Services Bureau centre in Curtin were a hindrance. The centre was unable to handle efficiently the large amount of data and communications traffic into and out of the centre at the height of the crisis.
*There were some equipment and resourcing deficiencies within the ACT&#x27;s emergency service organisations.
*Information and advice given to the community about the progress of the fires, the seriousness of the threat, and the preparations the public should be making was seriously inadequate. There was also confusion as to whether homes had to be evacuated.

The Inquiry recommended there should be increased emphasis given to controlled burning as a fuel-reduction strategy, access to and training of emergency personnel in remote areas needed to be improved and a number of changes be made to the emergency services and the policies that govern their operations, including a greater emphasis on provision of information to the public.

===ACT Coroner&#x27;s Bushfire Inquiry===

The Coroner&#x27;s inquiry commenced in January 2003, and hearing officially opened on 16 June 2003. The Coroner&#x27;s Court of the Australian Capital Territory conducted an inquiry into the cause, origin, and circumstances of the 2003 bushfires and inquests into the four deaths associated with those fires. The inquiry was under the provisions of the ACT &quot;Coroners Act 1997&quot;.

The inquiry was marked by controversy, and in February 2005 the ACT Supreme Court heard an application that the coroner be disqualified due to bias. The inquiry into the fires was on hold until August 2005, when the Full Bench of the Supreme Court delivered its decision, declaring that Coroner Maria Doogan should not be disqualified on the ground of a reasonable apprehension of bias. The inquiry reconvened on 17 August 2005.

After over 90 days of examining the evidence, the inquiry wrapped up on 25 October 2005. Although the inquiry was supposed to be completed in early 2006, submissions continued into mid-2006, with the Coroner delivering her findings, &quot;The Canberra Firestorm&quot;, in December 2006.

=== House Select Committee on the recent Australian bushfires ===

On 26 March 2003 the House of Representatives established a Select Committee to inquire into the Australian bushfires at that time, including the Canberra bushfire. The committee tabled the report of its inquiry on 5 November 2003 and the Australian government presented its response to the report on 15 September 2005.

== Bushfire memorial ==

On 18 January 2006, three years after the day of the bushfires, a bushfire memorial was opened on land which had been affected by the fires in Stromlo forest.

The ACT Bushfire Memorial was commissioned by the ACT government to acknowledge the impact of the fires and thank the many organisations and individuals who played crucial roles in the fire fighting and recovery efforts.

The memorial was designed by Canberra artists Tess Horwitz, Tony Steel and Martyn Jolly and incorporates elements requested by the ACT community. It is a journey from the day of the fire, through the process of recovery, to the honouring of memory.

The entrance memorial walls are made from the community&#x27;s salvaged bricks, which are inscribed with messages of grief and gratitude. Beyond the walls, a site framed by a grove of casuarinas contains red glass and metal forms, referring to the force of the firestorm and to the lightning strikes that sparked the main fires. An avenue leads to an amphitheatre enclosing a pond and bubbling spring. Glass columns bordering the pond contain details from photos provided by the community which speak of memory and human resilience.

On 18 February 2006, an independent group of fire victims installed a plaque to honour the four people who died in the fires and the volunteer firefighters who fought so hard. The plaque is located at the end of the walkway to the memorial, immediately before the memorial walls. Fire victims and residents held a simple ceremony to mark the occasion.
