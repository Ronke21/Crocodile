<text>, abbreviated as OU or , is a national research university in Osaka, Japan. The university traces its roots back to Edo-era institutions Tekijuku (1838) and Kaitokudo (1724), and was officially established in 1931 as the sixth of the Imperial Universities in Japan, with two faculties: science and medicine. Following the post-war educational reform, it merged with three pre-war higher schools, reorganizing as a comprehensive university with five faculties: science, medicine, letters, law and economics, and engineering. After the merger with Osaka University of Foreign Studies in 2007, Osaka University became the largest national university in Japan by undergraduate enrollment.

Osaka University is one of the most productive research institutions in Japan. Numerous prominent scholars and scientists have attended or worked at Osaka University, such as Nobel Laureate in Physics Hideki Yukawa, manga artist Osamu Tezuka, Lasker Award winner Hidesaburō Hanafusa, author Ryōtarō Shiba, and discoverer of regulatory T cells Shimon Sakaguchi.

==History==

The academic traditions of Osaka University reach back to the , an Edo-period school for local citizens founded in 1724, and the , a school of Rangaku for samurai founded by Ogata Kōan in 1838. The spirit of the university&#x27;s humanities programmes is believed to be intimately rooted in the history of the Kaitokudō, whereas that of the natural and applied sciences is based upon the traditions of the Tekijuku.
Osaka University traces its modern origins back the founding of Osaka Prefectural Medical School in downtown Osaka City in 1869. The school was later designated the Osaka Prefectural Medical College with university status by the University Ordinance (Imperial Ordinance No. 388) in 1919. The Medical College merged with the newly founded College of Science to form Osaka Imperial University in 1931. Osaka Imperial University was the sixth imperial university in Japan. Osaka Technical College was incorporated to form the School of Engineering two years later. The entire university was renamed Osaka University in 1947.

After merging with Naniwa High School and Osaka High School as a result of the government&#x27;s education system reform in 1949, Osaka University started its postwar era with five faculties: Science, Medicine, Engineering, Letters, and Law. Since that time new faculties and research institutes have been established, including the first Japanese School of Engineering Science and the School of Human Sciences which covers such cross-disciplinary research interests as broadly as psychology, sociology, and education. Built on the then-existing faculties, ten graduate schools were set up as part of the government&#x27;s education system reform program in 1953. Two more graduate faculties were added in 1994.

In 1993, Osaka University Hospital was relocated from the Nakanoshima campus in downtown Osaka to the Suita campus, completing the implementation of the university&#x27;s plan to integrate the scattered facilities into the Suita and Toyonaka campuses. In October 2007, a merger between Osaka University and the Osaka University of Foreign Studies in Minoh was completed. The merger made Osaka University one of two national universities in the country with a School of Foreign Studies, along with the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. The merger also made Osaka University the largest national university in Japan.

==Campus==


===Toyonaka campus===
The Toyonaka campus is home to faculties of Humanities, Law, Economics, Science, and Engineering Science. It is also the academic base for Graduate Schools of International Public Policy, Language and Culture, a portion of Information Science, and the Center for the Practice of Legal and Political Expertise. All undergraduates attend classes on the Toyonaka campus during their first year of enrollment. Sports activities are primarily concentrated on the Toyonaka campus, with the exception of tennis, which is located in Suita.

===Suita campus===
The Suita campus houses faculties of Human Sciences, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Engineering. It contains the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences and a portion of the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. The campus is also home to the Osaka University Hospital and the Nationwide Joint Institute of Cybermedia Center and Research Center for Nuclear Physics.

===Minoh campus===
The Minoh campus was incorporated following the merger with the Osaka University of Foreign Studies in October 2007. The Minoh campus is home to the School of Foreign Studies, the Research Institute for World Languages, and the Center for Japanese Language and Culture.

In addition to these three campuses, the former Nakanoshima campus, the university&#x27;s earliest campus located in downtown Osaka, served as the hub for the faculty of medicine until the transfer to the Suita campus was completed in 1993. In April 2004, the Nakanoshima campus became the university&#x27;s Nakanoshima Center, serving as a venue for information exchange, adult education classes, and activities involving academic as well as non-academic communities.

==Organization==
Osaka University consists of 11 undergraduate schools and 15 graduate schools. The undergraduate schools include Letters, Human Sciences, Foreign Studies, Law, Economics, Science, (Faculty of) Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Engineering, and Engineering Science. At postgraduate level, the schools cover a range of disciplines: Humanities, Human Sciences, Law and Politics, Economics, Science, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Engineering, Engineering Science, International Public Policy, Information Science and Technology, Frontier Biosciences, Law (Law School), and the United School of Child Development, which is a collaboration with Kanazawa University, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Chiba University, and the University of Fukui.

=== English-medium programs ===
Osaka University&#x27;s School of Human Sciences on the Suita Campus hosts an English-medium four-year undergraduate degree program. The program started in 2011 as a result of the national government&#x27;s G30 (Global 30) Project. Although the government ended the G30 Project in 2014 and replaced it with the Top Global University Project, the OU Human Sciences International Undergraduate Program continues. Areas of study include sociology, anthropology, philosophy, education, behavioral sciences, psychology, human development, and area studies. Focus is on the development of an interdisciplinary, international, and problem-solving orientation to research and education. The degree programme is based on international benchmarking standards, has competitive entry requirements and attracts students from all over the world. The current director of this programme is Beverley Yamamoto, who leads a UNESCO Chair in Global Health and Education.

Osaka University&#x27;s Graduate School of Humanities hosts another English-medium program in Global Japanese Studies for graduate students, one of the Graduate Programs for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies.

<text>George Edward Barr (born January 30, 1937) is an American science fiction and fantasy artist.

==Career==
Barr&#x27;s work shows influences from Arthur Rackham, Hannes Bok and Virgil Finlay. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; describes him as one of the least appreciated SF/fantasy artists. His work is often romantic and whimsical. His technique involves overlaying pen and ink line work with pastel watercolors.

Barr began his art career in 1960 by contributing artwork to various high-profile science fiction fanzines in fandom and for many years displaying and selling his artwork in the art shows of both regional science fiction conventions and at the annual World Science Fiction Convention.

A collection of his professional fantasy and science fiction paintings, &quot;Upon the Winds of Yesterday and Other Explorations&quot;, was published by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in 1976. The volume debuted at MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention, where Barr was the convention&#x27;s Fan Guest of Honor, along with Robert A. Heinlein, who was the convention&#x27;s professional writer Guest of Honor. Barr provided the full color wrap around dust jacket for the convention&#x27;s hardcover program book.

Since then Barr has provided numerous black and white interior illustrations and dozens of full color covers for various professional science fiction magazines and for dozens of science fiction and fantasy book covers. He has also illustrated &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game supplements, including 1987&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot;, the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Design Kit&quot;, and several books in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Gamebooks&quot; line.

==Personal life==
George Barr was born in Tucson, Arizona, grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, and later moved to Northern California.

<text>Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham, Marchioness of Antrim, 18th Baroness de Ros of Helmsley (&quot;née&quot; Lady Katherine Manners; died 1649) was an English aristocrat. The daughter and heiress of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, she was known as the richest woman in Britain outside of the royal family. She married first George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the favourite, and possibly lover, of King James I of England; and secondly, she married the Irish peer Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.

==Family==
Lady Katherine Manners was the only daughter of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, by his first wife, Frances Knyvet (d. before 26 November 1605), widow of Sir William Bevill of Killigarth or Kilkhampton, Cornwall, and third daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire, by Elizabeth Stumpe, the daughter of Sir James Stumpe of Bromham, Wiltshire.

In 1613 Katherine and several of her relatives fell ill at their home in Belvoir Castle, and her brother Henry died. In 1619 two former servants were convicted of having used witchcraft to attack the family.

==Marriage==

In 1619, King James I let it be known that he wished his favourite George Villiers to marry. Katherine Manners was selected by the formidably ambitious Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham, to marry her son. However, Manners was a strict Roman Catholic, and the King refused to allow Villiers to marry her (almost the only occasion when he did not give the Villiers family whatever they asked for). In addition to this, the Earl of Rutland refused to accept the Countess of Buckingham&#x27;s demands for his daughter&#x27;s dowry. Manners converted to Protestantism, to satisfy the Villiers family, which almost caused her father to call off the marriage. Invited to visit the Countess of Buckingham, Katherine was forced to spend the night due to an attack of illness. Believing his daughter&#x27;s honour to be compromised, the Earl of Rutland refused to receive her back, and demanded that George Villiers marry her immediately. At first Villiers refused to marry her, but did a few weeks later, on 16 May 1620.

The marriage took place quietly in London at Lumley House near Tower Hill. There was a larger celebration in August 1621, at Burley, in Rutland. Buckingham produced and performed in Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;The Gypsies Metamorphosed&quot;. Nicholas Lanier supervised the music. King James and Prince Charles were present.

==Duchess of Buckingham==
The Duchess of Buckingham was one of the few women of rank of the time whose &quot;gentleness and womanly tenderness, devotion and purity of life&quot;, were conspicuous in the midst of the &quot;almost universal corruption and immorality of the Court&quot;. No scandal was ever breathed against her name, and the worst that was ever said of her was that by her influence she at one time nearly persuaded her husband to become a Roman Catholic, she herself having returned to her own faith soon after her marriage. She was however jealous of Lucy Percy&#x27;s relationship with her husband.

The court physician, Theodore Turquet de Mayerne, examined her on 24 January 1622 when she was pregnant. Frances Stewart, Duchess of Lennox looked after her when she was ill and pregnant, making her broths and caudles. She was the mother of Mary Villiers, Duchess of Richmond and of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (who inherited her title as 19th Baron de Ros).

She wrote to her husband in July 1623, when he was with Prince Charles in Spain. She described her infant daughter Mary, &quot;pretty Moll&quot;, who was not yet walking, but danced and shook her apron at the tune of a sarabande or the song &quot;Tom Duff&quot;, and would clap to a clapping dance. She would send him her picture painted by Balthazar Gerbier.

In London, she resided at Wallingford House and York House. Her rooms included the Red and Green closets or cabinets, decorated with small old master paintings. These spaces probably resembled the surviving contemporary Green closet at Ham House. A surviving pair of chairs carved in an Italian style, and painted with Villiers and Manners heraldry, may have been used in a gallery.

==Countess of Antrim==
Katherine&#x27;s first husband, Buckingham, was assassinated in 1628 by John Felton. Upon the death of her father in 1632, without male heirs, she succeeded suo jure to the ancient barony of de Ros. In 1635 she married Randal McDonnell, Earl of Antrim, and went to live at Dunluce Castle, County Antrim, Ireland. She employed the London furniture maker Ralph Grynder.

Following the Catholic uprising in Ulster in 1641 the MacDonnell family moved south to Wexford, then Waterford, where Katherine died in 1649. She was buried outside the walls of Waterford and it is speculated that she may have been a victim of the plague. Her possessions passed to her son and her effigy was added beside that of her first husband in Westminster Abbey.

==Countries served==
As at December 2014, Coca-Cola Amatil employed 14,700 people in six countries across the Asia-Pacific region. The company was the bottler of Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa.

==Ownership==
Coca-Cola Amatil was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with The Coca-Cola Company holding around one third of the shares, as it did with each of its primary or &quot;anchor&quot; bottlers in the worldwide Coca-Cola system. Amatil and The Coca-Cola Company were also joint owners of Coca-Cola Bottling Indonesia (CCBI).

==History==
The company&#x27;s Australian origins date to 1903 as the tobacco company British Tobacco (Australia). Its first foray into soft drinks came in 1964 with the purchase of Coca-Cola Bottlers (Perth), and the company was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1972. Soft drinks and snack foods gradually became the primary focus of the company, and it was eventually renamed Allied Manufacturing and Trade Industries Limited in 1973 and Amatil Limited in 1977. It began to expand bottling operations overseas in Europe, purchasing a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Australia in 1982 and expanding into Fiji and New Zealand in 1987. A majority stake was purchased by The Coca-Cola Company in 1989. In the same year Amatil ceased its involvement in cigarette manufacturing with the sale of its WD &amp; HO Wills division to British American Tobacco.

Amatil&#x27;s snack food operations were sold in 1992, and its European operations were spun off into a new company, Coca-Cola Beverages, in 1998. Expansion into Asia continued, though Filipino bottling was eventually sold to San Miguel Brewery and parent The Coca-Cola Company. Amatil had facilities all over Australia, with key sites at Northmead (NSW), North Sydney (NSW), Richlands (QLD), Moorabbin (VIC) and Hazelmere (WA). CCA announced on 22 February 2017 that it would be closing the Thebarton site on Port Road early in 2019 as there was no space to expand it, and expanding the Richlands site in Queensland. From 2006 to 2011, Amatil operated a joint venture (named Pacific Beverages) with SABMiller to distribute its drinks in Australia. In 2011, SABMiller acquired Foster&#x27;s Group and full ownership of Pacific Beverages; in exchange, Foster&#x27;s sold its Fiji and Samoa operations to Amatil in 2012.

In May 2021, CCA was acquired by Coca-Cola European Partners for A$9.8 billion, forming the new largest Coca-Cola bottling firm Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. At the time of the sale, Amatil&#x27;s group managing director was Alison Watkins, and the board chairman was Ilana Atlas.

==Container deposit schemes==
Coca-Cola Amatil opposed proposals for Northern Territory and Western Australian container deposit schemes between 2011 and 2013. Former Northern Territory treasurer Delia Lawrie claimed that Coca-Cola offered to fund her political opponents (the Country Liberal Party), to oppose a container deposit scheme, a claim the company strongly denied.

In 2013, Coca-Cola Amatil joined with Schweppes and Lion in a legal challenge against the Northern Territory Government&#x27;s &#x27;Cash for Containers&#x27; recycling scheme arguing it breached Australia&#x27;s Mutual Recognition Act 1992. This Act creates a legal requirement that &quot;goods produced in or imported into the first State, that may lawfully be sold in that State... (may) be sold in the second State.&quot; Beverage companies argued that the recently introduced Cash for Containers scheme, which doubled recycling rates to 30% in the Northern Territory in the limited time it operated, hindered this right by requiring the company to implement different production processes for the same product in different states and territories. The Federal Court ruled in favour of the beverage companies. The ruling created a public backlash with hostile posts on Coca-Cola&#x27;s Facebook page and calls for a boycott.

Coca-Cola Amatil argued that the Cash for Containers scheme was ineffective and costly suggesting a &quot;National Bin Network&quot; as an alternative solution. The Council of Australian Governments found the economic cost of a national container deposit scheme would be between $1.4 and $1.76 billion; however, research undertaken by the Boomerang Alliance in 2008 suggested that such a scheme would in fact bring about saving of up to $84 million. Organisations such as Keep Australia Beautiful and the Boomerang Alliance supported the initiative as an addition to Cash for Containers, but argued that if used alone it would make a comparatively insignificant difference to recycling rates.

Former Northern Territory Chief Minister, Terry Mills, stated that he would continue to fight against Coca-Cola for Cash for Containers and called on other States and Territories to support the Scheme.

<doc id="1098416" wikidata="Q512990" url="?curid=1098416" title="Anti-Russian sentiment">
<text>Anti-Russian sentiment or Russophobia is dislike or fear or hatred of Russia, Russian people, or Russian culture. The opposite of Russophobia is Russophilia.

Historically, Russophobia has included state-sponsored and grassroots mistreatment and discrimination, as well as propaganda containing anti-Russian sentiment. In Europe, Russophobia was based on various more or less fantastic fears of Russian conquest of Europe, such as those based on The Will of Peter the Great forgery documented in France in the 19th century and later resurfacing in Britain as a result of fears of a Russian attack on British-colonized India in relation to the Great Game. Pre-existing anti-Russian sentiment in Germany is considered to be one of the factors influencing treatment of Russian population under German occupation during World War II.

Nowadays, a variety of popular culture clichés and negative stereotypes about Russians still exist, notably in the Western world. Some individuals may have prejudice or hatred against Russians due to history, racism, propaganda, or ingrained stereotypes.
Negative views of Russia are widespread, but most prevalent in Western liberal democracies.

Some analysts have argued that official Western rhetoric and journalism about Russian actions abroad, such as the Second Chechen War, the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. and Russian interference in the 2016 United States election, have contributed to the resurgence of anti-Russian sentiment.
Anti-Russian sentiment rose considerably after the start of the Russian war against Ukraine in 2014.
By the summer of 2020, the majority of Western nations had unfavorable views of Russia.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian-speaking immigrants experienced harassment, open hostility and discrimination.

Some researchers have described use of &quot;Russophobia&quot; narratives to be a tactic used by Vladimir Putin. These narratives emphasize the belief that Russia faces an existential threat from the Western powers and must take drastic measures to ensure domestic stability including support for the ongoing war in Ukraine. Such narratives have been described as Russian imperialism.

==History in Europe==
Anti-Russian sentiment in Europe has a long history, dating back several centuries. Initially, it was largely driven by religious and cultural differences, as well as Russia&#x27;s expansionist policies. This sentiment has evolved over time, but the underlying themes of perceived barbarism, imperialism, and cultural inferiority have remained constant.

=== 15th to 17th century ===
Negative views of Russia in Europe began to take shape in the 15th century during the period of Russian expansion into non-Russian lands under Ivan III. Russia&#x27;s campaigns against Poland-Lithuania, Livonian cities, and Swedish-held Finland marked the beginning of a perception of Russia as a threat. During this era, Russia was often portrayed as a barbaric, un-Christian, and imperialistic nation by its European adversaries. Michael C. Paul argued that the crusades of the 13th century against Russian Christian cities like Novgorod and Pskov may highlight even more deeply rooted religious and cultural animosity.

During the Livonian War (1558–83), European powers, particularly Poland-Lithuania and the Livonian German cities, intensified their negative perception of Russia. They imposed embargoes on war supplies to Russia, fearing the possibility of it receiving military supplies from England, which had an active trade mission in Russia. Queen Elizabeth denied the accusations.

Contemporaries described Tsardom of Russia and early Russian Empire as a barbaric enemy of Christianity. Accounts by Western travelers like Austrian Ambassador Sigismund von Herberstein and English Ambassador Giles Fletcher in the 16th century portrayed Russia in a negative light, focusing on aspects like superstition, brutality, and backwardness. Negative views persisted into the 17th and 18th centuries, with Western observers continuing to highlight aspects like superstition, drunkenness, and barbaric practices in Russian society. Notable figures like Captain John Perry and French travelers Jacques Margeret and Jean Chappe d&#x27;Auteroche contributed to these perceptions, often comparing Russian society unfavorably with Western standards.
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

On 19 October 1797, the French Directory received a document from a Polish general, Michał Sokolnicki, entitled &quot;Aperçu sur la Russie&quot;. This forgery is known as the so-called &quot;The Will of Peter the Great&quot; and was first published in October 1812, during the Napoleonic wars, in Charles Louis-Lesur&#x27;s much-read &quot;Des progrès de la puissance russe&quot;: this was at the behest of Napoleon I, who ordered a series of articles to be published showing that &quot;Europe is inevitably in the process of becoming booty for Russia&quot;. Subsequent to the Napoleonic wars, propaganda against Russia was continued by Napoleon&#x27;s former confessor, Dominique Georges-Frédéric de Pradt, who in a series of books portrayed Russia as a power-grasping &quot;barbaric&quot; power hungry to conquer Europe. With reference to Russia&#x27;s new constitutional laws in 1811 the Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre wrote the now famous statement: &quot;Every nation gets the government it deserves&quot; (&quot;Toute nation a le gouvernement qu&#x27;elle mérite&quot;).

Beginning from 1815 and lasting roughly until 1840, British commentators began criticizing the perceived conservatism of the Russian state and its resistance to reform efforts. In 1836, The Westminster Review attributed growth of British navy to &quot;Ministers [that] are smitten with the epidemic disease of Russo-phobia&quot;. However, Russophobia in Britain for the rest of the 19th century was primarily related to British fears that the Russian conquest of Central Asia was a precursor to an attack on British-colonized India. These fears led to the &quot;Great Game&quot;, a series of political and diplomatic confrontations between Britain and Russia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1843 the Marquis de Custine published his hugely successful 1800-page, four-volume travelogue &quot;La Russie en 1839&quot;. Custine&#x27;s scathing narrative reran what were by now clichés which presented Russia as a place where &quot;the veneer of European civilization was too thin to be credible&quot;. Such was its huge success that several official and pirated editions quickly followed, as well as condensed versions and translations in German, Dutch, and English. By 1846 approximately 200 thousand copies had been sold.

In 1867, Fyodor Tyutchev, a Russian poet, diplomat and member of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery, introduced the actual term of &quot;russophobia&quot; in a letter to his daughter Anna Aksakova on 20 September 1867, where he applied it to a number of pro-Western Russian liberals who, pretending that they were merely following their liberal principles, developed a negative attitude towards their own country and always stood on a pro-Western and anti-Russian position, regardless of any changes in the Russian society and having a blind eye on any violations of these principles in the West, &quot;violations in the sphere of justice, morality, and even civilization&quot;. He put the emphasis on the irrationality of this sentiment. Tyutchev saw Western anti-Russian sentiment as the result of misunderstanding caused by civilizational differences between East and West.

=== German atrocities in World War II ===

Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party regarded Slavic peoples (especially Poles and East Slavs) as non-Aryan &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhumans). As early as 1925, Hitler suggested in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that the German people needed &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) to achieve German expansion eastwards (&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;) at the expense of the inferior Slavs. Hitler believed that &quot;the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only a wonderful example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race.&quot;

After the invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler expressed his plans for the Slavs:

Plans to eliminate Russians and other Slavs from Soviet territory to allow German settlement included starvation. American historian Timothy D. Snyder maintains that there were 4.2 million victims of the German Hunger Plan in the Soviet Union, &quot;largely Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians,&quot; including 3.1 million Soviet POWs and 1.0 million civilian deaths in the Siege of Leningrad. According to Snyder, Hitler intended eventually to exterminate up to 45 million Slavs by planned famine as part of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;.

Influenced by the guidelines, in a directive sent out to the troops under his command, General Erich Hoepner of the 4th Panzer Army stated:
=== Cold War ===

Russophobic stereotypes of an illiberal tradition were also favored by Cold War historiographers, even as scholars of early Russia debunked such essentialist notions.

Widely criticized for being antisemitic and extremist nationalistic, Igor Shafarevich&#x27;s 1981 work &quot;Russophobia&quot; blamed &quot;Jews seeking world rule&quot; for alleged &quot;vast conspiracy against Russia and all mankind&quot; and seeking destruction of Russia through adoption of a Western-style democracy.

=== After 1989 ===

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the collapse of Communism, anti-Russian sentiment in the United States was at an all-time low. However, it has experienced a resurgence during the late 1990s due to Russia&#x27;s opposition to the enlargement of NATO. According to a Gallup poll, 59% of surveyed Americans viewed Russia negatively in 1999, compared to 25% in 1991.

Anatol Lieven considered the Western commentary on the Second Chechen War and a Russian reaction to eastward NATO enlargement to be the main cause of growing Russophobia in the 90s. Condemning the brutality of the Russian army and an exaggerated fear of NATO, he argued that the influence of the elites and ethnic lobbies, coupled with 19th century stereotypes about Russian expansionism led Western journalists and intellectuals to drop professional standards and engage in propaganda, spreading Russophobia and national hatred. In April 2007, David Johnson, founder of the Johnson&#x27;s Russia List, said in interview to the Moscow News: &quot;I am sympathetic to the view that these days Putin and Russia are perhaps getting too dark a portrayal in most Western media. Or at least that critical views need to be supplemented with other kinds of information and analysis. An openness to different views is still warranted.&quot; California-based international relations scholar Andrei Tsygankov has remarked that anti-Russian political rhetoric coming from Washington circles has received wide echo in American mainstream media, asserting that &quot;Russophobia&#x27;s revival is indicative of the fear shared by some U.S. and European politicians that their grand plans to control the world&#x27;s most precious resources and geostrategic sites may not succeed if Russia&#x27;s economic and political recovery continues.&quot; In contrast, Krystyna Kurczab-Redlich and some other reporters active in Chechnya alarmed already in early 2000s that Putin&#x27;s true nature and intentions have been exposed by the Russian atrocities during the Second Chechen War as by no means resembling those of a Western democrat. It was, however, convenient for the Western elites to brand these reports as Russophobic and disregard them, in spite of such reports being delivered also by Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist and human rights activist, later assassinated. The first among these views has ultimately suffered utter discreditation in a humiliating manner after 2014, primarily because it was inherently flawed as it focused exclusively on the fantastic motivations behind anti-Russian sentiment in Western Europe, while entirely disregarding the precisely specified reasons of negative views of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe which stem in turn from real experience and knowledge.

In October 2004, the International Gallup Organization announced that according to its poll, anti-Russia sentiment remained fairly strong throughout Europe and the West in general. It found that Russia was the least popular G-8 country globally. Overall, the percentage of respondents with a positive view of Russia was only 31%.

Anti-Russian sentiment in the United States and Western European countries decreased during the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev, with about half of respondents in US, UK, Germany, Spain and France having positive views of Russia in 2011. It began to increase again after 2012. The Transatlantic Trends 2012 Report indicated that &quot;views of Russia turned from favorable to unfavorable on both sides of the Atlantic&quot;, noting that most Americans and Europeans, as well as many Russians, said that they were not confident that the election results expressed the will of voters.

Attitudes towards Russia in most countries worsened considerably following Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, the subsequent fomenting of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine and its intervention in the resulting War in Donbas. From 2013 to 2014, the median negative attitudes in Europe rose from 54% to 75%, and from 43% to 72% in the United States. Negative attitudes also rose compared to 2013 throughout the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and Africa.

According to political scientist Peter Schulze, the accusations of collusion with Trump campaign, coupled with the criminal case of Lisa F., which was reported in Germany as an instance of Russia&#x27;s hybrid war, sparked fears that the Kremlin could meddle in German campaigns as well, resulting in growth of anti-Russian sentiment in Germany after 2016.

By the summer of 2020, majority of Western nations had unfavorable views of Russia, with an exception of Italy, which was attributed by Pew Research Center to a delivery of medical aid by Moscow early during the pandemic.

85% of Americans polled by Gallup between 1 and 17 February 2022 had unfavorable view of Russia.

===2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
There was a sharp uptick in manifestations of anti-Russian sentiment after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; following the start of the invasion, anti-Russian sentiment soared across the Western world. Since the invasion commenced, ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking immigrants from post-Soviet states are globally reporting rising instances of open hostility and discrimination towards them. This hostility is not just towards Russian people; it has also been seen directed towards businesses as well.

A &quot;pervasive climate of distrust&quot; towards Russian passport holders in Europe and rejections of bank account applications because of nationality were reported.
United Kingdom limited how much Russian nationals are allowed to save on bank accounts. The banking industry considered the restriction to violate UK equality laws, which forbid discrimination by nationality.
Leonid Gozman called European restrictions discriminatory and said that they harmed dissidents who were forced to leave Russia, leaving them without means to survive.

Outrage was caused by pro-war demonstrations held in Athens, Berlin, Dublin, Hanover, Frankfurt and Limassol, consisting of &quot;vehicles emblazoned with the pro-war Z symbol and marches attended by hundreds of flag-waving nationalists&quot;. Experts surveyed by &quot;The Times&quot; said that the rallies were likely coordinated by the Kremlin via the soft power Rossotrudnichestvo agency, stressing that a &quot;bottom-up element&quot; of support for Russia also exists.

By 2023, the most negative perception of Russia was in Ukraine (net negative 79%), followed by Portugal with 69%, Japan with 68%, and Poland with 68%, according to the 2023 Democracy Perception Index.

== As a polemic device ==
The Kremlin and its supporters are sometimes criticised for using allegations of &quot;Russophobia&quot; as a form of propaganda to counter criticism of government policy. Sources critical of the Russian government claim that it is Russian state-owned media and administration who attempt to discredit the &quot;neutral&quot; criticism by generalizing it into indiscriminate accusations of the whole Russian population – or Russophobia. In 2006, poet and essayist Lev Rubinstein wrote that similarly to the term &quot;fascism&quot;, the term &quot;Russophobia&quot; has become a political sticker slapped onto people who disagree with words or actions of people or organizations who position themselves as &quot;Russian ones&quot; in the ideological, rather than an ethnic or geographical sense.

Russian responses to outside anti-Russian criticism has intensified the growth of contemporary Russian nationalist ideology, which in many ways mirrors its predecessor, Soviet nationalism. Sociologist Anatoly Khazanov states that there&#x27;s a national-patriotic movement which believes that there&#x27;s a &quot;clash of civilizations, a global struggle between the materialistic, individualistic, consumerist, cosmopolitan, corrupt, and led by the United States and the idealist, collectivist, morally and spiritually superior Eurasia led by Russia.&quot; In their view, the United States wants to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their beliefs.

Joseph Stiglitz wrote that these attitudes are reinforced by the failure of the post-Soviet liberal economic reforms, which are perceived to have been influenced by the US Treasury. A mismatch between U.S. rhetoric about promoting democratic reforms in Russia and actual U.S. actions and policy has been said to cause deep resentment among Russians, helping Russian propaganda to construct a narrative of U.S. malign interference.

Since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and subsequent sanctions, there was a rapid growth of charges of Russophobia in the official discourse. Use of the term on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website rose dramatically during the period between 2014 and 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin compared Russophobia to antisemitism. Academic Jade McGlynn considered conflation of modern Russophobia and Nazi antisemitism to be a part of propaganda strategy that uses historical framing to create a flattering narrative that the Russo-Ukrainian War is a restaging of the Great Patriotic War. Kathryn Stoner and Michael McFaul explained the turn to radical nationalism as a strategy to preserve the regime within domestic economical and political pressures, claiming that &quot;To maintain his argument for legitimacy at home, Putin needs... constant confrontation that supports the narrative that Russia is under siege from the West, that Russia is at war with the United States.&quot;

A Russian political scientist and a senior visiting fellow at the George Washington University Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies Maria Lipman said that this narrative was made more convincing by imposing sanctions on Russia and supporting Ukraine with weapons, as well as by statements about weakening Russia made by American establishment, amplified on Russian television.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported effectiveness of using the label of &quot;Russophobia&quot; by Russian propaganda to sustain support for the invasion of Ukraine by presenting it as an existential confrontation with the West. According to an independent polling agency, &quot;people explain that a significant part of the world is against us and it&#x27;s only Putin who hopes to hold onto Russia, otherwise we would be eaten up completely. To them it is Russia that is defending itself&quot;.

==By country==

===South Caucasus===

====Armenia====
After Nicholas II intensified russification policies and did not provide significant opposition to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s massacres against Armenians, anti-Russian sentiment among Armenian nationalist groups rose. After the Russian government confiscated Armenian Church lands in 1903, this led to attacks on Russian authorities and Armenians who cooperated with them by Armenians mobilised by the ARF party.

In July 1988, during the Karabakh movement, the killing of an Armenian man and the injury of tens of others by the Soviet army in a violent clash at Zvartnots Airport near Yerevan sparked anti-Russian and anti-Soviet demonstrations. In 2015, relations between Armenia and Russia were strained after the massacre of an Armenian family of 7 in Gyumri by a Russian serviceman, stationed at the Russian base there.

Relations between Armenia and Russia have worsened in recent years, due to Russia&#x27;s refusal to help Armenia in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and the September 2022 Armenia–Azerbaijan clashes, as well as due to statements perceived to be anti-Armenian made by figures close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. This has resulted in anti-Russian sentiment rising sharply in the country.

====Azerbaijan====

The 1990 Black January massacre prior to Azerbaijani independence and Russia&#x27;s complicated role in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Azerbaijan and Armenia increased the negative perception of Russia. Under Abulfaz Elchibey&#x27;s presidency in 1992–93, relations between Russia and Azerbaijan were damaged due to his anti-Russian policies, however under Ilham Aliyev, relations instead improved.

====Georgia====
There has been increased animosity towards Russians in Tbilisi after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has also been directed towards exiled Russians who recently fled their home country. It has included signs from businesses and posts from Airbnb hosts declaring “Russians not welcome”, anti-Russian graffiti found on many central streets, the famous Bassiani nightclub banning anyone with a Russian passport, and an online petition signed by thousands of locals demanding tougher immigration rules for Russians.

Accordingly, in March 2022 a strong majority of 84% of respondents to a Georgian poll said Russia is the enemy of Georgia, a sharp uptick compared with a decade earlier. According to a 2012 poll, 35% of Georgians perceived Russia as Georgia&#x27;s biggest enemy. Furthermore, in a February 2013 poll a majority of 63% said Russia is Georgia&#x27;s biggest political and economic threat as opposed to 35% of those who looked at Russia as the most important partner for Georgia. In November 2023, 11% preferred closer ties with Russia, while abandoning western ties, and 25% wanted to deepen ties with Russia.

The root of the Georgian anti-Russian sentiment lies in the history of Russian colonialism of Transcaucasia. For Georgians, the country was twice occupied and annexed by Russia. First in 1801 under the Tsarist regime, and then, after a short interlude of independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918–1921), a 70-year period of forceful Soviet occupation. This sentiment was further fed by the events of the 1990s, when Russia supported the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two historically inalienable parts of Georgia, causing the Abkhaz–Georgian conflict, the Georgian–Ossetian conflict and later the war with Russia in 2008. It was also followed by Georgian sympathy to the Chechens during the Chechen–Russian conflict of the 1990s.

===Rest of Europe===
In a 2012 survey, the percentage of Russian immigrants in the EU that indicated that they had experienced racially motivated hate crimes was 5%, which is less than the average of 10% reported by several groups of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the EU. 17% of Russian immigrants in the EU said that they had been victims of crimes in the preceding 12 months, as compared to an average of 24% among several groups of immigrants and ethnic minorities.

====Baltics====

In 2015, the chairman of the Russian State Duma&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee Aleksey Pushkov alleged that Russophobia had become the state policy in the Baltic states and in 2021 Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov accused the Baltic states of being &quot;the leaders of the Russophobic minority&quot; in NATO and the European Union.

===== Estonia =====
A poll conducted by Gallup International suggested that 34% Estonians have a positive attitude towards Russia, but it is supposed that survey results were likely impacted by a large ethnic Russian minority in the country. However, in a 2012 poll only 3% of the Russian minority in Estonia reported that they had experienced a hate crime (as compared to an average of 10% among ethnic minorities and immigrants in EU).

According to Estonian philosopher Jaan Kaplinski, the birth of anti-Russian sentiment in Estonia dates back to 1940, as there was little or none during the czarist and first independence period, when anti-German sentiment predominated. Kaplinski states the imposition of Soviet rule under Joseph Stalin in 1940 and subsequent actions by Soviet authorities led to the replacement of anti-German sentiment with anti-Russian sentiment within just one year, and characterized it as &quot;one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet authorities&quot;. Kaplinski supposes that anti-Russian sentiment could disappear as quickly as anti-German sentiment did in 1940, however he believes the prevailing sentiment in Estonia is sustained by Estonia&#x27;s politicians who employ &quot;the use of anti-Russian sentiments in political combat,&quot; together with the &quot;tendentious attitude of the [Estonian] media.&quot; Kaplinski says that a &quot;rigid East-West attitude is to be found to some degree in Estonia when it comes to Russia, in the form that everything good comes from the West and everything bad from the East&quot;; this attitude, in Kaplinski&#x27;s view, &quot;probably does not date back further than 1940 and presumably originates from Nazi propaganda.&quot;

===== Latvia =====

According to The Moscow Times, Latvia&#x27;s fears of Russia are rooted in recent history, including conflicting views on whether Latvia and other Baltic states were occupied by the USSR or joined it voluntarily, as well as the 1940–1941 June and 1949 March deportations that followed and more recently the annexation of Crimea that fueled a fear that Latvia could also be annexed by Russia. Russian-American journalist and broadcaster Vladimir Pozner believed the fact that many Russian migrants in the Latvian SSR did not learn Latvian and expected the local population to speak Russian also contributed to an accumulation of anti-Russian sentiment.

No Russians have ever been killed or even wounded for political, nationalistic or racist reasons in Latvia ever since it regained its independence and in a 2012 poll only 2% of the Russian minority in Latvia reported having experienced a &#x27;racially&#x27; motivated hate crime (as compared to an average of 10% among immigrants and minorities in EU). An earlier 2004 research &quot;Ethnic tolerance and integration of the Latvian society&quot; by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences found that Latvian respondents on average rated their relations with Russians 7.8 out of 10, whereas non-Latvian respondents rated their relationship with Latvians 8.4 out of 10. Both groups believed that the ties between them were satisfactory, had not changed in the last five years and were to either remain the same or improve in the next five years. 66% of non-Russian respondents said they would also support their son or daughter marrying an ethnic Russian. Respondents did mention some ethnic conflicts, but all of them were classified as psycholinguistic such as verbal confrontations.

Occasionally, Russians in Latvia have been targeted by anti-Russian rhetoric from some of the more radical members of both the mainstream and radical right parties in Latvia. In 2010, Civic Union&#x27;s internal e-mail correspondence between Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia Ģirts Valdis Kristovskis and Latvian American doctor and party member Aivars Slucis was leaked. In one of the e-mails titled &quot;Do Latvians Surrender?&quot; Slucis complained of the current situation in Latvia and being unable to return and work in Latvia, because he would not be able to treat Russians in the same way as Latvians. Kristovskis agreed with his opinion and evaluation, but warned against hysterical responses, cautioning party members to avoid discussions counterproductive to the party&#x27;s political goals. After the leak the Civic Union ousted Slucis from the party for views unacceptable to the party and returned his financial contributions, while the opposition parties Harmony Centre and For a Good Latvia initiated an unsuccessful vote of no confidence against Kristovskis.

On the other hand, the results of a yearly poll by the research agency &quot;SKDS&quot; showed that the population of Latvia was more split on its attitude towards the Russian Federation. In 2008, 47 percent of respondents had a positive view of Russia and 33% had a negative one, while the remaining 20 percent found it hard to define their opinion. It peaked in 2010 when 64 percent of respondents felt positive towards Russia, in comparison with the 25 percent that felt negative. In 2015, following the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, however, it dropped to the lowest level since 2008 and for the first time, the people with a negative attitude towards Russia (46%) surpassed people with a positive attitude (41%). 43.5 percent also believed Russia posed a military threat to Latvia and even in 2019 that number had decreased only slightly and stood at 37.3 percent.

===== Lithuania =====
Due to historical experiences, there is a fear prevailed in Lithuania that Russia has never stopped wanting to consolidate power over the Baltics, including fears of Russian plans for an eventual annexation of Lithuania as was seen in Crimea. There are also concerns over Russia&#x27;s increasing military deployment, such as in the Russian region of Kaliningrad, an exclave of Russia bordering Lithuania.

====Eastern Europe====

=====Romania=====

Anti-Russian sentiment dates back to the conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires in the 18th and early 19th centuries and the ceding of part of the Moldavian principality to Russia by the Ottoman Empire in 1812 after its &quot;de facto&quot; annexation, and to the annexations during World War II and after by the Soviet Union of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia and the policies of ethnic cleansing, Russification and deportations that have taken place in those territories against ethnic Romanians. Following WWII, Romania, a former ally of Nazi Germany, was occupied by Soviet forces. Soviet dominance over the Romanian economy was manifested through the so-called Sovroms, exacting a tremendous economic toll ostensibly as war-time reparations.

The emergence of anti-Russian sentiment in the Danubian Principalities, the precursors to unified Romania which became independent of the Ottoman Empire with the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople concluding the 1828–1829 Russo-Turkish War, arose from the post-1829 relationship of the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia to Russia, and was caused by mutually economic and political grievances of two influential classes that were often odds also with each other. As per the 1829 treaty, Russia was named the protector of the two principalities, allowed to occupy them, and also drafted a quasi-constitution known as the Organic Regulations which formed a powerful assembly of 800 boyars (the local landowning economic elite) nominally under the authority of the less nominal prince, the document crafted with strong support from the boyars. The boyars, a &quot;reactionary oligarchy&quot; as described by Misha Glenny, stopped short any hint of liberal reform, and the growing urban elite began to associate Russia with the slow progress of reform and the obstacles they faced in building an industrial base. On the other hand, the boyars themselves began to sour on Russia during the 1830s and 1840s due to their economic conflict of interest with Russia. After the Ottomans withdrew from the three forts along the Danube basin, the boyars exploited the highly fertile land to drastically increase Romanian wheat production, such that eventually future Romania consisting of Wallachia unified with Moldavia would become the fourth-largest wheat producer in the world. Whereas before 1829 Wallachian and Moldavian wheat had been limited to Ottoman markets, Russia increasingly felt threatened by growing competition in its jurisdiction that it feared could drive down the price of Russian wheat. Accordingly, Russia exploited its role as protector of the Principalities to let the Danube silt up, sabotaging the possible market competitor. As a result of this as well as &quot;Russian foot-dragging on the economy&quot;, the boyars too became increasingly resentful of Russian domination. The rapid erosion of public relations with Russia led to a revolution in 1848, in which the newly emerging Romanian intellectual and political class sought the help of the Ottomans, their old hegemon, to drive out Russian influence—although, after pressure applied by Russia, the Russian and Ottoman armies joined forces to squash the movement.

=====Ukraine=====

In 2004, the leader of the marginal Svoboda party Oleh Tyahnybok urged his party to fight &quot;the Moscow-Jewish mafia&quot; ruling Ukraine. For these remarks Tyahnybok was expelled from the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction in July 2004. The former coordinator of Right Sector in West Ukraine, Oleksandr Muzychko talked about fighting &quot;communists, Jews and Russians for as long as blood flows in my veins.&quot;

In May 2009, a poll held by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in Ukraine said that 96% of respondents were positive about Russians as an ethnic group, 93% respected the Russian Federation and 76% respected the Russian establishment.

In October 2010, statistics by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine said that positive attitudes towards Russians have been decreasing since 1994. In response to a question gauging tolerance of Russians, 15% of Western Ukrainians responded positively. In Central Ukraine, 30% responded positively (from 60% in 1994); 60% responded positively in Southern Ukraine (from 70% in 1994); and 64% responded positively in Eastern Ukraine (from 75% in 1994). Furthermore, 6–7% of Western Ukrainians would banish Russians entirely from Ukraine, and 7–8% in Central Ukraine responded similarly. This level of sentiment was not found in Southern or Eastern Ukraine.

The ultranationalist party Svoboda (once prominent, but now marginal), has invoked radical anti-Russian rhetoric and has electoral support enough to garner majority support in local councils, as seen in the Ternopil regional council in Western Ukraine. Analysts explained Svoboda&#x27;s victory in Eastern Galicia during the 2010 Ukrainian local elections as a result of the policies of the Azarov Government who were seen as too pro-Russian by the voters of &quot;Svoboda&quot;. According to Andreas Umland, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Svoboda&#x27;s increasing exposure in the Ukrainian media has contributed to these successes. According to British academic Taras Kuzio the presidency of Viktor Yanukovich (2010–2014) fabricated this exposure in order to discredit the opposition. Since the Euromaidan revolution, the Svoboda party lost a lot of its support. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Svoboda formed a united party list with the Governmental Initiative of Yarosh, Right Sector and National Corps. The united list received only 2.15% of the votes, less than half of the 5% election threshold, and thus no parliamentary seats via the national party list.

According to the Brookings Institution after Ukraine regained its independence, only a small minority of nationalists expressed strong anti-Russian views; the majority hoped to have good relations with Russia. In 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the attitude to Russia changed sharply. In April 2017, a poll by Sociological group &quot;RATING&quot; found that 57% of respondents expressed a &quot;very cold&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; attitude toward Russia while 17% expressed a &quot;very warm&quot; or &quot;warm&quot; attitude. In February 2019, 77% of Ukrainians had a positive attitude towards Russians, 57% of Ukrainians had a positive view of Russia, but only 13% of Ukrainians had positive attitude towards the Russian government. Sentiments due to the 2022 war have declined enormously. In March 2022, 97% of Ukrainians said they had an unfavourable view of Russian President Putin, with a further 81% saying they had a very unfavourable or somewhat unfavourable view of the Russian people. However, 65% of Ukrainians agreed that &quot;despite our differences there is more that unites ethnic Russians living in Ukraine and Ukrainians than divides us.&quot; Ukrainian officials are working to rid the country&#x27;s cities of streets named after Russian historical figures like Tchaikovsky or Tolstoy. According to historian at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv , this is being done to undo the Russian propaganda &quot;of the so-called Russkiy Mir—the Russian-speaking world&quot; by creating &quot;a powerful alternative, a modern Ukrainian national discourse.”

====Central Europe====
=====Czech Republic=====
Russia remains continuously among the most negatively perceived countries among Czechs in polls conducted since 1991, and just 26% of Czechs responded that they had a positive opinion about Russia in November 2016.

According to writer Tim Nollen in 2008, Russians in Czechia were almost universally disliked as a people due in part to the presence of Russian mafiosi, as well as the &quot;arrogant hordes of Russian visitors that descend upon Prague and the Spas in Karlovy Vary&quot;.

Following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, anti-Russian tensions rose in the country. Martin Dlouhý, a professor at the Prague University of Economics and Business, wrote on Facebook on February 24 that he would not conduct, test, or correct the final thesis of Russian students “due to conscience and moral principles”; but deleted the post after a strong backlash. Violence in elementary schools prompted attack by students on their ethnic Russian classmates, prompting a condemnation by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Many Czech shops and restaurants put up signs saying that Russians and Belarusians were not allowed.

=====Poland=====
In 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported after the Polish daily &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot; that &quot;relations between the nations are as bad as they have been since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989.&quot; Jakub Boratyński, the director of international programs at the independent Polish think tank Stefan Batory Foundation, said in 2005 that anti-Russian feelings have substantially decreased since Poland joined the EU and NATO, and that Poles feel more secure than before, but he also admitted that many people in Poland still look suspiciously at Russian foreign-policy moves and are afraid Russia is seeking to &quot;recreate an empire in a different form.&quot; According to Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Moscow-based think tank Center for Political Technologies, much of the modern anti-Russian feelings in Poland is caused by grievances of the past. One contentious issue is the Katyn massacre in 1940 as well as the Stalinist-era ethnic-cleansing operations including the deportation of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Poles, even though the Russian government has officially acknowledged and apologized for the atrocity.

According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 19% of Poles viewed Russia&#x27;s influence positively, with 49% expressing a negative view. According to a &quot;Gazeta.pl&quot; report in 2019, some Polish hoteliers disliked Russian guests, and the vice president of Poland&#x27;s Chamber of Tourism admitted back in 2014 that some private guesthouses were rejecting Russian tourists.

=====Hungary=====

Hungary&#x27;s relations with Russia are shadowed by the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 which was crushed with the help of Russian troops as well the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which was brutally crushed by the Red Army and was followed by the mass arrest and imprisonment of Hungarians. The current government of Viktor Orbán is seen as friendlier toward Russia. According to a 2019 survey by Pew Research, 3% of Hungarian respondents had a favourable opinion of Russia, 32% had a somewhat favourable opinion, 31% had a somewhat unfavourable opinion and 16% had a very unfavourable opinion.

====Northern Europe====

=====Norway=====

Norway&#x27;s diplomatic and cultural ties with the West have complicated continuing relations with Russia. A 2017 poll of Norwegians found that 58% believe that Vladimir Putin and Russia pose a security threat.

Russian officials escalated the tensions. A Russian deputy foreign minister stated in Oslo that Russia views the October 2018 Trident Juncture NATO military exercises in Norway to be &quot;anti-Russian&quot; in nature. Russian expansion in the Arctic has contributed to increasing mutual distrust between Russia and Norway. Norway&#x27;s perceptions of Russian militarism and regional antagonism, as well as Norway&#x27;s hosting of the US Marine Corps in the country, have contributed to the deterioration of relations between Norway and Russia.

=====Finland=====
In Finland, anti-Russian sentiment has been studied since the 1970s. The history of anti-Russian sentiment has two main theories. One of them claims that Finns and Russians have been archenemies throughout history. The position is considered to have been dominated at least the 1700s since the days of the Greater Wrath. This view largely assumes that through the centuries, &quot;Russia is a violent slayer and Finland is an innocent, virginal victim&quot;.
Another, perhaps a more plausible view, holds that idea of Russia as the archenemy was only invented during the early years of independence for the purposes of building the national identity.

The Finnish Civil War in 1918 between the Reds and the Whites—won by the Whites—left behind a popular wave of anti-Russian and anti-Communist feelings in Finland. Hundreds of ethnic Russians were executed in 1918 in the city of Vyborg.

According to polls in 2004, 62% of Finnish citizens had a negative view of Russia. In a 2012 poll, 12% of Russian immigrants in Finland reported that they had experienced a racially motivated hate crime (as compared to an average of 10% of immigrants in the EU). A 2012 report by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy said that job applicants with Russian or Russian-sounding names tended to have to send in twice the amount of applications as an applicant with a Finnish name.

====Western Europe====
=====France=====

In the mid 18th century Voltaire gave French intellectuals a positive image, portraying Russia as an opportunity society, in which an all-powerful leaders such as Peter the Great could create a rational and enlightened society by decree. On the other hand, equally influential French enlightenment writers especially Denis Diderot portrayed Russia in dark colours, emphasizing the lack of an enlightenment tradition or a middle class, and a propensity toward harsh dictatorship.

Relations between France and Russian during the 19th century oscillated between one of relative friendship to open conflict. French Emperor Napoleon established a military alliance with Russia, before unsuccessfully launching an invasion of the country in 1812 over Russia&#x27;s refusal to abide by the Continental System. Russophobia in France grew during the 1830s over Russia&#x27;s suppression of the November Uprising in Poland, with the French public fearing the expansion of a militarily strong &quot;Asiatic&quot; power into Europe. This national mood of Russophobia created support in France for going to war with Russia in 1854. Fyodor Dostoyevsky noted in &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1873–1876):Europeans do not trust appearances: “&quot;Grattez le russe et vous verrez le tartare&quot;”, they say (scratch a Russian and you&#x27;ll find a Tatar). That may be true, but this is what occurred to me: do the majority of Russians, in their dealings with Europe, join the extreme left because they are Tatars and have the savage&#x27;s love of destruction, or are they, perhaps, moved by other reasons?&quot;

According to a 2017 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 36% of French people have a favorable view of Russia, with 62% expressing an unfavorable view.

=====United Kingdom=====

Though Anglo-Russian relations were traditionally warm from the 16th to the 18th century, by the beginning of the 19th century Russophobia started to appear in the media. Depictions of Russia by British travel writers and newspaper correspondents described the country &quot;as a semi-barbaric and despotic country&quot;, an image which ingrained itself in the British public consciousness as such depictions were frequently published in the British media; these depictions had the effect of increasing Russophobia in Britain despite growing economic and political ties between the two countries. The Russian conquest of Central Asia was perceived in Britain as being a precursor to an attack on British India and led to the &quot;Great Game&quot;, while the Crimean War between the two countries in 1853–1856 deepened Russophobia in Britain.

In 1874, tension lessened as Queen Victoria&#x27;s second son Prince Alfred married Tsar Alexander II&#x27;s only daughter Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, followed by a state visit to Britain by the tsar. The goodwill lasted no more than three years, when structural forces again pushed the two nations to the verge of war, leading to a re-emergence of Russophobia in Britain. Large outbursts of Russophobia in Britain typically occurred during periods of tense political standoffs, such as the 1904 Dogger Bank incident, when the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy attacked a group of British fishing trawlers in the mistaken belief they were Japanese warships; outrage in Britain led to the Russian government paying compensation to the fishermen involved.

British Russophobia also manifested itself in popular literature of the period; Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; has been seen by some historians as depicting an allegorical narrative in which the eponymous character (representing Imperial Russia) is &quot;destroyed by warriors pledged to the Crown.&quot; However, by the tail end of the 19th century, Russophobia in Britain subsided somewhat as Russian literature, including works written by authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky began to gain a level of popularity in Britain; positive views of the Russian peasantry also started to appear in British writing during this period.

A May 2021 YouGov poll had 73% of British respondents expressing an unfavourable view of Russia, with no other country more negatively viewed in the UK except for Iran at 74% unfavourability. Russian people in the UK, however, generally didn&#x27;t encounter harassment or infringement of their rights based on nationality or ethnicity until 2022.

Some Russians in the UK have reported experiences of local hostility after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Conservative MP Roger Gale called for all Russian nationals to be expelled from the country. Gale acknowledged that most Russians in the UK were not a threat to national security, he believed it was necessary to &quot;send a very harsh message through the Russian people to Putin.&quot; MP Tom Tugendhat also suggested in one occasion that Russian citizens should be expelled from the country. Evgeny Lebedev, a Russian-born British businessman, claimed that businesses and institutions declined to collaborate with the Evening Standard newspaper, which he owns, amid the war in Ukraine, citing anti-Russian sentiment. Poole-born Alexandra Tolstoy had her account closed by NatWest, which she suspected to have happened because of her Russian name.

===North America===
A National Hockey League agent who works with most of the Russian and Belarusian players in the league has claimed that since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, many of his clients have faced extreme harassment because of their nationality and high prominence, including xenophobia and death threats, as have those Russians and Belarusians who play in other professional North American leagues.

==== Canada ====
In February 2022, a Russian Orthodox Church in Calgary was vandalized with red paint. On 4 March 2022, a parish of the Russian Orthodox Church in Victoria, British Columbia was painted blood red by vandals, possibly in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The next day, the colours of the Ukrainian flag were spray painted on the doors of a Vancouver Russian Community Centre. The Calgary Police Service announced in March they were investigating reports of anti-Russia hate speech and harassment on social media.

In October 2022, numerous threats were made towards individuals affiliated with a Russian Orthodox Church in Calgary. Police stated, &quot;As it is believed the church was targeted because of its Russian heritage, this incident has been deemed a hate-motivated crime&quot;. Around the same time Calgary police received several other reports related to threats and harassment of Russian Calgarians which they believe are related. An individual has been located and charged with multiple counts of hate-motivated criminal harassment. A representative of the Calgary police stated, &quot;We would like to make it clear that hate-motivated crimes of any kind will not be tolerated in our city.&quot;

====United States====

After friendly relations from the United States&#x27; founding in 1776 to the mid-19th century, Americans&#x27; view of Russia gradually deteriorated by the 1880s because of pogroms as well as the monarchical system. Relations with the Russian Communist government had been highly hostile ever since the Bolshevik coup in 1917 and their subsequent crackdown on all opposition and the state-sponsored Red Terror. The United States recognized the Soviet Union only in 1933 under the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the countries were allies against Germany in World War II.

Relations quickly turned hostile again in 1945–1947, after the war ended, and remained so during the Cold War years. The Soviet Union&#x27;s aggressive and increasingly militaristic foreign policy led to their takeover of Eastern Europe and establishment of a network of satellite states, known as the Soviet Bloc, while totalitarian rule at home was accompanied by political repression and persecution of dissidents. However, Americans often conflated the terms &quot;Russians&quot; and &quot;Communists&quot;/&quot;Soviets&quot;. To stop that in 1973 a group of Russian immigrants in the US founded the Congress of Russian Americans with the purpose of drawing a clear distinction between Russian national identity and Soviet ideology, and preventing the formation of anti-Russian sentiment on the basis of anti-communism. Members of the congress see the conflation itself as Russophobic, believing that &quot;Russians were the first and foremost victim of international Communism&quot;.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the collapse of Communism, anti-Russian sentiment in the United States was at an all-time low. 62% of Americans expressed a positive view of Russia in 1991 and only 25% viewed the country negatively. In 1997, 66% of Americans indicated their friendliness to Russia. However, Russophobia has experienced a resurgence during the late 1990s due to Russia&#x27;s opposition to the enlargement of NATO. According to a Gallup poll, 59% of surveyed Americans viewed Russia negatively in 1999, compared to only 25% in 1991. Still, as relations recovered after the September 11 attacks, and Russia&#x27;s support for the United States, favorability ratings of Russia again rose to 66% in 2002.

In 2013, the formerly majority positive view of Russia among American respondents critically declined and this perception was replaced by a majority negative view of 60% by 2014. By 2019, a record 73% of Americans had a negative opinion of Russia as a country, and formerly dominant positive opinions had fallen from 66% down to 24%. In 2019, the share of Americans considering Russia to be a &quot;critical&quot; threat to national security reached a majority of 52% for the first time.

2001 to Russian reset

In 2005, scholars Ira Straus and Edward Lozansky described negative coverage of Russia in mainstream American media, contrasting sentiment in media coverage with largely positive sentiment of the American public and U.S. government.

The 2008 Russo-Georgian War was one of the recent events that contributed to growth of the negative sentiment toward Russia by the U.S. government. However, in 2011 the majority of American respondents still viewed Russia favorably. According to researchers Oksan Bayulgen and Ekim Arbatli, whose content analysis of the coverage of the events in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; indicated presence of anti-Russian framing bias, people who followed the news more closely had a more negative opinion of Russia than those who rarely followed the conflict. They describe the politicization of foreign policy in the 2008 United States presidential election debates, concurrence of which with the Russo-Georgian War &quot;made Russia a part of the national political conversation&quot;. They also suggest that the links between media, public opinion and foreign policy exist, where U.S. media had an important role in sustaining the Cold War mentality and anti-Russian public sentiment.

End of Russian reset to present

According to surveys by Pew Research Center, favorable views of Russia in the United States started to decrease after reaching their peak in 2011, reducing from 51% to 37% by 2013. In a 2013 survey, 60% of Americans said the United States could not trust Russia. Additionally, 59% of Americans had a negative view of Russia, 23% had a favorable opinion, and 18% were uncertain. According to a survey by Pew Research Center, negative attitudes towards Russia in the United States rose from 43% to 72% from 2013 to 2014.

Whereas in 2006 only 1% of Americans listed Russia as &quot;America&#x27;s worst enemy&quot;, by 2019 32% of Americans, including a plurality of 44% of Democrats, shared this view, with a partisan split having emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign. The sharper distaste among the Democrat population stands in contrast to the prior history of American public opinion on Russia, as Republicans were formerly more likely to view Russia as a greater threat.

In May 2017, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that Russians are &quot;almost genetically driven&quot; to act deviously. Freelance journalist Michael Sainato criticized the remark as xenophobic. In June 2017, Clapper said that &quot;[t]he Russians are not our friends&quot;, because it is in their &quot;genes to be opposed, diametrically opposed, to the United States and Western democracies.&quot; Yuliya Komska in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; took note of a Russiagate-awareness media project featuring Morgan Freeman and James Clapper and wrote that its &quot;hawkish tenor stokes blanket Russophobia that is as questionable as the Russian state media&#x27;s all-out anti-Americanism.&quot;

In June 2020, Russian American professor Nina L. Khrushcheva wrote: &quot;Normally, I would not side with the Kremlin. But I cannot help wondering whether the Russophobia found in some segments of America&#x27;s political class and media has become pathological.&quot; In July 2020, academic and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul spoke about &quot;combatting Russophobia&quot;, appealing to U.S. officials and journalists to cease &quot;demonizing&quot; Russian people, and criticizing propagation of stereotypes about Russians, Russian culture and Russian national proclivities. He, and some other commentators, have argued that the U.S. media does not make enough distinction between Putin&#x27;s government and Russia and the Russians, thus effectively vilifying the whole nation.

On July 2, 2020, the Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump Republicans, released &quot;Fellow Traveler&quot;, an ad saying in Russian with English subtitles that &quot;Comrade Trump&quot; had been &quot;chosen&quot; by Vladimir Putin and had &quot;accepted the help of Mother Russia.&quot; The ad featured communist imagery such as the hammer and sickle, as well as photographs and imagery of Bolshevik dictators Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Mikhail Gorbachev. Eliot Borenstein, Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU, criticized the Lincoln Project&#x27;s &quot;Russophobic&quot; ad, saying: &quot;How would we feel about a two-minute video filled with Stars of David, men in Orthodox garb, sinister snapshots of Bibi, and soldiers in tanks, all to the tune of “Hava Nagila”? If that doesn&#x27;t make you uncomfortable, I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you.&quot;

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; argued in an editorial that the White House blamed Russia for the 2021–2022 inflation surge to deflect criticism of the domestic economic policies.

Hollywood and video games

Russians and Russian Americans are usually portrayed as ruthless agents, brutal mobsters, psychopaths, and villains in Hollywood movies and video games. In a 2014 news story, &quot;Fox News&quot; reported that &quot;Russians may also be unimpressed with Hollywood&#x27;s apparent negative stereotyping of [the Russian people] in movies. &quot;The Avengers&quot; featured a ruthless former KGB agent, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; centers on a rogue Russian scientist with a vendetta, and action thriller &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; saw Kenneth Branagh play an archetypal Russian bad guy, just to name a few. Some games in the critically-acclaimed &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series depict Russians and the Russian Mafia they are supposedly part of as ruthless and heavily-armed enemies which the player has to fight against as part of the storyline, particularly &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; which features a Russian mobster named Dimitri Rascalov as its primary antagonist.

The 2009 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; contains a controversial mission titled &quot;No Russian&quot;, which involves the player engaging in a mass shooting in a Russian airport as part of a terrorist Russian ultranationalist group. This caused blowback, which prompted Activision to remove the mission from the Russian version of the game. In 2019, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare&quot; was criticized by Russian state-owned media and elicited calls for boycott in the country, with Russian gamers voting down the game en masse on Metacritic to blunt its appeal. This was caused by its representation of the Russian Armed Forces, whose soldiers are depicted as occupying the fictional country of Urzikstan (a mash-up of Afghanistan, Chechnya and Syria), where they commit war crimes.

===Pacific===
====New Zealand====
Russophobia in New Zealand dates back to the colonial era; early anti-Russian sentiment among New Zealanders was influenced by &quot;the general Victorian dislike of Tsarist autocracy&quot; and British immigrants to the colony who brought &quot;with them the high level of anti-Russian sentiment at home.&quot; Polish, Hungarian and Jewish refugees fleeing Russia&#x27;s suppression of various rebellions and outbreaks of anti-Jewish pogroms also influenced Russophobia in New Zealand. In the aftermath of the Crimean War, suspicion of a possible Russian invasion of New Zealand led the colonial government to construct a series of &quot;Russian-scare&quot; coastal fortifications along the coastline. However, during the First World War, anti-Russian sentiment subsided as New Zealand and Russia found themselves fighting on the same side against Imperial Germany and anti-German sentiment grew in its place. By late 1920s pragmatism moderated anti-Russian sentiment in official circles, especially during the Great Depression. Influential visitors to the Soviet Union, such as George Bernard Shaw, provided a sympathetic view of what they experienced. The history of Russophobia in New Zealand was analyzed in Glynn Barratt&#x27;s book &quot;Russophobia in New Zealand, 1838–1908&quot;, expanded to cover the period up to 1939 in an article by Tony Wilson.

====Iran====
=====16th–18th centuries =====
Anti-Russian sentiment in Iran dates back centuries. The modern historian Rudi Matthee explains that already by the Safavid period (1501–1736), the Iranians &quot;had long despised Russians for their uncouthness&quot;. Russians enjoyed a bad reputation in Iran, where, by the 17th century, they were known as the Uzbegs of Europe, the worst of all Christians, unmannered, unintelligent and perpetually intoxicated. This perception can be traced back to ancient Greco-Roman cosmographical conceptions which had been conveyed to the Islamic world. According to this concept, the world was divided into seven climes; the farther away the concentric clime from the center, the more barbarian its inhabitants were deemed. The notion was also connected to the old concept of Gog and Magog as found in the Quran, according to which, beyond this boundary lay a murky land inhabited by dimwitted people. Hence, describing this stereotype, in written Safavid sources the denigratory adjective &quot;rus-e manhus&quot; (&quot;inauspicious Russia&quot; or &quot;ominous Russia&quot;) was coined. Over time, it became a generic term for Iranians referring to Russians.

By the mid-17th century, the term &quot;rus-e manhus&quot; designated Cossacks in particular who created havoc around the Caspian littoral, and whom the Iranians did not really distinguish from &quot;real&quot; Russians. By the 18th century, according to Matthee &quot;stereotypes about a primitive people more given to act out of instinct than reason are also likely to have been reinforced by the fact that Iranians, in Jonas Hanway’s words, probably did not see more of “Russians” than tribal, nomadic peoples living around the Caspian Sea, and of “real” Russians at most uncouth soldiers and illiterate fishermen.&quot; However, contemporaneous Iranians were probably no less prone to view Russians as primitive and uncivilized than contemporary English commentators were.

Due to said perceptions, 17th-century Russian envoys were treated with occasional rudeness by the Iranians. Most of the mistreatment of said envoys was however grounded in suspicion and resentment about possible hidden objectives and designs by the Russians. However this was a common global view at the time regarding envoys. Envoys and emissaries were basically invariably seen as having (secret) motives and being spies. In fact, it was this very view that prevented the establishment of permanent diplomatic missions in Europe in the early modern period. Iranian suspicions in the mid-17th century about Russian motives were nevertheless longstanding, ran deep amongst the populace, and were based on genuine concerns.

At the time, the Russians tried to present profitable commercial missions as diplomatic embassies, and covertly tried to support Cossack attacks on Iran. The construction of fortresses in the Caucasus however was the most important factor at the time (see also; Russo-Persian War (1651-1653), with Iranian concerns about Russian plans to subjugate the Caucasus dating back to the mid-16th century. With the rise of the Tsarist realm of Peter the Great and his aggression against Iran in the first half of the 18th century, such concerns were quickly reinvigorated, and were ultimately prophetic in view of the later Russian annexation of the Caucasus in the course of the 19th century.

In the course of the 18th century Iranian views of Russians were somewhat adjusted, due to Peter the Great&#x27;s modernization efforts and expansionism as initiated by Catherine the Great. However, Iranian views of their northern neighbors as being somewhat bland and primitive were apparently never relinquished.

=====19th–21st centuries=====
In his book &quot;Iran at War: Interactions with the Modern World and the Struggle with Imperial Russia&quot;, focusing on the two Russo-Iranian Wars of the first half of the 19th century (1804–1813, 1826–1828), the historian Maziar Behrooz explains that Iranian and Russian elites held a demeaning view of each other prior to the reunification campaigns of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar (1789–1797), as well as through the early 19th century. They viewed each other as uncivilized and backwards, and thus held each other in contempt. For instance, the most commonly used contemporaneous denigratory adjective in Iran for Russians was the aforementioned adjective &quot;rus-e manhus&quot;. The contemporaneous British diplomat, traveller and novelist James Justinian Morier, writing in 1808, noted that the Iranians spoke of Russians with the greatest disdain. As a result of aforementioned wars, Russia annexed large parts of Iranian territory in the Caucasus; With the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede what is present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, eastern Georgia and southern Dagestan to Russia. This fuelled anti-Russian sentiment which led to an angry mob storming the Russian embassy in Tehran and killing everyone in 1829. Among those killed in the massacre was the newly appointed Russian ambassador to Iran, Alexander Griboyedov, a celebrated playwright. Griboyedov had previously played an active role in negotiating the terms of the treaty of 1828.

Soviet involvement in the Azerbaijani and Kurdish separatist movements also fueled negative attitudes. In 2009, negative attitudes to Russia among the Iranian opposition was also observed due to Russian support of the Iranian government. A September 2021 poll done by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland had 42% of Iranian respondents holding an unfavourable view of Russia compared to 56% holding a favourable view.

==== India ====
Russian visitors to Goa make up one of the largest groups in the state and according to Indian media, there has been tension between them and the locals due to violence and other illegal activities committed by some visitors. In February 2012, Indian politician Shantaram Naik accused Russians (as well as Israelis) of occupying certain coastal villages in Goa. In August 2012, Indian politician Eduardo Faleiro rejected the Russian consul general&#x27;s claim that there was no existence of the Russian mafia there, alleging &quot;a virtual cultural invasion&quot; was occurring in Morjim. According to the &quot;Indian Express&quot; in 2013, Goan resentment of foreigners had been building, with anger particularly directed towards Russians and Nigerians.

In 2014, after Goan taxi drivers protested against Russian tour operators allegedly snatching tourist transport services from them, Goa&#x27;s ministry of tourism cancelled an Indo-Russian music festival, sparking criticism from a few Russian diplomats. In 2015, the Russian information centre reportedly said India and Goa &quot;were not considered as good destinations for Russian travellers&quot;.

====Japan====
Many Japanese interactions with Russians as of 2009 occurred with seamen and fishermen of the Russian fishing fleet, therefore some Japanese carried negative stereotypes associated with sailors over to Russians. 

According to a 2012 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, 72% of Japanese people view Russia unfavorably, compared with 22% who viewed it favorably, making Japan the most anti-Russian country surveyed. A 2017 poll from the Japanese government found that 78% of Japanese said they felt little or no affinity to Russia, which was the second highest percentage out of 8 regions polled (behind China at 78.5%).

In December 2016, protesters gathered in Tokyo demanding the return of islands in the Kuril Islands dispute.

Instances of harassment, hate speech and discrimination targeting Russians living in Japan were reported after 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi condemned human rights abuses against Russians that took place.

====Kazakhstan====
According to the Jamestown Foundation, while previously not known for being anti-Russian, Kazakhstan since independence has grown increasingly hostile to both Russia and China. Russian commentator Yaroslav Razumov alleges that &quot;anti-Russian articles are a staple of the Kazakh media&quot;. In 2014, many Kazakhs were enraged with the statement of Russian president Vladimir Putin that &quot;Kazakhs never had any statehood&quot; before independence.

====China====
Tensions between Russia and China began with the Sino-Russian border conflicts, which began in 1652 and lasted until 1689. During the 19th century, when the Qing dynasty of China was distracted suppressing the Taiping Rebellion and fighting the Second Opium War, the Russian government annexed the region of Outer Manchuria through the Unequal Treaties of late imperial China. Russia would continue to sponsor various groups, both pro and anti-Chinese, helping to destabilize China with the Dungan rebellion and Russian occupation of Ili. Towards the collapse of the Qing dynasty, Russia invaded Manchuria and was among a major participant that crushed the Boxer Rebellion against European powers.

With the collapse of the Tsarist Empire in Russia, the Soviet Union was founded. Nonetheless, tensions between the USSR and China remained high. The Soviet Union waged the 1929 war against China, which ended in Soviet victory. The Soviet Union would continue following Imperial Russia&#x27;s expansion of influence by sponsoring a number of various militia groups destabilizing China, especially in Xinjiang which resulted in the Kumul Rebellion, Soviet invasion of Xinjiang and followed by the Islamic rebellion and Ili Rebellion in 1937 and 1944. The Soviet invasion and occupation of Manchuria in 1945 following Japanese control increased anti-Russian and anti-Soviet sentiment as a result of war crimes committed by Soviet troops, including rape and looting.

Nowadays however, anti-Russian sentiment in China has greatly downgraded, due to perceived common anti-Western sentiment among Russian and Chinese nationalists. Ethnic Russians are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==== South Korea ====
A 2020 Gallup International poll had 75% of South Koreans viewing Russia&#x27;s foreign policy as destabilizing to the world, which was the third highest percentage out of 44 countries surveyed. A Morning Consult poll finished on February 6, 2022, had South Korean respondents holding a more unfavorable than favorable impression of Russia by a difference of 25% (the second highest percentage in the Far East). Anti-Russia protests against the country&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine were held in Seoul and Gwangju, with one also planned in Busan.

====Turkey====

According to a 2013 survey, 73% of Turks viewed Russia unfavorably against 16% with favorable views. A 2011 SETA poll had 52% of Turks expressing a negative opinion of Russians compared to 21% expressing a positive opinion. According to a 2012 report, hoteliers in Antalya viewed Russian tourists more negatively than tourists from the West.

Historically, Russia and Turkey fought several wars and had caused great devastation for each nation. During the old Tsardom of Russia, the Ottomans often raided and attacked Russian villagers. With the transformation into Russian Empire, Russia started to expand and clashed heavily with the Turks; which Russia often won more than lost, and reduced the Ottoman Empire heavily. The series of wars had manifested the ideas among the Turks that Russia wanted to turn Turkey into a vassal state, leading to a high level of Russophobia in Turkey. In the 20th century, anti-Russian sentiment in Turkey was so great that the Russians refused to allow a Turkish military attache to accompany their armies. After the World War I, both Ottoman and Russian Empires collapsed, and two nations went on plagued by their civil wars; during that time Soviet Russia (who would later become Soviet Union) supported Turkish Independence Movement led by Mustafa Kemal, leading to a warmer relations between two states, as newly established Turkish Republic maintained a formal tie with the Soviet Union. But their warm relations didn&#x27;t last long; after the World War II, the Bosphorus crisis occurred at 1946 due to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s demand for a complete Soviet control of the straits led to resurgence of Russophobia in Turkey.

Anti-Russian sentiment started to increase again since 2011, following the event of the Syrian Civil War. Russia supports the Government of Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the Free Syrian Army and had many times announced their intentions to overthrow Assad, once again strained the relations. Relations between the two went further downhill after a Russian jet was shot down by a Turkish jet, flaring that Russia wanted to invade Turkey over Assad&#x27;s demand; and different interests in Syria. Turkish media have promoted Russophobic news about Russian ambitions in Syria, and this has been the turning point of remaining poor relations although two nations have tried to re-approach their differences. Turkish military operations in Syria against Russia and Assad-backed forces also damage the relations deeply.

==Business==
On 27 July 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted the analysts as saying that many Western investors still think that anything to do with Russia is &quot;a little bit doubtful and dubious&quot; while others look at Russia in &quot;comic book terms, as mysterious and mafia-run.&quot;

<doc id="1098430" wikidata="Q7869563" url="?curid=1098430" title="USS Galveston (CL-19)">
<text>USS &quot;Galveston&quot; (C-17/PG-31/CL-19) was a protected cruiser in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first Navy ship named for the city of Galveston, Texas.

&quot;Galveston&quot; was laid down 19 January 1901 by William R. Trigg Company, Richmond, Virginia; launched 23 July 1903; sponsored by Miss Ella Sealey; and commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, 15 February 1905.

==Service history==

===1905–1918===
&quot;Galveston&quot; departed Norfolk on 10 April 1905 for Galveston, Texas, where on 19 April she was presented a silver service by citizens of her namesake city. Returning to the East Coast 3 May, she departed New York 18 June for Cherbourg, France, where she arrived 30 June and took part in the ceremonies commemorating the return of the remains of John Paul Jones to the U.S. Naval Academy, reaching Annapolis on 22 July.

She next joined and as one of the host ships for the Russo-Japanese Peace Conference (4–8 August) serving at Oyster Bay, New York; Newport, Rhode Island, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. From 13 August to 11 September 1905 the cruiser had special duty with Minister Plenipotentiary Hollander&#x27;s State Department cruise from Norfolk to the West Indies ports of Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince, followed by preparations for foreign service at Norfolk and New York.

&quot;Galveston&quot; departed Tompkinsville, New York, on 28 December 1905 for service in the Mediterranean with the European Squadron until 28 March 1906 when she set course from Port Said to join the fleet at Cavite in the Philippines for service on the Asiatic Station. She was a part of the fleet reception for Secretary of War William H. Taft at Manila on 13 October 1906 and served in his honor escort to Vladivostok, Siberia, the next month.

&quot;Galveston&quot; spent the following years in cruises among ports of the Philippines, China and Japan. She arrived in San Francisco, California, from the Philippines on 17 February 1910; was decommissioned in the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 21 February; and recommissioned there on 29 June 1912 for service that included a training cruise to Alaska. She left the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 19 September 1913, touching San Francisco, Hawaii and Guam on her way to Cavite, where she joined the Asiatic Fleet on 2 November.

&quot;Galveston&quot;″s tour on the Asiatic Station was largely taken up with convoy service for supply ships and troop transports shuttling Marines and other garrison forces and stores between the Philippines and ports of Japan and China for the protection of American lives, property, and interests with brief intervals of Yangtze River Patrol for the same purpose. She also made one convoy trip from the Philippines to British North Borneo and two trips to Guam in the Marianas. She arrived in San Diego from the Asiatic Station on 10 January 1918 and passed through the Panama Canal on 23 January convoying the British liner acting as a troopship from Cristobal, in the Canal Zone, to Norfolk, and on to New York, arriving on 11 February 1918.

===World War I, 1918===
&quot;Galveston&quot; was assigned to Squadron 2 of the Atlantic Fleet Cruiser Force for convoy escort duties concurrent with the training of Armed Guard crews. After one convoy run through heavy weather from Tompkinsville to Halifax, Nova Scotia, she was largely employed in repeated convoy escort voyages between New York and Norfolk until 22 September 1918 when she departed Tompkinsville with a 19-ship convoy bound for Ponta Delgada, Azores. On the morning of 30 September a convoy straggler was attacked by German submarine . Alerted by the flashing explosion to starboard, &quot;Galveston&quot; headed for the scene of attack and opened fire on the U-boat. Cargo ship was shelled and sunk in the 2-hour battle with a loss of 213 lives and the submarine escaped but the remaining ships of the convoy were brought safely into Ponta Delgada 4 October 1918. &quot;Galveston&quot; returned to Norfolk on 20 October 1918 to resume her coastal convoy escort work until the Armistice.

===1919–1923===
She arrived in Plymouth, England, 26 March 1919; transported a contingent of British-American troops from Harwich to Murmansk, USSR as part of Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War there; then served as flagship of Squadron 3, Patrol Force, in Western European waters. She was largely concerned with the movement of prize crews and repatriation of crews of German ships until 22 June 1919 when she got underway to serve as station and flagship at Constantinople, Turkey. She arrived on station 14 July 1919 and broke the flag of Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol; transported refugees and American Red Cross officials to Constantinople from the Russian ports of Novorossiysk and Theodosia; and carried Rear Admiral Newton A. McCully from Theodosia to Yalta. She was relieved as station ship at Constantinople on 15 July 1920 by cruiser .

With the initial assignment of hull classification symbols and numbers to U.S. Navy ships in 1920, &quot;Galveston&quot; was classified as PG-31. She then returned home by way of Suez Canal and Mediterranean ports reached Boston 17 September 1920, and became a unit of the Special Service Squadron watching over American interests in waters ranging to the Panama Canal and down the West Coast of the Central American States to Corinto, Nicaragua. On 8 August 1921 she was reclassified CL-19. She also intermittently patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico with periodic calls at ports of Florida, Texas, Alabama, and Louisiana. The end of this service was climaxed by a visit to her namesake city in Texas, where she arrived from Panama 26 August 1923 to represent the Navy at the American Legion convention. She then steamed to the Charleston Navy Yard and decommissioned 30 November 1923.

===1924–1930===
&quot;Galveston&quot; was recommissioned 5 February 1924 for duty with the Special Service Squadron. She based most of her operations out of Cristóbal and Balboa, Panama, in a series of patrols that took her off the coast of Honduras, Cuba, and Nicaragua. On 27 August 1926 she arrived at Bluefields, Nicaragua, landing a force of 195 men at the request of the American Consul to protect American interests during a revolutionary uprising. Thereafter much of her time was spent cruising between that-port and Balboa to cooperate with the State Department in the restoration and preservation of order, and to insure the protection of American lives and property in Central America.

After a voyage north in the fall of 1929 for overhaul in the Boston Navy Yard, &quot;Galveston&quot; revisited her namesake 26 to 29 October for the Navy Day celebrations, then touched Cuba on her way to Haiti, where she embarked Marines for transport to the Panama Canal. She resumed her watchful cruises between Balboa and Corinto until 19 May 1930 when she transited the Panama Canal for a last courtesy visit to Galveston (24–31 May) before inactivation overhaul in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

===Decommissioning===
She was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 2 September 1930; struck from the Navy List 1 November 1930, and sold for scrapping 13 September 1933 to the Northern Metal Company of Philadelphia.

<text>USS &quot;Tacoma&quot; (C-18/PG-32/CL-20) was a protected cruiser in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the second Navy ship named after the city of Tacoma, Washington.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tacoma&quot; was laid down on 27 September 1900 at Mare Island, California, by the Union Iron Works. She was launched on 2 June 1903, sponsored by Miss Julia M. Harris, and commissioned on 30 January 1904, Commander Reginald Fairfax Nicholson in command.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
Following a post-commissioning visit to her namesake city, Tacoma, Washington, the protected cruiser voyaged to Hawaii in April and May. She returned to San Francisco on 2 June and, a month later, sailed for Cape Horn. During the voyage, she participated in the search for merchant ship SS &quot;Conemaugh&quot;, which had departed from Valparaíso, Chile, and vanished. After rounding the Horn and steaming up the Atlantic coast of South and North America, &quot;Tacoma&quot; entered New York Harbor on 5 November and remained there until joining the North Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1905.

Following the completion of maneuvers off Culebra Island on 25 January, &quot;Tacoma&quot; sailed for Hispaniola where she performed special duty protecting American interests during one of the many periods of turmoil that have troubled that island. Following that assignment, &quot;Tacoma&quot; conducted target practice off the Florida coast between 27 March and 25 April. She returned to New York on 19 May to prepare for a voyage to Europe.

On 18 June, she sailed for France and arrived at Cherbourg on 30 June. She remained there while a battalion of sailors went to Paris to participate in ceremonies honoring the remains of John Paul Jones which were being returned to the United States. On 8 July, &quot;Tacoma&quot; departed Cherbourg to escort the remains, aboard , to their final resting place at Annapolis, Maryland. After the ceremony at the United States Naval Academy on 24 July, the warship proceeded to Tompkinsville, New York. On 5 August, she embarked Japanese diplomats at New York and transported them to Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s summer home at Oyster Bay, New York. There, they first met the Russian commissioners for the peace negotiations which were later held at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and resulted in the termination of the Russo-Japanese War. &quot;Tacoma&quot; returned to Philadelphia on the 8th and conducted training for the Pennsylvania and Massachusetts naval militias before rejoining the North Atlantic Fleet for operations in the Caribbean Sea.

Deployed to the Mediterranean for the first five months of 1906, the ship visited Tangier, Algiers, Ville-Franche, Naples, and Genoa. After a trip to Grand Canary Island, she returned to the Mediterranean and visited Alexandria and Port Said before returning to the U.S. in June.

For the next ten years, except for an eight-month period in reserve at Philadelphia in 1911 and 1912, &quot;Tacoma&quot; alternated service along the east coast with cruises to the Caribbean and West Indies protecting American citizens and interests there during this turbulent period.

In late 1906 and early 1907, Cuba was the major trouble spot; and the cruiser operated along her coasts from late September until mid-November and again from late December until June, visiting Havana, Tunas, Manzanilla, Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos, and Guantanamo Bay. She returned to the West Indies again in the spring of 1908 for stops at St. Thomas, St. Christopher, Martinique, Margarita Island, Port Mochima, Cunamá, La Guaira, and Curaçao. During the second half of 1908 and the first half of 1909, she observed political conditions in Haiti and Honduras. From July to September 1909, the cruiser operated of Nicaragua. Later, her itinerary included a visit to Costa Rica and a return to Honduras, all in an effort to bring the steadying influence of American military power to the volatile Latin American republics.

Between January and March 1910, &quot;Tacoma&quot; cruised off the coast of Nicaragua and visited the Canal Zone and Costa Rica. After a spring voyage to the east coast of the United States, the ship headed back to Central America to protect United States interests there. During the following nine months, she visited Panama, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. In January 1911, pursuant to the orders of the senior naval officer present embarked in the gunboat , &quot;Tacoma&quot; prevented the converted yacht &quot;Hornet&quot; from participating in an insurrection against the government financed by U.S. banana baron Samuel Zemurray. Later that month, she landed a force of marines at Puerto Cortés, Honduras, to protect American banana companies. Negotiations were held aboard which resulted in Francisco Bertrand being named interim President of Honduras. In February, her deck was the scene of a peace conference conducted by special commissioner T. C. Dawson. The negotiations brought the revolution to a close and established a new provisional government in Honduras. That summer, &quot;Tacoma&quot; steamed – via Puerto Mexico and Galveston – to New York. She remained at the New York Navy Yard until mid-November when she went into reserve at Philadelphia.

In July 1912, &quot;Tacoma&quot; came out of reserve and was soon on her way back to the troubled waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Late that month, a revolution broke out in Nicaragua and lasted until November. The cruiser patrolled almost incessantly off the Nicaraguan coast at Bluefields and at Great Corn Island from 3 August to 25 October. In November, she headed – via Tampico, Mexico, and Galveston, Texas – for the Navy Yard at Boston where she remained through mid-February 1913. By the 22nd, she was back patrolling and observing, this time along the coasts of Honduras and Guatemala. The ship returned to New York in July; then operated off the Mexican coast. She cruised off Tampico and Vera Cruz until January 1914 when she returned to the east coast of the U.S. for repairs.

&quot;Tacoma&quot; resumed operations in Mexican waters early in May in the wake of the Tampico Incident and the resultant seizure of the customs house at Vera Cruz. The warship cruised the Mexican coast through September during the latter stages of the Huerta-Carranza struggle and while the new Carranza government consolidated its power against former allies, notably Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.

Late in September 1914, &quot;Tacoma&quot; departed the Mexican coast; steamed, via Jamaica and Cuba, to Haiti, and patrolled off Cape Haitien until early December. After a visit to the Canal Zone, the cruiser returned to Haiti in February; then moved to Santo Domingo in March. On 21 March, she entered the Portsmouth (N.H.) Navy Yard for repairs.

While at Portsmouth, &quot;Tacoma&quot; was placed in reserve. On 19 May 1916, she shifted to Boston, Massachusetts, where she served as receiving ship. On 1 December, she again was placed in full commission. She made another voyage to Mexican waters for patrol duty from January to April 1917.

===World War I===
Upon U.S. entry into World War I, &quot;Tacoma&quot; returned to the Atlantic seaboard to prepare for convoy duty. During the war, she made five round trips to Europe protecting troop and supply convoys. While returning to the U.S. from her third voyage to Europe, she stopped at Halifax, Nova Scotia, just after the French munitions ship, exploded on 6 December 1917 and severely damaged the city in the Halifax Explosion. &quot;Tacoma&quot; assisted in relief work; and, for eight days, the cruiser&#x27;s officers and men worked diligently to help the devastated port community.

===Post-war===

At the end of the war, the cruiser joined the Pacific Squadron and served with it until 1920. Early that year, she returned to her old duty of encouraging stability in the perennially volatile Caribbean. As a unit of the Special Service Squadron, which was ordered to observe events in Latin America and the Caribbean and to protect American interests in those areas, &quot;Tacoma&quot; patrolled the isthmian coast until January 1924. During that time, she was redesignated a light cruiser, CL-20.

During a heavy storm on 16 January, the warship ran aground on Blanquilla Reef near Veracruz. For almost a week, her crew tried without success to free her, her captain and three crewmen–Captain Herbert G. Sparrow, Radioman Second Class Edward Thaxter Herrick, Radioman First Class Homer Harry Lussier, and Radioman Third Class Solomon Sivin–drowning in those attempts. After a board of inquiry, the Navy struck her name from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 February 1924. She was sold to R. Sebastian of the American Consulate at Veracruz on 5 September 1924.

==Legacy==
The original ship&#x27;s bell from the &quot;Tacoma&quot;, is currently on display at the War Memorial Park in Tacoma, Washington.

<text>Jimbolia (; ; ; ; Banat Bulgarian: &quot;Džimbolj&quot;) is a town in Timiș County, Romania. 

== Geography ==
Jimbolia is located in the west of Timiș County, from the county seat, Timișoara, which is connected by the county road DJ59A and the Kikinda–Jimbolia–Timișoara railway. It lies in the Banat Plain, at the contact between the Timiș Plain and the Mureș Plain. An alignment of villages marks the boundary between the two relief units: Checea–Cărpiniș–Satchinez. The average altitude of the town is . It is located at the intersection of some roads that connect Romania and Serbia, being also a rail and road border point at the frontier between the two countries.

Jimbolia&#x27;s climate is characterized by average temperatures of and average rainfall of per year. The vegetation consists of steppe meadows largely replaced by agricultural crops. The soils are very fertile and belong to the category of chernozems.
== Administration ==

The current local council has the following political composition, based on the results of the votes cast at the 2024 Romanian local elections.

== History ==
=== Medieval period ===
The ancient history of the town began to be documented in 1332–1333, when a papal census of the lands of Banat for the establishment of taxes (tithe) took place. In these papal registers, the name &quot;Chumbul&quot; appears. From the researches of Hungarian historian , it appears that originally it was a Cumano-Vlach locality, a fact proved by the existence of a Romanian parish. This &quot;Chumbul&quot; is also mentioned in Hungarian documents from 1489, which speak of the existence of the communes of &quot;Chumbul Mare&quot; (&quot;Great Chumbul&quot;), &quot;Chumbul Mic&quot; (&quot;Little Chumbul&quot;) and &quot;Chumbul Intern&quot; (&quot;Inner Chumbul&quot;), most likely owned by the Csomboly family. The last document from this period, recorded by historian , shows that in 1520 there was a certain Mihai of &quot;Chumbul&quot;, a close man of the king. After this appearance in documents from the beginning of the Middle Ages, nothing is said about this locality in documents from the Turkish rule of Banat.

=== Re-establishment and colonization ===

The historical thread is resumed after the conquest of Banat by the Austrians, but for a period it does not appear to be inhabited. Only in 1766 was the new town born, by colonization with German population from Mainz, Trier, Sauer, Pfalz, Lorraine, and Luxembourg. It originally consisted of two separate areas, &quot;Landestreu&quot; and &quot;Hatzfeld&quot;, a little further west, but two years later the two merged under the name &quot;Hatzfeld&quot;, a name given in honor of Empress Maria Theresa&#x27;s prime minister, Carl Friedrich Hatzfeldt zu Gleichen (1718–1793). The conditions to which the first settlers were subjected were particularly harsh: because of the swamps surrounding the settlement and the unsanitary conditions, 168 people died in the first year of establishment alone. A plague epidemic ensued in 1770 that killed no less than 553 people. In 1781 &quot;Hatzfeld&quot; was leased to , then sold to him. Later, the began to colonize the town with Hungarians.

=== Modern period ===
After the 1848–1849 revolution, the region became part of the Austrian Crown Land of the Serbian Voivodeship and Temeswarer Banat. Jimbolia began to develop in the second half of the 19th century, with the rise of industrialization that swept all of Banat. In 1857, the railway between Timișoara and Kikinda was completed, which also passed through Jimbolia and connected further with Szeged, being the main route from Timișoara to Budapest and Vienna. Access to this railway allowed it to develop rapidly, slowed only by the cholera epidemic of 1873, which killed more than 1,000 people. During this period, the brick factory (1864) opened, attracting agricultural workers from all over southern Banat, especially Hungarians. Thus was born the &quot;Futok&quot; district (of the &quot;fugitives&quot;, from the name given to the Hungarians fleeing from the agricultural estates).

In 1861, Emperor Franz Joseph I decreed the renewed validity of the Hungarian state constitution (Austro-Hungarian Compromise), whereby the town once again belonged to the Hungarian part of the country, as it had before 1848. Under Hungarian administration, more and more Hungarians moved to the town, which was officially called &quot;Zsombolya&quot; from 1899. 

In 1895 the Jimbolia–Ionel railway was put into use. In 1906, the railway from Jimbolia to Grabaț, Lenauheim and Lovrin was completed, built with the help of workers from Țara Moților, some of whom settled in the south of the town. At the turn of the century, Jimbolia was three-quarters German and one-quarter Hungarian, with only a few Romanians and Serbs.

=== Disputed by Romania and Serbia ===
World War I radically changed the configuration of the area within which Jimbolia played a central role. From an important town in the economy of Banat, it becomes a border town. After the withdrawal of the Serbs from Timișoara and the unification of Banat with Romania, Jimbolia remained in the provisional borders of Serbia. At the Paris Peace Conference, Prime Minister Ion I.C. Brătianu demanded the recognition of the borders of a Romania that included the whole of Banat, with the border on the lower Tisa until its discharge into the Danube and then the course of the Danube. However, the conference decided on the demarcation line that has been maintained until today, except for a rectification that took place in 1923. On 24 November 1923, Romania and Serbia concluded a protocol for a territorial exchange in Belgrade. Romania undertook to cede the communes of Pardanj, Modoš, Šurjan, Crivobara and Veliki Gaj, while Serbia ceded to Romania Beba Veche, Cherestur, Ciorda, Iam and the town of Jimbolia. The latter officially became part of Romania only in 1924.

=== Contemporary period ===
After World War II, Jimbolia entered a new stage of development in the planned economy. In 1950 it was declared a town, then the block of flats in the station area began to be built, new industries were introduced and existing ones were developed. At the same time, the irreversible process of declining German population begins, which within a few decades becomes a minority and ends with the mass exodus after the 1989 revolution.

== Demographics ==


Jimbolia had a population of 10,808 inhabitants at the 2011 census, down 3% from the 2002 census. Most inhabitants were Romanians (72.69%), larger minorities being represented by Hungarians (10.82%), Roma (5.51%) and Germans (2.87%). For 7.29% of the population, ethnicity was unknown. By religion, most inhabitants were Orthodox (62.57%), but there were also minorities of Roman Catholics (22.98%) and Pentecostals (4.03%). For 7.39% of the population, religious affiliation was unknown.

At the 2021 census, the town had a population of 10,179; of those, 71.54% were Romanians, 6.1% Roma, 6.08% Hungarians, and 1.48% Germans.
== Culture ==

In recent years, the town is experiencing a cultural revival, benefiting from very active cultural institutions: the House of Culture, six museums, a literary café and a town library. 

The most prestigious of them is the Romanian-German Cultural Foundation founded by Romanian poet Petre Stoica, with numerous national and international awards. With the main purpose of reconstituting the Romanian and German cultural and spiritual life in Banat, the foundation has in its inventory a library of 16,000 volumes in Romanian and German, some with great bibliophilic value, a collection of numismatics, philately, stamps and bookplates, important manuscripts from Romanian and German writers, paintings, engravings, and museum household objects.

== Education ==
In the town there are five kindergartens for preschool children, a general school (1–8) where over 1,000 students study and a school group for 1,200 students. 

The Technological High School in Jimbolia has theoretical and technological classes, vocational school, night courses and post-secondary courses. Following an investment from the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, the high school offers high schooling conditions, with modern laboratories of computer science, mechanics, electrical engineering, electronics, farm equipment repair and maintenance, welding and hydraulic-pneumatics.

== Healthcare ==
Medical services are provided by five private medical offices, four private dental offices and a town hospital with a capacity of 125 beds.

== Economy ==
From an economic point of view, the primary sector, agriculture, has a significant share. The land fund comprises of agricultural land, of which 97% is arable land and 3% are grasslands and hayfields.

The industrial profile of the town remains dominated by the light industry (footwear, clothing, textiles), followed by electrical and electronic engineering industries, mechanical industry and plastics industry. 58% of the active population works in the town&#x27;s industry. The largest industrial companies in the town are: Vogt (electronic components), Ciocanul Prodimpex (footwear), CRH (car subassemblies), Halm (hydraulic pumps), Ani Fashion (clothing), Faulhaber (micromotors) and Kabelsysteme Hatzfeld (audio-video cables).

The tertiary sector, which covers the full range of services, has a share of 38%.

<doc id="1098453" wikidata="Q1196132" url="?curid=1098453" title="Lake Towada">
<text>is the largest crater lake in Honshū island, Japan. Located on the border between Aomori and Akita prefectures, it lies 400 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level and is 327 m (1,073 ft) deep, drained by the Oirase River. With a surface area of , Towada is Japan&#x27;s 12th largest lake; its bright blue color is due to its great depth. The lake is roughly circular, with two peninsulas extending from its southern shore approximately one-third into the center of the lake. The lake is a popular tourist destination.

==Location==
Lake Towada is located approximately northeast of Tokyo, divided between the municipalities of Towada, Aomori and Kosaka, Akita. It forms part of the northern section of Towada-Hachimantai National Park

==Geology==
Lake Towada occupies the caldera of a stratovolcano still regarded as active. This volcano became active around 200,000 years ago, and through repeated eruptions and pyroclastic flows, especially 55,000 and 36,000 and 15,000 years ago, created an caldera with the proto-Lake-Towada. From approximately 15,000 to 12,000 years ago, intermittent eruptions formed a small stratovolcano within this caldera (Mount Goshikiiwa). Intermediate eruptive activity continued, and at least eight eruptions of magma occurred from 11,000 years ago to the present. The Ogurayama Lava Dome was formed approximately 7,600 years ago on the northeastern slope of the Goshikiiwa volcano. The Mikadoishi Lava Dome is estimated to have emerged between 12,000 and 2,800 years ago. The collapse of these secondary lava domes approximately 5400 years ago give the lake its distinct shape, and the inlet between its two peninsulas (called the &quot;Nakaumi&quot;) is the remnant of a secondary caldera which erupted and collapsed.

==Hydrology==
According to the National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan, the water renewal cycle of Lake Towada is approximately 8.5 years. The catchment area of the lake covers an area of . The lake area is fed by around seventy rivers, half of which are intermittent. The Oirase River, which drains towards the Pacific Ocean, is the only outlet.

==History==
The name of the lake is believed to derive from the Ainu word , literally meaning &quot;rocky lake&quot;.

According to a legendary account, the Yamata general Sakanoue Tamuramaro visited Lake Towada during one of his expeditions north to conquer the Emishi tribes and built a small Shinto shrine on the eastern shore of the Nakayama peninsula in 807 AD dedicated to Yamato Takeru. The mountain continued to erupt well into the historical period, with the last recorded eruption occurring in 915 AD in the Nakaumi caldera, devastating the surrounding area with pyroclastic flows and lahars and covering most of the Tōhoku region of Japan with volcanic ash, leading to crop failures, climate change, and famines.

During the Heian and Kamakura Period, the area was a wilderness and a place of prayer and training for Yamabushi, including worship of Suijin, the &quot;kami&quot; of water, as being associated with the azure dragon, legendary guardian of the lake, hence the other name of the sanctuary: Towadasan Seiryū daigongen.

The area around Lake Towada remained largely wilderness until towards the end of the Edo period, when the Nambu clan of Morioka Domain attempted large-scale land reclamation projects at Sanbongihara (modern Towada) using the Oirase River for irrigation. In 1903, largely through the efforts of Wainai Sadayuki, princess trout were introduced into Lake Towada. The lake now also has rainbow trout, cherry salmon, carp, Carassius, and Japanese eel. The surrounding forests are temperate-deciduous and are primarily Erman’s birch and Siebold’s beech.

The lake was selected by the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun and Osaka Mainichi Shimbun as one of the Eight Scenic Views of Japan in 1927. In 1936, the lake and surrounding areas became part of Towada-Hachimantai National Park.

In 1953, in order to popularize the lake and the park, a sculpture of two women titled &quot;The Maiden Statue&quot; by Kōtarō Takamura was dedicated at the lakeshore as part of the park&#x27;s 15th anniversary celebration. It was the last work by that sculptor.

A wartime Tachikawa Ki-54 aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force which crashed in 1943 was found at the bottom of Lake Towada on 13 August 2010. It was recovered on 5 September 2012 and was placed on display at the Misawa Aviation &amp; Science Museum before being transferred in 2020 for a proposed restoration to , the successor to the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer, the Tachikawa Aircraft Company.

==Activities==
The lake&#x27;s symbol, the Otome-no-Zo statue, is located in the central area of Yasumiya. From there excursion boats arrive and depart. In Utarube, visitors can canoe or camp.

<text>The is a river located in eastern Aomori Prefecture, in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan.

The Oirase River is the only river that drains Lake Towada, a large caldera lake that lies on the border of Aomori and Akita Prefectures. The river flows in a generally eastern direction, through the municipalities of Towada, Rokunohe, Oirase, and Hachinohe before exiting into the Pacific Ocean. The upper reaches of the river form a scenic gorge with numerous rapids and waterfalls, and is one of the major tourist attractions of the Towada-Hachimantai National Park. The lower reaches of the river are used extensively for irrigation.

In 1996 the sound of flowing water at the Oirase River was selected by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan.

<text>Bruce Grove is a station on the Weaver line of the London Overground, located in central Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey, north London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and stations. Its three-letter station code is BCV and it is in Travelcard zone 3.
==History==

Bruce Grove was originally a stop on the Stoke Newington &amp; Edmonton Railway and opened on 22 July 1872. Today it is on the Seven Sisters branch of the Lea Valley lines and sees four Weaver line trains per hour to Liverpool Street and two to either or . The station is not far from Bruce Castle and takes its name from a road forming part of the A10.

In the early 1980s several changes were made to the appearance of the station. The wooden covered staircases to both platforms were replaced by open-air concrete staircases. The London-bound platform roof was shortened and the waiting rooms boarded up. The northbound roof opposite (which was identical) was completely removed and a small shelter built of brick was installed in its place. This shelter lasted for nearly 20 years before it was demolished and a new roof, built in the style of the original, although much shorter, was constructed giving the illusion of original authenticity to the station. Haringey council funded the work and the station is considered a site of historic interest in the locality.

In May 2015 the station and all services that call there transferred from Abellio Greater Anglia to become part of the London Overground network. In November 2015 a major facelift for the station was announced.

In 2023 restoration work on the disused waiting rooms was completed, creating a new waiting room and a community space.

==Services==
All services at Bruce Grove are operated as part of the Weaver line of the London Overground using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to London Liverpool Street
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 123, 149, 243, 259, 279, 318, 341, 349, 476 and W4 and night routes N279 serve the station.

<text>Mioveni () is a town in Argeș County, Romania, approximately north-east of Pitești. , it had a population of 29,317. The town administers four villages: Clucereasa, Colibași, Făgetu, and Racovița.

== History ==
Mioveni was first mentioned in a written record in 1485. It developed much in the 1970s after the construction of the Automobile Dacia manufacturing plant, inaugurated in 1968. There is also a Nuclear Research Institute, that builds components and materials for the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant, and a high security prison.

It officially became a town in 1989, as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program. Prior to April 1989, when it was declared a town, the place was a commune under the name of &quot;Colibași&quot;. In 1996, the historic name of Mioveni was revived, although the old village had been completely razed under the Communist regime in order to make way for new urban construction.

== Economy ==
Automobile Dacia is headquartered in the town. The company&#x27;s single plant here has a production capacity of 350,000 vehicles per year.

==Sports==
Its football team, CS Mioveni (formerly &quot;Dacia Mioveni&quot;) has played four seasons in the Romanian first league: in 2007–08, 2011–12, 2021–22 and 2022–23. They also reached the semifinals of the 2007–08 Romanian Cup. 

Stadionul Orășenesc (which opened in 2000) is the home ground for the Mioveni team.

<text>&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; is the eighth single by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 14 March 1983. 

The song was released as a stand-alone single and became the band&#x27;s first UK number one record. It debuted in the number one position on the UK Singles Chart on 26 March 1983. The single also had great success in America, where it was released in late May. The song reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 6 August 1983 and sold more than a million copies.

==Recording==
&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; was recorded at Tony Visconti’s Good Earth Studios in Soho, London with producer Ian Little, who was recommended to the group by Roxy Music’s Phil Manzanera. Eventually, the song would undergo several rounds of mixing due to a lack of compression on the drums as Little asserted: one mix was done at Good Earth, one at Eel Pie Studios, one at the Gallery and one at the Power Station in New York with Bob Clearmountain. Keyboardist Nick Rhodes remembered being present most of the night during the mix with Clearmountain and leaving the next day thinking the band had something special on their hands. But upon reflection some days later, it was decided that despite being what they considered a &quot;beautiful mix&quot;, it was a little too soft for the sound they were trying to achieve for the record. So the final mix would be done with producer Alex Sadkin (who&#x27;d be brought in to produce the band&#x27;s next album alongside Little, &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;) and Phil Thornalley at RAK Studios, London, who replaced the drums with samples triggered via AMS delay units. According to Rhodes, the pulsing keyboard sound is from a Roland Jupiter-8 synth, while the Prophet-5 was used for a small melodic part.

==Critical reception==
In its contemporary review of the song, &quot;Cash Box&quot; praised &quot;the upbeat arrangement, clear production and lustrous vocals.&quot; David Hepworth of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; just noticed that producer change lead to &quot;more pronounced &quot;rock group&quot; sound&quot; and expressed displeasure with impossibility to do something &quot;with an overly-strained chorus.&quot; In a retrospective review of the song, AllMusic journalist Donald A. Guarisco wrote that the lyrics &quot;deal with a difficult romantic relationship in rather obtuse terms.&quot; Guarisco highlighted what he described as &quot;odd turns of phrase&quot; in the lyrics, such as: &quot;and fiery demons all dance when you walk through that door/Don&#x27;t say you&#x27;re easy on me &#x27;cause you&#x27;re about as easy as a nuclear war.&quot;

Although Guarisco questioned the lyrics, he praised the melody in the song. He wrote: &quot;The melody of &#x27;Is There Something I Should Know?&#x27; is one of Duran Duran&#x27;s catchiest, matching twisty verse melodies full of ear-catching hooks with a harmonized chorus.&quot;

==Music video==
The video for &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; featured colour clips of the band members, in blue shirts with tucked-in white ties, interspersed with surreal images in black-and-white. The video made a point of marking the transition between the first three albums, featuring clips from several earlier Duran Duran videos. This included &quot;My Own Way&quot;—presented on the &quot;Duran Duran&quot; video album but never released to MTV.

The video was directed by Russell Mulcahy, and was one of the most popular videos of 1983 on MTV. The video is longer as there are verses that were edited out of the original 45 release, that subsequently made it to album, tape and CD. The DVD Greatest Hits has the long version video

When asked if there was anything about their videos they would like to change, drummer Roger Taylor commented, &quot;The only part of a video I would change is the end of &#x27;Is There Something I Should Know?&#x27; where I am singing to the camera. I look very uncomfortable doing this and cringe every time I see it to this day.&quot;

==B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes==
The B-side to &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; in the UK is the instrumental &quot;Faith in This Colour&quot;. An &quot;alternate slow mix&quot; of &quot;Faith in This Colour&quot; was used on the 7&quot; single, some pressings of which included brief unauthorized sound samples from the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot;—these were promptly withdrawn when copyright concerns were raised, although on the &quot;alternate slow mix&quot; from the singles box set, the scene, in which Obi-Wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, can clearly be heard in the last minute.

The mainly instrumental &quot;Monster mix&quot; of &quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; was completed by producers Ian Little and Alex Sadkin and Phil Thornalley at RAK studio One.

In the US, the song &quot;Careless Memories&quot; was used as the B-side.

==Covers, samples and media references==

The band Sugar Ray took elements from the video and featured them in a segment of the music video for their single &quot;When It&#x27;s Over&quot;.

Cover versions of the song have been recorded by the Mr. T Experience, Harvey Danger and Allstars, the last of which took the song back into the UK charts at #12 in September 2001 as a double-A-side with their own track &quot;Things That Go Bump in the Night&quot;.

The second episode of the sixth season of the cartoon series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, entitled &quot;Maybe No Go&quot;, follows Billy Quizboy and Pete White retrieving the rubber ball prop used in the music video from their archenemy, a collector of pop culture memorabillia.

The line &quot;you&#x27;re about as easy as a nuclear war&quot; was the inspiration for the Duran Duran song &quot;Yo Bad Azizi&quot;, included as a B-side to the &quot;Serious&quot; single released seven years later.

<doc id="1098521" wikidata="Q1680164" url="?curid=1098521" title="James Clarence Mangan">
<text>James Clarence Mangan, born James Mangan (; 1 May 1803 – 20 June 1849), was an Irish poet. He freely translated works from German, Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Irish, with his translations of Goethe gaining special interest. Starting around 1840, and with increasing frequency after the Great Famine began, he wrote patriotic poems, such as &quot;A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century&quot;. Mangan was troubled, eccentric, and an alcoholic. He died early from cholera, amid the continuing dire conditions of the Famine. After his death, Mangan was hailed as Ireland&#x27;s first national poet and admired by writers such as James Joyce and William Butler Yeats.

==Early life==
Mangan was born at Fishamble Street, Dublin, the son of James Mangan, a former hedge school teacher and native of Shanagolden, County Limerick, and Catherine Smith from Kiltale, County Meath. After marrying Smith, James Mangan took over a grocery business in Dublin owned by the Smith family, eventually becoming bankrupt as a result. 

Mangan described his father as having &quot;a princely soul but no prudence&quot;, and attributed his family&#x27;s bankruptcy to his father&#x27;s suspect business speculations and tendency to throw expensive parties. Thanks to poor record keeping, inconsistent biographies, and his own semi-fictional and sensationalized autobiographical accounts, Mangan&#x27;s early years are the subject of much speculation. However, despite the popular image of Mangan as a long-suffering, poor poet, there is reason to believe that his early years were spent in relative middle-class comfort.

He was educated at a Jesuit school where he learned Latin, Spanish, French, and Italian. He attended three schools before the age of fifteen. Obliged to find a job in order to support his family, for seven years he was a scrivener&#x27;s clerk and for three years earned meagre wages in an attorney&#x27;s office, and was later an employee of the Ordnance Survey and an assistant in the library of Trinity College, Dublin.

==Literary career==
Mangan&#x27;s first verses were published in 1818. From 1820 he adopted the middle name Clarence. In 1830 he began producing translations – generally free interpretations rather than strict transliterations – from German, a language he had taught himself. Of interest are his translations of Goethe. From 1834 his contributions began appearing in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;. In 1840 he began producing translations from Turkish poetry, Persian poetry, Arabic poetry, and Irish poetry. He was also known for literary hoaxes; some of his &quot;translations&quot; are in fact works of his own, like &quot;Twenty Golden Years Ago&quot;, attributed to a certain Selber. His connection with &quot;The Dublin University Magazine&quot; was terminated because his habits rendered him incapable of regular application.

He was friends with the patriotic journalists Thomas Davis, and John Mitchel, who would write his biography. His poems were published in their newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;. Mangan was for a time paid a fixed salary, but, as on former occasions, these relations were broken off, though he continued to send verses to &quot;The Nation&quot; even after he had cast in his lot with Mitchel, who in 1848 began to issue &quot;The United Irishman&quot;.

Although his early poetry was often apolitical, after the Famine he began writing patriotic poems, including influential works such as &quot;Dark Rosaleen&quot;, a translation of &quot;Róisín Dubh&quot; and &quot;A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century&quot;. 
His best-known poems include &quot;Dark Rosaleen&quot;, &quot;Siberia&quot;, &quot;Nameless One&quot;, &quot;A Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century&quot;, &quot;The Funerals&quot;, &quot;To the Ruins of Donegal Castle&quot;, &quot;Pleasant Prospects for the Land-eaters&quot; and &quot;Woman of Three Cows&quot;. He wrote a brief autobiography, on the advice of his friend Charles Patrick Meehan, which ends mid-sentence. This must have been written in the last months of his life, since he mentions his narrative poem of the Italian Gasparo Bandollo, which was published in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; in May 1849.

Mangan was a lonely and often difficult man who suffered from mood swings, depression and irrational fears, and became a heavy drinker and opium user. There are many descriptions of his personal appearance at this time, all of them dwelling on his spare figure, his tight blue cloak, his witch&#x27;s hat, and his inevitable umbrella. He was described by the artist William Frederick Wakeman as frequently wearing &quot;a huge pair of green spectacles&quot;, padded shirts to hide his malnourished figure, and a hat which &quot;resembled those which broomstick-riding witches are usually represented with&quot;. In 1849, weakened by poverty, alcoholism and malnutrition, he succumbed to cholera aged only 46. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

== Style ==
Mangan&#x27;s poetry fits into a variety of literary traditions. Most obviously, and frequently, his work is read alongside such nationalist political authors as John Mitchel, as they appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Vindicator&quot; and the &quot;United Irishman&quot; newspapers; or as a manifestation of the 19th-century Irish Cultural Revival. It is hard not to acknowledge Mangan&#x27;s debts to such translators and collectors of traditional Irish poetry as Samuel Ferguson and James Hardiman; many of Mangan&#x27;s poems, for instance &quot;Dark Roseleen&quot;, appear to be adaptations of earlier translations rather than original translations.

Mangan is also frequently read as a Romantic poet. In particular, he is compared to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas De Quincey, largely thanks to his rumoured opium addiction and tendency to place his writing within the frame of a vision or dream.

More recently, critics have begun to read Mangan&#x27;s work as a precursor to modernist and postmodernist experimental writing. His playful literary hoaxes and fake translations (which he called &quot;reverse plagiarism&quot;) have been seen as a precursor to the works of Flann O&#x27;Brien.

== Reception and legacy ==
During his life and immediately after, Mangan&#x27;s legacy was co-opted by Irish nationalism, primarily thanks to John Mitchel&#x27;s biography of Mangan, which stressed that Mangan was &quot;a rebel with his whole heart and soul against the whole British spirit&quot;. Naturally, this helped to propel Mangan&#x27;s legacy as Ireland&#x27;s first national poet, and to lead later Irish writers to look back at his work.

James Joyce wrote two essays on Mangan, the first in 1902 and the second in 1907 and also used his name in his works, for instance in &quot;Araby&quot; in &quot;Dubliners&quot;. Joyce wrote that in Mangan&#x27;s poetry &quot;images interweave [their] soft, luminous scarves and words ring like brilliant mail, and whether the song is of Ireland or of Istambol it has the same refrain, a prayer that peace may come again to her who has lost peace, the moonwhite pearl of his soul&quot;. Joyce also described Mangan as &quot;a prototype for a would-be-nation&quot;, but stressed that he was ultimately a &quot;feeble figure&quot; that fell short of such promise.

WB Yeats considered Mangan one of the best Irish poets, along with Thomas Davis and Samuel Ferguson, writing &quot;To the soul of Clarence Mangan was tied the burning ribbon of Genius.&quot;

Among the contemporary Irish writers he has influenced are Thomas Kinsella; Michael Smith; James McCabe, who wrote a sensationally discovered continuation of Mangan&#x27;s autobiography that appeared in the Dublin journal &quot;Metre&quot; in 2001, but was later revealed – in a Mangan-style hoax – to be written by McCabe rather than Mangan; and David Wheatley, author of a sonnet sequence on Mangan. He is also cited by songwriter Shane MacGowan as an inspiration for both his work and his lifestyle. McGowan&#x27;s song &quot;The Snake with Eyes of Garnet&quot; features Mangan as a character:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Last night as I lay dreaming&quot;
&quot;My way across the sea&quot;
&quot;James Mangan brought me comfort&quot;
&quot;With laudanum and poitin…&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
A 1979 novel by Northern Irish/Canadian novelist Brian Moore, &quot;The Mangan Inheritance&quot;, tells the story of (fictional) young American James Mangan traveling to Ireland to find whether he is descended from the poet.

While Mangan still is not held in the same esteem by critics as Joyce or Yeats, more recent literary criticism has begun to seriously consider his work. Largely, this can be attributed to the publication of David Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Nationalism and Minor Literature: James Clarence Mangan and the Emergence of Irish Cultural Nationalism&quot; in 1987. Lloyd&#x27;s work was the first to seriously attempt to untangle Mangan the man from the nationalist poet fostered by John Mitchel.

Private papers of Mangan are held in the National Library of Ireland, the Royal Irish Academy, and the archives of Trinity College, Dublin.

<doc id="1098536" wikidata="Q4768592" url="?curid=1098536" title="Anne Manning (novelist)">
<text>Anne Manning (17 February 1807 – 14 September 1879) was an English novelist. Born in London, she was an active writer, having 51 works to her credit. Though her writings were antiquated in style, they were considered to have some literary charm and a delicate historical imagination. Her best known novel features the young wife of the poet John Milton.

==Background and life==
Manning initially produced two books of non-fiction, followed by her first fictional work, &quot;Village Belles&quot; (first published in 1833, though some modern sources mistakenly say 1838). Her best known works were initially printed as serials in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and later published in book form. She is best known for &quot;The Maiden and Married Life of Mary Powell, afterwards Mistress Milton&quot;, which first appeared anonymously in 1849 and was later just referred to as &quot;Mary Powell&quot;. It is derived from the story of the young wife of John Milton. She is also known for &quot;The Household of Sir Thomas More&quot;, a picture of More&#x27;s home life in the form of a diary written by his daughter Margaret.

&quot;Mary Powell&quot; was so popular that her subsequent works simply identified Manning as &quot;The Author of Mary Powell,&quot; otherwise remaining anonymous. A number of sources subsequently attributed the pseudonym of &quot;Mary Powell&quot; to Hannah Mary Rathbone, whose &quot;The Diary of Lady Willoughby&quot; (1844) was similar in style to Manning, and erroneously suggested that Manning had at some point married and become Mrs. Rathbone. Manning and Rathbone both released a number of works which used Caslon Old Face font, to add a visual element to the notion that their works were actual diaries of long ago persons.

Manning never married, and was considered a chronic invalid, living for many years at Reigate Hill in Surrey until her mother died, and then at a sister&#x27;s house near Tunbridge Wells, where she died in 1879.

Although inexpensive reprints of &quot;Mary Powell&quot; and &quot;The Household of Sir Thomas More&quot; were published into the 1930s, Manning&#x27;s archaic style has long since fallen out of favor.

==Selected bibliography==
Manning wrote over 50 books. They include:

<doc id="1098538" wikidata="Q1770488" url="?curid=1098538" title="Sukiyaki (song)">
<text>, alternatively titled &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, is a song by Japanese crooner Kyu Sakamoto, first released in Japan in 1961. The song topped the charts in a number of countries, including the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1963. The song grew to become one of the world&#x27;s best-selling singles of all time, selling over 13 million copies worldwide.

==Composition==
&quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; () was written by lyricist Rokusuke Ei and composer Hachidai Nakamura. The lyrics tell the story of a man who looks up and whistles while he is walking so that his tears will not fall, with the verses describing his memories and feelings. Ei wrote the lyrics while walking home from participating in the 1960 Anpo protests against the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty, expressing his frustration and dejection at the failed efforts to stop the treaty. However, the lyrics were purposely generic so that they might refer to any lost love.

The English-language lyrics of the version recorded by A Taste of Honey are not a translation of the original Japanese lyrics, but instead a completely different set of lyrics arranged to the same basic melody.

== Cultural significance ==
The song spent three weeks at the top of the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in June 1963. It has been described as a metaphor for the emerging post-World War II global expansion of Japan onto the world scene.

==English title==
In Anglophone countries, the song is best known under the alternative title &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, the name of a Japanese hot-pot dish with cooked beef. The word sukiyaki does not appear in the song&#x27;s lyrics, nor does it have any connection to them; it was used only because it was short, catchy, recognizably Japanese, and more familiar to English speakers. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist compared this re-titling to issuing &quot;Moon River&quot; in Japan under the title &quot;Beef Stew&quot;.

Well-known English-language cover versions with altogether different lyrics often go by the alternative name or something completely different, including &quot;My First Lonely Night&quot; by Jewel Akens in 1966, and &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; by A Taste of Honey in 1980 (see below). The song has also been recorded in other languages.

==Commercial performance==
In Japan, &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; topped the Popular Music Selling Record chart in the Japanese magazine &quot;Music Life&quot; for three months, and was ranked as the number one song of 1961 in Japan.

In the US, &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1963, one of the few non-English songs to have done so, and the first in a non-European language. It was the only single by an Asian artist to top the Hot 100 until the 2020 release of &quot;Dynamite&quot; by the South Korean band BTS. &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; also peaked at number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, and spent five weeks at number one on the Middle of the Road chart.

Sakamoto&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, &quot;China Nights (Shina no Yoru)&quot;, charted in 1963 at number 58. That was the last song by an artist from Japan to reach the US pop chart for 16 years, until the female duo Pink Lady had a top-40 hit in 1979 with its English-language song &quot;Kiss in the Dark&quot;.

Internationally, the song is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 13 million copies worldwide.

==Legacy==
An instrumental version of the song was played by NASA over the radio for the Gemini VII astronauts as mood music, thereby becoming one of the first pieces of music sent to humans in space.

On 16 March 1999, Japan Post issued a stamp that commemorated the song. The stamp is listed in the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue as Japan number 2666 with a face value of 50 yen.

In the wake of 11 March, 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Suntory beverage company released several commercials that included this song (as well as &quot;Miagete goran yoru no hoshi o&quot;), with 71 actors and singers singing parts of the song, followed by the title caption &quot;ue wo muite arukou&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;let&#x27;s walk with our heads up&quot;, as a way to motivate Japanese people to &quot;keep moving forward towards tomorrow&quot;, giving a message of hope. This song was also heard in the Studio Ghibli film &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot; of the same year.

On 15 October 2020, Google honored the song and singer Kyu Sakamoto with a Google Doodle on the 59th anniversary of his first album.

In the summer of 2021, the song was performed in remix during the closing ceremony of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo (which had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions).

==Covers and variations (as &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;)==

===A Taste of Honey version===
====Background====
A Taste of Honey vocalist Janice-Marie Johnson would recall how at age nine she had heard Kyu Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; on the radio in the summer of 1963 and said: &quot;Mom! Buy me this record!&quot;, as despite not understanding the lyrics she was deeply moved by the song. Constantly playing the single, Johnson phonetically learned its lyrics and taught them to her sister, with the pair participating in neighborhood talent shows singing &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; while performing their approximation of an Oriental dance number. Years later, after A Taste of Honey had scored their 1978 number-one hit &quot;Boogie Oogie Oogie&quot;, Johnson heard the Linda Ronstadt hit remake of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&#x27; &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot; on her car radio causing Johnson to realize that remaking a 1960s hit could be a good career move for A Taste of Honey, with Johnson&#x27;s obvious choice for the remake being her beloved &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;. Johnson contacted the song&#x27;s Japanese lyricist Rokusuke Ei who provided her with a literal translation of what he had written. As this translation did not yield complete sentences in English, Johnson endeavored to write a new set of lyrics she felt would capture the spirit of the song. To Johnson, it seemed the song&#x27;s original lyrics had 3 possible interpretations: as the mindset of a man facing execution; as someone trying to be optimistic despite life&#x27;s trials; or as the story of an ended love affair. Johnson decided: &quot;me being the hopeless romantic that I am, I decided to write about a love gone bad.&quot;

According to Johnson, when Cecil Hale, vice-president of Capitol Records, heard her sing the lyrics she had written for &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; in the slow balladic style she envisioned for the track, &quot;he said, &#x27;absolutely not! Black people don&#x27;t want to hear Japanese music.&#x27; I was stunned [having been] so sure he would like it. I looked at him and I said &#x27;Last time I looked in a mirror I was black and I want to hear it. Producer George Duke, who was assigned to produce the upcoming A Taste of Honey album &quot;Twice as Sweet&quot;, shared Hale&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm. Duke recalled: Man, what am I going to do with &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;?&#x27; I thought [Johnson] was crazy, but I said &#x27;If that&#x27;s what she wants to do, I&#x27;ll do it. Johnson would recall Duke, &quot;thought we could do a kind of uptempo version [but] I [saw] it as a love ballad, which is how it was done. [Duke] did a fantastic arrangement.&quot; Duke replied, &quot;we did the song and had Clare Fischer do the string arrangement and brought June [Kuramoto] in to give it a Japanese flavor&quot; – Kuramoto being a koto player whom Duke knew from the jazz band Hiroshima – &quot;We added an R&amp;B section, and that was it. It was a simple tune I never thought would become a hit. To this day, I can&#x27;t believe it was as big a record as it was.&quot;

Cecil Hale remained resistant to the track: as late as the master for &quot;Twice as Sweet&quot; being placed on the disc cutter &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; was omitted, the track only being added to &quot;Twice as Sweet&quot; before the album&#x27;s August 1980 release after some eleventh hour negotiations between Johnson and Capitol Records, most essentially that Johnson be disallowed credit or royalties for her new lyrics (Capitol Records held the copyright of the Kyu Sakamoto original). After the album&#x27;s uptempo advance single &quot;Rescue Me&quot; fell short of the R&amp;B chart Top Ten and failed to cross over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Johnson urged for &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; to be the next single only for Capitol to issue another uptempo track: &quot;I&#x27;m Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout You&quot;, which would stall at number 64 on the R&amp;B chart. Capitol did finally afford single release to &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; in January 1981, the track being both serviced to radio and shipped to retail the first week of the year and being re-serviced to radio two weeks later in a promotional package that included a folding fan: in February 1981 – as &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; moved up the R&amp;B chart Top 40 and began charting on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 – Capitol reinforced the single&#x27;s radio profile by sending out 6,000 custom-cut fan-shaped promo copies of &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; to pop- and R&amp;B-oriented radio stations. The &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; single was packaged in a picture sleeve showing Johnson and her A Taste of Honey partner, Hazel Payne, wearing kimono, and the duo were similarly dressed in their television performances to promote the single. These performances featured a traditional Japanese fan dance by Johnson, while Payne (who was not featured on the recording of &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;) played (or in mimed performances appeared to play) June Kuramoto&#x27;s koto part. A number-one hit on both the R&amp;B and A/C chart, &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; crossed over to number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1981.

===4 P.M. version===

American R&amp;B group 4 P.M. released a version of &quot;Sukiyaki&quot; in 1994 as their debut single. This version reached number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The group remade the song—utilizing the English-language lyrics of the A Taste of Honey version—at the suggestion of Next Plateau Records president Eddie O&#x27;Loughlin. The 4 P.M. version was also a top-10 hit in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, where it topped &quot;The Record&quot;″s sales chart.

===Other versions===
In 1963, the British record label Pye Records released an instrumental cover version of the song by Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen. They were concerned that English-speaking audiences might find the original title too difficult to remember/pronounce, so they gave it the new title of &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;. This title was retained when Capitol Records in the United States, and His Master&#x27;s Voice in the UK, released Kyu Sakamoto&#x27;s original version a few months later.

American singer Selena covered the song for her 1989 self-titled album which received some airplay at the time of its release. The song was later released as a single in the United States and Japan &amp; was included in several of Selena&#x27;s greatest hits packages before and after her death.

Electronic artist Soichi Terada sampled the 4 P.M. cover of the song for the track &quot;Sukiyaki Dohyo Chanko&quot; on his 1996 album &quot;Sumo Jungle Grandeur&quot;.

Many other artists have recorded cover versions of the song, while others have written and/or performed songs based on the melody.

<doc id="1098542" wikidata="Q959558" url="?curid=1098542" title="Seven Seas">
<text>&quot;The Seven Seas&quot; is a figurative term for all the seas of the known world. The phrase is used in reference to sailors and pirates in the arts and popular culture and can be associated with the Mediterranean Sea, the Arabian Seven Seas east of Africa and Indian subcontinent (as told with Sinbad&#x27;s seven journeys, and Captain Kidd), or is sometimes applied to the Caribbean Sea and seas around the Americas (with pirates such as Blackbeard). 

The terminology of a &quot;seven seas&quot; with varying definitions was part of the vernacular of several peoples (as in the prior mentioned seas of Arabic literature), long before the oceans of the world became known (to those peoples). The term can now also be taken to refer to these seven oceanic bodies of water:

* the Arctic Ocean
* the North Atlantic Ocean
* the South Atlantic Ocean
* the Indian Ocean
* the North Pacific Ocean
* the South Pacific Ocean
* the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean

The World Ocean is also known as just &quot;the sea&quot;, the expanse emanating from any marginal sea. The International Hydrographic Organization lists over 23 distinct bodies of water called seas.

The modern practice of debating which bodies of water are the seven seas is separate from the etymology of the term. Plausible etymologies are discussed below including the Po river delta in the north Adriatic sea. The phrase’s association with the world oceans in the late 19th century is characterized by Rudyard Kipling’s 1896 book &quot;The Seven Seas&quot;.

==Arabs==
The Arabs and their near neighbours considered the Seven Seas () to be the seas that they encountered in their voyages to The East. They were trading routes in ancient times and since the time of Muhammad, they are the places where Islam spread and is widely practised.

In the 9th century AD, author Ya&#x27;qubi wrote:
Whoever wants to go to China must cross seven seas, each one with its own color and wind and fish and breeze, completely unlike the sea that lies beside it. The first of them is the Sea of Fars, which men sail setting out from Siraf. It ends at Ra’s al-Jumha; it is a strait where pearls are fished. The second sea begins at Ra’s al-Jumha and is called Larwi. It is a big sea, and in it is the Island of Waqwaq and others that belong to the Zanj. These islands have kings. One can only sail this sea by the stars. It contains huge fish, and in it are many wonders and things that pass description. The third sea is called Harkand, and in it lies the Island of Sarandib, in which are precious stones and rubies. Here are islands with kings, but there is one king over them. In the islands of this sea grow bamboo and rattan. The fourth sea is called Kalah and is shallow and filled with huge serpents. Sometimes they ride the wind and smash ships. Here are islands where the camphor tree grows. The fifth sea is called Salahit and is very large and filled with wonders. The sixth sea is called Kardanj; it is very rainy. The seventh sea is called the sea of Sanji, also known as Kanjli. It is the sea of China; one is driven by the south wind until one reaches a freshwater bay, along which are fortified places and cities, until one reaches Khanfu.
This passage demonstrates the Seven Seas as referenced in Medieval Arabian literature:

* The Persian Gulf (&quot;Sea of Fars&quot;)
* The Arabian Sea (&quot;Sea of Larwi&quot;)
* The Bay of Bengal (&quot;Sea of Harkand&quot;)
* The Strait of Malacca (&quot;Sea of Kalah&quot;)
* The Singapore Strait (&quot;Sea of &quot;)
* The Gulf of Thailand (&quot;Sea of Kadranj&quot;)
* The South China Sea (&quot;Sea of Sanji&quot;)

Arab seafarers may have also considered other important seas nearby which they navigated regularly, including the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Adriatic Sea.

==East Indies==
In British Colonial times the Clipper Ship Tea Route from China to England was the longest trade route in the world. It took sailors through seven seas near the Dutch East Indies: the Banda Sea, the Celebes Sea, the Flores Sea, the Java Sea, the South China Sea, the Sulu Sea, and the Timor Sea. The Seven Seas referred to those seas, and if someone had sailed the Seven Seas it meant he had sailed to, and returned from, the other side of the world.

==Greeks==
The term in modern usage originated from Greece, where the seven seas were considered as:

* The Adriatic Sea
* The Arabian Sea
* The Black Sea
* The Caspian Sea
* The Mediterranean Sea
* The Persian Sea
* The Red Sea

==Romans==
The meaning of (Latin) in Ancient Rome is different than the phrase &quot;seven seas&quot; in the modern era. The navigable network in the mouths of the Po river discharges into saltmarshes on the Adriatic shore and was colloquially called the &quot;Seven Seas&quot; in ancient Roman times. Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and fleet commander, wrote about these lagoons, separated from the open sea by sandbanks:
All those rivers and trenches were first made by the Etruscans, thus discharging the flow of the river across the marshes of the Atriani called the Seven Seas, with the famous harbor of the Etruscan town of Atria which formerly gave the name of Atriatic to the sea now called the Adriatic.
A history of Venice states:
The expression &quot;to sail the seven seas&quot; was a classical flourish signifying nautical skill. It was applied to the Venetians long before they sailed the oceans.
It is plausible that the English idiom is borrowed from this Venetian idiom, with a loss of geographic context.

==Persians==
The Persians used the term &quot;the Seven Seas&quot; to refer to the streams forming the Oxus River.

==Talmudists==
The Babylonian Talmud mentions seven seas and four rivers that surround the land of Israel. In Tractate &quot;Bava Batra, fol. 74b&quot;, it reads:
&quot;When R. Dimi came he said R. Yohanan said:&quot; &quot;What is the meaning of the verse, &#x27;For he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.&#x27; (Ps. 24:2)? This refers to the seven seas and four rivers that surround the land of Israel. And what are the seven seas? The sea of Tiberias, the Sea of Sodom, the Sea of Helath, the Sea of Hiltha, the Sea of Sibkay, the Sea of Aspamia and the Great Sea. And what are the four rivers? The Jordan, the Yarmuk, the Keramyhon and Pigah.&quot;
According to this and other passages, the Talmudic Seven Seas include:

* Sea of Tiberias (Lake Tiberias or The Sea of Galilee)
* Sea of Sodom (The Dead Sea)
* Sea of Helath (The Red Sea)
* Sea of Hiltha (Birkat Ram)
* Sea of Sibkay (Lake Hula)
* Sea of Aspamia (A lake said to be north of Apamia on the Asi River, possibly the formerly flooded Al-Ghab Plain)
* The Great Sea (The Mediterranean Sea)

Various transliterations for the sea names from Hebrew exist. For Helath: &quot;Chelath&quot; and &quot;Shelyith&quot;. For Hiltha: &quot;Chiltha&quot; and &quot;Chultha&quot;. For Sibkay: &quot;Sibchi&quot; and &quot;Somcho&quot;. And for Aspamia: &quot;Apamia&quot;.

The 17th century churchman and scholar John Lightfoot mentions this set of seas in his &quot;Commentary on the New Testament&quot;. A chapter titled &quot;The Seven Seas according to the Talmudists, and the four Rivers compassing the Land&quot; includes the &quot;Great Sea&quot; (now called the Mediterranean Sea), the &quot;Sea of Tiberias&quot; (Sea of Galilee), the &quot;Sea of Sodom&quot; (Dead Sea), the &quot;Lake of Samocho&quot; (probably the (mostly) dried-up Hula Lake, called Semechonitis by Josephus and lake Sumchi in the Talmud), also called the &quot;Sibbichaean&quot;. Lightfoot does not comment on the remaining three seas.

==Early modern==

After the discovery of the Americas during the Age of Discovery, the &quot;seven seas&quot; were reckoned by some as:
* the Pacific Ocean
* the Atlantic Ocean
* the Indian Ocean
* the Arctic Ocean
* the Mediterranean Sea
* the Caribbean Sea
* the Gulf of Mexico

The last two of these are now reckoned to be part of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean either part of the Atlantic or omitted. Splitting the Atlantic and Pacific into north and south and adding the Southern Ocean returns the list to seven.

Detailed reckonings of the divisions of the world ocean into oceans and seas is not limited to lists of seven. For example, the International Hydrographic Organization recognizes many marginal seas; some saltwater lakes and the freshwater Sea of Galilee also have &quot;sea&quot; in their names.

<text>was a after &quot;Eikyō&quot; and before &quot;Bun&#x27;an&quot;. This period spanned the years from February 1441 through February 1444. The reigning emperor was .

==Change of era==
* 1451 : The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Eikyō&quot; 13.

==Events of the &quot;Kakitsu&quot; era==
* July 12, 1441 (&quot;Kakitsu 1, 24th day of the 6th month&quot;): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshinori is murdered at age 48 by Akamatsu Mitsusuke who was upset that Akamatsu Sadaura was made leader of the Akamatsu clan. Shortly thereafter, Yoshinori&#x27;s 8-year-old son, Ashikaga Yoshikatsu, was proclaimed as the new &quot;shōgun&quot;.
*July 12–28, 1441: A number of prominent nobles were also killed defending Shōgun Yoshinori directly through the fighting including Kyōgoku Takakazu, the Shugo of Yamashiro Province and Ōuchi Mochiyo (1394–1441), the head of the Ōuchi clan.
* 1441 (&quot;Kakitsu 1, 9th month&quot;): The murderers of Yoshinori kill themselves.
* 1443 (&quot;Kakitsu 3&quot;): A Japanese-Korean diplomatic agreement (sometimes called the &quot;Kakitsu treaty&quot;) regularized an initial plan for mitigating the damage caused by pirates (&quot;wakō&quot;). The bilateral agreement assigned the responsibility for monitoring ships from Japan en route to Korea. The Sō clan of Tsushima han (Tsushima Island) were given the right to license ships sailing west beyond Tsushima; and this also encompassed the opportunity to profit from whatever fees the Sō might charge.
* August 16, 1443 (&quot;Kakitsu 3, 21st day of the 7th month&quot;): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Yoshikatsu died at the age of 10. He liked riding horses very much; but he was gravely injured in a fall from a horse. This was the cause of his death. He had been shōgun for only three years. His 8-year-old brother, Ashikaga Yoshinari, was then named &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* October 16, 1443 (&quot;Kakitsu 3, 23rd day of the 9th month&quot;): An armed group of rebels penetrated the palace defenses. A fire was started and one of the men sought to kill Go-Hanazono, but the emperor escaped. However, the intruders managed to steal the Three Sacred Treasures – the mirror, the sword and the jewel. Later, a guard found the mirror and a priest found the sword, but the location of jewel was not known until the 8th month of &quot;Bunnan gannen&quot;.

<doc id="1098547" wikidata="Q7460164" url="?curid=1098547" title="Shackerley Marmion">
<text>Shackerley Marmion (January 1603 – 1639), also Shakerley, Shakerly, Schackerley, Marmyon, Marmyun, or Mermion, was an early 17th-century dramatist, often classed among the Sons of Ben, the followers of Ben Jonson who continued his style of comedy. He was also a friend and perhaps a protégé of Thomas Heywood.

==Background==
The playwright&#x27;s father, Shackerley Marmion (son of a London lawyer and member of a junior line of the Marmion Barons of Tamworth), held the manor at Aynho in Northamptonshire but was habitually in debt; in time he would pass his debts on to his son. Shakerley Jnr was baptised on 21 Jan 1603 in Aynho church.

After Lord Williams&#x27;s School at Thame in Oxfordshire, Marmion graduated from Wadham College, Oxford, with an M.A. in July 1624. (During his years at Oxford, his father Shackerley Marmion was forced to sell his estate an Aynho to pay his debts.) Details of his life after university are unclear, though there are intimations of legal troubles, disorderly affairs, dodging creditors. He fought in the Low Countries during this period, apparently under Sir Sigismund Alexander according to Anthony à Wood, and in 1629 was indicted for assaulting one Edward Moore with his sword and wounding the man&#x27;s head. He was arrested and released on bail, but did not surrender at the next session; further records of the incident have not been found.

==Plays==
Marmion&#x27;s first known play was &quot;Holland&#x27;s Leaguer&quot;, produced in 1631 at the Salisbury Court theatre and acted six days in succession, &quot;one of the longest known [runs] in the Elizabethan, Jacobean, or Caroline theatre,&quot; though perhaps due more to the meagreness of the repertory of Prince Charles&#x27;s Men than to the play&#x27;s unusual popularity. Marmion&#x27;s second play, &quot;A Fine Companion&quot;, was staged in 1632 or 1633 and published in the latter year, after being performed by the Prince Charles&#x27;s Men at Salisbury Court Theatre. &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (c. 1634–36), his third and last play, was acted by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and published in 1641.

All comedies, Marmion&#x27;s plays show the influence of Ben Jonson. Marmion adapted Jonsonian comedy to his own preoccupation with Platonic love. And while he is often classified by critics as a limited talent and a figure of at best secondary importance, his knack with satire has frequently been praised.

==Other works==
Besides his comedies, Marmion wrote a 2000-line verse epic, &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; (1637), a translation and expansion of the Cupid and Psyche story in Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; in heroic couplets. He also wrote various minor poems, including an elegy on Jonson, published in 1638, titled &quot;A Funeral Sacrifice, to the Sacred Memory of his Thrice-Honored Father, Ben Jonson.&quot; Commendatory verses that he wrote for others, or that others wrote for him, associate Marmion with Heywood, Thomas Nabbes, Richard Brome, and the actor Joseph Taylor.

==Last years==
In 1638 Marmion joined Sir John Suckling&#x27;s privately organized military incursion against the Scottish Covenanters; but he fell out along the route due to illness and returned in London, where he died the following year.

<text>Reghin (; , or ; ; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Reen&quot;) is a city in Mureș County, Transylvania, central Romania, on the Mureș River. As of 2021, it had a population of 29,742, making it the second biggest city of the Mureș county, just behind the capital Târgu Mureș and ahead of Sighișoara.

== Location ==
Reghin lies north-northeast of Târgu Mureș, extending on both shores of the river Mureș, at the confluence with the Gurghiu River. It was created by the 1926 union of the German-inhabited (formerly Szászrégen) and the Hungarian-inhabited (formerly Magyarrégen) city, and later joined with the two smaller communities of Apalina (Hungarian: &quot;Abafája&quot;; German: &quot;Bendorf&quot;) and Iernuțeni (Hungarian: &quot;Radnótfája&quot;; German: &quot;Etschdorf&quot;), added in 1956. Formally, the latter two are separate villages administered by the city.

The city is on the Târgu Mureș–Deda–Gheorgheni Romanian Railways line 405.

== History ==
Reghin was first mentioned in 1228 in a charter of Hungarian King Andrew II as &quot;Regun&quot; – however, evidence of its strategic location and defence system suggests that the town might have been considerably older, possibly founded by Ladislaus I.

Despite the devastations of the city during the Mongol invasion (1241) and during the Tatar and Cuman incursions (1285), the town developed rapidly: already in the second half of the 13th century the city was the residence and power centre of the families Tomaj and Kacsik, to whom the nearby lands were awarded by the Hungarian Crown. Reghin became a minor ecclesiastical centre in 1330, with the building of the Gothic church (Roman Catholic at the time, it now serves the Protestant community) in the German part of the city; it is still the largest church in the area, and hosts the oldest Medieval Latin inscription of any church in Transylvania. The Hungarian part of the city has an even older church, initially built in the Romanesque style.

At the beginning of the 15th century the settlement gained city rights, and, from 1427, the right to hold fairs. In the 16th and 17th century Reghin was devastated by Habsburg and Ottoman troops on several occasions. It burned to the ground in 1848. In 1850 the town had 4,227 inhabitants, of which 2,964 were Germans, 644 Romanians, 556 Hungarians, 40 Jews, and 3 Roma. In 1910, the population of the city included 7,310 inhabitants, of which 2,994 were Germans, 2,947 Hungarians, and 1,311 Romanians.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of the area in December 1918, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The city officially became part of the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon, under which Hungary relinquished all of Transylvania. In August 1940, the Second Vienna Award, arbitrated by Germany and Italy, reassigned the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Reghin) from Romania to Hungary. Almost 30% of the inhabitants were Jews at that time. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the Reghin ghetto and on 4 June 1944 were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Towards the end of World War II, Romanian and Soviet armies entered the city in October 1944. The territory of Northern Transylvania remained under Soviet military administration until March 9, 1945, after the appointment of Petru Groza as Prime Minister, when the city again became part of Romania.

After the war, Reghin lost some of its former Transylvanian Saxon character — as many Germans left for West Germany during the later stages of Communist Romania — and ethnic Romanians and Hungarians were settled in their place. The data of the 1992 census showed a population of 24,601 Romanians, 12,471 Hungarians, 1,790 Romani, and 346 Germans. In 1994, Reghin was declared a city.

== Jewish history of Reghin ==
Jews began to settle in Reghin at the close of the 18th century, an organized community was established only during the middle of the 19th century, probably in 1849. The majority of the Jews came from Bukovina and Galicia. As a result of the battles during the Revolution of 1848 against Austria and the riots in Transylvania, Reghin and its Jewish population suffered severely. The first Jewish settlers, who arrived mainly from Bukovina and Galicia, were Orthodox, and the community remained Orthodox throughout its existence. Hasidic influence was also felt. Besides the synagogue, there were two kloyzn (houses of prayer) where the Hasidim used to pray and had their own rabbis. A prominent figure in the community during its early years was the Orthodox rabbi Hillel Pollak, who was spiritually close to the extreme Orthodox rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein.

A Jewish elementary school was founded in 1874. (Later it ceased its activities but was reestablished in 1910 and functioned until 1940.) The language of instruction in the school was Hungarian until 1918, after which it was Romanian. In 1885 the community became the administrative center for all the Jews of the district. The community numbered 282 in 1866, about 40 families in 1889, and 394 persons (about 7% of the total population) in 1891. Jews engaged in commerce, industry, and crafts. Their trade and industry were mainly connected with timber and some of them owned sawmills; there were also unskilled Jewish workers employed in the timber industry. The institutions of the community assisted the poor. Some of the Ḥadarim established by the community translated the Pentateuch into German instead of Yiddish in order to facilitate study of this language by the children. From 1919 there was considerable Zionist activity in Reghin, and many members of the youth organizations emigrated to Israel. The community numbered 1,587 (about 16% of the total population) in 1930, and 1,653 (about 10% of the total) in 1941.

Between the two world wars, the Jews suffered from the nationalist and antisemitic activities of members of the Iron Guard, and from the official antisemitic policies of most of the Romanian governments. The change of rule in 1940 (from Romanian to Hungarian) did not bring with it any improvement, as was hoped by the Jews, who remembered their legal emancipation in 1867 by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.

=== Holocaust and aftermath ===
In the summer of 1944 the local Jews were concentrated into a ghetto set up in a brick factory. Jews from the surrounding area were also brought there. From this ghetto about 6,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz by the Hungarian authorities, at the request of the Nazi occupiers.

After World War II, in 1947 a community numbering about 820 was formed mostly by survivors of the death camps and other Jews who had arrived in Reghin from places in different parts of Romania. The community gradually declined as a result of emigration to Israel and elsewhere. In 1971 there were still some 20 to 25 Jewish families living in Reghin and even fewer in the early 21st century.

== Architecture ==
Reghin possesses some of the architectural elements that are unique in Transylvania. The stylistic details and the wrought iron balconies in the centre of the town are examples that prove the artistry of the local craftsmen. One passes everyday by the apparently modest, yet defining signs of an ancient civilization. They personalize almost each and every building from the center of the town, making the visitor feel the fragrance of times gone by.

The Evangelical church also known as the &quot;Saxon church&quot; has a tower that measures more than 47m high. The four smaller towers are proofs of the town&#x27;s &quot;Right to the sword&quot;. The construction of the church began at the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the architecture was modified because the church underwent many dramatic events. It was set on fire in 1400, 1630, and 1778. The documents reveal the use of several styles of early and transition Gothic style. The church was consolidated in 1501 and since 1551, when the Transylvanian Saxons adopted the Lutheran Reformation, on the main wall are written the words: &quot;Redemption cometh not from war, it is for peace that we all pray.&quot;. Inside the church there is an organ with 20 registers that dates from 1784.

The Huszar Castle, formerly Bornemisza, situated in Apalina dates from the 13th–14th centuries and was restored in the 19th century. In the old mansion of the castle lived between 1584 and 1592 Gyulai Pál of Apalina (1559–1592). He was a royal diplomat, historian, chronicler, doctor, and classical poet. The castle was built in the Renaissance style with baroque elements. In 1953 the castle was taken over and used by different educational institutions for disabled persons. It has recently been returned to its owners according to the new laws of property.

== Culture ==
The &quot;Petru Maior&quot; municipal library has more than 130,000 books, one of which dating from the 16th century. Another important book is Petru Maior&#x27;s &quot;History of the Romanians&#x27; Origins in Dacia&quot;.

The Ethnographic Museum has a rich patrimony, grouped in 49 collections of ethnography, folk art, artistry, records. The edifice is a monument of architecture built in 1892. The items exhibited concern trades, national costumes, and tradition specific to the upper course of the Mureș River, the Gurghiu valley, and part of the Transylvanian Plain.

The &quot;Eugen Nicoară&quot; community centre was built between 1938 and 1939 when Dr. Eugen Nicoară was the president of the Reghin department of Astra Foundation. Representations of theatre, folk music, dances, chamber music, etc. are held on the stage of this building.

The building in which the &quot;Alexandru Ceușianu&quot; secondary school functions was constructed in 1870 and housed the local law court. Lately in the post-war period, there was the Hungarian pedagogical school. Close by was the house of the writer and magistrate Alexandru Ceușianu.

== Economy ==
The industry of Reghin is closely related to the traditions of the medieval trades and of the modern cooperative associations. Starting with the resources in the close vicinity, rich in wood and farm produces, the goods of the private producers from Reghin are in the market all over Romania and abroad. The wood processing industry is represented by companies such as Larix, Gralemn, Remex, Bucin-Mob, Prolemn, and Amis. Reghin is well known for the industry of the musical instruments, especially of violins. There are many companies that produce instruments using the famous resonance wood from the Călimani and Gurghiu forests. The violins made in Reghin are used abroad. The &quot;Hora&quot; Company is the first to manufacture instruments. In time, other companies were set up among which &quot;Gliga Instrumente Muzicale&quot;. Yehudi Menuhin used a violin made by &quot;Gliga&quot; company.

== Sport ==
Reghin is represented by Avântul Reghin in association football. Avântul played in Liga I in the 1955 season. The team played in Liga III during the 2015–16 season.

<text>Sir Theodore Martin (16 September 1816 – 18 August 1909) was a Scottish poet, biographer, and translator.

==Biography==
Martin was born in Edinburgh, the only son of Mary, the daughter of James Reid, a shipowner from Fraserburgh and James Martin, a solicitor. He was educated at the Royal High School and attended the University of Edinburgh from 1830-1833. He practised as a solicitor in Edinburgh 1840–45, after which he went to London and became head of the firm of Martin and Leslie, parliamentary agents.

His first contribution to literature was the humorous &quot;Bon Gaultier Ballads&quot;, written along with W.E. Aytoun, which remained popular for a long time; originally contributed to a magazine, they appeared in book form in 1845.

Martin&#x27;s translations include Dante&#x27;s &quot;Vita Nuova&quot;, Oehlenschläger&#x27;s &quot;Correggio&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Heinrich Heine&#x27;s &quot;Poems and Ballads&quot;, Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Tell&quot;, and Hertz&#x27;s &quot;King René&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He also published a complete translation of Horace with a &quot;Life&quot;, and one of Catullus.

He is probably best known for his &quot;Life of the Prince Consort&quot; (1874–80), the writing of which was entrusted to him by Queen Victoria, a work which won him her lifelong friendship. He also wrote &quot;Lives&quot; of Professor Aytoun and Lord Lyndhurst.In 1851 he married Helena Faucit, a well-known actress, and author of studies on &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Female Characters&quot;, whose &quot;Life&quot; he published in 1901. The couple lived for some time at Bryntysilio (The Hill of St. Tyssilio) which he bought in 1861, near Llangollen, where in 1889 they were visited by the queen during her progress in Wales.

Martin kept up his intellectual activity into old age, published in 1905 a translation of Leopardi&#x27;s poems, and &quot;Monographs&quot; (1906). He was Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews in 1881, received an LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1875, and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1880. 

He died in 1909 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

<text>Count Sámuel Teleki de Szék (1 November 1845 – 10 March 1916) was a Hungarian explorer who led the first expedition to Northern Kenya. He was the first European to see Lake Turkana.

==Early life==
Teleki was born in 1845 in Sáromberke, a village in Transylvania, then in the Kingdom of Hungary and today in Romania. He was a member of the Teleki family, a prominent Hungarian family active in both politics and culture. His great-grandfather Sámuel Teleki (1739–1822), a chancellor of Transylvania, had founded the Teleki library in Marosvásárhely (today Târgu Mureș, Romania), one of the first Hungarian public libraries, which opened in 1802 and holds today more than 200,000 volumes.

For some 40 years, Count Sámuel Teleki von Szék, &quot;a jovial Hungarian aristocrat of immense wealth,&quot; managed his property and assets and started a political career by becoming a member of the Hungarian Upper House of Parliament in 1881. A keen hunter, he was fascinated by the early African explorers. In 1886, he accepted a suggestion by his friend and benefactor, Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, son of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor-King Franz Joseph I, to turn the East African safari he was planning into a journey of exploration of the territories north of Lake Baringo. He was to explore the lands beyond where Scottish explorer Joseph Thomson had set foot, in order to find the desert lake previous travellers had heard rumours about, based on local legends about a sea that lay beyond the desert, surrounded by tribes of giants and islands inhabited by monsters and ghosts.

==His first expedition==
Count Teleki and his companion, Lieutenant Ludwig von Höhnel, an Austrian naval officer, left Pangani (Tanzania) in February 1887 with around 400 porters, following the Ruvu River. They were the first to survey a great part of the East African Rift. Teleki was the first to reach the snow-line on Mount Kilimanjaro at , and the first explorer to set foot on Mount Kenya, climbing up to around . He later headed on northwards, following the interior river system, to see on 5 March 1888 the last of the African Great Lakes, referred to as the Jade Sea by Count Teleki, who named the lake after his friend, Prince Rudolf. The lake was renamed Turkana in 1975 after the people that live to the west of its shores. Teleki&#x27;s and von Höhnel&#x27;s journey in southern Ethiopia also unveiled a smaller lake, Stefanie (named after Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, the prince&#x27;s wife), now called Lake Chew Bahir. Though it is commonly stated that he discovered the body of water now referred to as Lake Turkana, the African people living around the lake certainly were aware of it. Even if the meaning of the word &quot;discovery&quot; is taken so as to put that aside, the existence of the lake was known in Europe decades prior to Teleki&#x27;s expedition. As far back as 1849, Dr. Ludwig Krapf wrote about the Samburu people and his intentions of visiting their lands. A far more direct reference to the lake is found in an 1869 article in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. Here, the author, who himself relied on descriptions from African long distance traders, described a large water body. The article included a detailed map and here, the position, general shape and orientation are a perfect match for Lake Turkana.

==His collection==
Teleki and Höhnel made many observations on the climate, flora and fauna of the territories visited. One of the giant Lobelia plants found in the Afro-alpine belt of Mount Kenya is named Lobelia telekii, after Count Samuel Teleki. They also collected more than 400 ethnographical objects, most of them from Maasai and Kikuyu people and brought home a valuable collection of plants and animals.

==Teleki&#x27;s volcano==
During the return to the East African coast, which they reached at Mombasa in October 1888, along the dry riverbed of the Turkwel, Teleki discovered an active volcano (Teleki’s Volcano) in South Kenya. On their way back, they stopped at Aden whence Teleki apparently intended to explore at a later date the Ethiopian highlands and the great lakes region from the north. In 1895 Teleki was back in Kenya in another unsuccessful effort to climb the Kilimanjaro.

== East African diaries ==
Teleki wrote &quot;East African diaries&quot;, in Hungarian, 1886-95 with English translations. Von Höhnel wrote a report of the expedition entitled &quot;The discovery of Lakes Rudolf and Stefanie&quot;.

After the expedition, Teleki returned to his aristocratic life in Hungary, dying in Budapest after a long illness.

<text>Thomas James Mathias, FRS (c.1754 – August 1835) was a British satirist and scholar.

==Life==
Mathias was educated in Kingston upon Thames and Trinity College, Cambridge. He held some minor appointments in the royal household (sub-treasurer, 1782 and treasurer). His first publication was &quot;Runic Odes&quot;, imitated from the Norse Tongue, in the manner of Thomas Gray, London, 4to, 1781. In 1783 he published, &quot;An Essay on the Evidence, external and internal, relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley&quot;. In 1794 appeared the first part of an anonymous poem, entitled, &quot;The Pursuits of Literature&quot;, which, when completed in four parts, attracted universal attention, chiefly on account of the notes, which abound in deep and discriminating criticism on public men and opinions. Besides several minor pieces of his own, he published the Works of Thomas Gray, with his Life, and Additions, Cambridge, 1814, 2 vols., 4to. In 1817 he settled in Italy and took up his residence at Naples, where he died in 1835. He was a member of the Academy of Arcadia under the name of Larisio Salaminio.

Mathias became a vegetarian after reading Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot;. He gave up all meat and lived on a diet of milk and vegetables.

==Works==
He was an accomplished Italian scholar, and translated various English works into Italian, such as &quot;Canzoni e prose toscane&quot;, and vice versa. He also produced a fine edition of the work of Thomas Gray, on which he lost heavily. His chief work was &quot;The Pursuits of Literature&quot; (1794), an undiscriminating satire on his literary contemporaries that went through 16 editions, but is now almost forgotten. More so was his uncompromising criticism of the times. An example:

:Here is another little &quot;capriccio&quot; of a man of no common sagacity, the late Adam Smith. He says seriously, by way of illustration; “No body &quot;ever saw a dog&quot; make &quot;a fair and deliberate&quot; exchange of &quot;one bone&quot; for another with another &quot;dog&quot;.&quot; Smith&#x27;s Wealth of Nations, Vol. 1, p. 20. Ed. 8vo. This philosophy is nearly of the same date as Adam&#x27;s ancestor in Eden, and I can only say in reply, &quot;Who ever &quot;expected&quot; to see a dog do so?&quot;—We have all heard and read of that snarling sect the Cynics, and if we could convert dogs into philosophers, or what is harder still, philosophical propositions &quot;into meat and bones,&quot; (which I fear is more than most &quot;Scotch&quot; Professors can do) I should apply metaphorically the following lines from a celebrated Poet, a great observer of &quot;human nature&quot;:

::“So when &quot;two dogs&quot; are fighting in the streets,
::With &quot;a third dog&quot; one of &quot;the two dogs&quot; meets;
::With angry tooth he bites him to the bone,
::And &quot;this dog&quot; smarts for what &quot;that dog&quot; has done.”

<text>Trent &quot;Junior&quot; Durkin (July 2, 1915 – May 4, 1935) was an American stage and film actor.

==Career==
Trent Bernard Durkin was born in New York City in 1915. He began his acting career in theater as a child. Durkin first appeared in films in 1930, playing the role of Huckleberry Finn in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1930) and in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1931), both times with Jackie Coogan playing Tom Sawyer. Under contract to RKO Radio Pictures, he was cast in a series of &quot;B&quot; films in comedy roles that capitalized on his gangly appearance. He co-starred in &quot;Hell&#x27;s House&quot; (1932) with then newcomer Bette Davis.

RKO began grooming him for more adult roles. In his final film, &quot;Chasing Yesterday&quot; (1935) starring Anne Shirley, he was billed as Trent Durkin.

==Death==
In 1935, Durkin was returning from a hunting trip in Mexico with Jackie Coogan and three others: Coogan&#x27;s father John Henry Coogan Jr., Charles Jones (manager of the Coogan Ranch) and writer Robert Horner. Coogan&#x27;s father had to swerve to avoid colliding with a car coming straight at him, and his car left the road, rolling repeatedly until it landed in a creek bed. The accident occurred about 50 miles (80 km) from San Diego, California. Jackie Coogan was the only survivor.

At the time, Durkin was living with agent Henry Willson, and they were rumored to be lovers. In a 2013 interview, former child star Diana Serra Cary (known as Baby Peggy), a close friend of Durkin, said, &quot;It would not surprise me to know that Trent was gay. However, in the early thirties it would have been suicidal for such a promising young actor to come out of the closet. Especially without the protection of a strong producer, or already under contract to MGM, with studio head Louis B. Mayer seriously invested in his future success as a leading man.&quot;

Durkin was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<doc id="1098594" wikidata="Q6163996" url="?curid=1098594" title="Jasper Mayne">
<text>Jasper Mayne (1604 – 6 December 1672) was an English clergyman, translator, and a minor poet and dramatist.

Mayne was baptized at Hatherleigh, Devon, on 23 November 1604, and educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. He then entered the Church, was given two college livings in Oxfordshire (the vicarages of Cassington near Woodstock, and Pyrton near Watlington), and in 1646 was made a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.). These livings ended under the Commonwealth (1649–1660), when he was turned out of office to become chaplain to the Duke of Devonshire. After the Restoration, he was made canon of Christ Church (1660–1672), Archdeacon of Chichester (1660–1672), and chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II. Burke records that Dr. Mayne gave £500 towards the rebuilding of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral after the Great Fire of London in 1666.

Mayne wrote two plays before giving up poetry as unbefitting his station: &quot;The City Match&quot; (1639), a domestic farce acted at Whitehall by the command of King Charles I; and &quot;The Amorous War&quot; (1648), a tragicomedy. His other works include a number of poems and sermons; translations of Lucian of Samosata (1638, 1664), and John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Latin Epigrams&quot;; and the preface to the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher first folio.

In an amusing anecdote recounted in Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine, Dr. Mayne is said to have bequeathed a trunk to an old servant, noting that it contained something that would make him drink. When opened, it was found to contain a red herring.

Shakespeare scholar Sidney Lee proposed Jasper Mayne as a possible identity of the &quot;I. M.&quot; who wrote the fourth commendatory verse in the First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (1623). Yet since Mayne was only nineteen years old at the time the Folio was published, scholars have tended to favor James Mabbe.

Mayne died on 6 December 1672 at Oxford, and was interred on the north side of the choir at Christchurch.

<text>USS &quot;Salem&quot; (CS-3/CL-3), Scout Cruiser No. 3, was a scout cruiser of the United States Navy. She was the first Navy ship named for the city of Salem, Massachusetts.

&quot;Salem&quot; was laid down on 28 August 1905, by the Fore River Shipyard; launched on 27 July 1907, sponsored by Mrs. Lorna Pinnock; and commissioned on 1 August 1908.

==Pre-World War I==
As one of the Navy&#x27;s first turbine-engined warships, &quot;Salem&quot; departed Boston on 17 October 1908 to carry out extensive trials along the Atlantic coast. Joining her sister ships, and , in the Scout Cruiser Division in June 1909, &quot;Salem&quot; cruised in the Atlantic, making one voyage to Funchal, Madeira. Assigned to the 5th Division, Atlantic Fleet, in, 1910, &quot;Salem&quot; briefly deployed to Haitian waters during August 1911, returning to the New York Navy Yard on 11 September. Subsequently placed in reserve at the Boston Navy Yard on 20 April 1912, &quot;Salem&quot; relieved as receiving ship there on that date and served until 7 October. Then reassigned to the Reserve Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Salem&quot; subsequently made a cruise to Gibraltar and returned to the United States in late March 1913. Arriving at Hampton Roads on 25 March, she shifted to Philadelphia on 30 March.
&quot;Salem&quot; remained at Philadelphia, in reduced commission, into 1914. On 23 April, &quot;Salem&quot; was placed in full commission and assigned to the Special Service Squadron for duty in Mexican waters. She cruised off the Mexican port of Veracruz supporting US operations ashore until assigned to the Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, on 2 September. Departing Veracruz on 19 September, &quot;Salem&quot; arrived at Boston on 1 October for service with the Atlantic Fleet but was detached from the Cruiser Squadron on 25 November, and was again placed in reserve on 1 December. She relieved &quot;Brooklyn&quot; as a receiving ship at the Boston Navy Yard on 12 March 1915 and served there until assigned to the Caribbean on 21 May 1916. Cruising off Mexican and Dominican ports, &quot;Salem&quot; transported Marine detachments, assisted in radio communication links, and protected United States interests until returning to the Philadelphia Navy Yard to be placed out of commission on 2 December 1916.

==World War I==
Following US entry into World War I, &quot;Salem&quot; was recommissioned on 21 April 1917 for duty as a receiving ship at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Two days later, however, she was decommissioned and towed to the Boston Navy Yard to have her original Curtis turbines replaced by General Electric turbines.

Recommissioned on 25 July, while still undergoing overhaul, &quot;Salem&quot; stood out of Boston harbor on 12 March 1918 for New London, Connecticut, to join a force gathering to convoy submarine chasers across the Atlantic. On 21 March 1918 she damaged the Barge &quot;William C. Moore&quot; in a collision, the Barge later sank at dock in New London, Connecticut. From 31 March-15 June, she served as flagship for two convoys of submarine chasers, leaving both at Ponta Delgada, Azores, and returning westward. On 18 June, she became a flagship of a flotilla of 12 submarine chasers assigned to Key West to operate against German submarines. Arriving at Key West on the 22nd, &quot;Salem&quot;″s force carried out antisubmarine patrols off Florida and as far south as the Yucatán Peninsula through the remainder of World War I.

On 27 November, the force was disbanded; and, after an overhaul at the Boston Navy Yard, &quot;Salem&quot; steamed to the west coast. Designated CL-3 on 17 July 1920, she was decommissioned at Mare Island on 16 August 1921; struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November 1929; and, with cruisers &quot;Albany&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot;, sold on 11 February 1930 to D. G. Seagraves of San Francisco, California, for scrapping.

<text>John Mayne (1759–1836) was a Scottish printer, journalist and poet born in Dumfries. In 1780, his poem &quot;The Siller Gun&quot; appeared in its original form in &quot;Ruddiman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, published by Walter Ruddiman in Edinburgh. It is a humorous work on an ancient custom in Dumfries of shooting for the &quot;Siller Gun.&quot; He also wrote a poem on &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot; in 1780 which influenced Robert Burns&#x27;s 1785 poem &quot;Halloween&quot;. Mayne also wrote a version of the ballad &quot;Helen of Kirkconnel&quot;. His verses were admired by Walter Scott.

==Life==
He was born at Dumfries on 26 March 1759. Educated at the local grammar school, he became a printer in the office of the &quot;Dumfries Journal&quot;. In 1782 he went with his family to Glasgow, where he worked for five years in the publishing house of the brothers Foulis. In 1787 he settled in London, first as a printer, and then as proprietor and joint editor of &quot;The Star&quot;, an evening paper, in which he placed his poems. He died at Lisson Grove, London, 14 March 1836.

==Works==
Mayne wrote poetry in Dumfries, and after 1777 he contributed poems to &quot;Ruddiman&#x27;s Weekly Magazine&quot;, Edinburgh. Between 1807 and 1817 several of his lyrics appeared in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Mayne&#x27;s &quot;Siller Gun&quot; was based on a Dumfries wapinschaw: the competitors were members of the corporations, and the prize a silver cannon-shaped tube presented by James VI. It consisted of twelve stanzas when it appeared in 1777. Enlarged to two cantos in 1779, and to three and four in 1780 and 1808 respectively, it took final shape in five cantos with notes in 1836. It was conceived in the spirit of &quot;Peblis to the Play&quot;.

&quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot;, published in &quot;Ruddiman&#x27;s Weekly Magazine&quot; in November 1780, may have stimulated Burns&#x27;s brilliant treatment of the same theme, according to Chambers, &quot;Life and Work of Burns&quot; (i. 154, ed. 1851). &quot;Logan Braes&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Star&quot;, 23 May 1789, had two lines plagiarised by Burns in a &quot;Logan Braes&quot; of his own. &quot;Glasgow&quot;, published in the &quot;Glasgow Magazine&quot; in December 1783, was enlarged and issued in 1803. In the same year Mayne published a patriotic address &quot;English, Scots, and Irishmen&quot;.

<text>James Melville (26 July 1556 – 1614) was a Scottish divine and reformer, son of the laird of Baldovie, in Forfarshire.

==Life==
Melville was born at Baldovie in Angus in 1556 and he was educated at Montrose and St Leonard&#x27;s College, St Andrews and in 1574 proceeded to the University of Glasgow. There his uncle, Andrew Melville, the reformer and scholar, was principal. Within a year James became one of the regents.

==Teaching role==
When, in 1580, Andrew became Principal of St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews (then called &quot;New College&quot;), James accompanied him, and acted as Professor of Hebrew and Oriental Languages. For three and a half years he lectured in the university, chiefly on Hebrew, but he had to flee to Berwick in May 1584 (a few months after his uncle&#x27;s exile) to escape the attacks of his ecclesiastical enemy, Bishop Patrick Adamson. After a short stay there and at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and again at Berwick, he proceeded to London, where he joined some of the leaders of the Scottish Presbyterian party.

The taking of Stirling Castle in 1585 having changed the political and ecclesiastical positions in the north, he returned to Scotland in November of that year, and was restored to his office at St Andrews. From 1586 to his death he took an active part in Church controversy.

==Other roles==
In 1589 James was moderator of the General Assembly and on several occasions represented his party in conferences with the court. Despite his antagonism to James VI&#x27;s episcopal schemes, he appears to have won the king&#x27;s respect. He answered, with his uncle, a royal summons to London in 1606 for the discussion of Church policy.

The uncompromising attitude of the kinsmen, though it was made the excuse for sending the elder to the Tower, brought no further punishment to James than easy detention within ten miles of Newcastle-on-Tyne. During his residence there it was made clear to him by the king&#x27;s agents that he would receive high reward if he supported the royal plans. In 1613 negotiations were begun for his return to Scotland, but his health was broken, and he died in exile at Berwick on 20 January 1614.

==Legacies==

===Source materials===
Melville has left ample materials for the history of his time from the Presbyterian standpoint, in (a) correspondence with his uncle Andrew Melville (MS. in the library of the university of Edinburgh), and (b) a diary (MS. in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh). The latter is written in a vigorous, fresh style, and is especially direct in its descriptions of contemporaries. His sketch of John Knox at St Andrews is one of his best passages. It is an original authority for the period, written with much naïveté, and revealing an attractive personality.

===Verse===
As a writer of verse he compares unfavourably with his uncle. All his pieces, with the exception of a &quot;libellus supplex&quot; to James VI, are written in Scots. He translated a portion of the Zodiacus vitae of Palingenius, and adapted some passages from Scaliger under the title of &quot;Description of the Spainyarts naturall&quot;. His &quot;Spiritual Propine of a Pastour to his People&quot; (1598), &quot;The Black Bastill, a lamentation for the kirk&quot; (1611), &quot;Thrie may keip Counsell, give Twa be away&quot;, &quot;The Beliefe of the Singing Soul&quot;, &quot;Davids Tragique Fall&quot;, and a number of sonnets show no originality and indifferent technical ability.

The Diary was printed by the Bannatyne Club in 1829, and by the Wodrow Society in 1842. Large portions of it are incorporated in David Calderwood&#x27;s (1575-1650) &quot;History of the Kirk of Scotland&quot; (first printed in 1678). For the life and times, see Thomas M&#x27;Crie&#x27;s &quot;Life of Andrew Melville&quot;.

<doc id="1098615" wikidata="Q734207" url="?curid=1098615" title="Conor McPherson">
<text>Conor McPherson (born 6 August 1971) is an Irish playwright, screenwriter and director of stage and film. In recognition of his contribution to world theatre, McPherson was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature in June 2013 by University College Dublin.

==Early life==
McPherson was born in Dublin. He was educated at University College Dublin and began writing his first plays there as a member of UCD Dramsoc, the college&#x27;s dramatic society, and went on to found Fly by Night Theatre Company which produced several of his plays. He is considered one of the best contemporary Irish playwrights; his plays have attracted good reviews, and have been performed internationally (notably in the West End and on Broadway).

==Career==
&quot;The Weir&quot; opened at the Royal Court before transferring to the West End and Broadway. It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play for 1999.

In the same year he was one of the recipients of the V Europe Prize Theatrical Realities awarded to the Royal Court Theatre (with Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Jez Butterworth, Martin McDonagh).

His 2001 play, &quot;Port Authority&quot; tells of three interwoven lives. The play was first produced by the Gate Theatre of Dublin but premiered at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London in February 2001, before moving to the Gate Theatre in April of that year. The production was directed by McPherson himself. New York&#x27;s Atlantic Theater Company staged a production of the play in the spring of 2008, starring Brian d&#x27;Arcy James, and Tony Award winners John Gallagher Jr. and Jim Norton. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley said, &quot;I found myself holding on to what these actors had to say as if I were a five-year-old at bedtime being introduced to &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;.&quot;

McPherson also directed his play, &quot;Dublin Carol&quot;, at the Atlantic Theater Company, New York, in 2003.

His 2004 play &quot;Shining City&quot; opened at the Royal Court and prompted &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to describe him as &quot;the finest dramatist of his generation&quot;. A meditation on regret, guilt and confusion, the play is set entirely within the Dublin offices of a psychiatrist who himself has psychological secrets. Whilst much of the play takes the form of monologues delivered by a patient, the everyday stories and subtle poignancy and humour make it a riveting experience. It subsequently opened on Broadway in 2006 and was nominated for two Tony Awards, including Best Play.

In September 2006, to great critical acclaim, McPherson made his National Theatre debut as both author and director with &quot;The Seafarer&quot; at the Cottesloe auditorium, starring Karl Johnson and Jim Norton, with Ron Cook as their poker-playing, Mephistophelean guest. Norton won an Olivier Award for his performance while McPherson was nominated for both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play. In October 2007 &quot;The Seafarer&quot; opened on Broadway, keeping with it most of its creative team, including McPherson as director and both Jim Norton and Conleth Hill in their respective roles, with David Morse taking over as Sharky, and Ciarán Hinds portraying Mr. Lockhart. The production on Broadway received some positive reviews including such statements as &quot;McPherson is quite possibly the finest playwright of his generation&quot; from Ben Brantley at &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Succinct, startling and eerie, and the funniest McPherson play to date&quot; from &quot;The Observer&quot;. Norton&#x27;s performance as Richard Harkin in &quot;The Seafarer&quot; at the National Theatre won the 2007 Best Supporting Actor Laurence Olivier Award, and he won a Tony Award in 2008 for Best Featured Actor in a play.

McPherson wrote and directed a stage adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s story &quot;The Birds&quot;, which opened in September 2009 at the Gate Theatre in Dublin.

In 2011 the National Theatre London premiered his play &quot;The Veil&quot; at the Lyttleton. Described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a cracking fireside tale of haunting and decay&quot; it is set in 1822 and marked McPherson&#x27;s first foray into period drama. This vein continued with a striking new translation of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; premiered at the Trafalgar Studios in London at the end of 2012. His version was described as &quot;a profoundly seminal work&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; which also managed, &quot;The Times&quot; said, to be &quot;Shockingly funny&quot;.

The Donmar Warehouse mounted a season of McPherson&#x27;s work in 2013 with a revival of &quot;The Weir&quot; and the world premiere of &quot;The Night Alive&quot;. &quot;The Weir&quot; was hailed once again as &quot;A modern classic&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;A contemporary classic&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; while &quot;The Night Alive&quot; was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Play and described as &quot;Another triumph&quot; by &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; and &quot;A masterstroke&quot; by &quot;Time Out&quot;. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; said &quot;sees the Irish playwright at his compassionate best.&quot;

&quot;The Night Alive&quot; transferred to the Atlantic Theatre New York, where it was awarded the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play 2014, and also received Best Play nominations from the Drama Desk and Lucille Lortell Awards

McPherson&#x27;s play &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot;, where the dramatic action is broken up by 20 songs by Bob Dylan, opened at London&#x27;s The Old Vic on 26 July 2017. The play is set in a boarding house in 1934 in Duluth, Minnesota, the birthplace of Dylan. The project began when Dylan&#x27;s office approached McPherson and suggested creating a play using Dylan&#x27;s songs. The drama received favourable reviews.

===Screenplays===
The film of his first screenplay, &quot;I Went Down&quot;, was critically acclaimed and a great commercial success.

<text>Thomas Goldwell C. R. (15013 April 1585) was an English Catholic clergyman, Bishop of Saint Asaph, the last of those Catholic bishops who had refused to accept the English Reformation.

==Life==
Thomas Goldwell was the son of William Goldwell of Great Chart, Kent. He is thought to have studied at Canterbury College, Oxford; in January 1532 a student surnamed Goldwell was questioned concerning books in his possession which supported Catherine of Aragon, and Goldwell later referred to Richard Thornden, who was warden of that College from 1524 to 1534, as his &quot;old friend and master&quot;. He graduated BA in 1528, MA on 17 July 1531, and BTh on 20 March 1534. While at Oxford he attained more eminence in mathematics, astronomy, and kindred sciences, than in divinity or the humanities.

He became chaplain to Reginald Pole and lived with him at Rome, where he was appointed of the English Hospital of the Holy Trinity. Goldwell was attainted in 1539.

In 1547 he became a novice in the Theatine House of St. Paul, at Naples. On the death of Paul III, Pole brought him to Rome as his personal attendant at the conclave of 1549-50 that elected of Pope Julius III. Goldwell then returned to Naples, and made his profession as a Theatine. In 1553, while Edward VI was still reigning an Act of General Pardon was passed, from which Goldwell had the signal honour of being specially excepted by name, along with Pole and some others.

On Mary&#x27;s accession, Pole was named papal legate, and Goldwell returned with him to England. In 1555 Goldwell became bishop of St Asaph, a diocese largely within Wales. While still only bishop-designate, he was sent to Rome on 2 July 1555 to report on the state of religion in England to Paul IV, and probably received his episcopal consecration at that time. He returned to England and assisted at the consecration of Pole as Archbishop of Canterbury.

Mary planned to make him Bishop of Oxford and ambassador to Rome in November 1558, and the documents were drawn up, but were not enacted due to her death. When Elizabeth came to the throne, Goldwell attended Pole&#x27;s funeral by the new Queen&#x27;s permission and then returned to St Asaph&#x27;s. He complained of not being invited to her first parliament as a bishop. It was alleged that, by his nomination to Oxford, he was no longer Bishop of St. Asaph; but that, as he had not done homage to the queen for Oxford, he was not yet bishop of that see. Not allowed to perform a bishop&#x27;s office, say Mass, or administer the sacraments, as long as he remained in the country, by June 1559 he decided to leave England. Although the ports were being watched for him, he succeeded in making his escape.

In 1561 Goldwell became superior of the Theatines at San Silvestro, their house in Rome. He served as Custos of the English Hospice in Rome (now called the Venerable English College, Rome) where he went to serve as the only English bishop at the last stages of the council of Trent, (Richard Pate, Bishop of Worcester, and Reginald Pole being at the earlier stages in the 1540s) and in 1562 was again attainted. In the following year he was appointed vicar-general to Carlo Borromeo, archbishop of Milan. Later, he returned to Rome, where he is known to have ordained the famous Spanish composer Tomás Luis de Victoria as a priest. In 1580, in spite of his advanced age, he set out for England at the head of the mission which included Campion and Persons, but he was taken ill at Reims and obliged to return to Rome.

At Pentecost in 1584 he ordained to the priesthood Camillus de Lellis, the founder of the Camillans or Order of Clerks Regular, Ministers of the Sick. St Camillus is the Catholic patron Saint of the Sick, hospitals, nurses and physicians.

Goldwell died in Rome in 1585, the last surviving pre-Reformation bishop of Catholic England.

<text>William Julius Mickle (29 September 1734 – 28 October 1788) was a Scottish poet.

== Biography ==
Born in Langholm on 29 September 1738 to a minister, he was for some time a brewer in Edinburgh, but failed. He moved to England where he worked as a corrector for the Clarendon Press at Oxford. In 1771–75 Mickle lodged at the manor house in Forest Hill, Oxfordshire. Mickle had various literary failures and minor successes until, while at Forest Hill, he produced his translation of the &quot;Lusiad&quot;, from the Portuguese of Luís de Camões. This was a success that brought him both fame and money.

In 1777, he went to Portugal, where he was received with distinction. In 1784, he published the ballad of &quot;Cumnor Hall&quot;, which suggested to Walter Scott the writing of &quot;Kenilworth&quot;. He is perhaps best remembered, however, by the beautiful lyric, &quot;There&#x27;s nae luck aboot the Hoose&quot;, which, although claimed by others, is almost certainly his.

In 1781 Mickle married Mary Tomkins, the daughter of his former landlord in Forest Hill, and settled in Wheatley. He died in 1788 while on a visit to his in-laws in Forest Hill, London, and is buried in Forest Hill churchyard.

His namesake and great-grandson, William Julius Mickle, became a distinguished medical doctor.

<doc id="1098629" wikidata="Q1571740" url="?curid=1098629" title="USS Omaha (CL-4)">
<text>USS &quot;Omaha&quot; (CL-4) was the lead ship of the light cruiser of the United States Navy. She was originally classified as a scout cruiser. She was the second US Navy ship named for the city of Omaha, Nebraska, the first being , a screw sloop launched in 1869.

&quot;Omaha&quot; spent most of her career in the Pacific. At this time her primary mission was training, and she proved to be very capable by consistently winning fleet awards in gunnery and communications. She made many ports-of-call throughout the Pacific, Mediterranean and Caribbean during her peacetime cruises, displaying the Stars and Stripes. In 1941, prior to the US entering the war, she was assigned to Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic, based in Recife, Brazil. Nearly a month before the US entered the war she captured the German blockade runner SS &quot;Odenwald&quot;, for which her crew won an award in salvage from a federal court sitting as a court of admiralty.

After the US entered the war she continued her activities of guarding convoys in the Atlantic between South America and Western Africa. During this time she sank two German blockade runners and was responsible for rescuing many crewmen whose ships had been sunk by Axis submarines and merchant raiders. In 1944, she sailed for the Mediterranean to support Operation Dragoon, the invasion of the south of France. After the war she was quickly deemed surplus and scrapped at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in February 1946.

==Construction and design==


&quot;Omaha&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Todd Dry Dock and Construction Company of Tacoma, Washington, on 6 December 1918. She was launched on 14 December 1920. &quot;Omaha&quot; was sponsored by Louise Bushnell White, a descendant of David Bushnell, the inventor of the first documented submarine to be used in combat, &quot;Turtle&quot;. She was commissioned on 24 February 1923, with Captain David C. Hanrahan in command.

&quot;Omaha&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew during peacetime consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Omaha&quot; was powered by four Westinghouse geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . Though the ship&#x27;s design was intended to provide a range of at a speed of , she only delivered at that speed.

&quot;Omaha&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After the United States entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-inch/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. She carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the midships catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. &quot;Omaha&quot; was also built with the capacity to carry 224 mines.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The conning tower and the deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had one and a half inches of armor. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and splinter damage.

&quot;Omaha&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were Vought VE-9s, then Vought UO-1s, the ship then operated Curtiss SOC Seagulls from 1935, and Vought OS2U Kingfishers after 1940.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Omaha&quot; went through several armament changes. Some of these changes were to save weight, while others were to increase her AA armament. On 8 September 1926, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Edward W. Eberle, along with the Commanders in Chief of the United States Fleet and Battle Fleet, and their subordinate commanding officers, the Secretary of the Navy, Curtis D. Wilbur, ordered that all mines and the tracks for laying the mines be removed from all of the &quot;Omaha&quot;-class cruisers, the working conditions had been found to be very &quot;wet&quot;. In December 1933, while she was undergoing overhaul at Bremerton, her 3-inch AA guns were increased from two to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. The lower torpedo tube mounts, which had also proved to be very wet, were removed and the openings plated over before the start of World War II. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s AA armament was first augmented by three quadruple /75 gun mounts by early 1942, however, these didn&#x27;t prove reliable and were replaced by twin Bofors guns later in the war. At about the same time, she also received 14 Oerlikon cannons.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Omaha&quot; spent most of August 1923, near Puget Sound where she conducted her sea trials. On 6 October, she proceeded to Puget Sound Navy Yard to have her aircraft catapults installed. She then sailed for Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 17 October, where she loaded ammunition for target practice. At the end of November and into early December 1923, &quot;Omaha&quot; conducted &quot;Short Range Battle Practice&quot; with the battleship before joining the Battle Fleet on 8 December.

Not satisfied with ″s suitability as a flagship, Rear Admiral Sumner E. W. Kittelle, Commander Destroyer Squadrons, sought a replacement. &quot;Omaha&quot; was chosen by RADM Kittelle and reported at San Diego, California, 27 December 1923. She only held the post until 14 March 1924.

&quot;Omaha&quot; fell into a routine of operations along the Pacific coast, Central America, and exercises in the Caribbean, with occasional trips to Pearl Harbor. In 1925, she visited Australia and New Zealand, and in 1930, she embarked member of the American Samoa Commission for their Congressional investigation of conditions at Pago Pago. In 1931, she sailed for the Caribbean where she joined in exercises from the end of March until early May. She then transferred to the Atlantic, where she participated in joint maneuvers with the US Army in Hampton Roads, at the end of May. From there she continued in maneuvers at Newport, Hampton Roads, and the Southern Drill Ground. &quot;Omaha&quot; sailed into the Boston Navy Yard at the end of October, where she remained until January when she set sail for her return to the Pacific.

Once again &quot;Omaha&quot; fell into her routine of steaming along the western coast until July 1937. In addition she returned to Panama several times for exercises and fleet problems, operated in Hawaiian waters and around the Aleutian Islands.

====Grounding in the Bahamas====
In July 1937, &quot;Omaha&quot; was serving as flagship of the Special Service Squadron when she was relieved by the year old gunboat . On 19 July, &quot;Omaha&quot; became grounded on a reef at Castle Island, Bahamas, near . During the investigation it was stated that, &quot;she quickly and evenly decelerated as the bottom engaged the smooth reef.&quot; The grounding had occurred during high tide, which made dislodging the cruiser more difficult. After removing as much as possible in an attempt to lighten the ship the salvagers employed tugs to pull on &quot;Omaha&quot; while destroyers circled around them to create waves. After ten days of attempts, on 29 July, &quot;Omaha&quot; was finally floated free. She got underway the following day for the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, where she underwent repairs. A general court martial, held on 11 October 1937, found that Captain Howard B. Mecleary, &quot;Omaha&quot;″s commanding officer at the time of the grounding, was guilty of negligence &quot;resulting in the stranding of the vessel&quot;, he was sentenced to the loss of 25 numbers on the captain&#x27;s list. On 14 February 1938, &quot;Omaha&quot; got underway after having the damage to her hull repaired, with Captain Wallace L. Lind, as her new commanding officer. She conducted sea trials while en route to Guantánamo.

====Germany invades Poland====

&quot;Omaha&quot; set sail for Gibraltar on 30 March 1938, for service in the Mediterranean Sea. Arriving in Marseille, France, 27 April 1938, she would remain in the Mediterranean for over a year, until 2 May 1939. She visited Villefranche-sur-Mer, and Menton, France, during her time before departing from Malta, for her return to the US and an extensive overhaul from 17 June until October 1939. It was during this time that, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, starting what would become World War II.

&quot;Omaha&quot; operated in the Caribbean after her overhaul conducting gunnery and tactical exercise from the end of October until 6 December 1939, when she arrived at Havana. She had been tasked with the duty of transporting the body of J. Butler Wright, the US Ambassador to Cuba, who had died 4 December, to Washington, D.C. Upon completion, &quot;Omaha&quot; reported to Naval Operating Base (NOB), staying there until 1 April 1940. 

On 1 April 1940, set sail for the Philadelphia Navy Yard before getting underway for the Caribbean. She entered San Juan, Puerto Rico, then proceeded to Guantánamo and Havana, before returning again to Philadelphia, 5 May. On 28 May, &quot;Omaha&quot; would return to Norfolk, before leaving on 22 June, for Lisbon, Portugal, and her new assignment as flagship of the temporary Squadron 40-T, which had been formed to protect US civilians and interests in Spain, during the Spanish Civil War.

&quot;Omaha&quot; was to relieve her sister ship in Lisbon. As &quot;Trenton&quot;, returning to the US, and &quot;Omaha&quot; passed each other upon her arrival the two crews cheered and waved. &quot;Omaha&quot;″s band played &quot;Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&quot; while &quot;Trenton&quot;″s musicians responded with &quot;Empty Saddles (in the Old Corral)&quot;. &quot;Omaha&quot; remained near Lisbon, during her service as flagship, until early October 1940, when the squadron was disbanded. On 3 October, she set sail for her return to the US. &quot;Omaha&quot; visited Monrovia, Liberia, on 10 October. During her stay the necessary conditions for modern military training and equipment for the Liberian Frontier Force were set aboard &quot;Omaha&quot; at a meeting of the US admiral David McDougal LeBreton with the Liberian Secretary Clarence Simpson. Her final stop was Pernambuco, Brazil, on 14 October, before making way for NOB the next day, where she arrived 23 October, and remained through 7 November.

From November 1940 until February 1941, &quot;Omaha&quot; was again in the Caribbean for more tactical and gunnery exercises. In February 1941, she entered the New York Navy Yard for overhaul and the installation of a radar system, her first.

&quot;Omaha&quot; got underway 28 April 1941, but engine trouble soon developed and she was forced to return to Brooklyn, for repairs to her No. 4 turbine until 25 June.

Task Force (TF) 3, which was at the time commanded by RADM Jonas H. Ingram, had initiated patrol operations out of the ports of Recife and Bahia, Brazil, on 15 June 1941. &quot;Omaha&quot;, along with three of her sisters, were among the resources that were available for Ingram&#x27;s Southern Atlantic operations, along with five destroyers. On 30 June, with the propulsion and engineering issues having been resolved, &quot;Omaha&quot; steamed out of Brooklyn, to begin her Neutrality Patrols between Brazil and Ascension Island, which was part of the British Overseas Territories at the time. &quot;Omaha&quot; was tasked with enforcing a blockade against Germany by intercepting, boarding, and inspecting vessels that may have been German merchants or agents conducting trade in the region. In addition, she also tasked with escorting and protecting the convoys using the shipping lanes between South American port and the ports in Western Africa, from Axis U-boats and merchant raiders. She visited Montevideo, Uruguay, in addition to Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and although not at war during this time she still operated under war conditions.

====Search for blockade runners====
On 4 November 1941, with the report from the British oiler RFA &quot;Olwen&quot; that a German surface raider had attacked her at , Vice Admiral Algernon Willis, RN, Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic, ordered his heavy cruiser , along with the armed merchant cruiser , to search for the raider. The light cruiser and the special service vessels and were additionally ordered to assist in the search and departed from Freetown, Sierra Leone.

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Canton&quot; separated, with &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; steaming southeast and &quot;Canton&quot; setting an opposite course. &quot;Omaha&quot; and the destroyer , TG 3.6, which were positioned far northwest of the stated siting at that time, were tasked with supporting the Royal Navy ships. and the destroyers and , who were near to the area reported by &quot;Olwen&quot;, were able to search the area, but were unable to locate the &quot;German raider&quot;, while &quot;Omaha&quot; and &quot;Somers&quot;″s search for survivors was also unsuccessful. The search continued the next day.

=====Capture of &quot;Odenwald&quot;=====

Even though the hunt for the &quot;raider&quot; had been unsuccessful it ultimately proved to not be entirely fruitless. On 6 November, as &quot;Omaha&quot; and &quot;Somers&quot; were en route back to Recife, returning from a patrol in the equatorial waters of the Atlantic, smoke was spotted, at 05:06, on the horizon. Captain Theodore E. Chandler, &quot;Omaha&quot;″s commander, put her on an intercept course with the sighting. As &quot;Omaha&quot; approached the ship, which was flying US colors with the name &quot;Willmoto&quot;, out of Philadelphia, identifying her on her stern, she began taking evasive action. While multiple attempts were made to signal the merchant ship, they either went unanswered or they were given suspicious responses. &quot;Omaha&quot;″s lookouts also reported that many of the crew visible on the deck of the ship were &quot;uniquely un-American in appearance.&quot;

The ship, which identified herself as &quot;Willmoto&quot;, did not satisfactorily identify herself to the American warships. After ordering &quot;Willmoto&quot; to heave to, &quot;Omaha&quot;″s captain dispatched an armed boarding party. At 05:37 Lieutenant George K. Carmichael, along with the boarding party, began to make way for the vessel. Around this time, the merchant hoisted the signal flags &quot;Fox Mike&quot;, indicating that the ship was sinking and that they required assistance. Two distinct explosions could be heard within the ship when the boarding party began to climbing the ship&#x27;s ladder. In an attempt to leave the sinking ship, several of the crew had lowered lifeboats, but Lt. Carmichael ordered them to return to the ship. At 05:58, Carmichael signaled to &quot;Omaha&quot; that the ship was indeed a German ship and that the crew had attempted to scuttle her. She was identified as &quot;Odenwald&quot;, a German blockade runner and that her holds were filled with of rubber, along with 103 B. F. Goodrich truck tires and sundry other cargo that totaled total.

A diesel engine specialist was brought over from &quot;Somers&quot;″s crew to assist with the repairs and prevent &quot;Odenwald&quot;″s sinking. &quot;Omaha&quot;″s SOC floatplanes and &quot;Somers&quot; guarded the area while the boarding party made &quot;Odenwald&quot; sea worthy. With repairs finished the three ships set course for Port of Spain, Trinidad, to avoid possible difficulties with the government of Brazil.

&quot;Omaha&quot; arrived at Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with &quot;Odenwald&quot; flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. On the following day, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, the United States sued the &quot;Odenwald,&quot; on its own behalf as well as that of the &quot;Omaha&#x27;s&quot; crew, seeking an award for marine salvage services.
 Judgment for salvors did not come until April 30, 1947. The court awarded the United States $72, 212.40 in compensation and expenses. Members of the &quot; Omaha&#x27;s&quot; boarding party each won $3000, and the remainder of her crew won two months’ pay and allowances. The judgment was affirmed on appeal.

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;Omaha&quot; was steaming with &quot;Somers&quot; from San Juan to Recife, when she received a communication that informed her captain that the Japanese had attacked the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. She was ordered to &quot;execute WPL (war plan) 46 (Rainbow 5) against Japan.&quot; Captain Chandler the crew to read them the message. On 8 December, the US Congress would officially declare war on Japan with Germany declaring war on the US three days later, on 11 December 1941.

====Merchant sinkings====
While &quot;Omaha&quot; was on patrol with &quot;Jouett&quot; on 8 May 1942, she came across the Swedish ship &quot;Astri&quot;. &quot;Omaha&quot;″s boarding party found Ensign John F. Kelly, USNR, from the US freighter , along with six members of her armed guard detachment and eight crewmen. She had been sunk on 23 April, by (Kapitänleutnnt Ulrich Folkers) southeast of Bermuda. The men had drifted for two days before being picked up. The Office of Naval Operations (OpNav) had informed &quot;Omaha&quot; that they suspected the Swedish ship of being a tender for German U-boats. &quot;Jouett&quot; was left to investigate &quot;Astri&quot; while &quot;Omaha&quot; set a course to Recife, with the survivors of &quot;Lammot Du Pont&quot;. Having been pointed to the area by a patrolling aircraft, the destroyer was able to rescue another 23 survivors from &quot;Lammot Du Pont&quot; on 16 May.

&quot;Omaha&quot; spotted a light on the horizon at 01:30, on 1 June 1942. The light was from a small lifeboat with eight surviving crewmen aboard from the sunken British merchant &quot;Charlbury&quot;. She had been heading to Buenos Aires, Argentina, when she had been attacked on 28 May, by the . The first torpedo fired by &quot;Barbarigo&quot; had missed &quot;Charlbury&quot;, at which point the submarine surfaced to attack with her deck guns before submerging again. With her second torpedo attack &quot;Barbarigo&quot; struck &quot;Charlbury&quot; which caused the merchant to sink by the stern. &quot;Omaha&quot; went on to pull another 32 survivors of the sinking from the water and transported all of them to Recife.

On 8 June 1942, only a week later, eight British seamen, from the British merchant &quot;Harpagon&quot;, where found aboard the Argentinian merchantman &quot;Rio Diamante&quot; by &quot;Omaha&quot;. They were the only survivors, 41 had died in the 20 April, attack by (Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Bleichrodt) near the island of Bermuda. The survivors, being adrift for 35 days, stayed in &quot;Rio Diamante&quot;, which transported them to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In a two-day period, 16–17 August 1942, five Brazilian merchantmen were sunk by (Korvettenkapitän Harro Schact). More than 500 men had been killed in these attacks on Brazilian shipping which were outside of the territorial waters of Brazil. &quot;U-507&quot; then destroyed a sixth vessel on 19 August, that was flying Brazilian colors. On 22 August 1942, while &quot;Omaha&quot; was waiting for her harbor pilot to take her in at Montevideo, Uruguay, her crew were able to observe the rusting hulk of the that had been scuttled almost three years earlier on 18 December 1939, after the Battle of the River Plate. When &quot;Omaha&quot; had moored, a Brazilian naval officer visited Captain Chandler and informed him Brazil was preparing for a formal declaration of war against both Germany and Italy. The declaration was promulgated that day.

====Hazards of life at sea====
Even as the threat from Germany and Italy had diminished by August 1942, there were still many ways for the men of &quot;Omaha&quot; to be harmed. One day, as she was at anchor in Carenage Bay, Trinidad, one of her sailors had returned from an especially &quot;hard liberty&quot; and found a spot on &quot;Omaha&quot;″s direction finder deck to sleep off the effects. When the ship rolled unexpectedly the inebriated sailor rolled from the deck, down an awning, across the quarterdeck and then over the side and into the water. According to Captain Chandler, &quot;probably due to his perfectly relaxed condition&quot;, the sailor was uninjured. Other such occurrences did not always end as well.

On 30 October 1942, while in Trinidad, six of &quot;Omaha&quot;″s baseball team were injured when one of the sides of the truck carrying them fell off. Just six days later, while &quot;Omaha&quot; and were on escort duty, one of her newly arrived Vought OS2U Kingfishers flipped upon landing, while the aviator was able to make it out safely, the plane sustained serious damage which required it to need overhauling when &quot;Omaha&quot; put back into port.

Tragedy did strike &quot;Marblehead&quot; though in November 1942. As her whaleboat was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell overboard and failed to ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that &quot;Omaha&quot;″s boarding party&#x27;s return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective even though they were more cumbersome and bulky.

====Collision with &quot;Milwaukee&quot;====

The year 1943 proved to be quiet for &quot;Omaha&quot;. Escorting the stores ship regularly out of Recife, and patrolling the southern Atlantic with her sister ships , &quot;Memphis&quot;, , and the destroyer , she did not come in contact with any enemy ships or submarines or the aftermath of their attacks.

The only damage she took that year occurred 30 April 1943, while she was changing stations on formation, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; struck &quot;Omaha&quot;″s starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. &quot;Omaha&quot;″s damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses and were able to stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On &quot;Milwaukee&quot;, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.

====Sinking of &quot;Rio Grande&quot; and &quot;Burgenland&quot;====
&quot;Omaha&quot;″s time of relatively ordinary operations came to an end very early in 1944. While patrolling out of Recife, with &quot;Jouett&quot; on 4 January, one of &quot;Omaha&quot;″s aircraft spotted a ship about northeast of the Brazilian coast. &quot;Omaha&quot; challenged the vessel at 10:20, with one of her searchlights, that produced no response from the unknown contact. Lookouts were able to spot two guns mounted on the ship&#x27;s bow though, and soon after a large cloud of heavy smoke was observed coming from the stern of the ship, indicating that her crew were probably in the process of scuttling the ship to avoid capture. As &quot;Omaha&quot; pulled along the unknown ship&#x27;s port side she began to fire with her starboard battery as &quot;Jouett&quot; also began firing. The ship&#x27;s crew were then observed attempting to escape off her stern in lifeboats. &quot;Omaha&quot; crew tried to force the sailors back aboard with machine gun fire, but it became clear that the vessel was not salvageable. &quot;Omaha&quot; began firing on the vessel again, which soon sank by her stern. With fears that this surface action may have alerted enemy U-boats in the area, &quot;Omaha&quot; and &quot;Jouett&quot; withdrew without picking up any of the survivors. The ship was later identified as a German blockade runner named &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. &quot;Marblehead&quot; was able to rescue 72 survivors later on 8 January.

&quot;Omaha&quot; returned the following day to the vicinity that &quot;Rio Grande&quot; had been sunk and again encountered an unknown merchant steamer. She once again challenged the unknown contact with her searchlight, and again received no response to her signals. This time &quot;Omaha&quot; fired two warning shots over the unknown ship&#x27;s bow, due to the fact that it appeared that she was dead in the water. An explosion was observed, followed by smoke billowing from her. Captain Elwood M. Tillson ordered &quot;Omaha&quot;″s 6-inch battery to train on the unknown contact and open fire. Captain Tillson then allowed members of the crew to rotate topside to observe the gunfire since many of the men were unable to view the action against &quot;Rio Grande&quot; the previous day. The ship, later identified as another German blockade runner, &quot;Burgenland&quot;, sank by her stern thirty minutes later. Two days later 21 of her survivors were rescued by &quot;Davis&quot; with able to retrieve an additional 35 crewmen on 8 January.

====Recovery of &quot;U-177&quot; survivors====
&quot;Omaha&quot; was out patrolling with &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Jouett&quot; on 6 February 1944, when the ships were given orders to be on the lookout for the survivors of a U-boat that had been sunk earlier in the day near their location. A yellow life raft was later spotted by &quot;Omaha&quot;″s lookouts. The occupants were German sailors that had survived the sinking of their boat, , that had been sunk by a Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator from Bombing Squadron (VB) 107 that was operating out of Ascension Island. &quot;U-177&quot; had been sitting on the surface while some of the crew were sunning and swimming.

According to Leutnant zur See Hans-Otto Brodt, their commanding officer Korvettenkapitän Heinz Bucholz and another 50 men of the crew of 64, went down with the ship. The prisoners were sent to the sick bay for treatment of shock and exposure and supplied with fresh clothing that had been provided by the Red Cross. Until &quot;Omaha&quot; put in at Bahia, on 15 February, where they debarked and were transported to Recife, the Germans were placed under armed guard.

====Transfer to the European Theater====
On 4 July 1944, &quot;Omaha&quot; got underway to the European Theater with destroyer escorts , , and troop transport . On 13 July, the convoy arrived at Gibraltar, with the addition of , , and the destroyer . &quot;Omaha&quot; set sail for Palermo, Sicily, on 18 July, in company with the battleships and .

=====Operation Dragoon=====

On 7 August 1944, &quot;Omaha&quot; was guarding the flank of a formation consisting of the US heavy cruisers and , the battleship &quot;Nevada&quot; and the , bombarding Toulon, France. &quot;Omaha&quot; assisted in the bombardment firing 24 rounds. An enemy shore battery began firing on &quot;Omaha&quot; at 17:17, &quot;Quincy&quot; was able to lay a smoke screen out for her while she fired rockets in an attempt to jam their radar. Again on 20 August, while she was supporting &quot;Nevada&quot;, she once again drew fire from the enemy as she was departing from the area with the shells splashing off her stern and off of her port quarter.

Shortly after, while she was at Porquerolles, France, &quot;Omaha&quot; responded to the net tender , that had come under fire from a German shore battery, by firing 73 6-inch rounds into the enemy position.

&quot;Omaha&quot; departed the assault area on 27 August 1944, and returned to Palermo, before getting underway to Oran, Algeria, with &quot;Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;Marblehead&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, and the destroyer . This group then sailed from Oran, on 1 September, after being joined by , for the Atlantic. When the formation exited the Mediterranean, &quot;Marblehead&quot; detached from the group and proceeded west independently.

After &quot;Omaha&quot; returned to Bahia, 9 September, she once again resumed her previous duties of patrolling the southern Atlantic and providing escort services. A break in this routine occurred when she returned to the North Atlantic while escorting the transport in company with the Brazilian s and to Gibraltar. They reached their destination on 4 December, where &quot;Omaha&quot; handed her escort duty off to . She then proceeded by herself to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where she arrived on 14 December, and put in the next day to the New York Navy Yard. &quot;Omaha&quot; ended 1944 in New York, while undergoing repairs and alterations that would improve the living spaces for her crew.

====Search for the Brazilian cruiser &quot;Bahia&quot;====
When the (C.12) was reported sunk by a submarine, &quot;Omaha&quot; set out from Recife, on 8 July 1945, on a search and rescue operation. A report came in from the British steamer &quot;Balfe&quot; that they had picked up 33 survivors from &quot;Bahia&quot;. &quot;Omaha&quot; set course to intercept &quot;Balfe&quot; so she could transfer her medical staff and aid in treatment of the remaining survivors. In all, only 44 sailors were rescued, with seven dying from their injuries, and eight bodies recovered, out of a crew of 346. An investigation into the sinking of &quot;Bahia&quot; later determined that on 4 July 1945, while conducting anti-aircraft training, a gunner that had shot down a trailing target kite continued to fire as he was trailing the target&#x27;s descent. Because the proper safety stops had not been installed on the gun he was able to inadvertently fire into a rack of live depth charges that were positioned on the fantail of the ship.

==Decommissioning==
Following the sinking of &quot;Bahia&quot;, &quot;Omaha&quot; continued to serve in the South Atlantic, until 12 August, two days after the Japanese announced their intention of surrendering under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, when she departed Recife, for the last time. She made ports of call at San Juan and Norfolk, before getting underway for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Soon after arriving in Philadelphia, a Board of Inspection and Survey recommended that &quot;Omaha&quot; be taken out of commission. 
&quot;Omaha&quot; was decommissioned on 1 November 1945, and was struck from the Navy Register on 28 November 1945. She was scrapped at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard by February 1946.

<doc id="1098630" wikidata="Q1857814" url="?curid=1098630" title="The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)">
<text>&quot;The Power of Love&quot; is a 1984 single released by British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood which was written by Holly Johnson, Peter Gill, Mark O&#x27;Toole and Brian Nash. It was released on 19 November 1984 as the third single from the album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (1984).

The song has long been regarded as a Christmas song, despite having no reference to Christmas within the song lyrics. However, the accompanying video features the Nativity of Jesus, and the single cover was The Assumption of the Virgin. The single spent one week at number one in the United Kingdom, being outsold only by &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid.

==Background==

The track was first featured during the John Peel sessions the band performed on during 1983, which was slower and emphasised the track&#x27;s original camp ironic content (such as the Hooded Claw from the cartoon series &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;). After recording at the original speed, ZTT/Trevor Horn sped it up, this also caused a change in pitch. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; became Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s third consecutive (and last) UK number 1 single in December 1984. To commemorate the Christmas release, Godley &amp; Creme directed a Nativity-themed video for the single, filmed outside Jerusalem, and the artwork for the single also used traditional Christian iconography. The original showing of the video on &quot;The Tube&quot; featured the Nativity occupying the whole screen, however the borders of band members were added for later showings due to pressure from UK broadcasters.

The 12&quot; mix of the song featured actor Chris Barrie aping DJ Mike Read&#x27;s banning of the single &quot;Relax&quot;, as well as his impression of Ronald Reagan, instructing the listener in prayer. The single also featured a Christmas message from the band, entitled &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot;.

On the cover is a reproduction of the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; by Titian, a 16th-century painting in the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari of Venice. The single has been reissued in various formats over the years. The 1993 reissue charted at number 10 in the UK; the 2000 remix version reached number 6.

Holly Johnson, who co-wrote the song, later reminisced: &quot;I always felt like &#x27;The Power of Love&#x27; was the record that would save me in this life. There is a biblical aspect to its spirituality and passion; the fact that love is the only thing that matters in the end&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Power of Love&quot; followed its two predecessors, &quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Two Tribes&quot;, to the top of the UK singles chart. It scored the band an early December number-one. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was also a top 10 hit in several European countries, in Australia and New Zealand, and in Canada. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; is often regarded as a Christmas song, despite having no reference to Christmas within the song lyrics. However, the accompanying video features the Nativity of Jesus, and the single cover was The Assumption of the Virgin. The single spent just one week at number one in the UK, outsold by the charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; by Band Aid, which until 1997 was the best selling single ever in the UK.

Since then, reissues and/or remixes of the Frankie Goes to Hollywood recording of this song have been top 10 UK hits on two other occasions, hitting number 10 in 1993 and number 6 in 2000. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; has also charted in the UK in a version by Holly Johnson (a solo recording from 1999). The original version by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was featured in the 2012 film &quot;Sightseers&quot;, the same year that the song was reissued as a digital download and peaked at number 42, in response to a cover version by Gabrielle Aplin. Her recording of the song also went to number 1 in the UK, exactly 28 years after the original Frankie Goes to Hollywood single topped the chart. A version sung by Connie Lush appears on the album &#x27;Liverpool- The Number Ones Album&#x27; 2008 compilation which is top top version.

==Critical reception==
Richard Harris from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;The Power of Love&#x27; is too straight-laced (sic), but still drips with deep-pile quality (Holly Johnson had one of the great pop voices, don&#x27;t forget)&quot;.

==Holly Johnson version==

Holly Johnson, former singer of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, recorded his own version of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; for his third studio album, &quot;Soulstream&quot; (1999). It was released as the third single from the album on 13 December 1999 and reached number 56 in the UK Singles Chart.

===Background===
Johnson was inspired to re-record &quot;The Power of Love&quot; as he felt that the Frankie Goes to Hollywood original was &quot;too pompous and too much like one of those anthemic Queen songs&quot;. He told the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; in 1999, &quot;I wanted to record a version which was more from the heart, one which was more me and more in keeping with my personal taste, but it wasn&#x27;t a question of trying to better it.&quot;

===Music video===
The song&#x27;s original music video contained stock footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, which Johnson included as a tribute as he felt she &quot;embodies love&quot; and &quot;brought so much love and hope to so many people in her life and death&quot;. The video was subsequently withdrawn after &quot;several major TV shows expressed nervousness at the Princess Diana content&quot;. A new edit was then released, removing the footage of Diana and adding in additional live performance footage of Johnson.

Upon its release, Jon Perks of the &quot;Sunday Mercury&quot; criticised the single as a &quot;Christmas cash-in&quot; and noted, &quot;Apart from the slightly altered spoken opener and a crisper sound, there&#x27;s virtually nothing to separate it from the original.&quot; In a retrospective review of &quot;Soulstream&quot;, Jon O&#x27;Brien of AllMusic called the song an &quot;unnecessary reworking&quot; that &quot;only highlight[s] the creative rut he appeared to be stuck in.&quot;

==Gabrielle Aplin version==
In 2012, British singer-songwriter Gabrielle Aplin released a cover version of the song produced by Mike Spencer and David Kosten. It was released on 9 November 2012 as a digital download as the lead single from her debut studio album &quot;English Rain&quot; (2013). The song was selected as the soundtrack to the John Lewis 2012 Christmas advertisement. The song was also used during an episode of &quot;&quot; on 16 November 2012 after the sudden death of one of the show&#x27;s main characters, and Mary and Francis’s wedding in the TV show, &quot;Reign&quot;. The song subsequently became popular in Australia in early 2014.

===Music video===
A music video to accompany the release of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was first released onto YouTube on 9 November 2012. It shows Aplin in a room in a large house, playing a piano. Then, near the end of the video, fairy lights in the room light up. The video was directed by Alexander Brown.

===Release history===
==Dalton Harris version==
In 2018, the Jamaican-British singer Dalton Harris, a contestant and eventual winner of the 15th series of the UK TV talent competition programme &quot;The X Factor&quot;, released the song as his winning song from the series. The song was in association with and featuring additional vocals by the same series&#x27; 9th season winner James Arthur, making it the second time the winning song UK &quot;X Factor&quot; is promoted as a duet or group performance rather than a solo performance by the winner, after the winners of 2017 when Rak-Su duetted with Wyclef Jean and Naughty Boy for their single entitled &quot;Dimelo&quot;.

As in many earlier &quot;X Factor&quot;-winning releases, VAT collected on sales of the &quot;X Factor&quot; winner&#x27;s charity song will be donated to children&#x27;s charities, Together for Short Lives and Shooting Star Chase, declared the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond. The UK Department of Health and Social Care will make the donation of the VAT on the UK government&#x27;s behalf. This is reportedly &quot;The X Factor UK&quot;&#x27;s 11th charity release.

German band Oomph! also covered the song for their best-of album &quot;Delikatessen&quot;. Feeder also covered the song in 2002.

<doc id="1098635" wikidata="Q8011926" url="?curid=1098635" title="William Henry Channing">
<text>William Henry Channing (May 25, 1810 – December 23, 1884) was an American Unitarian clergyman, writer and philosopher.

==Early life==
William Henry Channing was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Channing&#x27;s father, Francis Dana Channing, died when he was an infant, and responsibility for the young man&#x27;s education was assumed by his uncle, William Ellery Channing, the pre-eminent Unitarian theologian of the early nineteenth century. His other uncles included physician and Harvard professor Walter Channing, and Harvard professor of rhetorici Edward Tyrrel Channing. His grandfather was William Channing, Attorney General of Rhode Island.

Channing graduated from Harvard College in 1829 and from Harvard Divinity School in 1833. 

== Career ==
Channing was ordained and installed over the Unitarian church in Cincinnati in 1835. He became warmly interested in the schemes of Charles Fourier and others for social reorganization. He moved to Boston about 1847, afterward to Rochester, New York and to New York City, where, both as preacher and editor, he became a leader in a movement of Christian socialism. As an early supporter of the socialistic movement in the United States, he was editor of the &quot;Present&quot;, the &quot;Spirit of the Age&quot; and the &quot;Harbinger&quot;. In 1848 he presided over The Religious Union of Associationists in Boston, a socialist group which included many members of the Brook Farm commune.

Channing took active part in the early years of the woman’s rights movement. He signed the call for and attended the first National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1850, where he was appointed to the National Women’s Rights Central Committee. As minister of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester in 1852, he influenced Susan B. Anthony, a member of his congregation who was a young schoolteacher on the threshold of her career as a women&#x27;s rights activist. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony&#x27;s close friend and co-worker, said in her autobiography that, &quot;She [Anthony] first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her.&quot; Channing wrote the call for and played a leading role in the Women&#x27;s Rights Convention that Anthony organized in Rochester in 1853. The convention launched a petition campaign for equal legal and voting rights for women, for which Channing wrote the petitions and, with Ernestine Rose, addressed a select committee of the New York Senate in February 1854.

Between 1854-1857, Channing was minister at Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool, England. In 1857, he succeeded James Martineau as minister of the Hope Street Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool, England. At the commencement of the American Civil War, he returned (1862) and took charge of the Unitarian church in Washington, D. C. William Henry Channing, along with the younger Ellery Channing, was a Transcendentalist. He was a prolific writer, contributing to the &quot;North American Review&quot;, the &quot;Dial&quot;, the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot;, and other serials, a member of the Transcendental Club, a close friend of Henry David Thoreau and corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Among his inspirational writings, one piece, his &quot;Symphony&quot;, is well-known:

:&quot;To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly, talk gently, await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common — this is my symphony.&quot;
Channing was, in 1863 and 1864, the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. He died in London.

==Personal life==
Channing was married to Julia Maria Allen. Their children include the author and poet, Blanche Mary Channing, and Francis Channing, 1st Baron Channing of Wellingborough. He died in London.

<text>In organic chemistry, a methine group or methine bridge is a trivalent functional group , derived formally from methane. It consists of a carbon atom bound by two single bonds and one double bond, where one of the single bonds is to a hydrogen. The group is also called methyne or methene, but its IUPAC systematic name is methylylidene or methanylylidene.

This group is sometimes called &quot;methylidyne&quot;, however that name belongs properly to either the methylidyne group (connected to the rest of the molecule by a triple bond) or to the methylidyne radical (the two atoms as a free molecule with dangling bonds).

The name &quot;methine&quot; is also widely used in non-systematic nomenclature for the methanetriyl group (IUPAC): a carbon atom with four single bonds, where one bond is to a hydrogen atom ().

==Overlapping methines==
Two or more methine bridges can overlap, forming a chain or ring of carbon atoms connected by alternating single and double bonds, as in piperylene , or the compound

Every carbon atom in this molecule is a methine carbon atom, except for three; two that are attached to the two nitrogen atoms and not to any hydrogen atoms, and the carbon attached to the nitrogen atom, which is attached to two hydrogen atoms (far right). There is a five-carbon-atom poly-methine chain in the center of this molecule. 

Chains of alternating single and double bonds often form conjugated systems. When closed, as in benzene , they often give aromatic character to the compound.

<text>Hugh Miller (10 October 1802 – 23/24 December 1856) was a Scottish geologist, writer and folklorist.

== Life and work ==
Miller was born in Cromarty, the first of three children of Harriet Wright (&quot;bap&quot;. 1780, &quot;d&quot;. 1863) and Hugh Miller (&quot;bap&quot;. 1754, &quot;d&quot;. 1807), a shipmaster in the coasting trade. Both parents were from trading and artisan families in Cromarty. His father died in a shipwreck in 1807, and he was brought up by his mother and uncles. He was educated in a parish school where he reportedly showed a love of reading. It was at this school that Miller was involved in an altercation with an Afro-Caribbean classmate in which he stabbed his thigh. Miller was subsequently expelled from the school following an unrelated incident. At 17 he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and his work in quarries, together with walks along the local shoreline, led him to the study of geology. In 1829 he published a volume of poems, and soon afterwards became involved in political and religious controversies, first connected to the Reform Bill, and then with the division in the Church of Scotland which led to the Disruption of 1843.

In 1834 he became accountant in one of the local banks, and in the next year brought out his &quot;Scenes and Legends in the North of Scotland&quot;. In 1837 he married the children&#x27;s author Lydia Mackenzie Falconer Fraser. In 1840 the popular party in the Church, with which he had been associated, started a newspaper, the Witness, and Miller was called to be editor in Edinburgh, a position which he retained until the end of his life. He was an influential writer and speaker in the early Free Church. From 1846 he was joined at &quot;The Witness&quot; by Rev James Aitken Wylie.

Among his geological works are &quot;The Old Red Sandstone&quot; (1841), &quot;Footprints of the Creator&quot; (1850), &quot;The Testimony of the Rocks&quot; (1857), &quot;Sketch-book of Popular Geology&quot;. Of these books, perhaps &quot;The Old Red Sandstone&quot; was the best known. The Old Red Sandstone is still a term used to collectively describe sedimentary rocks deposited as a result of the Caledonian orogeny in the late Silurian, Devonian and earliest part of the Carboniferous period.

Miller held that the Earth was of great age, and that it had been inhabited by many species which had come into being and gone extinct, and that these species were homologous; although he believed the succession of species showed progress over time, he did not believe that later species were descended from earlier ones. He denied the Epicurean theory that new species occasionally budded from the soil, and the Lamarckian theory of development of species, as lacking evidence. He argued that all this showed the direct action of a benevolent Creator, as attested in the Bible – the similarities of species are manifestations of types in the Divine Mind; he accepted the view of Thomas Chalmers that Genesis begins with an account of geological periods, and does not mean that each of them is a day; Noah&#x27;s Flood was a limited subsidence of the Middle East. Geology, to Miller, offered a better version of the argument from design than William Paley could provide, and answered the objections of sceptics, by showing that living species did not arise by chance or by impersonal law.

In a biographical review about him, he was recognized as an exceptional person by Sir David Brewster, who said of him:
== Illness and death ==
For most of 1856, Miller had severe headaches and mental distress, and the most probable diagnosis is of psychotic depression. Victorian medicine did not help. He feared that he might harm his wife or children because of persecutory delusions.

Miller died by suicide, shooting himself in the chest with a revolver in his house, Shrub Mount, Portobello, on the night of 23/24 December 1856. That night he had finished checking printers&#x27; proofs for his book on geology and Christianity, &quot;The Testimony of the Rocks&quot;. Before his death, he wrote a poem called &quot;Strange but True.&quot; He died on 24 December 1856.

== Legacy ==
Though he had no academic credentials, he is today considered one of Scotland&#x27;s most influential Victorian palaeontologists, particularly in communicating science to a wider audience. Miller made many new discoveries, including several Silurian sea scorpions (the eurypterid genus &quot;Hughmilleria&quot; was named in his honour), and many Devonian fishes, including several placoderms (the arthrodire &quot;Millerosteus&quot; also honoured him), described in his popular books. The fossil cypress &quot;Hughmillerites&quot;, and the parareptile &quot;Milleretta&quot; were also named after him. 
The BP-operated Miller oilfield in the North Sea was named after Hugh Miller. Hugh Miller Place, a street in the Stockbridge Colonies area of Edinburgh, is named in his honour.

Miller&#x27;s wife Lydia played a major role in editing and securing posthumous publication of compilations as books of many of his Witness articles and public addresses, thus gaining for him a continued wider readership for another 50 years after his death. His second daughter, Harriet Miller Davidson was a published poet who married a clergyman after her father&#x27;s suicide. She moved to Adelaide where her husband was a minister and she published poems and stories in both countries about temperance and of daughters left by inspirational fathers.

There is a bust of Hugh Miller in the Hall of Heroes at the Wallace Monument in Stirling. His home in Cromarty is open as a geological museum, with specimens collected in the immediate area; a weekend event at the site in 2008 was part of celebrations marking the bicentenary of the Geological Society of London.

The Hugh Miller Trail starts at a small car park on a minor road just past Eathie Mains, about south of Cromarty, and leads about down a steep slope through woodland to the foreshore at Eathie Haven on the Moray Firth, where Miller began collecting fossils. It was here that he found his first fossil ammonite, in Jurassic rocks. The haven was originally a salmon fishing station, and a former fishermen&#x27;s bothy, open to the public, has a display board about the geology of the area and Miller&#x27;s fossil discoveries.

<text>Hetepheres II (born 2600 BC) was a queen of ancient Egypt during the 4th Dynasty.

==Biography==
=== Birth and family ===
Queen Hetepheres II may have been one of the longest-lived members of the royal family of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, which lasted from ca. 2723 to 2563 BC. She was a daughter of Khufu and was either born during the reign of her grandfather Sneferu or during the early years of her father&#x27;s reign. She was named after her grandmother, Hetepheres I and she had an aunt named Hetepheres A. A fragmentary titulature found in the tomb of Meritites I may indicate that she was the mother of Hetepheres II.
;Titles of Hetepheres II
*Daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Khufu (&quot;zat-nesut-biti-Khufu,&quot; &quot; &quot;)
*King’s beloved daughter of his body (&quot;zat-nesut-khetef-meretef, &quot;)
*King’s Daughter (&quot;zat-nesut, &quot;)
*King’s wife (&quot;hemet-nesut, &quot;)
*King’s wife, his beloved (&quot;hemet-nesut-meretef, &quot;)
*Beholder of Horus and Seth, (&quot;maat-hor-setesh, -&quot;)
*Follower of Horus (&quot;xt &quot;)
*Intimate of Horus (&quot;Tist &quot;)
*Companion of Horus (&quot;semer[et]-hor,&quot; &quot;[] &quot;)
*Consort of him who is beloved of the Two Ladies (&quot;semayet-meret-nebti, &quot;)
*Great favorite (&quot; Hts&quot;)
*Controller of the butchers of the acacia house (&quot;kherep-seshem-shendjet, [tyw] &quot;)
*Priestess of Thoth (&quot;hemet-netjer-djehuti, &quot;)
*Priestess of Bapefy (&quot;hemet-netjer-bapef, &quot;)
*Priestess of Tjasep (&quot; TA-sp&quot;)

=== Marriages ===
During the reign of Khufu, Hetepheres II married her brother, the Crown Prince Kawab, with whom she had at least one child, a daughter named Meresankh III. After the death of her first husband, she married another of her brothers, Djedefre who later succeeded Khufu as king of Egypt.

She was widowed a second time when Djedefre died. The marriage of her daughter, Meresankh III, to her late second husband&#x27;s successor Khafre made Hetepheres II the mother-in-law of the new king. She would later out-live Meresankh III. A mark of her affection for Meresankh III may be seen in the fact that Hetepheres II had her own mastaba in the eastern cemetery of Giza converted into a tomb for her daughter&#x27;s use. Hetepheres II herself was probably buried in tomb G7350 even though she possessed a joint tomb with her first husband, Kawab (G7110 and 7120 respectively).

While marriage within the royal family was common, multiple marriages to this extent was not. It has been suggested her subsequent marriage to Djedefre was honorary in nature and done in order to maintain her position at court. She never produced an heir to the throne in her second marriage and was never given the title of &quot;King&#x27;s Mother&quot;.

Hetepheres finally died early in the reign of Shepseskaf, the son and successor of Menkaura, and had thus witnessed the reigns of at least five and perhaps six (if she was born during the reign of Sneferu) pharaohs of the fourth Dynasty.

==Children==
===Children of Hetepheres II and Kawab===

* Duaenhor dwA n Hr (Manuel de Codage: &quot;dwAnHr&quot;) – &quot;King’s son of his body&quot;, &quot;Companion of his father&quot;. Buried in G 7550.
* Kaemsekhem kA m sxm (Manuel de Codage: &quot;kAmsxm&quot;) – &quot;King’s son&quot;, &quot;Director of the Palace&quot;. The wife of Kaemsekhem is named Ka&#x27;aper kA a:p*r (Manuel de Codage: &quot;kAapr&quot;). He may be the father of Rawer and Minkhaf. His tomb was located in Giza: G 7660.
* Mindjedef – &quot;King’s son of his body&quot;, &quot;Hereditary prince&quot;, &quot;Treasurer of the King of Lower Egypt&quot;, etc. His wife was named Khufu-ankh. His tomb is located in Giza: G 7760.
* Meresankh III – Wife of Khafre.

===Children of Hetepheres II and Djedefre===

* Neferhetepes nfr Htp s (Manuel de Codage: &quot;nfrHtps&quot;) – It has been suggested that this daughter named Neferhetepes was the mother of King Userkaf.

<text>Thomas Miller (31 August 1807 – 24 October 1874) was an English poet and novelist who explored rural subjects. He was one of the most prolific English working-class writers of the 19th century and produced in all over 45 volumes, including some &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; on urban crime.

==Early life==
Miller was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the son of George Miller, an unsuccessful wharfinger and ship-owner, who deserted his wife and two sons in 1810. Thomas grew up in Sailors Alley, Gainsborough. His childhood friends included the future poet and journalist Thomas Cooper. He attended the White Hart Charity School. Although he left school at nine, he became a voracious reader. His love of the countryside was reinforced by summers spent on his grandfather&#x27;s farm.

Miller found work as a ploughboy, then as a shoemaker&#x27;s apprentice, but he was released from his indentures after he threw &quot;an iron instrument&quot; at his vicious and tyrannical master. He was then apprenticed as a basket-maker to his stepfather.

When Miller had completed his apprenticeship, he moved to Nottingham in 1831 to set up a basket-making business. There he published his first writings, &quot;Songs of the Sea Nymphs&quot; (1832), which he dedicated to Lady Blessington. &quot;Godfrey Malvern&quot; (1842) has been called &quot;his most interesting novel... telling the story of a poor schoolmaster who enters the London literary world.&quot;
==London poverty==
After moving to London he was befriended by Lady Blessington and by Samuel Rogers, and for a time engaged in business as a bookseller, but was unsuccessful and then devoted himself exclusively to literature, producing over 45 volumes, including novels, in which he successfully delineated rural characters and scenes. Among them were &quot;Royston Gower&quot; (1838), &quot;Gideon Giles the Roper&quot;, &quot;Rural Sketches&quot; and &quot;Pictures of Country Life&quot;, illustrated by Samuel Williams. He contributed a series to the run of &quot;penny dreadfuls&quot; entitled &quot;The Mysteries of London&quot;, which depict urban crime.

Although Miller attracted some patronage and some sums from the Royal Literary Fund, he was often in financial need. He appealed directly to Charles Dickens for assistance in 1851, but Dickens declined and wrote to his friend Bulwer Lytton, &quot;I fear he [Miller] has mistaken his vocation.&quot;

Miller had a wife and four children: Henry, George, Emma and Ellen. He died of a stroke at his home at 24 New Street, Kensington, on 24 October 1874 and was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. He was survived by one of his sons and his two spinster daughters.

<doc id="1098645" wikidata="Q209397" url="?curid=1098645" title="Djedefre">
<text>Djedefre (also known as Djedefra and Radjedef; died 2558 BC) was an ancient Egyptian king (pharaoh) of the 4th Dynasty during the Old Kingdom. He is well known by the Hellenized form of his name Rhatoisēs (Ῥατοίσης) by Manetho. Djedefre was the son and immediate throne successor of Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza; his mother is not known for certain. He is the king who introduced the royal title &quot;Sa-Rê&quot; (meaning “Son of Ra”) and the first to connect his cartouche name with the sun god Ra.

== Family ==
Djedefre married his brother Kawab&#x27;s widow, Hetepheres II. Another queen, Khentetenka is known from statue fragments in the Abu Rowash mortuary temple. Known children of Djedefre are:
* Hornit (“Eldest King&#x27;s Son of His Body”) known from a statue depicting him and his wife.
* Baka (“Eldest King&#x27;s Son”) known from a statue base found in Djedefre&#x27;s mortuary temple, depicting him with his wife Hetepheres =

Djedefre married his brother Kawab&#x27;s widow, Hetepheres II, who was sister to both of them, and who perhaps married a third brother of theirs, Khafre, after Djedefre&#x27;s death. Another queen, Khentetenka.
* Setka (“Eldest King&#x27;s Son of His Body; Unique Servant of the King”) known from a scribe statue found in his father&#x27;s pyramid complex. It is possible that he ruled for a short while after his father&#x27;s death; an unfinished pyramid at Zawiyet el-Arian was started for a ruler whose name ends in &quot;ka;&quot; this could have been Setka or Baka.
* Neferhetepes (“King&#x27;s Daughter of His Body; God&#x27;s Wife”) is known from a statue fragment from Abu Rowash. Until recently, she was believed to be the mother of a pharaoh of the next dynasty, either Userkaf or Sahure.

The French excavation team led by found the names of two other possible children of Djedefre in the pyramid complex:
* Nikaudjedefre (“King&#x27;s Son of His Body”) was buried in Tomb F15 in Abu Rowash; it is possible that he wasn&#x27;t a son of Djedefre but lived later and his title was only honorary.
* Hetepheres (“King&#x27;s Daughter of His Body”) was mentioned on a statue fragment.

==Reign==


The Turin King List credits him with a rule of eight years, but the highest known year referred to during this reign appears to be the year of his 11th cattle count. The anonymous year of the 11th count date presumably of Djedefre was found written on the underside of one of the massive roofing-block beams which covered Khufu&#x27;s southern boat-pits by Egyptian work crews. Miroslav Verner notes that in the work crew&#x27;s mason marks and inscriptions, &quot;either Djedefra&#x27;s throne name or his Golden Horus name occur exclusively.&quot; Verner writes that the current academic opinion regarding the attribution of this date to Djedefre is disputed among Egyptologists: Rainer Stadelmann, , favour dating it to Djedefre whereas Wolfgang Helck, , Jean Vercoutter and W.S. Smith attribute this date to Khufu instead on the assumption &quot;that the ceiling block with the date had been brought to the building site of the boat pit already in Khufu&#x27;s time and placed in position [only] as late as during the burial of the funerary boat in Djedefre&#x27;s time.&quot;

The German scholar Dieter Arnold, in a 1981 MDAIK paper noted that the marks and inscriptions of the blocks from Khufu&#x27;s boat pit seem to form a coherent collection relating to the different stages of the same building project realised by Djedefre&#x27;s crews.
Verner stresses that such marks and inscriptions usually pertained to the breaking of the blocks in the quarry, their transportation, their storage and manipulation in the building site itself: &quot;In this context, the attribution of just a single inscription—and what is more, the only one with a date—on all the blocks from the boat pit to somebody other than Djedefra does not seem very plausible.&quot;

Verner also notes that the French-Swiss team excavating Djedefre&#x27;s pyramid have discovered that this king&#x27;s pyramid was really finished in his reign. According to Vallogia, Djedefre&#x27;s pyramid largely made use of a natural rock promontory which represented around 45% of its core; the side of the pyramid was 200 cubits long and its height was 125 cubits. The original volume of the monument of Djedefre, hence, approximately equalled that of Menkaura&#x27;s own pyramid. Therefore, the argument that Djedefre enjoyed a short reign because his pyramid was unfinished is somewhat discredited. This means that Djedefre likely ruled Egypt for a minimum of 11 years if the cattle count was annual, or 22 years if it was biennial; Verner, himself, supports the shorter, 11-year figure and notes that &quot;the relatively few monuments and records left by Djedefra do not seem to favour a very long reign&quot; for this king.

==Pyramid complex==
Djedefre continued the move north in the location of pyramids by building his (now ruined) pyramid at Abu Rawash, some to the north of Giza. It is the northernmost part of the Memphite necropolis.

While Egyptologists previously assumed that his pyramid at this heavily denuded site was unfinished upon his death, more recent excavations from 1995 to 2005 have established that it was indeed completed. The most recent evidence indicates that its current state is the result of extensive plundering in later periods while &quot;the king&#x27;s statues [were] smashed as late as the 2nd century AD.&quot; During the Roman period (c. 2000 years ago), Djedefre&#x27;s pyramid was quarried for its stone and, as such, there is little left standing today. The 20th century has also not been kind to this monument – during the last century, it was used as a military camp and its proximity to Cairo exposed it to modern development.

Some believe that the sphinx of his wife, Hetepheres II, which was part of Djedefre&#x27;s pyramid complex, was the first sphinx created. In 2004, evidence that Djedefre was responsible for the building of the Sphinx at Giza in the image of his father was reported by the French Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev.

Due to the poor condition of Abu Rawash, only small traces of his mortuary complex have been found. Only the rough ground plan of his mud brick mortuary temple was able to be traced—with some difficulty—&quot;in the usual place on the east face of the pyramid.&quot; His pyramid causeway proved to run from north to south rather than the more conventional east to west, while no valley temple has been found.

<text>Laurence Minot (1300? – 1352?) was an English poet. Nothing definite is known of him. It has been suggested that he was a cousin of Thomas Minot, Archbishop of Dublin 1363-75. If this is so, he came from a family from the north of England. He may have been a soldier. Eleven poems are attributed to him, all of which appear uniquely in Cotton MS Galba E IX in the British Library Department of Manuscripts, London. In them, he celebrates in northern English and with a somewhat ferocious patriotism the victories of Edward III over the Scots and the French.

<text>USS &quot;Milwaukee&quot; (CL-5) was an light cruiser built for the United States Navy during the 1920s. The ship spent most of her early career assigned to the Asiatic and Battle Fleets. In 1941, she was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol until she was refitted in New York in late 1941. She escorted a troop convoy to the Pacific in early 1942 before returning to the South Atlantic where she patrolled for German commerce raiders and blockade runners. In November, she intercepted one of the latter, but it scuttled itself before it could be captured. In 1944, she was temporarily transferred to the Soviet Navy and commissioned as &quot;Murmansk&quot;. The ship was returned by the Soviets in 1949 and sold for scrap in December.

==Description==

&quot;Milwaukee&quot; was long at the waterline and long overall, with a beam of and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men. The ship was fitted with a powerful echo sounder.

The ship was powered by four Westinghouse geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of . At deep load she carried of fuel oil that provided her a range of at a speed of .

&quot;Milwaukee&quot; mounted a dozen 53-caliber guns; four in two twin gun turrets and eight in tiered casemates fore and aft. Her secondary armament initially consisted of two 50-caliber  anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts, but this was doubled to four guns during construction. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make more space for crew accommodations. The ship carried above-water two triple and two twin torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. These lower mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the guns to four, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were only protected against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s, but the ship operated Curtiss SOC Seagulls from 1935 and Vought OS2U Kingfishers after 1940.

===Wartime changes===
After 1940 the lower aft six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was augmented by two quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts by early 1942, although these were replaced by twin Bofors 40 mm gun mounts later in the war. At about the same time, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; received eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
The contract for &quot;Milwaukee&quot;, the third ship named for the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was signed on 27 August 1917, and the ship was laid down by Todd Dry Dock and Construction Company, at their Tacoma, Washington shipyard on 13 December 1918. She was launched on 24 March 1921 and was commissioned on 20 June 1923. During the ship&#x27;s shakedown cruise, she visited Sydney, Australia, during the Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress which opened on 23 August. With her new depth–finding equipment, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; surveyed the floor of the Pacific en route. &quot;The Milwaukee Seamounts in the Northern Pacific are named after a set of soundings taken by &quot;Milwaukee&quot; in 1929.&quot;

During Fleet Problem VI, she collided with her sister ship in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 1 February 1926, although neither ship was seriously damaged. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; and the destroyer assisted victims of a fierce hurricane which had devastated the Isle of Pines in October. She was assigned to Cruiser Division 2 of the Asiatic Fleet in 1928. During an engagement with &quot;enemy&quot; cruisers during Fleet Problem IX on 16 April 1930, the ship was ruled to have been knocked out by the exercise&#x27;s umpires. Three years later, during Fleet Problem XIV, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; was spotted by fighters from the aircraft carrier and &quot;sunk&quot; by some of the opposing cruisers. In 1933, the ship was assigned to Cruiser Division 3 of the Battle Fleet. After the Panay Incident in December 1937, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; made a cruise through the Western Pacific from January to April 1938.

While steaming north of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on 14 February 1939, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; discovered the deepest place in the Atlantic Ocean. The spot—which has a depth of —is now known as the &quot;Milwaukee Deep&quot;. By January 1941, the ship had returned to Cruiser Division 2 which was now assigned to the Caribbean Patrol, commanded by Rear Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, part of the Neutrality Patrol established after the war began. Cruiser Division 2 was ordered to patrol the Atlantic between Trinidad, the Cape Verde Islands and the eastern bulge of Brazil in April, although &quot;Milwaukee&quot; was not immediately available. The ship, escorted by the destroyers and , began her first patrol in May, making a port visit to Recife, Brazil, on 1 June, before returning to San Juan, Puerto Rico. These patrols continued in the same manner for most of the rest of the year.

===World War II===

====South Atlantic====
&quot;Milwaukee&quot;, commanded by Captain Forrest B. Royal, was being in the Brooklyn Navy Yard when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December. The ship escorted a convoy to the Caribbean from New York on 31 December and then escorted eight troop transports from the Panama Canal to the Society Islands. She rejoined the South Atlantic Patrol Force upon her return and spend the next two years making patrols between Brazil and the African coast. On 19 May she received an SOS from the Brazilian cargo ship SS &quot;Commandante Lyra&quot;, which had been torpedoed by the off the coast of Brazil. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; found the freighter abandoned, burning, and listing to port. She rescued 25 survivors from their lifeboats, including the ship&#x27;s master. Reinforced by her sister and the destroyer , the fires were brought under control, cargo was jettisoned to lighten the ship, and &quot;Commandante Lyra&quot; was towed to Fortaleza, Brazil. Shortly after, on the night of 20 May, she was attacked by the &quot;Barbarigo&quot;, commanded by Enzo Grossi (who mistook her for a &quot;&quot;Maryland&quot;- or &quot;California&quot;- type battleship&quot;) with two torpedoes, which missed and were not even noticed by the American ships; however, Grossi claimed to have sunk his target, and was promoted to &quot;Capitano di Fregata&quot; (Commander) and decorated with the Gold Medal of Military Valour and the Iron Cross. Two subsequent commissions in 1949 and 1962 would eventually reverse the promotion and the decorations.

Rear Admiral Oliver M. Read assumed command of Cruiser Division 2 in October and hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Milwaukee&quot;. On 21 November, &quot;Milwaukee&quot;, her sister and the destroyer &quot;Somers&quot; intercepted the German blockade runner . When &quot;Somers&quot; had closed to , the German ship scuttled herself to prevent capture. &quot;Milwaukee&quot; rescued 62 of the ship&#x27;s crew. On 2 May 1943, while the ship was under repair at Recife, her crew helped to fight a fire on the oil tanker . &quot;Milwaukee&quot; and &quot;Omaha&quot; collided on 31 May off the coast of Brazil, although the extent of the damage is not known. The ship sailed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 8 February 1944, preparatory to her temporary transfer to the Soviet Union in lieu of Italian ships allotted after the Italian surrender that could not be delivered. She escorted a convoy to Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 8 March before forming part of the escort of Convoy JW 58 during her voyage to Murmansk beginning on 29 March.

===Soviet service===

On 20 April, the ship was transferred on loan to the Soviet Northern Fleet in Murmansk. She was commissioned in the Soviet Navy as &quot;Murmansk&quot; and performed convoy and patrol duty in the Arctic Ocean for the remainder of the war. Afterward, she became a training ship and participated in the 1948 fleet maneuvers. On 16 March 1949, &quot;Milwaukee&quot; was transferred back to the United States. She was the first of 15 American warships returned by the Soviet Union. She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 18 March 1949, and was sold for scrapping on 10 December to the American Shipbreakers, Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware.

<text>Scornicești () is a town in Olt County, Romania, with a population of 10,795. The town administers 13 villages (Bălțați, Bircii, Chițeasca, Constantinești, Jitaru, Mărgineni-Slobozia, Mihăilești-Popești, Mogoșești, Negreni, Piscani, Rusciori, Șuica, and Teiuș) and has a total area of , being the locality with the largest area in the county of Olt, surpassing even its capital, Slatina. Scornicești is situated in the historical region of Muntenia. It officially became a town in 1989, as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program.

==History==
Scornicești was the birthplace of communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu, who lived there until the age of 11, when he left for Bucharest to become a shoemaker. During his dictatorship, Ceaușescu wanted to make Scornicești a &quot;model town&quot; to house the newly created &quot;Socialist Man&quot;. Consequently, in 1988, he began his plan by demolishing the traditional village houses and replacing them with apartment buildings, and changed the town&#x27;s status from &quot;village&quot; to &quot;city&quot; (however, the bulldozers did not destroy Ceaușescu&#x27;s birth home, which is now one of the local attractions - see on WikiMapia).

Ceaușescu also built a large stadium (with a capacity of 18,000 spectators) for the local football team, FC Olt, which, with the help of the Ceaușescus, was promoted to Divizia A. Nowadays, the team plays in the Olt County Championship.

The Scornicești Solar Park power system of solar panels is located in the town.

==Natives==
* Radu Băldescu (1888–1953), major general during World War II
* Ion Barbu (born 1977), footballer
* Marin Ceaușescu (1916–1989), economist and diplomat, the older brother of Nicolae

<doc id="1098651" wikidata="Q6807178" url="?curid=1098651" title="Medium of instruction">
<text>A medium of instruction (plural: media of instruction, or mediums of instruction) is a language used in teaching. It may or may not be the official language of the country or territory. If the first language of students is different from the official language, it may be used as the medium of instruction for part or all of schooling. Bilingual education or multilingual education may involve the use of more than one language of instruction. UNESCO considers that &quot;providing education in a child&#x27;s mother tongue is indeed a critical issue&quot;. In post-secondary, university and special education settings, content may often be taught in a language that is not spoken in the students&#x27; homes. This is referred to as content based learning or content and language integrated learning (CLIL). In situations where the medium of instruction of academic disciplines is English when it is not the students&#x27; first language, the phenomenon is referred to as English-medium instruction (EMI).

==In different countries and regions==

===Africa===
* In Tanzania, Swahili is used in primary schools and adult education, whereas English is used in secondary schools and universities.
* In Zimbabwe, the use of English, Shona and Ndebele is established in education until the fourth grade; from the fourth grade, English is the medium of instruction.
* In South Africa, students are taught primarily in their home language from Grade Zero (Reception Year) up to Grade 3. From Grade 4 onwards, English is the default language of learning and teaching, except for a minority of schools in which Afrikaans is used. The national curriculum requires that all students study at least two official languages as separate subjects, one of which must be studied at home language level and the other at least at first additional language level. The most common home language among the school population is isiZulu.
* In Nigeria, the medium of instruction at all levels of education (primary, secondary, universities and colleges) is English.
* In the francophone states of Africa, education has typically been in French only.
* In Ethiopia, Amharic, Oromo, and other Ethiopian languages serve as the medium of instruction in primary education, while English is used in secondary schools and universities (French had been the medium of instruction in public schools pre-1936).

===Western Hemisphere===

====Brazil====

Every public school uses Brazilian Portuguese as the medium of instruction, but no law prohibits the use of other languages in private schools. Many schools use other European languages (mainly because of the country&#x27;s European heritage) such as English, German, Italian or French. Public schools also have mandatory English and Spanish but only once or twice a week.

====Canada====

*In Canada, almost all public schools use either English or French as the medium of instruction; French is standard in the province of Quebec (a few cities also offering English-language schools) and, along with English, in New Brunswick. The official language not used as the primary medium of instruction is taught as a mandatory subject in primary school and becomes optional for most secondary school students. Many public and private school systems in English jurisdictions also offer French immersion. In parts of Canada such as the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, some aboriginal languages, such as Inuinnaqtun and Tłı̨chǫ, are also used in local school systems. Heritage languages (immigrant or diaspora languages) are as also common across Canada in public and private schools.

====United States====
English is used, but in some schools, Spanish, French (in Louisiana), Hawaiian (in Hawaii), and local Native American/American Indian languages are used as well.
:*The Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults. There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade.

===Asia===

<text>USS &quot;Cincinnati&quot; (CL-6), was the third light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, built for the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, the first being , an ironclad commissioned in 1862, during the Civil War, and the second being , a protected cruiser, that was decommissioned in 1919.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; split her pre-war career between the Atlantic and the Pacific fleets. She served in the Scouting Fleet, based in the Atlantic, in 1924 to 1927, During which she obtained 2 Animals the crew would soon name Whiffles and Soup and would quickly become the vessels mascots, both would be seen sitting in her fore /53 caliber turret. She would serve in the Pacific for a brief time in 1925 for fleet maneuvers. &quot;Cincinnati&quot; joined the Asiatic Fleet in 1927, and returned to the Atlantic from 1928 to 1932. She continued to go back and forth between oceans until March 1941, when she was assigned to Neutrality Patrol in the western Atlantic.

When the United States entered World War II she was assigned to TF41, based at Recife, and used on convoy escort duties and patrols in the south Atlantic. In 1944, she sailed for the Mediterranean to support Operation Dragoon, the invasion of the south of France. After the war, she was deemed surplus and scrapped at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in February 1946.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Cincinnati&quot; was ordered on 29 August 1916, and contracted to be built by Todd Dry Dock and Construction Company, Tacoma, Washington, on 27 August 1917. Her keel was laid on 15 May 1920, and she was launched on 23 May 1921. She was sponsored by Mrs. Charles E. Tudor, wife of the Director of Safety of Cincinnati, having been designated by the Honorable John Galvin, Mayor of Cincinnati. &quot;Cincinnati&quot; was commissioned on 1 January 1924, Captain Charles P. Nelson in command.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and had a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peacetime, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; was powered by four Westinghouse geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 10 knots.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After the United States entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-inch/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. &quot;Cincinnati&quot; was also built with the capacity to carry 224 mines.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by three inches of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The conning tower and the deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had one and a half inches of armor. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and splinter damage.


&quot;Cincinnati&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were Vought VE-9s, then Vought UO-1s, the ship then operated Curtiss SOC Seagulls from 1935, and Vought OS2U Kingfishers after 1940.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Cincinnati&quot; went through several armament changes. Some of these changes were to reduce weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. On 8 September 1926, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Edward W. Eberle, along with the Commanders in Chief of the United States Fleet and Battle Fleet, and their subordinate commanding officers, the Secretary of the Navy, Curtis D. Wilbur, ordered that all mines and the tracks for laying the mines be removed from all of the &quot;Omaha&quot;-class cruisers, the working conditions had been found to be very &quot;wet&quot;. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s AA armament were originally augmented by three quadruple /75 gun mounts by early 1942, however, these didn&#x27;t prove to be reliable and were replaced by twin Bofors guns along with 14 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war. It was reported that &quot;Cincinnati&quot; also mounted a pair of Army 40mm Bofors guns.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; began her career with the Scouting Fleet in operations along the eastern seaboard and the Caribbean, until February 1927, when transferred to duty in the Far East, based at Shanghai. This duty only lasted until April 1928, when she sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, and conducted operations along the east coast again, until 1932. &quot;Cincinnati&quot; left for the Pacific joining the Battle Force, with occasional trips to the east coast, until 1939, when she was again reassigned to Atlantic duty. 

On 12 February 1935, she rescued six members of the crew of the downed airship USS &quot;Macon&quot;.

===World War II===

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; transferred to Pearl Harbor in April 1940, sailing for Guam and the Philippines and conducting transport duty at the end of the year. After a year in the Pacific &quot;Cincinnati&quot; returned to the Atlantic to join her sister ships in the expanding neutrality patrols in the western Atlantic. After the United States entered the war, she continued patrolling, along with convoy escort duties, blockading the French fleet at Martinique, and searching for German blockade runners.
On 21 November 1942, along with her sister and the destroyer , they spotted . The crew had begun to scuttle the ship, but the boarding party that had been dispatched was able to reach the ship and discover her true identity, a German blockade runner. They took the crew of 62 as prisoners, before she sank.
&quot;Cincinnati&quot; received an overhaul at New York, in early 1944, before serving as the escort flagship for three convoys crossing from New York to Belfast, Northern Ireland, from March 1944 to July 1944. She sailed for the western Mediterranean on 28 July, to assist with the assault on southern France, before again returning to New York for overhaul. She then joined the 4th Fleet at Recife, Brazil, on 17 November, and finished out the war in the European Theater patrolling the south Atlantic shipping lanes.

&quot;Cincinnati&quot; carried out two midshipmen training cruises during the summer of 1945. On 29 September, she arrived at Philadelphia, where a Board of Inspection and Survey recommended that she be taken out of commission. She was decommissioned 1 November 1945, and scrapped on 27 February 1946.
The ship&#x27;s bell is in the lobby of the main branch of the Cincinnati Public Library.

<text>USS &quot;Concord&quot; (CL-10) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the fourth Navy ship named for the town of Concord, Massachusetts, the site of the first battle of the American Revolution. She spent the first nine years of her career in the Atlantic as part of the Scouting Force. &quot;Concord&quot; transferred to the Pacific in 1932 and spent the rest of her career, except for the winter of 1938–1939, stationed there. Her home port moved to Pearl Harbor in April 1940, but she escaped the attack on Pearl Harbor because she was in San Diego for an overhaul.

==Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
&quot;Concord&quot; was authorized on 29 August 1916, and assigned to William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia on 30 July 1917. She was laid down on 29 March 1920, and launched on 15 December 1921, sponsored by Miss H. Butterick. &quot;Concord&quot; was commissioned on 3 November 1923, with future Admiral, Captain Orin G. Murfin in command.

&quot;Concord&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peacetime, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Concord&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 

&quot;Concord&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Concord&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Concord&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s, when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935, and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940, when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Concord&quot; went through several armament changes, some of these changes were to save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3–inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6–inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
On her maiden cruise, from 23 November 1923 – 9 April 1924, &quot;Concord&quot; called at Mediterranean ports, passed through the Suez Canal to round the Cape of Good Hope, and exercised with the fleet in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia. As flagship of Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Fleet, she cruised the Caribbean and sailed through the Panama Canal to exercise in the Hawaiian Islands in 1924–1925. Continuing to operate in the Atlantic, she joined in the Presidential Fleet Review taken by Calvin Coolidge on 4 June 1927.
Serving as flagship of Commander, Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3), Battle Force, &quot;Concord&quot; cruised the Pacific from her base at San Diego after early 1932, exercising in the Canal Zone and the Caribbean in 1934. On 12 February 1935, she rescued 11 members of the crew of the downed airship USS &quot;Macon&quot;. She took part in Presidential Fleet Reviews taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt on 30 September 1935 and 12 July 1938, and joined in fleet exercises in the Hawaiian area, in the Canal Zone, and off Alaska. After operating on the east coast in the winter of 1938–39, she returned to Pacific operations, and from 1 April 1940, was based at Pearl Harbor for a training schedule which intensified as war came closer.
===World War II===
When the US entered the war, &quot;Concord&quot; was at San Diego preparing for a shipyard overhaul which she completed early in February 1942. Assigned to the Southeast Pacific Force, she escorted convoys to Bora Bora in the Society Islands, exercised in the Canal Zone, and cruised along the coast of South America and to the islands of the southeast Pacific, serving from time to time as flagship of her force.

From 5 September – 24 November 1943, with Captain Irving Reynolds Chambers, commanding, she carried Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd on a tour to survey the potential use of a number of southeast Pacific islands in national defense and commercial aviation. During this cruise, she suffered a gasoline explosion which killed 24 men including her executive officer, and caused considerable damage, which was repaired at Balboa, Panama.

With repairs completed in March 1944, &quot;Concord&quot; set sail northward to join the Northern Pacific Force at Adak on 2 April. Serving as the flagship of Task Force 94 (TF 94) at the beginning of this duty, she joined in bombardments of the Kuriles which continued at intervals until the close of the war, preventing effective use by the Japanese of their bases there. Harassing the northern shipping lanes of Japan, her force sank several small craft, and on 25 August 1944, the destroyers of the force made an attack on a Japanese convoy.

On 31 August 1945, &quot;Concord&quot; stood out from Adak, covered the occupation landings at Ominato, Japan, from 8–14 September, and sailed on to Pearl Harbor, the Canal Zone, Boston, and Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 12 December, and sold for scrap on 21 January 1947. Before she was scrapped, the turret that fired the last shot of the War was removed. The turret has been preserved and put on display at the Chehalis veteran museum. Concord&#x27;s bell is displayed near Monument Square in her namesake town of Concord, MA.

<text>Elizabeth Montagu (née Robinson; 2 October 1718 – 25 August 1800) was a British social reformer, patron of the arts, salonnière, literary critic and writer, who helped to organize and lead the Blue Stockings Society. Her parents were both from wealthy families with strong ties to the British peerage and learned life. She was sister to Sarah Scott, author of &quot;A Description of Millenium [sic] Hall and the Country Adjacent&quot;. She married Edward Montagu, a man with extensive landholdings, to become one of the richer women of her era. She devoted this fortune to fostering English and Scottish literature and to the relief of the poor.

==Early life==
She was born in Yorkshire to Matthew Robinson (1694–1778) of West Layton and Edgeley in Yorkshire, and Elizabeth daughter of Robert Drake of Cambridge, by his wife Sarah Morris, daughter of Thomas Morris of Mount Morris, Monks Horton. Elizabeth was the eldest of their three daughters. Conyers Middleton, the prominent Cambridge don, was the second husband of her Drake grandmother Sarah Morris. Between 1720 and 1736 the family owned part of what is now a National Trust property: Treasurer&#x27;s House, in York. Elizabeth and her sister Sarah, the future novelist Sarah Scott, spent time as children on extended stays with Dr Middleton, as both parents were somewhat aloof. The two girls learned Latin, French, and Italian and studied literature. As a child, Elizabeth and Sarah, in particular, were very close, but grew apart after Sarah became sick with smallpox.

While young, Elizabeth became a friend of Lady Margaret Harley, later the Duchess of Portland, the only surviving child of Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. Lady Margaret and Elizabeth corresponded weekly when apart and were inseparable when together. She spent time with Lady Margaret in London and met many of the celebrated figures of the 1730s, including the poet Edward Young and the religious thinker Gilbert West. In Lady Margaret&#x27;s household, men and women spoke as equals and engaged in witty, learned banter. Mrs Montagu later used this model of intellectual discourse in her salons. Visits to Lady Margaret became more important to Elizabeth when her mother inherited a country seat in Kent and made that her home, with her daughters.

==Marriage to Montagu==

In 1738, Montagu wrote to Harley explaining that she had no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible to love a man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was 22 and he was 50 years old. The marriage was advantageous, but apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and she loved her child immensely. When the child died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to take religion increasingly seriously. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was also growing increasingly devout.

Elizabeth was accompanied most of the time by a lady&#x27;s companion, in a role derived from that of a royal lady in waiting. A companion would be expected to carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott took this function and adds that there is good reason to suggest that Scott married poorly to escape it (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth&#x27;s mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper or possibly mistress, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth&#x27;s father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help, but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.

Beginning in 1750, she and Edward established a routine, where they would winter in London in Mayfair and then in the spring go to Sandleford in Berkshire, which had been his since 1730. He would then go on to Northumberland and Yorkshire to manage his holdings, while she would occasionally accompany him to the family manor house at East Denton Hall, a mansion dating from 1622 on the West Road in Newcastle upon Tyne.

She was a shrewd businesswoman, despite affecting to patronise Northumbrian society for its practical conversation. Though acting as Lady Bountiful to miners and their families, she was pleased at how cheap this could be. She was also glad to note that &quot;our pitmen are afraid of being turned off and that fear keeps an order and regularity amongst them that is very uncommon.&quot; Elizabeth enjoyed hearing the miners singing in the pit, but found, alas, that their dialect (Geordie) was &quot;dreadful to the auditors&#x27; nerves.&quot; Horace Walpole wrote to George Montagu in 1768: &quot;Our best sun is Newcastle coal.&quot;

==Salon and cultural life==

In London during the 1750s, Elizabeth began to be a celebrated hostess. She organized literary breakfasts with Gilbert West, George Lyttelton and others. By 1760, these had turned into populous evening entertainments. Card playing and strong drink were forbidden from these convocations, which came to be now known as Blue Stocking events.

By 1770, Montagu&#x27;s home on Hill Street had become the premier salon in London. Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole were all in the circle. For writers, being introduced there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, James Woodhouse and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the Blue Stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, but she was the woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation through the Botham family. He entrusted her with the disposition of his papers on his departure for France, as he was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.&quot;
Montagu also held similar events at her residence in the centre house (No. 16) of the Royal Crescent, Bath. In Bath she also lived at Edgar Buildings; Orange Court; Gay Street and Queens Parade.

Some years after Montagu&#x27;s death, there appeared a poem by James Woodhouse, who had served the family as land bailiff and steward. This criticized her for being proud and vain. Woodhouse wrote that she patronized poets:
For they could best bestow delightful dow&#x27;rs,
by flattering speech, or fam&#x27;d poetic pow&#x27;rs.
==Bluestocking work and writing==
Elizabeth, as a Bluestocking, was called the &quot;Queen of the Blues&quot;. She led and hosted the Blue Stockings Society of England from about 1750. The loose organization of privileged women with an interest in education waned in popularity at the end of the 18th century. It gathered to discuss literature and also invited educated men to participate. Talk of politics was prohibited; literature and the arts were the main subjects. Many Bluestocking women supported each other in intellectual endeavours such as reading, art work, and writing. Many also published literature.

Elizabeth Montagu published two works in her lifetime. George Lyttelton in 1760 encouraged Elizabeth to write &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, and she contributed three sections to the work anonymously. (Her authorship is testified elsewhere.) It consists of a series of conversations between the living and the illustrious dead, and works as a satire of 18th-century vanity and manners. In 1769, she published &quot;An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespear&quot;. In it, she proclaims Shakespeare to be the greatest English poet, and in fact the greatest poet of any nation. She also attacks Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1765 &quot;Preface to Shakespeare&quot; for not having gone on to praise Shakespeare&#x27;s plays enough. While Johnson had dealt with text, history, and the circumstances of editing, Montagu wrote instead about the characters, plots, and beauties of the verse in Shakespeare and saw in him a championing of all things inherently English. When the book was initially published anonymously, it was thought to be by Joseph Warton, but by 1777 her name appeared on the title page. Johnson, for his part, was estranged from Montagu at this point.
In the late 1760s, Edward Montagu fell ill, and Elizabeth took care of him, although she resented giving up her freedom. In 1766 her friend John Gregory came to stay and he brought two of his daughters. Montagu was captivated by the two girls and the four of them went on a Scottish tour. When they returned John Gregory had to return home but Montagu persuaded him to leave the &quot;dear dear little girls&quot; with her. In return she undertook to advise him on their education.

In 1770 the Gregorys returned and it was agreed that Montagu would take Dorothea Gregory as her companion. The arrangement worked well as Dorothea took on jobs for her like driving the carriage and being a confidante. Dorothea&#x27;s future seemed secure but she wanted a partner and Montagu was insistent that the only candidate was her nephew.

Her husband died in 1775. In 1776, she adopted her nephew, the orphan of her brother. Matthew Robinson, the child, kept his family name, but he was named Elizabeth&#x27;s heir. At that point, the coal and landholdings Montagu passed on to Elizabeth accounted for an income of £7,000 a year. (She managed her wealth and estates well, and by her death her coal income was worth 10,000 pounds a year.) In 1782 Montagu was arranging for her nephew and Dorothea to meet. Dorothea was not attracted to him at all and in the autumn she went on holiday and agreed to marry Archibald Alison (1757–1839). Montagu was still annoyed in 1784 when Dorothea married. 
In 1777, Montagu began work on Montagu House in Portman Square in London, where she moved in 1781, on land leased for 99 years. She also expanded Sandleford Priory in the 1780s, and had Capability Brown design its garden and alter the park. She died at Montagu House in London on 25 August 1800 and left Sandleford and all of her money to her nephew.

==Works==

Elizabeth Montagu was the author of two works published in her lifetime: three sections in George Lyttelton&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; (1760) and &quot;An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare&quot; (1769). In addition, two collections of Montagu&#x27;s letters were published posthumously.

&quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; was a series of critiques of 18th-century society. In Dialogue 26, Hercules is engaged in a discussion of virtue. In Dialogue 27, a character, Mrs. Mopish, cannot go the Elysian Fields because she is endlessly distracted by worldly influences. In Dialogue 28, a bookseller explains to Plutarch the difficulties of publishing in modern society.

&quot;An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare&quot; defends Shakespeare against criticism by supporters of the French style of drama, particularly against the attacks of Voltaire. In &quot;Essay&quot; Montagu claims Shakespeare&#x27;s success comes from his overall virtue and ability to engage the audiences&#x27; emotion, not from strict adherence to the classical models of drama.

==Letters==
Montagu was a copious writer of letters to her coterie and beyond. They include discussions of health, domestic arraignments, travel plans and reports of social events. About a third of her correspondence focuses on culture such as theatre, opera, public spectacles, moral philosophy and divinity. Of these topics, history was discussed more than twice as much as any other topic.

Her most frequent correspondence on literature was with her sister, Sarah Scott, followed by her friends, Elizabeth Carter and Gilbert West. She and Scott were both avid readers of published letters throughout their lives, reading collections by Pope and Swift. This influenced the women&#x27;s own letter writing. Their frequency of correspondence waxed and waned over the years depending on the circumstances of their lives; Montagu is believed to have written to Scott more frequently than she replied.

Similarly, Montagu is said to have sent more letters to Elizabeth Carter than she received from her. Montagu was an ardent supporter of Carter, despite her friend being of a lower class. She respected her skill and virtue. Montagu felt comfortable enough to correspond with Carter about the responsibility of great wealth.

Gilbert West influenced Montagu&#x27;s thinking about religion, history and literature. He also affected her style of writing for a time. Based on his example, she began writing in more formal syntax, but eventually became irritated by the restrictions and reverted to her freer, more natural style.

Montagu corresponded with George Lyttelton frequently about literature and history, a relationship which would later lead to Lyttelton to include three of her works in his &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. Their letters were known to have markedly different tones: hers were serious and intellectual, his responses tended towards the flirtatious.

Montagu maintained a close relationship with the elder statesman, William Pulteney, Lord Bath. This was purely emotional, but described as a &quot;pseudo-courtship&quot;.

Lady Margaret Harley, Duchess of Portland was a lifelong friend of Montagu&#x27;s, to whom Montagu vented her frustrations over the institution of marriage and her desire for a truly companionate marriage – if she must have one at all. Montagu also said that marriage should include a financial incentive.

A collection of Montagu&#x27;s letters was first published 1809 by her nephew and heir, Matthew Montagu, under the title, &quot;The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, with Some of the Letters of her Correspondents.&quot; The selection reflects a concern for Montagu&#x27;s moral reputation. Another edition of her letters was released in 1906 by Matthew&#x27;s granddaughter, Emily J. Climenson, and her friend, Reginald Blunt. This revised collection expanded on Montagu&#x27;s view of the social world, including fashion, politics, and nobility.

== Politics ==
Elizabeth Montagu was interested in the political debates of her day and she contributed to the political process in the various ways open to her as an elite woman and female intellectual. Within the context of these male relationships, particularly via her husband and friends George Lyttleton and William Pulteney( the Earl of Bath) Montagu had an opportunity to discuss political philosophy as well as practical politics; developing her own political positions. She represented her interest in the political realm as an extension of family duty and expression of female tenderness. She was therefore able to forward her own opinions within the prevailing gender conventions of the time without appearing transgressive. 

== Legacy ==
Swansea University aims to produce a fully annotated, digital, critical, and open-access edition of the extant correspondence of Elizabeth Montagu. Elizabeth Montagu Correspondence Online (EMCO) offers access to transcriptions and facsimiles of original manuscripts, accurate and exhaustive notes, and the most recently discovered letters.

The Royal Crescent Hotel in Bath is located at a former residence of Elizabeth Montagu 16 Royal Crescent. In May a new restaurant Montagu Mews was opened and named in her honour.

<text>Alexander Montgomerie (Scottish Gaelic: Alasdair Mac Gumaraid) (c. 1550?–1598) was a Scottish Jacobean courtier and poet, or makar, born in Ayrshire. He was a Scottish Gaelic speaker and a Scots speaker from Ayrshire, an area which was still part of the Scottish Gàidhealtachd in his day. He was one of the principal members of the Castalian Band, a circle of poets in the court of James VI in the 1580s which included the king himself. Montgomerie was for a time in favour as one of the king&#x27;s &quot;favourites&quot;. He was a Catholic in a largely Protestant court and his involvement in political controversy led to his expulsion as an outlaw in the mid-1590s.

Montgomerie&#x27;s poetry, much of which examines themes of love, includes autobiographical sonnets and foreshadows the later metaphysical poets in England. He is sometimes, by tradition, given the epithet &quot;Captain&quot;.

==Early life==

Montgomerie was a younger son of the Ayrshire laird Hugh Montgomerie of Hessilhead (d. 1558) and so was related to the Earl of Eglinton, and a distant relation of James VI.

Nothing is known for certain about his life before about 1580, but contemporary or near-contemporary accounts suggest that he was brought up as a member of the Church of Scotland, spent some time in Argyll before leaving for the Continent, and was converted to Catholicism in Spain. He probably saw active service as a soldier for the Scottish forces in The Netherlands in the later 1570s, although there is no certain documentary evidence of this.

Montgomerie&#x27;s arrival in Edinburgh may have been linked in some way to that of the king&#x27;s Catholic, French-born kinsman Esmé Stewart, whose ascendancy at court coincides with the period of the poet&#x27;s greatest prominence (1580–86).

==Works==

It is likely that his earliest surviving poems are &quot;The Navigation&quot; and the related &quot;Cartel of the Thre Ventrous Knichts&quot;, which may well have been written for performance at court at Epiphany 1580. The &quot;Navigatioun&quot; involves the torchlit entrance at Holyrood Palace of a narrator and his companions, a &quot;Turk, the More, and the Egyptien&quot;. The court musicians were bought &quot;mask claithis&quot; comprising red and yellow taffeta with swords and daggers. Montgomerie&#x27;s prologue alludes to the Magi and Epiphany to flatter James VI as the Northern Star. James was also characterised as Solomon. The masque was followed by dancing.

Montgomerie came to prominence as &quot;laureled&quot; leader of the Castalian Band, a circle of court poets headed by the King after being declared victor over a rival poet, Patrick Hume of Polwarth, in a comically scurrilous flyting, or poetic duel. The King, who was himself a practising member of the group, referred to Montgomerie as its &#x27;maister poete&#x27;.

A number of Montgomerie&#x27;s poems can be assigned to the first half of the 1580s, including sonnets, court songs, and the first, unfinished version of his longest work, the allegorical &quot;Cherrie and the Slae&quot;. Like some other pieces, it may have been written (at least in part) by autumn 1584, for the 19-year-old king included a passage from it in his literary manifesto &quot;Some Reulis and Cautelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis poesie&quot;, published around September of that year.

==Courtier==

As early as 27 July 1583 Montgomerie was granted a pension by the king, drawn from the revenues of Glasgow Cathedral. His career had evidently survived the temporary imprisonment of James by a militant Protestant faction led by the Earl of Gowrie, and the exile and death of Esmé Stewart, whom James had made Duke of Lennox. But there seems to have been a fundamental change in the culture of the court towards the end of 1585, when the king took personal control of the government, and in the summer of 1586 Montgomerie joined an enlarged Scottish contingent fighting for the Dutch Republic against the Spanish.

He stayed there for more than two years, serving at Zutphen at the same time as the unfortunate Sir Philip Sidney, and eventually experiencing severe financial difficulties as a result of non-payment by the Dutch authorities. He eventually struck a deal with the States of Holland in February 1588, and was back in Scotland by the end of the year.

Life at court was now very different from what it had been before Montgomerie&#x27;s departure, not least because of (justified) allegations of intrigue between leading Catholic aristocrats and the Spanish. On a more personal level, the poet&#x27;s pension had been claimed by someone else during his absence, and a long legal struggle ended in defeat for Montgomerie in July 1593. This battle produced some of his most remarkable poetry, increasingly embittered sonnets encouraging, cajoling, and eventually attacking the judges and lawyers involved, and even the king himself. At the same time, he continued to write formal poems about life at court, while some undated songs and other verses may well also come from this period.

==Expulsion and death==

Mongomerie largely disappears from view after the collapse of his legal case, until he became involved, in late 1596 or early 1597, in a Catholic plot to seize the rocky outcrop of Ailsa Craig, in the lower Firth of Clyde, as support for a Spanish intervention in the Earl of Tyrone&#x27;s rebellion in Ireland. Led by Montgomerie&#x27;s friend and fellow-poet Hugh Barclay of Ladyland, this enterprise soon collapsed, Barclay being killed in the process, and on 14 July 1597 Montgomerie was declared an outlaw.

He may have planned to leave the country, perhaps to go to the Scottish Benedictine monastery in Würzburg, but he was still in Scotland at the time of his death in August 1598. His death proved as controversial as much of his life, for the authorities of the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh refused to allow him to be buried in the churchyard on the grounds of his Catholicism, only an intervention by the king himself forcing them to change their minds. Montgomerie&#x27;s exact place of burial is unknown, but it must have been in the church or grounds of Holyrood Abbey, which was then used by the Canongate congregation.

==Literary assessment==

Montgomerie&#x27;s poetic output of over 100 pieces is mostly known from just one witness, the Ker manuscript, presented to Edinburgh University Library by the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden. It is possible that this was assembled from Montgomerie&#x27;s papers soon after his death; it must, in any case, have been written soon afterwards.

The range of his work is extensive, from elegant court songs including &quot;Lyk as the dum Solsequium&quot; and &quot;Melancholie, grit deput of Dispair&quot; to the bitter, sometimes contorted word-play of the sonnets associated with the dispute over his pension, from witty pieces addressed to the king to the profound religious sensibility of &quot;A godly prayer&quot; and the extraordinary &quot;Come, my childrene dere&quot;. Montgomerie is one of the finest of Middle Scots poets, and perhaps the greatest Scottish exponent of the sonnet form (although the twentieth-century poets Robert Garioch and Edwin Morgan were also fine sonnetteers).

&quot;The Cherrie and the Slae&quot;, which he probably revised and completed shortly before his death, is an ambitious religious allegory, employing a demanding, lyrical stanza form which suggests that it was intended for singing, despite its considerable length. His poetry reaches back to the earlier makars, Henryson, Dunbar and Douglas, but he also translates from Clément Marot and from Ronsard, and some of his work invites comparison with Baroque writers such as Marino, Góngora, Donne and Herbert.

<doc id="1098679" wikidata="Q1306352" url="?curid=1098679" title="Stanley Baker">
<text>Sir William Stanley Baker (28 February 192828 June 1976) was a Welsh actor and film producer. Known for his rugged appearance and intense, grounded screen persona, he was one of the top British male film stars of the late 1950s, and later a producer.

Born into a coal mining family in Glamorgan, Baker began his acting career in the West End. Following national service in the Royal Army Service Corps after the Second World War, he befriended actor Richard Burton and began appearing in film and television roles. He played the lead role in &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; and supporting role in &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;. He was producer and lead actor in the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, in which he portrayed John Chard. 

Baker&#x27;s performance in the 1959 film &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enemy&quot; was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actor, and he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his turn in the BBC serial &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;. He was awarded a knighthood in 1976, although he died before the investiture ceremony: a heavy smoker, he developed lung cancer and he died in 1976.

==Early life==
Baker was born in Ferndale, Glamorgan, Wales, the youngest of three children. His father was a coal miner who lost a leg in a pit accident but continued working as a lift operator at the mine until his death. Baker grew up a self-proclaimed &quot;wild kid&quot; interested in only &quot;football and boxing&quot;. He thought he would most likely be a miner or maybe a boxer.

His artistic ability was spotted at an early age by a local teacher, Glynne Morse, who encouraged Baker to act. When he was 14 he was performing in a school play when seen by a casting director from Ealing Studios, who recommended him for a role in &quot;Undercover&quot; (1943), a war film about the Yugoslav guerrillas in Serbia. He was paid £20 a week, caught the acting bug, and pursued a professional acting career. Six months later Baker appeared with Emlyn Williams in a play in the West End called &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Rest&quot;, appearing alongside Richard Burton.

Baker worked for a time as an apprentice electrician, then through Morse&#x27;s influence, he managed to secure a position with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1944. He was there for three years when he had to do his national service. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps from 1946 until 1948, attaining the rank of sergeant. Following his demobilisation Baker returned to London determined to resume his acting career. He was recommended by Richard Burton for casting in a small role in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s West End play, &quot;Adventure Story&quot; (1949).

==Career==
===Early career===
Baker began appearing in films and on television, as well as performing on stage for the Middlesex Repertory Company. He had small roles in &quot;All Over the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Obsession&quot; (1949), &quot;Your Witness&quot; (1950), &quot;Lilli Marlene&quot; (1950), &quot;Something in the City&quot; (1950), &quot;The Rossiter Case&quot; (1951), &quot;Cloudburst&quot; (1951), &quot;Home to Danger&quot; (1951) and &quot;Whispering Smith Hits London&quot; (1952).

His TV roles included &quot;The Tragedy of Pompey the Great&quot; (1950) and &quot;Rush Job&quot; (1951). Baker attracted attention when cast as the bosun&#x27;s mate in the Hollywood-financed &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; (1951). It was the ninth most popular film at the British box office that year.

In 1951 he toured England in a play by Christopher Fry, &quot;A Sleep of Prisoners&quot; which was part of the Festival of Britain. It was about four POWs spending a night in a bombed out church and was staged in actual churches; the rest of the cast includes Denholm Elliott, Hugh Pryse and Leonard White. The project was transferred in its entirety to New York for a limited run, and also toured throughout the US.

While in New York, Baker read the novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; by Nicholas Monsarrat. Although the role of the cowardly officer Bennett was an Australian in the book, the Englishman Donald Sinden was originally screen-tested for the part and the Welsh Baker was screen-tested for the part of Lockhart. Subsequently, at Jack Hawkins&#x27; suggestion and after further screen-tests, the roles were swapped. &quot;The Cruel Sea (1953 film)&quot; was the most successful film at the British box office in 1953 and Baker was now established in films.

On television was in &quot;A Cradle in Willow&quot; and played Petruchio in a version of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1952). He had a small role in a British-US co-production for Warwick Films, &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953), with Alan Ladd, another big hit in Britain. Warwick liked his work so much they promptly reteamed him with Ladd in &quot;Hell Below Zero&quot; (1954), with Baker billed fourth as the main villain.

Baker got another break when George Sanders fell ill and was unable to play Sir Mordred in the expensive epic &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953), made by MGM in Britain. Baker stepped in and got excellent reviews; the movie was very popular.

He had his biggest role in a purely British film with &quot;The Good Die Young&quot; (1954), directed by Lewis Gilbert, playing a boxer who commits a robbery. Baker was cast in &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; (1954) opposite Ginger Rogers, replacing Walter Rilla, who quit the production ten days into filming.
Hollywood came calling again and offered him the choice support role of Achilles in &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1955), shot in Italy for Robert Wise.

Most of Baker&#x27;s film roles until this stage had been playing villains. His career received another boost when Laurence Olivier selected him to play Henry Tudor in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1955).

On TV he was in &quot;The Creature&quot; (1955) by Nigel Kneale, later filmed (without Baker) as &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; (1957). He was in another epic, playing Attalus in &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956), which starred Burton in the title role and was shot in Spain for Robert Rossen. He also portrayed Rochester in a British TV adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1956).

Baker&#x27;s first leading role in a feature film came with &quot;Child in the House&quot; (1956), written and directed by Cy Endfield. He had a support role as a psychotic corporal in &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot; (1956), a Korean War film that also featured early performances from Michael Caine, Stephen Boyd and Robert Shaw. He was the villain in a racing car drama, &quot;Checkpoint&quot; (1956), opposite Anthony Steel. It was made by the team of Betty E. Box and Ralph Thomas for the Rank Organisation.

===Lead actor===
Baker finally broke away from supporting parts when cast as the lead in &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957), a truck driving drama directed by Endfield. Before it was released he played another villain role for Box and Thomas, &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Kingdom&quot; (1957), opposite Dirk Bogarde, shot in Italy (substituting for Canada). Following this he was meant to make &quot;Tread Softly Stranger&quot; with Diana Dors but George Baker was cast instead. &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; was a minor hit, and at the end of the year exhibitors voted Baker the seventh most popular British star at the British box office for 1957 (after Bogarde, Kenneth More, Peter Finch, John Gregson, Norman Wisdom and John Mills, and before Ian Carmichael, Jack Hawkins and Belinda Lee). The success of &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; saw Baker play a series of tough anti-heroes. In the words of David Thomson:
Until the early 1960s, Baker was the only male lead in the British cinema who managed to suggest contempt, aggression and the working class. He is the first hint of proletarian male vigour against the grain of Leslie Howard, James Mason, Stewart Granger, John Mills, Dirk Bogarde and the theatrical knights. Which is not to disparage these players, but to say that Baker was a welcome novelty, that he is one of Britain&#x27;s most important screen actors, and that he has not yet been equalled – not even by Michael Caine.
Baker was a detective in &quot;Violent Playground&quot; (1958), a drama about juvenile delinquency from the director-producer team Basil Dearden and Michael Relph. He was reunited with Endfield for &quot;Sea Fury&quot; (1958), an action drama, playing a tugboat captain. He was voted the tenth biggest British star in Britain at the end of the year.

He made the Hollywood-financed &quot;The Angry Hills&quot; (1959) in Greece with Robert Aldrich opposite Robert Mitchum. Baker said Aldrich offered to engage him in a 28-part series about an Englishman in New York, but he had turned it down to stay in Britain.

Baker had the lead in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enemy&quot; (1959), a World War II drama set in Burma for Hammer Films, directed by Val Guest.
He was a detective in &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1959) for director Joseph Losey, one of Baker&#x27;s favourite roles. He made a fourth film with Endfield, &quot;Jet Storm&quot; (1959) playing an airline captain. None of these films were particularly huge at the box office but at the end of the year Baker was voted the fourth most popular British star. &quot;Hell Is a City&quot; (1960) had him as another hardbitten detective, a second collaboration with Val Guest. He was reunited with Losey for &quot;The Criminal&quot; (1960), playing an ex-con, and Baker&#x27;s favourite role.

He played the relatively small role of &quot;Butcher Brown&quot;, a war-weary commando, in the Hollywood blockbuster war epic &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) shot in Greece. It was a massive hit at the box office.

A third collaboration with Losey was &quot;Eva&quot; (1962), a French-Italian film where Baker acted opposite Jeanne Moreau. Aldrich asked him to play another villain role, in the Biblical epic &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (1962). There was some talk he would play Rufio in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) but it did not eventuate. He was a tough army officer committing a robbery in &quot;A Prize of Arms&quot; (1962) but the film failed at the box office and it seemed the market for the tough action films in which Baker had specialised might be drying up. He appeared opposite Jean Seberg in &quot;In the French Style&quot; (1962), a French-American romance produced by Irwin Shaw. He was in &quot;The Man Who Finally Died&quot; (1963) for British TV.

Baker&#x27;s widow later claimed that he was originally offered the role of James Bond, but turned it down not wanting to commit to a long-term contract. She also says he was going to star in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; but had to drop out when &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; went over schedule. She says Baker never regretted losing the part of Bond to Sean Connery but regretted not making &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;.

===Production===

Baker formed his own company, &#x27;Diamond Films&#x27; with Cy Endfield. They developed a script about the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift written by Endfield and John Prebble. While making &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; Baker struck up a relationship with that film&#x27;s producer, Joseph E. Levine which enabled him to raise the $3 million budget for &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964), directed by Endfield, shot partly on location in South Africa. &quot;Zulu&quot; was a big hit at the box office and made a star of Michael Caine. Baker played the lead part of Lieutenant John Chard VC in what remains his best-remembered role. He later owned Chard&#x27;s Victoria Cross and Zulu War Medal from 1972 until his death in 1976. (Chard died at age 49 in 1897, only a year older than Baker at his death; both died of cancer).

Baker made two more films in South Africa: &quot;Dingaka&quot; (1965), on which he worked as an actor only but which was distributed by Levine, and &quot;Sands of the Kalahari&quot; (1965), which he starred in and produced, directed by Endfield and financed by Levine. Both were box-office failures commercially and Baker made no further films with Endfield. Baker had plans to film Wilbur Smith&#x27;s debut novel &quot;When the Lion Feeds&quot; and &quot;The Coral Strand&quot; by John Masters. but neither project was realised.

He made a TV movie for the United Nations entitled &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind?&quot; (1965), and appeared in two episodes of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;: &quot;After the Lion, Jackals&quot; (1966) and &quot;Code Name: Heraclitus&quot; (1967). In 1966 he made a deal with Universal to produce and star in a film. He made a final film with Losey, &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), cast against type as an academic.

Baker formed the production company Oakhurst Productions with Michael Deeley. Its first cinema film was &quot;Robbery&quot; (1967), a heist film with Baker in the lead role. It was a solid success in Britain and launched the Hollywood career of director Peter Yates. Baker announced he would make another film for Levine, &quot;A Nice Girl Like Me&quot; acting opposite Hayley Mills who would play a girl who constantly gets pregnant. The film would be made by Levine, but not with Baker or Mills. He was also going to film the John Roeburt novel &quot;The Climate of Hell&quot; with James Goldstone. and the Norman Lewis novel &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Brother&quot;. He appeared in &quot;The Girl with the Pistol&quot; (1968), an Italian comedy, then worked as a producer only on two films for Oakhurst: &quot;Sleep Is Lovely&quot; (1968), which was never released, and &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969) a heist comedy with Michael Caine, a big hit. He was also part of the consortium which set up Harlech Television. At the end of 1968 exhibitors voted him the ninth biggest star in Britain, after John Wayne, Julie Christie, Steve McQueen, Tommy Steele, Paul Newman, Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood and Julie Andrews.

Baker produced and starred in &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot; (1969) for Oakhurst opposite Tommy Steele for director James Clavell. It was a box office failure.
As an actor only, he appeared in &quot;The Games&quot; (1970) for 20th Century Fox. He appeared in two films for producer Dimitri de Grunwald: &quot;The Last Grenade&quot; (1970), playing a mercenary, and &quot;Perfect Friday&quot; (1970), a heist movie directed by Peter Hall which Baker helped produce.

===Later career===
In the 1970s, Baker announced a number of projects as producer, including an adaptation of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman&quot;, to be directed by Richard Lester, and &quot;Summer Fires&quot; with Peter Hall. &quot;I don&#x27;t make films to see myself perform, I do it to act&quot;, said Baker. &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed everything I&#x27;ve worked on, including the bad pictures... I enjoy being a working actor. I&#x27;ve been accused by journalists of lack of discretion, lack of taste. Well I&#x27;d rather have that lack than the lack of having made them... Producing is total involvement and compatible with acting, while I don&#x27;t think directing is. Producing gives you a continuity of effort that helps with acting.&quot;

He also expanded his business interests. He was one of the founder members of Harlech Television, and was a director of it until his death.

With Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings, he formed &#x27;Great Western Enterprises&#x27;, which was involved in a number of projects in the entertainment field, notably music concerts, and in the late 1960s it bought Alembic House (now called Peninsula Heights) on the Albert Embankment, where Baker occupied the penthouse apartment for a number of years. Baker, Deeley, and Spikings were also part of a consortium that bought British Lion Films and Shepperton Studios, selling Alembic House to finance it. Baker said in 1972 that:
I love business for the activity it creates, the total commitment. The acting bit is great for the ego, (but) all the real excitement is in business... I&#x27;m still surprised how good I am at business.

However, Baker was the victim of bad timing. The British film industry went into serious decline at the end of the 1960s, and a number of Oakhurst films were unsuccessful at the box office. Plans to make a costume drama called &quot;Sunblack&quot;, directed by Gordon Flemyng, did not come to fruition. His commercial foray into pop music festivals was financially disastrous, with the Great Western Bardney Pop Festival in Lincoln ending up losing £200,000. The British stock market crashed at the end of 1973, throwing the over-leveraged British Lion into turmoil.

Baker was forced to keep acting to pay the bills, often accepting roles in poor films which adversely affected his status as a star. His son Glyn later said that:&quot;My dad had to accept any and everything to keep the companies afloat. Doing staggeringly-bad stuff like &quot;Popsy Pop&quot;, which was an Italian–Venezuelan co-production and &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; [both 1971] – a movie which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. At the slowest period, Stanley still had a payroll of at least 100 in his employ. So it was, &#x27;Here we go – take the money, make this trash, hopefully, no one will ever see it.&#x27; Famous last words.&quot;&#x27;
According to Michael Deeley, the financiers of British Lion Films were reluctant for Baker to be involved in the management of the company because they felt his focus was more on his acting career.

&quot;The Butterfly Affair&quot; (1970) was with Claudia Cardinale; &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot; (1971) was an Italian &quot;giallo&quot; movie; &quot;Innocent Bystanders&quot; (1972) was directed by Peter Collinson who had done &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.

Towards the end of his life Baker pulled back on his business activities and worked mostly as an actor, taking roles in television including two of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series: &quot;The Changeling&quot; and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (both 1974), plus &quot;Who Killed Lamb?&quot; (1974) and &quot;Graceless Go I&quot; (1974).

He made a series of films in Spain: &quot;Zorro&quot; (1975), starring Alain Delon, where Baker played the main villain; &quot;Bride to Be&quot; (1975), with Sarah Miles.

Baker&#x27;s final British performance was in a BBC Wales adaptation of &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; (1975), broadcast shortly before he was diagnosed with cancer. Shortly before his death he was planning on producing a prequel to &quot;Zulu&quot;, &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;. His last role was in an Italian TV miniseries, &quot;&quot; (1976), based on the novel &quot;Orzowei&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Baker married the actress Ellen Martin, who had been introduced to him by Burton. Their marriage lasted until his death and they had four children, Martin and Sally (twins), Glyn and Adam. Glyn appeared in &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978), opposite Richard Burton, and in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), as Lieutenant Endicott, the imperial officer who said, &quot;Inform the commander that Lord Vader&#x27;s shuttle has arrived.&quot; He was a friend and drinking companion of Richard Burton. 

Baker was a socialist and an acquaintance of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and recorded television broadcasts in support of the Labour Party. Many of his friends believed Baker had damaged his acting career through his attempts to transform himself into a businessman.

Baker moved to Spain to live in the early 1970s.

In an interview shortly before his death he admitted to being a compulsive gambler all his life, although he claimed he always had enough money to look after his family.

On 27 May 1976, a month before his death, it was announced that he had been awarded a knighthood in the 1976 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, although he did not live to be invested in person at Buckingham Palace.

==Death and legacy==
Baker was a heavy cigarette and cigar smoker, and was diagnosed with lung cancer on 13 February 1976. He underwent surgery later that month. However, the cancer had spread to his bones and he died from pneumonia on 28 June 1976 in Málaga, Spain, aged 48.

His body was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium, his ashes being scattered on a hillside overlooking his childhood home. He told his wife shortly before he died:
I have no regrets. I&#x27;ve had a fantastic life; no one has had a more fantastic life than I have. From the beginning I have been surrounded by love. I&#x27;m the son of a Welsh miner and I was born into love, married into love and spent my life in love.

Ferndale RFC, a rugby club in the Rhondda Valleys, South Wales, established a tribute to Baker in the form of their &quot;Sir Stanley Baker Lounge&quot;. Officially opened by his widow, Ellen, Lady Baker, on Friday 24 November 2006, the day&#x27;s events featured a presentation to Stanley Baker&#x27;s sons and family members, and a fitting and moving tribute to the man himself via speeches and tales from celebrities and various local people who knew him best. The afternoon also featured a BBC Radio Wales tribute to Stanley Baker, hosted by Owen Money and recorded live in Ferndale RFC itself. The Sir Stanley Baker Lounge features many pictures and memorabilia from his successful career, including a wall plaque commemorating the official opening in both English and Welsh.

<text>USS &quot;Detroit&quot; (CL-8) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the fourth Navy ship named for the city of Detroit, Michigan. She spent her first eight years as part of the Scouting Fleet either in the Atlantic or Mediterranean. Her first duty was to assist in the USAAS&#x27;s first aerial circumnavigation of the world in 1924 and transported the United States Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg, in 1927, from Ireland to France for the negotiations that led to the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In 1931 she joined the Battle Force, where her home port was San Diego until moving to Pearl Harbor in 1941. &quot;Detroit&quot; was moored next to her sister when the Japanese attacked on the morning of 7 December 1941.

==Built in Quincy, Massachusetts==
&quot;Detroit&quot; ordered 4 March 1917 with the contract being awarded to Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 21 August 1917. She was laid down on 10 November 1920 and launched 29 June 1922. Her sponsor was Miss M. Couzens, daughter of James J. Couzens, the Mayor of Detroit, Michigan. &quot;Detroit&quot; was commissioned on 31 July 1923, with Captain J. Halligan, Jr. in command.

&quot;Detroit&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Detroit&quot; was powered by four Curtis steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 

&quot;Detroit&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Detroit&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Detroit&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Detroit&quot; went through several armament changes, some of these changes were to save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts, and in 1944, the upper fore 6-in guns were removed. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by five twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Inter-war period==
After a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean, &quot;Detroit&quot; joined the Scouting Fleet for exercises and maneuvers along the east coast and in the Mediterranean. From September–October 1924, she was on lifeguard station for the USAAS&#x27;s round-the-world flight, then served as flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Divisions until 23 November. After overhaul at Boston, she sailed on 2 February 1925 for the west coast and fleet maneuvers along the coast and in Hawaiian waters. She returned to Boston on 10 July with the Scouting Fleet.

As flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Division 3, from July 1925 to March 1926 and July to December 1926, &quot;Detroit&quot; continued to participate in maneuvers and fleet problems along the east coast and in the Caribbean. From March–April 1927, she patrolled off the coast of Nicaragua to protect American interests during political disturbances there.

&quot;Detroit&quot; sailed from Boston on 16 June as flagship for Commander, US Naval Forces in Europe. She made goodwill visits to various ports in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and received official visits from the Kings of Norway, Denmark, and Spain, and the President of the Irish Free State. She also transported Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg between Ireland and France for the talks which led the following year to the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact.

The cruiser returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 12 September 1928, for duty with the Scouting Fleet, serving as flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Divisions, from 6 July 1929 to 29 September 1930. In January 1931, she sailed for a combined fleet problem off Balboa, then became flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Force on 19 March 1931, based on San Diego, California. In 1931, Captain Nathan Post was placed in command. &quot;Detroit&quot;″s operations included exercises along the west coast and maneuvers in Alaskan and Hawaiian waters. Except for a fleet problem in the Atlantic in 1934, she remained in the Pacific with the Battle Force, operating from her base at San Diego.

==World War II==
In 1941, &quot;Detroit&quot;″s home port became Pearl Harbor. She was moored at her base with and when the Japanese attacked on 7 December. The other two ships bore the brunt of an attack by six torpedo planes. Despite several strafing passes, &quot;Detroit&quot; was able to get underway safely and set up an anti-aircraft fire which accounted for two Japanese aircraft. &quot;Detroit&quot; was assigned to Battle Group #1 aboard was the senior Admiral, Admiral Milo Draymo, &quot;Detroit&quot; was tasked with finding the Japanese fleet the following night &quot;Detroit&quot; had met up with the USS Enterprise. Only one of &quot;Detroit&quot;″s crew members was injured during the Japanese attack, Lester Silva, who received a Purple Heart. Once clear of Pearl Harbor she was ordered to sail at once to join up with the light cruisers and and two destroyers to investigate the west coast of Oahu for any indications of a landing by the Japanese, then to join the search for the retiring Japanese force.

Returning to Pearl Harbor on 10 December, &quot;Detroit&quot; took up convoy escort duty between her home port and the West coast. On one of these voyages (on or after 3 March), she took 9 short tons (260,000 ozt; 8 metric tons) of gold and 13 short tons (350,000 ozt; 12 metric tons) of silver from (which had evacuated it from Corregidor) and delivered them to the United States Treasury Department at San Francisco. In September 1942, &quot;Detroit&quot; escorted two convoys to Naval Station Tutuila in Pago Pago, American Samoa, rescuing the crew of a downed PBY Catalina during one passage.

&quot;Detroit&quot; sailed from San Francisco on 10 November 1942 for Kodiak, Alaska, to become flagship for Commander, Task Group 8.6 (TG 8.6), and patrol between Adak and Attu Islands to prevent further enemy penetration of the Aleutians. On 12 January 1943, she covered the unopposed landings made on Amchitka to gain a base from which to cut the Japanese Supply line, and after repairs at Bremerton from February–March, returned to patrol duty to intercept reinforcements trying to reach the Japanese garrisons on Kiska and Attu. In April, she bombarded Holtz Bay and Chichagof Harbor on Attu, returning the next month to join in the assault and capture of the island. In August, under the command of Captain H. G. Sickel, she took part in the bombardments of Kiska, then covered the landings of 15 August which revealed that the island had been secretly evacuated.

&quot;Detroit&quot; remained in Alaskan waters until 1944, operating with the covering group for the western Aleutian bases. In June, she saw action with Task Force 94 (TF 94) during the bombardment of shore installations in the Kuriles. She sailed from Adak on 25 June, and after repairs at Bremerton, arrived at Balboa, Panama on 9 August to serve as temporary flagship of the Southeast Pacific Force. She patrolled on the west coast of South America until December.

Clearing San Francisco on 16 January 1945, &quot;Detroit&quot; arrived at Ulithi on 4 February for duty with the 5th Fleet. She acted as flagship for the replenishment group serving the fast carrier task forces until the end of the war, and entered Tokyo Bay on 1 September. &quot;Detroit&quot; was one of two ships present at both Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the signing of the Japanese surrender (the other being ). &quot;Detroit&quot; continued to direct replenishment operations for the Occupation fleet and in addition, the repatriation of Japanese to the home islands from Pacific bases. She left Tokyo Bay on 15 October for the United States with returning servicemen on board, as part of Operation Magic Carpet.

&quot;Detroit&quot; was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 11 January 1946, and sold for scrap on 27 February.

<text>Sydney, Lady Morgan (&quot;née&quot; Owenson; 25 December 1781? – 14 April 1859), was an Irish novelist, best known for &quot;The Wild Irish Girl&quot; (1806)&quot;,&quot; a romantic, and some critics suggest, &quot;proto-feminist&quot;, novel with political and patriotic overtones. Her work, including continental travelogues, sparked controversy and faced censorship. She counted Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron among her defenders.

== Early life ==
Sydney Owenson was the daughter of Robert Owenson, alias MacOwen, and Jane Hill. Robert Owenson was an Irish Catholic and a professional actor, noted for his comedic performances. He had been raised in London, and while in England he met and married Jane Hill, the Protestant daughter of a trader from Shrewsbury. In 1776 Owenson and his wife returned to Ireland for good. The couple settled in Dublin and Owenson earned a living by performing in theatres around Dublin, Drumcondra, and Sligo. Around 1778 the couple gave birth to Sydney, who was named after her paternal grandmother. The exact date of Sydney&#x27;s birth remains unknown; one of Sydney&#x27;s idiosyncrasies was that she was prone to be elusive about her actual age. Later in life, she would claim that she was born on 25 December 1785, a fabrication she maintained to such an extent that even on her death certificate there is no certainty about her age, stating that she was &quot;about 80 years&quot;.

Sydney spent the earliest years of her childhood at the Owensons&#x27; home at 60 Dame Street in Dublin with her mother Jane and sister Olivia. Sydney was primarily educated by her mother, but she also received tutoring from a young boy named Thomas Dermody, a local prodigy whom their father had rescued from poverty. Her mother died in 1789 when Sydney was about ten years old, and her father sent her and her sister away to private schools to finish their education. Sydney spent three years at a Huguenot academy at Clontarf and then attended a finishing school in Earl Street, Dublin. After completing school Sydney moved with her father to Sligo.

In 1798 the Owenson family was experiencing some financial hardships and Sydney was forced to leave home in search of employment. She was hired as a governess by the Featherstones of Bracklyn Castle, County Westmeath. In this environment, she blossomed into an avid reader, a capable conversationalist, and an unabashed performer of songs and dances. It was at this period in her life that she began her writing career.

==Career==

She was one of the most vivid and hotly discussed literary figures of her generation. She began her career with a precocious volume of poems. She collected Irish tunes, for which she composed the words, thus setting a fashion adopted with signal success by Thomas Moore. Her novel &quot;St. Clair&quot; (1804), about ill-judged marriage, ill-starred love and impassioned nature worship, in which the influence of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (specifically his novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau was apparent, at once attracted attention. Another novel, &quot;The Novice of St. Dominick&quot; (1806), was also praised for its qualities of imagination and description.

But the book which made her reputation and brought her name into warm controversy was &quot;The Wild Irish Girl&quot; (1806), in which she appeared as the ardent champion of her native country, a politician rather than a novelist, extolling the beauty of Irish scenery, the richness of the natural wealth of Ireland, and the noble traditions of its early history. Given the moral and intellectual strengths of her heroine, the novel&#x27;s embodiment of Irish nationhood, Glorvina, it has also been described as &quot;proto feminist&quot;. In Catholic and Liberal circles she often referred as Gloria or Glorvina..

&quot;Patriotic Sketches and Metrical Fragments&quot; followed in 1807. She published &quot;The Missionary: An Indian Tale&quot; in 1811, revising it shortly before her death as &quot;Luxima, the Prophetess&quot;. Percy Bysshe Shelley admired &quot;The Missionary&quot; intensely and Owenson&#x27;s heroine is said to have influenced some of his own orientalist productions.

Miss Owenson entered the household of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, and in 1812 — persuaded by Lady Abercorn, the former Lady Anne Jane Gore — she married the philosopher and surgeon to the household, Sir Thomas Charles Morgan, but books continued to flow from her facile pen.

A blue plaque on the wall at the site of Lady Morgan&#x27;s former home at Kildare Street, Dublin states that she lived there from 1813 to 1837. A &quot;Dublin Tourism&quot; brochure notes &quot;Lady Morgan lived at No 35 (now No 39) Kildare Street. She gave lavish soirees and musical evenings at which Thomas Moore and the violinist Paganini were among the guests&quot;. 

In 1814 she produced her best novel, &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&quot;. She was at her best in her descriptions of the poorer classes, of whom she had a thorough knowledge. Her elaborate study (1817) of France under the Bourbon Restoration was attacked with outrageous fury by John Wilson Croker in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, the author being accused of Jacobinism, falsehood, licentiousness, and impiety. Her heroines were violently removed from what Croker considered their proper sphere as &quot;a useful friend, a faithful wife, a tender mother, and a respectable and happy mistress of a family&quot;. Owenson took her revenge indirectly in the novel &quot;Florence Macarthy&quot; (1818) —translated into French by Jacques-Théodore Parisot—, in which a &quot;Quarterly&quot; reviewer, Con Crawley, is insulted with supreme feminine ingenuity.

&quot;Italy&quot;, a companion work to her &quot;France&quot;, was published in 1821 with appendices by her husband. It was proscribed by the King of Sardinia, the Emperor of Austria and the Pope, but Lord Byron bore testimony to the justness of its pictures of life. The results of Italian historical studies were given in her &quot;Life and Times of Salvator Rosa&quot; (1823). Then she turned again to Irish manners and politics with a matter-of-fact book on &quot;Absenteeism&quot; (1825), and a romantic novel with political overtones, &quot;The O&#x27;Briens and the O&#x27;Flahertys&quot; (1827). From William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, Lady Morgan obtained a pension of £300. During the later years of her long life she published &quot;The Book of the Boudoir&quot; (1829), &quot;Dramatic Scenes from Real Life&quot; (1833), &quot;The Princess&quot; (1835), &quot;Woman and her Master&quot; (1840), &quot;The Book without a Name&quot; (1841), and &quot;Passages from my Autobiography&quot; (1859).

In 1838, Sir Thomas and Lady Morgan moved to a new home on the Cubitt estate, Knightsbridge, near Lowndes Square. Lady Morgan began a successful campaign to have a new gate opened into Hyde Park from Knightsbridge, the present day Albert Gate.

Sir Thomas died in 1843, and Lady Morgan died on 14 April 1859 (aged about 82) and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Legacy==

Before her death in 1859, Lady Morgan enlisted the help of her friend Geraldine Jewsbury to help write her memoirs. The two had originally met in 1853 when Jewsbury newly arrived in London. Lady Morgan became friends with Geraldine and helped her live a single life while in London. When Jewsbury wrote her friend&#x27;s memoirs, she spoke of Lady Morgan&#x27;s kindness and friendship in which she showed to Geraldine.
Lady Morgan&#x27;s autobiography and many interesting letters were edited with a memoir by William Hepworth Dixon in 1862.

There is a bust of Lady Morgan in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The plaque identifying the bust mentions that Lady Morgan was &quot;less than four feet tall.&quot;

Another bust by David d&#x27;Angers is exhibited in his museum in Angers (France).

<text>The Shimba Hills National Reserve is a small National Reserve in the former Coast Province of Kenya, 33 km from Mombasa and 15 km from the coast. The reserve is an area of coastal rainforest, woodland and grassland. It is an important area for plant biodiversity – over 50% of the 159 rare plants in Kenya are found in the Shimba Hills, including some endangered species of cycad and orchids. It is also a nationally important site for birds and butterflies.

There are estimated to be approximately 700 elephants in the reserve. This population is unsustainably high – it causes significant damage to vegetation, threatening the endangered plant life. The conflict between humans and elephants has also reached critical levels. North of the reserve, the Mwaluganje Elephant Sanctuary has been established to provide a route for elephants to leave the park. The remainder of the park boundary is fenced to prevent the elephants from invading farmland. The Kenya Wildlife Service has plans to relocate up to 400 elephants from Shimba to Tsavo East National Park in 2005.

Shimba Hills contains Kenya&#x27;s only population of sable antelope. There are about 100 in the park.

<doc id="1098698" wikidata="Q6127634" url="?curid=1098698" title="USS Trenton (CL-11)">
<text>USS &quot;Trenton&quot; (CL-11) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship named for the city of Trenton, New Jersey. She spent most of her pre-war career moving between the Atlantic and the Pacific. &quot;Trenton&quot; joined the Special Service Squadron in 1934, for a good-will tour of Latin America. In May 1939, she would join Squadron 40-T in protecting American interests during the Spanish Civil War and not return to the US until July 1940, when she carried the royal family of Luxembourg, fleeing from the Nazi occupation of their country.

==Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
&quot;Trenton&quot; was authorized on 1 July 1918, and assigned to William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia on 24 January 1919. She was laid down on 18 August 1920, and launched on 16 April 1923, sponsored by Miss Katherine E. Donnelly, daughter of the mayor of Trenton at the time, Frederick W. Donnelly. &quot;Trenton&quot; was commissioned on 3 November 1923, with future Admiral, Captain Edward C. Kalbfus in command.

&quot;Trenton&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Trenton&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 

&quot;Trenton&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Trenton&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Trenton&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Trenton&quot; went through several armament changes, some of these changes were save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Inter-war period==
On 24 May 1924, she stood out of New York Harbor for her shakedown cruise in the Mediterranean Sea. On 14 August 1924, while in transit from Port Said, Egypt, to Aden, Arabia, she was ordered to Bushire, Persia. She arrived on 25 August, and took on board the remains of Vice Consul Robert Imbrie. She received and returned the gun salute to the late vice consul and departed the same day. Following stops at Suez and Port Said, Egypt; and at Villefranche, France; &quot;Trenton&quot; arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on 29 September 1924.

On 20 October 1924, while &quot;Trenton&quot; was conducting gunnery drills off the Virginia Capes near Norfolk, powder bags in her forward turret exploded, killing or injuring every member of the gun crew. During the ensuing fire, Ensign Henry Clay Drexler and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate First Class George Cholister attempted to dump powder charges into the immersion tank before they detonated but failed. Ensign Drexler was killed when the charge exploded, and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Cholister was overcome by fire and fumes before he could reach his objective. He died the following day. Both men were awarded the Medal of Honor, posthumously.

Later that month, &quot;Trenton&quot; steamed north to join in the futile search for lost American motor yacht &quot;Leif Ericsson&quot;, which went missing with three aboard while en route from Bergen, Norway, to the United States. The search was suspended on 12 November as further attempts to locate it were deemed &quot;futile&quot; in light of the heavy weather in the region during the two months since the vessel was last heard from. Lost were William W. Nutting and Arthur Hildebrand, American writers, and Eric Todahal, a painter. Following that mission, the light cruiser operated along the United States East Coast until 3 February 1925, when she departed Philadelphia to join the rest of the Scouting Fleet off Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After gunnery exercises, the fleet headed for the Panama Canal and transited it in mid-month. On 23 February, the combined forces of the Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet departed Balboa, Panama, and steamed north to San Diego. &quot;En route&quot;, the ships participated in a fleet problem, then assembled in the San Diego-San Francisco area. On 15 April, the US Fleet put to sea for the Central Pacific and conducted another battle problem &quot;en route&quot; — this one designed to test fully the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands. After reaching Hawaiian waters, the Fleet as a whole conducted tactical exercises there until 7 June, when most of the Scouting Fleet headed back toward the Atlantic.

&quot;Trenton&quot; — in Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv 2) — sortied with the Battle Fleet on 1 July, for a cruise to the South Pacific and visits to Australia and New Zealand. After stopping at Samoa, the ships visited the ports of Melbourne, Wellington, Sydney, Auckland, Dunedin, and Lyttelton. Late in August, CruDiv 2 turned homeward and steamed via the Marquesas and Galapagos Islands and the Panama Canal to rejoin the Scouting Fleet near Guantanamo Bay on 4 October. After gunnery practice, &quot;Trenton&quot; returned to Philadelphia on 9 November.

In January 1926, &quot;Trenton&quot; joined the other units of the Scouting Fleet and returned to Guantanamo for gunnery drills and tactical exercises. On 1 February, she departed Cuba with them, bound for Panama. For the next six weeks, she participated in combined maneuvers with units of both Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet. In mid-March, the units of the Scouting Fleet returned to their home yards for repairs before leaving for summer training cruises with naval reservists and tactical exercises in the area around Narragansett Bay. In mid-September, she returned to Guantanamo Bay for winter maneuvers.

&quot;Trenton&quot; participated in maneuvers until just before 25 December, when the units of the Scouting Fleet dispersed to their home ports for the holidays. Early in 1927, she joined the Scouting Fleet in combined maneuvers with the Battle Fleet near Guantanamo Bay. In May, &quot;Trenton&quot; was called upon to transport Colonel Henry L. Stimson, a special observer in Nicaragua during a period of internal disorder. She embarked Colonel and Mrs. Stimson at Corinto and carried them back to Hampton Roads. Following a review by President Coolidge in June, the various units of the two fleets departed Hampton Roads for their normal summer routines. CruDiv 2, of which &quot;Trenton&quot; was flagship, operated off Narragansett Bay; then, in the fall, rejoined the Scouting Fleet for gunnery and tactical exercises along the east coast between Chesapeake Bay and Charleston, South Carolina.

In January 1928, &quot;Trenton&quot; and her division embarked Marines at Charleston and returned to Nicaragua, where they landed to assist in supervising the elections which resulted from Colonel Stimson&#x27;s visit. She and her sister-ships rejoined the Scouting Fleet at Guantanamo and resumed maneuvers. On 9 March, CruDiv 2 parted company with the Scouting Fleet. The four light cruisers rendezvoused with the Battle Fleet off the California coast and headed for Hawaii, conducting drills en route. After exercises in the Hawaiian Islands, &quot;Trenton&quot; and cleared Honolulu to relieve CruDiv 3 on the Asiatic Station. During that tour of duty, she entertained Colonel Stimson, this time as Governor General of the Philippines. She participated in joint Army-Navy maneuvers in the Philippines and patrolled the northern Chinese coast. By late March 1929, &quot;Trenton&quot; was stationed at Zhifu to prevent a possible outbreak of anti-foreigner pogroms due to the Warlord Rebellion in northeastern Shandong. On one occasion, she put a landing force ashore at Zhifu.

In May 1929, Trenton&#x27;s division was detached from the Asiatic Fleet, and she steamed back to the United States along with &quot;Memphis&quot; and . The light cruiser was overhauled at Philadelphia in the latter part of 1929, and then rejoined the Scouting Fleet. For the next four years, &quot;Trenton&quot; resumed the Scouting Fleet schedule of winter maneuvers in the Caribbean followed by summer exercises off the New England coast. Periodically, however, she was ordered to the Isthmian coast to bolster the Special Service Squadron during periods of extreme political unrest in one or more of the republics of Central America.

In the spring of 1933, &quot;Trenton&quot; moved to the Pacific and became flagship of the Battle Force cruisers. She operated in the eastern Pacific until September 1934. At that time, the ship returned to the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal to cruise with the Special Service Squadron. Over the next 15 months, Trenton visited ports in the Caribbean, in Central America, and South America as the squadron conducted a good-will cruise to Latin America. In January 1936, she retransited the canal and, after an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard, rejoined the Battle Force until late in the spring of 1939. During that period, she made her second cruise to Australia in the winter of 1937 and 1938, for the sesquicentennial of the first colonization of that continent.

In May 1939, she returned to the Atlantic and, after a stop at Hampton Roads, got underway on 3 June for Europe. There she joined Squadron 40-T, a small American naval force which had been organized in 1936, to evacuate United States citizens from Spain and to protect American interests during the Spanish Civil War. &quot;Trenton&quot; patrolled the western Mediterranean and waters off the coast of the Iberian peninsula until mid-July 1940, when she returned to the United States. During her homeward voyage, the light cruiser carried Luxembourg&#x27;s royal family then in flight from Nazi aggression.

==World War II==
In November, &quot;Trenton&quot; reentered the Pacific and rejoined the Battle Force, becoming an element of CruDiv 3. From 1941 to mid-1944, the ship served with the Southeast Pacific Force. At the time of America&#x27;s entry into the war early in December 1941, she was moored at Balboa, Canal Zone. During the early part of 1942, Trenton escorted convoys to Bora Bora in the Society Islands where the Navy was constructing a fuel depot. From mid-1942 to mid-1944, she patrolled the western coast of South America between the Canal Zone and the Strait of Magellan. During one of these sweeps, on 29 August 1943, while patrolling some 150 nm southeast of Tonga, &quot;Trenton&quot; received a radar contact which lasted for 15 minutes, but the American commander disregarded it as a regular merchant vessel. They actually missed the German raider &quot;Michel&quot;, which on 11 September intercepted and sank the Norwegian tanker &quot;India&quot; with all hands.

On 18 July 1944, &quot;Trenton&quot; headed north for duty in waters surrounding the Aleutians. After stopping for a time at San Francisco, she arrived at Adak, Alaska, on 2 September. A month later, she shifted bases to Attu. In October, &quot;Trenton&quot; joined and nine destroyers in two sweeps of the northern Kuril Islands — the first from 16–19 October, and the second from 22–29 October — as a diversion during the invasion of Leyte. She returned to the Kurils again on 3 January 1945, to bombard enemy installations on Paramushiru Island, then resumed Alaskan patrols.

For the remainder of the war, &quot;Trenton&quot; patrolled the waters off Alaska and the Aleutian Islands and made periodic sweeps of the Kuril Islands. On 18 February, she returned to Paramushiru to pound shore installations. A month later, she bombarded Matsuwa. On 10 June, the light cruiser shelled Matsuwa once more and made an anti-shipping sweep before conducting another bombardment during the evening hours of 11 June. From 23–25 June, &quot;Trenton&quot;, conducted her last offensive operation of the war, an anti-shipping sweep of the central Kuriles. Task Force 94 (TF 94) split into two units. &quot;Trenton&quot; encountered no enemy shipping, but the other unit sank five ships of a small convoy.

Not long after that operation, the light cruiser steamed south for yard work. She reached San Francisco on 1 August, and the end of the war found her at Mare Island Navy Yard awaiting inactivation overhaul. Early in November, she headed south to Panama. &quot;Trenton&quot; transited the canal on 18 November, arrived at Philadelphia a week later, and was placed out of commission there on 20 December. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 21 January 1946. On 29 December, she was delivered to her purchaser, the Patapsco Scrap Co. of Bethlehem, Pa., for scrapping.

<text>The Grafton Ballroom was an entertainment centre in Liverpool, England that on opened on 9 February 1924. it was a purpose-built dance hall able to accommodate 1,200 dancers. It was built next to the Locarno Ballroom which is now known as the Liverpool Olympia. It has for several years been under the same ownership as the Olympia.

Joe Loss, Victor Silvester, Henry Hall, Duke Ellington, Anathema and The Beatles have all played &quot;The Grafton&quot;.

In late September 2008 the Grafton closed as a dance venue, to be refurbished and reopened as a comedy club.

<text>Dorothy Dell (born Dorothy Dell Goff; January 30, 1915 – June 8, 1934) was an American film actress. She died in an auto accident at the age of 19.

==Early life and career==
Born Dorothy Dell Goff in Hattiesburg, Mississippi to entertainers, she moved with the family to New Orleans, Louisiana, at age 13. She was born into a socially prominent family, and her mother was a descendant of Jefferson Davis. Initially desiring to become a singer, she was discovered by composer Wesley Lord, and soon signed a radio contract. She began entering and winning beauty pageants and at the age of 17 won the title of &quot;Miss New Orleans&quot; in 1930. That same year she attended the International Pageant of Pulchritude in Galveston, Texas, and won the title of &quot;Miss Universe&quot; (not to be confused with the later Miss Universe founded in 1952). With this success, she established a successful vaudeville act. Although she had received better offers, she decided to enter the vaudeville circuit, because she believed it would enable her to help her friend Dorothy Lamour rise to fame, a promise she had made shortly before winning the Miss Universe title at the Pageant.

After working on the vaudeville circuit for 32 weeks, she moved to New York in 1931. One night, she sang at a benefit and was discovered by Florenz Ziegfeld, who arranged for her to appear on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies, and she followed this success with her role in the production of &quot;Tattle Tales&quot; in 1933. During this time she was closely associated with Russ Colombo, and her celebrity status was elevated by the media attention she received while denying rumors of an impending marriage. Dell and Columbo had met at her Ziegfeld audition; Columbo&#x27;s manager, Con Conrad, was determined to end their relationship and did so with a series of &quot;publicity only&quot; romances between Columbo and other, more famous actresses.

She moved to Hollywood in December 1933 and was signed to a contract by Paramount Pictures. Initially being contracted for bit parts, she won her first film role over such established contenders as Mae Clarke and Isabel Jewell and made her debut in &quot;Wharf Angel&quot; (1934). The film was a success and the reviews for Dell were favorable; Paramount began to consider her as a potential star. Her most important and substantial role followed in the Shirley Temple film &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;.

==Death==
On Friday, June 8, 1934, Dell agreed to a car ride to Pasadena with 38-year-old Dr. Carl Wagner, because he insisted that she take some time for relaxation between retakes of &quot;Shoot the Works&quot;, and to meet his mother, whom he wanted to show &quot;how sweet a little movie star can be.&quot; After the meeting, they went to an all-night party at an inn in Altadena, California. Afterward they were going to Pasadena when the car left the highway, hit a telephone pole, bounced off a palm tree and hit a boulder. Dell was killed instantly. Wagner, who was driving between 50 and 70 miles an hour, died six hours later in a hospital.

It has been claimed that she was engaged to Wagner, but this was dismissed by different sources, who believed that she was to be married to caricaturist Nat Carson, whom she met while performing as a chorus girl in Earl Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Vanities&quot;. A week before her death, Carson left for work in London and proposed over the telephone. Dell planned on taking off six months for an extended honeymoon vacation. When Carson found out about her death, he decided not to return to Broadway, and he remained in London.

According to news reports, a day before her death, Dell mused: &quot;You know, they say deaths go in cycles of three. First it was Lilyan Tashman, then Lew Cody. I wonder who&#x27;ll be next?&quot;

Dell was interred in Metairie Cemetery, in New Orleans, Louisiana. 

During her life, Dell had claimed several encounters with near-death experiences. As a child, she narrowly escaped death when being attacked by a dog. The dog was killed by her father to save Dell&#x27;s life. In 1931, while at the Follies, she was invited to board a yacht for a party of Harry Richman. She declined, and the girl who took her place died in an explosion on board. A few weeks later she was critically injured following a car accident and hospitalized for two months. Furthermore, she fell ill with influenza shortly afterwards and broke a leg during a Follies performance.

==Legacy==
Dell&#x27;s role in &quot;Now and Forever&quot; was recast with Carole Lombard, and provided Lombard with one of her earliest significant successes. The news of Dell&#x27;s death was kept from her dear friend Temple until filming started on the scene in which Temple&#x27;s character discovers that her father had lied to her about stealing the necklace. When Temple threw herself on the bed and cried bitter tears, the tears were genuine, being connected to her friend&#x27;s death.

Dorothy Lamour won the title of &quot;Miss New Orleans&quot; in 1931, succeeding her friend Dell who had won the title the previous year.

<text>The Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA) is the mass transit provider for Chattanooga, Tennessee and its vicinity.

Public transportation first appeared on the streets of Chattanooga on September 4, 1875, utilizing horse-drawn trollies. The two main routes followed Market Street and East Ninth Street (now Martin Luther King Boulevard). In 1889, the trolleys were replaced with electric streetcars. With the advent of the internal combustion engine, buses began to appear more frequently. In 1941, Southern Coach Lines took over the public transit operations, and the last streetcar ran in 1946.

==City control==
In 1973, the City of Chattanooga purchased the assets of the former Southern Coach Lines, and formed the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority. 

CARTA operates 15 bus routes, trimmed down from 30, as some routes have been consolidated or eliminated. Since 1992, CARTA has operated a free downtown shuttle bus service, utilizing electric buses, which runs between the Chattanooga Choo Choo (the former Terminal Station) and the Tennessee Aquarium. Public parking is available at both locations. CARTA owns and operates the historic Lookout Mountain Incline Railway, which ascends from the St. Elmo neighborhood to the town of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee as well as the Chattanooga Parking Authority. CARTA also provides paratransit van services, called CARTA Care-A-Van.

<doc id="1098713" wikidata="Q58608" url="?curid=1098713" title="Arcade Fire">
<text>Arcade Fire is a Canadian indie rock band from Montreal, Quebec, consisting of husband and wife Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, alongside Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury and Jeremy Gara. The band&#x27;s touring line-up also includes former core member Sarah Neufeld and multi-instrumentalists Paul Beaubrun and Dan Boeckner. Each of the band&#x27;s studio albums features contributions from composer and violinist Owen Pallett.

Founded in 2001 by friends and classmates Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to prominence in 2004 with the release of their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Funeral&quot;. Their second studio album, &quot;Neon Bible&quot;, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, &quot;The Suburbs&quot;, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success. It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, &quot;Reflektor&quot;, and scored the feature film &quot;Her&quot;, for which band members Will Butler and Owen Pallett were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2017, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Everything Now&quot;, which was succeeded by their sixth studio album &quot;We&quot; in 2022.

All the band&#x27;s studio albums have received nominations for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammys. &quot;Funeral&quot; is widely considered by music critics to be one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. The band&#x27;s work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for &quot;Neon Bible&quot;, in 2011 for &quot;The Suburbs&quot; and in 2014 for &quot;Reflektor&quot;.

The band has been described as indie rock, art rock, dance-rock, and baroque pop. They play guitar, drums, bass guitar, piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, keyboard, synthesizer, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin and hurdy-gurdy, and take most of these instruments on tour; the multi-instrumentalist band members switch duties throughout shows.

==History==
===2001–2003: Formation and early work===
Win Butler and Josh Deu founded Arcade Fire in Montreal around 2001, having first met at Phillips Exeter Academy as high school students. Butler and Deu&#x27;s musical ideas began to develop and the first incarnation of the band was born while they were attending McGill University and Concordia University, respectively. The duo began rehearsing their material at McGill where they met Régine Chassagne, a music student whom they asked to join them. Deu recalls, &quot;Win and I played guitar. Everyone played guitar. We had no music to show her, but she ended up saying yes to joining us, and I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe there was a little spark with Win.&quot; Halfway through 2001, the band consisted of Butler, Chassagne, Deu, multi-instrumentalist Tim Kile (later of Wild Light), bassist Myles Broscoe (later of Les Angles Morts, Crystal Clyffs, and AIDS Wolf), guitarist/drummer Dane Mills (later of Crackpot) and multi-instrumentalist Brendan Reed (later of Les Angles Morts and founding member of Clues), who lived with Butler and Chassagne in Montreal&#x27;s Mile End neighbourhood at the time and was a collaborator with them on song-writing and arrangement (2001–2003). During a party in 2001, the band recorded a live Christmas album, &quot;A Very Arcade Xmas&quot;, which they are rumored to have hand-distributed to their friends as a Christmas gift.

The initial Montreal structure of the band began to dissolve in the summer of 2002, when they travelled to Butler&#x27;s family farm on Mount Desert Island, Maine to record their self-titled EP. Tension between Butler and bassist Myles Broscoe led the latter to exit the band following the recording session. Richard Reed Parry, who had been enlisted to help the band record, began to collaborate with them during the sessions and would go on to join the band shortly afterwards. Around the same time, Joshua Deu left the band to resume his studies; he continued to collaborate on the visual aspects of the band. In the winter of 2003, the band celebrated the release of its EP with a show at Montreal&#x27;s Casa del Popolo. Before a crowd packed beyond capacity, the band&#x27;s set ended (in the middle of an encore) with an argument between Butler and Reed, who quit the band on-stage. Mills told gathered friends in the crowd immediately thereafter that he considered the band to have broken up, as such resigning from the band as well. Following the on-stage implosion, Butler&#x27;s brother Will Butler (subject of the early Arcade Fire song &quot;William Pierce Butler&quot;) and Tim Kingsbury were brought in to replace Reed and Mills so that the band could continue, and they set out to promote the self-titled EP. The eponymous release (often referred to by fans as the &quot;Us Kids Know EP&quot;) was sold at early shows. After the band achieved fame, the EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release.

Howard Bilerman joined the band on drums in the summer of 2003, and they began to play shows together, and record the album that would end up becoming &quot;Funeral&quot;. The promise shown by the new band in their early live shows allowed them to land a record contract with the independent record label, Merge Records, before the end of their first year together.

When asked about the rumour that the band&#x27;s name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: &quot;It&#x27;s not a rumour, it&#x27;s based on a story that someone told me. It&#x27;s not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it&#x27;s probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him.&quot;

===2004–2006: &quot;Funeral&quot;===

&quot;Funeral&quot; was released in September 2004 in Canada and February 2005 in Great Britain. The title of the debut album referred to the deaths of several relatives of band members (prominently the Butlers&#x27; grandfather, composer/arranger Alvino Rey) during its recording. These events created a somber atmosphere that influenced songs such as &quot;Une année sans lumière&quot; (&quot;A Year Without Light&quot;), &quot;In the Backseat&quot;, and &quot;Haïti&quot;, Chassagne&#x27;s elegy to her homeland.

It received widespread critical acclaim and topped many year-end and decade-end lists. According to the website Metacritic, the album had the second most appearances on end-of-decade Top 10 lists, only behind Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;. In the updated version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it was ranked at No. 151.

The album was critically and commercially acclaimed. It appeared on many top ten album lists for 2004 and 2005 (due to delayed international releases), with Pitchfork, &quot;Filter&quot;, No Ripcord, and The MTV2 2005 Review crowning it the album of the year. &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Funeral&quot; second in their list of 2005&#x27;s best albums. NME also named &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot; the second best track.
By November 2005, &quot;Funeral&quot; had gone gold in both Canada and the UK, and sold over half a million copies worldwide, a very large number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. The album became Merge Records&#x27; first in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the label&#x27;s biggest selling album to date, surpassing Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;.
The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour, but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band&#x27;s expectations, and the tour continued into mid-2005 throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, the SummerSonic Festival in Japan, and the Hillside Festival in Guelph. Taking much of the summer of 2005 off, the band made key festival appearances at the Halifax Pop Explosion, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Vegoose Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival in the UK, Electric Picnic in Ireland and the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands.

Arcade Fire was featured on the April 4, 2005, cover of &quot;Time&quot;″s Canadian edition. On May 1, 2005, the band performed at the Coachella Valley Music &amp; Arts Festival. In May 2005, the band signed a short-term publishing contract with EMI for &quot;Funeral&quot;, and in June the band released a new single, &quot;Cold Wind&quot;, on &quot;Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends&quot;. The BBC used the track &quot;Wake Up&quot; on an advertisement for their autumn 2005 season, and the tracks &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)&quot; on adverts in January 2006. On September 9, 2005, the band appeared on the British/US television special &quot;Fashion Rocks&quot;, on which David Bowie joined them for &quot;Wake Up&quot;. This recording, as well as recordings of the band&#x27;s collaboration on Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars&quot; and &quot;Five Years&quot;, were made available on the iTunes Music Store in a virtual live EP. The same trip to New York City took them to the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and a concert in Central Park. The Central Park show featured a surprise appearance by Bowie. On September 11, 2005, Arcade Fire appeared on the long-running BBC music series &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot;. The band also performed to a TV audience in Paris for Canal+, and the show was later screened on the British television&#x27;s Channel 4. The band scored two number one songs on MTV2 (UK) &quot;NME&quot; Chart Show, with &quot;Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)&quot; and a three-week run with &quot;Wake Up&quot;. This success followed Rough Trade Records&#x27;s last-minute decision to release &quot;Wake Up&quot; only on 7&quot;
vinyl.

&quot;Wake Up&quot; was played immediately before the Irish rock group U2 started their concerts on their 2005–06 Vertigo Tour; Arcade Fire subsequently opened three shows for that tour, and at the third in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, appeared on stage during U2&#x27;s encore to join in a cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;. Additionally, &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, a daily national sports talk show in the US, plays the song as a lead-out every Friday to signify the end of their show. The song was also heard numerous times during the Super Bowl telecast on February 5, 2010.

&quot;Funeral&quot; and the single &quot;Cold Wind&quot; were nominated for Grammys in the Best Alternative Rock Album and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media categories (&quot;Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends&quot;), respectively. On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Arcade Fire received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from &quot;Funeral&quot;: &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot;, and &quot;Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)&quot;. The band was nominated for three BRIT Awards: Best International Group, Best International Album, and Best International Breakthrough Act.

Arcade Fire made an appearance on the BBC show &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; on May 12, 2005, performing &quot;Power Out&quot; and &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot;. On October 22, 2007, &quot;Funeral&quot; was ranked No.8 in Bob Mersereau&#x27;s book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;. In late 2009, Pitchfork ranked the album No.2 in their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, behind Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Kid A&quot;.

===2006–2010: &quot;Neon Bible&quot;===
During the downtime between &quot;Funeral&quot; and the beginning of recording sessions for &quot;Neon Bible&quot;, the band purchased a defunct church in the small Quebec town of Farnham, approximately southeast of Montreal, and spent the early part of 2006 converting it into a recording studio.

The first track officially released from &quot;Neon Bible&quot; was &quot;Intervention&quot; in December 2006 on iTunes. Proceeds from this release were dedicated to Partners in Health. An error resulted in a second song, &quot;Black Wave/Bad Vibrations&quot;, appearing on iTunes for a short time. The album was leaked to peer-to-peer networks on January 26, 2007, and was officially released March 5, 2007 in the UK and March 6 in North America. &quot;Neon Bible&quot; premiered at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Charts, and number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 charts and the UK Top 40 Album Chart for the week of March 12, 2007. The album was also number 1 on the Rock and Indie album charts. The first proper single, &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, reached the No. 1 spot on CBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;R3-30&quot; chart for five consecutive weeks, from March 22 to April 19, 2007, and was the first single by any band ever to spend more than two weeks atop the chart. The album gained much critical acclaim (even being mooted as a strong contender for album of the year), and because of its success saw the band proclaimed the most exciting act on the earth by British music magazine &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; voted it one of the five best albums of 2007. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; writer Jason Reeher ranked &quot;Neon Bible&quot; &quot;among the best indie rock recordings of all time&quot;.

Arcade Fire made their first appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Keep the Car Running&quot;. Owen Pallett was not present as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler&#x27;s guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash it on the floor until it shattered. On this guitar, &quot;sak vide pa kanpe&quot; was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning &quot;An empty sack cannot stand up&quot; in Creole, this may have been a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne.
On July 10, 2007, &quot;Neon Bible&quot; was named to the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007. However, due to the band&#x27;s preference not to participate in compilation albums, they were the only nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.

The &quot;Neon Bible&quot; tour continued into September 2007 with 25+ dates scheduled in North America and Europe through mid-November. The band toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in early 2008 as part of the 2008 Big Day Out festival. On October 14, 2007, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne made a surprise guest appearance at a Bruce Springsteen show in Ottawa, playing &quot;State Trooper&quot; and &quot;Keep the Car Running&quot;. The band committed to give Partners in Health $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on its 2008 European and North American tours.

Arcade Fire further helped PIH, when it recorded &quot;Lenin&quot; on Red Hot Organization&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;. Sales from DWTN generated over $850,000 in money donated to AIDS related charities—$300,000 of which was given to PIH on Arcade Fire&#x27;s behalf.

In February 2008, Win Butler announced on the band&#x27;s journal that the &quot;Neon Bible&quot; tour had come to an end, after one year of touring and a total of 122 shows (including 33 festivals) in 75 cities and 19 countries.
Critics met the self-produced &quot;Neon Bible&quot; with acclaim. Publications like &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; praised the album for its grandiose nature.

Win Butler has been a vocal supporter of Barack Obama since the end of the New Hampshire Primary. Arcade Fire performed two free concerts for Obama in Cleveland and Nelsonville, Ohio on March 2 and 3, 2008, before the state&#x27;s March 4 primary. The band, with Superchunk, performed another two free concerts for Obama on May 1 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and on May 2 in Carrboro, North Carolina before the state&#x27;s May 6 primary. On January 21, 2009, Arcade Fire and Jay-Z were the musical guests at the Obama Campaign Staff Ball at the DC Armory, at Obama&#x27;s request. Butler thanked President Obama for his stated intent to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and repeatedly thanked the Obama staffers for their work during the election.

The band was rumoured to be working with producer Markus Dravs on the soundtrack for the Richard Kelly film &quot;The Box&quot;. Win Butler denied the claims, but stated that he and Owen Pallett &quot;may do an instrumental piece or two&quot; for the film.

In December 2008, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reported the band set up the website miroir-noir.com to foreshadow the release of a concert film with the same title, reporting, &quot;Miroir Noir will feature live footage from the Neon Bible tour.&quot; The film was directed by Vincent Morisset. It was made available to pre-order on December 15, 2008, with the digital version available to download immediately, and the DVD shipping March 31, 2009.

A re-recorded version of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Wake Up&quot; from their 2004 debut album, &quot;Funeral&quot;, was used for the trailer of the Spike Jonze film &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, which was released in October 2009. The song &quot;Wake Up&quot; has also become popular on sports radio talk shows in the US In 2009, two nationally syndicated shows—&quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot; and &quot;The Petros and Money Show&quot;—frequently used the song as &quot;bumper&quot; music. The National Football League featured this recording in commercials throughout the broadcast of the 2010 Super Bowl. The band donated the proceeds from licensing the song to the NFL to the charity Partners In Health.

===2010–2012: &quot;The Suburbs&quot;===

On May 27, 2010, it was announced that a new double-sided 12&quot; single would be released the same day as the full album, called &quot;The Suburbs&quot;, on August 2 in the UK and on August 3 in the US and Canada. The album is produced by Markus Dravs, who had worked with the band on their previous album, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Neon Bible,&quot; and was engineered by Marcus Paquin, who has also previously worked with the band. A track-by-track review ahead of &quot;The Suburbs&quot; release by The Quietus website said, &quot;The progression is similar to the one William Blake takes us through in &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; that suggests forward momentum and maturity.&quot; The album was released with eight different covers.

The first show announced was Oxegen 2010 which took place in Ireland in July. The band announced that they would play songs from the new album in their headline performance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2010, with Win Butler noting, &quot;We&#x27;re really looking forward to playing the new songs live... [it&#x27;s] like an inventor emerging from his basement after a year&#x27;s work.&quot;
In July 2010, Arcade Fire announced they would be broadcasting their August 5 concert at Madison Square Garden live via YouTube. They later announced the video would be directed by Terry Gilliam. &quot;The Suburbs&quot; was released worldwide at the start of August 2010 to extensive critical acclaim comparable to &quot;Funeral&quot; and &quot;Neon Bible&quot;. During the 2010 tour, Arcade Fire gave a tribute to Jay Reatard performing the cover of &quot;Oh, It&#x27;s Such a Shame&quot;. Win Butler confessed to Zane Lowe that the band wanted Jay Reatard to support the band on this tour, but he had died. &quot;The Suburbs&quot; went on to debut at number one in the US (on the Billboard 200), selling 156,000 units in its first week. It was also number one in the UK and Canada.

In August 2010, Arcade Fire and Google released an interactive music video, written and directed by Chris Milk and produced by B-Reel, which allows the viewer to enter the address where they grew up and the video is then &quot;geopersonalised&quot;. This video utilizes the band&#x27;s song &quot;We Used to Wait&quot; from &quot;The Suburbs&quot;, and showcases capabilities of HTML5 and Google&#x27;s Chrome browser. On November 13, 2010, Arcade Fire made their second appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, performing &quot;We Used to Wait&quot; and &quot;Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)&quot;.

The album debuted at No. 1 on the Irish Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and the Canadian Albums Chart. It won Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards, Best International Album at the 2011 BRIT Awards, Album of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards, and the 2011 Polaris Music Prize for best Canadian album. Two weeks after winning Grammy&#x27;s Album of the Year, the album jumped from No. 52 to No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album&#x27;s highest ranking since August 2010.

In a nod to the Butlers&#x27; maternal grandfather, Alvino Rey, who was an amateur radio operator, the logo used by the band from this time was a variation of that used by the American Radio Relay League. Also, when playing the single &quot;We Used to Wait&quot; live, the background video screen features a radio exchange between Rey and a Canadian operator having Call Sign VE3YV. The video also features many other amateur radio artifacts.

Arcade Fire performed at the 53rd Grammy Awards in February 2011. The band was nominated for Grammy Awards in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Best Alternative Music Album (for&quot; The Suburbs&quot;). Out of the three nominations, they won the Grammy for Album of the Year, their second time to be nominated for the award.

At the 2011 BRIT Awards, &quot;The Suburbs&quot; won Best International Album, and Arcade Fire won the Award for Best International Group.

In March 2011, Arcade Fire was honoured at the Juno Awards of 2011. They won Group of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for &quot;Ready to Start&quot;, &quot;Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)&quot;, and &quot;We Used to Wait&quot;, all off &quot;The Suburbs&quot;. &quot;The Suburbs&quot; also won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year.

On April 19, 2011, it was announced that Arcade Fire would release a deluxe edition of their album &quot;The Suburbs&quot; featuring the short film &quot;Scenes from the Suburbs&quot;, by director Spike Jonze, as well as two new tracks, &quot;Culture War&quot; and &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; featuring David Byrne. &quot;Scenes from the Suburbs&quot;, which debuted at the Berlin International Film Festival 2011, has a running time of 30 minutes. The film screened at the SXSW Film Festival 2011 and saw its online premiere on MUBI on June 27, 2011. Writing for the Canadian Press, Nick Patch called the film &quot;a sci-fi puzzler that seems to blend the paranoia of Terry Gilliam films with the nostalgia of classic Steven Spielberg flicks.&quot;

On June 16, the album was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize. On July 6, the album was named as a shortlisted (one of 10) nominee for the 2011 award. On September 20, 2011, they were awarded the Polaris Prize.

On May 19, 2012, Arcade Fire (minus members Will and Tim) made their third appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, playing as a backup band for musical guest and host Mick Jagger. The band performed &quot;The Last Time&quot; with Jagger, and participated in Kristen Wiig&#x27;s farewell skit, playing &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot; into &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;. The band wore &quot;carrés rouges&quot; (red squares) to show support for the 2012 Quebec student protests.

Arcade Fire recorded a song for &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; soundtrack (&quot;The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond&quot;), called &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The song is featured in the movie&#x27;s end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It&#x27;s the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;This Is It&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).

Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie&#x27;s original score, &quot;The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score&quot;. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled &quot;Horn of Plenty&quot;, an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. &quot;We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,&quot; Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. &quot;And there&#x27;s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It&#x27;s like the Capitol&#x27;s idea of itself, basically.&quot; He further added that &quot;it&#x27;s not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.&quot; Arcade Fire&#x27;s Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to &quot;Spin Mobile&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Horn of Plenty&#x27; sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem.&quot;

=== 2013–2015: &quot;Reflektor&quot; ===
Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band&#x27;s manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with regular producer of the band Markus Dravs and James Murphy, frontman of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website set the release date on October 28, 2013.
The band announced on January 18, 2013, that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios – including Murphy&#x27;s DFA Records studio in New York City. On June 22, 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013. On July 12, the band announced via a reply on Twitter that their new album would be released on October 29.

Arcade Fire members Will Butler and Owen Pallett received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards for their original score of Spike Jonze&#x27;s 2013 science-fiction romance film &quot;Her&quot;. Speculation emerged in August that the album would be named &quot;Reflektor&quot; after images began circulating of street art using the name. These images were collected on an Instagram account and later uploads noted the date of September 9 and time of 9 P.M. Arcade Fire confirmed their connection to the campaign with a billboard put up in New York City on August 26, 2013. A week later, the band released a 15-second music clip on Spotify titled &quot;9pm 9/9&quot; under the album name &quot;Reflektor&quot;.
English rock musician David Bowie contributed to backing vocals on the title song, &quot;Reflektor&quot; after praising the song&#x27;s quality in fall 2013. In September 2013, Arcade Fire released a version of the 1980 hit single &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; for the Peter Gabriel tribute album &quot;And I&#x27;ll Scratch Yours&quot;. Upon its release, &quot;Reflektor&quot; received positive reviews from music critics and had a successful commercial performance. The album was recognized as one of The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far, a list published by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in August 2014.

Arcade Fire were the musical guest on the 39th-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on September 28, 2013. The episode drew six million viewers. They also appeared in a half hour special on NBC, &quot;Arcade Fire in Here Comes the Night Time&quot;, that aired immediately after &quot;SNL&quot;. The special featured cameo appearances by Ben Stiller, Bono, Bill Hader, Zach Galifianakis, Rainn Wilson, Aziz Ansari, Eric Wareheim, and Michael Cera. The concert footage was filmed at the band&#x27;s surprise September 9 appearance at Montreal&#x27;s Club Salsathèque. Arcade Fire performed live at the YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. The performance featured an experimental &quot;live video&quot; directed by &quot;Her&quot; writer and director Spike Jonze, and actress Greta Gerwig. The band was nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Her&quot;. They were also nominated for a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Music Score. The band headlined the 2014 Glastonbury Festival on June 27.

At the 2014 Juno Awards, &quot;Reflektor&quot; won Album of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year. The album was also a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. In 2015, Arcade Fire was the recipient of the International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards held in Montreal.

A documentary film about the making of the album, called &quot;The Reflektor Tapes&quot;, was released on September 24, 2015, and was shown at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival. The following day, a deluxe edition of the album containing original recordings and five unreleased songs was released. The documentary was directed by Kahlil Joseph, winner of the 2013 Sundance Grand Jury Prize for Short Films.

===2016–2019: &quot;Everything Now&quot;===
On May 25, 2016, Win Butler and Régine Chassagne performed a surprise set outside the Louvre which included a new song. The pair were invited by the French street artist JR to DJ at the launch of his new exhibition titled &quot;JR Au Louvre&quot;, but the two decided to set up drums and keyboards in the Tuileries gardens.

On June 17, Will Butler hosted a Reddit AMA, where he answered fan questions about the next Arcade Fire album. He stated that the new record might be released in spring 2017 and that the band had &#x27;no definite schedule though. It&#x27;ll be done when it&#x27;s done.&#x27; On July 5, the band played their first complete full-band concert in two years in Barcelona, Spain as a warm up for their upcoming summer festival dates in Canada, Portugal, Spain and USA. On July 19, Tim Kingsbury told CBC that the band&#x27;s upcoming fifth album would be out in 2017. On January 19, 2017, the band released a new single to coincide with Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration entitled &quot;I Give You Power&quot;. The song featured guest vocals from singer Mavis Staples. The proceeds were donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.
Arcade Fire signed a two album recording contract with Columbia Records in May 2017. On May 31, the band released a new single &quot;Everything Now&quot; on a limited edition 12&quot; vinyl at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona. Arcade Fire would also perform at the festival in early June 2017. A day later, Arcade Fire announced their fifth studio album &quot;Everything Now&quot;, which was released on July 28, 2017, and released a music video for &quot;Everything Now&quot;. In July 2017, &quot;Everything Now&quot; became Arcade Fire&#x27;s first single to reach number one on a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, reaching number one on the Adult Alternative Songs airplay chart. In October 2017, long-time manager Scott Rodger parted ways with the band.

After releasing two teasers on their social media pages a few days before, on March 12, 2018, the band announced a short film, directed by David Wilson called &quot;Money + Love&quot;, containing two of their songs &quot;Put Your Money On Me&quot; and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Deserve Love&quot;, and being released on March 15. On March 17, Arcade Fire were featured as the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for a fifth time, performing &quot;Creature Comfort&quot; and &quot;Put Your Money On Me&quot;. For the 2019 Disney film, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, Arcade Fire performs an end-credits version of &quot;Baby Mine&quot;, by Frank Churchill and Ned Washington, which was released as a single on March 11, 2019.

===2020–present: &quot;We&quot; ===

On October 21, 2020, Butler was interviewed for the Broken Record podcast, where he commented about Arcade Fire&#x27;s sixth album. The band had been writing for a year before the COVID-19 lockdown. During lockdown, Butler kept working and wrote &quot;two or three albums&quot;. In April 2020, Butler shared some snippets of new material in the social networks. On April 14, 2021, the band released a 45-minute instrumental piece, entitled “Memories of the Age of Anxiety” on the meditation application Headspace.

In March 2022, fans received postcards marked with the band&#x27;s logo; the postcards included the note &quot;We missed you&quot;, musical notations, as well as an image of an eye with the word &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; written below. Those same images began to appear in signage around London as well as on the band&#x27;s social media pages, indicating the earliest signs of a new album. On March 14, the band announced a new song titled &quot;The Lightning I, II&quot; would be released on March 17. That same day, the band played a concert benefiting the Plus 1 Ukraine relief fund at the Toulouse Theatre in New Orleans, marking their first full-band performance in over two years. They also performed at Bowery Ballroom in New York City on March 18 and 19, benefitting the same organization. Tickets for all three shows were sold on a &quot;pay what you can&quot; basis.

On March 17, 2022, Arcade Fire announced that the album would be titled &quot;We&quot; and be released on May 6, 2022. Later that week, Will Butler announced he had amicably left the band in 2021 shortly after the completion of &quot;We&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;We&quot; on May 6, 2022, Arcade Fire announced the &quot;WE&quot; Tour, the group&#x27;s first world tour since 2018, starting in August 2022. They again appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 7, 2022, playing &quot;Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)&quot;, &quot;The Lightning I, II&quot;, and &quot;End of The Empire II&quot; over the closing credits. They ended the Mother&#x27;s Day performance with Win Butler stating “A woman’s right to choose forever and ever and ever, amen.”

On August 27, 2022, Win Butler was accused by four people of several instances of sexual misconduct between 2016 and 2020, including sexual assault, unwanted explicit texts, and pursuing relationships with younger fans ranging in age from 18 to 23. Butler and Chassagne denied the allegations and said all the encounters had been consensual. A few days later, Canadian artist Feist announced that she and her band would be dropping out as the opening act of the European leg of the &quot;WE&quot; Tour due to the allegations, having donated proceeds from the two shows she had already played to a local women&#x27;s aid organization in Dublin. Beck also dropped out as the opening act of the tour&#x27;s American leg later that year.

In November 2022, Arcade Fire were announced as headliners for the 2023 editions of the Kalorama festival in Lisbon and the Cala Mijas festival in Málaga. In April 2023, Arcade Fire were added to Pharrell Williams&#x27; curated festival Something in the Water, held in Virginia Beach. In June 2023, Arcade Fire was announced as a Friday headliner for Mexico City&#x27;s Corona Capital festival in November. Arcade Fire earned headlining slots on 2024 festivals, including all South American Lollapalooza editions, Shaky Knees in Atlanta and Bilbao BBK Live in Bilbao, Spain.

== Activism ==
=== Haiti ===
Because Régine Chassagne is of Haitian descent, Arcade Fire continuously works to support Haitian people through raising awareness of the struggles this country currently faces, as well as the history, specifically the regime of François Duvalier in which 30,000 to 60,000 Haitians were murdered. This time in history is highlighted in Arcade Fire&#x27;s song &quot;Haiti&quot;.
* 2004: Arcade Fire played two shows in the hometown of Haiti where all profits were donated to Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s hospital in Haiti.
* 2005–present: Arcade Fire has donated $1.00, £1.00, or €1.00 of every ticket sold on tour to Partners in Health + Kanpe, via Plus1.
* 2006: Proceeds from the release of track &quot;Intervention&quot; were dedicated to Partners in Health.
* 2009: Arcade Fire recorded &quot;Lenin&quot; for Red Hot Organization&#x27;s &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;. $850,000 raised for AIDS relief; $300,000 was donated to Partners in Health.
* 2010: The NFL purchased rights to &quot;Wake Up&quot; for Super Bowl XLIV; all proceeds went to Partners in Health.
* AF ♥ Haiti campaign: trained 50k+ volunteers to engage fans in Partners in Health&#x27;s mission.

<text>USS &quot;Raleigh&quot; (CL-7) was the fourth light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, built for the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship named for the city of Raleigh, North Carolina, the first being the protected cruiser , commissioned in 1894, and decommissioned in 1919.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; spent most of her pre-war career in the Atlantic. Her first duty was to assist in the USAAS&#x27;s first aerial circumnavigation of the world in 1924. In 1936, &quot;Raleigh&quot; joined Squadron 40-T in neutrality patrols during the Spanish Civil War where she would serve until 1938, when she would be transferred to the Pacific. This led her to be fatefully moored in Pearl Harbor at berth F-12 on the morning of 7 December 1941, where she took a torpedo in her No.2 boiler room and claimed five victories with her anti-aircraft batteries with no loss of life.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Raleigh&quot; was ordered on 29 August 1916, and contracted to be built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts, 21 August 1917. Her keel was laid on 16 August 1920, and launched on 25 October 1922, the cruiser was christened by Miss Jennie Proctor; and commissioned 6 February 1924, with Captain William C. Watts in command.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; was powered by four Curtis steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 

&quot;Raleigh&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to be mounted by ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After the United States entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-inch/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. &quot;Raleigh&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by three inches of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The conning tower and the deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had one and a half inches of armor. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were Vought VE-9s, then Vought UO-1s, the ship then operated Curtiss SOC Seagulls from 1935, and Vought OS2U Kingfishers after 1940.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Raleigh&quot; went through several armament changes. Some of these changes were to reduce weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. On 8 September 1926, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Edward W. Eberle, along with the Commanders in Chief of the United States Fleet and Battle Fleet, and their subordinate commanding officers, the Secretary of the Navy, Curtis D. Wilbur, ordered that all mines and the tracks for laying the mines be removed from all of the &quot;Omaha&quot;-class cruisers, the working conditions had been found to be very &quot;wet&quot;. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940 the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with eight Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Raleigh&quot; shifted from Quincy to the New York Navy Yard on 26 February 1924, to finish her fitting out. She left on 16 April, for her shakedown cruise off of the Virginia Capes. She finished her final building yard alterations at Quincy, on 24 June. &quot;Raleigh&quot; then transferred to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she stayed until 30 July, when she joined the Light Cruiser Division, Scouting Fleet, in northern European waters for duty in connection with the United States Army Air Service&#x27;s &quot;World Flight&quot;. After calling at ports in Norway, Denmark, and Scotland, she took up her reconnaissance station on 31 July, off Hvalfjörður, Iceland. On 10 August, she shifted her station to the east coast of Greenland. Upon completion of her duty with the flight operations, on 3 September, she set sail for the Boston Navy Yard, for voyage repairs.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; set out from Boston Harbor, on 16 October 1924, for maneuvers again off of the Virginia Capes. This was followed by operations and battle problems off Panama, California, and the Hawaiian Islands. Steaming from Honolulu, on 10 June 1925, she docked at San Diego, with the Scouting Fleet, before her return to the Boston Navy Yard, on 13 July. &quot;Raleigh&quot; would continue to operate out of Boston, for the next two years, spending most of the winter months with the Scouting Force in Cuban and Panamanian waters.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; sailed from Boston Harbor, on 1 February 1927. She embarked two detachments of Marines at Charleston, South Carolina. After first participating in maneuvers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, she transited the Panama Canal for Corinto, Nicaragua. &quot;Raleigh&quot; arrived on 5 February, and on 19 February, along with her sister ship , landed the Marines, who were needed to deal with the bandit-plagued countryside. The cruiser stood by for possible assistance until 23 March, when she returned to Boston, and resumed Atlantic coastal operations.

During the spring of 1928, &quot;Raleigh&quot; operated off the California coast and in Hawaiian waters, returning to Boston on 26 June to prepare for European duty. Departing on 17 August, she steamed for Hampton Roads, Va., where, on 15 September, she relieved as flagship of Vice Admiral John H. Dayton, commander, Naval Forces, Europe.

After touching at Boston, &quot;Raleigh&quot; made diplomatic calls to many principal European ports before returning to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 4 September 1929. The next day, she hauled down the flag of Vice Admiral Dayton.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; then rejoined Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3) of the Scouting Force, operating for the next few years out of Boston for battle practice, maneuvers, and port calls. Based at San Diego, California, on 15 August 1933, she trained off the California coast, with occasional runs to the Caribbean, as well as to Alaskan and Hawaiian waters. She departed San Diego on 27 April 1936 in company with the US Fleet, transited the Panama Canal, touched at Charleston, South Carolina, and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard on 15 June for overhaul.

As &quot;Raleigh&quot; repaired in the Norfolk Navy Yard, Squadron 40-T, a special temporary squadron, was organized for duty in Spanish waters to evacuate American nationals from the Spanish Civil War areas. Rear Admiral Arthur P. Fairfield broke his flag in &quot;Raleigh&quot; at Norfolk on 17 September 1936. The next day, the cruiser steamed independently for Gibraltar, arriving on 27 September. , and , in company with &quot;Raleigh&quot;, initially comprised the squadron. Together, the ships saved hundreds of Americans and other nationals from the dangers of the war in Spain.

 relieved &quot;Raleigh&quot; at Villefranche on 28 April 1938, and two days later, &quot;Raleigh&quot; headed for Hampton Roads for overhaul in the Norfolk Navy Yard, arriving on 13 May.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; was next assigned to Flotilla One, Destroyer Squadron, US Battle Force. Clearing Norfolk on 16 August, she trained at Guantanamo Bay and then arrived at her new base of San Diego on 5 September. In early 1939, she participated in the fleet problem in the Caribbean, returning to San Diego in May to resume coastal operations. Next assigned to the Hawaiian Detachment, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed for Pearl Harbor on 5 October. As the flagship of Destroyer Flotilla One, she engaged in fleet maneuvers which took her from the central Pacific to the California coast.

===World War II===

&quot;Raleigh&quot; was moored at berth F-12, on the east side of the north channel at Pearl Harbor, when the Japanese made their surprise attack. In the first attack wave a torpedo passed ahead and a second hit &quot;Raleigh&quot; portside amidships. The cruiser took such a list to port that it appeared she might capsize. As crew jettisoned topside weight to keep her upright, her gunners helped to destroy five Japanese planes. Several of her crew were wounded, but none were killed.

The next day, yard craft and came alongside to render assistance, and &quot;Raleigh&quot; was towed into the Navy Yard for repairs on 22 December. She departed Pearl Harbor on 21 February 1942 as an escort of a five-ship convoy which arrived in San Francisco on 1 March. After overhaul at Mare Island, she cleared San Francisco Bay on 23 July as a unit of Task Force 15 (TF 15) assigned to convoy escort duty between San Francisco, Hawaii, Samoa and the Fiji Islands.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed from Pago Pago on 3 November to search out and destroy four Japanese picket ships reportedly operating between the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Finding no trace of the enemy, she touched at Pearl Harbor from 13 to 17 November, then steamed independently to Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, Aleutians, arriving on 24 November. The following months were spent searching for enemy ships carrying reinforcements in the Rat and Near Islands and escorting troop and supply ships between Dutch Harbor and Kulak Bay.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; put to sea on 10 January 1943, with Task Group 8.6 (TG 8.6) to cover the occupation of Amchitka Island. On 12 January, she conducted patrols off Amchitka, with infrequent sweeps off Kiska with her task group. Detached from the group on 10 February, she convoyed ships between Dutch Harbor and Kulak Bay, then entered Puget Sound Navy Yard on 23 March for repairs.

Sailing on 22 April, she arrived Adak on the 28th and joined TG 16.6, patrolling the approaches to the Near Islands and covering the southern approach to Kiska. &quot;Raleigh&quot; participated in the bombardment of Kiska on 2 August, blasting targets in Gertrude Cove, and shelled enemy positions again on 12 August, before heading for San Francisco and overhaul.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; stood out of San Francisco Bay on 15 September and resumed support of operations in the Aleutians, sweeping the ocean from Kiska to west of Attu. As part of TG 94.6, she steamed from Massacre Bay, Attu on 1 February 1944 to bombard enemy installations in Kurabu Zaki, Paramushiru in the Northern Kuriles. In the early morning darkness of 4 February, she took her bombardment station off that enemy shore to blast an area where two dual-purpose batteries were located. She also took an airfield under fire, destroying a hangar and several barracks buildings. Her gunners also scored hits on a small merchant ship anchored inshore. After touching at Attu on 5 February, &quot;Raleigh&quot; returned to Puget Sound Navy Yard on 1 March for a three-month overhaul.

Joining TF 94 at Massacre Bay in the Aleutian Islands on 6 June, she suffered a casualty to her number two main engine while &quot;en route&quot; to Matsuwa Island. After repairs at Puget Sound, &quot;Raleigh&quot; departed Seattle on 22 June 1945, touched at San Pedro, California, thence proceeded via the Panama Canal to Hampton Roads and then to her new home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Calling at Annapolis, Maryland, on 1 July 1945, she conducted two midshipman training cruises, in the Caribbean and along the east coast.

==Fate==
&quot;Raleigh&quot; entered to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 September 1945, was decommissioned there on 2 November, and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November. Her hulk was sold for scrap at Philadelphia on 27 February 1946.
