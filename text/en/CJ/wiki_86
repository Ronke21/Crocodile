<text>Ivor John Allchurch (16 October 1929 – 10 July 1997) was a Welsh professional footballer who played as an inside forward.

Known as the &quot;Golden Boy of Welsh football&quot;, Allchurch began his career playing for his hometown side Swansea Town, where he spent over 10 years, captaining the side for several seasons and scoring over 100 goals in all competitions. He attracted attention from numerous clubs during his early years with Swansea, but chose to remain with the club until the age of 28, when he joined First Division side Newcastle United. Signing in 1958 for a fee of £28,000, he formed a prolific strike partnership with George Eastham and Len White. In 1962, he joined Cardiff City for £18,000, where he spent three seasons, before finishing his professional career with a second spell with Swansea Town. His two spells with Swansea saw him become the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer.

During his career, Allchurch won a total of 68 caps for Wales, a record which stood until 1986 when it was exceeded by Joey Jones. He also jointly held the record number of goals scored for Wales, along with Trevor Ford, 23, which was eventually broken by Ian Rush. His talents were more widely recognised after his performance for Wales during the 1958 FIFA World Cup, in which he scored twice and helped them to reach the quarter-finals. His brother Len was also a footballer and the pair played alongside each other for Wales on several occasions.

==Early life==
Ivor John Allchurch was born on Waun-wen Road in Swansea on 16 October 1929. His parents, Charles Wilfried Allchurch and Mabel Sarah Allchurch (née Miller), were originally from Dudley in Worcestershire but had moved to South Wales during the Post–World War I recession in search of work, following Mabel&#x27;s parents to the area and settling in the Castle area of the town. His father had worked as a banksman in Dudley but found employment in Swansea as a furnace man.

Allchurch was the sixth of seven children, with two sisters and four brothers, who grew up in a three bedroomed house on Landeg Street in Plasmarl. Including his parents and his siblings, the house was home to eleven people, including his step brother Willie and his niece Christine who was raised by Allchurch&#x27;s mother. As a child, he attended Plasmarl School, leaving at the age of 14 to find work. After leaving, Allchurch worked in an office at Baldwin&#x27;s Foundry, a company that manufactured bomb casings, but grew frustrated in the role and quickly looked to move on. He instead took up work as a porter in a local fish market, after noticing that the younger boys working there were frequently allowed early finishes during winter time due to a lack of stock in wartime which allowed them to play football on a regular basis. The job also allowed him to supplement his income as each worker was allowed to take any remaining stock to sell of their own accord once a week, a task that Allchurch would undertake with his brother Len.

Allchurch&#x27;s brothers were also keen footballers, Charlie and Arthur both played football in local leagues, Arthur represented Wales at amateur level and Len played professionally for Swansea Town, Sheffield United and Stockport County as well as representing Wales.

==Playing career==
===Youth and wartime===
Allchurch was playing local youth football at under-18 Cwm Level Park when he was spotted by Joe Sykes, a scout who worked for Swansea Town under the management of Haydn Green. Following a match, Sykes approached Allchurch, who was only 14 at the time, and asked for his name and address, visiting the family home soon after where he reached an agreement with Allchurch&#x27;s father that he would join the club when he turned 15 as an amateur and train two days a week. During his time as an amateur at the club, Allchurch was approached on two occasions by scouts from Football League sides to sign for different clubs but turned the moves down as he did not want to break the verbal agreement that he and his father had made to sign for the &quot;Swans&quot;.

In 1948, when he turned 18, Allchurch was called up to start his National Service and enlisted as a gunner in the British Army. Stationed in Oswestry, he continued to play football for the representative sides of his unit and Western Command. His performances for the teams in November 1948 attracted the attention of Shrewsbury Town manager Leslie Knighton who signed Allchurch to represent the side in the Midland Football League during his military service, describing him as &quot;a future star&quot;. He made his debut at Gay Meadow in the same month and remained with the club for the rest of the 1948–49 season. During his time at the club, Knighton turned down numerous offers from Football League sides for Allchurch, as he was still registered to play for Swansea Town, and described him as a &quot;second Charlie Buchan.&quot; At the start of the following season, Allchurch also played for Wellington Town before he was demobilised from his military service, allowing him to return to Swansea.

===Swansea Town===
He returned to Swansea in 1949, where manager Billy McCandless had already received offers for Allchurch even though he had not made his professional debut. Despite the interest, Allchurch joined a side that had won promotion comfortably from the Football League Third Division South the previous year and the favoured attacking partnership of Sammy McCrory and Billy Lucas meant that Allchurch continued to play for the club&#x27;s reserve side in The Football Combination. He eventually received his first call up to the first team on Boxing Day 1949 at the age of 20, making his debut in a 3–0 defeat to West Ham United. Although the &quot;Swans&quot; lost, Allchurch impressed enough to be handed a second start on 7 January 1950, scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 3–0 victory over First Division side Birmingham City in the third round of the FA Cup. In the next round, Swansea suffered a 2–1 defeat to eventual winners Arsenal but Allchurch again made headlines for his performance with Arsenal player Joe Mercer later commenting that he &quot;nearly frightened us to death&quot; as McCandless and the Swansea board were again forced to fend off offers from several clubs. He also claimed a Welsh Cup winners&#x27; medal at the end of the 1949–50 season, playing in a 4–1 victory over Wrexham in the final on 27 April 1950.

During this period, Swansea suffered from financial difficulties which saw the sale of several first team players such as McCrory, Jim Feeney and Roy Paul. This allowed Allchurch and a number of other youth players, including Terry Medwin and John King to establish themselves in the squad, Allchurch becoming the youngest player in the club&#x27;s history to be ever present during an entire season, having played in every league game for the club, during the 1950–51 season. Further approaches from Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City were also rejected by the &quot;Swans&quot;. However, the side struggled to perform in the Second Division, finishing in 18th and 19th positions between 1950 and 1952, and Allchurch contemplated a move away from Vetch Field after being encouraged by some teammates at international level to move to a First Division side.

Allchurch was persuaded to remain at the club, encouraged by Sykes and McCandless&#x27; belief in a number of local youth players making their way through the &quot;Swans&quot; setup, including Cliff Jones, Harry Griffiths and Allchurch&#x27;s brother Len. In September 1952, Swansea rejected a bid of £30,000 from Arsenal for Allchurch, the bid just £5,000 below the British record transfer fee that Sheffield Wednesday had paid for Jackie Sewell a year previously. He finished the 1952–53 season as the club&#x27;s second highest top scorer with 15 goals, including his first career hattrick during a 3–2 victory over Brentford on 6 April 1953. The Swans attacking trio of Allchurch, Medwin and Griffiths accounted for more than half of the club&#x27;s league goals during the season.

In 1955, the club was rocked by the sudden death of manager McCandless, days after the players had returned to pre-season training. The Swansea board decided against appointing a permanent replacement, instead establishing a three-man selection committee consisting of Allchurch, Ron Burgess and Joe Sykes, with Burgess being given the title of &quot;team manager&quot;. Under the guidance of the trio, the &quot;Swans&quot; were able to mount a serious promotion challenge, going unbeaten in eleven games between September and December 1955. However, following a serious injury to defender Tom Kiley, the committee fell out with the Swansea board over their refusal to provide funds to secure a replacement for Kiley, Burgess having transfers for Bob McKinlay and Jimmy Dugdale rejected by the board. The loss of Kiley and the conflict with the board saw Swansea lose 7 of their last 8 matches of the season, eventually finishing in 10th position. His growing frustration at the club&#x27;s refusal to invest in the squad and a strained relationship with new manager Trevor Morris led Allchurch to announce his decision to leave the club, stating in his own newspaper column &quot;I am ready to admit that I had high hopes that my own club would get promotion a couple of years ago [...] then I would have been happy to end my career in the town [...] But that dream does not look like coming true&quot;. Morris later used the money from Allchurch&#x27;s transfer to sign Colin Webster and Reg Davies.

===Newcastle United===
====First Division====

Allchurch&#x27;s decision to leave the &quot;Swans&quot; saw a large amount of interest, with Liverpool offering to fly a private plane to South Wales and meet any valuation Swansea placed on him. Liverpool chairman Tom Williams and manager Phil Taylor also travelled to meet Allchurch, but were rejected as he wished to move to a team in the First Division. Aston Villa had an offer accepted, but Newcastle United chairman Alderman McKeag quickly offered an increased amount of £28,000. On 10 October 1958, Allchurch travelled to Manchester to meet Newcastle manager Charlie Mitten, where he was convinced to join Newcastle, signing his contract on a luggage trolley at Manchester Exchange railway station. Despite having never met his new teammates, he made his debut for the club, his first match in the First Division, the following day against Leicester City, scoring twice during a 3–1 victory. He joined the club&#x27;s established strike partnership of George Eastham and Len White, the trio going on to score 48 of the club&#x27;s 81 goals during the course of the 1958–59 season with Allchurch finishing as the club&#x27;s second top scorer behind White despite missing more than a quarter of the season.

Despite early season optimism, Newcastle began the 1959–60 campaign in poor form, suffering a 5–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the season and found themselves in 18th place by October having lost 8 of their first 15 matches. With the club struggling, the board denied Allchurch permission to be released to play a fixture for Wales in order to focus on the club&#x27;s fortunes, which saw an aggrieved Allchurch hand in a transfer request as he believed the club had &quot;broken their word&quot; after a verbal agreement between himself and Mitten that he would be released for any international fixtures. After a number of changes by Mitten, Newcastle were able to return to form and his transfer request was eventually dropped as the &quot;Magpies&quot; finished the season in 8th position, Allchurch again reaching double figure league goals during the season for the second consecutive year in the First Division.

====Decline====

The following season saw a tumultuous period for the club with Eastham submitting a transfer request and refusing to return to training after the club rejected his request. Allchurch himself submitted another rejected transfer request, this time due to his wish to return to South Wales in order for his wife Esme to be near her family during a new pregnancy following the loss of a child during her previous pregnancy. The club again started poorly and Mitten switched Allchurch from his usual inside-forward role to the number nine position in order to be used as the club&#x27;s main striker in an attempt to improve results but Allchurch grew frustrated with the decision, backing Len White as the club&#x27;s best centre-forward and even refusing to play on three occasions over the decision. Mitten eventually backed down and, following reassurance over his wife&#x27;s condition, Allchurch withdrew his transfer request. Later in the season, following an injury to captain Jimmy Scoular, Allchurch was elected as the stand in captain by the squad. Teammate Bob Stokoe commented that &quot;there&#x27;s no one better equipped for the job&quot;. However, Newcastle were unable to turn their season around and suffered relegation to the Second Division in May 1961.

Relegation further fueled talk of Allchurch leaving Newcastle. Manager Mitten appointed Allchurch as permanent team captain for the start of their season, having commented that he had been impressed by his dedication, and stated in a newspaper interview &quot;With the maximum wage restriction removed we can afford to pay Allchurch in relation to his value to United, which is tremendous! Tell me where and at what cost can we replace him?&quot; The abolition of the maximum wage cap had seen Allchurch&#x27;s wages rise to £60 per week. During the season, Allchurch was one of just two players who appeared in more than 30 matches, along with Dick Keith, as the club rotated players in an attempt to find form. He later resigned from his position as captain after the Newcastle board again attempted to block his call up to the Welsh national side. The death of a prematurely born daughter affected Allchurch&#x27;s form as he looked after his children during his wife&#x27;s recovery and the personal difficulty during this period convinced Allchurch to announce his intention to leave the club and move closer to his wider family.

===Cardiff City===

In August 1962, he joined Cardiff City, who had been relegated from the First Division the previous season, for a fee of £18,000. The club board had drawn criticism from fans for signing older Welsh players who were seen as &quot;faded stars&quot;, such as Trevor Ford and Mel Charles, in previous seasons but pushed forward to complete the signing of then 32-year old Allchurch. Taking a £20 per week pay cut to join the &quot;Bluebirds&quot;, Allchurch made his debut on the opening day of the 1962–63 season, captaining the side and scoring in a 4–4 draw with his former club Newcastle United. In the following weeks, local newspapers attributed the club&#x27;s positive start to the season to Allchurch&#x27;s leadership, with the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; claiming that he was &quot;one of the best skippers the club has ever had&quot;. But despite this and a prolific forward partnership formed between Allchurch and Peter Hooper, who scored 34 league goals between them, the club eventually faded into a mid-table place, finishing in tenth position.

Prior to the start of the 1963–64 season, the club saw the departures of several key players, including Hooper and Alan Durban. The signing of fellow Welsh international John Charles had raised hopes of improvement but the side struggled throughout the season, winning just 14 league matches out of 42. Allchurch finished as the club&#x27;s top league scorer, scoring 12 times including a hat-trick against Sunderland in September 1963. The club&#x27;s struggles saw George Swindin dismissed as manager and replaced by Jimmy Scoular, who had captained Newcastle during Allchurch&#x27;s spell in the North-East. Allchurch found Scoular&#x27;s loud and vocal form of management difficult and in mid-October 1964, found himself dropped from the side after recovering from a brief thigh injury as Scoular favoured playing Peter King in his place. He did not return to the first team until February, during which time he stated his desire to leave the club, when Scoular was forced to recall him after the &quot;Bluebirds&quot; had suffered a severe decline during his absence. Scoular had introduced a new youth policy within the squad, handing regular places to players such as King, George Johnston and Don Murray. Murray later commented that he regarded it as a privilege to play alongside Allchurch and Charles and stated &quot;There was a saying among the players, if you are in trouble give it to Ivor&quot;.

He scored nine times following his return to the first team, including a hat-trick against his former side Swansea which condemned them to relegation into the Third Division, to finish as the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for the second consecutive season. He also made his debut in European competition, as Cardiff qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup having won the Welsh Cup the previous year, playing in a 0–0 draw with Danish side Esbjerg fB in the first round. He played his final match for the club on 24 April 1965, scoring Cardiff&#x27;s first goal during a 3–1 victory over Rotherham United.

===Later career===

At the age of 35, Allchurch returned to his hometown club Swansea Town in 1965, after they agreed a fee of £8000 with Cardiff to complete the transfer. His return to Vetch Field saw a significant increase in the sale of season tickets and Allchurch was greeted by a large &quot;welcome home Ivor&quot; banner in his first game on his return. However, early season form was poor as the side struggled to adapt to a new &quot;modern&quot; gameplan adopted by manager Glyn Davies, losing 3 of their first 4 matches. Allchurch handed the club their first win of the season, scoring the only goal of the game during a 1–0 victory over Grimsby Town but, by October, the club were struggling at the foot of the table. In December 1965, First Division side Northampton Town offered £11,000 to sign Allchurch but he himself rejected the offer saying it was &quot;flattering&quot; but that he was &quot;happy to be back with Swansea&quot;. The following month, in the New Years honours list in 1966, Allchurch was awarded an MBE for his services to sport. The club finished the season in the bottom half of the table but did win the Welsh Cup, defeating Chester City in the final with Allchurch scoring the winning goal.

Swansea&#x27;s troubles continued the following season, amassing just six points during the first third of the season and suffering a 5–1 aggregate defeat against Bulgarian side Slavia Sofia in the opening round of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, with the club board accusing some players of a &quot;lack of effort&quot;. Davies&#x27; contract as manager was cancelled by mutual consent and long serving club trainer Joe Sykes was temporarily appointed manager with Allchurch part of his selection committee. Sykes also handed the club captaincy to Allchurch, replacing Brian Purcell, but the club eventually suffered relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1966–67 season. He remained with the club, entering the final year of his contract, but was switched to playing as a striker by manager Billy Lucas in order to lessen the amount of running required of Allchurch who had turned 38 during the opening months of the season. The change of position benefited him, scoring seventeen times in the league in forty matches. Approaching the end of the season, he was offered a one-year extension to his contract with the club, with a £5 per week pay cut, but eventually decided to retire from professional football, making his final appearance on 6 May 1968 against Hartlepools United. He retired from professional football as Swansea&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer. He later spent time playing non-league football with Worcester City and had a spell as player-manager of Haverfordwest County before ending his career at Pontardawe Athletic at the age of 50.

==International career==
Allchurch was called up to the Wales senior squad for the first time at the age of 21, having made just 30 senior league appearances for Swansea, making his international debut in a 4–2 defeat to England on 15 November 1950 at Roker Park in the 1950–51 British Home Championship. He would remain a regular fixture in the Wales side, making a further 26 consecutive appearances for his country after his debut over the following six years, and was part of the squad that qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup by defeating Israel in a play-off match, scoring in both legs of the tie.

He was chosen in the squad for the finals in Sweden and scored seven times in a 19–0 victory over a local amateur side during a warm-up match. He played in all three of Wales&#x27; group matches, scoring in a 1–1 draw with Mexico, and scored their first goal in a 2–1 victory over Hungary in a play-off match to reach the quarter-finals. They lost 1–0 to eventual winners Brazil in the quarter-finals following a goal from Pelé. Following the tournament, Wales international Dave Bowen commented that they had &quot;surprised a lot of people&quot; with their performance and also praised Allchurch, stating &quot;they looked at Ivor and wondered where he had been hiding. He could have played for any of the teams out there, including Brazil&quot;.

In 1962, he won his 50th international cap in a match against Scotland, becoming Wales&#x27; most capped player of all-time having overtaken the previous record holder Billy Meredith. He played his final game for his country against Chile in 1966. In all, Allchurch played 68 times for Wales, scoring 23 goals. His caps record stood for nearly twenty years until it was beaten by Joey Jones and his 23 goals tied Trevor Ford as Wales&#x27; highest scoring player until Ian Rush later overtook the pair.

==Personal life==

Following his return from national service, Allchurch became engaged to Esme Thomas who was 16 at the time, the couple keeping their engagement secret from their parents until she turned 18. The pair publicly revealed their engagement when she turned 18 and eventually married in 1953, settling in the Mumbles district of Swansea. The couple had two sons, John and David. Following Allchurch&#x27;s transfer to Newcastle in 1958, the family relocated to Kenton, Newcastle upon Tyne.

He was named BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year in 1962 and, in 1966, he was awarded a Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in recognition of his services to Welsh football. He is also a member of the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame and the English Football Hall of Fame having been inducted in 1995 and 2005 respectively. Allchurch and his wife moved to a bungalow in Bishopston, Swansea after his retirement from professional football and he worked as a storeman for a stationery company. He died on 10 July 1997 at his home aged 67. His funeral was held at Swansea Crematorium and attracted over 500 people.

To celebrate Allchurch&#x27;s achievements for his local club, it was originally decided that money should be raised for a bust of him, which was raised by Swansea City supporters. However, the strong support eventually saw the plans changed to incorporate a statute outside their stadium. In 2005, a life-sized statue of Allchurch was unveiled outside Swansea&#x27;s newly opened Liberty Stadium.

<text>Friedrich Simon Archenhold (2 October 1861 in Lichtenau, Kingdom of Prussia – 14 October 1939 in Berlin) was an astronomer who founded the Treptow Observatory (today the Archenhold Observatory) in Berlin-Treptow. He graduated from the Realgymnasium in Lippstadt before entering Friedrich Wilhelm University in 1882, where he and Wilhelm Förster founded the Urania Society at the Berlin University Observatory.

==Largest telescope==
On the basis of Archenhold&#x27;s plans, the world&#x27;s longest moving refracting telescope was built with a focal length of 21 meters. The telescope was part of the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin, a world&#x27;s fair. The giant telescope was constructed in Treptow, a suburb of Berlin. The telescope was opened to the public on 1 May 1896 in a temporary wooden structure which was completed in September. 

== Public observatory ==

By 1908 Archenhold had raised the funds to replace the wooden structure with the building that stands today. Some of the funds came from admission fees to lectures but he also was able to secure funds from the Scottish American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.

Archenhold was able to attract numerous well-known scientists and researchers for guest lectures at the Observatory. Perhaps the most famous was Albert Einstein who gave his first public lecture on the theory of relativity on 2 June 1915. 

Like Wilhelm Foerster, Archenhold was interested in making scientific knowledge accessible to lay audiences. In addition to his support for the Urania Society, he was a member of various middle-class associations devoted to popularizing science. 

During 1920 Dr. Archenhold bought a fisherman&#x27;s house with adobe walls and wooden cladding in the Baltic village of Bansin. When the long summer nights reduced his observation time F. S. Archenhold would take his family to his summer house in Bansin. Here he worked on the magazines and papers that he published at the observatory.

== History of the family ==

By 1938 the Nazi party confiscated the home from the family. His widow Alice Archenhold and daughter Hilde died at Theresienstadt.

When the Russians defeated the Nazis the property was used by the community. The Observatory was named after Archenhold in 1946 as the (Archenhold Observatory). 

The Archenhold family had no right to recover any of the 125 acres of land or house until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. His summer house on Seestraße, 63 is still standing, but it is in very poor condition. The old house in Bansin is now owned by his granddaughter.

After the reunification of Germany, the Archenhold Observatory became part of the Deutsches Technikmuseum.

Archenhold is buried in Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

<text>The Crypt School is a grammar school with academy status for boys and girls located in the city of Gloucester. Founded in the 16th century, it was originally an all-boys school, but it made its sixth form co-educational in the 1980s and moved to a mixed intake from year 7 in 2018, thereby becoming the only fully coeducational selective school in Gloucester. The school was founded in 1539 by Joan Cooke with money inherited from her husband John.

==History==
===Founders===

John Cooke (d. 1528) was a wealthy brewer and mercer of Gloucester, one of the city&#x27;s earliest aldermen, serving as sheriff in 1494 and 1498. He held the office of mayor four times, in 1501, 1507, 1512 and 1518. He was a significant benefactor in the city during his life, but it was his will that started the process for the establishment of a grammar school in Gloucester. The scheme was given effect by his wife Joan Cooke, who survived him by 17 years, dying in 1545. It was Joan therefore who created the tripartite deed of 1539, deemed to be the founding charter. The school remains today the most ancient in Gloucester. A full account of the couple and their good works is described in the book by Roland Austin published in 1939 &quot;Crypt School&quot;. A portrait of the pair painted some years after Joan&#x27;s death is extant. It shows John in his mayoral robe, shaking hands with Joan and it is in the collection of Gloucester City Council.

=== Site ===
In the school&#x27;s 500-year history it has been sited in three different locations within the city of Gloucester. The original school was part of St Mary de Crypt Church in Southgate Street and the schoolroom can still be seen there. Later, in 1889, the school moved to Greyfriars, known better as Friar&#x27;s Orchard, and in 1943, to its present site at Podsmead. The site on which the modern school is situated is land given to the school by Joan Cooke in 1539.

=== Status ===
Despite attempts to change the school, notably in the 1960s with the move to comprehensive schools, the Crypt remains a selective grammar school. In 1987, there was the admission of girls in the sixth form entering in at the age of 16, and the transition towards a fully coeducational school began in 2018. Since April 2011, the school has been an academy independent of local authority control. The school has been fully co-educational since 2018.

=== Primary school ===
In May 2018, the school announced plans to create a primary school, linked to the secondary school being built on the current Podsmead site. The new primary school would, unlike main school, be unselective and would be a free school.

<doc id="1111003" wikidata="Q51060" url="?curid=1111003" title="Ovalle">
<text>Ovalle is a city in the Coquimbo Region of Chile, founded in 1831 as a settlement. It has a population of more than 113,000 people. The name Ovalle was chosen to honor to Chile&#x27;s vice-president, José Tomás Ovalle. Ovalle is the capital of the Limarí Province.

The city&#x27;s setting is often likened to an oasis, being lush and green although surrounded by barren hills.

There is a trail leading from the city that lasts roughly 50 minutes, and features relatively safe bathing and an area where dinosaur fossils can be found. On the trail is a life-sized model of a brachiosaurus.

The town&#x27;s football club is Deportes Ovalle. Famous players have played for the club, including 1982 FIFA World Cup player Rodolfo Dubó.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Ovalle spans an area of and has 98,089 inhabitants (47,805 men and 50,284 women). Of these, 73,790 (75.2%) lived in urban areas and 24,299 (24.8%) in rural areas. The population grew by 15.4% (13,107 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

As a commune, Ovalle is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is Claudio Rentería Larrondo.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Ovalle is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Pedro Velásquez (Ind.) and Matías Walker (PDC) as part of the 8th electoral district, (together with Coquimbo and Río Hurtado). The commune is represented in the Senate by Gonzalo Uriarte (UDI) and Jorge Pizarro Soto (PDC) as part of the 4th senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region).

<text>Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas (21 February 1858 – 16 June 1929) was a British zoologist.

== Career ==
Thomas worked at the Natural History Museum on mammals, describing about 2,000 new species and subspecies for the first time. He was appointed to the museum secretary&#x27;s office in 1876, transferring to the zoological department in 1878.

In 1891, Thomas married Mary Kane, daughter of Sir Andrew Clark, heiress to a small fortune, which gave him the finances to hire mammal collectors and present their specimens to the museum. He also did field work himself in Western Europe and South America. His wife shared his interest in natural history, and accompanied him on collecting trips. In 1896, when William Henry Flower took control of the department, he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions, allowing Thomas to concentrate on these new specimens.

Thomas viewed his taxonomy efforts from the scope of British imperialism. &quot;You and I in our scientific lives have seen the general knowledge of Mammals of the world wonderfully advanced – there are few or no blank areas anymore&quot;, he said in a letter to Gerrit Smith Miller Jr.

Officially retired from the museum in 1923, he continued his work without interruption. Although popular rumours suggested he died by shooting himself with a handgun while sitting at his museum desk, he actually died at home in 1929, aged 71, about a year after the death of his wife, &quot;a severe blow from which he never recovered.&quot;

<doc id="1111006" wikidata="Q7729542" url="?curid=1111006" title="The Deep (aquarium)">
<text>The Deep is a public aquarium situated at Sammy&#x27;s Point, at the confluence of the River Hull and the Humber Estuary in Hull, England. It opened in March 2002.

Billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s only submarium&quot;, the exhibits contain thousands of sea creatures (including seven species of shark), of water and of salt housed in a building designed by Terry Farrell and built as part of the UK National Lottery&#x27;s Millennium Commission project.

The Deep is also a landmark centre for marine research. A team of aquarists look after the animals in The Deep&#x27;s collection as well as carrying out research into the marine environment. In 2013, the aquarium was voted the best family place to visit in Hull.

The Deep is a charitable public aquarium dedicated to increasing people&#x27;s enjoyment and understanding of the world&#x27;s oceans.

==History==

Situated at the confluence of two rivers, Sammy&#x27;s Point has a history going back at least to the 16th century, when Hull Castle was built on part of the site. Parts of this were made into a new fortification (The Citadel) in 1681. When the Victoria Dock was built in 1850, mud that was dug up for the dock was used to extend the foreshore and create the land that now holds The Deep. Sammy&#x27;s Point was named for Martin Samuelson, who built a shipyard there in 1857. The land was bought by a succession of owners, all in the ship business, and was then used by the Humber Conservancy as a buoy depot, but was abandoned in the 1980s.

About half of the financing for the aquarium was from the Millennium Commission, with the rest of the £52.285 million for initial construction coming from various other sources. Operational funding is from membership, ticket, and retail sales. The building was designed by Terry Farrell, and constructed by Mero-Schmidlin; it took 17 months to build and was finished in 2001.

The aquarium opened to the public in 2002. Over eight million people have visited since its opening.

In 2013, the aquarium was voted the best family place to visit in Hull.

The draw for the Third Round Proper of the FA Cup took place on 8 December 2014 at The Deep and was broadcast live on BBC Two.

As part of Made in Hull, the opening season of Hull UK City of Culture 2017 that ran from 1–7 January 2017, &quot;Arrivals and Departures&quot; was projected onto The Deep.

==Exhibits==
The aquarium uses a combination of hands-on interactive displays, audiovisual presentations, and living exhibits to tell the story of the world&#x27;s oceans. The museum includes a series of exhibits presenting a chronological journey from the beginning of time through the present day oceans. There is also an interactive area where visitors can learn to control an underwater diving vessel.

Aquaria exhibits include the Tropical Lagoon of Light, teeming with brightly coloured tropical fish and rays, a Endless Oceans exhibit containing of water, Europe&#x27;s deepest viewing tunnel at , and a glass lift through the tank. The tank is home to sharks, rays and northern Europe&#x27;s only pair of green sawfish along with many other fish. The sharks and rays are fed by divers in a daily show. Other marine life on display include fish that glow in the dark, coral, turtles, jellyfish, frogs, penguins, an Amazon flooded forest and many species of insects.

==Education==
The aquarium&#x27;s education programme hosts 30,000 primary and secondary school students each year. Some of the themes covered in these programmes include food chains, caring for the marine environment, predator-prey relationships, adaptations, and habitats. The Deep also hosts group sleepovers and a variety of special events during the year.

==Two Rivers Restaurant==
From 2002 until the Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020, The Deep was also home to the &quot;Two Rivers Restaurant&quot;, described as one of the most unusual restaurants Hull has to offer. It was located in the heart of the aquarium. The menu was inspired by locally sourced and sustainable ingredients and diners could watch fish swim past in the tank next to them.

==The Deep Business Centre==
To aid the funding of The Deep, The Deep Business Centre was set up. Opening in 2001 The Deep Business Centre has been the home for a wide variety of different companies.

Along with offering fully serviced office spaces to organisations, The Deep Business Centre offers &#x27;Pods&#x27; which are permanent/semi permanent desk spaces and temporary desk spaces. The Deep Business Centre is part of the Flexible Space Association of which the Head of Business and Corporate of The Deep is chair and The Hull &amp; Humber Chamber of Commerce.

<text>Frank Brooks Upham (7 September 1872 – 15 September 1939) served in the United States Navy during the Spanish–American War and as an admiral during World War I.

==Biography==
Born at Fort Apache, Arizona Territory Upham was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 6 September 1889 and graduated on 2 June 1893. Following the completion of the two required years of postgraduate sea duty—which he served with the Pacific Squadron in the protected cruiser —Upham was commissioned an ensign on 1 July 1895 and joined the protected cruiser on 18 July before she sailed for the Far East to become the flagship of the Asiatic Squadron. At the time of the Spanish–American War, Upham was on the staff of the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Squadron, Commodore George Dewey; and the young officer received his baptism of fire during the Battle of Manila Bay.

He advanced up the officer ranks of the Navy, eventually attaining flag rank in 1927. During the years before World War I, Upham&#x27;s sea duty embraced tours in the battleships , , and ; he also commanded &quot;Olympia&quot; and the yacht . He served tours of duty ashore at Newport, Rhode Island, at the Naval War College and in Washington at the Bureau of Ordnance. His overseas shore duty began in the summer of 1911, when he took up the duties of Assistant Naval Attache at Tokyo and Peking, shortly before the outbreak of the Chinese Revolution in October of that year.

During World War I, Upham commanded the cruisers and &quot;Pueblo&quot; and earned the Navy Cross for leading the latter during the &quot;difficult, exacting, and hazardous&quot; convoy escort missions across the Atlantic.

In the years following the armistice, Capt. Upham was chief of staff to the commander, Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet—Rear Admiral Hilary P. Jones—before serving successive tours of shore duty: in Paris as naval attache and in Washington assigned to the Office of Naval Intelligence. He commanded the battleship from September 1924-March 1926 and subsequently filled the billet of commandant of the naval air station at Pensacola, Florida. He capitalized on this assignment to earn his naval aviation observer&#x27;s wings. Reaching flag rank in June 1927, Upham successively commanded Battleship Division 3 and Submarine Divisions, Control Force, and served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.

Given the temporary rank of admiral on 18 August 1933, Upham returned to the Far East as lllCommander in lllChief, Asiatic Fleet, and broke his flag in the heavy cruiser commanded by then-captain Chester W. Nimitz. Relieved by Admiral Orin G. Murfin in October 1935, Upham returned to the U.S. to serve as chairman of the General Board from 20 December 1935 to 30 September 1936.

Placed on the retired list on 1 October 1936, Rear Admiral Upham died in San Francisco, California. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Namesake==
*During World War II, the U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS &quot;Upham&quot; (DE-283) was named for Admiral Upham. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946.
*&quot;SS President Wilson&quot; was intend to be named USS &quot;Admiral F.B. Upham&quot;.

<text>The Swedish Trade Union Confederation ( ; literally &quot;The National Organisation in Sweden&quot;), commonly referred to as LO (), is a national trade union centre, an umbrella organisation for fourteen Swedish trade unions that organise mainly &quot;blue-collar&quot; workers. The Confederation, which gathers around 1.5 million employees out of Sweden&#x27;s 10 million people population, was founded in 1898 by blue-collar unions on the initiative of the 1897 Scandinavian Labour Congress and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, which almost exclusively was made up by trade unions. In 2019 union density of Swedish blue-collar workers was 60%, a decline by seventeen percentage points since 2006 when blue-collar union density was 77%. A strong contributing factor was the considerably raised fees to union unemployment funds in January 2007 made by the new centre-right government.

== History ==
==Organisation==

The fourteen affiliates of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation span both the private and the public sector. The member unions are fully independent, with the role of the Confederation limited to the co-ordination of wage bargaining, international activities, trade union education and other areas. Another important task is to promote the organisation&#x27;s views to decision-makers and the general public. It also has representatives on the governing bodies of many government authorities. The Confederation is also responsible for research and signing labour market insurance schemes. The member unions, however, carry the responsibility for the administration of the unemployment insurance funds.

While its Danish sister organisation, the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, cut its formal ties to the country&#x27;s Social Democratic party in 1995, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation maintains a strong cooperation with the Social Democrats. Although the organisations are independent from each other, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation has a representative on the party&#x27;s executive committee elected by the Party Congress. Also, both the Confederation and the member unions contribute substantial amounts of money to the party.

Until 1987 there was a system of collective membership in the Social Democratic Party for members in the confederation, in which the local union could apply for membership in the Social Democratic Party, effectively enrolling all its members into the Social Democratic Party. (An individual could decline to be part of this collective membership.)

In 1956 social democratic newspaper &quot;Stockholms-Tidningen&quot; was acquired by the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. Until recently, it owned 50.1% of the evening newspaper , the largest daily newspaper in Scandinavia (). As of 2012, the organisation owns 9% of the newspaper. The organisation bought in 1956 but sold off 49.9 percent to the Norwegian media company Schibsted on 2 May 1996.

The number of member unions has been reduced by mergers. Most recently the Forest and Wood Workers&#x27; Union and the Graphic Workers&#x27; Union merged into the single GS Union on 1 June 2009.

<text>Pulickel Madhava Panicker Ajayan, known as P. M. Ajayan, is the Benjamin M. and Mary Greenwood Anderson Professor in Engineering at Rice University, Houston. He is the founding chair of Rice University&#x27;s Materials Science and NanoEngineering department and also holds joint appointments with the Department of Chemistry and Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Prior to joining Rice, he was the Henry Burlage Professor of Material Sciences and Engineering and the director of the NYSTAR interconnect focus center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute until 2007. Known for his pioneering work of designing and carrying out the first experiments to make nanotubes intentionally.

==Early life and education==
Ajayan was born on 15 July 1962 at Kodungallur, a coastal town in Thrissur district, in the Indian state of Kerala, to Malayali parents Pulickel Madhava Panicker, a telephone mechanic, and Radha, a teacher at the local school. He studied in a government school in Kodungallur where the medium of instruction was Malayalam until 6th standard, after which he moved to Loyola School, Thiruvananthapuram, a high school he has credited for making a strong impact on him, and for making him &quot;realize that learning is the most exciting thing one can ever befriend&quot;. He graduated from Loyola in 1977.

In 1985, Ajayan graduated at the top of his class with a BTech degree in Metallurgical Engineering from IIT (BHU) Varanasi. In 1989, he earned a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Afterwards he spent three years as a post-doc at NEC Corporation, two years as a researcher at the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, Orsay, France, and one year at the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research, Stuttgart, Germany.

==Research==
Ajayan is a pioneer in the field of nanotechnology. His PhD work (1989) involved the characterization of gold nanoparticles on oxide substrates and their phase instabilities. He was involved in the early development of carbon nanotubes. From 1991 onwards, at the NEC Fundamental Research Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan, he worked with Sumio Iijima and Thomas Ebbesen and published some of the early works in carbon nanotubes. During the past two decades he has published more than 400 papers on various aspects of carbon nanostructures, mostly on nanotubes and recently on graphene and other layered materials such as boron nitride. Ajayan&#x27;s research interests are broad, focusing on nanomaterials development for a variety of applications such as energy storage, composites, electronics and sensors. His publications have earned more than 68,000 citations on Google Scholar and a h-index of 120 until September 2015. He has to his credit, two Guinness World Records for creating the smallest brush and the darkest material. Ajayan&#x27;s team created the darkest known material, a carpet of carbon nanotubes, that reflects only 0.045% of light. In August 2007, he was in the news for creating an energy storage device on a piece of paper, called the paper battery. In a brief interview with &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;, Ajayan stated he believes the paper battery will have many important future applications in industry and medicine. In 2012, Ajayan&#x27;s group announced a paint-on battery design, which eventually can eliminate restrictions on the surfaces used for energy storage More recently, Ajayan&#x27;s group developed a green battery consisting of environmentally friendly lithium-ion cathode, which can lead to the development of completely bio-friendly batteries Ajayan&#x27;s research group is also focusing on the development of various materials for environmental applications and, last year the group developed a hybrid material capable of effectively removing contaminants from water by coating the sand with carbon. In 2012, Ajayan&#x27;s group developed a macro-scale carbon nanotube sponge, in which nanotubes are covalently connected each other, and demonstrated its selective absorption of oil from oil-water mixture.

Ajayan&#x27;s present research interests include nanotechnology enabled energy storage devices (battery, supercapacitor and hybrid devices), nanocomposites, layered materials, 3D nanostructured materials, and smart material systems. Apart from leading a research group (~40 people, including post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students, and international visiting scholars), he focuses on teaching and lecturing around the world on nanotechnology. He regularly serves on the advisory board of several materials and nanotechnology journals, nanotechnology startups and international conferences. In his role as an academic at Rice and RPI, Ajayan has been a major promoter of nanotechnology, teaching various interdisciplinary courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, emphasising the changes occurring in the science and engineering curriculum. Constantly travelling to expand the field, Ajayan&#x27;s group has a large number of collaborators worldwide and he spends a good amount of time abroad and inside the United States. He has visiting professor positions at various prestigious Universities around the world, such as Tsinghua University (Beijing, China), Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India) and Shinshu University (Japan). He was a visiting professor at ISIS, Strasbourg, France for several months during 2003 and a Helmoltz-Humboldt prize winner and frequent visitor at the Institute of Nanotechnology in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany during 2007–2010. He was listed among the world&#x27;s most cited materials scientists by Elsevier Scopus in 2016.

==Personal life==
Ajayan is married to Poornima and has two daughters, Anakha and Ahi.

<text>Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are antibodies that are secreted by different B cell lineages within the body (whereas monoclonal antibodies come from a single cell lineage). They are a collection of immunoglobulin molecules that react against a specific antigen, each identifying a different epitope.

== Production ==
The general procedure to produce polyclonal antibodies is as follows:
# Antigen preparation
# Adjuvant selection and preparation
# Animal selection
# Injection process
# Blood serum extraction
An antigen/adjuvant conjugate is injected into an animal of choice to initiate an amplified immune response. After a series of injections over a specific length of time, the animal is expected to have created antibodies against the conjugate. Blood is then extracted from the animal and then purified to obtain the antibody of interest.

Inoculation is performed on a suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit or goat. Larger mammals are often preferred as the amount of serum that can be collected is greater. An antigen is injected into the mammal. This induces the B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen. This polyclonal IgG is purified from the mammal&#x27;s serum.

By contrast, monoclonal antibodies are derived from a single cell line.

Many methodologies exist for polyclonal antibody production in laboratory animals. Institutional guidelines governing animal use and procedures relating to these methodologies are generally oriented around humane considerations and appropriate conduct for adjuvant (agents which modify the effect of other agents while having few if any direct effects when given by themselves) use. This includes adjuvant selection, routes and sites of administration, injection volumes per site and number of sites per animal. Institutional policies generally include allowable volumes of blood per collection and safety precautions including appropriate restraint and sedation or anesthesia of animals for injury prevention to animals or personnel.

The primary goal of antibody production in laboratory animals is to obtain high titer, high affinity antisera for use in experimentation or diagnostic tests. Adjuvants are used to improve or enhance an immune response to antigens. Most adjuvants provide for an injection site, antigen depot which allows for a slow release of antigen into draining lymph nodes.

Many adjuvants also contain or act directly as:
# surfactants which promote concentration of protein antigens molecules over a large surface area, and
# immunostimulatory molecules or properties. Adjuvants are generally used with soluble protein antigens to increase antibody titers and induce a prolonged response with accompanying memory.
Such antigens by themselves are generally poor immunogens. Most complex protein antigens induce multiple B-cell clones during the immune response, thus, the response is polyclonal. Immune responses to non-protein antigens are generally poorly or enhanced by adjuvants and there is no system memory.

Antibodies are currently also being produced from isolation of human B-lymphocytes to produce specific recombinant monoclonal antibody mixtures. The biotechnology company, Symphogen, develops this type of antibodies for therapeutic applications. They are the first research company to reach phase two trials with the monoclonal antibody mixtures that mimic the diversity of the polyclonal antibody drugs. This production prevents viral and prion transmission and this is the simple process.

== Animal selection ==
Animals frequently used for polyclonal antibody production include chickens, goats, guinea pigs, hamsters, horses, mice, rats, and sheep. However, the rabbit is the most commonly used laboratory animal for this purpose. Animal selection should be based upon:
# the amount of antibody needed,
# the relationship between the donor of the antigen and the recipient antibody producer (generally the more distant the phylogenetic relationship, the greater the potential for high titer antibody response) and
# the necessary characteristics [e.g., class, subclass (isotype), complement fixing nature] of the antibodies to be made. Immunization and phlebotomies are stress associated and, at least when using rabbits and rodents, specific pathogen free (SPF) animals are preferred. Use of such animals can dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to pathogenic organisms, especially &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; in rabbits.

Goats or horses are generally used when large quantities of antisera are required. Many investigators favor chickens because of their phylogenetic distance from mammals. Chickens transfer high quantities of IgY (IgG) into the egg yolk and harvesting antibodies from eggs eliminates the need for the invasive bleeding procedure. One week&#x27;s eggs can contain 10 times more antibodies than the volume of rabbit blood obtained from one weekly bleeding. However, there are some disadvantages when using certain chicken derived antibodies in immunoassays. Chicken IgY does not fix mammalian complement component C1 and it does not perform as a precipitating antibody using standard solutions.

Although mice are used most frequently for monoclonal antibody production, their small size usually prevents their use for sufficient quantities of polyclonal, serum antibodies. However, polyclonal antibodies in mice can be collected from ascites fluid using any one of a number of ascites producing methodologies.

When using rabbits, young adult animals (2.5–3.0 kg or 5.5–6.5 lb) should be used for primary immunization because of the vigorous antibody response. Immune function peaks at puberty and primary responses to new antigens decline with age. Female rabbits are generally preferred because they are more docile and are reported to mount a more vigorous immune response than males. At least two animals per antigen should be used when using outbred animals. This principle reduces potential total failure resulting from non-responsiveness to antigens of individual animals.

== Antigen preparation ==
The size, extent of aggregation and relative nativity of protein antigens can all dramatically affect the quality and quantity of antibody produced. Small polypeptides (&lt; ) and non-protein antigens generally need to be conjugated or crosslinked to larger, immunogenic, carrier proteins to increase immunogenicity and provide T cell epitopes. Generally, the larger the immunogenic protein the better. Larger proteins, even in smaller amounts, usually result in better engagement of antigen presenting antigen processing cells for a satisfactory immune response. Injection of soluble, non-aggregated proteins has a higher probability of inducing tolerance rather than a satisfactory antibody response.

Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin are two widely used carrier proteins. Poly-L-lysine has also been used successfully as a backbone for peptides. Although the use of Poly-L-lysine reduces or eliminates production of antibodies to foreign proteins, it may result in failure of peptide-induced antibody production. Recently, liposomes have also been successfully used for delivery of small peptides and this technique is an alternative to delivery with oily emulsion adjuvants.

=== Antigen quantity ===
Selection of antigen quantity for immunization varies with the properties of the antigen and the adjuvant selected. In general, microgram to milligram quantities of protein in adjuvant are necessary to elicit high titer antibodies. Antigen dosage is generally species, rather than body weight, associated. The so-called &quot;window&quot; of immunogenicity in each species is broad but too much or too little antigen can induce tolerance, suppression or immune deviation towards cellular immunity rather than a satisfactory humoral response. Optimal and usual protein antigen levels for immunizing specific species have been reported in the following ranges:
# rabbit, 50–1000 μg;
# mouse, 10–50 μg;
# guinea pig, 50–500 μg; and
# goat, 250–5000 μg.
Optimal &quot;priming&quot; doses are reported to be at the low end of each range.

The affinity of serum antibodies increases with time (months) after injection of antigen-adjuvant mixtures and as antigen in the system decreases. Widely used antigen dosages for &quot;booster&quot; or secondary immunizations are usually one half to equal the priming dosages. Antigens should be free of preparative byproducts and chemicals such as polyacrylamide gel, SDS, urea, endotoxin, particulate matter and extremes of pH.

=== Peptide antibodies ===
When a peptide is being used to generate the antibody, it is extremely important to design the antigens properly. There are several resources that can aid in the design as well as companies that offer this service. Expasy has aggregated a set of public tools under its ProtScale page that require some degree of user knowledge to navigate. For a more simple peptide scoring tool there is a Antigen Profiler tool available that will enable you to score individual peptide sequences based upon a relation epitope mapping database of previous immunogens used to generate antibodies. Finally, as a general rule peptides should follow some basic criteria.

When examining peptides for synthesis and immunization, it is recommended that certain residues and sequences be avoided due to potential synthesis problems. This includes some of the more common characteristics:
* Extremely long repeats of the same amino acid (e.g. RRRR)
* Serine (S), Threonine (T), Alanine (A), and Valine (V) doublets
* Ending or starting a sequence with a proline (P)
* Glutamine (Q) or Asparagine (N) at the n-terminus
* Peptides over weighted with hydrophobic residues (e.g. V, A, L, I, etc...)

=== Reactivity ===
Investigators should also consider the status of nativity of protein antigens when used as immunogens and reaction with antibodies produced. Antibodies to native proteins react best with native proteins and antibodies to denatured proteins react best with denatured proteins. If elicited antibodies are to be used on membrane blots (proteins subjected to denaturing conditions) then antibodies should be made against denatured proteins. On the other hand, if antibodies are to be used to react with a native protein or block a protein active site, then antibodies should be made against the native protein. Adjuvants can often alter the nativity of the protein. Generally, absorbed protein antigens in a preformed oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, retain greater native protein structure than those in water-in-oil emulsions.

=== Asepticity ===
Antigens should always be prepared using techniques that ensure that they are free of microbial contamination. Most protein antigen preparations can be sterilized by passage through a 0.22 μm filter. Septic abscesses often occur at inoculation sites of animals when contaminated preparations are used. This can result in failure of immunization against the targeted antigen.

== Adjuvants ==
There are many commercially available immunologic adjuvants. Selection of specific adjuvants or types varies depending upon whether they are to be used for research and antibody production or in vaccine development. Adjuvants for vaccine use only need to produce protective antibodies and good systemic memory while those for antiserum production need to rapidly induce high titer, high avidity antibodies. No single adjuvant is ideal for all purposes and all have advantages and disadvantages. Adjuvant use generally is accompanied by undesirable side effects of varying severity and duration. Research on new adjuvants focuses on substances which have minimal toxicity while retaining maximum immunostimulation. Investigators should always be aware of potential pain and distress associated with adjuvant use in laboratory animals.

The most frequently used adjuvants for antibody production are Freund&#x27;s, Alum, the Ribi Adjuvant System and Titermax.

== Pharmaceutical uses ==
Digoxin Immune Fab is the antigen binding fragment of polyclonal antibodies raised to Digitalis derivative as a hapten bound to a protein and is used for the reversal of life-threatening digoxin or digitoxin toxicity.

Rho(D) immune globulin is made from pooled human plasma provided by Rh-negative donors with antibodies to the D antigen. It is used to provide passive immune binding of antigen, preventing a maternal active immune response which could potentially result in hemolytic disease of the newborn.

Rozrolimupab is the anti-RhD recombinant human polyclonal antibody composed of 25 unique IgG1 antibodies and is used for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia purpura and prevention of isoimmunization in Rh-negative pregnant women.

REGN-COV2 (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) – potential treatment for people with COVID-19 and to prevent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.

== Advantages ==
The use of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) over monoclonal antibodies has its advantages. The technical skills needed to produce polyclonal antibodies is not as demanding. They&#x27;re inexpensive to make and can be generated fairly quickly, taking up to several months to produce. PAbs are heterogeneous, which allows them to bind to a wide range of antigen epitopes. Because PAbs are produced from a large number of B cell clones, they&#x27;re more likely to successfully bind to a specific antigen. PAbs remain stable in different environments, such as a change in pH or salt concentration, which allows them to be more applicable in certain procedures. Additionally, depending on the amount needed, PAbs can be made in large quantities in relation to the size of the animal used.

== Drawbacks ==
There are drawbacks using polyclonal antibodies over monoclonal antibodies. This is mostly on the reproducibility aspect. pAbs are generated by immune response to antigen. Individual animal or human will generate different antibodies against the same antigen. In the case of multiple exposure of the same antigen, the pAbs mixture will be different over time. This so called &#x27;batch-to-batch&#x27; variability is one of the biggest concerns in using pAbs. 

== Recombinant Polyclonal Antibodies ==
Despite the drawbacks, polyclonal antibodies&#x27; broad epitope recognition and higher sensitivity are key across different applications. Scientists use mixtures of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to mimic pAbs. The recombinant production of mAbs solved the variability and reproducibility concerns in pAbs. The mixture of many mAbs will mimic pAbs&#x27; broader epitope recognition and higher sensitivity. Recent technology advancements allowed the direct sequencing of polyclonal antibody proteins from human and immunized animals. Those antibody proteins can then be recombinantly produced to mimic the original pAbs generated by the immune system.

<doc id="1111022" wikidata="Q443055" url="?curid=1111022" title="Sebastian Faulks">
<text>Sebastian Charles Faulks (born 20 April 1953) is a British novelist, journalist and broadcaster. He is best known for his historical novels set in France – &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot;, &quot;Birdsong&quot; and &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot;. 

He has also published novels with a contemporary setting, most recently &quot;A Week in December&quot; (2009) and &quot;Paris Echo&quot;, (2018) and a James Bond continuation novel, &quot;Devil May Care&quot; (2008), as well as a continuation of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves series, &quot;Jeeves and the Wedding Bells&quot; (2013). He was a team captain on BBC Radio 4 literary quiz &quot;The Write Stuff&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Faulks was born on 20 April 1953 in Donnington, Berkshire, to Peter Faulks and Pamela (née Lawless). His father was a decorated soldier (he won the Military Cross), who later became a solicitor and circuit judge. His brother Edward Faulks, Baron Faulks KC, a barrister, became a Conservative Government Minister in January 2014 in the Ministry of Justice. His uncle was Sir Neville Faulks, a High Court judge.

He was educated at Elstree School, Reading, and went on to Wellington College, Berkshire. He read English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he was made an honorary fellow in 2008. Whilst at Cambridge he participated in &quot;University Challenge&quot;, in which Emmanuel College lost in the opening round. Faulks commented that his team was most probably hampered by a trip to the pub before the show, as recommended by the show&#x27;s producer.

===Career===

After graduating, Faulks worked as a teacher at a private school in Camden Town, and then as a journalist for the &quot;Daily&quot; and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;. Faulks&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Trick of the Light&quot;, was published in 1984. He continued to work as a journalist, becoming the first literary editor of &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1986. He became deputy editor of the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; in 1989; in the same year he published &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot;, the first of his historical novels set in France. In 1991 he left &quot;The Independent.&quot; He wrote for various newspapers as a freelancer for the next ten years.

Following the success of &quot;Birdsong&quot; (1993), Faulks quit journalism to write full-time. He has since published eight novels, the most recent being &quot;Where My Heart Used to Beat&quot; (2015), &quot;Paris Echo&quot; (2018) and &quot;Snow Country&quot; (2021). Faulks was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993 and appointed CBE for services to literature in 2002.

Faulks appears regularly on British TV and radio. He was a regular team captain on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s literary quiz &quot;The Write Stuff&quot; (1998–2014). The quiz involves the panellists each week writing a pastiche of the work of a selected author; Faulks has published a collection of his efforts as a book, &quot;Pistache&quot; (2006), which was described in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as &quot;a little treasure of a book. Faulks can catch, and caricature, another writers&#x27; fingerprints and foibles with a delicious precision that only a deep love of writing can teach.&quot; 

In 2011 Faulks presented a four-part BBC Two series called &quot;Faulks on Fiction&quot;, looking at the British novel and its characters. He also wrote a series tie-in book of the same name.

===Personal life===
Faulks married Veronica (née Youlten) in 1989. They have two sons, William and Arthur, born 1990 and 1996 respectively, and one daughter, Holly, born 1992. Faulks is a fan of West Ham United football club. Debrett&#x27;s lists his recreations as tennis and wine.

A longtime cricket fan and player, Faulks is a member of the Authors XI cricket team.

In August 2014, Faulks was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

From 2013 to 2018, he sat on the Government Advisory Group for the Commemoration of the First World War.

==Novels==
The &quot;Literary Review&quot; has said that &quot;Faulks has the rare gift of being popular and literary at the same time&quot;; &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; called him &quot;One of the most impressive novelists of his generation ... who is growing in authority with every book&quot;. Faulks&#x27;s 2005 novel, &quot;Human Traces&quot;, was described by Trevor Nunn as &quot;A masterpiece, one of the great novels of this or any other century.&quot;

Faulks is best known for his three novels set in early twentieth-century France. The first, &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot;, was published in 1989. This was followed by &quot;Birdsong&quot; (1993), and &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; (1998). The latter two were best-sellers, and &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; was shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. In April 2003 &quot;Birdsong&quot; came 13th in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Read&quot; initiative which aimed to identify Britain&#x27;s best loved novels.

In 2007, Faulks published &quot;Engleby&quot;. Set in Cambridge in the 1970s, it is narrated by Cambridge University fresher Mike Engleby. Engleby is a loner, and the reader is led to suspect that he may be unreliable, particularly when a fellow student disappears. Faulks says of the novel&#x27;s genesis, &quot;I woke up one morning with this guy&#x27;s voice in my head. And he was just talking, dictating, almost. And when I got to work, I wrote it down. I didn&#x27;t know what the hell was going on; this wasn&#x27;t an idea for a book.&quot; It was remarked upon as a change of direction for Faulks, both in terms of the near-contemporary setting and in the decision to use a first-person narrator. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said the book was &quot;distinguished by a remarkable intellectual energy: a narrative verve, technical mastery of the possibilities of the novel form and vivid sense of the tragic contingency of human life.&quot;

To mark the 2008 centenary of Ian Fleming&#x27;s birth, the author&#x27;s estate in 2006 commissioned Faulks to write a new James Bond novel. Faulks has said of the commission: &quot;I&#x27;d just finished &quot;Human Traces&quot; and it seemed ridiculous. You&#x27;ve just spent five years in a Victorian lunatic asylum and then you go on to James Bond. But I think their hope is they&#x27;ll get two markets. The more I think about it, the more I think it was clever of them, because the mismatch is intriguing.&quot; The result, &quot;Devil May Care&quot;, became an immediate best-seller in the UK, selling 44,093 hardback copies within four days of release. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s review of the novel stated: &quot;Faulks has done in some ways an absolutely sterling job. He has resisted pastiche&quot;, and blamed the book&#x27;s weaknesses on the character of Bond as created by Fleming. Mark Lawson, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, praised it as &quot;a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post-Fleming Bonds, this must surely compete with Kingsley Amis&#x27;s for the title of the best&quot;.

Faulks&#x27;s 2009 novel, &quot;A Week in December&quot;, takes place in the seven days leading up to Christmas in December 2007. It focuses on the lives of a varied cast of characters living in London; Faulks himself has described the novel as &quot;Dickensian&quot; and cites &quot;Bleak House&quot; and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; as influences, as well as New York novelists such as Tom Wolfe and Jay McInerney. The book was partly a response to the banking crisis. He chose to set it specifically in 2007 because &quot;the whole world had changed: the banks were collapsing, we were facing Armageddon, and I understood then that I couldn&#x27;t make this book right up to the moment[...] I chose that time because then the writing&#x27;s on the wall, and it should be clear to anyone half-sensible that the game is up, but they&#x27;re still going on.&quot; 

Other plot threads in the novel concern reality television, and Islamic militancy. While publicising the book, Faulks received some criticism for negative remarks he made about the Koran; he was quick to offer &quot;a simple but unqualified apology to my Muslim friends and readers for anything that has come out sounding crude or intolerant. Happily, there is more to the book than that&quot;. Reviews for the novel were mixed. Tibor Fischer, in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;comic élan&quot;, but felt it was &quot;uneven&quot; and criticised the character of John Veals as &quot;lifeless&quot;. Mark Lawson wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;an honest critic must surely conclude that Faulks has correctly identified the novel that needs to be written about these times, but may also have proved that British society is now so various that no single writer can capture all its aspects. However, in honourably failing to depict the entire state of the nation, Faulks has memorably skewered the British literary world.&quot;

His latest novel titled &quot;The Seventh Son&quot; was published in September 2023. Despite some reservations, Melissa Katsoulis praised the book in &quot;The Times&quot; and stated that there are &quot;some high ideas at work here and, as with the best dystopian fictions, all the crazy future science stuff feels scary precisely because it’s close to happening already.&quot;

==Adaptations of novels==
In 2001 &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett and directed by Gillian Armstrong. In 2010 a stage version of &quot;Birdsong&quot;, adapted by Rachel Wagstaff (who had previously adapted &quot;The Girl at the Lion d&#x27;Or&quot; for radio) and directed by Trevor Nunn, opened at the Comedy Theatre in London; the production ran for only 4 months. It was subsequently rewritten by Wagstaff and made four successful nationwide tours. In 2012, &quot;Birdsong&quot; was made into a two-part BBC TV serial, written by Abi Morgan, directed by Philip Martin and starring Eddie Redmayne. This followed several attempts to film the novel.

<text>Sir Edwin Ray Lankester (15 May 1847 – 13 August 1929) was a British zoologist.

An invertebrate zoologist and evolutionary biologist, he held chairs at University College London and Oxford University. He was the third Director of the Natural History Museum, London, and was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society.

== Life ==
Ray Lankester was born on 15 May 1847 on Burlington Street in London, the son of Edwin Lankester, a coroner and doctor-naturalist who helped eradicate cholera in London, and his wife, the botanist and author Phebe Lankester. Ray Lankester was probably named after the naturalist John Ray: his father had just edited the memorials of John Ray for the Ray Society.

In 1855 Ray went to boarding school at Leatherhead, and in 1858 to St Paul&#x27;s School. His university education was at Downing College, Cambridge, and Christ Church, Oxford; he transferred from Downing, after five terms, at his parents&#x27; behest because Christ Church had better teaching in the form of the newly appointed George Rolleston.

Lankester achieved first-class honours in 1868. His education was rounded off by study visits to Vienna, Leipzig and Jena, and he did some work at the Stazione Zoologica at Naples. He took the examination to become a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and studied under Thomas H. Huxley before taking his MA.

Lankester therefore had a far better education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it could be argued that the influence of his father Edwin and his friends were just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.

He was a large man with a large presence, of warm human sympathies and in his childhood a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln. His interventions, responses and advocacies were often colourful and forceful, as befitted an admirer of Huxley, for whom he worked as a demonstrator when a young man. In his personal manner he was not so adept as Huxley, and he made enemies by his rudeness. This undoubtedly damaged and limited the second half of his career.

Lankester appears, thinly disguised, in several novels. He is the model for Sir Roderick Dover in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Marriage&quot; (Wells had been one of his students), and in Robert Briffault&#x27;s &quot;Europa&quot;, which contains a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with Karl Marx. (Lankester was one of the thirteen people at Marx&#x27;s funeral.) He has also been suggested as the model for Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;, but Doyle himself said that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named William Rutherford.

Lankester never married. In 1895, he was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest while in the company of a group of female prostitutes on the street, but was acquitted. (It is incorrect, as has been alleged, that the charge concerned homosexual offences.) He died in London on 13 August 1929.

A finely decorated memorial plaque to him can be seen at the Golders Green Crematorium, Hoop Lane, London.

== Career ==
Lankester became a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1873. He co-edited the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science&quot; which his father had founded. From 1869 until his death he edited this journal (jointly with his father, 1869–1871). He worked as one of Huxley&#x27;s team at the new buildings in South Kensington, and after the death of Francis Balfour became Huxley&#x27;s intended successor.

Lankester was appointed Jodrell Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy and curator of what is now the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London from 1874 to 1890, Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Merton College, Oxford, from 1891 to 1898, and director of the Natural History Museum from 1898 to 1907. He was a founder in 1884 of the Marine Biological Association and served as its second President between 1890 and 1929. Influential as teacher and writer on biological theories, comparative anatomy, and evolution, Lankester studied the protozoa, mollusca, and arthropoda. Lankester was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1902, and an International Member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1903. He was knighted in 1907, awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1913, and the Linnean Society of London&#x27;s Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908.

At University College London (the &#x27;Godless Institute of Gower Street&#x27;) Lankester taught Raphael Weldon (1860–1906), who went on to succeed him in the chair at UCL. Another interesting student was Alfred Gibbs Bourne, who went on to hold senior positions in biology and education in the Indian Empire. When Lankester left to take up the Linacre chair at Oxford in 1891, the Grant Museum at UCL continued to grow under Weldon who added a number of extremely rare specimens. Weldon is perhaps best known for founding the science of biometry with Francis Galton (1822–1911) and Karl Pearson (1857–1936). He followed Lankester to Oxford in 1899.
After Huxley the most important influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected Lamarckism, and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution at a time when other biologists had doubts. Weismann&#x27;s separation of germplasm (genetic material) from soma (somatic cells) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester was one of the first to see its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann&#x27;s essays, some of which he translated into English.

Lankester was hugely influential, though perhaps more as a teacher than as a researcher. Ernst Mayr said &quot;It was Lankester who founded a school of selectionism at Oxford&quot;. Those he influenced (in addition to Weldon) included Edwin Stephen Goodrich (Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford 1921–1946) and (indirectly) Julian Huxley (the evolutionary synthesis). In turn their disciples, such as E. B. Ford (ecological genetics), Gavin de Beer (embryology and evolution), Charles Elton (ecology) and Alister Hardy (marine biology) held sway during the middle years of the 20th century.

As a zoologist Lankester was a comparative anatomist of the Huxley school, working mostly on invertebrates. He was the first to show the relationship of the horseshoe crab or &quot;Limulus&quot; to the Arachnida. His &quot;Limulus&quot; specimens can still be seen in the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL today. He was also a voluminous writer on biology for the general readership; in this he followed the example of his old mentor, Huxley.

He published over 200 papers during his career. For an overview of his scientific work, see the obituary notice by Edwin S. Goodrich.

=== Invertebrates and degeneration ===
Lankester&#x27;s books &quot;Developmental history of the Mollusca&quot; (1875) and &quot;Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism&quot; (1880) established him as a leader in the study of invertebrate life histories. In &quot;Degeneration&quot; he adapted some ideas of Ernst Haeckel and Anton Dohrn (the founder and first director of the Stazione Zoologica, Naples). Connecting Dohrn&#x27;s work with Darwinism, Lankester held that degeneration was one of three general avenues that evolution might take (the others being balance and elaboration). Degeneration was a suppression of form, &quot;Any new set of conditions occurring to an animal which render its food and safety very easily attained, seem to lead to as a rule to Degeneration&quot;. Degeneration was well known in parasites, and Lankester gave several examples. In &quot;Sacculina&quot;, a genus of barnacles which is a parasite of crabs, the female is little more than &quot;a sac of eggs, and absorbed nourishment from the juices of its host by root-like processes&quot; (+ wood-engraved illustration). He called this degenerative evolutionary process in parasites &quot;retrogressive metamorphosis&quot;.

Lankester pointed out that retrograde metamorphosis could be seen in many species that were not, strictly speaking, degenerate. &quot;Were it not for the recapitulative phases of the barnacle, we may doubt whether naturalists would &quot;ever&quot; have guessed it was a crustacean.&quot; The lizard &quot;Seps&quot; has limbs which are &quot;ridiculously small&quot;, and &quot;Bipes&quot;, a burrowing lizard, has no front limbs, and rear limbs reduced to stumps. The Dibamidae are legless lizards of tropical forests who also adopt the burrowing habit. Snakes, which have evolved unique forms of locomotion, and are probably derived from lizards. Thus degeneration or retrogressive metamorphosis sometimes occurs as species adapt to changes in habit or way of life.

As evidence of degeneration, Lankester identifies the recapitulative development of the individual. This is the idea propagated by Ernst Haeckel as a source of evolutionary evidence (recapitulation theory). As antecedents of degeneration, Lankester lists:
:1. Parasitism
:2. Fixity or immobility (sessile habit)
:3. Vegetative nutrition
:4. Excessive reduction in size
He also considered the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst still in its gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult. Lankester noted that this process could take the subsequent evolution of the race into a totally different and otherwise improbable direction. This idea, which Lankester called &quot;super-larvation&quot;, is now called neoteny.

Lankester extended the idea of degeneration to human societies, which carries little significance today, but it is a good example of a biological concept invading social science. Lankester and H. G. Wells used the idea as a basis for propaganda in favour of social and educational reform.

=== Trouble at the Museum ===
In Lankester&#x27;s time the Natural History Museum had its own building in South Kensington, but in financial and administrative matters it was subordinate to the British Museum. Moreover, the Superintendent (= Director) of the NHM was the subordinate of the Principal Librarian of the BM, a fact which was bound to cause trouble since that august person was not a scientist. We can see that the conflict which took place was one aspect of the struggle undertaken, in their different ways, by Owen, Hooker, Huxley and Tyndall to emancipate science from enslavement by traditional forces.

There was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, who was on the point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the palaeographer, was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended to take control of the whole Museum, including the Natural History departments. In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, Mitchell, Poulton, and Weldon were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).

Lankester was appointed in 1898, and the outcome was inevitable. Eight years of conflict with Maunde Thompson followed, with Thompson constantly interfering in the affairs of the museum and obstructing Lankester&#x27;s attempt to improve the museum. Lankester resigned in 1907, at the direction of Thompson, who had discovered a clause in the regulations which allowed him to call for the resignation of officials at the age of 60. Lazarus Fletcher was appointed in his stead. There was a vast clamour in the press, and from foreign zoologists protesting at the treatment of Lankester. That Lankester had some friends in high places was shown by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering him an enhanced pension, and the knighthood that was bestowed on him the next year.

The issues raised by this affair did not end there. Eventually the NHM gained, first, its administrative freedom, then finally there was a complete separation from the BM. Today the British Library, the British Museum and the Natural History Museum all occupy separate buildings, and have complete legal, administrative and financial independence from each other.

=== Rationalism ===
Lankester had close family connections with Suffolk (the Woodbridge and Felixstowe area), and was an active member of the Rationalist group associated with the circle of Thomas Huxley, Samuel Laing and others. He was a friend of the Rationalist Edward Clodd of Aldeburgh. From 1901 to his death in 1929 he was Honorary President of the Ipswich Museum. He became convinced of the human workmanship of the (now unfavoured) &#x27;Pre-palaeolithic&#x27; implements and rostro-carinates, and championed their cause at the Royal Society in 1910–1912. Through correspondence he became the scientific mentor of the Suffolk prehistorian James Reid Moir (1879–1944). He was a friend of Karl Marx in the latter&#x27;s later years and was among the few persons present at his funeral.

Lankester was active in attempting to expose the frauds of Spiritualist mediums during the 1920s. He was an important writer of popular science, his weekly newspaper columns over many years being assembled and reprinted in a series of books entitled &quot;Science from an Easy Chair&quot; (first series, 1910; second series, 1912).

<doc id="1111026" wikidata="Q7844530" url="?curid=1111026" title="Triumph slant-four engine">
<text>The Triumph slant-four is an inline four-cylinder petrol car engine developed by the Triumph Motor Company. It first appeared in 1968 in the Saab 99. The first Triumph model to use the engine did not appear until 1972. With an original capacity of 1.7 L, displacement grew over time to 2.0 L. Triumph production ended in 1981.

==History==
In 1963 Triumph&#x27;s Chief Engine Designer Lewis Dawtrey presented the results of his analysis of future engine technology trends and Triumph&#x27;s anticipated needs. After evaluating rotary, horizontally opposed, V4 and V6 configurations Dawtrey recommended an OHC engine family composed of both Inline-4 and V8 engines that could be built with the same tooling. The new range would be built in capacities of 1.5 L to 3.0 L, allowing it to replace both the four-cylinder Standard SC and derivative Triumph I6 engines whose roots reached back to the Standard Eight of 1953. The recommendation was accepted and development began in-house at Triumph by a design team led by Dawtrey and Harry Webster. The initial model was to be a 1.5 L inline four.

At about the same time Saab was working on designing and building 55 hp 1.2-litre and 68 hp 1.5-litre prototype inline four engines for their upcoming 99 model. UK engineering and consultancy company Ricardo was involved in the Saab project and, while not directly involved in development of the slant-four, did have a general engine-development contract with Triumph and was aware of their progress. When Saab determined that developing their own engine would be too expensive and too risky, Ricardo put Saab into contact with Triumph.

Triumph agreed to supply Saab with 50,000 slant-four engines per year for the new 99. Displacement had risen from 1.5 L to 1.7 L. Saab had exclusive use of the slant-four for the first several years of production. Saab retained its existing transaxle, which was configured to be driven from the front of the engine. This required that the slant-four be turned 180° so that the clutch and flywheel were in the front. A consequence of this is that the &quot;front&quot;-mounted water pump would be facing the firewall/bulkhead and be inaccessible, prompting it to be relocated to the top of the cylinder block.

The engine was used first by Triumph in the Dolomite 1850, which appeared in 1972. The regular Dolomite used the 1.85 L engine, while the sportier Dolomite Sprint, unveiled in June 1973, got both a new cylinder head and an increase in displacement to 2.0 L. The slant-four was also used by Panther in the Dolomite-based Rio (1975–1977). The TR7 debuted in 1975 with the 2.0 L engine and 8-valve cylinder head. A few pre-production TR7 Sprint models received the sportier Sprint engine in 1977. Triumph stopped producing the slant-four when the TR7 was discontinued in 1981.

The V8 member of the engine family first appeared in a Triumph vehicle in 1970, fully two years before the slant-four. Development of the V8 had continued throughout the mid- to late-1960s, with early engines displacing 2.5 L. When Charles Spencer (Spen) King took over as Head of Engineering from Webster, he authorized continued development of the Triumph V8, and was also instrumental in getting the car it powered, the Triumph Stag, into production. The production V8 displaced 3.0 L.

==Technical features==
The slant-four&#x27;s engine block is of cast iron (called &quot;chrome iron&quot; in some references). The cylinders are inclined at an angle of 45° from vertical. This allowed the engine to be built with the same tooling needed for a V8, and reduced the overall engine height, permitting lower bonnets. The crankshaft ran in five main bearings. The pistons are aluminium with three rings. All slant-fours are oversquare, with the larger capacity versions being even more so, as the increase in displacement came from increasing the bore diameter while holding the stroke length constant.

The cylinder head was cast from aluminium alloy. Combustion chambers were wedge-shaped. The single overhead camshaft was driven by a single-row chain. The eight valves, two per cylinder, were inline and were operated on by the camshaft through bucket tappets with shims for adjustment.

==Sprint 16-valve engine==
Triumph added a unique 16-valve cylinder head to the slant-four for the 1973 Dolomite Sprint. At the time there were at British Leyland (BL) both Harry Mundy, who worked on engine development at Jaguar, and Walter Hassan, also at Jaguar but in charge of engine technology development at BL as well. These two shared data on four-valve cylinder heads with King. 

A team of engineers led by King and &quot;with co-operation from Harry Mundy and the engineers at Coventry Climax&quot;, developed a 4-valve-per-cylinder head where all of the valves are actuated by a single camshaft rather than the more conventional DOHC arrangement. The valves are arranged in two rows of eight, inclined 27° from vertical. The inlet valves are in diameter and are operated by the camshaft lobes through bucket tappets, while the exhaust valves are in diameter and are operated through rocker arms. The design of the cylinder head won a British Design Council award in 1974.

Capacity was increased to , and larger HS6 SU carburettors were fitted. Other changes to the Sprint engine included a duplex timing chain and alloy timing cover. The big-end journals were also cross-drilled.

The engine was expected to make 135 bhp, and King returned from holiday &quot;to find an engine running on the bed giving 150 bhp at the first build.&quot; Hence, it was initially intended to be named the &#x27;Dolomite 135&#x27;. This was changed to &#x27;Dolomite Sprint&#x27; and published reasons vary. One oft-repeated rumour is that production lines could not guarantee 135 bhp. However according to Matthew Vale, it was during development that Triumph switched to measuring power from imperial (SAE) to metric (DIN), which calculated outputs approximately 5% lower. In this case 135 bhp SAE is 127 bhp DIN.

The Dolomite Sprint has been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s first mass-produced multi-valve car&quot;. Multi-valve engines had first appeared in 1912, with the most recent prior to the release of the Sprint engine being the Cosworth BDA (1969) and Lotus 907 (1972), but they had not been not used in mass-production vehicles until after the introduction of the Dolomite Sprint.

The 16-valve 2.0 L engine was also used in a small number of prototype and pre-production TR7 Sprints built at Triumph&#x27;s plant in Speke during 1977.

==Saab B engine==

In 1972 Saab brought production of the 1.85 L slant-four in-house to their Scania division at a facility in Södertälje. An uncorroborated letter to the editor of Motor Sport magazine references a Saab press release of July 1970 that indicates that this was planned from the outset. Following the transfer Saab embarked on a redesign of the engine that resulted in the Saab B engine. Displacement increased to 2.0 L, but the bore diameter was smaller than the enlarged Triumph version, resulting in a swept volume of .

Saab&#x27;s B engine shared much with the original Triumph design, including bore centres and bearings, but some previously problematic features, such as the water-pump and its seal, were redesigned.

==Slant-four variants==
==Motorsports==
The 16-valve Sprint engine was raced in FIA Group 1 and Group 2 in Dolomite Sprints prepared by Leyland Special Tuning at Abingdon. Their first season was 1974, but no finishes were achieved that year. In 1975 the engines received larger carburettors and a revised camshaft. With these changes they completed their first event at the Mintex Rally in 7th place. This was followed by a 2nd place in the Avon Tour of Britain and a 3rd at the Lindisfarne Rally. At the Lombard RAC Rally the Dolomite Sprint won the 2-litre class and Group 1 outright and placed 16th overall. For 1976 focus had shifted to the TR7, originally with the Sprint engine but by 1978 all efforts were focused on the TR8.

The private Broadspeed team headed by Ralph Broad did extensive development on the Sprint engine, bringing power up to a claimed . Sprint-powered Broadspeed cars won the Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship in 1974 and took the driver&#x27;s title in 1975. In 1976 the cars took 2nd in the 2-litre class, and won again in 1978.

The Sprint engine also appeared in Formula Three, in Anson Cars and March Engineering chassis. The Sprint-powered March placed 8th in the 1976 season. In 1979 two March cars driven by Nigel Mansell and Brett Riley finished 5th and 8th in the F3 championship and each driver won one race in the Vandervell British F3 Championship.

<text>Brännkyrka is a parish in South Stockholm, Sweden. The population is 36,572.

Brännkyrka, at that time much larger in area, was amalgamated into the city of Stockholm in 1913. This area now constitutes the southern main part of Stockholm Municipality called Söderort. The original parish has since then been divided into many new parishes and the present Brännkyrka parish is situated around Brännkyrka church in the centre of the area.

Brännkyrka was the site of a Swedish victory over Danish forces in 1518.

Parts of the church were built in the 12th century. There are notes that there has been four serious fires in the church. It is assumed that the name Brännkyrka (&quot;burnt church&quot;) was given after a fire around 1400, since it was named &quot;Vantör&quot; before that time.

The Brännkyrka basketball team is very popular amongst locals, and their matches at the Brännkyrka gymnasium are always a fun a happy gathering of the community.

<doc id="1111033" wikidata="Q1700218" url="?curid=1111033" title="John Gilbert (naturalist)">
<text>John Gilbert (c. 1812 – 28 June 1845) was an English naturalist and explorer. Gilbert is often cited in the earliest descriptions of many Australian animals, many of which were unrecorded in European literature, and some of these are named for him by those authors. Gilbert was sent to the newly founded Swan River Colony and made collections and notes on the unique birds and mammals of the surrounding region. He later joined expeditions to remote parts the country, continuing to make records and collections until he was killed during a violent altercation at Mitchell River (Queensland) on the Cape York Peninsula.

==Early life==
John Gilbert was born in about 1812 in Newington Butts, south London, England, and was christened on 25 October 1812 at Spa Fields Lady Huntingdon&#x27;s, Clerkenwell, London. His father was William, and his mother was Ann, who was from nearby villages in Kent.

Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London, where he met John Gould. Gould had recruited Gilbert, four years his junior, to work there. But 18 months later, Gilbert was sacked for being absent without leave.

==Australian expeditions==
Gilbert travelled to Australia in 1838 with the Goulds and their young nephew Henry William Coxen. Gilbert was paid 100 pounds per annum plus expenses, but he was expected to account meticulously for every penny and to keep his expenses as small as possible. Gould and Gilbert reached Hobart on the &quot;Parsee&quot; on 19 September 1838. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months.

The party landed in Hobart, Tasmania in September, and in January, Gilbert and Gould traveled overland together to Launceston. Gould decided they should separate and sent Gilbert off on 4 February 1839 to the Swan River Colony, assuring him that he would look after all his personal possessions which were still in Hobart. Gilbert was instructed to collect as many specimens as possible, then meet up again in Sydney, where Gould would wait for him until the end of April the following year. He worked mostly in the vicinity of Perth, gathering specimens for Gould for 11 months.

Gilbert disembarked from the ship &quot;Comet&quot; on 6 March 1839 at Fremantle, Western Australia, the port of the colony in its first decade. He met Francis Armstrong within a few days, who was acquainted with the Nyungar peoples of the region, and began to make collections in the area around the Swan River and York. His arrival began a period of ornithological research that saw a large number of his specimens described and depicted by the Goulds, many of which were &quot;discovered&quot;, the field notes that accompanied these gave details of birds of the west that allowed inclusion in their ambitious publication.

Meanwhile, Gould returned to Hobart, where his wife Elizabeth awaited him. They lived in style with their servants in Government House. Taking one servant with him, Gould visited New South Wales and was made welcome by his wife&#x27;s family, the Coxen&#x27;s and other wealthy landlords. He returned to Hobart just in time for the birth of his seventh child (a son they named Franklin Tasman). Almost immediately, Gould set off again, this time for South Australia, where he met the Governor and accompanied Charles Sturt on his expedition to the Murray Scrubs. When he returned to Hobart, the Goulds travelled together to New South Wales, where Elizabeth&#x27;s brothers lived. Gould collected many birds and mammals, some of which were new to science. The Goulds left for England on 9 April.

When Gilbert arrived in Sydney on 30 April, he found his employer gone. To rub salt in his wound, his trunk had been ransacked and many of the possessions that Gould had promised to protect, had been stolen. Gilbert had provided Gould with thousands of specimens of every description, from quadrupeds to insects, from shells to crustacea, from plants to reptiles, but mainly and most importantly, birds and eggs. He had provided Gould with over 60 new species of birds, including the extinct paradise parrot which he first discovered in the Darling Downs in June 1844.

Gilbert travelled by boat to Port Essington, north of where Darwin is today. There, he collected, among many other things, a beautiful, newly discovered finch and returned with it to Gould in England. there he found his employer mourning his wife, Elizabeth, who had died after the birth of their eighth child. She was just 37. Gould named the finch after his wife, so Elizabeth is remembered today in this gorgeous little bird, called not Elizabeth&#x27;s finch, but more cryptically, the &quot;Gouldian finch&quot;. As Elizabeth was the illustrator of all the works, not her husband, Gould then needed to recruit other artists to finish the work that Elizabeth had tirelessly begun.

Gilbert soon returned to Australia to collect again for Gould. He discovered the paradise parrot and thought it &#x27;without exception the most beautiful of the whole tribe I have ever yet seen in Australia.&#x27; He begged Gould to name it after him, saying, &#x27;I know of no species that would delight me more to see &quot;gilbertii&quot; attached to than this beautiful bird.&#x27; Gould declined, saying he did not like naming species after people, and anyway, he had just recently named another species after him. Apparently, Gould saw no contradiction in this explanation and though the paradise parrot is now extinct, Gilbert is remembered in the Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;whistler&quot;.

Naming the Gilbert&#x27;s whistler was one of Gould&#x27;s rare ornithological mistakes. He had already named the eastern race of the same bird, calling it the &#x27;unadorned thickhead&#x27;, perhaps giving some indication of what he thought of the bird. By convention, the first name stands, so today the scientific name is &quot;Pachycephalia inornata&quot;. But while technically speaking, the name Gilbert&#x27;s whistler refers just to the western race of the bird, the name is used universally today for the species. Gould also honoured Gilbert when naming two animals that Gilbert had collected for him from the dense heath in the south-west of Western Australia, Gilbert&#x27;s dunnart and Gilbert&#x27;s potoroo.

Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 new species from Western Australia, and 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844, he was back in Sydney, and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland. The Coxen family who settled the Darling Downs region were related by marriage; Gould&#x27;s wife Elizabeth (née Coxen) was sister to Charles and Stephen, and aunt to Henry William Coxen. The families allowed Gould and Gilbert to stay on their properties to collect fauna and flora of the district.

==Leichhardt&#x27;s expedition==

While Gilbert was considering which part of the continent should next be investigated, Ludwig Leichhardt arrived with the other members of his expedition to Port Essington (east of Darwin, and since abandoned), and Gilbert was allowed to join the party in September 1844. In November, they decided the party was too large for the amount of provisions they had with them, and Leichhardt ruled that the two who had joined last should return. Eventually, however, it was decided that Hodgson and Caleb should return, and Gilbert remained to become later on practically the second in command of the expedition. One member of the party, a boy of 16, was too young to be of much use and the leader&#x27;s treatment of the two Aboriginal members of the party was lacking in tact and consideration. A good deal of responsibility, therefore, fell upon Gilbert, who was the best bushman of a very mixed company. The progress made for several months was much less than was anticipated and, by May 1845, supplies of food were running very short.

==Death==

On 28 June 1845 at the Mitchell River near Dunbar, Queensland on the Cape York Peninsula near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed by a flying spear when Aboriginal locals made a night attack on the expedition&#x27;s camp because some of their women had been molested by the two Aboriginal members of the Leichhardt party. There still exists some controversy over his deaththe wound was apparently smaller than a spear, and some suggest he died from an accidental shooting by one of his companions. He was buried on the spot, a tree nearby was marked, and a fire was lit over the disturbed earth to screen the grave; this, although much searched for, has not since been found.

==Aftermath==
Other members of the expedition received several spear thrusts but recovered. Leichhardt then turned south-westerly, skirting the gulf for a while, and reached Port Essington almost exhausted in December 1845. Leichhardt preserved Gilbert&#x27;s papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Almost everything known about Gilbert is owed to Chisholm&#x27;s research, which shows Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who had great respect for the Aboriginal peoples.

==Legacy==
There is a memorial to John Gilbert in St James&#x27; Church, Sydney. John Gilbert&#x27;s memorial at St James&#x27; church is inscribed with the Latin phrase &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori&quot;, which may be translated as &quot;it is sweet and fitting to die for science.&quot;

There is also a memorial to Gilbert at Gilbert&#x27;s Lookout at Taroom.

Various geographic features have been named after him, including:
* Gilbert River, flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria
** Gilberton, on the Gilbert River headwaters 
** Gilbert River Telegraph Station, between Croydon and Georgetown
* Gilbert Range, near the Dawson Valley
* Gilbert&#x27;s Dome, in the Peak Range in Central Queensland

Gilbert&#x27;s potoroo (&quot;Potorous gilbertii&quot; ), a species of mammal, was named after him; as was Gilbert&#x27;s dragon (&quot;Lophognathus gilberti&quot; ), a species of lizard.

On 28 June 1945, to mark the centenary of Gilbert&#x27;s death, wreaths of Australian wildflowers were placed on the marble memorial tablet in St James&#x27; Church in Sydney by representatives of:
* the Royal Australian Historical Society of Sydney
* the Royal Ornithologists&#x27; Union of Sydney
* the Field Naturalists&#x27; Club of Victoria
* the Melbourne Bird Observers&#x27; Club

In the 1980s, the Australian Army searched for Gilbert&#x27;s grave and have marked what they believe to be the probable location.

<doc id="1111039" wikidata="Q568458" url="?curid=1111039" title="2004 Ukrainian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Ukraine on 31 October, 21 November and 26 December 2004. This was the fourth presidential election in Ukraine following independence from the Soviet Union. The last stages of the election were contested between the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko and incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych from the Party of Regions. It was later determined by the Ukrainian Supreme Court that the election was plagued by widespread falsification of the results in favour of Yanukovych.

According to Ukraine&#x27;s electoral law, a two-round system is used to elect the president in which a candidate must win a majority (50% or more) of all ballots cast. The first round of voting was held on 31 October. As no candidate received over 50% of all votes cast, a run-off between the two highest-polling candidates, Yushchenko and Yanukovych, was held on 21 November. According to official Central Election Commission results announced on 23 November, the run-off election was won by Yanukovych. However, the results were challenged by Yushchenko and his supporters, with many western observers claiming that the election was rigged.

The subsequent events led to a political crisis in Ukraine, with widespread peaceful protesters, dubbed the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;, calling for a re-run of the second-round election. On 3 December the Supreme Court of Ukraine declared the results of the 21 November 2004 run-off ballot invalid and ordered a repeat of the second-round ballot.

The re-run ballot was held on 26 December. Viktor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 53% of the vote to Yanukovych&#x27;s 44%. Western observers reported that the re-run ballot was considered overall fairer than the previous ballots.

==Candidates==

The two main contenders in the election were the incumbent Prime Minister and government-supported candidate Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko. Viktor Yanukovych, who was the Prime Minister since 2002, was supported by the outgoing President Leonid Kuchma, as well as by the Russian government and then president Vladimir Putin.

Viktor Yushchenko was portrayed as being more pro-Western and had received support of the European Union states and the United States.

==Conduct==
Although a 75 percent turnout was recorded in the first round, observers reported many irregularities, particularly in the regions where Yushchenko&#x27;s support was seen to be strongest. It was unclear how much of an impact this had on the result.

Observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said the run-off vote &quot;did not meet international standards&quot; and U.S. senior election observer, Senator Richard Lugar, called it a &quot;concerted and forceful program of election day fraud&quot;. Between the two rounds of the election, dramatic increases in turnout were recorded in Yanukovych-supporting regions, while Yushchenko-supporting regions recorded the same turnout or lower than recorded in the first round. This effect was most marked in eastern Ukraine and especially in Yanukovych&#x27;s stronghold of Donetsk Oblast, where a turnout of 98.5% was reportedly claimed—more than 40% up from the first round. In some districts, turnout was recorded to be more than 100%, with one district reported by observers to have recorded a 127% turnout. According to election observers and post-election investigations, pro-Yanukovych activists traveled around the country and voted many times as absentees. Some groups dependent on government assistance, such as students, hospital patients and prisoners, were told to vote for the government candidate.

Many other alleged irregularities were reported, including ballot stuffing, intimidation at voting booths and huge numbers of new voters appearing on the electoral rolls—in Donetsk alone, half a million more voters were registered for the runoff election. Yanukovych won all but one of the regions where significant increases in turnout were noted. It was later determined by the Ukrainian Supreme Court that this was in fact due to widespread falsification of the results.

===International reactions===
The European Union made it clear that they would not recognize the election results. All 25 member countries summoned their ambassadors from Ukraine in order to register a sharp protest against what was seen as election fraud. European Commission President José Manuel Barroso warning of consequences if there is no review of the election. During a meeting between Putin and EU officials in the Hague, the Russian president opposed the EU reaction by saying that he was &quot;deeply convinced that we have no moral right to push a big European state to any kind of massive disorder.&quot;

Among EU member countries, Ukraine&#x27;s western neighbors were most concerned. In Poland, Ukraine&#x27;s largest western neighbor, politicians, the media and ordinary citizens enthusiastically supported Yushchenko and opposed the election fraud. Polish deputies to the European Parliament have called for giving Ukraine the prospect of future EU membership provided the country uniformed to democratic standards. Western EU members are however more reluctant with the idea of Ukrainian membership in the EU, which results in Polish media accusing them of being more interested in the integration process with Turkey and maintaining good relations with Russia.

On 25 November former Ukrainian foreign minister and a close collaborator of Yushchenko, Borys Tarasyuk delivered a speech before the Polish Sejm, urging Poland not to recognize the election result and help solve the political crisis. On the same day former Polish President Lech Wałęsa went to Kyiv to publicly express his support for Viktor Yushchenko. He was later followed by a number of Polish MPs from different parties.

On 26 November the President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski arrived in Kyiv, followed on the same day by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana and the Lithuanian president Valdas Adamkus.

The United States government also decided not to recognize the election, and expressed dissatisfaction with the results; the outgoing US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, unequivocally stated that the result announced could not be accepted as legitimate by the United States. President George W. Bush and various members of Congress made statements disclosing their concern over the legitimacy of the polling. Prominent former Cold War hawk Zbigniew Brzezinski cast the election as opposition to renewed Russian imperialism:

U.S. Senators John McCain and Hillary Clinton jointly wrote a letter nominating Victor Yushchenko along with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination was unsuccessful.

Russia&#x27;s president, Vladimir Putin congratulated Viktor Yanukovych, which was followed shortly afterward by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, on his victory before election results were officially declared. CIS election observers praised the second round of the elections as &quot;legitimate and of a nature that reflected democratic standards&quot;, a view in direct contradiction to other monitoring organizations such as the ENEMO, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine and the IEOM.

Prominent hardliners in Russia cast the election as opposition to renewed Western imperialism. Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov blamed the West for interfering in the situation in Ukraine in the run-up to the 31 October presidential election:

On 28 November Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov gave a speech denouncing the Ukrainian opposition, calling its members a &quot;sabbath of witches&quot; pretending to &quot;represent the whole of the nation.&quot; Russian newspapers have printed increasingly shrill warnings, with the Communist party paper &quot;Pravda&quot; claiming: &quot;NATO troops in Hungary and Poland are preparing to move, and Romanian and Slovakian military units have been put on alert. Ukrainian towns are in their sights.&quot;

Several other CIS countries lined up with Russia in supporting Yanukovych. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko phoned Yanukovych to offer his own congratulations before the results had been officially declared. Kazakhstan&#x27;s President Nursultan Nazarbayev wrote to Yanukovych that &quot;Your victory shows that the Ukrainian people have made a choice in favour of the unity of the nation, of democratic development and economic progress.&quot; The presidents of Kyrgyzstan (Askar Akayev) and of Uzbekistan (Islam Karimov) likewise sent their congratulations. However, later Karimov criticized Russia&#x27;s involvement in the Ukrainian election, saying that &quot;Russia&#x27;s excessive demonstration of its willingness to see a certain outcome in the vote has done more harm than good.&quot;

In contrast, the Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili indicated his support for the supporters of Yushchenko, saying that &quot;What is happening in Ukraine today clearly attests to the importance of Georgia&#x27;s example for the rest of the world.&quot; This was a reference to the Rose Revolution of late 2003. Indeed, Georgians have been highly visible in the demonstrations in Kyiv and the flag of Georgia has been among those on display in the city&#x27;s Independence Square, while Yushchenko himself held up a rose in a seeming reference to the Rose Revolution. Moldova&#x27;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement late November 2004 that stated &quot;basic democratic principles were distorted&quot; and expressed regret that the poll &quot;lacked the objective criteria necessary for their recognition by both the citizens of Ukraine and the international community&quot;.

Armenia and Azerbaijan kept more cautious positions, supporting neither side but stressing the need for Ukrainian unity.

On 2 December, one day before the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a repeat runoff ballot, President Kuchma visited Moscow to discuss the crisis with Russia&#x27;s President Vladimir Putin. Putin supported Kuchma&#x27;s position of desiring wholly new elections, rather than just a repeat of the second round.

==Results==
The first round was held on 31 October. The official results recorded Viktor Yushchenko with 41% and Victor Yanukovych with 40% of the votes cast. As no candidate had secured over 50% of all votes cast (including invalid and blank votes) required for outright victory, a run-off election was scheduled for 21 November.

Following the run-off, the electoral commission declared Yanukovych the winner with 49.42% of all votes cast, while Yushchenko had received 46.69%.

However, the results were challenged by Yushchenko and his supporters. Protests, later known as the Orange Revolution, were held calling for a re-run of the second round. On 3 December the Supreme Court declared the second round results to be invalid and ordered a repeat of the vote. The re-run ballot was held on 26 December, with Yushchenko declared the winner with 53% of the vote to Yanukovych&#x27;s 45%.

Yanukovych conceded defeat on 31 December and resigned as Prime Minister the same day. However, he made a Supreme Court appeal regarding the conduct of the elections. This was rejected on 6 January and on 10 January the Electoral Commission officially declared Yushchenko the winner. On 11 January it published the final election results, clearing the way for Yushchenko to be inaugurated as Ukraine&#x27;s third President. The official ceremonies took place on Sunday, 23 January at about noon, when Yushchenko undertook the constitutional oath was sworn in as president.

==Analysis==
The geographic distribution of the votes showed a clear east–west division of Ukraine, which is rooted deeply in the country&#x27;s history. The western and central parts roughly correspond with the former territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century. They are considered more pro-Western, with the population mostly Ukrainian-speaking and Ukrainian Greek Catholic (Uniate) in the west or Ukrainian Orthodox in the center, and have voted predominantly for Yushchenko. The heavy-industrialized eastern part, including the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, where the links with Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church are much stronger, and which contains many ethnic Russians, is a Yanukovych stronghold.

Many commentators saw the elections as being influenced by outside powers, notably the United States, the European Union and Russia, with the US and EU backing Yushchenko (Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and Senator John McCain all visited Kyiv, in official or private capacities ), and Russian president Vladimir Putin publicly backing Yanukovych. In the media the two candidates were contrasted, with Yushchenko representing both the pro-Western Kyiv residents as well as the rural Ukrainians, whereas Yanukovych representing the Eastern, pro-Russian industrial laborers.

More specifically it was considered that a Yushchenko victory would represent a halt of Ukraine&#x27;s integration with the rest of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and possibly a cancellation of the Common Economic Space between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan that had already been agreed to by the Ukrainian parliament; he would instead be likely to increase attempts at further integration with Europe and a possible membership in the EU and NATO. Viktor Yanukovych had promised to make Russian an official language for Ukraine, as is also the case in other CIS member states Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

==Aftermath==
Despite alleged convincing evidence pointing to high-level involvement in the Leonid Kuchma administration and the Central Election Commission of Ukraine no criminal election fraud charges were filed against any top officials. The prosecutor general did arrest several public figures on charges of election fraud in the first half of 2005, but no high-profile case was brought to court. On 23 September 2005 Yushchenko announced a pact with the Party of Regions in which he promised to look into an amnesty for those convicted of vote rigging during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections. One of the top election-fraud suspects, former CEC head Serhiy Kivalov, is a Party of Regions deputy who heads the Ukrainian Parliament&#x27;s Judiciary Committee.

In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the elections was &quot;taken away&quot;, he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed, commenting: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn&#x27;t want dead bodies from Kyiv to flow down the Dnipro. I didn&#x27;t want to assume power through bloodshed.&quot;

During the 2010 presidential election-campaign, Viktor Yanukovych pledged to prevent electoral fraud during those elections, saying: &quot;We will properly respond to all provocations and attempts to fake election results&quot;.

<doc id="1111047" wikidata="Q6360377" url="?curid=1111047" title="Kanaka Dasa">
<text>Kanaka Dasa (1509–1606) also known as Daasashreshta Kanakadasa (ದಾಸಶ್ರೇಷ್ಠ ಕನಕದಾಸ), was a Haridasa saint and philosopher of Dvaita Vedanta, from present-day Karnataka, India. He was a follower of Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita philosophy and a disciple of Vyasatirtha. He was a composer of Carnatic music, poet, reformer and musician. He is known for his keertanas and ugabhoga, and his compositions in the Kannada language for Carnatic music. Like other Haridasas, he used simple Kannada and native metrical forms for his compositions.

==Birth==
Kanaka Dasa was born into a Kannada kuruba family in Baada village, near Bankapura in Karnataka, and was a warrior at the Bankapura fort. He was taught by Srinivasacharya. As a child, he became an expert in &quot;tarka&quot;, &quot;vyakarana&quot;, and &quot;mimamsa&quot;. Based on one of his compositions, it is interpreted that he was injured in battle and took to the practice of chanting the name of Lord Hari. A beggar appeared to Kanaka Dasa, and Kanaka asked who he was. The beggar responded by saying he was called by him (Kanaka). Kanaka Dasa understood the beggar to be Lord Hari (Krishna) Himself. Lord Hari offered to grant Kanaka Dasa three wishes. Lord Hari first asked if Kanaka wanted treasures. Kanaka Dasa refused, but asked for the following, 1) To be healed of all his injuries, 2) For Lord Hari to appear whenever Kanaka Dasa called for him, and 3) To give darshan in his original form. The Lord granted these wishes. Upon seeing Lord Hari in his original form, Kanaka Dasa was mesmerized. After this incident, Kanaka abandoned his profession as a soldier and devoted himself to composing music, writing literature and explaining philosophy to the people about Sri Hari. His early spiritual works include poems such as &quot;Narasimha Stotra&quot;, &quot;Ramadhyana Mantra&quot;, and &quot;Mohanatarangini&quot;.

===In Udupi===

Kanaka Dasa had a connection with Udupi as he was the disciple of Vyasatirtha. The priests would not let him enter the &quot;mutt&quot;, judging him to be a member of lower caste based on his clothes, even though Vyasatirtha asked them to let Kanaka Dasa into the temple. Then a wall cracked and the idol of Krishna turned towards Kanaka. 

Kanaka Dasa spent a short time in Udupi. He used the phrase, &quot;Kagineleya Adikeshava&quot; as his signature referring to the deity of Kaginele.He is one of great devotee of lord krishna (vishnu).

== Writings ==
===Major works===
* Nalacharithre (ನಳಚರಿತ್ರೆ)
* Haribhakthisara (ಹರಿಭಕ್ತಿಸಾರ)
* Nrisimhastava (ನೃಸಿಂಹಸ್ತವ)
* Ramadhanyacharithe (ರಾಮಧಾನ್ಯಚರಿತೆ), a rare work on class struggle
* Mohanatarangini (ಮೋಹನತರಂಗಿಣಿ)

Kanakadasa wrote about 240 Carnatic music compositions (&quot;kirtane&quot;, &quot;ugabhogas&quot;, &quot;padas&quot;, and philosophical songs) besides five major works. Around 100 songs in Kannada and 60 songs in English are published in popular books.

==Kanakadasa Palace==
During an excavation at Baada, Shiggaon region of Karnataka, the archaeological department found ruins of a fort and a palace which was identified as the era of Kanaka Dasa (who was earlier called Thimmappa Nayaka). The State Government of Karnataka has built a new fort, palace and idols of Kanaka Dasa and his life scenarios commemorating the religious leader.

==In popular culture==

Kannada actor and singer from the Kannada movie industry Dr. Rajkumar played Kanaka Dasa in the 1960 film &quot;Bhakta Kanakadasa &quot;which was well received.

Girish Karnad made a documentary film, &quot;Kanaka-Purandara&quot; (English, 1988), on the two medieval Bhakti poets of Karnataka.

==Legacy==
===Kanaka Guru Peetha===
Kaginele Kanaka Guru Peetha, a mutt established by the Kuruba community, is named in honour of Shri Kanakadasa.

===Kanaka Dasa stamp===
In 1990, the Government of India honored Kanaka Dasa by releasing a postal stamp in his name.

===Kanakadasa Jayanthi===

Kanaka Dasa&#x27;s birthday is celebrated in Karnataka, particularly in the Kuruba community. In 2008, Government of Karnataka decided to commemorate his birthday as a state festival and declared 18 November a state holiday.

<text>Mesalazine, also known as mesalamine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is a medication used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. It is generally used for mildly to moderately severe disease. It is taken by mouth or rectally. The formulations which are taken by mouth appear to be similarly-effective.
Common side-effects include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and fever. Serious side-effects may include pericarditis, liver problems, and kidney problems. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding appears safe. In people with a sulfa allergy certain formulations may result in problems. Mesalazine is an aminosalicylate and anti-inflammatory. It works by direct contact with the intestines.
Mesalazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 239th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

It is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease (effective only in colonic diseases).

In 2022 Germany introduced guidance to use mesalamine to treat acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

==Side-effects==
Most often reported side-effects are gastrointestinal (GI) (but may also include headache), including: nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Very rarely, use of mesalazine has been associated with an exacerbation of the symptoms of colitis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme.

=== Pregnancy ===
There is no data on use in pregnant women, but the drug does cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. The drug should not be used in children under two years of age, people with kidney disease, or people who are allergic to aspirin.

==Chemistry==
Mesalazine is the active moiety of sulfasalazine, which is metabolized to sulfapyridine and mesalazine. It is also the active component of the prodrug balsalazide along with the inert carrier molecule 4-aminobenzoyl-beta-alanine. It is in the category of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) family of medications. It is unclear exactly how it works. Mesalazine is claimed to be a PPAR-γ agonist.

==Mechanism of action==
Exact mechanism of mesalazine is unknown, but is speculated that mesalazine decreases synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotriene, modulating the inflammatory response derived from the cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase pathways. It appears to act locally on colonic mucosa.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Mesalazine is sold under various names including Apriso, Asacol, Asacol HD, Canasa, Delzicol, Fivasa, Lialda, Salofalk, Pentasa, Rowasa, Octasa, and Sfrowasa. In Europe, it is sold under the name Salofalk (rectal suppository).

<text>Ouyang () is a Chinese surname. It is the most common two-character Chinese compound surname, being the only two-character name of the 400 most common Chinese surnames, according to a 2013 study.

==Variations/transliterations==
* Chinese languages : &quot;Ouyang&quot;, &quot;Oyang&quot;, &quot;O Yang&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Yang&quot;, &quot;Owyang&quot;, &quot;Au Yong&quot;, &quot;Auyong&quot;, &quot;Ah Yong&quot;, &quot;Auyang&quot;, &quot;Auyeung&quot;, &quot;Au Yeung&quot;, &quot;Au Yeang&quot;, &quot;Au Yeong&quot;, &quot;Au Ieong&quot;, &quot;Ao Ieong&quot;, &quot;Eoyang&quot;, &quot;Oyong&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Young&quot;, &quot;Auwjong&quot;, &quot;Ojong&quot;, &quot;Owyong&quot;, &quot;Ou Young&quot;, &quot;Ow Yeong&quot;, &quot;Ow Young&quot;
* Vietnamese languages : &quot;An-dương&quot;, &quot;Arang&quot;, &quot;Orang&quot;, &quot;Urang&quot; (安陽, in ancient Annam), &quot;Âu-dương&quot; (Northern), &quot;Âu-giương&quot; (Central), &quot;Âu-dzương&quot; (Southern), &quot;Âu-rương&quot;, &quot;Âu-lương&quot;, &quot;Âu-lang&quot;, &quot;Âu-giang&quot;
* Korean : 구양 (&quot;Guyang&quot;)
* Japanese : (おうよう, &quot;Ōyō&quot;)

==History==
The Song dynasty historian Ouyang Xiu traced the Ouyang surname to Ti (, pinyin: Tí), a prince of Yue, the second son of King Wujiang (). After his state was extinguished by the state of Chu, Ti and his family lived in the south side of the Mount Ouyu (, currently called Mount Sheng in Huzhou, Zhejiang). In Classical Chinese, the south side of a mountain or the north bank of a river is called Yang (), thus the Ti family was called Ouyang. He was called Marquis of Ouyang Village (). Traditionally, Ti&#x27;s ancestry can be traced through his father Wujiang, the King of Yue, to the semi-legendary Yu the Great ().

According to a 2013 study, Ouyang was the 169th most common name in China, being shared by around 910000 people or 0.068% of the total population, with the province with the most people with the name being Hunan.
===Geographical origins===
In terms of distribution Ouyangs have mostly been confined to southern China, especially the areas of southern Jiangxi, central Hubei and eastern Henan, with smaller pockets in Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan and Guangxi.

===Notable clans===
The most prominent of the Ouyang clans historically was undoubtedly that of Yongfeng in Jiangxi, which produced a number of scholars who reached prominence in the imperial bureaucracy. Genealogical lineages and family trees have been established for a number of Ouyang clans around China, showing migration patterns from the Song to the Qing dynasty.

In Vietnam, this clan was often shortcut as Âu (歐), Dương (阳) or Dương/Giàng (陽).

<text>A post town is a required part of all postal addresses in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and a basic unit of the postal delivery system. Including the correct post town in the address increases the chance of a letter or parcel being delivered on time. Post towns in general originated as the location of delivery offices. , their main function is to distinguish between localities or street names in addresses not including a postcode.

==Organisation==
There are approximately 1,500 post towns which are organised by Royal Mail subject to its policy only to impose changes where it has a proven, economic and practical benefit to the organisation, covering its own cost. Each post town usually corresponds to one or more postal districts (the &quot;outward&quot; part of the postcode, before the space); therefore, each post town can cover an area comprising many towns, urban districts and villages. Post towns rarely correspond exactly to administrative boundaries and their associated physical features. As such they often group a small minority of neighbourhoods, streets or houses together with a main settlement in a different county, area of local government or administration (including healthcare trust), constituency, European statistical region and/or traditional parish. This was a main reason why postal counties were abolished (but not prohibited) in 1996.

In some places several post towns cover a single postal district (with each post town corresponding to one or more of its postcode sectors). There are anomalies where post towns and postcode sectors have a more unusual co-relation. For example, the postcode sector EH14 5 is split between three post towns: Juniper Green, Currie and Balerno. Its other postcode sectors are generally limited to one of these.

==Usage==
Royal Mail states that the post town must be included on all items and should be clearly written in capitals.

:1 Vallance Road
:LONDON
:E2 1AA

The use of postcodes means that it is no longer necessary to include the former postal county in a postal address. Some post towns, known as special post towns, never required the inclusion of a postal county, either because the town was large or because it gave its name to the county.

===Locality===

In most places, additional locality information such as a village or suburb name is optionally added above the post town, giving a more specific location: the two largest &quot;post town&quot; cities named, for example, have many roads of the same name in different localities and the additional locality information is therefore essential if the postcode is wrongly recorded or unknown.

Where this is a disambiguating feature, Royal Mail terms this the &quot;dependent locality&quot;. For a limited number of addresses a &quot;double dependent locality&quot; line is also required, preceding the dependent locality line: some examples include &quot;Churwell, Morley, Leeds&quot; and &quot;Marton, Sinnington, York&quot;.

Locality information other than the post town is not always part of the official postal address. In particular, within the London post town, each postcode district name (which can conflict with administrative boundaries, see above) corresponds to a numbered postcode district and is therefore not required in the postal address whenever the postcode is used. For example, &quot;Bethnal Green&quot; is the name of the &quot;E2&quot; postcode district and is optional in the following address:

:1 Vallance Road
:Bethnal Green
:LONDON
:E2 1AA

If no valid postcode is provided, or if the sorting machine rejects the letter, the use of optional locality or county information may assist manual sorting. In the absence of a full valid postcode, locality often prevents ambiguity where there is more than one street with the same name covered by a post town or postcode district, or where post towns in different counties have the same name.

===Via===

Traditionally only, where a place such as a village was served by a post town entirely distinct from its location, the word &quot;Via&quot; or &quot;Near&quot; (&quot;Nr.&quot;) was added before the post town. For example:

:1 High Street
:Cuffley
:Via Potters Bar
:EN6 1AA

However, the Royal Mail discourages this usage because their optical character recognition technology and Mailsort lookup tables check for the post town at the beginning of a line if the postcode is missing, unreadable or incorrect. Additionally, &quot;Near&quot; and &quot;Nr.&quot; can be confused with &quot;North&quot;.

<doc id="1111060" wikidata="Q1040789" url="?curid=1111060" title="Repeater (album)">
<text>Repeater is the full-length debut studio album by the American post-hardcore band Fugazi. It was released on April 19, 1990, as &quot;Repeater&quot; on LP, and in May 1990 on CD bundled with the &quot;3 Songs&quot; EP as Repeater + 3 Songs. It was recorded at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia, and produced and engineered by Don Zientara and Ted Niceley.

&quot;Repeater&quot; is often regarded as a definitive album for the band and a landmark of rock music. It has been described as an &quot;angrier American update of Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;Solid Gold&quot;.&quot; It has also been noted for its complex interplay of guitar and rhythm section. It is included in the book &quot;1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Background==
By 1989, Fugazi had made the transition into jamming on and writing new material as a band as opposed to playing songs composed solely by singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye. After the completion of several lengthy U.S. and European tours, they began to work on new material as well as refining songs that they had already been performing live, such as &quot;Merchandise&quot; and &quot;Turnover&quot; - the latter of which was originally titled &quot;NSA&quot; in its original form - featuring MacKaye on vocals.

The band once again chose to work with both Don Zientara and Ted Niceley as they had previously, and entered Inner Ear Studios in July 1989 to begin the recording process. The group was only able to record with Niceley present between the hours of 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. because Niceley was splitting his time between the studio and culinary school. Recording for the album was completed in September 1989.

The album cover was based on a photo by Jim Saah.

The album&#x27;s subject matter addresses a wide variety of themes such as greed, violence, sexuality, privacy, drug abuse and death. MacKaye told &quot;Guitar World&quot; that the album title &quot;is loaded on so many levels. It&#x27;s actually about how things in life repeat over and over. But the title is also a rather obscure nod to The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;. A record revolves and it also repeats. A revolver is also a gun, and so is a repeater. The title track is about kids repeatedly shooting each other and references the crack cocaine-related violence in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s.&quot;

==Release and reception==

Released on April 19, 1990, through Dischord Records, &quot;Repeater&quot; did not initially reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily, performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000+ capacity venues all over the world.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that the band &quot;mixes the raw independence of Black Flag and the political insistence of Gang of Four&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; concluded that &quot;Repeater&quot; &quot;captures much of the band&#x27;s passion and immediacy: the steel-spring rhythms of drummer Brendan Canty and bassist Joe Lally, the weaving, parrying and intersecting guitars and voices of Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, and the clear-eyed moral vision of its lyrics.&quot;

While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided that Dischord was distributing their records well enough and refused the offers. According to Alan O&#x27;Connor in his 2008 book &quot;Punk Record Labels and the Struggle for Autonomy: The Emergence of DIY&quot;, &quot;Repeater&quot; went on to sell 500,000 copies (based on an interview with Dischord Records).

==Legacy==

=== Influence ===
&quot;Repeater&quot; featured an alternative rock sound that predated significant releases such as Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;, which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream. Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine was influenced by the album, as were Steve Holmes of American Football and Metz. Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan named it one of his favorite records of all time.

The track &quot;Merchandise&quot; has been covered by Face to Face (on their album &quot;Standards &amp; Practices&quot;), Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Dogstar. &quot;Blueprint&quot; was covered by Gogol Bordello live, Ben Lee and Tim Timebomb. The track was quoted by the Knife on the track &quot;Raging Lung&quot; off of &quot;Shaking the Habitual&quot;. It has also been sampled by Emynd for Stranger Day&#x27;s track &quot;Not Playin&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Styrofoam&quot; has been covered by Stereotyperider. &quot;Shut the Door&quot; has been covered by Boy Eats Drum Machine.

<text>Spjelkavik is a borough in the town of Ålesund in Ålesund Municipality, Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is also called &quot;Vika&quot; by many locals. Spjelkavik is located on the western end of the island of Uksenøya, at the intersection of the European route E39 and European route E136 highways, just west of the lake Brusdalsvatnet. The villages of Breivika, Myrland, and Løvika lie to the south of Spjelkavik. The population of Spjelkavik is approximately 11,000 inhabitants and is the second largest part of the city. It is also one of areas that grows the quickest in Ålesund. The distance from the city center of Ålesund to Spjelkavik is about .

Spjelkavik has one of Norway&#x27;s biggest malls (in the area called &quot;Moa&quot;) and the Spjelkavik branch of the Ålesund public library. Moa was once considered as a potential place for the city&#x27;s airport, but final plans were made and the airport was built on the nearby island of Vigra instead. Today this area is booming due to not only shopping, but also a central point for logistic connections. Spjelkavik Church is located here.

<text>Lars Saabye Christensen (born 21 September 1953 in Oslo) is a Norwegian / Danish author.

Saabye Christensen was raised in the Skillebekk neighbourhood of Oslo, but lived for many years in Sortland Municipality in northern Norway; both places play a major role in his work. He lives in Blindern, the university district of Oslo.

He is half Danish and holds Danish and Norwegian citizenship.

==Career==
Saabye Christensen studied literature, Norwegian, art history and the history of ideas at university. He made his début in 1976 with a collection of poems entitled &quot;Historien om Gly&quot;, which won Tarjei Vesaas&#x27; debutantpris for that year&#x27;s best Norwegian literary début, but he had published a poem collection, titled &quot;Grønt lys&quot; (Green light), when he was 19 years old, and had also published many poems in an underground literary publication called &quot;Dikt og Datt&quot;.

He has written numerous poems and plays, and several film scripts, but is best known as a novelist. His first novel was published the year after &quot;Historien om Gly&quot; and titled &quot;Amatøren&quot; (The Amateur). Among his most noted works are the novels &quot;Beatles&quot; (1984) (for which he won the Cappelen Prize) and &quot;Halvbroren&quot; (The Half Brother, 2001) (for which he won the Brage Prize, two other Norwegian literary awards, and The Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize, and which was shortlisted for the 2005 International Dublin Literary Award). Other notable books by Saabye Christensen are &quot;Herman&quot;, &quot;Gutten Som Ville Være En Av Gutta&quot;, &quot;Maskeblomstfamilien&quot; and &quot;Modellen&quot;. Between 2017 and 2019, he released a trilogy titled &quot;Byens spor&quot; (The Traces of a City), in which all three books were met with critical acclaim, while simultaneously being treated for a spinal disc herniation and bone marrow cancer. 

Since 1993 he has issued 4 recordings of his poetry as a member of the band Norsk Utflukt: &quot;Med lyset på&quot; (1993), &quot;Diger og gul&quot; (1997), &quot;Det blå arret&quot; (2002) and &quot;Tida som går&quot; (2004).
On 24 October 2006, he was made a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. In April 2008, he was made a &quot;Chevalier dans L’ordre des Arts et Lettres&quot; (Knight of the Order of Arts and Literature) by the French Government. In 2018, he was awarded an honorary Amanda award for his contribution to Norwegian culture. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature.

His novel &quot;Sluk&quot; was adapted by Bent Hamer for the 2021 film &quot;The Middle Man&quot;.

<text>The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) was a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Twin satellites took detailed measurements of Earth&#x27;s gravity field anomalies from its launch in March 2002 to the end of its science mission in October 2017. The two satellites were sometimes called Tom and Jerry, a nod to the famous cartoon. The GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) is a continuation of the mission on near-identical hardware, launched in May 2018. On March 19, 2024, NASA announced that the successor to GRACE-FO would be Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-Continuity (GRACE-C), to be launched in or after 2028.

By measuring gravity anomalies, GRACE showed how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time. Data from the GRACE satellites is an important tool for studying Earth&#x27;s ocean, geology, and climate. GRACE was a collaborative endeavor involving the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the German Aerospace Center and Germany&#x27;s National Research Center for Geosciences, Potsdam. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was responsible for the overall mission management under the NASA ESSP (Earth System Science Pathfinder) program.

The principal investigator is Byron Tapley of the University of Texas Center for Space Research, and the co-principal investigator is Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam.

The two GRACE satellites, GRACE-1 and GRACE-2, were launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia, on a Rockot (SS-19 + Briz upper stage) launch vehicle on 17 March 2002. The spacecraft were launched to an initial altitude of approximately 500 km at a near-polar inclination of 89°. During normal operations, the satellites were separated by 220 km along their orbit track. This system was able to gather global coverage every 30 days. GRACE far exceeded its 5-year design lifespan, operating for 15 years until the decommissioning of GRACE-2 on 27 October 2017. Its successor, GRACE-FO, was successfully launched on 22 May 2018.

In 2019, a glacier in West Antarctica was named after the GRACE mission.

== Discoveries and applications ==
The monthly gravity anomalies maps generated by GRACE are up to 1,000 times more accurate than previous maps, substantially improving the accuracy of many techniques used by oceanographers, hydrologists, glaciologists, geologists and other scientists to study phenomena that influence climate.

From the thinning of ice sheets to the flow of water through aquifers and the slow currents of magma inside Earth, mass measurements provided by GRACE help scientists better understand these important natural processes.

=== Oceanography, hydrology, and ice sheets ===
GRACE chiefly detected changes in the distribution of water across the planet. Scientists use GRACE data to estimate ocean bottom pressure (the combined weight of the ocean waters and atmosphere), which is as important to oceanographers as atmospheric pressure is to meteorologists. For example, measuring ocean pressure gradients allows scientists to estimate monthly changes in deep ocean currents. The limited resolution of GRACE is acceptable in this research because large ocean currents can also be estimated and verified by an ocean buoy network. Scientists have also detailed improved methods for using GRACE data to describe Earth&#x27;s gravity field. GRACE data are critical in helping to determine the cause of sea level rise, whether it is the result of mass being added to the ocean – from melting glaciers, for example – or from thermal expansion of warming water or changes in salinity. High-resolution static gravity fields estimated from GRACE data have helped improve the understanding of global ocean circulation. The hills and valleys in the ocean&#x27;s surface (ocean surface topography) are due to currents and variations in Earth&#x27;s gravity field. GRACE enables separation of those two effects to better measure ocean currents and their effect on climate.

GRACE data have provided a record of mass loss within the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland has been found to lose of ice per year between 2003 and 2013, while Antarctica has lost per year in the same period. These equate to a total of 0.9 mm/yr of sea level rise. Increases in ocean heat content resulting from Earth&#x27;s Energy Imbalance of about 0.8 W/m2 were similarly found spanning 2002 thru 2019. 

GRACE data have also provided insights into regional hydrology inaccessible to other forms of remote sensing: for example, groundwater depletion in India and California. The annual hydrology of the Amazon basin provides an especially strong signal when viewed by GRACE. A University of California, Irvine-led study published in &quot;Water Resources Research&quot; on 16 June 2015 used GRACE data between 2003 and 2013 to conclude that 21 of the world&#x27;s 37 largest aquifers &quot;have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted&quot; and thirteen of them are &quot;considered significantly distressed.&quot; The most over-stressed is the Arabian Aquifer System, upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.

=== Geophysics ===
GRACE also detects changes in the gravity field due to geophysical processes. Glacial isostatic adjustment—the slow rise of land masses once depressed by the weight of ice sheets from the last ice age—is chief among these signals. GIA signals appear as secular trends in gravity field measurements and must be removed to accurately estimate changes in water and ice mass in a region. GRACE is also sensitive to permanent changes in the gravity field due to earthquakes. For instance, GRACE data have been used to analyze the shifts in the Earth&#x27;s crust caused by the earthquake that created the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

In 2006, a team of researchers led by Ralph von Frese and Laramie Potts used GRACE data to discover the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica, which was probably formed about 250 million years ago.
=== Geodesy ===
Data from GRACE has improved the current Earth gravitational field model, leading to improvements in the field of geodesy. This improved model has allowed for corrections in the equipotential surface which land elevations are referenced from. This more accurate reference surface allows for more accurate coordinates of latitude and longitude and for less error in the calculation of geodetic satellite orbits.

=== Other signals ===
GRACE is sensitive to regional variations in the mass of the atmosphere and high-frequency variation in ocean bottom pressure. These variations are well understood and are removed from monthly gravity estimates using forecast models to prevent aliasing. Nonetheless, errors in these models do influence GRACE solutions.

GRACE data also contribute to fundamental physics. They have been used to re-analyze data obtained from the LAGEOS experiment to try to measure the relativistic frame-dragging effect.

== Spacecraft ==

The spacecraft were manufactured by Astrium of Germany, using its &quot;Flexbus&quot; platform. The microwave RF systems, and attitude determination and control system algorithms were provided by Space Systems/Loral. The star cameras used to measure the spacecraft attitude were provided by Technical University of Denmark. The instrument computer along with a highly precise BlackJack GPS receiver and digital signal processing system was provided by JPL in Pasadena. The highly precise accelerometer that is needed to separate atmospheric and solar radiation pressure effects from the gravitation data was manufactured by ONERA.

=== Measurement principle ===

GRACE&#x27;s key measurement, satellite gravimetry, is not derived from electromagnetic waves. Instead, the mission uses a microwave ranging system to accurately measure changes in the speed and distance between two identical spacecraft flying in a polar orbit about apart, above Earth. The ranging system is sensitive enough to detect separation changes as small as 10 micrometers (approximately one-tenth the width of a human hair) over a distance of 220 kilometers. As the twin GRACE satellites circle the globe 15 times a day, they sense minute variations in Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull. When the first satellite passes over a region of slightly stronger gravity, a gravity anomaly, it is pulled slightly ahead of the trailing satellite. This causes the distance between the satellites to increase. The first spacecraft then passes the anomaly, and slows down again; meanwhile the following spacecraft accelerates, then decelerates over the same point. By measuring the constantly changing distance between the two satellites and combining that data with precise positioning measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments, scientists can construct a detailed map of Earth&#x27;s gravity anomalies.

=== Instruments ===

The two satellites (nicknamed &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Jerry&quot;) constantly maintain a two-way, K-band microwave-ranging link between them. Fine distance measurements are made by comparing frequency shifts of the link. This is made possible due to the onboard Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO) which produces the frequencies for the K-band ranging system. The micrometer-sensitivity of this measurement requires accordingly precise measurements of each spacecraft&#x27;s position, motion, and orientation to be useful. To remove the effect of external, non-gravitational forces (e.g., drag, solar radiation pressure), the vehicles use sensitive Super STAR electrostatic accelerometers located near their respective centers of mass. GPS receivers are used to establish the precise positions of each satellite along the baseline between the satellites. The satellites use star cameras and magnetometers to establish attitude. The GRACE vehicles also have optical corner reflectors to enable laser ranging from ground stations using the Center of Mass Trim Assembly (MTA) which ensures the center of mass is modified throughout the flight accordingly.

=== Data products ===

CSR, GFZ, and JPL process observations and ancillary data downloaded from GRACE to produce monthly geopotential models of Earth. These models are distributed as spherical harmonic coefficients with a maximum degree of 60. Degree 90 products are also available. These products have a typical latency of 1–2 months. These geopotential coefficients may be used to compute geoid height, gravity anomalies, and changes in the distribution of mass on Earth&#x27;s surface. Gridded products estimating changes in mass in units of liquid water equivalent thickness are available at JPL&#x27;s GRACE Tellus website.

== End of mission ==

Following an age-related battery issue on GRACE-2 in September 2017, it became apparent that GRACE-2&#x27;s remaining battery capacity would not be sufficient to operate. Therefore, it was decided in mid-October to decommission the GRACE-2 satellite and end GRACE&#x27;s science mission. Atmospheric reentry of GRACE-2 occurred on 24 December 2017 at approximately 00:16 UTC; atmospheric reentry of GRACE-1 took place on 10 March 2018 around 06:09 UTC.

== GRACE Follow-On ==
The GRACE-FO mission, a collaboration between NASA and GFZ, was launched on 22 May 2018 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg AFB, California, sharing the launch with five Iridium NEXT satellites. During in-orbit checks, an anomaly was discovered in the primary system component of the microwave instrument (MWI), and the system was temporarily powered down on 19 July 2018. After a full investigation by an anomaly response team at JPL, the backup system in the MWI was powered up on 19 October 2018 and GRACE-FO resumed its in-orbit checks. GRACE-FO entered the science phase of its mission on 28 January 2019.

The orbit and design of GRACE-FO is very similar to its predecessor. GRACE-FO employs the same two-way microwave-ranging link as GRACE, which will allow for similar inter-satellite ranging precision. In addition, GRACE-FO employs laser-ranging interferometry (LRI) as a technological experiment in preparation for future satellites. The LRI allows for more accurate inter-satellite ranging due to the shorter wavelength of light, and additionally allows the angle between the two spacecraft to be measured as well as their separation via differential wavefront sensing (DWS). Using the LRI, scientists have improved the precision of the separation distance measurements by a factor of more than 20 relative to the GRACE mission. Each laser on the LRI has about the same power as four laser pointers. These lasers must be detected by a spacecraft about away. This laser approach will generate much more accurate measurements than the previous GRACE satellite mission.

The GRACE-FO satellites obtain electricity from gallium arsenide solar cell array panels covering the outside of each satellite.

GRACE-FO will continue to monitor Earth&#x27;s gravity and climate. The mission will track gravitational changes in global sea levels, glaciers, and ice sheets, as well as large lake and river water levels, and soil moisture. In addition, each of the satellites will use GPS antennas to create at least 200 profiles per day of atmospheric temperature distribution and water vapor content, a first for the GRACE mission.

GRACE-FO has a design life of 5 years.

<text>The [[Nokia]] M1122 is a 4-port ADSL router that is known to have been sold in Europe and New Zealand in 2000–2002. In addition to its main task, it can operate as a Ethernet hub in a local area network.

The M1122 had a sister model, Nokia MW1122, with Wireless LAN capabilities. They were the last ADSL routers manufactured by Nokia. In the last half of 2002 the model was discontinued along with the rest of Nokia&#x27;s ADSL router operations.

==Technical specifications==

* ANSI T1.413 Issue 2 (chipset by Alcatel)
* can be used either in routed or bridged mode
* connectors: ADSL line cord to the phone plug, power cord, CLI port, power switch and four 10BASE-T ports
* LEDs: power, status, ADSL line and 4*Ethernet
* dimensions: width 22.5 cm, height 6.5 cm, depth 23 cm, weight 1 kg
* Internal power supply: 100 - 240 V

==Administration interface==

There are two ways to do maintenance work in M1122. The preferred way to do that is via a Web interface. Users can, however, also choose to enter commands in a text-based console that can be reached both through telnet and with a special CLI cable whose other end is attached to the computer&#x27;s COM port. The router has a limitation, that when bridged mode is turned on, the CLI cable is the only way to maintain it.

The CLI connector is an 8P8C (RJ-45) female modular connector with a pinout similar to EIA/TIA - 561 but crosslinked, swapping the DTE and DCE roles.

<doc id="1111093" wikidata="Q4861362" url="?curid=1111093" title="Barnaby Joyce">
<text>Barnaby Thomas Gerard Joyce (born 17 April 1967) is an Australian politician who was the leader of the National Party of Australia from 2016 to 2018 and again from 2021 to 2022. Joyce was the 17th deputy prime minister of Australia during both his leadership tenures under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull from 2016 to 2018 and Prime Minister Scott Morrison from 2021 to 2022.

Joyce was born in Tamworth, New South Wales, and graduated from the University of New England. In 1999 he set up an accountancy practice in St George, Queensland. Joyce was elected to the Australian Senate at the 2004 federal election, taking office in 2005. He became the National Party&#x27;s Senate leader in 2008. At the 2013 election, he transferred to the House of Representatives, winning the rural seat of New England in New South Wales.

During 2013 Joyce replaced Nigel Scullion as deputy leader of the National Party. He succeeded Warren Truss as party leader and deputy prime minister in 2016. In the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Joyce served as Minister for Agriculture (2013–2015), Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources (2015–2017), Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (2017) and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport (2017–2018).

During the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, Joyce was confirmed to be a dual citizen of New Zealand, which is forbidden under Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. On 27 October 2017, the High Court of Australia ruled that he had been ineligible to be a candidate for the House of Representatives at the time of the 2016 election. Joyce re-entered parliament in December 2017 after winning the New England by-election with a large swing against low-profile opposition. In February 2018, he resigned his ministerial and leadership roles after acknowledging that he was in a relationship and expecting a child with a former staffer. He was succeeded by Michael McCormack, but remained in the party as a backbencher. In June 2021, Joyce defeated McCormack in a leadership spill to return as deputy prime minister. Following the Liberal–National coalition&#x27;s loss at the 2022 federal election, Joyce was replaced by David Littleproud as leader of the National Party, after a leadership challenge and is now the Shadow Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs.

==Early life and career==
Joyce was born in Tamworth, New South Wales, and raised as one of six children on a sheep and cattle property about 60 kilometres north-east at Danglemah near Woolbrook. Joyce is the son of Marie () and James Joyce, who were farmers. His father, a World War II veteran, was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia in 1947. Joyce&#x27;s paternal grandfather John P. Joyce was a career soldier who participated in the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I, including the landing at Anzac Cove.

Joyce attended Woolbrook Public School, boarded at Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview in Sydney, and graduated from the University of New England (UNE) Armidale with a Bachelor of Financial Administration in 1989. Joyce met Natalie Abberfield at UNE. They married in 1993. After graduating, Joyce moved around northern New South Wales and Queensland as a farm worker, nightclub bouncer, and banker. From 1991 to 2005, Joyce worked in the accounting profession, and founded his own accountancy firm &quot;Barnaby Joyce &amp; Co.&quot; in St George, Queensland in 1999. He is a fellow of CPA Australia. From 1996 to 2001, Joyce served in the Royal Queensland Regiment of the Australian Army Reserve.

==Senator for Queensland (2005–2013)==

In the 2004 Australian federal election, Joyce was elected to the Senate representing Queensland and the National Party. His term ran from 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2011. He was re-elected at the 2010 election as a member of the Liberal National Party, which was formed by a merger of the Queensland divisions of the two non-Labor parties.

Before taking his seat in July 2005, Joyce said that the government should not take his support for granted. As a senator, he crossed the floor nineteen times during the term of the Howard government. Joyce initially expressed misgivings about the government&#x27;s proposed sale of Telstra, the partially state-owned telecommunications company; nevertheless, Joyce voted in favour of the sale a few months later in September 2005. This led the Labor Party to label Joyce &quot;Backdown Barney&quot; and &quot;Barnaby Rubble&quot; in an acrimonious parliamentary debate. As the Telstra Sale Legislation had been pursued by the lower house in prior parliamentary sessions with no assistance package for regional Australia, Joyce was later credited with holding out until the multibillion-dollar assistance package was negotiated and delivered.

Joyce opposed the free provision of the Gardasil vaccine.

In May 2006, after a one-month visit to Antarctica as a member of the External Territories Committee, Joyce promoted mining there, banned under the Antarctic Treaty, and stated that other nations did not recognise Australia&#x27;s 42 per cent claim over Antarctica. The proposal was roundly condemned by Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell, Labor Opposition spokesman Anthony Albanese and others.

===Crossing the floor===
As a Senator, Joyce used the threat of crossing the floor to extract concessions from his own government on various issues, most notably in relation to the sale of Telstra. He crossed the floor 28 times and there was a perception that he was a &quot;maverick&quot; and someone not beholden to the Liberals. The &quot;They Vote For You&quot; website, which monitors the voting patterns of federal politicians, records that Joyce has &quot;rebelled&quot; against the party whip in 1.1% of divisions.
The following table lists the legislation on which Joyce has crossed the floor, but does not include motions. 
===Leader of the Nationals in the Senate===

In September 2008, after replacing Nigel Scullion as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Joyce stated that his party in the upper house would no longer necessarily vote with their Liberal counterparts in the upper house, which opened up another possible avenue for the Labor government to pass legislation. Joyce gained the majority support of the five Nationals (including one Country Liberal Party) senators through Fiona Nash and John Williams. The takeover was not expected nor revealed to the party until after it took place. Joyce remained leader of his party despite the Queensland divisions of the Liberal and National parties merging into the Liberal National Party of Queensland in July 2008.

In 2009, when Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull decided that the Coalition would support the Rudd government&#x27;s emissions trading scheme (ETS), Joyce as Nationals Senate leader helped trigger the rebellion within Coalition ranks against it.

The issue with the ETS would lead to Turnbull being replaced as Liberal leader by Tony Abbott.

Abbott then appointed Joyce as Shadow Finance Minister.

In February 2010, Joyce as Shadow Finance Minister declared that Australia was &quot;going to hock to our eyeballs to people overseas&quot; and was &quot;getting to a point where we can&#x27;t repay it&quot;. This led to a response from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, that he had &quot;yet to meet a finance minister [sic] who has ever mused any possibility about debt default of his own country&quot; and that there were &quot;few things less likely than Australia defaulting on its sovereign debt&quot;.

Senator Joyce&#x27;s time as Shadow Finance Minister was fraught with difficulties which also infamously saw him confusing trillions with billions in his first appearance as Shadow Finance Minister at the National Press Club and became the source of ridicule by the Government.

There were calls from within the Coalition that Joyce be removed from the Finance portfolio as it was a distraction in their attacks on the Government which was having its own problems with the insulation scheme.

Joyce lasted as Shadow Finance Minister for three months from December 2009 to March 2010 when Abbott, in a reshuffle, moved him to Regional Development, Infrastructure and Water.

In the 2010 election Joyce was re-elected to parliament on the LNP ticket with Senators George Brandis and Brett Mason, and Joyce got more below the line votes than above the line votes. He was reappointed to the Shadow Ministry with his portfolio renamed as Regional Development, Local Government and Water as well as remaining as leader of the Nationals in the Senate.

==House of Representatives==
In April 2013 Joyce won the Nationals preselection for the House of Representatives seat of New England in New South Wales for the September 2013 election. The seat was held on a margin of 21.52% by independent politician Tony Windsor, who had decided to retire. Independent state parliamentarian Richard Torbay had been preselected as National candidate in August 2012, but was pushed out due to concerns about his ownership of several Centrelink buildings and reports that he received secret donations from Labor interests to run against National candidates.

Joyce had expressed interest in transferring to the lower house for some time. He had initially mulled running in Maranoa, which included his home in St George, but this was brought undone when that seat&#x27;s longtime member, Bruce Scott, refused to stand aside in his favour. When Torbay&#x27;s candidacy imploded, the state Nationals felt chagrin at Joyce&#x27;s renewed interest, even though he had been born in Tamworth and had spent much of his youth on both sides of the Tweed. They initially floated NSW Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner as a replacement for Torbay. Ultimately, however, Joyce faced little opposition in the preselection contest. He resigned from the Senate on 8 August 2013, and Barry O&#x27;Sullivan was selected to replace him in the Senate.

Joyce won the seat of New England with a margin of 21 points. He was the first person to win back both a Senate seat and a House of Representatives seat previously lost by the Coalition. The Nationals had held New England without interruption from 1922 until Windsor won the seat in 2001, and had been heavily tipped to regain it with Windsor&#x27;s retirement. During Windsor&#x27;s tenure, most calculations of &quot;traditional&quot; two-party matchups between the Nationals and Labor had shown it as a comfortably safe National seat. Joyce is one of only a handful of people to have represented multiple states in parliament, and the only person to have represented one state in the Senate and a different state in the House of Representatives.

By Windsor&#x27;s account, Joyce revealed that if Windsor had contested the seat, rather than retired, Prime Minister Abbott&#x27;s office was ready to finance a range of projects in the New England to aid Joyce&#x27;s campaign (including $50 million for Armidale hospital); however, once there was no competition, all but $5 million was reallocated to other electorates.

Following the 2013 election, Joyce was elected deputy leader of the Nationals. On 18 September 2013, Joyce was sworn in as Minister for Agriculture. On 21 September 2015, this portfolio was expanded to include Water Resources in the First Turnbull Ministry.

In September 2015 Joyce gained international attention after warning actor Johnny Depp that his two pet dogs would be euthanised if not removed from Australia after being imported illegally.

At the 2016 election Joyce faced a stiff challenge from Tony Windsor, who came out of retirement to contest. Seat-level polling in the seat of New England found Joyce and Windsor neck and neck, however Joyce won with a majority on the primary vote, enough to retain the seat without the need for preferences.

===Election as Nationals leader===

On 11 February 2016 Leader of the National Party, Warren Truss announced his intended retirement and Barnaby Joyce was elected unopposed as his replacement, with Fiona Nash as his deputy. Joyce was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia on 18 February 2016. On 7 December 2017, Bridget McKenzie replaced Nash as deputy leader of the Nationals.

===Constitutional eligibility===
On 14 August 2017 Joyce became embroiled in the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, announcing to the House of Representatives that he had received advice from the New Zealand High Commission that he could possibly hold New Zealand citizenship by descent from his father. Joyce asked the government to have him referred to the High Court in the Court of Disputed Returns for consideration and clarification of his eligibility alongside that of senators Ludlam, Waters, Canavan and Roberts. Later in the day, the New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs and the Crown Law Office confirmed that Joyce was indeed a New Zealand citizen. He quickly renounced his New Zealand citizenship. On 27 October 2017, the High Court ruled that Joyce had been ineligible to be a candidate for the House of Representatives at the time of the 2016 election, since he had been a dual citizen at that time, and that his election was therefore invalid. The ruling cast doubt on the validity of ministerial decisions made after August 2017. Following the crisis, Joyce was humorously nominated as the 2018 New Zealander of the Year, receiving the second highest number of votes.

On 2 December 2017 Joyce won the ensuing New England by-election with a healthy two-party swing of 7.5 percent, in the process winning almost two-thirds of the primary vote. He was sworn back into the House four days later, and on the same day was reappointed as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. Prime Minister Turnbull had taken on that portfolio himself after Joyce was forced out of Parliament for the first time. On 20 December 2017, in a rearrangement of the Second Turnbull Ministry, Joyce was appointed as the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.

During the by-election for New England, Gina Rinehart awarded Joyce the first &quot;National Agricultural and Related Industries prize&quot;, worth $40,000. This was criticised by Labor, and Joyce&#x27;s office later said that he would &quot;politely decline&quot; the money.

=== Affair ===

On 7 December 2017 Joyce announced that he had separated from his wife. On 6 February 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that he was expecting a child with his former communications staffer Vikki Campion. Richard Di Natale of the Greens called on Joyce to resign for &quot;clearly breaching the standards required of ministers&quot;. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly called for Joyce to &quot;consider his own position.&quot; This was as much as Turnbull could do under the Coalition agreement, which stipulates that the leader of the Nationals automatically becomes Deputy Prime Minister during periods of Coalition government. Turnbull could not have sacked Joyce unless he was deposed in a National leadership spill. However, Turnbull forced Joyce to go on a week of personal leave instead of acting as prime minister while Turnbull visited the United States. He also announced that the parliamentary code of conduct would be reworded to forbid sexual relationships between ministers and their staff. On 21 February, Turnbull ordered an investigation into whether Joyce had breached the ministerial code of conduct. As of May 2018, the investigation into Joyce&#x27;s travel expenses was ongoing. In February 2018, Turnbull&#x27;s office relied on a technicality in stating that Joyce had not breached the ministerial code of conduct when his lover was employed by fellow MPs, arguing Vikki Campion could not be considered the Deputy Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;partner&quot; at the time.

=== Alleged sexual harassment and resignation ===

The Nationals received a formal complaint alleging that Joyce had sexually harassed a Western Australian woman. Joyce&#x27;s spokesman called the complaint &quot;spurious and defamatory.&quot; On 23 February, Joyce announced that he would formally resign on 26 February as leader of the National Party, step down from his ministerial portfolios and move to the backbench. On resignation, Joyce lost his Deputy Prime Minister&#x27;s and ministerial salaries of $416,000 a year, only to receive a backbencher&#x27;s salary of about $200,000. Regional Development Minister John McVeigh became Acting Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. A leadership ballot within the National Party resulted in Michael McCormack becoming party leader and deputy prime minister. In September 2018, it was announced that the National Party&#x27;s eight-month investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment had been unable to make a determination, and that the report would remain confidential.

=== Second period as Nationals leader ===
On 4 February 2020 Joyce unsuccessfully challenged McCormack as leader of the Nationals. Joyce returned as leader of the Nationals on 21 June 2021, following a leadership spill.

On 29 June 2021, during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Sydney and while being the active Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce was fined $200 for not wearing a mask in breach of COVID-19 health orders.

In February 2022 it was revealed that Joyce sent a text in March 2021 labelling Prime Minister Scott Morrison a &quot;hypocrite and a liar.&quot; Joyce offered his resignation to the Prime Minister after this became public but the offer was rejected.

After the coalition&#x27;s 2022 federal election defeat, Joyce was challenged by his deputy David Littleproud and party member Darren Chester during a routine leadership spill on 30 May 2022. Joyce lost to Littleproud, ending his 11-month term as the leader.

=== Shadow Minister ===
Subsequently Joyce became Shadow Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the Coalition shadow cabinet.

In September 2023, Joyce joined a cross-party delegation of Australian MPs to Washington, D.C., to lobby the U.S. Department of Justice to abandon its attempts to extradite Australian publisher Julian Assange from the United Kingdom. The other members were Alex Antic, Monique Ryan, David Shoebridge, Peter Whish-Wilson and Tony Zappia.

In February 2024 Joyce was filmed swearing into his phone while lying on his back in a Canberra street, later explaining he had mixed medication with alcohol. There was pressure on the National Party to remove Joyce from the frontbench.

In July 2024 Joyce faced calls to resign as a Shadow Minister after he likened ballot papers to bullets at a protest against a wind farm in Lake Illawarra.

==Political positions==
===Social issues===
====Abortion====
Joyce is opposed to abortion, and in 2018 he lobbied NSW Nationals to vote against a bill to provide &quot;safe zones&quot; around the state&#x27;s abortion clinics. Since 1 July 2018 within NSW, it is illegal to protest within 150 metres of an abortion service.

====Medicinal cannabis====
In June 2014 Joyce changed his views about medicinal cannabis and publicly supported calls for the introduction of a medicinal cannabis trial following a high-profile campaign led by a young man in his constituency who was at the time suffering from an aggressive form of terminal cancer. By 2018, medical cannabis was generally legalised across Australia.

====LGBT rights====
In August 2014 Joyce spoke out in opposition to same-sex marriage, attending several rallies on the matter in Canberra. In 2011, he lobbied against a bill proposed by senator Sarah Hanson-Young that would allow for same-sex couples to marry. On 9 December 2017, same-sex marriage was legalised in Australia.

In January 2025, Joyce said that Australia should copy an executive order signed by Donald Trump which stated that the United States federal government will only recognize two genders, male and female.

====Death penalty====
In April 2015 Joyce called for a national debate on capital punishment in Australia, although he is personally opposed to the death penalty.

====Refugee intake====
In September 2015 Joyce was the first senior minister to call for the Australian Government to accept more Syrian refugees in response to the humanitarian crisis engulfing Turkey and Europe. However, his call to prioritise Christian refugees above those from other faiths drew criticism from some human rights observers.

====Parliamentary rules====
After the birth of his son Sebastian in April 2018, Joyce advocated for changes to parliamentary rules to allow senators and MPs to hire their spouses or partners and relatives. When questioned, he denied this could be a conflict of interest. In December 2018, Joyce raised this issue again to no avail.

==== Religious schools ====
In December 2018 Joyce said schools should be allowed to deny enrolment to transgender students.

==== Burqa ban ====
Joyce is opposed to banning the burqa.

===Economic issues===
====Populist agenda====
Joyce has often angered economic rationalist parliamentary colleagues in the LNP Coalition by taking up a number of causes often labelled as populist; such as his support for the retention of a single-desk wheat export marketing system for Australian grain growers, drought assistance for primary producers, amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974, and media reform regulations that aimed to strengthen the ability of small business to compete with multi-national corporations. When questioned on his views, Joyce stated &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m an agrarian socialist.&quot;

====Foreign investment in Australia====
On 17 March 2009 Joyce launched a privately funded advertising campaign to keep Rio Tinto local, attacking a bid by the Chinese government-owned resources company Chinalco, a bid which had also been heavily criticised by Legal &amp; General in the United Kingdom.

Joyce has also opposed the sale of large Australian agricultural assets to foreign investors. In 2012, as the Opposition spokesman for Water, Joyce was vocal in his unsuccessful opposition to the sale of Cubbie Station to a consortium led by a Chinese State Owned Enterprise. In 2013, as Agriculture Minister, Joyce and his National Party colleagues strongly opposed the proposed sale of Australia&#x27;s largest bulk grain handler GrainCorp to the American company Archer Daniels Midland. The then Liberal Treasurer, Joe Hockey, rejected the sale based on the hugely discretionary &quot;National Interest&quot; grounds which a Treasurer can use to block such transactions. Despite the reasons Hockey used to justify his decision, it was widely reported that the National Party demanded this outcome, with the Labor Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen accusing the junior Coalition partner of &quot;bullying&quot; the Treasurer into arriving at this decision.

In 2015 Joyce voiced opposition to the sale of another large Australian asset to foreign buyers, this time S. Kidman &amp; Co, which owned the largest combined landholdings in Australia, including the iconic Kidman Station. Most of the known interest came from Chinese companies, and Joyce was accused of xenophobia; claims which he rejected. In November 2015, the Treasurer, Scott Morrison decided that the sale of S. Kidman &amp; Co to any foreign investor would not be approved based on national security grounds, due to part of the company being in the vicinity of the Woomera Prohibited Area, among other reasons. The Labor Shadow Agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon slammed the Government&#x27;s decision as &quot;political&quot; and accused it of running a &quot;discriminatory foreign investment regime&quot;.

====Banking royal commission====
When Joyce was leader of the Nationals and deputy prime minister, he repeatedly argued against a banking royal commission. After disturbing evidence emerged after hearings for the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry began in 2018, CPA Joyce said, as a backbencher, that he was wrong and naive in previously opposing a royal commission.

===Environmental issues===

====Renewable energy====
Joyce believes that renewable energy causes problems with energy supply. In January 2021 he called upon Zali Steggall, a prominent renewable energy advocate, to explain why renewable energy had allegedly led to power cuts in Manly and other Sydney suburbs, and followed up with &quot;I don&#x27;t have to win this argument the facts are doing it for me&quot;. Enquiries to Ausgrid showed that the outages were not due to renewable energy but to &quot;unforeseen cable faults&quot;, and that there was no pressure on the grid when the outages occurred.

====Biofouling====
In 2015 Joyce received a Froggatt Award from the Invasive Species Council for taking &quot;principled decisions&quot; in regard to the decision to introduce mandatory biofouling rules to prevent marine pests entering Australia, and for acting quickly and decisively in expelling two dogs belonging to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard which had been brought into Australia in an apparent breach of Australia&#x27;s strict quarantine laws.

In 2021 Heard announced she had named her new dog after Joyce, in reference to the previous controversy.

====Great Barrier Reef====
While his biofouling stance is relevant, Joyce has not taken a keen interest in supporting protection of the Great Barrier Reef with a notable lack of engagement in Parliamentary decisions related to the Great Barrier Reef.

====Global warming====
Joyce is known as one of the climate deniers in the federal Parliamentary Coalition. During 2015 and 2016, Joyce strongly opposed major coal mining in the Liverpool Plains. In 2018, he joined the Monash Forum, a group of Liberal and National MPs who advocate for building new coal-fired power in Australia. Joyce has been seen as a global warming climate change denier, but in 2016 made comment about its possibility based on some of his own personal observations.
In December 2019, he was reported as accepting that the climate was changing but insisting the solution was to respect God, rather than impose a tax to limit emissions. In July 2021, he was reported as saying that the push towards a 2050 net zero carbon emissions commitment is like being served &quot;sautéed gherkins and sashimi tadpoles&quot; at a restaurant, adding that he was &quot;quite happy to consider the menu when you tell me what&#x27;s on it and what it costs&quot;.

====Murray–Darling basin====
In 2016 Joyce supported reducing environmental water allocations in the Murray–Darling basin to reduce the impact on towns and people currently dependent on the rivers. This was contrary to a 2016 election promise by the government, and was widely criticised by environmental groups. In 2017, Joyce stated that the Commonwealth would not intervene regarding accusations of water theft in the basin.

====Endangered species====
In March 2017 Joyce called for Leadbeater&#x27;s possum to be taken off the critically endangered species list to boost the logging of forest to maintain employment. Environmentalists believe that such action would be devastating for the possum and countered that Joyce was prepared to kill two dogs but not ensure the preservation of an entire species.

==Personal life==
Joyce is a Roman Catholic. He met Natalie Abberfield while at university in Armidale, New South Wales. They married in 1993, and together had four daughters. Following his extramarital affair with political staffer Vikki Campion, Joyce announced in December 2017 that he and his wife had separated.

In February 2018 news reports confirmed that Joyce and Campion were expecting a child together; in April, Campion gave birth to a son. Joyce and Campion reportedly accepted $150,000 for an interview with Channel 7&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night&quot; program with the money going into a trust fund for the child. In 2019, a second son was born in Armidale. Joyce became engaged to Campion in January 2022, and they had a country-style wedding on 12 November 2023 at his family estate in Woolbrook, near Walcha.

In the National Rugby League (NRL), Joyce formerly supported the North Queensland Cowboys, but shifted his allegiance to the Newcastle Knights, according to a 2014 article on his website, citing the team’s location just down the New England Highway from his electorate.

<text>Sabin Bălașa (; June 17, 1932 – April 1, 2008) was a contemporary Romanian painter. His works were described by himself as belonging to cosmic Romanticism.

==Biography==
Bălașa was born in Dobriceni, Olt County. After completing his secondary education at Frații Buzești High School in Craiova in 1950, he attended the Nicolae Grigorescu Fine Arts Institute in Bucharest, graduating in 1955. He continued his studies at Siena and Perugia, in Italy.

In 1973 and 1976 the Bucharest Mayor&#x27;s office ordered and paid him to paint the portraits of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu. In the late 1980s, Bălașa was accused of promoting Ceaușescu&#x27;s cult of personality.

In December 2000 he was awarded by President Emil Constantinescu the National Order of Merit, Commander rank.

In June 2005, Bălașa sued the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; for defamation after the paper reproduced a propaganda painting by another painter, claiming it was one of his. Le Monde subsequently acknowledged the error.

He died in 2008 from lung cancer at Sfânta Maria Hospital in Bucharest and was buried at Eternitatea Cemetery in Iași.

==Works==

<doc id="1111098" wikidata="Q352017" url="?curid=1111098" title="Josef Bican">
<text>Josef &quot;Pepi&quot; Bican (25 September 1913 – 12 December 2001) was an Austrian-Czechoslovakian professional footballer who played as a striker. He is regarded by some to be the greatest goalscorer in the history of the sport. He is considered by RSSSF as the second-most prolific goalscorer in history after Erwin Helmchen, with over 950 goals scored in 624 official matches. He scored 591 goals in 301 official games for Slavia Prague across his 11-year playing career at the club.

Bican began his professional career at Rapid Vienna in 1931. After four years at Rapid, he moved to local rivals Admira Vienna. Bican won four league titles during his time in Austria, moved to Slavia Prague in 1937, where he stayed until 1948, and became the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer. He later played for FC Vitkovice, FC Hradec Králové, and Dynamo Praha, retiring in 1955 as the all-time top goalscorer in the Czechoslovak First League with 447 goals. According to UEFA, the governing body for European football, he is the leading all-time goalscorer in European top-flight leagues with 518 goals (447 in Czechoslovakia and 71 in Austria), narrowly ahead of Hungarian Ferenc Puskás.

Bican was a member of the Austrian &quot;Wunderteam&quot; of the 1930s and represented the nation at the 1934 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the semi-finals. He later switched allegiance to the Czechoslovakia national football team, but a clerical error related to his transfer of national team precluded him from playing in the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Bican was a tall and powerful player, with the technical ability to play with both feet, and had considerable pace. During his athletic prime, he was reportedly capable of running 100 metres in 10.8 seconds, which was not far off the leading sprinters of his time.

After his retirement from playing, Bican became a manager, and coached various teams from the 1950s until the 1970s. In 1998, Bican was given a &quot;Medal of Honour&quot; by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) for being among the world&#x27;s most successful top division goalscorers of all time. In 2000, the IFFHS awarded Bican the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; in recognition of his status as the greatest goalscorer of the 20th century. The award was based on how many times a player had been top scorer in his domestic league, a feat which Bican achieved 12 times.

== Early life ==
Josef Bican was born in Favoriten, Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to parents František Bican and Ludmila Kopecka, at Quellenstrasse 101. He was the second of three children, František, Josef and Vilík. His father was from Sedlice in Southern Bohemia, and his mother was a Viennese Czech. Josef&#x27;s father František was a footballer who played for . He fought in World War I and returned uninjured. However, František died at the early age of 30 in 1921 after refusing an operation to treat an infected kidney after an injury sustained during a football match. This was when František was just 10, Josef was 8 and Vilík was 3. Hertha Vienna officials gave František a nice funeral and told Ludmila that they would take care of her sons and would even give them an education. At first they visited the boys every day and would bring something to help out. However this soon changed as they would come every week, once a fortnight and within three months it was as if they had forgotten about the Bican family. Ludmila was stuck in a desperate situation, she sent Vilík to be looked after by his grandparents in Bohemia, until he was 14. Ludmila&#x27;s life got harder as she had to work twice as hard as before, cleaning crayfish and washing dishes at a nearby restaurant. Most days she would have to get up at four in the morning to come home at ten, but sometimes even later.

The family&#x27;s poverty meant that Bican initially had to play football without shoes, which helped him improve his ball control skills. Bican attended the Jan Amos Komenský school, a Czech school in Vienna. For entertainment František and Josef would make a football out of old material and sometimes Ludmila would be left without one stocking. On some days they would arrive at school with dirty clothes and foreheads due to playing football before school. They would play matches between classes and between schools, they had no time to study. Josef would play football so much that she had to lock him indoors to try and get him to study. The players at his school would whistle and call to Josef to get him to come to a match that day. He lived one story up, but this didn&#x27;t stop him. He climbed out the window and played the game. The school team was victorious as the score was 12–2, Josef had scored 8 goals.

His older brother, František, was also a good footballer, as he started playing for Hertha Vienna, aged 11. However, František died tragically at 17. They had brought him home with a knife in his heart. They had told the Bican family that it was a very unfortunate accident that he had taken his own life. In situations like these Ludmila was normally brave, however this time she was scared and she sent Josef to live with Vilík and his grandparents.

Working at Schustek parquet factory, Josef would work around the office and in the warehouse and earnt twenty shillings a week. In the spring of 1931 Farbenlutz attracted Bican to start working for them as he would earn 30 shillings a week.

==Early career==
In 1925, at the age of twelve, Bican was already playing in the youth set-up of , his father&#x27;s beloved club, and also where his idol, Matthias Sindelar had begun his career. At Hertha, he was coached by a former player that had played with his father. The Hertha Vienna pitch was only a few steps away from his house. Bican was the smallest of the boys there, however, his ability to score goals caught the attention of everyone around. One of the club’s officials was so impressed that he told him, “You’ll get a shilling every time you score.” He scored two in his very first match. Thus, football became a vital income to the poor Bican family.

As his career slowed down at Hertha Vienna, due to him not playing for almost half a year, one of his friends invited him to play for Schustek. It was a parquet factory, small but profitable. At the age of 15, in the autumn of 1928, Bican made his debut for Schustek. Josef scored three goals in a 5–2 friendly victory over Nord Vienna. It is said that once his mother, who had come to watch him, was so annoyed about a foul her son received that she ran onto the pitch and beat the opponent with her umbrella. In 1931 he would start playing for Farbenlutz and would not even train.

Near to where Bican lived, Roman Schramseis also resided and after seeing Bican play on several occasions, Roman offered him the chance to train at Rapid Wien. “I already told Richard Kuthan about it.” In his first youth game for the club, he scored seven goals, and so he was promoted to the Amateur side, which was typically for 18- and 19-year-olds. Bican was invited to watch a training session with the amateur team, but as soon as he and his friend watched the others play they got scared and headed home. The next Tuesday, Bican was to play a training game between the junior team and the amateur team. He played for the junior team and scored five goals as they won 7–2. On the Sunday of the same week, he was again invited to play for the adult team. Rapid Wien beat their opponents 4–2 with two goals from Bican. After three months, in June 1931, he was promoted to the Reserves.

== Club career ==
=== Rapid Vienna ===
In 1931, when Bican first joined Rapid Vienna, he received 150 schillings, but, by the age of 20, Rapid wanted to keep him so much that they paid him 600 schillings. In 1931, for Rapid Vienna&#x27;s Reserve team, Josef scored 30 goals in 16 games. In his debut game against Austria Wien, club where Matthias Sindelar played, Bican scored four goals in a victory 5–3.

Bican recalls the game as this: &quot;Sometime in the tenth minute, I received the ball from the right, in a large amount of space, went around Gall and with my left foot, I scored the first goal, into the corner. Weselik broke through and struck a shot that hit the cross bar, on the rebound I hooked the ball into the net, again, with my left foot. Before halftime, I scored my third goal, a nice, clean instep at full speed. My teammates rushed towards me and carried me to the center of the field. For my fourth, I luckily got past Mock and only Gall was in front of me, he took me to the ground, but I was still able to shoot and score the decisive fifth goal. When the match was over, everyone was kissing me. But in the dressing room they had to cut open my sleeve, to get my shirt off me. I had finished the game with a swollen wrist. I didn&#x27;t even notice it. The joy was greater than the pain&quot;. In 1932 Josef scored 51 goals in 42 games for Rapid Vienna. 23 goals in 9 reserve team games and 28 goals in 33 first team games In 1933 Josef signed a contract to play a game for Wiener AC, in which they beat Phonix Schwechat 6-2, with Josef scoring 4.

Bican won the Austrian title with Rapid in 1934–35 and his first goalscoring accolade, but by the end of the season, he had been suspended after refusing to sign a new contract and Bican decided to go on strike. In total for Rapid Vienna, Josef played 156 games and scored 201 goals. Through one of his uncles, a deal was done with Admira Vienna, at the time the most successful side in Austrian history. Rapid however, refused to release his registration, and Bican went nine months without playing a game. When he was allowed to leave, Bican won championships in both his seasons with the Vienna club, but his heart was set on his family&#x27;s homeland.

=== Slavia Prague ===
During early January 1937, Bican left Admira Vienna to join Czech club Slavia Prague, he signed a contract for them, despite being on a friendly tour of Egypt. His contract had already ended for Admira Vienna, in 1936, however he was still allowed to play for them. The Austrian Union needed Bican for an inter-state match, they demanded Bican to sign a contract at the beginning of December, if he did not do so, his old contract would be extended for a year. However, Bican did not back down and was adamant to leave.

In his first season at the club, Bican was both the league&#x27;s top scorer with 22 goals and the 1938 Mitropa Cup with 10 goals, and although Slavia finished as runner-ups in the league, they won the cup after a 4–2 aggregate win over Ferencváros, with Bican netting once in the first leg. The following season, in March 1939, Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and football split on similar lines, with Bohemian and Moravian clubs carrying their results from the Czechoslovak league into the new Bohemian-Moravian league. Bican was again the top scorer of the league, this time with 29 goals, but Sparta Prague, Slavia&#x27;s greatest rival, won the championship again.

The third year (1941), Bican&#x27;s won his first of four Championships along with the third of 10 consecutive goal scoring accolades. He played for Slavia throughout World War II, while many of his football rivals were at war. In August 1941, Bican played in a friendly match against SK Mnichova Hradiste. In the first half, Slavia were 10-1 up with Bican scoring all 10 of the goals. Bican didn&#x27;t play in the second half and the overall play was poor from Slavia, as the score ended 13-3. During eight league seasons he scored 328 goals, including 57 in 26 matches one particular season (1943–44). During the 1939–40 season, he set a world record for the longest goal-scoring streak in a European top division when he scored at least one goal for 19 games in a row, netting a total of 47 goals over his run that included hat-tricks in 5 back-to-back league games. His record stood for 73 years until it was broken in 2013 by Lionel Messi (21 games in the Spanish league). Three times in his career, Bican scored seven goals in a game. In a 1939–40 league match against Zlín, Bican found the net seven times as Slavia ran out 10–1 winners. During the 1940–41 season, Bican matched his feat of the previous season, again against Zlín, scoring seven times, as Slavia won by a 12–1 scoreline. It was 1947–48 before Bican managed his third seven-goal match, as Slavia defeated České Budějovice in a game which finished 15–1.

He was in the leagues that he played, the top-scorer 12 times during his 25-year professional career and Europe&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s top scorer in five consecutive seasons, from 1939–40 to 1943–44, a record that still stands.

=== Last years ===
Several clubs were interested in signing Bican after the war ended. Bican joined steel works Železárny Vítkovice. During 1952, he joined FC Hradec Králové, where he managed to score 53 goals in 26 matches. On 1 May 1953, the Communist Party forced him to leave the city and, therefore, the club. After being forced to leave, he returned to Slavia Prague, or, as it was known then, Dynamo Prague. He continued to play for Dynamo until retiring from playing at the age of 42 in 1955. He was the oldest player in the league at that time.

== International career ==
On 29 November 1933, aged 20 years and 64 days, Bican made his debut for Austria in a 2–2 draw against Scotland. He later played for them at the 1934 World Cup, when the Austrian &quot;Wunderteam&quot; reached the semifinals. His solitary goal in the tournament came in extra time of Austria&#x27;s 3–2 win over France.

At the time Bican was playing for Slavia Prague, he applied for Czechoslovak citizenship. However, when he eventually became a Czechoslovak citizen, he discovered that a clerical error meant he couldn&#x27;t play at the 1938 World Cup. He scored two hat-tricks for Czechoslovakia, including a four-goal haul against Romania in the 1937–38 Eduard Benes Cup in a 6–2 win. He also played for Bohemia &amp; Moravia, playing only one match for them against Nazi Germany on 12 November 1939, and scoring a hat-trick in a 4–4 draw. In total, he scored 29 goals in 34 international matches for three national teams (Austria, Czechoslovakia and Bohemia &amp; Moravia). His final national team appearance was for Czechoslovakia in a 3–1 defeat against Bulgaria on 4 September 1949, a few days short from his 36th birthday.

However, his success did have a disadvantage. Other members of the team became jealous of the tall, handsome Bican&#x27;s success, and he was sometimes called abusive names, such as &quot;Austrian bastard&quot;.

In addition to representing Austria, Czechoslovakia and the region of Bohemia &amp; Moravia, Bican also played a number of fixtures playing for teams consisting of the best players from a league or town between 1939 and 1949. For the Bohemia-Moravia league team in 1939 he played six games scoring nine goals, for the Bohemia league team in 1940–1944 he played eight games scoring 11 goals, for Prague from 1938 to 1948 he played 12 games scoring 11 goals and Ostrava in 1950–51 he played ten games scoring 10 goals, bringing Bican&#x27;s total number of official goals outside of club football to 67 goals in 69 games.

==Personal life==
Grandfather František and Grandmother Terezie were one of the poorest families of the town. Grandfather František’s second son Josef, died during the war and for financial support they took 50 koruna per month. The start of young Josef’s love for fishing came when Grandfather František took him and Vilík to a nearby river and the boys would fish either side of František. His refusal is described in the book: &quot;I was born in Vienna, but my father was Czech, just like my mother,&quot; he finally declared. &quot;I always felt like a Czech, and if I did something else, my dad would turn in his grave!&quot; Although the author was based on contemporary sources, he considers these words to be credible. &quot;When I spoke to him, he always emphasized his Czechness,&quot; reveals Zikmund.

==Life after retirement==


Tongeren hired him as a coach in 1968, where he had some success taking them from Division 4 to Division 2.

Around this time, Pelé was getting ready for his 1000th goal and many journalists were searching for another player who had scored a thousand goals. Former Austrian player Franz &quot;Bimbo&quot; Binder suggested Bican, who he claimed to have scored over 5000 goals in all competitions. When reporters asked Bican why he had not sought more attention for his goalscoring feats, he simply said, &quot;who&#x27;d have believed me if I said I&#x27;d scored five times as many goals as Pelé?&quot; However, to score over 5000 goals he should have kept an average of 185 goals/year along all his 27 years of career, but only counting goals in official matches, Bican scored at least 950 goals. Bican&#x27;s goal-scoring feats are often forgotten because he did not make a big fuss about it in the media. His record is often overshadowed by Pelé&#x27;s 1303 goal record, including goals in unofficial matches. But shortly before his death in 2001, IFFHS based on RSSSF statistics declared Bican with 643 league goals, the most prolific scorer of the 20th century. This was judged by the number of times a player had been top scorer in his domestic league. Bican managed this feat 12 times, more than any other player in football history.

In the 1990s, Bican spoke to Czech TV about the difficulty of scoring during his era: &quot;When I talk to young reporters, they always say, &#x27;Mr Bican, scoring was easier back in your day.&#x27; But I ask them, &#x27;How come? Look, are there opportunities today?&#x27; And they tell me, &#x27;Of course there are, many of them&#x27;. And I say, &#x27;There you go. If there weren&#x27;t opportunities, it would be difficult. But if there are, scoring is the same as it was a hundred years ago, and will be the same in a hundred years&#x27; time, too. It will always be the same.&quot; Bican further stated: &quot;Everybody would agree that a chance should be a goal. If I got five chances, I scored five goals – if I got seven then it was seven.&quot;

&quot;Bican was incredibly unlucky at the height of his career. There was no World Cup in 1942 or 1946 because of the war. If the 1942 edition had taken place, for example, he would surely have become more widely known. Perhaps he might even have been as famous as Pele&quot;, Radovan Jelinek, sports historian said about him.

==Death==
After suffering from heart problems for several months, Bican died in Prague on 12 December 2001 at the age of 88, and was buried in Vyšehrad cemetery.

On 25 September 2013, which would have been Bican&#x27;s 100th birthday, Slavia Prague commemorated him by wearing shirts that featured a replica of his signature on them.

== Style of play ==
After a game for Rapid Vienna against Austria Vienna, an author in the Austrian newspaper Montagblatt, wrote: &quot;Bican is not the conductor with a great concept. His game is excessive, his assists are difficult to achieve due to their unsaved accuracy.&quot;

After an Admira Vienna game against Red Star Vienna, in 1936, an author in the Austrian newspaper Montagblatt, wrote: &quot;The most mentioned player on the field was undeniably Bican, not only because of his transfer issues, but also for his truly remarkable performances. His dribbling, fine ball control, and deceiving his opponents were a real feast for the eyes of the spectators. After all, this time Bican was also his team&#x27;s most successful player, scoring three goals.&quot;

Recalling Bican, his former Slavia team-mate Ján Andrejkovič said: &quot;Pepi was a player with all the qualities of a star. Excellent technique with left or right foot, outstanding headers, perfect positional play, precise passing and, above all, an incredible goalscorer.&quot;

In 1940, a journalist for Slavia Prague wrote, &quot;Bican is undeniably one of our best footballers. We can boldly say that he is one of the best centre forwards in Europe. What he lacks, in perhaps hardness, he makes up for in his unique ball technique. During his time in Prague, Bican has proven to be world class many times.&quot;

<doc id="1111101" wikidata="Q3416356" url="?curid=1111101" title="H2X">
<text>H2X, eventually designated as the AN/APS-15, was an American ground scanning radar system used for blind bombing during World War II. It was developed at the MIT Radiation Laboratory under direction of Dr. George E. Valley Jr. to replace the less accurate British H2S radar, the first ground mapping radar to be used in combat. H2X was also known as the &quot;Mickey set&quot; and &quot;BTO&quot; for &quot;bombing through the overcast&quot; radar.

H2X differed from the original H2S primarily in its 3-cm wavelength X band rather than H2S&#x27; 10-cm S band. This shorter wavelength gave H2X higher resolution than H2S, allowing it to provide usable images over large cities which appeared as a single blob on the H2S display. The Royal Air Force (RAF) initially considered using H2X as well, but would instead develop their own X band system, the H2S Mk. III. The RAF system entered service in late 1943, before the first use of H2X in early 1944.

The desire for even higher resolution, enough to image individual docks and bridges, led to a number of variations on the H2X system, as well as the more advanced AN/APQ-7 &quot;Eagle&quot; system. All of these were replaced in the post-war era with systems customized for the jet powered strategic bombers that entered service.

==Usage==
H2X was used by the USAAF during World War II as a navigation system for daylight overcast and nighttime operations. It was introduced as an improvement of the earlier H2S set, which had been supplied to the US to aid in the war effort. While the RAF Bomber Command utilized ground mapping radar as an aid to night area bombing, the primary use by the USAAF was as a fallback, to allow cities to be bombed even when hidden by cloud cover, an issue that had dogged their policy of precision daylight bombing since the start of the war, especially in cloud-prone Europe. With H2X, a city could be located and a general area targeted, night or day, cloud cover or no, with equal accuracy. H2X used a shorter 3 cm &quot;centimetric&quot; wavelength (10 GHz frequency) than the H2S, giving a higher angular resolution and thus a sharper picture, which allowed much finer details to be discerned, aiding in target identification. H2S subsequently also adopted 3 cm in the Mark III version entering operational service on 18 November 1943, for &quot;Battle of Berlin&quot;).

H2X is not known to have ever been spotted by the German FuG 350 Naxos radar detector, due to that receiving device&#x27;s specific purpose being to spot the original British H2S equipment&#x27;s lower frequency, 3 GHz emissions.

==Pathfinder missions==
The first H2X-equipped B-17&#x27;s arrived in England in early October 1943, and were first used in combat on 3 November 1943 when the USAAF VIII Bomber Command attacked the port of Wilhelmshaven. Those missions where bombing was done by H2X were called &quot;Pathfinder missions&quot; and the crews were called &quot;Pathfinder crews&quot;, after the RAF practice of using highly trained Pathfinder crews to go in before the main bomber stream and identify and mark the target with flares.
American practice used their Pathfinder crews as lead bombers, with radar equipped aircraft being followed by formations of radar-less bombers, which would all drop their loads when the lead bomber did. The ventral hemispherical radome for the H2X&#x27;s rotating dish antenna replaced the ball turret on B-17 Flying Fortress Pathfinders, with the electronics cabinets for the &quot;Mickey set&quot; being installed in the radio room just aft of the bomb bay. The system was used extensively by The 91st Bomb Group in 1945 with occasional excellent but generally inconsistent results.

The H2X on later B-24 Liberators also replaced the ball turret, being made retractable as the ball turret was for landing on the Liberator. The operators panel was installed on the flight deck behind the co-pilot (where the radio operator&#x27;s normal position was). In combat areas the Mickey operator directed the pilot on headings to be taken, and on the bomb run directed the airplane in coordination with the bombardier. The first use of Mickey was against Ploiești on 5 April 1944.

==Radar mapping of Germany==
Due to the absence of radar maps, in late April 1944 six PR Mk.XVI de Havilland Mosquito aircraft in the 482nd Bomb Group were equipped with H2X equipment. The idea was to produce photographs of the radar screen during flights over Germany allowing easy interpretation of these radar images in later bombing runs. Three aircraft were subsequently lost in training, and the project was discontinued. A further twelve PR Mk.XVI Mosquitos of the 25th Bomb Group (Reconnaissance) of the Eighth Air Force were fitted with H2X and beginning in May 1944, flew radar mapping night missions until February 1945.

The sets tended to overload the Mosquito&#x27;s electrical system and occasionally exploded. Mickey-equipped Mosquitos had the highest loss, abort, and mission failure rates of any version of the otherwise successful Mosquito reconnaissance aircraft, and were severely curtailed after 19 February 1945. Three were lost to enemy action and one was shot down by friendly fire from a Ninth Air Force P-47. In Europe several P-38 fighters were also converted to carrying H2X radar in the nose, along with an operator/navigator in a cramped compartment in the nose behind the radar dish, provided with small side windows and an access/exit hatch in the floor (much like the earlier P-38 &quot;Droop Snoot&quot; bomber-leader variants, but with a radome instead of a glazed nose). These missions were to obtain radar maps of German targets but plans to produce the variant in quantity never materialized.

==B-29 equipment==
In the Pacific theater, B-29’s were equipped with the improved H2X radar called the AN/APQ-13, a ground scanning radar developed by Bell, Western Electric, and MIT. The radome was carried on the aircraft belly between the bomb bays and was partially retractable. The radar operated at a frequency of 9,375 ± 45 megahertz and used a superheterodyne receiver. The radar was used for high altitude area bombing, search and navigation. Computation for bombing could be performed by an impact predictor. A range unit permitted a high degree of accuracy in locating beacons.

==Post war usage==
Post-war, the AN/APQ-13 became the first military radar converted to a domestic peacetime application as a storm warning radar. About thirty systems were converted and installed on military bases. It was replaced by the AN/CPS-9 system in 1949.

<text>The Ebu Gogo are a group of human-like creatures that appear in the folklore of Flores, Indonesia. In the Nage language of central Flores, &quot;ebu&quot; means &quot;grandparent&quot; and &quot;gogo&quot; means &quot;one who eats anything&quot;. A colloquial English equivalent might be something like &quot;old glutton&quot;.

== Folklore record ==
The Nage people of Flores describe the Ebu Gogo as having been able walkers and fast runners around tall. They reportedly had wide and flat noses, and broad faces with large mouths and hairy bodies. The females also had &quot;long, pendulous breasts&quot;. They were said to have murmured in what was assumed to be their own language and could reportedly repeat what was said to them in a parrot-like fashion.

The legends relating to the Ebu Gogo were traditionally attributed to monkeys, according to the journal &quot;Nature&quot;.

An article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; gives the following account of folklore on Flores surrounding the Ebu Gogo: in the 18th century, villagers gave the Ebu Gogo a gift of palm fiber to make clothes, and once the Ebu Gogo took the fiber into their cave, the villagers threw in a firebrand to set it alight, killing all of the occupants (one pair may have fled into the forest).

There are also legends about the Ebu Gogo kidnapping human children, hoping to learn how to cook them. The children always easily outwit the Ebu Gogo in the tales.

== Proposed connection to &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; ==

The &quot;ebu gogo&quot; folklore has gained public attention with the discovery of &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, an extinct hominid species that inhabited Flores until c. 50,000 years ago or later. The ethnologist Gregory Forth (2008) has suggested that tales about &quot;ebu gogo&quot; and similar figures in the folklore of Indonesia such as the Orang Pendek are based on the memory of actual encounters between modern humans and &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;. Linguist John McWhorter also supports this hypothesis regarding the &quot;ebu gogo&quot;. The hypothesis of contacts between the &quot;ebu gogo&quot; and the ancestors of the present population is also sustained by the unique designs of Ngadha ikat: their motifs are executed as stick figures, which give them a strikingly &#x27;primitive&#x27; appearance resembling some prehistoric cave drawings.

This proposal has little mainstream support, especially after the dating of youngest known skeleton of &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, which initially was assumed to have lived c. 12,000 BP, was revised to 50,000 BP.

<text>The Peugeot 607 is an executive car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from September 1999 to June 2010.

The 607, along with the smaller 407, were superseded by the 508 in March 2011.

==History==
The 607 was launched in October 1999, to replace the discontinued 605. It used its predecessor&#x27;s chassis but had an all-new, more modern exterior design. The engine range (2.2 and 3.0 petrol, and 2.2 diesel) was completely new. Built in Sochaux until March 2009, the assemble of the 607 was transferred to PSA&#x27;s Rennes plant in July the same year as production was being wound down.

Equipment levels were high, with all models getting air conditioning, CD player, electric windows, 8 airbags, anti-lock braking system, tyre-pressure monitor, and central locking as standard. Available was AMVAR nine-stage electronic damping control.

In France, its home market, the 607 was often chosen for official government use.

==Safety==

==Facelift==
The 607 was restyled in November 2004, with the most notable modifications being the new front end and the 2.7 HDi V6 engine, rated at , with a new six-speed automatic gearbox, which became also available on the V6 petrol model. The 2.0 and 2.2 diesel engines increased in output and included a 6-speed transmission, like the newly introduced Peugeot 407.

During 2008, the 607 was withdrawn from the United Kingdom, marking the end of right-hand drive 607s.


==Peugeot 607 Paladine==

The Peugeot 607 Paladine is a special Landaulet version of the 607 which was developed and built in 2000 in cooperation with Heuliez, as a concept car. The engine is the 3.0 V6. It is lengthened by (making it long), and the rear part is equipped with a retractable metallic roof similar to the Peugeot 206&#x27;s or 307&#x27;s CC. It is a one off design.

The special leather interior was developed in cooperation with Hermès.

The car was first presented at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2000. It was used seven years later by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his inauguration on May 16, 2007. Meanwhile, the car had been retrofitted with the 2004 restyling of the 607 (updated front end).

==Successor==
In November 2009, Philippe Varin from PSA announced that the successor of the Peugeot 607 would not be called the Peugeot 608, but instead the Peugeot 508. The 508 also replaced the smaller Peugeot 407.

<text>Jalen Anthony Rose (born January 30, 1973) is an American sports analyst and former professional basketball player. In college, he was a member of the University of Michigan Wolverines&#x27; &quot;Fab Five&quot; (along with Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson) that reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship games as both freshmen and sophomores.

Rose played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a small forward for six teams, most notably alongside Reggie Miller on the Indiana Pacers team that made three consecutive Eastern Conference finals, and reached the 2000 NBA Finals. He retired in 2007 with a career average of 14.3 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game.

Rose was a sports analyst for ABC and ESPN. He was an analyst on &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; and &quot;Get Up!&quot;, and he co-hosted the ESPN talk show, &quot;Jalen &amp; Jacoby&quot;, with co-host David Jacoby until late 2022. He is also the founder of the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy and the author of &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller &quot;Got to Give the People What They Want&quot; and producer of the ESPN documentary &quot;The Fab Five.&quot;

==Early life==
Rose&#x27;s biological father Jimmy Walker was a No. 1 overall draft pick in the NBA who started in the backcourt alongside Jerry West in the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. Although they eventually spoke several times over the phone, Rose never met his father in person. Walker died in July 2007 of lung cancer.

Rose&#x27;s mother, Jeanne, named him from a combination of his father&#x27;s name, James, and his uncle&#x27;s name, Leonard. As a result of Rose&#x27;s prominence in the NCAA and NBA, Jalen became one of the most popular names for African-American boys born in the 1990s and early 2000s. A number of notable American athletes who began play in the 2010s are named Jalen, after Rose, including Jalen Hurts, Jaylen Brown, Jalen Mayfield, Jalen Brunson, Jalen Green, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Suggs, and Jaylen Waddle. In 2021, there were 32 players with some variation of the name Jalen on rosters in the NBA, NFL, and other North American professional sports, with an additional 80 who played men&#x27;s college basketball.

==College career==

As a star at Southwestern High School in Detroit, where he was teammates with future NBA players Voshon Lenard and Howard Eisley, Rose obtained a high profile and can even be seen at a high school All-American camp in the documentary film &quot;Hoop Dreams.&quot; Rose attended the University of Michigan where the Wolverines reached two NCAA Finals games in 1992 and 1993, finishing as national runners up both times. Rose was a part of Wolverines coach Steve Fisher&#x27;s legendary 1991 recruiting class, dubbed the &quot;Fab Five&quot;. He led the Fab Five in scoring his freshman year, averaging 17.6 points per game, and set the school freshman scoring record with 597 total points. Aside from being the most outspoken of the Fab Five, Rose was also their small forward and leader. While he did not win an NCAA title, he racked up over 1700 points, 400 rebounds, 400 assists, and 100 steals. At 6-8 and playing as a versatile point guard, some reporters started comparing Rose to his schoolboy idol Magic Johnson. Of the players called before the grand jury (Robert Traylor, Webber, Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock) in the University of Michigan basketball scandal, Rose was the only one not listed as having received large amounts of money, though when questioned by the grand jury, Rose confessed to having received money from Martin, but said that it was only occasional gifts of a couple hundred dollars in spending money.

==NBA career==

===Denver Nuggets (1994–1996)===
Rose was selected 13th overall by the Denver Nuggets in the 1994 NBA draft. He averaged 8.2 points and 2.0 rebounds per game in 81 games (37 starts) for his rookie season. He averaged ten points and 2.7 rebounds in 80 games (37 starts) for his second and last season in Denver.

===Indiana Pacers (1996–2002)===
After two years with Denver, Rose was traded to the Indiana Pacers, along with Reggie Williams and a future first round draft pick, for Mark Jackson, Ricky Pierce, and a 1st round draft pick.

Despite his successes in Indiana, he was not readily accepted early on. Rose frequently logged DNPCDs (Did Not Play – Coach&#x27;s Decision) under Coach Larry Brown. Rose also often spoke out about the fact he was being used as a backup two-guard and small forward over his preference, which was point guard. It was not until Larry Bird took over coaching duties did Rose finally begin to blossom, eventually realizing he was most effective at small forward.

As a member of the Indiana Pacers, Rose helped the team get back on its feet after a disastrous 1996–97 season and make it to three consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearances. Rose became the first player in eight years other than Reggie Miller to lead the Pacers in scoring in the 1999–2000 season when he averaged 18.2 points per game for the eventual Eastern Conference Champions, winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award in the process, the first time in Pacers history. During the 2000 NBA playoffs, Rose scored 40 points during Indiana’s Eastern Conference Semifinals Game 1 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. After winning that series, and helping lead his team all the way to the 2000 NBA Finals, Rose went on to average 25 points per game in the six game series, including a 32-point effort in a game five win. However, the Pacers lost the series to the Los Angeles Lakers. This playoff series is also remembered for Rose intentionally placing his foot underneath Kobe Bryant in game 2, while Bryant was landing back to the ground after shooting a jump shot, in an effort to cause Bryant injury (which Rose later admitted to intentionally doing). Bryant would miss Game 3 of the series due to an injury after landing on Rose&#x27;s foot.

===Chicago Bulls (2002–2003)===
During the 2001–02 season, Rose was traded to the Chicago Bulls along with Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a future second round draft pick in exchange for Brad Miller, Ron Mercer, Ron Artest and Kevin Ollie. On March 16, 2002, Rose scored a career-high 44 points and hit a game-winning shot during 114–112 overtime win against the Houston Rockets.

===Toronto Raptors (2003–2006)===
After 16 games in the 2003–04 season, Rose was traded to the Toronto Raptors, along with power forwards Donyell Marshall and Lonny Baxter. On January 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant scored 81 points while being defended by Rose, the second-greatest scoring performance in NBA history.

===New York Knicks (2006)===
On February 3, 2006, midway through the 2005–06 season, Rose was traded, along with a first-round draft pick, and an undisclosed sum of cash (believed to be around $3 million), to the New York Knicks for Antonio Davis, where he was reunited with Larry Brown, his coach for one year with the Indiana Pacers. The motivation behind this trade was apparently to free up cap space (Rose earned close to $16 million a year) and to allow the Raptors to acquire an experienced center who could relieve some of Chris Bosh&#x27;s rebounding duties. Rose&#x27;s final game and contribution for the Raptors was a home win against the Sacramento Kings, where he scored the winning basket in overtime.

===Phoenix Suns (2006–2007)===
On November 3, 2006, Rose announced he would sign with the Suns. On November 7, it was officially announced that Rose had signed a $1.5 million one-year deal with Phoenix. 

===Retirement===
Rose retired from the NBA in 2007 with a career average of 14.3 points, 3.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game.

==Post-NBA career and broadcasting==

Rose worked as a Sideline Reporter for the 2006 NBA Playoffs for TNT. Since his retirement in 2007, Rose has worked at ABC/ESPN, first as an analyst on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and in 2012 he became one of the hosts for &quot;NBA Countdown&quot;. Rose has also worked on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Grantland&quot;.
Jalen Rose works as an occasional Studio Analyst for College Basketball on Peacock and as a fill-in Studio Analyst for the NBA on TNT during the 2024-25 season

Rose is the owner of Three Tier Entertainment, an independent, Los Angeles based management and production company. Created in 2007, Three Tier Entertainment develops television and film projects and also manages talent including directors, actors and screenplay writers. In 2011, he produced the ESPN documentary &quot;The Fab Five.&quot; The Fab Five earned a 2.1 rating to become ESPNʼs highest rated documentary according to the Nielsen Company. The documentary even sparked a controversy that led to a series of media exchanges between members of the press, Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball players, and Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s basketball players.

In 2015, Rose released &quot;Got to Give the People What They Want,&quot; a book about his personal life story. It is a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller and made the list of Michigan Notable Books from 2016. He co-hosted &quot;Jalen &amp; Jacoby&quot;, a national US sports radio show on ESPN Radio, with David Jacoby, until late 2022. Starting in April 2018, Rose was a guest analyst of &quot;Get Up!&quot;, a three-hour morning sports talk show on ESPN.

Rose also has a multi-platform partnership with the &quot;New York Post&quot; where he hosts a podcast and weekly column under the name &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;.

Rose was laid off by ESPN on June 30, 2023, in a round of cost cuts of public-facing commentators.

==Player profile==
A left-handed player, Rose was known to have a smooth and versatile offensive game, and was particularly gifted as a scorer from the perimeter or the post. Rose was used throughout his career at three different positions. He began his career as a point guard for the Denver Nuggets and became a shooting guard/small forward for the Indiana Pacers. He then returned to the point guard position briefly with the Toronto Raptors. However, during his career he was most effective as a small forward or swingman. Rose was also a good passer, especially for his height, and Indiana often employed him as a point forward. Not known for his defense, Rose&#x27;s best moment defensively came during the 1997–1998 season, when Rose emerged as a defensive stopper on Michael Jordan in the Eastern Conference Finals, though the Bulls pulled out the series in seven games. Rose has sometimes been regarded as a team leader, particularly under head coach Larry Bird, though he reportedly was a disruptive force in the Pacers&#x27; locker room during his feud with the coach at that time Isiah Thomas, after Thomas cut former Fab Five teammate Jimmy King on the final day to do so before the 2000–2001 season.

While in Toronto, Rose also frequently clashed with Raptors coach Sam Mitchell, who benched a struggling Jalen early in the 2005–06 season in favor of rookie Joey Graham.

In the following months, Rose increased his Player Efficiency Rating more than three points (to 13.7) while averaging 12.1 points, 2.5 assists, and 2.8 rebounds per game. However, he only shot 40.4% from the field and 27% from three-point range (including a 51.4 true shooting percentage) through 46 games.

In 2003, Rose was honored with the Professional Basketball Writers Association Magic Johnson Award. Jalen was inducted into the Detroit High School Hall of Fame in 2013 and Michigan Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. In 2019, Rose was inducted into the American Basketball Hall of Fame in his hometown of Detroit.
==Philanthropy==

In 2000, Rose established the Jalen Rose Foundation/Charitable Fund to create life-changing opportunities for underserved youth through the development of unique programs and the distribution of grants to qualified nonprofit organizations. Grants focus on education and sports and are distributed in Jalen&#x27;s hometown of Detroit and in other communities in need.

Rose established the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy (JRLA) in 2011. The academy is an open enrollment, tuition free, public charter high school on the Northwest side of Detroit. The academy serves over 400 ninth through twelfth grade students and graduated its inaugural class in June 2015 – one hundred percent of the academy&#x27;s graduates have gained college, trade/technical school or military acceptance. The mission is to provide a leadership-focused experience within a high-performing high school that engages and inspires Detroit area youth to achieve at the rigorous level necessary to graduate with a college degree and thrive in life. Rose serves as the President of the Board of Directors.

&quot;The Detroit News&quot; has recognized Rose with the Michiganian of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence, courage and philanthropy to uplift the metropolitan area and Michigan. In 2016, he was awarded the 11th Annual National Civil Rights Museum Sports Legacy Award for his contributions to civil and human rights, and for laying the foundation for future leaders through his career in sports in the spirit of Dr. King. Rose won the award for establishing the Jalen Rose Foundation, which creates opportunities for underprivileged youth. In addition, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame awarded Rose the 2016 Mannie Jackson – Basketball&#x27;s Human Spirit Award.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Rose earned a Bachelor of Science in Management Studies from the University of Maryland University College. He remains an active supporter of his alma mater, the University of Michigan, and was seen rooting for their men&#x27;s basketball team during the 2006 NIT Final Four with fellow ex-Wolverine, Maurice Taylor. He also was seen in Atlanta, Georgia for the Wolverines&#x27; 2013 NCAA National Title game.

In 2011, Rose was arrested, pleaded guilty and served time in jail for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in West Bloomfield Township, Michigan.

In July 2018, Rose married for the first time to ESPN personality Molly Qerim in a private ceremony. In 2021, he filed for divorce from Qerim. He stated that their marriage broke down after she moved to Connecticut.

<doc id="1111140" wikidata="Q6161920" url="?curid=1111140" title="Suicide of Jason Altom">
<text>Jason Altom (6 October 1971 – 15 August 1998) was an American PhD student working in the research group of Nobel laureate Elias James Corey at Harvard University. He killed himself by taking potassium cyanide in 1998, citing in his suicide note &quot;abusive research supervisors&quot; as one reason for taking his life. Altom was studying a complex natural product and felt enormous pressure to finish the molecule before starting his academic career.

Altom&#x27;s suicide highlighted the pressures on PhD students, problems of isolation in graduate school, and sources of tension between graduate mentors and their students. His case prompted many US universities to insist that PhD students have an advisory committee in addition to a supervisor, to whom they might turn for support: James Anderson, who became Harvard Chemistry Department Chairman, stated that &quot;Jason&#x27;s death prompted an examination of the role the department should play in graduate students&#x27; lives&quot;. Anderson went on to promise that students will also have &quot;confidential and seamless access&quot; to psychological counselling services, paid for by the department. Harvard students have access to &quot;as many visits as medically necessary&quot; for mental health services if seen at university health services (unless they opt out of the Student Health Fee), and up to 52 visits per plan year when enrolling in the Student Health Insurance Plan. As part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Harvard Graduate Students Union and the university&#x27;s administration, a fund was created to reimburse members &quot;of any copays and other out-of-pocket medical expenses&quot; incurred under the Student Health Insurance Plan; in 2024, it holds $530,000. The collective bargaining agreement also forces the university administration to disclose mental health resources to the union.

The molecule whose synthesis Altom was attempting to complete, aspidophytine, was subsequently completed by postdoctoral research associates and published in the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; in 1999. The article was dedicated to Altom&#x27;s memory.

<text>Taotao Mo&#x27;na, also commonly written as taotaomona or taotaomo&#x27;na (Chamoru &quot;taotao&quot;, &quot;person/people&quot; and &quot;mo&#x27;na&quot; &quot;precede&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;people before history&quot; or &quot;ancient people&quot;), are spirits of ancient giant inhabitants believed to protect the mountains and wild places of the Mariana Islands, which include Luta, Saipan, Tinian and Guam, in Micronesia. Belief in Taotao Mo&#x27;na is present throughout these islands.

== Academic accounts==
With the Spanish conquest of Guam in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the resultant destruction of the old way of life of the native Chamorros, went also the practice of ancestor veneration. Early Spanish accounts of Chamorros did not include any mention of Taotao Mo&#x27;na. The concept of Taotao Mo&#x27;na therefore appears to have emerged during the Spanish occupation and was created by the Chamorros who &quot;turned to the memory of their Before Time Ancestors for pride and comfort.&quot; The modern stories of Taotao Mo&#x27;na tend to be simple superstitions in which Taotao Mo&#x27;na are mischievous or monstrous, rather than the complex myths of pre-Contact Chamorros, such as the creation story of the gods Puntan and Fu&#x27;una or the Three Feats of Strength by Chief Gadao.

==Behavior of Taotao Mo&#x27;na==
Despite the modernity of most Chamorros, there is still a healthy respect for Taotao Mo&#x27;na. It is thought that if they are offended, they can cause bad influences in a particular location or towards a particular person. Taotao Mo&#x27;na are believed to inhabit any secluded natural place on the island particularly in the south of the island. Locals and &quot;traditional&quot; Chamorros claim that one must request permission from the Taotao Mo&#x27;na before entering the jungle or taking fruit or wood from it. Another enduring superstition is their dislike of pregnant women. Pregnant Chamorro women are often told to use perfume to mask their scent or to wear their husband&#x27;s clothing, and to stay indoors at night to keep taotaomo&#x27;na away.

Some Taotao Mo&#x27;na are described as being headless and malicious if their land is not respected, while some are said to be gentler spirits who aid local witch doctors, called suruhanas or suruhanus. Taotao Mo&#x27;na have been known to pinch, bruise, imitate voices and kidnap children for short periods of time. People also claim taotaomo&#x27;na can become attached to certain people they like, making them ill - and only a visit to a suruhana can make the spirit go away.

The Taotao Mo&#x27;na were investigated in a segment of the Syfy television show &quot;Destination Truth&quot; entitled &quot;Guam Zombies,&quot; where they were (incorrectly) said to appear as zombie-like; however, the Taotao Mo&#x27;na are not zombies, but ancestral spirits that are said to live within banyan trees. The trees themselves are said to have moving roots that change direction every night.

<text>Charles Owen (&quot;Chuck&quot;) Prince III (born January 13, 1950) is an American corporate executive, banker / financier, and lawyer. He is a former chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer , for the brief period of (2002-2007), of Citigroup financial / banking firm in New York City. He succeeded Sanford I. (&quot;Sandy&quot;) Weill (born 1933), as the chief executive of the financial firm in 2002-2003, and succeeded him also four years later as the subsequent chairman of the board of directors in 2006. On November 4, 2007, he himself retired from both his chairman and chief executive officer duties due to an unexpectedly poor third quarter revenues / profits performance, mainly due to CDO and MBS related losses, while still receiving a $38 million pay package.

==Early life and education==
Charles Owen Prince III was born in Lynwood, California on 13 January 1950 to Charles Owen Prince II and Mary Doyle. Prince went to the University of Southern California and its USC Marshall School of Business in Los Angeles, California, for his Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Juris Doctor (Doctor of Law) academic degrees. He continued his education, going on to receive a Master of Laws degree from Georgetown University Law Center of Georgetown University, in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C..

==Career==
Prince started his career as an attorney with the famous longtime United States Steel Corporation in 1975. Four years later in 1979, he joined the old Commercial Credit Company, a predecessor to Citigroup that Sanford I. (&quot;Sandy&quot;) Weill (born 1933), took over in 1986. He was promoted in 1996 to executive vice president of the firm, which at this point, was known as the Travelers Group. In 2000, shortly following the 1998 merger of the Travelers Group and Citicorp, Prince was named chief administrative officer of the newly created firm, Citigroup. He was subsequently promoted to chief operating officer (COO) in 2001, to chairman and chief executive of Citi Markets and Banking in 2002, and finally to chairman and chief executive officer.

===Credit crisis===
On Sunday, 4 November 2007, Prince resigned from his post as CEO of Citigroup due to the failing mortgage industry. He was replaced by Vikram Pandit (born 1957), as the next CEO of Citigroup, and by former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the 42nd President Bill Clinton administration of Robert Rubin (born 1938, served as Treasury Secretary 1993-2001), as its new chairman of the board of directors.

Prince left with an exit bonus valued at $12.5 million, in addition to the $68 million he received in stock and options he had accumulated during his career, together with a $1.7 million pension, an office, with car and driver for up to five years. During his tenure, the market value of Citigroup dropped by $64 billion. He is still a consultant with Citigroup.

In July 2007, Prince famously said about Citigroup&#x27;s continued commitment to leveraged buy-out deals, despite fears of reduced liquidity because of the occurring sub-prime meltdown: &quot;As long as the music is playing, you&#x27;ve got to get up and dance.&quot;

In 2008, Fortune named Charles Prince as one of eight economic leaders &quot;who didn&#x27;t [see] the crisis coming&quot;, noting his overly optimistic statements in July 2007. In January 2009, Guardian city editor Julia Finch identified him as one of twenty-five people who were at the heart of the financial meltdown.

==Personal life==
Prince is currently married to Margaret L. Wolff. The couple was wed on September 20, 2003, at The Pierre Hotel in New York City. Semi-retired Judge Robert W. Sweet presided over the ceremonies.

==Affiliations==
Prince serves in the influential trade group the Financial Services Forum, as well as a member of the Council of Foreign Relations, the Business Roundtable, and several other organizations. Along with his directorship on the Citigroup board, Prince has served as a member of Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s board since February 13, 2006.

He also serves as a trustee for several education institutions including the Weill Medical College (of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York), but located at Manhattan of New York City, the Teachers College of Columbia University, and The Juilliard School (of music).

Prince formerly was a Senior Counselor to the Albright Stonebridge Group.

<text>National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET; also known by its native acronym SAMPAD) is an Iranian organization founded in 1976 that governs a series of selective schools.

==History==

The organization was founded in the Autumn of 1976 by Iraj Broomand as &quot;National Iranian Organization for Gifted and Talented Education&quot; (&quot;NIOGATE&quot;), with two mixed-gender schools in Tehran (Alvand and Bolvar), with a budget of 13 million tomans. It was to serve as a model of excellence for education in Iran. This innovative organization was short-lived but its influence in the country was significant. Several international and American organizations collaborated with this nascent program, including the University of Southern California and the United Nations Education Commission.

After 1979 Revolution, the organization was continuing its work unofficially, until it was re-established in 1987 as &quot;National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents&quot; (&quot;NODET&quot;; &quot;Sāzmān-e Melli-ye Parvaresh-e Este&#x27;dādhā-ye Derakhshān&quot;, acronym &quot;SAMPAD&quot;).

==Schools==

The organization has 99 middle schools and 98 high schools.

The schools are informally called &quot;Tizhooshan&quot; (, literally &quot;sharp minds&quot;).
The boys schools in Tehran are often named &quot;Allameh Helli&quot; () and the girls schools are often named &quot;Farzanegan&quot; ().

==Entrance==

The organization recruits students annually through a two-step set of nationwide exams at both middle school and high school levels. The tests are designed to measure intelligence, talent and creativity rather than prior knowledge. The rate of acceptance is less than 5% for the thousands of students who apply annually.

The entrance for the educational and administrative staff is also selective. The teachers tend to be the best in the country.

==Education system==

The educational materials, facilities, instructional methodologies, coursework and curriculum are different in these schools, and intended to develop the students&#x27; talents.

The courses are college-level in fields such as biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics and English. The schools usually offer only two majors, mathematics-physics and experimental sciences.

Virtually all medals in the Iranian Science Olympiads are won by the NODET students. The students are also top performers in many International Science Olympiads.

==Alumni==
NODET alumni usually pursue higher education up to postgraduate level.

Some of the alumni are world class researchers in STEM fields and medicine. Notable alumni include the mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani, chess grandmaster Elshan Moradi, computer scientist Farinaz Koushanfar, and Unicode expert Roozbeh Pournader.

<text>József Bozsik (; 28 November 1925 – 31 May 1978) was a Hungarian footballer who played as a central midfielder. He spent his entire club career at his hometown club, Budapest Honvéd. Bozsik was a key member of the legendary Golden Team as he represented Hungary in various international tournaments. Honvéd named their stadium, Bozsik József Stadion, after him.

==Early life==
József Bozsik was born in Kispest, now a district of Budapest. Given the nickname &quot;Cucu&quot; by his grandmother, he grew up playing football on the local football grounds in Kispest with his best friend and neighbour Ferenc Puskás.

==Playing career==
As an 11-year-old, Bozsik attracted the attention of Budapest Honvéd and the club signed him to the youth team. In 1943, he made his debut for the first team against Vasas SC. He made his debut for Hungary at the age of 21 against Bulgaria on 17 August 1947 and went on to win 101 caps and score 11 goals by the time he last played for the national side on 18 April 1962 against Uruguay. He remained the most capped Hungarian player until 2016, when his record was broken by goalkeeper Gábor Király.

Bozsik won the Olympic gold medal with his country in 1952 in Helsinki and finished second with the Hungarian team in the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He also took part in Hungary&#x27;s famous 6–3 win over England at Wembley and the team&#x27;s 7–1 win over England in Budapest.

In 1956–57, Bozsik returned from Honvéd&#x27;s winter tour to play in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. A year later, he won the Mitropa Cup with Honvéd. In all, he played 477 top-level games for KAC (and its legal successor BHSE) and scored 33 goals.

==Style of play==
In his prime, Bozsik was considered one of the best attacking half-backs in the world, possessing good technique, flair, tactical nous, passing accuracy and creativity, although he suffered from a lack of pace. He was often used as a deep lying playmaker where his tackling ability was also helpful. He is considered one of the greatest Hungarian footballers.

==Post-playing career==

Throughout his career, Bozsik won many honours and was even made a Member of Parliament. After his retirement, he became a member of the board at his old club. He also managed the team for 47 matches between January 1966 and September 1967, after which he returned to his position on the board. In 1974, he was chosen to manage the Hungarian national team, but illness forced him to resign soon after he got the job.

==Death==
József Bozsik died in Budapest, aged 52, due to heart failure. He was made a Freeman of Kispest posthumously.

<doc id="1111175" wikidata="Q238102" url="?curid=1111175" title="Magdalena Maleeva">
<text>Magdalena Georgieva Maleeva (, ; born 1 April 1975) is a Bulgarian former professional tennis player. Her best WTA singles ranking was world No. 4. She played on the WTA Tour competing in singles and doubles, from April 1989 to October 2005 and has won ten career singles titles.

==Early life==
Born in Sofia, Maleeva is the youngest of the three children of Yuliya Berberyan and Georgi Maleev. Yuliya, who came from a prominent Armenian family which found refuge in Bulgaria after the 1896 Armenian massacres in the Ottoman Empire, was one of the best Bulgarian tennis players in the 1960s. After she retired from professional tennis in the 1970s, Berberyan started on a coaching career. She trained all of her three daughters, Magdalena, Katerina and Manuela, each of whom eventually became WTA top six players.
==Career==
===Juniors===
In 1988, Maleeva became the youngest ever national tennis champion of Bulgaria, at the age of 13 years and four months. She turned professional in 1989, reaching the final of her first professional tournament (ITF) at Bari. In her Grand Slam debut at the French Open in 1990, she passed the qualifications and reached the third round. In 1990, Maleeva won three junior Grand Slam tournaments at the Australian, French and US Open. 
===Professional===
In 1992, Maleeva snatched her first WTA Tour event victory in San Marino and scored her best Grand Slam tournament result with a quarterfinal run at the US Open, upsetting Martina Navratilova on the way. The following year, she reached the fourth round at the Australian, the French and the US Open, as well as the third round of the Wimbledon Championships. That same year, she was the opponent of Monica Seles at a tournament in Hamburg, Germany when a deranged fan stabbed Seles in the back on the court.

Her best performance at a Grand Slam championship came when she got to the quarterfinals of the 1992 US Open, defeating Kateřina Kroupová-Šišková, Martina Navratilova, Kimberly Po and Chanda Rubin before losing to her older sister Manuela. In 1995, Maleeva won a total of three tournaments, in Moscow, Chicago, Oakland, which saw her hit a career-high ranking of No. 4 in January 1996.

In June 1998, Maleeva underwent shoulder surgery, which forced her off the tour for the next eleven months. She started competing again in May 1999 and re-entered top 20 in 2001. In 2002, she won the prestigious Kremlin Cup in Moscow, defeating three top-10 players on her way (Venus Williams, Amélie Mauresmo, and Lindsay Davenport). In 2004, she married her long-standing boyfriend, Lubomir Nokov.

Maleeva won a career total of ten WTA titles in singles and five in doubles. She was the recipient of the &quot;WTA Most Improved Player 1993&quot; award and was nominated for the &quot;WTA Most Impressive Newcomer 1990&quot;. She participated at the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta, and Athens.

==Life after tennis==
In October 2005, Maleeva retired from professional tennis after 16 seasons (years), and became the last of the Maleeva sisters to retire. She now lives in Sofia. On 27 June 2007, she gave birth to her first child, a girl named Youlia, and on 13 December 2008, she gave birth to a second child, Marko, and on 20 August 2012 to their third child, Nina.

Maleeva has been very active with the environmental organization &#x27;Gorichka.bg&#x27;, which works to create public awareness about urgent environmental problems. She also has created &#x27;Harmonica&#x27;, a brand for organic foods, as well as a couple of organic food stores in Sofia under the brand &#x27;Biomag &#x27;. She is also a partner at the Maleeva Tennis Club.

In October 2010, Maleeva won the Bulgarian national outdoor championship, becoming the youngest and the oldest player to have won it, within 22 years. In 2011, she made a brief tennis comeback, playing and winning three doubles matches for Bulgaria at the Fed Cup.

In March 2011, Maleeva was voted eighth in the &quot;100 most influential women in Bulgaria&quot; by Pari newspaper. She has also appeared at Wimbledon&#x27;s ladies&#x27; invitation doubles event on several occasions, achieving her best result in 2015, where she partnered Rennae Stubbs; the pair defeated Navratilova and Selima Sfar in the final to win the title.

In February 2024, she was nominated as the captain of the Bulgarian BJK Cup team.

<doc id="1111187" wikidata="Q379433" url="?curid=1111187" title="Operation Ten-Go">
<text>, also known as Operation Heaven One (or Ten-ichi-gō 天一号), was the last major Japanese naval operation in the Pacific Theater of World War II. In April 1945, the , the largest battleship in the world, and nine other Japanese warships, embarked from Japan for a suicide attack on Allied forces engaged in the Battle of Okinawa. The Japanese force was attacked by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft before it could reach Okinawa; &quot;Yamato&quot; and five other Japanese warships were sunk. 

The battle demonstrated U.S. air supremacy in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater and the vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack. The battle also exhibited Japan&#x27;s willingness to make extreme sacrifices in &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks aimed at delaying the Allied advance upon the Japanese home islands.

Furthermore, the engagement was also paramount by enabling U.S. forces to prevent Japan from holding a significant advantage over the Allies at Okinawa. The designation of &quot;Yamato&quot; as a beached fortification against Allied aerial and naval bombardment of Okinawa would have become detrimental towards the invading armies, in that, alike to Operation Downfall, the anticipated losses would have substantially increased for maritime combatants at large, likewise with surrounding infantry support. It is generally accepted amongst historians that the prior removal of &quot;Yamato&quot; from the scene was a preliminary objective of the Allies before any further assaults.

==Background==
By early 1945, following the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the once-formidable Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Combined Fleet was reduced to just a handful of operational warships and a few remaining aircraft and aircrew. Most of the remaining Japanese warships in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan, with most of the large ships at the port of Kure in the Hiroshima Prefecture on the main Japanese island of Honshu.

As a final step before the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April 1945. In March, when briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan&#x27;s response to the expected invasion of Okinawa, Japanese military leaders explained that the Imperial Japanese Army was planning extensive air attacks, including the use of &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactics. The emperor then reportedly asked, &quot;But what about the Navy? What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?&quot; Feeling pressured by the emperor to mount some kind of attack, Japanese Navy commanders conceived a &quot;kamikaze&quot;-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship .

The resulting plan, drafted under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, called for &quot;Yamato&quot; and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting troops landing on the western coast of Okinawa. &quot;Yamato&quot; and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crew members were supposed to abandon ship and fight on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from U.S. carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, on 29 March the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, off the port of Mitajiri on the southern coast of Honshu. Despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, the commander of the &quot;Ten-Go&quot; force, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō, still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.

Other officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy also had very negative views about the operation, believing that it was a waste of human life and fuel. Captain Atsushi Ōi, an operations officer at Grand Escort Command, was critical as fuel and resources were diverted from other operations. As he was told that the aim of this operation was &quot;the tradition and the glory of the Navy,&quot; he shouted: &quot;this war is of our nation and why should the honor of our &#x27;surface fleet&#x27; be more respected? Who cares about their glory? Damn fools!&quot;.

Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka flew from Tokyo to Tokuyama on 5 April in a final attempt to convince Itō and the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet to accept the plan. Upon hearing of the proposed operation—which had been kept secret from most of them—the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Itō in rejecting it for the same reasons that he had expressed. Kusaka then explained that the Navy&#x27;s attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army&#x27;s planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan&#x27;s national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.

Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and accepted the proposed plan. The ships&#x27; crews were briefed on the nature of the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind if desired; none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm were ordered off the ships, including 67 naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships&#x27; crews engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing damage control procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave &quot;Yamato&quot; and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. &quot;Yamato&quot;″s executive officer organised a party for the crew for the evening of 5 April, during which many of the officers and sailors drank heavily.

The United States Navy was able to monitor preparations for Operation Ten-Go by decoding Japanese radio signals. Through this source, the Americans received conclusive intelligence on 5 and 6 April that the attack was to be attempted. Admiral Raymond Spruance, commander of the United States Fifth Fleet, ordered his forces to prepare to attack the Japanese at 00:30 on 6 April, before &quot;Yamato&quot; and her escorts sailed.

==Prelude==

At 16:00 on 6 April, &quot;Yamato&quot; (with Admiral Itō on board), the light cruiser , and eight destroyers (, , , , , , , and ) departed Tokuyama to begin the mission. Two American submarines, and , sighted the Japanese force as it proceeded south through the Bungo Channel. Although they were unable to attack because of the ships&#x27; speed, they did spend several hours shadowing the Japanese sortie and sending updates on its course to the U.S. fleet. The submarines&#x27; messages, which were reportedly sent uncoded, were also picked up by radio operators on the Japanese ships.

At dawn on 7 April, the Japanese force passed the Ōsumi Peninsula into the open ocean heading south from Kyūshū toward Okinawa. They shifted into a defensive formation, with &quot;Yahagi&quot; leading &quot;Yamato&quot; and the eight destroyers deployed in a ring around the two larger ships, with each ship from each other and proceeding at . The destroyer &quot;Asashimo&quot; developed engine trouble and turned back. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft began to shadow the main force of ships. At 10:00, the force turned west to make it look like they were withdrawing, but at 11:30, after being detected by two American PBM Mariner flying boats, the &quot;Yamato&quot; fired a salvo with her bow guns using special but could not prevent the two planes from shadowing. The forces then turned back towards Okinawa.

Upon receiving contact reports early on 7 April, Spruance ordered Task Force 54, which consisted mostly of modernized Standard-type battleships under the command of Rear Admiral Morton Deyo (which were engaged in shore bombardment), to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie. Deyo moved to execute his orders, but Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, who commanded Task Force 58, preempted Spruance and Deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers, without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed. As a senior naval aviation officer, &quot;Mitscher had spent a career fighting the battleship admirals who had steered the navy’s thinking for most of the current century. One of those was his immediate superior, Raymond Spruance. Mitscher felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry. Though the carriers had mostly fought the great battles of the Pacific, whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt. Here was an opportunity to end the debate forever&quot;.

Around 10:00 on 7 April, Task Groups 58.1 and 58.3 began launching 280 aircraft from their carriers. Task Group 58.4 launched a further 106 aircraft. The aircraft consisted of F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters, SB2C Helldiver dive bombers, and TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. Overall, 15 carriers launched aircraft. The air groups launched from five carriers became lost in bad weather and were not able to attack. As a contingency, Spruance ordered Deyo to assemble a force of six fast battleships, seven cruisers and 21 destroyers to prepare for a surface engagement with &quot;Yamato&quot; should the airstrikes prove unsuccessful.

==Battle==

Around noon, the first American aircraft arrived over &quot;Yamato&quot;; these were F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters conducting a fighter sweep of any Japanese aircraft defending the battle group; however, the severely depleted Imperial Japanese Army Air Force could muster no opposition, which allowed U.S. dive-bomber and torpedo aircraft to set up for their attacks unmolested. These aircraft—after a two-hour flight from Okinawa—arrived over the &quot;Yamato&quot; battle group and circled the ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range; the lack of Japanese fighter resistance provided ample breathing room for American crews to methodically plan and coordinate their attack runs. 

The first wave of U.S. carrier planes was spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, at 12:34, &quot;Yamato&quot; opened fire with her 460 mm main batteries. The ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , began taking evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. &quot;Yamato&quot; carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460 mm main guns that fired San Shiki anti-aircraft shells. The U.S. pilots deduced that the use of San Shiki and colored gunfire meant that &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; gunners relied on visual aiming and range, rather than being radar directed, and as a result &quot;were missing with great consistency&quot; despite the storm of fire that they put up.

The Hellcat and Corsair fighters &quot;were supposed to go first, to strafe, to rocket, to drop light ordnance, distracting the enemy gunners while the Helldivers plunged almost straight down with their heavy [armor piercing] bombs&quot;. This was because the Avenger torpedo bombers &quot;needed all the distraction and diversion they could get when they made their dangerous low altitude runs straight at the enemy ships.&quot; The Avengers mainly attacked from the port side so that if the torpedoes hit that side, it would increase the likelihood of the target ship capsizing.
At 12:46, a torpedo hit &quot;Yahagi&quot; directly in her engine room, killing the entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop. &quot;Yahagi&quot; was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks. The destroyer &quot;Isokaze&quot; attempted to come to &quot;Yahagi&quot;″s aid but was attacked and heavily damaged and sank sometime later. &quot;Yahagi&quot; capsized and sank at 14:05.

During the first attack wave, despite evasive maneuvers that caused most of the bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss, &quot;Yamato&quot; was hit by two armor-piercing bombs and one torpedo. Her speed was not affected, but one of the bombs started a fire aft of the superstructure that was not extinguished. Also, during the first attack wave, destroyers &quot;Hamakaze&quot; and &quot;Suzutsuki&quot; were heavily damaged and taken out of the battle. &quot;Hamakaze&quot; sank later.

Between 13:20 and 14:15, the second and third waves of U.S. aircraft attacked, concentrating on &quot;Yamato&quot;. During this time, &quot;Yamato&quot; was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs. The bombs did extensive damage to the topside of the ship, including knocking out power to the gun directors and forcing the anti-aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired, greatly reducing their effectiveness. The torpedo hits—almost all on the port side—caused &quot;Yamato&quot; to list enough that capsizing was an imminent danger.

At 13:33, in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from capsizing, &quot;Yamato&quot;″s damage control team counter-flooded both starboard engine and boiler rooms. This narrowly mitigated the imminent danger of capsizing but also drowned the several hundred crew members crewing those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water. The loss of the starboard engines, plus the weight of the water, caused &quot;Yamato&quot; to slow to about . At that same moment, another 110 aircraft were launched from Task Group 58. Twenty Avengers made a torpedo run from 60 degrees to port. Yamato started a sharp turn to port, but three torpedoes ripped into her port side amidships, jamming her auxiliary rudder in position hard port.

With &quot;Yamato&quot; proceeding more slowly and therefore being more accessible to target, U.S. torpedo aircraft concentrated on hitting her rudder and stern with torpedoes to affect her steering ability, which they succeeded in doing. At 14:02, after being informed that the ship could no longer steer and was sinking, Itō ordered the mission canceled, the crew to abandon the ship and the remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors. &quot;Yamato&quot; communicated this message to the other surviving ships by signal flag because her radios had been destroyed.
Itō, along with Captain Kōsaku Aruga, who commanded &quot;Yamato&quot; for the battle, refused to abandon ship, with Itō retiring to the flag cabin while Aruga tied himself to the binnacle. As the order to abandon the ship was issued after the ship began to capsize, many of her crew were trapped. American aircraft continued to attack &quot;Yamato&quot; during this period, and she suffered several more torpedo hits. At 14:20, &quot;Yamato&quot; capsized completely and began to sink (). At 14:23, she suddenly blew up with an explosion so large that it was reportedly heard and seen away in Kagoshima and sent up a mushroom-shaped cloud almost into the air. Japanese survivor Mitsuru Yoshida said that her large explosion downed several U.S. planes observing her end. The explosion is believed to have occurred when the fires ignited by bomb hits reached the main magazines.

Attempting to make it back to port, the destroyer was bombed and sunk with no survivors. The destroyer was also crippled and had to be scuttled by other, relatively undamaged destroyers. &quot;Suzutsuki&quot; was able to make it to Sasebo, Japan, despite her bow being blown off, by steaming in reverse the entire way.

The remaining three less-damaged destroyers (&quot;Fuyutsuki&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, and &quot;Hatsushimo&quot;) were able to rescue 280 survivors from &quot;Yamato&quot; (sources differ on the size of &quot;Yamato&quot;″s crew, giving it as between 2,750 and 3,300 men), plus 555 survivors from &quot;Yahagi&quot; (out of a crew of 1,000) and just over 800 survivors from &quot;Isokaze&quot;, &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, and &quot;Kasumi&quot;. Between 3,700 and 4,250 Japanese naval personnel perished in the battle. The ships took the survivors to Sasebo.
A total of 10 U.S. aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. The U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft strafed Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the destroyers during the time that the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.

===Aerial kamikaze attacks===
During the battle, as promised, the Japanese Army conducted an air attack on the U.S. naval fleet at Okinawa, but they failed to sink any ships. Around 115 aircraft—many of them &quot;kamikazes&quot;—attacked the U.S. ships throughout 7 April. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; aircraft hit the aircraft carrier , battleship , and destroyer , causing moderate damage to &quot;Hancock&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot; and severe damage to &quot;Bennett&quot;. About 100 Japanese aircraft were lost in the attack.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Ten-Go&quot; was the last major Japanese naval operation of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations for the rest of the conflict. &quot;Suzutsuki&quot; was never repaired. &quot;Fuyutsuki&quot; was repaired but hit a U.S. air-dropped mine at Moji, Japan, on 20 August 1945, and was not subsequently repaired. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; survived the war almost undamaged. &quot;Hatsushimo&quot; hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945, near Maizuru, Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war.

&quot;Maryland&quot; was kept out of the war following the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Okinawa was declared secure by Allied forces on 21 June 1945, after an intense and costly battle. Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the USSR launching an invasion of northern China and Korea. The apparent willingness of Japan to sacrifice so many of its people using suicidal tactics such as Operation Ten-Go and in the Battle of Okinawa was reportedly a factor in the American decision to employ atomic weapons against Japan.

&quot;Yamato&quot; remains fairly prominent in modern Japanese culture, where she is often portrayed as a symbol of Japanese nationalism. The academic Robert Farley has written that popular depictions of the battleship portray her destruction as a &quot;heroic, but also pointless and futile, sacrifice&quot;. One of the reasons the event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word &quot;Yamato&quot; was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; could serve as a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire, amidst her allegorical greatest might.

<text>American Public Media Group (APMG), formerly the Minnesota Communications Group, is the non-profit parent organization of Minnesota Public Radio, American Public Media, and Southern California Public Radio. Jean Taylor is APMG&#x27;s President and CEO.

==History==
===Minnesota Communications Group===

In the second quarter 1998, Minnesota Communications Group and Greenspring Company approved the sale of Greenspring&#x27;s catalog sales business, Rivertown Trading, to Dayton Hudson for $120 million. $90 million of the sale price would go into MPR&#x27;s endowment fund, which then totaled only $19 million. Greenspring President Bill Kling and two other top executives received $7.3 million of proceeds via a &quot;value participation unit&quot; plan. Rivertown Trading started with a Prairie Home Companion–inspired &quot;Powder milk Biscuit&quot; poster order form in 1981.

===American Public Media Group===
American Public Media Group sold Greenspring Media Group, a for-profit publishing company, to Hour Media LLC in July 2013 as Greenspring was losing money. On August 27, 2014, APMG launched its podcasting network, Infinite Guest, with 12 shows, three existing APM programs, a MPR Classical program, two independent podcasts and six new ones. It is now called APM Podcasts

APMG began a series of radio station acquisition in Florida that ended up being its Classical South Florida (CSF) station group costing $30 million which was mostly paid for using bonds. APMG purchased WKCP in 2007 from Trinity International Foundation for $20 million. From Barry University in 2011, APMG purchased WPBI-FM in West Palm Beach for $4 million. With in a year, Way Media sold WNPS-FM in Fort Myers to APMG for $4.3 million. The subsidiary was losing $1 million per year. Educational Media Foundation offered $21.7 million in May 2015 for the stations. A large number of CSF&#x27;s board directors resigned at APMG&#x27;s acceptance of the offer before consulting the CSF board and that other purchaser could have been found for the stations. The sale closed in July 2015 leaving APMG with $8 million in bond debt over the sale price. The classical music on CSF was moved online to YourClassical.org the week of July 14, 2015, with CSF ceasing broadcasting. Educational Media Foundation&#x27;s Christian programming began broadcasting while awaiting FCC approval.

== Subsidiaries ==
The American Public Media Group operates several sub-organizations, including:
* Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), a public radio network in Minnesota
* American Public Media (APM), program producer and distributor
* Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), a public radio network in Southern California
* Public Radio Market, an Amazon.com affiliate

== Finances ==
American Public Media Group receives substantial financial support from the Lumina Foundation to provide coverage of education-related issues that are of interest to the Lumina Foundation and its frequent partner in education policy initiatives, the Gates Foundation. Critics have suggested that this funding may lead to biased coverage and have noted the Lumina Foundation&#x27;s connections to the private student loan company Sallie Mae. Lumina-funding of the American Public Media Group is not always disclosed in education press coverage or in coverage of white papers, articles, or editorials by other Lumina or Gates Foundation grantees, such as the New America Foundation.

In 2004, the combined revenue of APMG and MPR was US$84.9 million, making it the largest non-profit in Minnesota&#x27;s arts and culture sector.

<text>The 68HC12 (also abbreviated as 6812 or HC12) is a microcontroller family from Motorola Semiconductor (later from Freescale then NXP). Originally introduced in the mid-1990s, the architecture is an enhancement of the Freescale 68HC11. Programs written for the HC11 are usually compatible with the HC12, which has a few extra instructions. The first 68HC12 derivatives had a maximum bus speed of 8 MHz and flash memory sizes up to 128 KB.

==Architecture==
Like the 68HC11, the 68HC12 has two 8-bit accumulators A and B (referred to as a single 16-bit accumulator, D, when A &amp; B are cascaded so as to allow for operations involving 16 bits), two 16-bit registers X and Y, a 16-bit program counter, a 16-bit stack pointer and an 8-bit Condition Code Register. Unlike the 68HC11 the processor has 16bit internal data paths

The 68HC12 adds to and replaces a small number of 68HC11 instructions with new forms that are closer to the 6809 processor. More significantly it changes the instruction encodings to be far more dense and adds many 6809 like indexing features, some with even more flexibility. The net result is that code sizes are typically 30% smaller.

==HCS12/MC9S12 derivatives==
Beginning in 2000 the family was extended with the introduction of the MC9S12 derivatives which have bus speeds of up to 25 MHz and flash sizes up to 512 KB.

The MC9S12NE64 was introduced by Freescale in September 2004, claiming to be the &quot;industry&#x27;s first single-chip fast-Ethernet Flash microcontroller.&quot; It features a 25 MHz HCS12 CPU, 64 KB of FLASH EEPROM, 8 KB of RAM, and an Ethernet 10/100 Mbit/s controller.

==MC9S12X derivatives==
The MC9S12XDP512 which was introduced in 2004 has a bus speed of 40 MHz and a peripheral co-processor known as the XGATE which allows for some tasks to be offloaded from the CPU. The CPU of the S12X derivative also features several new instructions to increase performance.

Freescale announced the MC9S12XEP100 in May 2006 to further extend the S12X family to 50 MHz bus speed and add a Memory protection unit (based on segmentation) and a hardware scheme to provide emulated EEPROM.

HCS12 products contain a single processor, the HCS12X feature the additional XGATE peripheral processor.

The S12X family offer two main methods to address more than 64KBytes.
* Paged memory regions in the 64 KB local map: PPAGE for paged program data, RPAGE for paged RAM, EPAGE for paged EEPROM/flash
* Global addressing permits access to any addresses in the 8 MB address space. GPAGE is used in conjunction with special opcodes. (gldaa etc.)

== XGATE ==
The XGATE co-processor is a 16-bit RISC processor operating at twice the main bus clock. It offloads work from the S12X core by handling interrupts only and does not run a background loop. The first versions of the XGATE do not allow for higher priority interrupts to pre-empt a currently handled interrupt, but the &quot;XGATEV3&quot; as featured in the 9S12XEP100 (and others) does allow this. The S12X can trigger software interrupts on the XGATE core and vice versa. A semaphore system is implemented to allow the S12X and XGATE cores to synchronize access to peripherals.

Typically the XGATE code is copied to RAM at device startup and then executed from RAM for a speed benefit. The XGATE has a partial 64KByte address space with no paging. The registers share addresses, but the flash and RAM appear at different addresses between the cores. (See the datasheet for more details.)

<text>The Naval Academy Preparatory School or NAPS is the preparatory school for the United States Naval Academy (USNA). NAPS is located on Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. The mission of the Naval Academy Preparatory School is &quot;To enhance Midshipman Candidates&#x27; moral, mental, and physical foundations to prepare them for success at the United States Naval Academy&quot;.

==History==
The Naval Academy Preparatory School is the Navy&#x27;s fourth oldest school; only the Naval War College, the Naval Postgraduate School, and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland are older. Informal preparatory classes began as early as 1915.

In 1918, the Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels signed a provision to have up to 100 sailors from the fleet to be eligible for entry to the Academy. Due to the difficult nature of the Naval Academy&#x27;s entrance examination, then Undersecretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt (future 32nd President) also allowed for a school to be founded to prepare Sailors and Marines for entry.

The first official classes were established at Naval Station, Newport in Rhode Island and Naval Station Treasure Island / San Francisco in California in 1920. A year later the schools were moved to Norfolk, Virginia and San Diego, California. San Diego classes were later disestablished and NAPS classes remained solely in Norfolk until 1942, when the new Naval Academy Preparatory School opened in Newport, Rhode Island.

In early 1943, NAPS moved to the United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge, a facility of several hundred acres located above the Susquehanna River in Port Deposit, Maryland at the former Tome School campus, some northeast of Baltimore, Maryland. NAPS returned to Newport while the Bainbridge Center was temporarily inactive during 15 months around 1950. When Bainbridge was reactivated in 1951 because of the Korean War, the preparatory school returned to Maryland. In August 1974, NAPS returned to its permanent home in Newport and in 2006, named their newly built dormitory in honor of alumnus Colonel John Ripley

From 1915 to 1968 NAPS was exclusively for Sailors and Marines who were of &quot;Officer Caliber&quot; but lacked the academic foundation for the rigors at the USNA. In 1968, the first male &quot;Direct Entries&quot; were admitted to NAPS. Following the congressional authorization of women to attend all military service academies, women were admitted in 1976.

Although NAPS primarily serves as an institution to prepare midshipman candidates to attend the USNA; from the years 1958 to 2008 it also began to prepare cadet candidates for the United States Air Force Academy (1958–1961) and the United States Coast Guard Academy (1979–2008, 2016–present) and, midshipman candidates for the United States Merchant Marine Academy (1991 to 2004).
==Admissions==
Admission to NAPS is based on application to USNA; USNA may offer assignment to NAPS to some applicants who otherwise would be accepted but require additional academic preparation and will be no younger than 17 years of age and not yet 23 years of age when NAPS Indoctrination begins. (The same is true for a small number applications via the United States Coast Guard.) 

To gain admission to their respective academies upon graduation, midshipman/cadet candidates must have a grade point average (GPA) above 2.2, no failing grade in any subject, meet the body fat standards, pass the USNA&#x27;s Physical Readiness Test (PRT), improving or sustained course grades and SAT scores, favorable conduct and honor aptitude, and get a favorable recommendation from the Commanding Officer.

Midshipman candidates who might be below the standard may still have a chance of admission to the USNA. After finals are over, their fate is decided on a day known as Black Monday.

==Organization==

The student body, organized as a battalion, is divided into three companies, which are then divided into two platoons. Each platoon is divided into four squads in order to carry out orders with effective results. While attending NAPS, all midshipman candidates, affectionately known as &quot;NAPSters&quot;, are on active duty military status, holding the rank of Midshipman Candidate, equivalent to the Navy&#x27;s Seaman Recruit, at the enlisted pay grade of E-1, although this is significantly reduced in an effort to allocate funds into the Battalion Activity Fund (BAF) and to pay off all debts owed due for issued uniforms and miscellaneous items. The BAF is used to pay for physical fitness clothing and equipment, textbooks and various student activity expenses, such as the Army-Navy game, Graduation Ball and the like.

Within the battalion there exists a midshipman candidate-led chain of command. Those holding positions of authority are called &quot;stripers&quot;, because they wear collar devices with the number of stripes that are assigned to each position. Stripers are selected by the senior military staff and serve the term of one marking period, after which they rotate out with new midshipmen candidates. The responsibilities of stripers are: delegating orders from the senior military staff to the students, taking accountability of the battalion, writing the watchbill for other students, organizing their respective companies and platoons for each event the midshipmen candidates attend, and maintaining general cleanliness of Ripley Hall. The head of the entire battalion is the Battalion Commander, Battalion Executive Officer (XO), and MA. The Battalion XO is in charge of Taps sheets, a nightly process that ensures all midshipman/cadet candidates are accounted.

==Athletics==
NAPS athletics consist of football, lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, baseball, wrestling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country running. Most of the athletes will move on to their respective sports at either the USNA or the USCGA after successful completion of their year at NAPS. Midshipmen candidates that are not on any of the school teams, as well as athletes during their sports off-season, must participate in daily physical training. Each midshipman candidate will take the USNA&#x27;s Physical Readiness Test (PRT), four times throughout the school year. The midshipman candidate must pass the PRT in order to move on to the USNA or the USCGA.

In 1998, a NAPS platoon created the chant I believe that we will win! and used it at NAPS sporting events. Those NAPSters then brought the chant with them to the USNA where the cheer team adopted it for its sporting events.

<doc id="1111223" wikidata="Q1213701" url="?curid=1111223" title="The Salute of the Jugger">
<text>The Salute of the Jugger (also released as The Blood of Heroes in the United States) is a 1989 post-apocalyptic film written and directed by David Webb Peoples, produced by Charles Roven, and starring Rutger Hauer, Joan Chen, and Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio. The film has inspired the creation of the sport Jugger.

==Plot==
In a barren world caused by wars waged in the 20th century and now forgotten, most live from hand to mouth in enclaves known as &quot;market-towns&quot; or &quot;dog-towns&quot;, scrounging out a bare subsistence harvesting hardy crops, raising dogs as food, and trading in trinkets from the past.

What little entertainment exists comes primarily from a brutal sport known as The Game. It is played by bands of roving teams known as juggs, who challenge local teams. They might be considered professional athletes, as they make their living through the tribute paid by the town people, should they defeat the local team. Their trophy is the dog skull from the town. The Game involves two armoured teams of five attempting to score by placing a dog skull on the opposing team&#x27;s goalpost. One unarmed player—the &quot;quick&quot;—runs with the skull while being protected by his/her teammates from attack by the opposing team.

However, not all in this time live so sparsely. The Nine Cities, buried deep underground, are home to affluent and powerful members of the aristocracy. Each of The Nine Cities fields its own team of juggs in an organization known as The League, and its membership is maintained with a fresh stream of new players who are proven veterans of the travelling &quot;dog-town&quot; games by their collection of trophy skulls.

Members of The League live in luxury almost equal to that of aristocrats. It is a dream among roving juggs to be good enough to get The League&#x27;s attention and, with it, all of the luxuries afforded a League player.

The team consists of Sallow (Rutger Hauer), Dog-Boy (Justin Monjo), Mbulu (Delroy Lindo), Big Cimber (Anna Katarina), and Young Gar (Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio).

Sallow, the team leader, has played in the League of the Nine Cities before, but was cast out because of his indiscretions with an Overlord&#x27;s daughter. Kidda (Joan Chen), an ambitious peasant girl, joins the team after a game in her dog town where she virtually destroyed her competition. She and Gar inspire Sallow to challenge The League and expunge his past.

But Kidda and Gar do not realise that the City games are for much more than honour and victory, they will need to fight for their very survival. The Game is played much harder and meaner in the Nine Cities.

After having their challenge accepted, the team have to face against an all-star line up of the best in the league, with the league team having been told to focus on neutralizing Sallow, and destroying the team. However, Kidda is able to hold her own against the league quick, and Big Climber is able to hold on and survive despite severe injuries.

Having survived the first round, something no challenger team has ever done, the team must go into the second round seemingly with a man down, as Big Climber is unable to continue. However the team manager, Gandhi, agrees to step on.

Gandhi is able to subdue one of the league players, and the team is able to beat the league team, something that has never happened. Sallow tells Kidda to &quot;walk&quot; to place the skull on the pole, as the crowd cheers.

Following the match, league reps are seen approaching Kidda. In the international version, Kidda and Gar are seen participating in the league and winning, while Sallow and the rest of the team have gone back to playing in the wastelands.

==Production==

&quot;The Salute of the Jugger&quot; was shot in the desert of Coober Pedy, Australia.

==Alternate cuts==
The US theatrical version of the film was significantly shorter than the original version released overseas. About ten minutes were cut. The biggest difference is in the ending. In the American release, the credits roll shortly after the climax, even though picture continues to roll, showing certain conversations with music covering the dialogue. In the longer cut, there are denouement scenes.

The US DVD release of the film matches the US theatrical cut in being much shorter than the original film. Full versions were released on VHS in the early 1990s in Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan. Various distributors began releasing the original cut on DVD in early 2001, known as the extended version or by the title &quot;Salute to the Jugger&quot;.

In 2017, a 2-disc Blu-ray set with both cuts of the film was released in Japan.

<text>The Oman national football team () represents Oman in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Oman Football Association.

==History==
===World Cup and Asian Cup===
The Oman national football team has made notable efforts in international competitions but has not qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Their best performance in the Asian Cup was reaching the quarterfinals in 2019. The team has shown improvement over the years, and their participation in various qualifiers and tournaments reflects their growing competitiveness in regional football.

===Gulf Cup===
The mid-1990s under the OFA chairmanship of Sheikh Saif bin Hashil Al-Maskary saw Oman achieve positive results on the Asian stage. Former Omani captain, Hani Al-Dhabit was awarded the RSSSF 2001 World Top Scorer, with 22 goals; the most goals scored by a player who won the World Top Scorer award and being the third Arab and the first Omani to win the award.

In the 2002 Arabian Gulf Cup which was held in Saudi Arabia, Oman finished in 5th place and under the captaincy of Dhofar&#x27;s Hani Al-Dhabit, Oman defeated 9-time winners Kuwait. The match had ended 3–1 with captain Al-Dhabit scoring a hat-trick. Hani netted a goal against Bahrain and a consolation goal in a 2–1 loss against Qatar. At the end of the tournament, Hani was the only Omani to score goals for his nation and was awarded for being the top goal scorer of the competition, with 5 goals.

In the 2004 Arabian Gulf Cup which was held in Doha, Oman reached the final for the first time in the team&#x27;s history which was eventually lost to the hosts Qatar in a penalty shootout after the goalkeeping sensation Ali Al-Habsi missed a penalty. Qatar won the match 6–5 on penalties after the match had ended 1–1 at normal time. Amad Al-Hosni was awarded the &quot;Top Goalscorer&quot; award of the tournament with a total of 4 goals.

In the 2007 Arabian Gulf Cup which was held in United Arab Emirates, the team reached the final for a second consecutive time and lost 1–0 to the hosts United Arab Emirates. It had maintained an undefeated record throughout the competition excluding the final. Ali Al-Habsi had received the &quot;Best Goalkeeper of the Gulf Cup&quot; award for the third consecutive time in a row, the most won by any goalkeeper in the 40 years of the Gulf Cup tournament. Oman had tied United Arab Emirates in goal-scoring with 9 goals each after the tournament.

After losing twice in the Gulf Cup final consecutively, Oman won the 2009 Arabian Gulf Cup tournament as hosts by defeating Saudi Arabia in a penalty shootout. Oman won the match 6–5 on penalties after the match had ended 0–0 at extra time. Oman maintained a clean-sheet throughout the tournament. The tournament in Muscat was the first for Hassan Rabia, who managed to score 4 goals making him receive the &quot;Top Goalscorer&quot; award. Ali Al-Habsi received his fourth consecutive &quot;Best Goalkeeper Award&quot;.

==Kit==

The team signed a contract in 2006 with Gulf Air. 

On 9 May 2012, the Oman Football Association launched the new official team kit to be worn by Oman in their push for 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC fourth round. The kit was launched together with a new OFA logo. The new kit was designed for Oman by Taj Oman, an Oman-based company. Later in June 2012, Oman&#x27;s airline Oman Air became the official carrier of the Oman Football Association.

On 8 February 2014, the Omani Football Association confirmed the tie-up with Italian sports apparel manufacturer Kappa. A joint venture agreement was signed by sportswear Kappa and OFA&#x27;s apparel brand Taj Oman. In a 4-year deal, Kappa will produce the kit worn by all the Oman National football teams bearing the Taj mark and will provide Oman with a range of sportswear specific for the country. The deal will see both the names (Kappa &amp; Taj) on the kit worn by the National teams and on all retail items. Oman Air also renewed its deal on the same day with the OFA till the end of the 2013–14 season. On 16 September 2014, the Omani Football Association announced that they had signed an agreement with Asia Sports Marketing to become the exclusive sales agent for the Association. 

On 9 September 2015, the Omani Football Association signed a 1-year contract extension with Oman Air as the official carrier of the team. The association said that although Oman Air&#x27;s ticket allocation in the deal is primarily meant for the senior national team&#x27;s tours, OFA has availed the privilege for club teams&#x27; trips to Salalah for Omantel Professional League (OPL) matches and for overseas travel of the national age-group squads. On 18 October 2015, the Omani Football Association announced a partnership with a new mental energizer Energy Drinks Partner, &quot;Effect&quot;.

<doc id="1111233" wikidata="Q5659366" url="?curid=1111233" title="Harmonium (Adams)">
<text>Harmonium is a composition for chorus and orchestra by the American composer John Adams, written in 1980-1981 for the first season of Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The work is based on poetry by John Donne and Emily Dickinson and is regarded as one of the key compositions of Adams&#x27; &quot;minimalist&quot; period.

The work was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus, with conductor Edo de Waart, on 15 April 1981, and subsequently recorded it. The UK premiere was on 13 October 1987 at Birmingham Town Hall, with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) conducted by Simon Rattle. Rattle and the CBSO gave the London premiere on 28 July 1990 at The Proms.

== Music ==


Each movement is a setting of an entire poem:

&quot;Because I could not stop for Death&quot; ends with an orchestral interlude that segues into &quot;Wild Nights&quot; without a pause. A typical performance takes about 35 minutes.

Timothy Johnson has discussed various aspects of the harmonic language of &quot;Harmonium&quot; in detail. K. Robert Schwarz has noted the influence of the musical techniques of Steve Reich on &quot;Harmonium&quot;, and also has commented on the less schematic and more &quot;intuitive&quot; manner of Adams&#x27; composition in the work.

&quot;Negative Love&quot; is featured in the film &quot;Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol&quot; (1990).

<text>Yuva ( Youth) is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language political drama film written, produced, and directed by Mani Ratnam&quot;.&quot; It starred Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Rani Mukerji, Kareena Kapoor, and Esha Deol. It was simultaneously shot in Tamil as &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot; also starring Deol, but with a completely different cast.

At the 50th Filmfare Awards, &quot;Yuva&quot; won a leading six awards, including Best Film (Critics), Best Supporting Actor (Bachchan), and Best Supporting Actress (Mukerji). &quot;Yuva&quot; was also a breakthrough for Bachchan as he won the Stardust Award for Actor of the Year – Male for his performance.

==Plot==
The film begins with Lallan Singh (Abhishek Bachchan) shooting Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Mukherjee (Ajay Devgn) on his bike, resulting in him falling off the Vidyasagar Setu into the water below, which is witnessed by Arjun Balachandran (Vivek Oberoi). The film then unveils the characters&#x27; pre-incident flashbacks.

Lallan is a goon, originally from Bihar but settled in Kolkata, West Bengal, because his brother Gopal Singh (Sonu Sood) has left him alone and he has no option of earning money back home. He loves, marries, and abuses his wife, Shashi Biswas (Rani Mukerji). He gets into a contract under Gopal&#x27;s recommendation to run errands and work as a hitman for Prosenjit Bhattacharya (Om Puri), a politician.

Michael is an influential student leader who wants politicians like Prosenjit to keep away from college elections. His closest associates are his best friends Vishnu (Karthik Kumar) and Trilok (Abhinav Kashyap). Among the two, Vishnu acts as a right-hand man to Michael. Michael, in his personal life, is in love with his neighbour Radhika (Esha Deol), who lives with her uncle and aunt. Prosenjit is worried when he hears news of students standing in the election. He uses every possible way to get them out of politics. First, he provides a scholarship to a prestigious foreign university to Michael. When Michael refuses the bribe, he orders his goon, Gopal, to take control. Gopal orders Lallan to beat up Trilok, which he does, but faces very strong retaliation from Michael and his fellow students.

Arjun Balachandran (Vivek Oberoi) is the carefree and spoiled son of an IAS officer. He wants to relocate to the U.S. for a better future. He falls in love with Meera (Kareena Kapoor), whom he just met. Arjun asks Meera for coffee, takes her to the beach, and realizes that Meera loves him back. One day, Arjun proposes to Meera, prompting her to playfully avoid him by getting into a taxi. Arjun gets a lift from Michael, who is travelling in the same direction to catch up with Meera, who is going that way. Suddenly, Michael is hit by three bullets (shot by Lallan) and falls off the bridge. He is critically injured but is saved by Arjun and Meera.

Lallan finds out that Michael is recovering from his injuries, and this is witnessed by Arjun, who follows him to apprehend him, only for Lallan to beat him up badly and leave him with a broken arm. After staying by his side until his recovery, Arjun changes his mind and joins hands with Michael to contest in elections. Lallan later kills Gopal when he finds out that he had been instructed by Prosenjit to take him out due to Lallan leaving an eyewitness (Arjun) behind the bridge incident. He confronts Prosenjit, who brainwashes him to work for him and orders him to kidnap Arjun, Vishnu, and Trilok. However, they escape with the help of Lallan&#x27;s ally Dablu (Vijay Raaz), who has a change of heart after realizing that their profession was interfering with their personal lives, causing Sashi to leave Lallan for her hometown. He convinces Lallan, however, to no avail, and is killed by him when he aids Arjun&#x27;s escape.

While running, Arjun calls Michael for help, but Lallan easily catches and beats him up. Michael arrives at the nick of time to rescue Arjun at Vidyasagar Setu. A fight ensues between the three men where Lallan is overpowered by Michael, who spares him and leaves him for the police. Lallan is handed to the police. Michael, Arjun, Vishnu, and Trilok win the four seats they had contested for and thus enter politics.

== Production ==
Hrithik Roshan was initially supposed to play the role of Lallan Singh, but was replaced by Abhishek Bachchan, and Shah Rukh Khan was also initially supposed to play the role of Michael Mukherjee, but was replaced by Ajay Devgn. Bobby Deol and Akshay Kumar were also approached to play Michael. 

The film was shot at different locations including Kolkata, Chennai, Bhopal, Theni, Pollachi and other areas of West Bengal. During the shoot in Chennai, ambassador cars were painted yellow to make them look like Kolkata taxis.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack features six songs by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Mehboob. The rap and lyrics for the song &quot;Dol Dol&quot; were by Blaaze.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with Bachchan and Mukerji&#x27;s performances receiving particular praise. A critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has a sharp political edge that is rare in Hindi-language films, celebrated as they are for their wildly exuberant production numbers and sugary love stories&quot;. It was reported that the movie had the narrative style of the 2000 Mexican film &quot;Amores Perros&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Yuva&quot; grossed at Indian box office. &quot;Yuva&quot; did well in multiplexes. But it did not do well in single-screen theatres.
Compared to other parts of the country, it fared better in Mumbai. The Mumbai distributors recovered the cost of the film, but the sub-territory distributors in places like Surat and Baroda lost money. In places like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and even South India, distributors lost around 50 lakh (Rs 5 million) to 1 crore ( 10 million). In states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the viewers couldn&#x27;t relate to the film, hence leading to dismal business. Overseas, too, the film did below-average business.

== Accolades ==
The film received several accolades, including a leading 6 Filmfare Awards, one IIFA Award, one Producers Guild Film Awards, four Screen Awards and two Stardust Awards.

<text>The Frythe is a country house set in its own grounds in rural Hertfordshire, just south of the village of Welwyn, about 30 miles north of London.

==History==
===Early history===
The Frythe was part of the property of Holywell Priory, Shoreditch, and in 1523 William Wilshere obtained a sixty-year lease of the Frythe from the priory. As a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, in 1539 the property was granted to Sir John Gostwick and Joan his wife. Within ten years, Wilshere had purchased The Frythe from Gostwick&#x27;s heirs, and the property remained in the possession of the Wilshere family for several centuries.

The present &quot;Gothic revival&quot; mansion was built in 1846 for William Wilshere (MP for Great Yarmouth from 1837 to 1846). The architects were Thomas Smith and Edward Blore. After William Wilshere&#x27;s death in 1867 the house was enlarged by his brother Charles Willes Wilshere who inherited it. In 1908 on Charles Wilshere&#x27;s death, it passed on to his three unmarried daughters, until the last one died in 1934. The estate passed to a great-nephew, Captain Gerald Maunsell Gamul Farmer, of a landed gentry family of Nonsuch, Surrey, who adopted the surname of Wilshere, and ran the house as &quot;The Frythe Residential and Private Hotel&quot;.

===SOE Station IX===

&#x27;The Frythe&#x27; was commandeered in August 1939 by the British military intelligence. During the Second World War it became a secret British Special Operations Executive factory known as Station IX making commando equipment. Secret research included military vehicles and equipment, explosives and technical sabotage, camouflage, biological and chemical warfare. In the grounds of The Frythe small cabins and barracks functioned as laboratories and workshops.

===Research facility===
The Frythe was for many years a commercial research facility, operated by ICI from 1946, known as &#x27;Akers Research Laboratories&#x27; from around 1955, named after Sir Wallace Akers, who had died in 1954. From 1963 it was owned by Unilever, and by Smith, Kline &amp; French from 1977.

====Unilever====
From 1946 to 1963 the site was shared by ICI with Unilever. New buildings were built by Unilever in the 1960s, with a contract for £400,000 in 1964 to Taylor Woodrow. Research was conducted on edible oils, margarine, ice cream, and frozen foods in the 1960s. Techniques included molecular biophysics, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry, ESR spectroscopy (electron paramagnetic resonance), and infrared spectroscopy.

====GSK====

Smith, Kline &amp; French discovered Tagamet (Cimetidine) at The Frythe in 1971, which treats peptic ulcers by Sir James Black FRS and C. Robin Ganellin FRS with research on H2 antagonist.

===Residential Accommodation===
The Frythe site was closed by GlaxoSmithKline and sold to a property development company on 19 December 2010. In 2017, the conversion of the property into flats was still underway.

<doc id="1111249" wikidata="Q1641068" url="?curid=1111249" title="Hyperpigmentation">
<text>Hyperpigmentation, also known as the dark spots on the skin, is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin.

==Causes==

Hyperpigmentation can be caused by sun damage, inflammation, or other skin injuries, including those related to acne vulgaris. People with darker skin tones are more prone to hyperpigmentation, especially with excess sun exposure.

Many forms of hyperpigmentation are caused by an excess production of melanin. Hyperpigmentation can be diffuse or focal, affecting such areas as the face and the back of the hands. Melanin is produced by melanocytes at the lower layer of the epidermis. Melanin is a class of pigment responsible for producing color in the body in places such as the eyes, skin, and hair. The process of melanin synthesis (melanogenesis) starts with the oxidation of -tyrosine to  by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, then to -dopaquinone and dopachrome, which forms melanin.

As the body ages, melanocyte distribution becomes less diffuse and its regulation less controlled by the body. UV light stimulates melanocyte activity, and where concentration of the cells is greater, hyperpigmentation occurs. Another form of hyperpigmentation is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. These are dark and discoloured spots that appear on the skin following acne that has healed.

===Diseases and conditions===
Hyperpigmentation is associated with a number of diseases or conditions, including the following:

*Addison&#x27;s disease and other sources of adrenal insufficiency, in which hormones that stimulate melanin synthesis, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), are frequently elevated.
*Cushing&#x27;s disease or other excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, because MSH production is a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from proopiomelanocortin (POMC).
*Acanthosis nigricans—hyperpigmentation of intertriginous areas associated with insulin resistance.
*Melasma, also known as &#x27;chloasma&#x27; or the “mask of pregnancy,” when it occurs in pregnant women.— It is a common skin problem that causes dark discolored patchy hyperpigmentation. It typically occurs on the face and is symmetrical, with matching marks on both sides of the face. The condition is much more common in women than men, though men can get it too. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 90 percent of people who develop melasma are women.
*Post-Acne marks from post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
*Linea nigra—a hyperpigmented line found on the abdomen during pregnancy.
*Peutz–Jeghers syndrome—an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa and gastrointestinal polyps.
*Exposure to certain chemicals such as salicylic acid, bleomycin, and cisplatin.
*Smoker&#x27;s melanosis
*Coeliac disease
*Cronkhite–Canada syndrome
*Porphyria
*Tinea fungal infections such as ringworm.
*Haemochromatosis—a common but debilitating genetic disorder characterized by the chronic accumulation of iron in the body.
*Mercury poisoning—particularly cases of cutaneous exposure resulting from the topical application of mercurial ointments or skin-whitening creams.
*Aromatase deficiency
*Nelson&#x27;s syndrome
*Graves&#x27; disease
*Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SOID).
*As a result of tinea cruris.
* Due to B12 deficiency.
* Atopic dermatitis as a result of inflammation.

Hyperpigmentation can sometimes be induced by dermatological laser procedures.

==Diagnosis==

* Skin examination including Wood&#x27;s lamp examination.
* Viewing medical history.

==Treatment==
There are a wide range of depigmenting treatments used for hyperpigmentation conditions, and responses to most are variable.

Most often treatment of hyperpigmentation caused by melanin overproduction (such as melasma, acne scarring, liver spots) includes the use of topical depigmenting agents, which vary in their efficacy and safety, as well as in prescription rules.

===Topical treatments===
Many topical treatments disrupt the synthesis of melanin by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.

Several are prescription only in the US, especially in high doses, such as hydroquinone, azelaic acid, and kojic acid. Some are available without prescription, such as niacinamide, -ascorbic acid, retinoids such as tretinoin, or cysteamine hydrochloride. Hydroquinone was the most commonly prescribed hyperpigmentation treatment before the long-term safety concerns were raised, and the use of it became more regulated in several countries and discouraged in general by WHO. For the US, only 2% is at present sold over-the-counter, and 4% needs prescription. In the EU hydroquinone was banned from cosmetic applications.

===Oral===
Oral medication with procyanidin plus vitamins A, C, and E also shows promise as safe and effective for epidermal melasma. In an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 56 Filipino women, treatment was associated with significant improvements in the left and right malar regions, and was safe and well tolerated. Other treatments that do not involve topical agents are also available, including fraction lasers and dermabrasion.

===Laser treatments===
Laser toning using YAG lasers and intense pulsed light have been used to treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

<text>The Grey River / Māwheranui is located in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It rises 12 kilometres southwest of the Lewis Pass in Lake Christabel, one of numerous small lakes on the western side of the Southern Alps, and runs westward for 120 kilometres before draining into the Tasman Sea at Greymouth. Thomas Brunner, who explored the area in the late 1840s, named the river in honour of Sir George Grey, who first served as Governor of New Zealand from 1845 to 1854. The Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 changed the official name of the river to Grey River / Māwheranui in 1998. The Māori name for the river system and surrounding area is Māwhera, with &quot;Māwheranui&quot; being distinguished from the northern branch Little Grey River / Māwheraiti.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;broad and widespread (river mouth)&quot; for &quot;Māwheranui&quot;.

Numerous small rivers are tributaries of the Grey, and several of them also drain lakes. Notable among these are the Ahaura River and the Arnold River, the latter of which is the outflow of Lake Brunner, the largest lake of the northwest South Island. A small hydroelectric station stands on the river 25 kilometres upstream from the mouth.

The Grey River&#x27;s mouth is protected by a large sandbar, Greymouth bar, which is a notorious danger to shipping.

Raw sewage discharges into the Grey River after heavy rainfall. Historically, sewage and stormwater from Greymouth, Cobden and Blaketown were discharged without treatment directly into the Grey River. Changes to the Grey District Council&#x27;s wastewater schemes provide separation and treatment for sewage, except during periods of high rainfall, such as spring, when the capacity of the sewage treatment is exceeded.

<text>Live from Albertane is a live album by American pop rock group Hanson. As the name suggests, it is a live album, recorded during the group&#x27;s Albertane Tour. Albertane is a fictional place (the capital city of the planet Mars) referred to in their song &quot;Man from Milwaukee&quot;.

With the lead vocalist Taylor Hanson at age 15 at the time this album was recorded, his voice is noticeably deeper than in their previous releases. The song selection mostly focuses on the &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; album, but also contains some older material, a new track (&quot;Ever Lonely&quot;) and a couple of covers of classic songs.

It peaked at #32 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1998.

<doc id="1111265" wikidata="Q265422" url="?curid=1111265" title="Jean Acker">
<text>Jean Acker (born Harriet Ackers; October 23, 1892 – August 16, 1978) was an American actress with a career dating from the silent film era through the 1950s. She was perhaps best known as the estranged wife of silent film star Rudolph Valentino.

==Early life and career==
Jean Acker was born Harriet Ackers on October 23, 1892 in Trenton, New Jersey to Joseph and Margaret Ackers. The 1900 census indicates an 1891 birthdate, and other sources have suggested an 1893 birthdate. However, her burial plot says 1892. Her parents divorced, and her father remarried to Eleanor Bruseren in 1906. They had two sons together, both named Joseph. Their first son died at 4 months old in 1907, and their second son was a stillbirth. Eleanor and Joseph divorced in 1912, and he married a third time to Virginia Erb. Her father managed the Casino Bowling Alley and The Ritz Restaurant, and later owned the Boston Shoe Store on Valley Street. He also managed several bowling alleys in the Philadelphia area. In 1906, the family moved to Lewistown. Growing up on a farm, Ackers became an expert horsewoman. She attended St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey for a time. 

She performed in vaudeville until she moved to California in 1919. After arriving in Hollywood, Acker became the protegee and lover of Alla Nazimova, an actress whose clout and contacts enabled Acker to negotiate a $200 per week contract with a movie studio. Acker appeared in numerous films during the 1910s and 1920s, but by the early 1930s, she began appearing in small, mostly uncredited film roles. She made her last on-screen appearance in the 1955 film &quot;How to Be Very, Very Popular&quot;, opposite Betty Grable.

==Marriage to Valentino==
After meeting and befriending the then-struggling actor Rudolph Valentino at a party, they entered a two-month courtship and married on November 6, 1919. Acker quickly had regrets and locked him out of their hotel bedroom on their wedding night. The marriage was reportedly never consummated.

After filing for divorce, Valentino did not wait the requisite period for it to be finalized before marrying his second wife, Natacha Rambova, in Mexico, and he was charged with bigamy when the couple returned to the United States. Acker then sued Valentino for the legal right to call herself Mrs. Rudolph Valentino. Valentino remained angry with her for several years, but they mended their friendship before his death in 1926. Acker wrote a popular song about him soon after he died called &quot;We Will Meet at the End of the Trail&quot;.

Acker had an affair with the actress Alla Nazimova. Nazimova included Acker in what was dubbed the sewing circles, a group of actresses who were forced to conceal the fact that they were lesbian or bisexual, thus living secret lives. Another of her female lovers was Grace Darmond, with whom she was involved during her relationship with Valentino. 

In the 1977 film &quot;Valentino&quot; a character loosely based on Acker is played by Carol Kane. In the credits, the character is simply called Starlet.

==Later life and death==
After divorcing Valentino in 1923, Acker was engaged to Marquis Luis de Bezan y Sandoval of Spain. Then, she was in the news over her relationship with Rahmin Bey. In 1930, after she lost her fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, she sued William Delahanty, claiming that he agreed to pay her $18,400 per year if she gave up her film career. The married politician denied that he made such a promise but admitted that he spent thousands of dollars on Acker. Acker met Chloe Carter (June 21, 1903 – October 28, 1993), a former Ziegfeld Follies girl, who was the first wife of film composer Harry Ruby. Acker remained with Carter for the rest of her life. The couple owned an apartment building together in Beverly Hills. Acker died of natural causes in 1978 at the age of 85, and is buried next to Carter at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Legacy==
Although not born in the Central Pennsylvania town of Lewistown, Jean Acker is considered a local celebrity. Her face dominates an outdoor mural titled &quot;Mifflin County Movie History&quot; and is located on Monument Square in Downtown Lewistown. The mural was painted in 2012 by Dwight Kirkland of Blackleaf Studio, Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.

<text>Lake Brunner ( or ) is the largest lake in the West Coast Region of New Zealand, located southeast of Greymouth. The main settlement, Moana, is on its northern shore. It is an important settlement and waystation for local Māori. The first Europeans in the area were loggers, and sawmills were an important early industry. Being several kilometres inland from the coast road (), it is less frequently visited by tourists than many of the West Coast&#x27;s scenic highlights, but it is becoming increasingly popular, in part due to its reputation for fishing.

== Geography ==
Lake Brunner is the largest lake in the West Coast region, across with an area of 4061 ha, just over . The outlet of the lake is the Arnold River, a tributary of the Grey River / Māwheranui, next to the largest settlement of Moana, on the north shore of the lake. The largest rivers feeding into Lake Brunner are the Crooked River from the east, the Orangipuku River and Bruce Creek from the south at Swan Bay, and the Eastern Hohonu River from the west at Hohonu Spit. It is 31 km southwest of Greymouth, at an altitude of 76 m. Two small islands in Pah Bay near the mouth of the Crooked River are known as the Refuge Islands (Takataka and Takatakaiti).

The lake is normally reached by heading south from State Highway 7 at Stillwater, or north from Jacksons on State Highway 73. A smaller road connects Kumara and Inchbonnie via the lake&#x27;s southern shore. Most of the lake shore is only accessible by boat; the only settlements are Moana, Ruru, Te Kinga, and Mitchells. Bain Bay can be reached by a walking track from Mitchells, but a damaged bridge was removed in January 2021 and the track is currently closed.

Lake Brunner was created in the last ice age by a spur of the Taramakau Glacier, which split from the main glacier and flowed north either side of Mount Te Kinga, between it and the Hohonu Range. Both these prominent mountains are made of erosion-resistant granite and granodiorite, cooled magma 100–145 million years old. When the glacier receded about 11,000 years ago, it left behind moraines which impeded the flow of rivers to the sea and filled the gouged-out glacial valley; the large blocks of rock it dropped, known as glacial erratics, can still be found in the surrounding bush. At this point, the lake would have been larger and deeper than today, with several outflows, but the Arnold River eventually became the main one, cutting through the moraine ridges to drain the lake to its present level. The same process of moraine deposition and glacial retreat created nearby Kangaroo Lake, Lady Lake, and Lake Haupiri.

To the south of the lake, linking it to the Taramakau River valley, is a stretch of flat land known in the 1860s as the &quot;Natural Paddock&quot; or &quot;Bruce&#x27;s Paddock&quot;. The term &quot;paddock&quot; referred on the Coast to any treeless expanse, and Natural Paddock was mostly pakihi swamp.

The lake is large enough that it can be subject to severe weather, including a powerful easterly wind known as the &quot;Brucer&quot;, which blows up the valley from Inchbonnie, once belonging to Thomas Bruce (1831–1908) who began farming there in 1872.

Lake Brunner has a maximum depth of 109 m, but local stories claimed that the lake was bottomless, or that it was connected with the sea and rose and fell with the tides. A naval survey after WWII established its deepest part, near the Takataka islands by the mouth of the Crooked River, at around 335 feet. Like Lake Kaniere, the other large glacial lake on the West Coast, Lake Brunner is in a deeply-scoured basin and drops off quite rapidly around most of its shoreline. Its water is stained the colour of tea, sometimes appearing almost black, by the tannins—organic and humic acids—leached into its tributaries: a consequence of high rainfall in a catchment that is almost entirely forested. The lake waters are acidic, with a low pH and low oxygen levels compared to lakes on the eastern side of the main divide. The soils in its catchment are derived from greywacke, granite, and schist, and are low in nutrients, but unlike many other West Coast glacial lake, Lake Brunner has significant alluvial soils on its margin. The lake has less thermal stratification than other West Coast lakes, as it is subject to strong winds, and its level fluctuates significantly following heavy rain, sometimes covering the jetty at Moana.

== Name ==

Although the Māori name for the lake is often given as just &quot;Moana&quot;, two names for the lake are recorded. The first, &quot;Kōtuku moana&quot;, translates as &quot;sea of herons&quot;, referencing the white heron (&quot;Ardea alba modesta)&quot;, known to Māori as kōtuku. In New Zealand kōtuku have a population of roughly 200 at any one time, breeding only at Ōkārito on the West Coast, and are symbols of beauty and rarity in Māori culture.

The second name, &quot;Kōtukuwhakaoka&quot;, is shared with the Arnold River, and is the name of a Māori chief (&quot;Rangatira&quot;) from the North Island who came upon the lake after following the river upstream. According to Māori mythology, the chief was attacked and killed by a taniwha which lived in the lake, which later became one of the two islands in the lake after it was killed by the chief&#x27;s son. The name was variously rendered as &quot;Kotukuwakaho&quot; and &quot;Kotuku-kaoka&quot;; Brunner spelled it &quot;Kotu-urakaoka&quot; in the proclamation that in 1853 defined the boundaries of the province.

In the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the lake&#x27;s name was rendered slightly differently, as &quot;Kōtuku-Whakaoho&quot;. The origin was traced to a husband and wife, Kōtuka and Māwhera, who gave their names to the lake and the Grey River respectively.

The English name &quot;Lake Brunner&quot; was chosen by John Rochfort to honour the 19th century explorer Thomas Brunner, who was the first European to visit the lake.

== History ==

=== Māori occupation ===
The lake was a significant resting point for Māori groups travelling east or west over the Hurunui saddle. They would stop at the lake to fish for eels and kākahi (freshwater mussels), catch birds, or process pounamu. The green stone only found on the West Coast was a precious commodity to Māori all through Aotearoa, and a significant trade good for the Poutini Ngāi Tahu, the hapū who lived west of the Southern Alps / Tiritiri-o-te-moana. Fortified settlements were built at Pah Point on the eastern side of the lake, and on nearby Takataka Island, with terraces, stockades, and gardens. There is evidence of pounamu working taking place at Pah Point and Takakataka Island at the lake, and Kotuku up the Arnold Valley.

=== Early exploration ===

Brunner, who in the 1840s had undertaken several journeys to and from the West Coast alone or in the company of Charles Heaphy—but always led, provisioned, and hosted by local Māori—spent Christmas of 1847 at the settlement of Māwhera at the mouth of the Māwheranui (Grey River). The resident Poutini Ngāi Tahu told him about a lake upriver, and Brunner was keen to explore the area inland. After a three-week delay while his guides went on a fishing trip, and ten days of provisioning, Brunner and twenty Māori set off upriver in four canoes on 26 January 1848. Heading up what came to be known as the Arnold River, the party reached the lake on 29 January. They camped on Takataka (later known as the Refuge Islands) near the mouth of the Crooked River, where they ate kākahi and raupō root, and Brunner smoked the last of his tobacco. His guides told Brunner there was an overland route across the mountains near the Taramakau River, but the group turned back and headed to the Grey and the Inangahua Valley.

In October 1857 Leonard Harper, led by Ihaia Tainui and three other Māori, left Canterbury and crossed the mountains at the Hurunui Saddle, known afterwards as the Harper Pass. Heading down the Taramakau towards the sea, he glimpsed grassy flats and the lake on his right, but did not investigate. In February 1859 surveyor John Rochfort followed the same route down the Taramakau, but after camping below its junction with the Ōtira, east of Mount Turiwhate, he headed north through the low gap that led to the lake. On the shore the party made a canoe from a kahikatea log and crossed the lake, which Rochfort named after Thomas Brunner, and exited by the river he dubbed the &quot;Arnould&quot;.

From January to March 1863 young explorer Herbert Charlton Howitt, who previously explored for gold across the Hurunui Saddle, cut a trail over the pass to Lake Brunner. He initially planned to make a trail around the lake shore to the Arnold River as a route to the coast. In April he decided instead to cut a track from the lakeshore over the Hohunu Range to the lower Taramakau, avoiding the dangerous Taramakau Gorge. On 27 June, Howitt and two of his party set off across the lake by canoe to fish for eels and retrieve stores from their camp at the Arnold River outlet, and were never seen again. The canoe, which sat only three inches above the water when laden, was presumably swamped in a storm, and the three men drowned; numerous subsequent searches turned up only his tent and some eel lines at the lake shore.

In December 1865, during the West Coast gold rush, word got around that a group of prospectors, known as the &quot;Kangaroo party&quot;, had lodged a claim on land to the north-east of Lake Brunner. Eight hundred men headed to the lake, where they found a ferry boat waiting to take them across the lake at 15 shillings a head, and a well-stocked store on the other side. When no gold was to be found, an angry mob looted and demolished the store and headed back to Greymouth. Flooding in the swamp at the Arnold River outlet marooned 200 of them, who clung to kahikatea trunks without food until the waters receded.

=== Railway construction ===

By 1867 the Canterbury provincial government had built a bush track along the south bank of the Grey and Arnold rivers, and along the south-west shore of the lake to Natural Paddock. The first farmers in the area settled around the Crooked River in 1868–69. In the 1880s a railway linking Greymouth and Christchurch was begun, which opened up the Arnold Valley and Lake Brunner. The route was originally proposed to follow the eastern side of the lake, but Westland MP Richard Seddon, from 1891 Minister of Public Works, insisted that it follow the western shore, closer to his constituency of Kumara. After some wrangling, the railway was laid to the east of the lake, and a road constructed to connect Kumara with the southern lakeshore, from which a steamboat could convey people to a railway station—although this ferry never eventuated. Moana had its own railway station by 1892, and the line continued as far south as Te Kinga, where it hit swampland. Materials were then conveyed by the steam launch &quot;Little Tay&quot; across the lake and up the Orangipuku River to Inchbonnie, and during 1893 construction continued in both directions up to Rotomanu and down to Jacksons. The link between Stillwater and Ōtira was completed in 1894. The Midland Line connecting Greymouth and Christchurch opened in 1923, after 36 years of construction and the building of the Ōtira Tunnel. The building of the railway created a market for the long-lasting timber of manoao or silver pine (&quot;Manoao colensoi&quot;), which was used for railway sleepers, telegraph poles, and bridges.

All trains stopped at Moana for water, and the settlement quickly grew: by 1906 it had four shops and a billiard room, and in 1907 a grand hall opened, hosting bachelor dances for the timber workers. The road took longer: by 1896 it had reached from the south from Rotomanu to Bell Hill, with a track to Stillwater, and by 1918 it was possible to drive from Rotumanu to Kotuku and then Greymouth—although the road was only kept navigable by grazing deer and a gate needed to be traversed at Bell Hill.

=== Sawmilling ===

Numerous sawmills sprung up along the railway line; some transported felled trees to the railway with bush trams operating on wooden rails. Other had logging gangs felling trees around the lake and towing them by boat to mills on the lake shore. Nyberg&#x27;s mill, later the Lake Brunner Sawmilling Company, operated in Ruru. The Moana Sawmill Company, with a log landing near the Arnold River outfall. Stratford and Blair operated a sawmill beside the Moana railway station. In the 1930s trees were felled at Irishman&#x27;s Landing across the lake and towed by launch, the &quot;Monica,&quot; to Moana. United Mills operated in Te Kinga, using timber felled in a logging camp across the lake at Bain Bay. Initially they were transported across the lake by the &quot;Tiki&quot;, a steam launch, and from 1938 to 1963 by the &quot;Tikinui&quot;, which towed a punt onto which logs that would not float were fastened. When a &quot;Brucer&quot; blew, waves were so high they would break over the Tikinui&#x27;s wheelhouse (8 feet above lake level); the boat would cast loose its punt and logs and make for shelter, returning to retrieve any floating logs the next day. After native timber forestry had ceased on the West Coast, a business sprang up using divers and chains to salvage logs from the lake bottom for milling. Logs that had sunk to the lake floor a century ago remained perfectly preserved, with axe marks still visible.

In the Great Depression, two thirds of the area&#x27;s sawmills shut down, and in 1963 the Lake Brunner Sawmilling Company, the first to send logs through the Ōtira Tunnel, closed from lack of suitable timber. The cleared flat land around the lake proved suitable for farming, particularly dairy herds, and from the early 1960s local farms were supplying the Westland Cooperative Dairy Co. in Hokitika. By 1976 twenty percent of the catchment of the lake was farmed and Moana had a population of 84, with most of the buildings being holiday homes.

== Flora ==

Lake Brunner is notable in being surrounded by intact native forest, although the flats have been extensively logged while kahikatea (&quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;) swamp forest is found at many points along the lake shore. Kahikatea is able to tolerate submergence of its roots, and when lake levels are high it is possible to travel by kayak through forests of 30 m trees, one of the few places on the West Coast where this is easily done. The lakeside kahikatea and flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) community includes small-leaved divaricating shrubs like mingimingi and &quot;Coprosma rhamnoides&quot;, and the trees rimu and kamahi.

Much of the forest on the flats and surrounding hills is tall podocarp forest, predominantly kahihatea, rimu (&quot;Dacrydium cupressinum&quot;), tōtara (&quot;Podocarpus totara&quot;), and silver pine/manoao (&quot;Manoao colensoi&quot;), which can reach the lake edge at places like the Hohonu River. The drier forest away from the lake edge is dominated by rimu, mataī (&quot;Prumnopitys taxifolia&quot;), Hall&#x27;s tōtara &quot;(Podocarpus laetus&quot;), and needle-leafed tōtara (&quot;P. acutifolius&quot;). On the higher slopes the forest is predominantly southern beech (formerly &quot;Nothofagus&quot;). In the understory can be found wheki-ponga (&quot;Dicksonia fibrosa&quot;), distinguished by its skirt of dead fronds, marble-leaf (&quot;Carpodetus serratus&quot;), and the climbing rātā &quot;Metrosideros perforata&quot;. On the forest floor ferns include crown fern (&quot;Lomaria discolor&quot;), hanging spleenwort (&quot;Asplenium flaccidum&quot;) growing as an epiphyte on tree trunks, Prince of Wales feathers fern (&quot;Leptopteris superba&quot;), and filmy ferns (&quot;Hymenophyllum&quot;). These are most easily observed from the Rakaitane Walk.

Māori occupied both Takataka (Refuge Island) and Takatakaiti until about 1850, clearing all the forest and leaving only bracken fern (&quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot;). Because the islands have no deer or possums, vegetation was able to regenerate undisturbed. Takataka was declared a Scenic Reserve in 1944. A vegetation survey in 1978 found young podocarp forest on the southern part of Takataka and scrub elsewhere; this has since become low forest, with only a small patch of bracken remaining.

The phytoplankton of Lake Brunner is composed mostly of diatoms, Chlorophyceae, and Chrysophyceae. It contains species of &quot;Staurastrum&quot;, &quot;Volvox&quot;, and &quot;Asterionella&quot; (specifically &quot;Asterionella formosa&quot;) that are common in lakes on the East Coast, but rare in the West.

== Fauna ==

Both the white-faced heron (&quot;Egretta novaehollandiae&quot;) and the white heron / kōtuku (&quot;Ardea modesta&quot;) occur at Lake Brunner, and waterfowl include black swans (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;), Canada geese (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;), scaup (&quot;Aythya novaeseelandiae&quot;), paradise shelducks (&quot;Tadorna variegata&quot;), grey ducks (&quot;Anas superciliosa&quot;), mallards (&quot;A. platyrhynchos&quot;), and coots (&quot;Fulica atra&quot;). Little shags (&quot;Phalacrocorax melanoleucos&quot;) and black shags (&quot;P. carbo&quot;) can both be found. Birdlife is most common and easily observed in Iveagh Bay. Fernbirds can often be seen in the mixed kahikatea/flax vegetation on the track to Bain Bay.

The New Zealand freshwater mussel (&quot;Hyridella menziesi&quot;) is found in Lake Brunner. It is the only South Island lake with the calanoid copepod &quot;Boeckella delicata&quot;.

=== Fishing ===

Fishing for eels at the lake was popular amongst both Māori and European settlers. Today, though, Lake Brunner is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most significant brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) fisheries, and is often referred to as &quot;the place where fish die of old age&quot;. There are also small numbers of rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss).&quot; Rainbow trout originate in North America, and brown trout are a European game fish introduced throughout New Zealand following the establishment of a hatchery in Tasmania in the 1860s. In 1891, 15,000 young trout were transported from Greymouth by rail to stock the lake. Smelt (&quot;Retropinna retropinna&quot;) were also liberated in Lake Brunner to serve as food for trout, but did not establish.

Trout are caught from boats in the shallow lake waters, especially Iveagh Bay, or by fly fishing in the Orangaipuku, Hohonum or Crooked Rivers and the mouth of the Arnold River. The fish are abundant but not large—only 1 to 1.5 kg. The temperate West Coast climate means trout can still be caught in winter, when in the cooler eastern South Island lakes they are much less active.

== Recreation ==
The lake was early on recognised for its natural beauty, and in 1887 a tourist account celebrated the impending railway, and the lake &quot;soon will be dotted with handsome villas, the summer residence of the aristocracy of Greymouth and the surrounding districts.&quot; Sailing was a popular early activity, and in 1892 the first regatta attracted a trainload of 350 sightseers. The growth of tourism led to the opening in 1931 of the 22-room Grand Chateau Moana, which went bankrupt the following year. A motor camp was built in 1959 in Moana, and a jetty, slipway, and car park in 1961. In the 1960s building a holiday home or &quot;bach&quot; at Moana or Iveagh Bay became popular with Christchurch or Greymouth families. There are boat launching ramps at Moana, Te Kinga (with lake access at Cashmere Bay), and Mitchells. Iveagh Bay was once a backwater, but has rapidly-increasing numbers of expensive holiday mansions.

Swimming, kayaking, waterskiing, and jetskis are all popular at Lake Brunner. Because the lake is fed from surrounding forest, not snow, it can reach pleasant temperatures in summer. The lake is surrounded by bush walks: Carew Falls and Bain Bay (currently closed) from Mitchells, the Mount Te Kinga / Aora o Te Kinga Track from Iveagh Bay, and the short Valenski Walk and Rakaitane Track from Moana.

==Water quality==

Lake Brunner is recognised for its ecological value and importance to the tangata whenua, to tourism and to fisheries. The lake is classified as oligotrophic, meaning that it has naturally low levels of nutrients, low levels of algae and the water is of high quality. Regular monitoring of water quality in Lake Brunner began in the early 1990s. A report in 2006 identified declining water quality, and this was followed in 2010 by an update describing increasing nutrient levels in surface water, increasing chlorophyll (an indicator of biomass of algae), and a decrease in water clarity. The report suggested that intensification of agriculture in the catchment area could be the cause of the deterioration.

There are 25 dairy farms in the catchment area of Lake Brunner. Dairy farmers responded to the concerns about deteriorating water quality by investing in riparian planting, improved fencing of waterways and bridging of streams on their properties. Many also invested in improved effluent treatment systems. A community group, the Lake Brunner Community Catchment Care Group, was formed to support environmental initiatives include riparian planting around waterways on farms and on public land. The group comprised around 60 individuals, and had support from regional and local councils, NZ Landcare Trust, Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Waewae, Fish &amp; Game, the Brunner Residents Association, and representatives of the dairy industry, including Westland Milk Products. In 2016, at the Local Government Excellence Awards, the West Coast Regional Council received a &quot;highly commended&quot; award for its entry: &quot;Lake Brunner Water Quality Enhancement Project.&quot; By 2021, it was reported that of fencing had been constructed on farms in the catchment along with 21,000 plants in riparian strips.

Water quality updates are published periodically by the West Coast Regional Council. The December 2021 update reports that the lake is safe for swimming and recreation, and has remained in an oligotrophic (low nutrient) state. The levels of phosphorus are graded A on the National Objectives Framework issued under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, and are sufficiently low that growth of algae is inhibited. Levels of total nitrogen and lakebed dissolved oxygen are graded B on the same scale.

<doc id="1111267" wikidata="Q1229945" url="?curid=1111267" title="Pleurodesis">
<text>Pleurodesis is a medical procedure in which part of the pleural space is artificially obliterated. It involves the adhesion of the visceral and the costal pleura. The mediastinal pleura is spared.

== Uses ==
Pleurodesis is performed to prevent recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and can be done chemically or mechanically. It is generally avoided in patients with cystic fibrosis if possible, because lung transplantation becomes more difficult following this procedure. Previous pneumothorax with or without pleurodesis is not a contraindication to subsequent lung transplantation.

=== Chemical ===
Chemicals such as bleomycin, tetracycline (e.g., minocycline), povidone-iodine, or a slurry of talc can be introduced into the pleural space through a chest drain. The instilled chemicals cause irritation between the parietal and the visceral layers of the pleura which closes off the space between them and prevents further fluid from accumulating. Pharmacy-prepared chemicals for pleurodesis should be clearly labeled &quot;NOT FOR IV ADMINISTRATION&quot; to avoid potentially fatal wrong-site medication errors.

Sterile talc powder, administered intrapleurally via a chest tube, is indicated as a sclerosing agent to decrease the recurrence of malignant pleural effusions in symptomatic patients. It is usually performed at the time of a diagnostic thoracoscopy.

Povidone iodine is equally effective and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost.

Chemical pleurodesis is a painful procedure, and so patients are often premedicated with a sedative and analgesics. A local anesthetic may be instilled into the pleural space, or an epidural catheter may be placed for anesthesia.

=== Surgical ===
Surgical pleurodesis, also known as mechanical or abrasive pleurodesis, may be performed via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. This involves mechanically irritating the apical and the costal pleura, often with a scratchpad (a small foam pad with coated abrasive) normally used for cleaning electrocautery blade tips. Moreover, surgical removal of parietal pleura is an effective way of achieving stable pleurodesis.

Alternatively, tunneled pleural catheters (TPCs) may be placed in an outpatient setting and often result in auto-pleurodesis, whereby portable vacuum bottles are used to evacuate the pleural fluid. Routine evacuation keeps the pleura together, resulting in physical agitation by the catheter, which slowly causes the pleura to scar together. This method, though the minimally invasive and minimal cost solution, takes an average of about 30 days to achieve pleurodesis and is therefore the slowest means of achieving pleurodesis among other modalities.

Conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.

<text>.ki is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Kiribati.

From the early 1990s to the early 2000s the domain was managed on behalf of the Republic of Kiribati by Connect.com.au, an Australian ISP, with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, based in Honiara, Solomon Islands as original sponsor, then transferred to the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources Development of Kiribati and finally to the Ministry of Communications, Transport, and Tourism Development. In 2002 direct management of the ccTLD was transferred to Telecom Services Kiribati Limited. This initial set up was done by Franck Martin. As of 2007, the registry is being handled by the Telecommunications Authority of Kiribati using a system of multiple registrars similar to that used by gTLDs; however, few sites are using .ki domains. Because of the location of Kiribati and limited Internet connection, it is not uncommon for a website in Kiribati, such as a government website, to be very slow or inaccessible; however, many .ki sites are hosted outside Kiribati.

.ki is a member of CoCCA, a group of country-code domains making use of common registry and/or dispute resolution services.

== Second-level domains ==

Domains can be registered directly under &quot;.ki&quot;, or at the third level beneath &quot;com.ki&quot;, &quot;biz.ki&quot;, &quot;net.ki&quot;, &quot;info.ki&quot;, &quot;org.ki&quot;, &quot;gov.ki&quot;, &quot;edu.ki&quot;, &quot;mob.ki&quot;, and &quot;tel.ki&quot;. The fee for a second-level domain is AUD1,000, whilst all others with the exception of edu.ki, which costs AUD50, are AUD150. edu.ki and gov.ki and reserved for their respective entities in Kiribati, such as The University of the South Pacific, Kiribati Centre.

<doc id="1111272" wikidata="Q1589604" url="?curid=1111272" title="Premedication">
<text>Premedication is using medication before some other therapy (usually surgery or chemotherapy) to prepare for that forthcoming therapy. Typical examples include premedicating with a sedative or analgesic before surgery; using prophylactic (preventive) antibiotics before surgery; and using antiemetics or antihistamines before chemotherapy.

Premedication before chemotherapy for cancer often consists of drug regimens (usually 2 or more drugs, e.g. dexamethasone, diphenhydramine and omeprazole) given to a patient minutes to hours before the chemotherapy to avert side effects or hypersensitivity reactions (i.e. allergic reactions).

Melatonin has been found to be effective as a premedication in both adults and children due to its pharmacological properties of hypnotic, antinociceptive and anticonvulsant which produce effective anxiolysis and sedation. Unlike midazolam, melatonin does not impair psychomotor skills or adversely affect the quality of recovery. It has a faster recovery time compared to midazolam and has a reduced incidence of post-operative excitement and results in a reduction in dose required of propofol and thiopental.

Midazolam is effective in children in reducing anxiety associated with separation from parents and induction of anesthesia. Sufentanil is also sometimes used as a premedication. Clonidine is becoming increasingly popular as a premedication for children. One drawback of clonidine is that it can take up to 45 minutes to take full effect. In children, clonidine has been found to be equal to and possibly superior to benzodiazepines as a premedication. It has a more favourable side effect profile. It also reduces the need for an induction agent. It improves post-operative pain relief, is better at inducing sedation at induction, reduces agitated emergence, reduces shivering and post-operative nausea and vomiting and reduces post-operative delirium associated with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam are more commonly used due largely to a lack of a marketing effort by the pharmaceutical companies. As a result, clonidine is becoming increasingly popular with anesthesiologists. Dexmedetomidine and atypical antipsychotic agents are other premedications which are used particularly in very uncooperative children.

Non-drug interventions for children include playing relaxing music, massages, reducing noise and controlling light to maintain the sleep wake cycle. Other non-pharmacological options for children who refuse or cannot tolerate premedication include clown doctors; low sensory stimulation and hand-held video games may also help reduce anxiety during induction of general anesthesia.

<text>The standing high jump is an athletics event that was featured in the Olympics from 1900 to 1912. It is performed in the same way as high jump, with the difference being that the athlete has no run-up and must stand still and jump with both feet together.

Ray Ewry was the best of the Olympic era, setting world records for the standing high jump (1.65 m on July 16, 1900). He was also highly successful in the standing long jump and the standing triple jump.

The event previously enjoyed wide competition, featuring on the Olympics athletics programme from 1900 to 1912, as well as at the 1922 and 1926 Women&#x27;s World Games. The event was contested at the Amateur Athletic Union championships in the United States as an indoor event around the turn of the 20th century. Its popularity waned in the 20th century, although it maintained championship status for a longer period of time in Scandinavian countries.

One of the best results ever is 1.90 m by Swedish athlete Rune Almén in 1980 which at the time was a Swedish record and an unofficial world record. Later he also jumped 1.90 m, which today is the world record. The Norwegian record is 1.82 by Sturle Kalstad in 1983.

<text>Standing triple jump is an athletics event based on the conventional triple jump with three jumping phases, but without an approach run-up. It is one of three standing variants of track and field jumping events, along with the standing high jump and standing long jump.

While it is no longer an official competitive event, it is still used as a training exercise.

The first phase is a hop from a stand still, which requires the athlete to take-off from a two-footed stand, split in mid air, and land on the preferred foot. The next phase is a long stretched step, landing on the opposite foot. The last phase is the jump, where the athlete lands on both feet. The winner is the competitor who achieves the longest distance on one of the 3 or 6 attempts.
Competitions in standing triple jump are not very common today, but the event was included in the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics.

<text>Adopted child syndrome is a term that has been used to explain behaviors in adopted children that are claimed to be related to their adoptive status. Specifically, these include problems in bonding, attachment disorders, lying, stealing, defiance of authority, and acts of violence. The term has never achieved acceptance in the professional community. The term is not found in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot;, 4th edition, TR.

== History of the term ==
David Kirschner, who coined the term, says that most adoptees are not disturbed and that the syndrome only applies to &quot;a small clinical subgroup.&quot;

Researchers Brodizinsky, Schechter, and Henig find that in a review of the literature, generally children adopted before the age of six months fare no differently than children raised with their biological parents. Later problems that develop among children adopted from the child welfare system at an older age are usually associated with the effects of chronic early maltreatment in the caregiving relationship; abuse and neglect.

Psychologist Betty Jean Lifton, herself an adopted person, has written extensively on psychopathology in adopted people, primarily in &quot;Lost and Found: The Adoption Experience&quot;, and &quot;Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness&quot; and briefly discusses Adopted child syndrome.

<text>Arbetarkommun alt. Arbetarekommun (Labour Commune) is the municipal unit of Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetareparti (Social Democratic Labour Party of Sweden). An arbetarkommun consists of several base level party units, workplace units, etc.

Historically the term had been used also by other socialist parties in Sweden. The Communist Party (SKP and later VPK), had a municipal units called Kommunistiska Arbetarkommuner (KAK, Communist Labour Communes). The break-away Arbetarpartiet Kommunisterna (Workers Party - Communists) and the revived SKP started by them has continued to call their local units KAKs.

<text>Ford 7Y is a car built by Ford UK from 1938 until 1939. During that time 65,098 cars were produced.

The car was officially marketed as a Ford Eight, and was a rebodied and slightly larger version of the Model Y. The car was powered by a 8 hp (RAC horsepower) Ford sidevalve engine.

A minor facelift, unveiled in September 1939, resulted in the first Anglia.

The car sported some unusual features such as openable rear windows that were located in the main body work as this was only a two-door vehicle. A rear wheel cover was available on the de-luxe models with the standard version also having a recess in the rear bodywork to accept the spare wheel, albeit not covered. The storage of the spare wheel in this manner mimics the styling of the V8 Pilot. The 7Y was also the last model to be fitted with a &#x27;kink&#x27; in the front bumper before the simpler straight bumpers were introduced on the Anglia (E04A). The &#x27;kink&#x27; and accompanying opening in the bottom of the grille allowed for starting the engine with a hand crank.

==Ford 8hp E94A Roadster==

For 1939 the Y7 tourer was replaced by the E94A Roadster. It retained the front styling, 8 hp engine and 90-inch wheelbase of the 7Y tourer but featured different rear panels. The E94A was produced only for the 1939 model year.

<doc id="1111296" wikidata="Q1969019" url="?curid=1111296" title="Chest tube">
<text>A chest tube (also chest drain, thoracic catheter, tube thoracostomy or intercostal drain) is a surgical drain that is inserted through the chest wall and into the pleural space or the mediastinum. The insertion of the tube is sometimes a lifesaving procedure. The tube can be used to remove clinically undesired substances such as air (pneumothorax), excess fluid (pleural effusion or hydrothorax), blood (hemothorax), chyle (chylothorax) or pus (empyema) from the intrathoracic space. An intrapleural chest tube is also known as a Bülau drain or an intercostal catheter (ICC), and can either be a thin, flexible silicone tube (known as a &quot;pigtail&quot; drain), or a larger, semi-rigid, fenestrated plastic tube, which often involves a flutter valve or underwater seal.

The concept of chest drainage was first advocated by Hippocrates when he described the treatment of empyema by means of incision, cautery and insertion of metal tubes. However, the technique was not widely used until the influenza epidemic of 1918 to evacuate post-pneumonic empyema, which was first documented by Dr. C. Pope, on a 22-month-old infant. The use of chest tubes in postoperative thoracic care was reported in 1922, and they were regularly used post-thoracotomy in World War II, though they were not routinely used for emergency tube thoracostomy following acute trauma until the Korean War.

==Uses==

Medical uses of chest tube are as follows:
* Pneumothorax: accumulation of air or gas in the pleural space
* Pleural effusion: accumulation of fluid in the pleural space
** Chylothorax: a collection of lymph in the pleural space
** Empyema: a pyogenic infection of the pleural space
** Hemothorax: accumulation of blood in the pleural space
** Hydrothorax: accumulation of serous fluid in the pleural space
** Urinothorax: accumulation of urine in the pleural space

==Contraindications==
Contraindications to chest tube placement include refractory coagulopathy and presence of a diaphragmatic hernia, as well as hepatic hydrothorax. Additional contraindications include scarring in the pleural space (adhesions).

==Complications==
Complications that are sometimes associated with chest tubes include the potential for clogging, air leaks, infection, hemorrhage, re-expansion pulmonary edema. Injury to the liver, spleen or diaphragm is also possible if the tube is placed behind (inferior) to the pleural cavity or is mispositioned. Injuries to the thoracic aorta and heart can also occur. The rate of complications of chest tubes inserted for trauma-related treatment needs has been estimated at approximately 19%. The rate of complications is variable and other estimations have been made that share a rate of closer to 40%.

=== Insertional complications ===
Complications that arise while the chest tube is being inserted or within the first day of the insertional procedure include a risk of injury to organs near the insertional site. 

=== Positional complications ===
Complications that arise after the tube has been inserted for one day or longer include the potential for tube blockages (obstruction), air leaks, kinking, or entrapment in the lung fissure once the lung has been expanded. Chest tube clogging can lead to retained blood around the heart and lungs that can contribute to complications and increase mortality. A common complication after thoracic surgery that arises within 30–50% of patients are air leaks. If a chest tube clogs when there is an air leak the patient will develop a pneumothorax. This can be life-threatening. Here, digital chest drainage systems can provide real time information as they monitor intra-pleural pressure and air leak flow, constantly. Keeping vigilant about chest tube clogging is imperative for the team taking care of the patient in the early postoperative period.

Minor complications include a subcutaneous hematoma or seroma, anxiety, shortness of breath, and cough (after removing large volume of fluid). In most cases, the chest tube related pain goes away after the chest tube is removed, however, chronic pain related to chest tube induced scarring of the intercostal space is not uncommon.

Subcutaneous emphysema indicates backpressure created by undrained air, often caused by a clogged chest tube or insufficient negative pressure. If a person has subcutaneous emphysema, it is likely their chest tube is not draining and consideration should be given if it should be unclogged or another tube should be placed so that the air leaking from the lung can be adequately drained.

=== Infections ===
Problems keeping the site clean or with sterilizing instruments can lead to infections. When chest tubes are placed due to either blunt or penetrating trauma, antibiotics may decrease the risks of infectious complications.

=== Removal complications ===
There is also a risk of complications after the chest tube has been removed. Potential complications include problems with re-sealing the chest that can lead to trapped air or if a foreign object is retained in the chest after the procedure.

==Device==

===Characteristics===
Chest tubes are commonly made from clear plastics like PVC and soft silicone. Chest tubes are made in a range of sizes measured by their external diameter from 6 Fr to 40 Fr. Chest tubes, like most catheters, are measured in French catheter scale. For adults, 20 Fr to 40 Fr (6.7 to 13.3mm external diameter) are commonly used, and 6 Fr to 26 Fr for children. Conventional chest tubes feature multiple drainage fenestrations in the section of the tube which resides inside the patient, as well as distance markers along the length of the tube, and a radiopaque stripe which outlines the first drainage hole. Chest tubes are also provided in right angle, trocar, flared, and tapered configurations for different drainage needs. As well, some chest tubes are coated with heparin to help prevent thrombus formation, though the effect of this is disputed.

Chest tube have an end hole (proximal, toward the patient) and a series of side holes. The number of side holes is generally 6 on most chest tubes. The length of tube that has side holes is the effective drainage length (EDL). In chest tubes designed for pediatric heart surgery, the EDL is shorter, generally by only having 4 side holes.

Channel style chest drains, also called Blake drains, are so-called silastic drains made of silicone and feature open flutes that reside inside the patient. Drainage is thought to be achieved by capillary action, allowing the fluids to travel through the open grooves into a closed cross section, which contains the fluid and allows it to be suctioned through the tube. Though these chest tubes are more expensive than conventional ones, they are theoretically less painful.

===Chest drainage system===
A chest drainage system is typically used to collect chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, drainage systems use three chambers which are based on the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a &quot;water seal&quot;, which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed &quot;dry&quot; systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called &quot;wet-dry&quot; systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called &quot;wet&quot; systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.

The free end of the tube is usually attached to an underwater seal, below the level of the chest. This allows the air or fluid to escape from the pleural space, and prevents anything returning to the chest. Alternatively, the tube can be attached to a flutter valve. This allows patients with pneumothorax to remain more mobile.

More recently digital or electronic chest drainage systems have been introduced. An onboard motor is used as vacuum source along with an integrated suction control canister and water seal. These systems monitor the patient and will alert if the measured data are out of range. Due to the digital control of the negative pressure, the system is able to objectively quantify the presence of a pleural or system leak. Digital drainage systems allow clinicians to mobilize patients early, even for those on continuous suction, which is difficult to accomplish with the traditional water-seal system under suction. Application of such systems can also lead to a reduction in complications.

==Technique==

===Thoracostomy===
It can be inserted in an area described as the &quot;safe zone&quot;, which is a region bordered by the lateral border of pectoralis major, a horizontal line inferior to the axilla, the anterior border of latissimus dorsi and a horizontal line superior to the nipple. This should translate to the tube being inserted into the fifth intercostal space slightly anterior to the mid axillary line.

Chest tubes are usually inserted under local anesthesia. The skin over the area of insertion is first cleansed with antiseptic solution, such as iodine, before sterile drapes are placed around the area. The local anesthetic is injected into the skin and down to the muscle, and after the area is numb a small incision is made in the skin and a passage made through the skin and muscle into the chest. The tube is placed through this passage. If necessary, patients may be given additional analgesics for the procedure. Once the tube is in place it is sutured to the skin to prevent it falling out and a dressing applied to the area. Once the drain is in place, a chest radiograph will be taken to check the location of the drain. The tube stays in for as long as there is air or fluid to be removed, or risk of air gathering.

Chest tubes can also be placed using a trocar, which is a pointed metallic bar used to guide the tube through the chest wall. This method is less popular due to an increased risk of iatrogenic lung injury. Placement using the Seldinger technique, in which a blunt guidewire is passed through a needle (over which the chest tube is then inserted) has been described.

Protocols to maintain chest tube patency by preventing chest tube clogging are necessary.

===Postoperative drainage===
The placement technique for postoperative drainage (e.g. cardiac surgery) differs from the technique used for emergency situations. At the completion of open cardiac procedures, chest tubes are placed through separate stab incisions, typically near the inferior aspect of the sternotomy incision. In some instances multiple drains may be used to evacuate the mediastinal, pericardial, and pleural spaces. The drainage holes are placed inside the patient and the chest tube is passed out through the incision. Once the tube is in place, it is sutured to the skin to prevent movement. The chest tube is then connected to the drainage canister using additional tubing and connectors and connected to a suction source, typically regulated to -20 cm of water.

===Dressings===
After suturing, dressings are applied for hygienical reasons covering the wound. First, a y-slit compress is used around the tube. Second, a compress (10 x 10 cm) is placed on top and finally an adhesive plaster is added in a way that tension is avoided. A bridle rein is recommended to fix the tube to the skin. This tape bridge will prevent the tube from moving backwards and the possibility to cause clogging. It also prevents pain as it reduces tension on the fixation stitch. Alternatively, a large adhesive plaster that functions like a tape bridge may be used.

===Management===

Chest tubes should be kept free of dependent loops, kinks, and obstructions which may prevent drainage. In general, chest tubes are not clamped except during insertion, removal, or when diagnosing air leaks.

Chest tube clogging with blood clots of fibrinous material is common. When this occurs, it can result in retained blood around the heart or lungs that can lead to complications such as hematoma that needs to be drained, effusions, empyema, or, in the long term, fibrothorax. Thus its critical to maintain chest tube patency. Manual manipulation, often called milking, stripping, fan folding, or tapping, of chest tubes is commonly performed to clear chest tube obstructions. However these approaches are controversial. No conclusive evidence has demonstrated that any of these techniques are more effective than the others, and no method has shown to improve chest tube drainage. Furthermore, chest tube manipulation has proved to increase negative pressure, which may be detrimental, and painful to the patient. For these reasons, many hospitals do not allow these types of manual tube manipulations.

One option is active chest tube clearance without breaking the sterile field. According to a consensus of multiple experts in cardiac surgery, anesthesia and critical care in 2019 the ERAS Guidelines for Perioperative Care recommends active clearance of chest tubes to prevent retained blood and other complications. Makeshift efforts such as open chest tube clearing that involves breaking the sterile environment separating the chest tube from the drainage canister tubing to suction it out should not be performed.

The chest tube can only be removed when the subject clinical condition is stable, the lungs are fully aerated as seen on chest X-ray, chest tube drainage is less than 200 cc per day, and there is no air leak into the lungs pleura.

===Site of placement===
In December 2018 the &quot;European Respiratory Journal&quot; published correspondences that raise the possibility of improving mobility as well as patient outcomes by placing a chest tube more optimally.

<doc id="1111313" wikidata="Q2307034" url="?curid=1111313" title="Pressed wood">
<text>Pressed wood, also known as presswood, is any engineered wood building and furniture construction material made from wood shavings and particles, sawdust or wood fibers bonded together with an adhesive under heat and pressure.
This makes it different from &quot;densified wood&quot;, which is solid wood that has been compressed to increase its strength and possibly modify other properties.

Pressed wood can also contains strips of wood veneers. Panels that are laminated from sheets of veneer are usually known as plywood.

== Manufacturing process ==

=== Preparations of the veneers ===
The creation of pressed wood begins with the veneers being placed in a rotary dryer. This dryer is typically heated with steam at around . This process prepares the veneers for the humidifying process in which the veneers are then placed into humidification chambers. These humidification chambers have a precise moisture content.

=== Applying adhesive to the veneers ===
After the veneers have been prepared, resin adhesive is applied to the top of the veneer and then rolled for equal distribution on top of the veneer. Next, another veneer with a perpendicular grain pattern is applied on top. This process is then repeated until the desired thickness of the board is met.

=== Pressing ===
Once the board is at its desired thickness, the board is placed into a press, where the board is pressed and heated. This process gives pressed wood its strength advantage over other engineered wood types.

The boards are placed in a press where the press will press down on the boards with roughly of pressure. At the same time, the boards will also be heated up to —this heat and pressure cause the adhesive to cure, forming the finished board.

== Applications of pressed wood ==

=== Construction ===
Presswood is very commonly used in the construction of houses and other buildings. Because of pressed wood&#x27;s high strength and versatility, it works very well for structural constructions.

=== Pallets ===
Pressed wood is a very common material used to make wooden pallets. This is because of how cheap pressed wood can be and how pallets can easily be constructed out of pressed wood.

=== Furniture ===
Because of pressed wood&#x27;s strength and versatility, it works very well for structural parts of furniture.

<doc id="1111315" wikidata="Q382839" url="?curid=1111315" title="Galois cohomology">
<text>In mathematics, Galois cohomology is the study of the group cohomology of Galois modules, that is, the application of homological algebra to modules for Galois groups. A Galois group &quot;G&quot; associated with a field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; acts in a natural way on some abelian groups, for example those constructed directly from &quot;L&quot;, but also through other Galois representations that may be derived by more abstract means. Galois cohomology accounts for the way in which taking Galois-invariant elements fails to be an exact functor.

== History ==

The current theory of Galois cohomology came together around 1950, when it was realised that the Galois cohomology of ideal class groups in algebraic number theory was one way to formulate class field theory, at the time it was in the process of ridding itself of connections to L-functions. Galois cohomology makes no assumption that Galois groups are abelian groups, so this was a non-abelian theory. It was formulated abstractly as a theory of class formations. Two developments of the 1960s turned the position around. Firstly, Galois cohomology appeared as the foundational layer of étale cohomology theory (roughly speaking, the theory as it applies to zero-dimensional schemes). Secondly, non-abelian class field theory was launched as part of the Langlands philosophy.

The earliest results identifiable as Galois cohomology had been known long before, in algebraic number theory and the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The normal basis theorem implies that the first cohomology group of the additive group of &quot;L&quot; will vanish; this is a result on general field extensions, but was known in some form to Richard Dedekind. The corresponding result for the multiplicative group is known as Hilbert&#x27;s Theorem 90, and was known before 1900. Kummer theory was another such early part of the theory, giving a description of the connecting homomorphism coming from the &quot;m&quot;-th power map.

In fact, for a while the multiplicative case of a 1-cocycle for groups that are not necessarily cyclic was formulated as the solubility of Noether&#x27;s equations, named for Emmy Noether; they appear under this name in Emil Artin&#x27;s treatment of Galois theory, and may have been folklore in the 1920s. The case of 2-cocycles for the multiplicative group is that of the Brauer group, and the implications seem to have been well known to algebraists of the 1930s.

In another direction, that of torsors, these were already implicit in the infinite descent arguments of Fermat for elliptic curves. Numerous direct calculations were done, and the proof of the Mordell–Weil theorem had to proceed by some surrogate of a finiteness proof for a particular &quot;H&quot;1 group. The &#x27;twisted&#x27; nature of objects over fields that are not algebraically closed, which are not isomorphic but become so over the algebraic closure, was also known in many cases linked to other algebraic groups (such as quadratic forms, simple algebras, Severi–Brauer varieties), in the 1930s, before the general theory arrived.

The needs of number theory were in particular expressed by the requirement to have control of a local-global principle for Galois cohomology. This was formulated by means of results in class field theory, such as Hasse&#x27;s norm theorem. In the case of elliptic curves, it led to the key definition of the Tate–Shafarevich group in the Selmer group, which is the obstruction to the success of a local-global principle. Despite its great importance, for example in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, it proved very difficult to get any control of it, until results of Karl Rubin gave a way to show in some cases it was finite (a result generally believed, since its conjectural order was predicted by an L-function formula).

The other major development of the theory, also involving John Tate was the Tate–Poitou duality result.

Technically speaking, &quot;G&quot; may be a profinite group, in which case the definitions need to be adjusted to allow only continuous cochains.

== Formal details ==
Galois cohomology is the study of the group cohomology of Galois groups. Let formula_1 be a field extension with Galois group formula_2 and formula_3 an abelian group on which formula_2 acts. The cohomology group:
formula_5
is the Galois cohomology group associated to the representation of the Galois group on formula_3. It is possible, moreover, to extend this definition to the case when formula_3 is a non-abelian group and formula_8, and this extension is required for some of the most important applications of the theory. In particular, formula_9 is the set of fixed points of the Galois group in formula_3, and formula_11 is related to the 1-cocycles (which parametrize quaternion algebras for instance).

When the extension field formula_12 is the separable closure of the field formula_13, one often writes instead formula_14 and
formula_15

Hilbert&#x27;s theorem 90 in cohomological language is the statement that the first cohomology group with values in the multiplicative group of formula_16 is trivial for a Galois extension formula_1:
formula_18
This vanishing theorem can be generalized to a large class of algebraic groups, also formulated in the language of Galois cohomology. The most straightforward generalization is that for any quasisplit formula_13-torus formula_20,
formula_21
Denote by formula_22 the general linear group in formula_23 dimensions. Then Hilbert 90 is the formula_24 special case of
formula_25
Likewise, the vanishing theorem holds for the special linear group formula_26 and for the symplectic group formula_27 where formula_28 is a non-degenerate alternating bilinear form defined over formula_13.

The second cohomology group describes the factor systems attached to the Galois group. Thus for any normal extension formula_1, the relative Brauer group can be identified with the group
formula_31
As a special case, with the separable closure,
formula_32

<doc id="1111325" wikidata="Q1130332" url="?curid=1111325" title="Ihram">
<text>Ihram (, from the Semitic root Ḥ-R-M) is a sacred state which a Muslim must enter to perform the Ḥajj (major pilgrimage) or ʿUmrah (minor pilgrimage) in Islam. A pilgrim must enter into this state before crossing the pilgrimage boundary known as the Miqat by performing the cleansing rituals and wearing the prescribed Ihram clothing.

== Restrictions ==

=== Wearing ===
A man in the state of &quot;ihram&quot; must not tie knots or wear stitched items. Sandals and flip-flops may be stitched, but they should allow the ankle and back of the foot to be exposed (some other schools of thought also agree that the front of the foot must be shown as well). 

In the state of ihram, men are not allowed to cover their heads or parts of it with a cloth or headwear.

In the state of ihram, women and men are prohibited from wearing gloves.

=== Scents ===
While in the state of &quot;ihram&quot;, a Muslim must not use any scents on the body or the robes. If the robe has been fouled by najas (, dirty) material or has been wiped, rubbed or touched by scented liquids (intentionally), then a new &quot;iḥrām&quot; clothing must be worn, or the Umrah or Hajj will be invalid.

=== Self-grooming ===
Aside from being as clean (purified) as they are for prayer, male Muslims are expected to cut their nails, and trim their hair and beards. They must also wear deodorant. They have to wear &quot;ihram&quot; clothing, which is a white, seamless garment. Many also shave their head as this is considered hygienic. Most will wait to shave their heads until after they have finished Umrah or Hajj, as this is a requirement to leave the state of &quot;ihram&quot;. Female Muslims are also expected to be clean. During the pilgrimage, sexual activity, smoking, and swearing are also forbidden.

=== Environment ===

It is forbidden for every pilgrim of Hajj and Umrah when in ihram to uproot, cut, break, or grind the branches of living trees in the Haramayn, the Two Sacred Places. These are Mecca and Medina (now in Saudi Arabia, and including the Masjid al-Haram, Mount Arafat, Muzdalifah, and Mina) and al-Aqsa (the region on top of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem). This is because the trees that thrive in the Haramayn are blessed.

It is forbidden for every person in ihram to hunt, shoot, kill, sacrifice, capture, confine, destroy or abuse any animal. This prohibition applies to all land animals, birds, and insects other than marine animals.

If a person accidentally steps on or kills small animals or insects, such as small black ants, grasshoppers, etc., he is not considered guilty, but he must pay a fine according to the value of the insects killed.

A person can kill animals and insects that may harm them or other pilgrims, such as mosquitoes, snakes, scorpions, and spiders. However, driving away the insect or animal first is preferable if possible.

== When flying ==
When flying on pilgrimage, appropriate measures are usually taken to assure that the pilgrim will be in the state of ihram when flying above or alongside the stations of the Miqat. For this reason some airports in Muslim areas have dedicated &quot;ihram&quot; rooms where pilgrims can change into the necessary clothing. If flying with an airline originating from a Muslim-majority country, airline staff will announce passengers should enter ihram.

<doc id="1111328" wikidata="Q1436893" url="?curid=1111328" title="Ford Model C">
<text>The Ford Model C is an automobile that was produced by Ford Motor Company. Introduced in late 1904, the Model C was Ford&#x27;s lower priced 1905 model. The first sales were in October 1904, with most sold during the 1905 calendar year. Horace Dodge made major changes to the design of the engine, rear axle and other parts of the car. The Model C used the same 10 hp motor the 1904 Model A was equipped with. Model C had a longer wheelbase than the earlier Model A. Built at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, it was the entry-level car in the Ford model lineup, slotting below the upscale Model B. Production ended in 1905 with approximately 1,000 cars produced (Canada production included). About 160-170 Model C were assembled in Canada at Ford&#x27;s new Ford Canada location in Walkerville. Due to the Dodge Brothers owning a ten percent share of the company, as well as supplying many parts and assemblies, the Model C took to the road with Dodge-built engines and other key assemblies.

The Model C engine was an opposed twin, 10 hp car, with a claimed top speed of . The Model C two-seater, sometimes marketed as a &quot;doctor&#x27;s car,&quot; sold for $850 ($ in dollars ), compared to the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout at US$650, Western&#x27;s Gale Model A at US$500, and the Success at a low US$250. It offered a four-seater option for an additional $100. The top also cost extra: rubber $30, leather $50.

Although the Model C had a protruding front &quot;hood,&quot; like a modern car, instead of the flat-front Model A, this was largely ornamental — the engine remained under the seat (the gas tank was under the hood).

The Model C was the first vehicle to be built at Ford Motor Company of Canada.

<doc id="1111331" wikidata="Q5595075" url="?curid=1111331" title="Grand Sefton Steeplechase">
<text>The Grand Sefton Handicap Chase is a National Hunt steeplechase in Great Britain which is open to horses aged six years or older. It is run at Aintree over a distance of about 2 miles and 5 furlongs (2 miles 5 furlongs and 19 yards, or 4,242 metres), and during its running there are eighteen fences to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place in November. 

It was first run over a one hundred year period from 1865 to 1965 as part of Aintree&#x27;s autumn meeting and was run over a distance of just under three miles. Originally, the Grand Sefton was one of the most important events of the autumn, but after the Second World War its popularity waned as Aintree&#x27;s fortunes foundered. In 2003, the race was revived and run on the first day of the November Becher Meeting and run over the same fences as Aintree&#x27;s most famous race, the Grand National. Prior to 2021 the race was run at Aintree&#x27;s meeting on the first Saturday in December.

<doc id="1111338" wikidata="Q1364695" url="?curid=1111338" title="Simon Gagné">
<text>Simon Gagné (; born February 29, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He played for the Philadelphia Flyers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Los Angeles Kings and Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent the first ten seasons of his NHL career with the Flyers (1999–2010), followed by one season with Tampa Bay (2010–11) and two with Los Angeles (2011–13), winning the Stanley Cup in 2012, before returning to Philadelphia via trade for the end of the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season. After not playing in 2013–14, Gagné signed with Boston, briefly playing for them before retiring in 2015.

Drafted out of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) 22nd overall in 1998, Gagné played major junior with the Beauport Harfangs and Quebec Remparts for three seasons. He began his NHL career with the Flyers in 1999 and was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. He has appeared in two NHL All-Star Games and has won two Bobby Clarke Trophies with the Flyers as team MVP.

Internationally, Gagné has represented Canada on five occasions. He has won silver medals at the 1999 World Junior Championships and 2005 World Championships, while winning gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics and a World Cup championship in 2004.

He was named general manager of the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL on June 15 2023, replacing Patrick Roy.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Gagné played in the 1993 and 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Sainte-Foy, Quebec City.

===QMJHL===
Gagné was 16 when he broke into the QMJHL as a member of the Beauport Harfangs during the 1996–97 season. Playing mostly on the third and fourth lines, Gagné finished with 31 points (9 goals and 22 assists) in 51 games. The following two seasons, he would play with the Quebec Remparts, totalling 189 points (80 goals and 109 assists) in 114 games, including a 120-point season in 1998–99. That year, he finished sixth in league scoring, was named to the QMJHL Second All-Star Team and was awarded the Paul Dumont Trophy as the &quot;personality of the year&quot;. Gagné also recorded 20 goals and 13 assists for 33 points in 25 career playoff matches with the Remparts. After the 1998–99 season, Gagné graduated to the pro ranks, and the Remparts retired Gagné&#x27;s #12 jersey during a ceremony early on in the 1999–2000 season. Gagné joined Hockey Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur as the only two players that have had their jerseys retired by the Quebec Remparts (Alexander Radulov&#x27;s number has also since been retired by the Remparts).

===Philadelphia Flyers===
Gagné was drafted 22nd overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft and made the Flyers out of training camp prior to the 1999–2000 season. His rookie season saw him play primarily at centre and score 20 goals and 28 assists in 80 games, good enough to be named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. He contributed 5 goals and 5 assists in 17 games during the playoffs before the Flyers lost in seven games to the New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference Finals.

The following season, Gagné was converted from centre to wing. Playing on a line with Mark Recchi and Keith Primeau in the 2000–01 season, Gagné scored 27 goals and 32 assists in 69 games and took part in his first NHL All-Star Game. During the All-Star Game, he scored two goals including the game-winning goal for the North American team. 2001–02 saw him score 33 goals and tally a career high 33 assists in 79 games. A nagging groin injury limited Gagné to 46 games and career lows in goals, assists and points in 2002–03. The next season, Gagné recorded 24 goals and 21 assists in 80 games. He also scored an important overtime goal in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning. However, the Flyers were eliminated in Game 7.

Once the 2004–05 NHL lockout came to an end, Gagné assumed a greater role on the Flyers and played most of the year as the left winger on the top line with Peter Forsberg and Mike Knuble. The line became known as the &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; line due to their numbers (12 [Gagné], 21 [Forsberg] and 22 [Knuble]) and Gagné responded with his best season as a pro with 47 goals and 79 points in 72 games. He was awarded the Bobby Clarke Trophy, which is awarded to the Flyers Team MVP. In the off-season, Gagné signed a five-year contract extension worth over $25 million. Despite not having Forsberg as his centre for much of the 2006–07 season due to injury and Forsberg&#x27;s eventual trade to the Nashville Predators, Gagné scored 41 goals and 27 assists in 76 games and won his second consecutive Bobby Clarke Trophy. He also played in his second NHL All-Star Game.

In the 2007–08 season, Gagné recorded 18 points in 25 games before being shut down for the year on February 20 after being told to sit out by doctors. Although it was believed Gagné had suffered three concussions in five months, he was told by doctors that he only had one and further injuries re-aggravated the symptoms. He suffered the initial concussion on October 25, 2007, when he was hit in the jaw with a check from Florida Panthers defenceman Jay Bouwmeester. Gagné sat out four games and returned only to be hurt again on November 7. After missing the next 26 games, he was re-injured on his first shift back on February 10, 2008, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Gagné follows after several previous Flyers player who have suffered serious concussions. Former captain Keith Primeau had his career ended prematurely due to concussions suffered while playing in Philadelphia, while Jeremy Roenick nearly retired after suffering one himself.
Gagné had a strong return in the 2008–09 season, scoring 34 goals, 74 points and posting a +21 in 79 games. However, injury troubles persisted in 2009–10. Less than a month into the season, he was placed on the injured reserve after being diagnosed with a double hernia in his groin in late-October 2009. Although the Flyers&#x27; orthopedic surgeon recommended surgery, Gagné opted for a second opinion with his personal doctor in Montreal. Soon after, Gagné opted for surgery, which was performed on November 3. The surgery repaired the two small hernias in his right groin laparoscopically through his belly button, while reinforcing his rectus abdominis on both sides. Gagné returned to action on December 19 against the New York Rangers after missing 24 games. He scored his third career hat trick and first career natural hat-trick just 11 days after returning from injury against the Rangers, December 30, 2009. He finished the season with 40 points in 58 games. After defeating the second-seeded New Jersey Devils in the opening round of the 2010 playoffs, in which Gagné was injured, the Flyers met the Boston Bruins in the second round. After going down three games to none in the series without Gagné, Gagné returned for Game 4, scoring the game-winning goal in overtime, then scoring two goals in Game 5. After the Flyers became just the sixth team to force a Game 7 after being down three games to none, Gagné scored the series-winning goal in the third period of Game 7 to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers became the third team in NHL history to come back from a three games to none deficit in a series and win.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
On July 19, 2010, Gagné was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Matt Walker and a fourth-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. He recorded 17 goals with 23 assists for the Lightning that year, to go with another five goals in the 2011 playoffs.

===Los Angeles Kings===
After just one season in Tampa Bay, Gagné became an unrestricted free agent. On July 2, 2011, he signed a two-year, $7 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He scored his first goal as a Kings player on October 13, 2011, against Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. During the regular season, he appeared in 34 games and scored 10 goals with 17 points overall. On June 11, 2012, he won the Stanley Cup over the Devils, along with former Flyers teammates Jeff Carter and Mike Richards. During the Kings&#x27; playoff run, he appeared in four games but did not record a point. During the off-season, he underwent surgery to remove a 5 cm mass from his neck which had been causing him chronic pain.

=== Return to Philadelphia ===

In the following 2012–13 lockout-shortened season, Gagné sparingly appeared in 11 games with the Kings before on February 26, 2013, he was traded back to Philadelphia in exchange for a conditional fourth-round draft pick. He appeared in his return to Philadelphia the following night at the Wells Fargo Center, February 27, 2013, against the Washington Capitals. In his first game back, Gagné registered his first goal of the season on a power play, assisted by Brayden Schenn and Daniel Brière, ending a 32-game goalless streak, the longest of his professional career.

=== Boston Bruins ===
After a year hiatus from professional hockey, Gagné signed a professional try-out contract with the Boston Bruins. After a successful training camp, Gagné was signed to a one-year contract with them on October 14, 2014. After scoring 3 goals in 23 games, it was announced on January 12, 2015, that Gagné would not return to the Bruins in the 2014–15 season after his father&#x27;s death in December 2014. In a possible signal of the end of his professional career, Gagné&#x27;s contract was terminated by the Bruins on January 29, 2015. On September 15, 2015, Gagné announced his retirement from professional hockey.

==Personal life==





Simon is married to Karine and has a son, Matthew, born June 2, 2009, and a daughter, Lily Rose, born February 14, 2011.

==International play==
Gagné debuted internationally with Team Canada at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Manitoba. Playing as the host country, Canada made it to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in overtime to earn the silver medal. Gagné scored seven goals and an assist in seven games to finish second in team scoring behind Daniel Tkaczuk&#x27;s 10 points.

Three years later, Gagné made his senior debut with Team Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, scoring four points in six games to help Canada to their first Olympic ice hockey gold medal in 50 years over the host country United States.

Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Gagné competed in the 2004 World Cup, where he captured his second consecutive international championship with Team Canada, contributing two points in six games. Due to the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; consistent playoff runs in the NHL, Gagné did not appear in a World Championships until 2005, with the NHL lockout still in effect. He finished the tournament with an international career-high ten points in nine games, third in team scoring behind Rick Nash and Joe Thornton as the three Canadians finished 1–2–3 in tournament scoring. However, as Canada made it to the gold medal game, they were shut-out by the Czech Republic 3–0.

The following year, Gagné was named to his second national Olympic team to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. Attempting to defend their gold medal from 2002, Canada was defeated in the quarter-finals by Russia and finished in seventh place. Gagné scored three points in five games.

He was named to the 2009 summer camp roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. On August 25, 2009, Gagné injured his groin and was forced to leave camp.

<doc id="1111339" wikidata="Q1340337" url="?curid=1111339" title="Thoracotomy">
<text>A thoracotomy is a surgical procedure to gain access into the pleural space of the chest. It is performed by surgeons (emergency physicians or paramedics under certain circumstances) to gain access to the thoracic organs, most commonly the heart, the lungs, or the esophagus, or for access to the thoracic aorta or the anterior spine (the latter may be necessary to access tumors in the spine). A thoracotomy is the first step in thoracic surgeries including lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer or to gain thoracic access in major trauma.

==Approaches==
There are many different surgical approaches to performing a thoracotomy. Some common forms of thoracotomies include:
* Posterolateral thoracotomy is the most common and traditional approach for gaining access to the chest. It is an incision through an intercostal space on the back, and is often widened with rib spreaders. Patient has to be placed in a lateral decubitus position for this approach. All pressure points should be padded. A pillow should be placed between the two legs. Both arms should be flexed and maintained in &quot;prayer position&quot;. A roll can be placed under the 5th intercostal space or the table can be broken at the same level so as to open the intercostal space widely for easy access. It is a very common approach for operations on the lung or posterior mediastinum, including the esophagus. When performed over the fifth intercostal space, it allows optimal access to the pulmonary hilum (pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein) and therefore is considered the approach of choice for pulmonary resection (pneumonectomy and lobectomy). Another variant is the &quot;muscle sparing posterolateral thoracotomy&quot; which preserves the Lattisimus Dorsi and Serratus muscles. This leads to less shoulder dysfunction and also allows for these muscles for any future use in case of a complication.
* Anterolateral thoracotomy is performed upon the anterior chest wall. The skin incision is performed starting from the posterior axillary line in front of the tip of the scapula towards the submammary crease. The anterior intercostal spaces are wider as compared to the posterior spaces hence provide better exposure while minimising the need for excess rib spreading. It gives a very adequate exposure of lungs, pericardium and diaphragm. Left anterolateral thoracotomy is the incision of choice for open chest massage, a critical maneuver in the management of traumatic cardiac arrest. 
* Bilateral anterior thoracotomy with transverse sternotomy, or clamshell incision, is the incision of choice for bilateral lung transplantation. It is also a valuable tool in trauma settings. Large mediastinal tumours extending into both hemi-thorax and bilateral pulmonary tumours are also easily accessible via a clamshell incision.
* The Ashrafian thoracotomy was devised to give rapid access to the heart and pericardium through an incision that consists of an anterior thoracic incision followed in a vertical direction along the costo-chondral (rib-cartilage) junction.

Upon completion of the surgical procedure, the chest is closed. One or more chest tubes—with one end inside the opened pleural cavity and the other submerged under saline solution inside a sealed container, forming an airtight drainage system—are necessary to remove air and fluid from the pleural cavity, preventing the development of pneumothorax or hemothorax.

==Complications==
In addition to pneumothorax, complications from thoracotomy include air leaks, infection, bleeding and respiratory failure. Postoperative pain is universal and intense, generally requiring the use of opioid analgesics for moderation, as well as interfering with the recovery of respiratory function. Paraplegia complicating thoracotomy is rare but catastrophic.

In nearly all cases, one or more chest tubes are placed. These tubes are used to drain air and fluid until the patient heals enough to take them out (usually a few days). Complications such as pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema can occur if these chest tubes become clogged. Furthermore, complications such as pleural effusion or hemothorax can occur if the chest tubes fail to drain the fluid around the lung in the pleural space after a thoracotomy. Clinicians should be on the look out for chest tube clogging as these tubes have a tendency to become occluded with fibrinous material or clot in the post operative period, and when this happens, complications ensue.

Pain following a thoracotomy may be treated by the use of a nerve block known as a rhomboid intercostal block. In the long term, post-operative chronic pain can develop, known as thoracotomy pain syndrome, and may last from a few years to a lifetime. Treatment to aid pain relief for this condition includes intra-thoracic nerve blocks/opiates and epidurals, although results vary from person to person and are dependent on numerous factors. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing persistent postoperative pain three to 18 months after thoracotomy.

==VATS==
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a less invasive alternative to thoracotomy in selected cases, much like laparoscopic surgery. There are lesser postoperative complications and better long-term survival following VATS lobectomy compared to open thoracotomy lobectomy for NSCLC. VATS lobectomy does not compromise patient safety or the oncological efficacy.

==Post-thoracotomy pain==
Thoracic epidural analgesia or paravertebral blockade have shown to be the most effective methods for post-thoracotomy pain control. However, contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia include hypovolemia, shock, increase in ICP, coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia, sepsis, or infection at puncture site. Comparing thoracic epidural analgesia and paravertebral blockade, paravertebral blockade reduced the risks of developing minor complications, however paravertebral blockade was as effective as thoracic epidural blockade in controlling acute pain. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has also shown to be useful in the management of post-thoracotomy pain. Specifically, it has been found to be a good adjunct in the management of moderate to severe post-thoracotomy pain and effective as a lone modality in mild post-thoracotomy pain (e.g. after video-assisted thoracoscopy).

<doc id="1111343" wikidata="Q284360" url="?curid=1111343" title="Elliott Erwitt">
<text>Elliott Erwitt (born Elio Romano Erwitz, July 26, 1928 – November 29, 2023) was a French-born American advertising and documentary photographer known for his black and white candid photos of ironic and absurd situations within everyday settings. He was a member of Magnum Photos from 1953.

== Early life ==
Elliott Erwitt was born in Paris, France, on July 26, 1928, to Jewish-Russian immigrant parents, Eugenia and Boris Erwitz, who soon moved to Italy. In 1939, when he was 10 years old, his family migrated to the United States. He studied photography and filmmaking at Los Angeles City College and the New School for Social Research. In 1951, he was drafted into the Army, and discharged in 1953.

== Photography career ==

Erwitt served as a photographer&#x27;s assistant in the 1950s in the United States Army while stationed in France and Germany. After moving to New York in 1948, he met the photographers Edward Steichen, Robert Capa and Roy Stryker. Stryker, the former Director of the Farm Security Administration&#x27;s photography department, hired Erwitt to work on a photography project for the Standard Oil Company. He then began a freelance photographer career and produced work for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;. Erwitt was invited to become a member of Magnum Photos by the founder Robert Capa in 1953.

Again and again he has also documented socio-political events in his photographs, such as Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to the Soviet Union in 1959, the funeral service for John F. Kennedy in 1963 or the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009.

One of the subjects Erwitt has frequently photographed in his career is dogs: they have been the subject of five of his books, &quot;Son of Bitch&quot; (1974), &quot;To the Dogs&quot; (1992), &quot;Dog Dogs&quot; (1998), &quot;Woof&quot; (2005), and &quot;Elliott Erwitt&#x27;s Dogs&quot; (2008).

Erwitt created an alter ego, the beret-wearing and pretentious &quot;André S. Solidor&quot; (which abbreviates to &quot;ass&quot;), &quot;a contemporary artist, from one of the French colonies in the Caribbean, I forget which one&quot; to &quot;satirise the kooky excesses of contemporary photography.&quot; His work was published in a book, &quot;The Art of André S. Solidor&quot; (2009), and exhibited in 2011 at the Paul Smith Gallery in London.

Erwitt was awarded the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Centenary Medal in 2002 in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography, a Royal Photographic Society Honorary Fellowship in 1994 and the International Center for Photography&#x27;s Infinity Award, Lifetime Achievement category, in 2011.

== Filmmaking career ==
From the 1970s, he devoted much of his energy toward movies. His feature films, television commercials, and documentary films included &quot;Arthur Penn: the Director&quot; (1970), &quot;Beauty Knows No Pain&quot; (1971), &quot;Red, White and Bluegrass&quot; (1973) and the prize-winning &quot;Glassmakers of Herat, Afghanistan&quot; (1977). He was, as well, credited as camera operator for &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970), still photographer for &quot;Bob Dylan: No Direction Home&quot; (2005), and provided additional photography for &quot;Get Yer Ya Ya&#x27;s Out&quot; (2009).

A collection of Erwitt&#x27;s films were screened in 2011 as part of the DocNYC Festival&#x27;s special event &quot;An Evening with Elliott Erwitt&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
In October 2020, Erwitt partnered with the digital collectible cards company Phil Ropy and created a card to raise awareness for Project HOPE&#x27;s COVID-19 response. The picture on the card shows a pair of medical rubber gloves as a reminder of how exposed health-care workers are and as an allusion to Project HOPE&#x27;s logo. The proceeds from the sales of the card are redistributed to the organization.

== Personal life ==
Erwitt was married to the German filmmaker and writer Pia Frankenberg from 1998 to 2012.

==Death==
Erwitt died at his home in New York on November 29, 2023, while sleeping. He was 95.

<doc id="1111345" wikidata="Q253239" url="?curid=1111345" title="Simone Simon">
<text>Simone Thérèse Fernande Simon (23 April 1910 or 1911 – 22 February 2005) was a French film actress who began her film career in 1931. She is perhaps best remembered for her role in the American horror film &quot;Cat People&quot;, and its sequel &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Marseille, France, she was the daughter of Henri Louis Firmin Clair Simon, a French Jewish engineer and airplane pilot in World War II who died in a concentration camp, and Erma Maria Domenica Giorcelli, an Italian housewife. Before settling and growing up in Marseille, Simon lived in Madagascar, Budapest, Turin, and Berlin. She went to Paris in 1931 and worked briefly as a singer, model, and fashion designer. She also at one point wanted to become a sculptor.

Simon worked chiefly for the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens and then managed to get more serious work with Sacha Guitry in &quot;Ô mon bel inconnu&quot;.

==Career==
After being spotted in a restaurant in June 1931, Simon was offered a film contract by director Victor Tourjansky, which ended her plans to become a fashion designer. She made her screen debut in &quot;Le chanteur inconnu&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Singer&quot;, 1931), and quickly established herself as one of the country&#x27;s most successful film actresses. Simon later told a reporter that she had no acting experience when making her first screen test for &quot;The Unknown Singer&quot;. In 1932, she was given more important roles and she rose to fame after starring in Marc Allégret&#x27;s &quot;Lac aux dames&quot; (&quot;Ladies Lake&quot;, 1934), which was in her own opinion her first serious role since &quot;The Unknown Singer&quot;. In later interviews, Simon expressed her gratitude towards Allégret, feeling that he was responsible for her glory.
After seeing her in &quot;Ladies Lake&quot;, Darryl F. Zanuck brought her to Hollywood in August 1935 with a widespread publicity campaign. Before accepting an American contract, Simon completed two more films for Allégret, &quot;Les yeux noirs&quot; (&quot;Black Eyes&quot;, 1935) and &quot;Les beaux jours&quot; (1935). It was usual for foreign actresses to receive months of preparation before working, but Simon was given only a few weeks of English lessons before she was told to report on set. Meanwhile, the studio had trouble finding her a suitable role. She was scheduled to make her American film debut in &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; (1936), playing a Spanish girl, but was replaced by Rita Hayworth. In mid-1935, she was cast in the female lead in &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936), but was discharged during production.

Although it was reported that she withdrew due to illness, it was later revealed that Zanuck fired her after twelve days of shooting because of her temperamental behavior, which displeased the film&#x27;s director Frank Lloyd. Simon herself claimed in a 1936 interview that she fell ill after weeks of tests and rehearsing for the film. She admitted, though, that in the early stage of production she was temperamental, insisting that she was inspired to behave that way after a conversation with Marlene Dietrich, who told her that &quot;a star is only as important as she makes herself out to be.&quot; She dismissed any further claims of her being rude or difficult to work with, explaining to the press that she was initially not used to the American lifestyle, which was in her view more extroverted than the French way of living. Her poor health caused her to be hospitalized, during which she became convinced to give up her American contract.

Shortly after she had decided to return to France, the studio assigned her to a third billing role in &quot;Girls&#x27; Dormitory&quot; (1936). Simon was attracted to the story and saw &quot;great possibilities&quot; in her character. Reportedly, she again showed a temperament, which led to difficulties with Ruth Chatterton, the film&#x27;s star, who felt that Simon was receiving more attention. Simon confessed that she was nervous during production, because studio executives were closely watching her every step. Although thought to be one of the highlights of the year, &quot;Girls&#x27; Dormitory&quot; was soon forgotten by the public, making Simon&#x27;s American film debut less than impressive. Nonetheless, Simon was hailed a sensation and critics applauded her performance. Furthermore, magazines reported that it brought the actress overnight fame. Shortly after the film&#x27;s release she was cast in &quot;White Hunter&quot;, a B movie that would reunite her with producer Irving Cummings. During filming, she was again stricken by flu, and she ultimately had to be replaced by actress June Lang.
Instead, the studio rushed her in the romantic comedy &quot;Ladies in Love&quot; (1936), which was filmed in mid-1936. She shared the female lead with Janet Gaynor, Loretta Young and Constance Bennett, some of whom objected to the large number of scenes that Simon was getting. It was a heavyweight lineup in which Simon&#x27;s role left her little chance to compete effectively. Trying to avoid quarrels, she hired an assistant to prevent her from making headlines with her behavior. Despite a big build-up, which included a weekly salary even though her first American film was released more than a year after her arrival in the country, Simon&#x27;s films for 20th Century Fox were only moderately successful. Among others, she was cast in the Janet Gaynor role in the 1937 remake of the silent classic &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; (1927), which co-starred James Stewart and flopped. Afterwards, she was cast in &quot;Danger – Love at Work&quot; (1937), but due to her heavy French accent she had to be replaced by Ann Sothern. Failing in finding her appropriate roles, the studio allowed her to go on an eight-week vacation to France, and following her return in June 1937, she was assigned to &quot;Suez&quot; (1938), but the project was shelved and she was eventually replaced.

In the late 1930s, Simon returned to France, dissatisfied with the development of her American film career and the backfiring of its related publicity. There, she appeared in the Jean Renoir film &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; (&quot;The Human Beast&quot;) in 1938. With the outbreak of World War II, she returned to Hollywood and worked for RKO Radio Pictures where she achieved her greatest successes in English language cinema with &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1941), &quot;Cat People&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Curse of the Cat People&quot; (1944); the latter two formed part of the horror film series produced by Val Lewton. At the time, due to her relative obscurity in the United States, Simon generated a series of apocryphal rumors about her origins, such as that she was the love child of Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst, and that she had been a Paramount stock player from Salem, Oregon. These films did not lead to greater success and she languished in mediocre films until the end of the war.

She returned to France to act, and appeared in &quot;La Ronde&quot; (&quot;Roundabout&quot;, 1950). Her film roles were few after this and she made her final film appearance in 1973.

==Personal life and death==

Simon never married. It was alleged by her secretary that she gave a gold key to her boudoir to any man she was interested in, including George Gershwin. The film historian, Greg Mank, reports in his audio commentary for the DVD of &quot;Cat People&quot;, the secretary was then on trial for extorting money from her employer, and her word on this matter cannot be taken at face value (the secretary was later convicted, and the terms of her probation required that she never speak of the &quot;gold key&quot; scandal again). In the 1950s, Simon was romantically involved with the French banker and racehorse owner–breeder Alec Weisweiller whose wife Francine was one of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s patrons.

She was at one time in a relationship with World War II double agent Duško Popov, codenamed &quot;Tricycle&quot;. Simon died in Paris, France, on 22 February 2005 from natural causes. A few days later, French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres issued a statement in which he extolled Simon&#x27;s &quot;charm, her irresistible smile ... With Simone Simon&#x27;s passing, we have lost one of the most seductive and most brilliant stars of the French cinema of the first half of the 20th century.&quot; In 2011, British actor and writer Stephen Mosley paid tribute to her in his acclaimed book of strange tales &quot;The Boy Who Loved Simone Simon&quot;.

<text>The Qatar national football team (), nicknamed &quot;The Maroons&quot;, represents Qatar in international football, and is controlled by the Qatar Football Association, which is affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and comes under the global jurisdiction of world football’s governing body FIFA. They play their home games at Khalifa International Stadium and Jassim bin Hamad Stadium. The latter is considered the home stadium.

The team won the Arabian Gulf Cup in 1992, 2004 and 2014. They have appeared in ten Asian Cup tournaments and won it twice in 2019 and 2023, beating Japan, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea in the process during 2019, conceding just one goal.

Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup and therefore qualified automatically for what was their first appearance in the event. It was the first time an Arab nation hosted the competition. On 25 November 2022, Qatar were the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup; subsequently, they became the worst performing host nation in the history of the FIFA World Cup, losing every game.

Qatar has footballing rivalries with Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.

==History==
===Pre-1970===
Football was brought to Qatar during a time which coincided with initial discovery of oil reserves in Dukhan in 1940. By 1948, expatriate oil workers played the first official football match in Qatar. The Qatar Football Association was formed in 1960, and the QFA joined FIFA in 1963. Simultaneously during this period, the Bahrain Football Association were drawing up plans for the establishment of a regional football competition within the GCC and Qatari officials were involved with the corroboration of this proposal. The plans came to fruition and in March 1970 the Arabian Gulf Cup was inaugurated.

===1970–1980===
The Qatar national team played its first official match on 27 March 1970 against hosts Bahrain, losing 1–2 as Mubarak Faraj scored the sole goal for Qatar. The newly formed Qatar national team posted underwhelming results in the first Gulf Cup tournament, coming in last place with a single point, with the highlight of their tournament being a 1–1 draw with the Saudis in their final match.

In the next edition of the Gulf Cup in 1972, Qatar was again relegated to last place after suffering 3 straight defeats. The next tournament in 1974 proved to be somewhat of a break-through for the Qataris as they achieved their first triumph in international football with a 4–0 victory over Oman. The Qataris lost out to Saudi Arabia in the semi-finals, but achieved a 3rd place standing after emerging the victors of a penalty shoot-out against the United Arab Emirates.

The first time they entered the qualifying stages for the AFC Asian Cup was in 1975. They were not successful in qualifying for the 1976 Asian Cup, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia booking the group&#x27;s two qualifying berths. Despite this setback, Qatar finished in 3rd place in the 1976 Gulf Cup as the host nation the next year.

The national team played its first FIFA World Cup qualifying match in 1977. Qatar was set to play the United Arab Emirates on 11 March 1977, but the last minute withdrawal of the Emirati team from the competition merely postponed Qatar&#x27;s debut until two days later when Bahrain were defeated 2–0 in Doha.

===1980–1990===
Their Asian Cup debut came in 1980 under head coach Evaristo de Macedo. They had qualified for the tournament after topping a relatively easy group composing of Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Their showing in the main tournament was unimpressive, making an early exit from the group stages with two defeats, one draw and one win.

Qatar narrowly lost to Iraq in the finals of the 1984 Gulf Cup, nonetheless they were named runners-up, their most impressive accolade until 1992.

They failed to make it out of the preliminary stages of the 1982 and 1986 World Cup qualifying rounds. However, the team qualified for both the 1984 and 1988 editions of the Asian Cup. They fell short of qualifying for the semi-finals of the 1984 tournament, with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Mohaisen Al-Jam&#x27;an&#x27;s 88th-minute goal against Kuwait ensuring a semi-final position for both teams. They also missed out on a semi-final place in 1988; however, they notably defeated Japan by a score of 3–0.

===1990–2000===
Qatar arguably reached its peak in the 1990s, attaining its highest-ever FIFA rating (53) in August 1993. Qatar started off with an emphatic qualifying campaign for the 1990 World Cup, finishing at the top of their group. They were denied a spot in the World Cup after finishing below the United Arab Emirates and South Korea in the final round of the qualifiers.

In 1990, the national team once again finished runners-up in the Gulf Cup as Kuwait won the final two matches of the tournament. Two years later, they won the competition on home soil for the first time under the leadership of Sebastião Lapola, despite a 1–0 loss against Saudi Arabia in their final game. Their star player at the time, Mubarak Mustafa, won both the top scorer and man of the tournament awards. They were also named runners-up in the 1996 Gulf Cup.

Qatar reached the Asian Zone&#x27;s final qualifying round for France 1998. After wins against China and Iran, they played their last match against Saudi Arabia, where a victory would have earned qualification. However, they lost out as Saudi Arabia won 1–0 to reach the finals.

As 1998 Arab Cup hosts, they finished runners-up to Saudi Arabia.

===2000–2010===
They made it to the quarter-finals of the 2000 Asian Cup despite finishing 3rd in their group, but lost to China in their quarter-final confrontation.

They reached the final qualifying round again in 2001 but were defeated by Bora Milutinovic&#x27;s China team, who topped the section to progress to their first FIFA World Cup. Frenchman Philippe Troussier took the manager&#x27;s job after the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, but was unsuccessful in both the 2004 Asian Cup and the qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup in Germany.

Troussier was sacked after the World Cup qualifying campaign, and under Bosnian Džemaludin Mušović, the team won the Gulf Cup in 2004 and the Asian Games gold in 2006. Mušović stepped down after Qatar only earned two points from three matches in the 2007 Asian Cup.

The job of coaching the team in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup fell to Jorge Fossati, who led the team throughout the first and second AFC rounds up to the third round. After leaving them at the top of their group with only two played matches, Fossati had to undergo stomach surgery. Subsequently, the Qatar Football Association ended their cooperation with him in September 2008, as the QFA claimed he needed too long to recover from surgery. Bruno Metsu was called up for the job, but Qatar failed to qualify after finishing fourth in their qualifying group.

===2010–2020===

Qatar was announced as hosts of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in December 2010.

In 2011, as hosts of the 2011 Asian Cup, they advanced to the quarter-finals. They succumbed to a late 2–3 defeat to eventual champions Japan after a goal was scored by Masahiko Inoha in the 89th minute.

Also as hosts, they went on to win the 2013 WAFF Championship after defeating Jordan 2–0 in the final. The competition was made up primarily of youth and reserve teams, of which Qatar&#x27;s was the latter. Djamel Belmadi, the head coach of the B team, replaced Fahad Thani as the head coach of the senior team as a result of the team&#x27;s positive performances. 10 months later, Djamel Belmadi led Qatar to gold in the 2014 Gulf Cup. They advanced from the group stages after three draws, going on to defeat Oman 3–1 in the semi-final, and were victorious in the final against Saudi Arabia, who was playing in front of a home crowd, by a margin of 2–1.

Despite winning the Gulf Cup and finishing the year 2014 with only one defeat, Qatar showed poor form in the 2015 Asian Cup. Qatar was defeated 1–4 by the United Arab Emirates in their opener. This was continued with a 0–1 loss to Iran and 1–2 to Bahrain. Qatar was eliminated in the group stages with no points and placed 4th in Group C.

Qatar&#x27;s campaign in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia was a surprise. Their start in the second round of World Cup qualifying in the AFC was nearly perfect, with seven wins and only one loss. However, their success in the second round didn&#x27;t follow them to the third round. Qatar finished bottom of their group, ensuring they would play their first World Cup match on home soil in 2022, the first team to do so since Italy in 1934.

Qatar continued its poor form in the 2017 Gulf Cup, which was hosted by Kuwait. Qatar opened the tournament with a 4–0 win against Yemen, but that was followed by a 1–2 loss to Iraq and an unconvincing 1–1 draw to Bahrain. Qatar took third place in Group B with four points and was eliminated in the group stage of the competition, which was considered an upsetting of the tournament, especially after winning the 2014 edition.
However, Qatar had an excellent campaign at the 2019 Asian Cup. Their opener saw them defeat Lebanon 2–0. This was followed by a 6–0 thrashing of North Korea and a 2–0 win against three-time champions Saudi Arabia, which sealed the team getting first place in the group. They had a 1–0 win against Iraq in the Round of 16 and a late win against defending runners-up South Korea in the quarter-finals, seeing them through to the semi-finals for the first time ever, where they defeated the hosts United Arab Emirates 4–0 to set up a final against 4-time winners Japan. Qatar ended up winning the final 3–1 over Japan, marking their first-ever major tournament title in their history, and capping off one of the most improbable Asian Cup runs in the tournament&#x27;s history, especially since they conceded only one goal in all their games. 
Qatar was invited to the 2019 Copa América. They were placed in Group B with Colombia, Argentina and Paraguay. Their first game was against Paraguay where they came back from a 2–0 deficit to tie it 2–2 but marked for the first time Qatar suffered more than one goal in any major competition since winning the Asian Cup in UAE. It was followed by a 0–1 loss to Colombia, ending the team&#x27;s undefeated streak in any major competition to eight. A 0–2 loss to Argentina meant Qatar took the last place in Group B with a single point and was eliminated in the group stage of the competition.

=== 2020–present ===
Despite Qatar had automatic qualification for the World Cup 2022, they had to play the AFC qualifiers in the second round. Qatar was invited for the first time to the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They played in Group D with Honduras, Panama and Grenada. In December 2020, UEFA invited Qatar to play friendlies against the teams in Group A of the 2022 World Cup qualifying group – Azerbaijan, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland and Serbia – as five teams in one group means one team will not be playing on any given match day. These friendlies did not count in the qualifying group standings. Qatar played their &quot;home&quot; matches in Europe in order to allow short travel times for their opponents.

In the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Qatar claimed 7 points in Group D. Their debut was against Panama with a 3–3 draw, ensuring them their first point. This was followed by a 4–0 victory over Grenada and a 2–0 win over Honduras ensuring a quarter-final place where they would face El Salvador, ultimately securing a semi-final place against the United States with a 3–2 win. However, against the hosts with its squad made up of the majority of MLS players, Qatar failed to find the way to the net, in spite of having a penalty in the 60th minute, ultimately conceding a late goal from Gyasi Zardes to end Qatar&#x27;s campaign with a 1–0 loss. In the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, Qatar won all of its group-stage matches and faced UAE, winning 5–0. They lost 2–1 in the semi-final against Algeria, eventually placing 3rd.

Despite the very successful performance of Qatar in various major tournaments, the 2022 FIFA World Cup held at home proved to be a nightmare for the Qataris. Being automatically drawn into the Group A as hosts, Qatar started with a 0–2 loss to Ecuador in the opening match, conceding two goals in the first half from Enner Valencia, making Qatar the first host country to lose their opening game. The situation did not improve for the Qataris in their second meeting with Senegal, when the Africans beat the Qataris 3–1 to condemn the hosts to an early World Cup exit, becoming the second host country after South Africa, the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosts, to have such an unwanted record (although they were eliminated only on inferior goal differences to Mexico after three matches); they became the first host team to be eliminated after two group games and guaranteed to be the worst-host ever, although Ghanaian-born Mohammed Muntari became Qatar&#x27;s first World Cup scorer in this game. With Qatar&#x27;s elimination confirmed, the hosts then fell to the Netherlands 0–2, making an unwanted record as the first hosts to score the fewest goals (1), the first to lose all three group games, and the lowest-ranked team in the tournament (ranked 32nd).

14 months later, they would redeem themselves at the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, also held at home. The Maroons defeated Lebanon 3–0 to start off their campaign, and they entered the round of 16 as group winners following 2 other successes, all without conceding a goal. They had to overcome Palestine (2–1) and then Uzbekistan in the next round (1–1 a.e.t., 3 p.s.o. to 2) to reach the last four, but without convincing. After defeating Iran 3–2 in a dramatic semifinal match, they would face off against Jordan in the final, where a penalty hat-trick by Akram Afif helped Qatar defeat Jordan 3–1 to clinch their second successive AFC Asian Cup, becoming the first team since Japan to successfully defend their title.

==Rivalries==
=== Bahrain ===

Qatar has a major rivalry against Bahrain due to historical tension between the two countries. With 39 matches played, the overall record favours Bahrain, who won 11 matches, lost 8, and tied 19. From 2004 until 2021, Qatar suffered a winless streak over Bahrain with six defeats and ten draws before finally registering a win in the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The rivalry with United Arab Emirates is a competitive one in the Arabian Gulf Cup meeting on multiple occasions, due to the 2017–2021 Qatar diplomatic crisis, increasing tensions had been witnessed, with the captain of UAE under-19 youth team refusing to shake hands with Qatar&#x27;s youth captain in 2018 AFC U-19 Championship held in Indonesia; in this tournament, the UAE beat Qatar 2–1 but still crashed out from the group stage while Qatar would recover to qualify for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup. As of 2020, Qatar and UAE have played 31 official matches, most of which was held competitively in the Arabian Gulf Cup, it started off with the United Arab Emirates beating Qatar 1–0. They only played 2 friendly games and the last friendly was held in 2011 which ended with an Emirati victory. In the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, hosted by the UAE, Qatar overran the UAE for the first time since 2001 with a result of 4–0, with heavy tensions occurring between the two teams and Emirati supporters cheering anti-Qatari chants.

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Qatar has a major rivalry against Saudi Arabia due to historical tension between the two countries and the 2017–2021 Qatar diplomatic crisis. Qatar has an overall negative record against Saudi Arabia; with 41 matches played, Qatar has won 8 matches, lost 17, and tied 16.

===Naturalised players===
While it is reasonably common for footballers to represent national teams other than their birth nations, the nature and extent of the practice for the Qatari team have been the subject of scrutiny and criticism at various points during the 21st century. In the early 1970s, shortly after the formation of the national team, the QFA revealed that it had naturalized its first players in a February 1976 telegram sent to FIFA: Ezzuldin Osman of Sudan, Hassan Mukhtar of Egypt and Ryad Murad of Lebanon. This practice of naturalizing Arabic-speaking foreigners to compete for the national team continued throughout the 20th century, albeit at a relatively slow rate. In 2004, FIFA cited the intention of three Brazilian players – Aílton, Dedé and Leandro – to play for the Qatar national team as the immediate trigger to their decision to tighten eligibility rules to ensure players have ties to the country they represent.

While Qatari authorities described it as a humanitarian effort and a way to provide competition for native Qatari players, critics claimed that it was merely another exploitative way of acquiring naturalized players, with &quot;Vice&quot; linking it to human rights abuses and the kafala system. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and Qatar announced the removal of the Kafala on 12 December 2016; the law came into effect in 2018. The reform took place between UN&#x27;s International labor organization and the state of Qatar and was proven to be the part of many said assurances that nation has claimed for the 2022 World Cup. Though claimed by independent bodies of Qatar foundering to achieve the same, both sides had agreed to revise previous acts that had been taken. To make this all possible, the hosting country declared to pay compensation for the deaths of its migrant workers on 12 August 2022.

Job changes between September 2020 and March 2022, the establishment of a nondiscriminatory wage system for all workers in March 2021, and workers&#x27; funds and insurance policies in the workplace are all data that showcased the functioning of the state for its workers.

In the 2015 friendly against Algeria, six of the eleven players in the starting team were born outside of Qatar. Then-president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, warned Qatar that FIFA would monitor their player selection to ensure that they were not relying too heavily on naturalised players. He made comparisons to the Qatar men&#x27;s national handball team, referring to the team&#x27;s selection for the 2015 World Men&#x27;s Handball Championship as an &quot;absurdity&quot;. The following year, naturalized players formed the backbone of the team and were sufficiently integral that head coach Jorge Fossati threatened to resign if they were removed.

The reliance on naturalised players has subsequently reduced, with only two members of the squad that beat Switzerland in a 2018 friendly being born outside Qatar. However, at the 2019 Asian Cup, amidst diplomatic tensions between the two countries, the United Arab Emirates Football Association lodged a formal complaint against Qatar, alleging that Almoez Ali and Bassam Al-Rawi were not eligible to play for them. These complaints were dismissed by the AFC.

Of the 26 players called up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 10 players were born outside of Qatar.

<text>The Central Directorate of Public Security (DCSP) () is the uniformed patrol and response arm of the French National Police (&quot;Police Nationale&quot;) responsible for keeping the peace and maintaining public order in the cities and large towns of France. Established on 23 April 1941, and its current structure operates under the Decree of 23 December 1993Aleksander Olech, French and Polish fight against terrorism, Poznan 2022, p. 90; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359135918_French_and_Polish_fight_against_terrorism.

The DCSP consists of over 78,000 mainly uniformed police personnel known as &quot;Gardiens de la Paix&quot; (&quot;Guardians of the Peace&quot;) deployed in 102 Départemental directorates with 462 Urban Offices. They provide general police services, including crime prevention, patrol, and response to calls for assistance. It maintains a small plainclothes corps who investigates local crimes; these are organised into Criminal Brigades.

The DCSP also deploys 9 &quot;Groupes d&#x27;Intervention de la Police Nationale&quot; (GIPN), intervention units similar to the &quot;Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion&quot; (RAID) team (which is directly under orders of the &quot;Direction Générale de la Police Nationale&quot;).

There are also dog units, boat units, and an air wing.

<doc id="1111355" wikidata="Q3241753" url="?curid=1111355" title="Route number">
<text>A route (or road) number, designation or abbreviation is an identifying numeric (or alphanumeric) designation assigned by a highway authority to a particular stretch of roadway to distinguish it from other routes and, in many cases, also to indicate its classification (e.g. motorway, primary route, regional road, etc.), general geographical location (in zonal numbering systems) and/or orientation (north-south v. east-west). The numbers chosen may be used solely for internal administrative purposes; however, in most cases they are also displayed on roadside signage and indicated on maps.
== Prefixes ==
Letters are often used in road designations to indicate a class of roadways. Within such a class, roads are distinguished from each other by a road number. The way such letters are used depends on the country or other political jurisdiction which contains and controls the road. For instance, among A1 motorways, the one in Spain has a hyphen between the A and the 1 (Autovia A-1) while in Germany the Autobahn 1 is written A 1, with a space between the A and the 1. In Argentina there are zeros between the A and the 1 (Autopista A001).

* III: third-class roads in Czechia and Slovakia (district roads, owned by regions), third-class roads in Bulgaria

While in Czechia and Slovakia, the Roman numeral is followed by a slash, Bulgaria uses a hyphen.

== By country ==
Depending on the country, the letter attributed to a road may be part of a road grading system, be a shortening for a type of road especially in a foreign language or refer to a geographical zoning system, such as the Appalachian Development Highway System or the county highway systems of California, Iowa, and Michigan in the United States.

=== International systems ===
* AH roads in the Asian Highway Network
* CA-: highways part of the Central American highway network
* E roads in the International E-road network in Europe
* EV: long-distance cycling routes in the EuroVelo network of Europe
* TAH: highways part of the Trans-African Highway network

===Australia=== 

In Australia, road routes are allocated along sections of named roads, often along parts of multiple roads. Unlike many other countries, most highways in Australia tend to be referred to only by their names. State road authorities have separate numbering systems, for internal use only.

The first route marking system was introduced to Australia in the 1950s. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes – the most important road links in the country. National Route 1 was designated to a circular route around the Australian coastline. A state route marking system was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. Alphanumeric routes were introduced in Tasmania in 1979, and during the 1990s, planning began for nationally consistent route markings, using the alphanumeric system. Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.

====National Routes and Highways====
In 1955, the Australian National Route Numbering System was introduced to simplify navigation across Australia. The National Route Numbers are marked by white shields that are present in directional signs, distance signs or trailblazers. The general rule was that odd-numbered highways travel in north–south directions and even-numbered highways in east–west directions, with only a few exceptions. National Route 1 was assigned to a network of highways and roads, which together linked all capital cities and coastal towns circumnavigating the mainland. The National Route system initially linked the centres of towns and cities and terminated at the junction of other national routes, however many bypasses have been constructed since then. National Routes often terminated at the metropolitan city limits rather than the individual city centres.

In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, with the introduction of the National Highway. These highways were marked with distinctive green and gold route marker shields instead of the plain National Route shield. Though the National Highway system has been superseded in subsequent legislation, National Highway route markers are still used on many of the routes. Additionally, National Highways and National Routes have been phased out, or are in the process of being phased out, in all states and territories except Western Australia, in favour of the alphanumeric system.

====State Routes====
Important urban and inter-regional routes not covered by the National Highway or National Route systems are marked under the State Route system. They can be recognised by blue shield markers. They were practically adopted in all states by the end of the 1980s, and in some states, some less important National Routes were downgraded to State Routes. Each state has or had its own numbering scheme, but do not duplicate National Route numbers in the same state, or nearby routes in another state.
As with the National Routes and National Highways, State Routes are being phased out in most states and territories in favour of alphanumeric routes. However, despite the fact that Victoria has fully adopted alphanumeric routes in regional areas, state route numbers are still used extensively within the city of Melbourne as a part of its Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme.

====Metroads====

In the 1990s in Sydney and Brisbane, urban route numbering system were streamlined under the Metroad scheme. Metroad route numbers were assigned to the key navigational corridors, along ring and radial routes, and marked by distinctive hexagonal shields. Most Metroads have been completely or partially replaced with alphanumeric routes in Brisbane with currently only have 2 routes; Metroad 2 and Metroad 5, and they have been fully replaced by alphanumerics in Sydney.

====Alphanumeric routes====
Tasmania introduced an alphanumeric route numbering system in 1979, based on the British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow numbered routes. National Highway 1 was retained as the only route without an alphanumeric designation.
In the 1990s Victoria and South Australia also overhauled their systems. While South Australia discarded the National and State Route Numbering Systems, those shield-based schemes were retained in the Melbourne metropolitan area as the Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme. The route numbers used in the alphanumeric schemes were generally inherited from the original National Route Numbering System, with only a few exceptions, and prefixed with letters denoting their grade. For example, Western Freeway is M8 until Ballarat and continues beyond as A8 Western Highway. They are not used extensively in the Melbourne metropolitan area where the blue-shield metropolitan route system is retained for most routes. (They were phased out for motorways in the early 2010s. New alphanumeric numbers are appearing for other new roads, and cover plates for signs, possibly pointing to a future phase-out of the metropolitan route system altogether.) The National Highways were retained, but with the route numbers changed to alphanumeric designations (later to be passively phased out since 2014).

New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory introduced the alphanumeric system from early 2013. Before being officially announced, new road signs were fitted with such numbers and then being &quot;coverplated&quot; with the existing route number. However, the new system does not distinguish between the former National Highways and other routes.

Alphanumeric routes have also been introduced for many major highways and urban routes in Queensland, although many other roads retain markers from the National Route, National Highway, State and Metroad numbering systems. According to the New South Wales Roads &amp; Maritime Services, the Northern Territory has similarly begun converting their numbered routes to alphanumeric routes, with a &quot;progressive replacement&quot; scheme that sees alphanumeric route markers introduced only when signs are replaced. There are no plans to introduce an alphanumeric route numbering system in Western Australia.

=====Prefix letters=====
In the alphanumeric systems, a letter denoting the route&#x27;s construction standard and function is prefixed to the route number, creating an alphanumeric route designation. One of six letters may be used:
* &quot;M&quot; routes are primary traffic routes, called motorways in some states. These are typically dual carriageway, freeway-standard highways, but may also be used for rural roads that are nearly at freeway-standard, or at least are dual carriageways.
* &quot;A&quot; routes are other primary highways, including urban arterials and interstate or interregional single carriageways.
* &quot;B&quot; routes are less significant routes, either as an alternative to an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;M&quot; route, or linking smaller population centres to larger regional centres, but without being a major through-route in the region. These are the major road links in areas without &quot;A&quot; routes.
* &quot;C&quot; routes link smaller settlements and towns to the rest of the major road network. They are used for roads without the significance of an &quot;M&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;B&quot; route, but where numbering would assist navigation.
* &quot;D&quot; routes are detour routes for motorways. There are only two of them, D1 and D5
* &quot;R&quot; routes are ring routes in South Australia. There is only one route, R1

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria uses prefix A for highways A1–A7 and Roman numerals I, II, III (followed by a hyphen) for the first-, second- and third-class roads. First-class numbers are single-digit, second-class road numbers are double-digit, third-class road numbers are three-digit or four-digit.

===Canada===

The Trans-Canada Highway system is made up of a series of provincially maintained highways, and is one of only two systems (the other being the Crowsnest Highway) that uses route numbering that spans multiple provinces, albeit not across the entire country. The provincial highways are assigned numbers by their respective provinces.

====Alberta====
All provincial highways are &#x27;Primary Highways&#x27;. They are divided into two series&#x27;, and sub-series&#x27;.
*1-216 Series — core highway network
**Hwy 1-100 — intercity
**Hwy 201, 216 — orbital routes
*500-986 Series — local highways
**Hwy 500-699 — west–east routes
**Hwy 700-899 — south–north routes
**900 and X series — potential realignments and extensions

====British Columbia====
Owing to the mountainous terrain in the province, route numbers are assigned on a mostly ad hoc basis, and vary between west–east and south–north routes. They currently span from 1-118, except for Hwy 395 which is a counterpart of US 395. Some routes are grouped in numerical patterns (e.g. Highways 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 are north–south routes with values increasing by increments of two moving West). British Columbia formerly had &quot;400 series&quot; of highways similar to Ontario, but that scheme was dropped in 1973.

====Manitoba====
Provincial Trunk Highways (PTH) are divided into two series&#x27;.

*Route 200-399 — collector highways
*Scenic Routes are unnumbered
*Local roads are unnumbered

====Ontario====
Provincial highways are divided into four classes.
*Hwy 2-148, 400-427 — King&#x27;s (primary) highways
**Hwy 2-148 — intercity
**400-series highways (freeways)
*Hwy 500-699 — secondary highways

*Autoroutes - expressways
** Route numbers for bypasses and spurs take on a prefix (4nn-9nn)
*100-series — primary highways
*Secondary routes
**200-series — south of the Saint Lawrence River
**300-series — north of the Saint Lawrence River

====Saskatchewan====
Provincial highways are divided into three series&#x27;, and sub-series&#x27;.
*Hwy 1-99 — primary highways
*Hwy 100-399 — secondary highways which are spurs of primary highways
**Hwy 102-167 — northern routes

There are a number of roads and highways in Nunavut, none are yet numbered.

====Yukon====
There are currently fourteen territorial highways in Yukon. All fourteen are named and numbered 1-11, 14-15, &amp; 37.

===China===
====Expressways====


National expressways of China are designated with letter G (for 国家高速, &quot;guójiā gāosù&quot;) followed by 1, 2, or 4 digits. For national expressways, one-digit numbers are used for expressways starting in Beijing. Two-digit odd numbers from G11 to G89 are for north–south long-distance expressways, and even numbers from G10 to G90 are for east–west long-distance expressways. Numbers G91 – G99 denote regional ring routes. Four-digit numbers indicate city ring routes, spur routes and parallel routes. The first two numbers indicates their parent routes, while for the three types of routes, the third digit is 0, an odd number, or an even number, respectively. Provincial city ring routes, spur routes uses two digits. For example, in G15 (Shanghai Ring Expressway), &quot;15&quot; refers to the G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway, which passes through Shanghai, and &quot;0&quot; indicates that the route is a city ring expressway.

Provincial expressways are designated with letter S (for 省高速, &quot;shěng gāosù&quot;) followed by 1 or 2 digits. Similar to the national expressways, one-digit numbers are used for routes starting in the provincial capital. Since 2017, the Chinese route naming standard no longer designates provincial expressways with 4 digit numbers.

====Non-expressways====

*G, followed by 3 digits, stand for &quot;guódào&quot; (), or China National Highways. S routes stand for &quot;shěngdào&quot; (), or provincial roads.
**Roads 101 – 199 radiates from Beijing (G roads) or the provincial capital (S roads).
**Roads 201 – 299 are north–south highways.
**Roads 301 – 399 are east–west highways.
**Roads 501 – 599 are spur routes.
*County roads (&quot;xiàndào&quot;, ) are prefixed with letter X. Township roads (&quot;xiāngdào&quot;, ) are prefixed with letter Y. Village roads (&quot;cūndào&quot;, ) are prefixed with letter C. Special roads (&quot;zhuānyòng dàolù&quot;, ) are prefixed with letter Z.

=== Czechia and Slovakia ===

The numbering system of highways and road routes in Czechia and Slovakia is based on the original Czechoslovak system. Around 1946, first-class roads got their numbers 1–68. Numbers 1–60 belonged to Czech roads, 61–68 to Slovak roads. In 1950, an ordinance was issued (1199/1949 Ú.l.I) that divided roads into three classes, traditionally denoted by Roman numerals I (state roads), II (regional roads), III (district roads). However, the system of numbering roads of all classes was nationwide. Each route number was unique and one road could pass through several regions or districts under one number. Municipal roads were not included in the uniform numbering system. 

The number of digits of the route number corresponded to the road class. Class I roads had 1 or 2 digits, class II always 3 digits, class III 4 or 5, exceptionally 6 digits. On directional traffic signs, identification plates of bridge objects or in maps, the route number is given without a prefix. In texts, official decisions and announcements, the route number is usually preceded by a class designation with a slash (I/67, II/102, III/00425). At class I or II, the route branch can be supplemented with a letter suffix (capital letter), e.g. 8H can be a branch of the route 8, or 102A can be a branch of the route 102 – however, this index is not shown on regular maps or road signs. If the suffix letter (lowercase letter) is used for III-class road (III/10107a), the route marked in this way is a separate route and the letter suffix is an integral part of the route number.

Route numbers of I and II classes are sequential, meaningless. Some patterns can be traced to how the numbers were originally assigned by direction and area, but newly assigned or changed numbers may violate these patterns. Numbers of III-class routes are always derived from the number of some I-class or II-class route. The first three digits always indicate a reference route of a higher class, which means that I-class numbers are always supplemented by leading zeros to the three-digit number (III/0041 and III/00425a are both derived from I/4, and the number III/3259 is followed by III/32510). When I-class or II-class routes are renumbered or recategorized, III-class route numbers do not usually change because of this, i.e. they can refer to historical numbering, not to the current one.

Although plans and attempts to build highways in the area of Czechoslovakia had been made in the past, the first section of the modern highway network was opened on July 12, 1971. Highway numbers are mostly derived from I-class routes, which they replaced, e.g. road I/5 was replaced by highway D5. Highway numbers are usually indicated with the prefix D (D1, D47), in directional traffic signs they are indicated without a prefix and are distinguished only by the red color of the background. However, the highway number cannot be confused with the corresponding I-class road number, for example, the D8 highway goes in a different direction than the I/8 road. The prefix D is derived from the word &quot;dálnice/dialnica&quot;, which is abbreviation of &quot;long-distance road&quot;, the substantive &quot;dálka&quot; means &quot;a (long) distance&quot;. 

Markings with the R prefix for &quot;expressways&quot; (rychlostní silnice, the word &quot;rychlost&quot; means &quot;a velocity&quot;) were also used in the road network maps and strategic documents. R-roads did not have a separate numbering system, but they were sections of ordinary I-class roads, but in construction parameters and with a traffic regime similar to highways. 

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the numbering systems of the two successor states (Czechia and Slovakia) became independent, but both continued to follow the Czechoslovak numbering system. 

The numbering system in Czechia remained in principle unchanged. However, especially during the partial changes in 1997, some numbers that originally belonged to Slovakia, especially from the 60s series, were used for I-class roads in Czechia, so they are duplicated compared to Slovakian numbers. The highways were renumbered so that the Slovak D1 highway no longer connects to the Czech D1 highway. Slovakia also started to use numbers for its roads that were originally used in Czechia. In Slovakia, a separate numbering system for expressways (R-roads) was created, with numbers R1 – R8. 

As of January 1, 2016, the highway network was reformed in the Czech Republic. The main change was that most sections of R-roads (expressways) were recategorized to highways and the R prefix has fallen into disuse for the remaining ones as well. 

In Slovakia, numbering of III-class routes underwent two reforms. First, in connection with the digitization of the road database, the way of writing third-class road numbers was changed so that in the data outputs all these numbers were complemented to six digits by inserting zeros, e.g. III/5196 to III/519006, however, the old numbering was also used at the same time. As of May 1, 2015, all Slovak III-class routes were renumbered to completely new four-digit numbers, while an interval is reserved for individual districts within which the numbers are assigned. E.g., III/063054 (referring to I/63) was renumbered to III/1460 (numbers starting with 145, 146, 147 belong to Komárno District).

In Czechia, there is also a national system of cycling route numbering. It is quite independent on road route numbering. Number of digits (1–4) corresponds to the route class, ie. one-digit numbers are for I-class long-distance routes, while 4-digits numbers for local IV-class routes. On the roads, cycling routes are marked with specific official orange-black directional road signs, and for local and off-road routes, stripe marks derived from Czech Hiking Markers System are used (with orange margin stripes instead of white ones). The guarantor of the numbering system is Czech Tourist Club. In addition, there are many local routes not included in this system.

=== Finland ===

The classification and numbering system of state-maintained roads of Finland is as follows:
*Main roads Class I (; ): 1–39 (between major cities) 
*Main roads Class II (; ): 40–99 (between regional centers) 
*Regional roads (; ): 100–999 (between large municipalities or alternate routes) 
*Connecting roads (; ): 1000–9999 (connecting to a larger road) 
*Local roads (; ): 11000–19999 (between villages cf. farm-to-market road)
Streets are maintained by the local municipality. Winter maintenance of roads and streets is managed by a local authority. Regional roads and connecting roads cf. county highways and roads. Main roads cf. Interstates or U.S. routes. 

All main roads and almost all regional roads are paved. They are generally wider than . About half of the connecting and local roads are paved. They are generally narrower, and oncoming traffic is a potential hazard, despite the general speed limit of . Connecting and local roads are usually not marked with numbers, but just with ordinary traffic signs.

====Highways====
The main highways are all paved and have at least two lanes; they are better maintained than &quot;main&quot; and &quot;regional&quot; roads. Highways numbered from 1 to 7 radiate from the capital Helsinki (Highways 2, 5 and 6 diverge from 1, 4 and 7, respectively), while highways 8 to 10 radiate from Turku on the south-western coast of Finland. Highways 11 and 12 originate in Tampere. The rest of the highways start from other major cities.

Sections of highway between major cities have often been upgraded to motorways, for example between Helsinki and Tampere. Since Finland is a large and sparsely populated country, there is no need to upgrade all highways to motorways.

=== Germany ===
&quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;Autobahn&quot; (motorway), &quot;B&quot; for &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; (literally &quot;federal road&quot;). There are also &quot;L&quot; roads (&quot;Landesstraße&quot; for Bundes&quot;land&quot;; in Saxony &quot;S&quot; and Bavaria &quot;St&quot; for &quot;Staatsstraße&quot;), &quot;K&quot; roads (&quot;Kreisstraße&quot; for districts, in some states of Germany &quot;K&quot; roads are classified as &quot;Landesstraßen 2. Ordnung&quot; and also carry an &quot;L&quot; number).

Formerly, &quot;B&quot; roads were also designated as &quot;F&quot; for &quot;Fernstraße&quot; (long-distance road) in East Germany until 1990 and as &quot;R&quot; for &quot;Reichsstraße&quot; (imperial road) in the Weimar republic and Nazi-Germany until the Second World War.

&quot;A&quot; roads use white numbers on blue shields, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;R&quot; roads black numbers on yellow shields and &quot;L&quot;, &quot;K&quot; and &quot;St&quot; roads – if designated – black numbers on white shields. The respective letters are normally not included in the shield.

==== Autobahns ====
In Germany, the normal route number for the German autobahns consists of the letter A and a number:
* 1-digit-numbers are the most important autobahns;
* 2- and 3-digit numbers are for connectors of 1-digit-number-autobahns; and
* north–south routes have odd numbers, and east–west routes have even numbers.

==== Bundesstraßen ====
Bundesstraßen are national highways, their numbers consist of the letter B and a number:
* 1-digit numbers are more important than 2- or 3-digit numbers;
* the first ten roads span the entire country, the 2-digit roads were assigned sequentially in clusters connecting the major regions, and the 3-digit roads are usually shorter connector roads.
* short branches of Bundesstraßen are sometimes signed with the letter &quot;a&quot; (e.g. B 27a); and
* rerouted Bundesstraßen may be given numbers with an appended &quot;n&quot; (e.g. B 7n).

West Berlin once had its own Bundesstraßen with letters.

====State roads====
State roads are roads operated by the German federal states. They are called Landesstrasse or Staatsstrasse (in Saxony and Bavaria). They are labeled by an initial L or S and a one- to four-digit individual number (e.g. S2 or L240). The federal states sustain their own numbering systems with individual styles of number shields used.

==== Gallery ====
===Hong Kong===
* Highways or Routes are numbered 1-10.
* Routes are also given names (e.g. Tolo Highway)

===Indonesia===
Indonesia is an archipelago. For national route numbering, every main island has its own number. For both national routes and toll roads, numbering starts at 1 on every main island and continues to the small surrounding islands.
* National Route Sign Number: on the top of route number has combination letter &quot;NASIONAL&quot; with background color red, followed by region code each province and number route written on the bottom. 
* Toll Road Sign Number: on the top of route number has combination letter &quot;TOL&quot; with background color red, followed by region code each province and number route written on the bottom. 
* Provincial Route Sign Number: on the top of route number has combination letter &quot;PROVINSI&quot; with background color blue, followed by region code each regency or city and number route written on the bottom.

The numbering is considered by these provision:
*The road sections that parallel to the coastline are given an odd number start from 1 (one) in every main island.
*The next numbering starts from left-right then top-down until the roads on the island have been mapped.
*The road sections that cross the island are numbered even, starting with the number 2 (two).
*Especially for Sulawesi Island, route numbering starts from the bottom of the island to the top of the island.

Until 2019, Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia) has set 31 national routes on Java Island, 55 national routes on Sumatra Island, and 6 national routea on Bali Island. For toll road numbering, the ministry also has set 11 number routes on Java Island, 5 number routes on Sumatra Island, and 1 number route on Bali Island.

=== Italy ===

&quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;autostrada&quot; (&quot;motorway&quot;), &quot;SS&quot; for &quot;strada statale&quot; (&quot;state highway&quot;), &quot;SR&quot; for &quot;strada regionale&quot; (&quot;regional road&quot;), &quot;SP&quot; for &quot;strada provinciale&quot; (&quot;provincial road&quot;) and &quot;SC&quot; for &quot;strada comunale&quot; (&quot;municipal road&quot;).

====Autostrade====

Autostrade of Italy follow a single numbering, even if managed by different concessionaire companies: they are all marked with the letter &quot;A&quot; (&quot;RA&quot; in the case of motorway junctions, with the exception of the Bereguardo-Pavia junction numbered on the signs as Autostrada A53, and &quot;T&quot; for the international Alpine tunnels) followed by a number. Therefore a motorway with the same numbering can be managed by different concessionaire companies (for example the Autostrada A23 is managed for a stretch by and for the remaining stretch by Autostrade per l&#x27;Italia). In road signs the alphanumeric acronym is enclosed (not in the case of the 16 junctions) in a green octagon with a white acronym. The numbers of motorways and tunnels are assigned with a circular from the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport to be published in the &quot;Gazzetta Ufficiale&quot;. 

====Strade statali====

Strade statali are identified by a number and a name. In road signs and maps the number is preceded by the acronym SS, an acronym for &quot;strada statale&quot; (&quot;state road&quot;). The nomenclature of the state highways managed by ANAS generally follows the SS &quot;n&quot; scheme, where &quot;n&quot; is a number ranging from 1 (Aurelia) up to 700 (of the Royal Palace of Caserta) depending on the date of establishment of the state highway. Newly built ANAS roads, not yet classified, are identified by the acronym NSA, an acronym for &quot;nuova strada ANAS&quot; (&quot;new ANAS road&quot;). In road signs the alphanumeric acronym is enclosed in a blue rectangle with a white acronym.

====Strade regionali, strade provinciali and strade comunali====

Strade regionali are identified by a number. In road signs and maps the number is preceded by the acronym SR, an acronym for &quot;strada regionale&quot; (&quot;regional road&quot;). In road signs the alphanumeric acronym is enclosed in a blue rectangle with a white acronym.

Strade provinciali are identified by a number. In road signs and maps the number is preceded by the acronym SP, an acronym for &quot;strada provinciale&quot; (&quot;provincial road&quot;). In road signs the alphanumeric acronym is enclosed in a blue rectangle with a white acronym.

Extra-urban strade comunali may be identified by a number. In road signs and maps the number is preceded by the acronym SC, an acronym for &quot;strada comunale&quot; (&quot;municipal road&quot;). In road signs the alphanumeric acronym is enclosed in a white rectangle with a black acronym. Very rarely extra-urban strade comunali are marked with a number and with the abbreviation SC.
===Malaysia===

Route numbering in Malaysia is fairly simple.

====West====
* All expressways (classified as an expressway by the Malaysian government) has a route number beginning with &#x27;E&#x27;, followed by a number. (e.g. North–South Expressway Northern Route and New Klang Valley Expressway)
* All federal roads can have any route number except those stated below. (e.g. Malaysia Federal Route 1)
* Industrial roads has a four-digit route number beginning with &#x27;3&#x27;.
* Roads build by the Federal Land Development Authority has a four-digit route number starting with &#x27;1&#x27; or &#x27;2&#x27;.
* Institutional facilities roads follow the normal numbering of federal roads.
* All state roads begins with a letter other than &#x27;E&#x27;, followed by a number.

====East====

=====Sabah=====
* All major roads in Sabah are federal roads. The route numbers are usually three-digits beginning with &#x27;5&#x27;.
* Route 1, 13 and 22 belong to the Pan Borneo Highway.
* Institutional roads route numbers have three-digits beginning with &#x27;6&#x27;.
* State roads normally begins with the letter &#x27;SA&#x27;, but some roads such as the Sapi-Nangoh Highway starts with the letter &#x27;R&#x27;. Papar Spur-Pengalat-Lok Kawi Road and Beluran Road begin with the letter &#x27;A&#x27; which is derived from the old route numbering scheme, though both of them are state roads.

=====Sarawak=====
* Federal roads in Sarawak are divided into sections. They have a main route number of &#x27;1&#x27;, referring to the whole stretch of the route (i.e. Pan Borneo Highway), followed by a dash (-) and the section number. (e.g. Jalan Kuching-Serian)
* Other roads can have any route number and are also divided into sections.
* All state roads begin with the letter &#x27;Q&#x27; followed by a number. Like federal roads, state roads may also be divided into sections.

=====Labuan=====
* All federal roads in Labuan have a three-digit number beginning with &#x27;7&#x27;.

=== Singapore ===
Unlike in neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore does not use a route numbering system. Instead, expressways in Singapore are assigned a three letter code, such as ECP for East Coast Parkway.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has two road numbering schemes, one for Great Britain and the other for Northern Ireland. Both schemes follow the same principles, but the numbers are independent and the same road number may be duplicated between the two schemes.

====A, B, unnumbered, and unclassified roads====

In the United Kingdom, road numbers consist of a number up to 4 digits, prefixed with the letters A or B. The main road from London to Edinburgh was designated the A1 in 1921; the &quot;A&quot; indicates a &quot;trunk&quot; or &quot;principal&quot; road, between regional towns and cities. In Great Britain, the A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 radiate out from London, or nearby, (in clockwise order) to points around the coast. Some A-roads, or sections of A-roads, are dual carriageway, without being full motorways; some sections upgraded to motorway standards are designated in the form A1(M). B roads are minor roads; they may connect small towns and villages, or offer an alternate route to major roads. Classified unnumbered roads, unofficially called C roads, are smaller roads typically connecting unclassified roads with A and B roads. Unclassified roads are roads intended for local traffic; 60% of UK roads are unclassified, and the 200,000 miles of B, unnumbered, and unclassified roads constitute 87% of total road length in the UK.

All classified roads in England and Wales starting in the zone between the A1 and the A2 begin with the figure 1 (e.g. A137, B1412), all classified roads in England and Wales starting in the zone between the A2 and the A3 begin with the figure 2 (e.g. A213, B2767), all classified roads in England and Wales starting in the zone between the A3 and the A4 begin with the figure 3 (e.g. A374, B3143), etc. Scotland is similarly divided into zones by the A7, A8 and A9 which radiate out from Edinburgh. Zones are not used in Northern Ireland.

====Motorways====

Motorways are classified as &quot;special roads&quot;, and are numbered in a similar, but not identical, manner. Motorways are either M-class or upgraded A-road, A(M) class. M-class motorways are labelled in the form M&quot;x&quot;, as a higher grade of motorway, and A(M) roads are labelled in the form A&quot;x&quot;(M), where &quot;x&quot; is the designation of the road, dependent on the zone. For example, the M25 is the London Orbital Motorway, and the A1(M) is the upgraded A1 dual carriageway.

A similar clock-face zonal system is used in many other European countries (for example, Spain and Belgium).

===United States===

In the United States, numbered highways belong to one of three or more systems of numbered routes, depending on the state. There are two national-level route numbering systems, the older United States Numbered Highway System laid out in 1920s, and the newer Interstate Highway System started in the 1950s. Additionally, every state in the U.S. maintains its own set of numbered state highways. Some states have other systems as well, either a system of numbered county highways or secondary state highways. A few cities also have numbered city highways; for example, the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, maintains Charlotte Route 4.

The U.S. Highway System, indicated by a white shield with black numbers, is based on a numbering grid, with odd routes running generally north–south and even routes running east–west. Primary routes have a one- or two-digit number, and are supplemented by spur routes that add a hundreds digit to their parent route. Routes increase from east-to-west and north-to-south, such that U.S. Route 1 follows the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, while U.S. Route 101 does the same at the Pacific Ocean Coast. Likewise U.S. Route 2 runs near the Canadian border, while U.S. Route 98 follows the Gulf Coast. Major cross-country routes end in either a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;. For example, U.S. Route 20 is a route that runs over from Boston, Massachusetts, to Newport, Oregon, while U.S. Route 41 spans the country from Miami, Florida, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Routes like U.S. Route 141 and U.S. Route 441 branch off U.S. Route 41. U.S. Route 66, known as the &quot;Mother Road&quot;, was a cultural touchstone that inspired literature, songs, and other media from its creation in 1926 until it was superseded by segments of the Interstate Highway System. Parts of the road have been designated &quot;Historic Route 66&quot;.

The Interstate Highway System, indicated by a red and blue shield with white numbers, is a system of entirely freeways (unlike the U.S. Highway System, which is mostly undivided surface roads). The Interstate System is also based on a grid, with east–west routes bearing even numbers and north–south routes bearing odd numbers. In order to prevent confusion with the earlier U.S. Highway System, however, the Interstates are numbered in the opposite direction, such that the lowest routes numbers are in the south and west, and the highest numbers in the north and east. Major routes end in either a &quot;0&quot; or a &quot;5&quot;; for example Interstate 10 spans the country from Jacksonville, Florida, to Santa Monica, California, while Interstate 35 goes from the Mexican border to the Great Lakes. Like with U.S. Highways, subsidiary routes are numbered by adding a hundreds digit to the parent route. Because of the large number of these routes, three-digit numbers may be repeated within the system, but unique to each state. Additionally, the parity of the hundreds digit tells the nature of the spur route: odd hundreds digits like Interstate 393 only connect to the system at one end (forming &quot;spurs&quot;), while an even hundreds digit like Interstate 440 indicates that the highway connects to another Interstate at both ends (forming loops).

The numbering system for state highways varies widely from state to state. Each state decides how to number its own routes. Some maintain systems similar to the national road systems, based on a grid. Others number highways regionally, with similar numbers occurring in the same area of the state. Still others have no discernible system, with no connection between a route&#x27;s location and its number.

In addition to numbers, route numbers also use suffixed letters and banners appended to the tops of signs to indicate alternate routes to the main highway. For example, U.S. Route 1A is the name given to many highways which are either older alignments of U.S. Route 1 or provide an alternate route either around or through a city along U.S. Route 1&#x27;s route. Banners are sometimes used to indicate alternate routes. Words like &quot;Alternate&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, or &quot;Bypass&quot; can be added to a sign to indicate such a situation.

===Elsewhere===
Some countries, such as Brazil, number their national highways by direction. (BR1xx = North/South highways, BR2xx = East/West, BR3xx = &#x27;Diagonal&#x27; (i.e. NW/SE or NE/SW)).

====Cyprus A, B, E, F system====
A stands for motorway and B is for main roads. E and F are for smaller local roads.

====Estonian T system====
T is the prefix for all roads, however not represented on route shields.
The prefix is mostly only used by the Estonian Road Administration and is not in common usage when referring to roads.

====French A, N, D system====
A stands for &quot;autoroute&quot; (motorway), N for &quot;national road&quot;, D for &quot;départementale&quot; road and C for &quot;communale&quot;. France still uses Route Nationale numbers from an 1824 revision of 1811 numbers made under Napoleon.

====Irish M, N, R, L system ====

M stands for Motorway, N for National primary road or National secondary road, R for Regional road and L for Local road.

====Jamaica A, B system====
====Japanese C, E system====
C stands for circular, E stands for expressway. These designations are used on most expressways in Japan outside of the urban systems. The designations, depicted with a green rectangle with white numbers and letters, are used on guide signs as well as highway shields.

====Netherlands&#x27; A, N system====
A stands for &quot;Autosnelweg&quot; (motorway), N for Non motorways. The A-codes use white letters on a red shield, the N-codes black letters on a yellow shield. Where a highway changes into a motorway or vice versa, it may continue to use the same number, but the letter and the color are switched.
When the letter is followed by three digits, the road is typically a provincial road. When there are only one or two digits, it is typically a national road.

==== Philippines E, N system ====


The Philippines&#x27; new route numbering system, started in 2014, for its network of expressways (limited access roads) and national roads (of the primary and secondary types), uses E and N, respectively. National roads (&quot;N&quot; roads, of the primary and secondary designation) use white shields based on the Australian National Route shields, but signed with the number only, with N included for inventory purposes. Expressways (&quot;E&quot; roads) uses signs the same design as with national primary and secondary roads, but colored yellow, and unlike national roads, includes E to prevent confusion.

====Polish A, S, DK, DW system====
* A stands for &quot;autostrada&quot; (motorway)
* S stands for &quot;droga ekspresowa&quot; (expressway)
* DK stands for &quot;droga krajowa&quot; (national road)
* DW stands for &quot;droga wojewódzka&quot; (voivodeship/provincial road)

There are also county roads (DP, &quot;droga powiatowa&quot;) and communal/municipal roads (DG, &quot;droga gminna&quot;). However the numbers of these types of routes are only for administrative purposes, therefore not displayed on signage.

====Senegal N, R system====

N stands for &quot;national&quot; roads while R is for &quot;regional&quot; roads.

====South African N, R, M system====

N stands for national road, R stands for regional road and M stands for metropolitan road.

====Spain A, AP, N system====

* A, followed by one or two digits, stands for &quot;autovía&quot; (dual carriageway).
** If followed by three or four digits, it is road owned by a regional government, usually Andalusia or Aragon, and may or may not be a divided highway.
* AP stands for &quot;autopista de peaje&quot; (toll motorway)
* N stands for &quot;nacional&quot; (national), single carriageway road owned by the national Government. National roads 1 to 6 are radial roads linking Madrid with major cities or borders with France and Portugal. All other roads are numbered with three digits.

Other letters refer to the code of the region or city that is served by the road. See for example M-30, with M standing for Madrid.

====Turkey O, D, I system====

* O stands for &quot;Otoyol&quot; (motorway)
* D stands for &quot;Devlet Yolu&quot; (expressways/major highways)
* I stands for &quot;Il Yolu&quot; (provincial roads/minor highways)

====Vietnamese QL, TL, HL system====
The following abbreviations appear on guide signs and kilometer posts:

; CT : (expressway)
; QL : (national road)
; TL or ĐT : or (provincial road)
; HL : or (rural district road)
; ĐCK : (canal towpath)
