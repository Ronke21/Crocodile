<text>David Clark (born 15 December 1939) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer and entrepreneur. Clark was the leader, drummer and manager of the 1960s beat group the Dave Clark Five, the first British Invasion band to follow the Beatles to the United States in 1964. In 2008, Clark and his band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Clark was born in Tottenham, then lived in Middlesex. He left school without qualifications at the age of 15 and claims to have become a film stuntman, performing in over 40 films (although IMDB only gives him four pre-fame film credits). In the late 1950s he bought a set of drums, taught himself how to play them, and formed a skiffle band to raise funds so that his football team could travel to the Netherlands. The skiffle band grew into the Dave Clark Five, with Clark their leader, co-songwriter, manager and producer.

=== The Dave Clark Five ===

The Dave Clark Five grew in popularity in the UK. They unseated the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; from its number one spot in the UK singles charts in January 1964 with &quot;Glad All Over&quot;. The British press, briefly, called them the Beatles&#x27; &quot;most serious threat&quot;. The Dave Clark Five were the first British Invasion band to follow the Beatles to the United States in 1964, where they achieved 14 top 20 hits, eight of which were consecutive. They also appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; more times than any other English group. Dave Clark became a popular name for babies in the 1960s.

Andrew Loog Oldham, former manager of the Rolling Stones, said of the band&#x27;s early success as rivals to the Beatles: &quot;If the Beatles ever looked over their shoulders, it was not the Stones they saw. They saw the Dave Clark 5 or Herman&#x27;s Hermits.&quot;

The band broke up in 1970, and Clark stopped drumming in 1972 after he broke four knuckles in a tobogganing accident.

=== Later works ===
Clark later wrote a science fiction stage musical, &quot;Time&quot;, which debuted in 1986. It played for two years in London&#x27;s West End, starring Cliff Richard (replaced later by David Cassidy). The musical also launched a concept album, likewise titled &quot;Time&quot;, which featured Richard, Freddie Mercury, Leo Sayer, Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick. Two million copies were sold and it spun off several hit singles.

Clark is an entrepreneur and a multi-millionaire. He owns a £12 million house in West London. From the outset, Clark owned the rights to all the Dave Clark Five music masters. It is claimed that other songwriters in the band were required to give copyright ownership of their tunes to Clark, even if he did not co-write them. In the late 1960s, in addition to managing his band, Clark began directing and producing for television. In 1968 he made a television production, &quot;Hold On, It&#x27;s the Dave Clark Five&quot;. In the 1980s he acquired the rights to the 1960s UK music show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;.

On the release of a Dave Clark Five British hits album in the mid-1970s, Clark resided in the US for a year, thus avoiding paying UK taxes in Britain on the proceeds of that release. The British government challenged this but lost the case in court.

In 1993, Clark released remastered versions of all the Dave Clark Five singles on a CD, &quot;Glad All Over Again&quot;.

Companies House lists him as director of several companies.

== Personal life ==
Clark was a close friend of Freddie Mercury, whom he had known since 1976. He was by Mercury&#x27;s bedside when the Queen singer died on 24 November 1991.

==Honours and legacy==
In 2008, marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the band, the Dave Clark Five were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Clark, making a rare public appearance, and the two other surviving band members at the time accepted the award on behalf of the group.

In 2014, Clark wrote, produced, appeared in, and partly presented, the 115-minute documentary &quot;The Dave Clark Five and Beyond: Glad All Over&quot;.

<doc id="1089607" wikidata="Q1923361" url="?curid=1089607" title="Adrian helmet">
<text>The Adrian helmet () was an influential design of combat helmet originally produced for the French Army during World War I. Its original version, the M15, was the first standard helmet of the French Army and was designed when millions of French troops were engaged in trench warfare, and head wounds from the falling shrapnel generated by indirect fire became a frequent cause of battlefield casualties. Introduced in 1915, it was the first modern steel helmet and it served as the basic helmet of many armies well into the 1930s. Initially issued to infantry soldiers, in modified form they were also issued to cavalry and tank crews. A subsequent version, the M26, was used during World War II.

==History==

===World War I===
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, soldiers in the French Army wore the standard kepi cap, which provided no protection against injury. The early stages of trench warfare proved that even basic protection of the head would result in a significantly lower mortality rate among front-line soldiers. By the beginning of 1915, a rudimentary steel skull-cap (&quot;calotte métallique&quot;, &quot;cervelière&quot;) was being issued to be worn under the kepi.

Consequently, the French staff ordered development of a metal helmet that could protect soldiers from the shrapnel of exploding artillery shells. Since soldiers in trenches were also vulnerable to shrapnel exploding above their heads, a deflector crest was added along the helmet&#x27;s axis. Branch insignia in the form of a grenade for line infantry and cavalry, a bugle horn for chasseurs, crossed cannon for artillery, an anchor for colonial troops and a crescent for North African units was attached to the front. Contrary to common misconception, the M15 helmet, and other Great War helmets, were not designed to protect the wearer from direct impact by rifle or machine gun bullets. The resulting headgear was credited to Intendant-General Louis Auguste Adrian.

The helmet adopted by the army was made of mild steel and weighed only , which made it lighter and less protective than the contemporary British Brodie helmet and the German &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. Orders were placed for the helmets in the spring of 1915, which started being issued by July. By September, all frontline troops in France were issued the helmet. The helmet was surprisingly complex to produce, with seventy stages involved in its production, not including those required to prepare the metal. The slot for the badges and the distinctive crest took additional time to manufacture, while also adding a hundred grams of weight. 

However, the helmet was deliberately designed this way to evoke the artistic style of the highly popular military artist Édouard Detaille, which helped raise the morale of the troops. Indeed French troops identified closely with their helmets. The helmet&#x27;s light weight was also better suited to France&#x27;s emphasis on mobility and was easier for soldiers to wear for extended periods. In addition to the helmet, a set of armored &quot;epaulets&quot; were also developed by Adrian and issued to defend against shrapnel and air-dropped darts, although they were not in common use.

From late 1915, a cloth cover for the helmet was issued, in khaki or light blue, to prevent reflection. However, it was found that if the helmet was pierced by shell splinters, pieces of dirty cloth were carried into the wound, which increased the risk of infection. Consequently, in mid-1916 an order was issued that the covers should be discarded. By the end of World War I, the Adrian had been issued to almost all infantry units fighting with the French Army. It was also used by some of the American divisions fighting in France, including the African-American 369th Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the Harlem Hellfighters, and the Polish forces of Haller&#x27;s Blue Army. The French &quot;Gendarmerie mobile&quot; adopted a dark blue version in 1926, and continued to wear it into the 1960s, well after the regular army had discarded it. 

In December 1915, Winston Churchill (later to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945), while serving as a major with the British Army&#x27;s Grenadier Guards, was presented with an Adrian helmet by the French General Émile Fayolle. He is seen wearing it in photographs and in a portrait painted by Sir John Lavery.

The helmet proved to be fairly effective against shrapnel and it was cheap and easy to manufacture. As a consequence, more than twenty million Adrian helmets were produced. They were widely adopted by other countries, including Albania, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Haiti, Italy (including license-built versions), Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Siam, Turkey, the United States, USSR, and Yugoslavia, many of these states adding their own insignia to the front of the helmet.

However, because the new steel helmets offered little protection against bullets, they were reportedly often among the first pieces of equipment to be abandoned by soldiers on the battlefield. It was also discovered that the badge placed on the front of helmets impaired the strength of the helmet because of the two slots required. This perceived weakness made several armies remove their national insignia altogether. Early helmets were painted &quot;horizon-blue&quot; (light blue-grey) for French troops and khaki for colonial forces. Those made after 1935 are usually painted khaki, reflecting the French army movement to a more camouflaged uniform in the 1930s.

===Later service===
In 1926, the Adrian helmet was modified by being constructed of stronger steel and simplified by having the main part of the helmet stamped from one piece of metal, and therefore without the joining rim around the helmet that characterizes the M15. The large ventilation hole under the comb, which had been a weak point of the old design, was also replaced with a series of small holes. The M26 helmet continued in use with the French Army until after World War II, and was also used by the French police up to the 1970s. During the interwar period Belgium began to produce their own domestically made M26 Adrians and exported them around the globe. These helmets can be distinguished from their French counterparts, because they have a slightly different comb and a wider rim. In other countries the Adrian-type helmets were also in use with the fire-fighting units, railway guards or marine infantry (e.g. Japan&#x27;s SNLF). Adrian helmets are still prized by collectors today. In 1940, Mexico began to produce M26 helmets locally after shipments from France stopped due to the German occupation. A crestless version was produced in small numbers as well.

==Modern assessment==

A 2020 study published by &quot;PLOS One&quot; found that the Adrian helmet outperformed the Advanced Combat Helmet, which was deployed almost a century later, in overhead blasts. It also surpassed the Stahlhelm and Brodie helmets. The researchers believed the crest, a feature unique to the Adrian helmet, might be the cause.

<doc id="1089609" wikidata="Q898746" url="?curid=1089609" title="Brann Stadion">
<text>Brann Stadion is a football stadium in Bergen, Norway. It was constructed in 1919, and has been the home of the football club Brann ever since. The stadium lies south of the city centre, at the foot of Mount Ulriken.

The record attendance dates from 1 October 1961, when Brann hosted Fredrikstad in the cup semi-final, in front of 24,800 spectators. Though its league attendance record is 23,900, from 1978, when they hosted Lillestrøm. Brann Stadion has, per. 2009, a capacity of 17,317. A redevelopment project was underway, aimed at increasing the capacity to over 20,000, but it has been put on hold. Brann Stadion has the third largest attendance capacity in Norway.

== History ==
The history of Brann Stadion begins with Christen K. Gran, a member of the sports committee and one of the founders of Brann. It was his idea, in 1917, that Brann build a new stadium to call their own at &quot;Fridalen&quot; in the borough of Årstad. His proposal was initially met with scepticism, but he was determined to realize this project for the club and set about obtaining the necessary funds. According to tradition, donations ahead of the 1917 Norwegian Cup final between Brann and Sarpsborg secured the last sums of money needed to purchase the land. Construction began the year after and on 25 May 1919, the stadium was inaugurated with a match between Brann and the Norwegian national team.

At first, the stadium had running tracks, and terraces on each side of the pitch, while the west end and the Clock End remained undeveloped. The club house stood at the halfway line on the south side. During the 1930s, the club house was relocated and the current Main Stand built. Originally, it did not run the full length of the pitch. Over the years it has been expanded at both ends, with each expansion being of a different design from the rest. As a result, today&#x27;s stand has a rather disjointed look about it. The middle part houses an honorary box above the tunnel, called &quot;Brannaltanen&quot; (The Brann Balcony).

The north side was redeveloped in 1978, adding a roofed tier behind the original terraces. The bottom part of the stand had a capacity of 3,000 standing spectators, nicknamed &quot;Store Stå&quot; (The Grand Stand). The crowds there, among the most passionate supporters of the club, used to create an excellent atmosphere. The upper tier seated 2,620. Umbro bought the naming rights to the stand in 2002 when they became the club&#x27;s kit supplier. In November 2006, the northern stand was demolished to give way for a new all-seated stand with heavily improved VIP facilities.

Since the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the ensuing Taylor Report, football clubs in Europe have been converting their stadiums to all-seaters, and although Norwegian clubs have not felt the same pressure as, for example, English clubs, they have been hampered by the fact that continental competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Cup demand that their games be all-seaters. Whenever Brann have entered European competitions, home games have had to be played with a reduced capacity. Eventually, the Football Association of Norway also began to impose restrictions on non-seated attendance in the domestic league.

At the end of the 1990s major plans were drawn up for the modernization of the stadium (plans which ultimately left the club heavily indebted). In 1997, the final expansion of the Main Stand was completed, putting its capacity at 4,339. The Frydenbø Stand seating 3,892 was built at the west end the following year. The Eastern stand formerly known as the Clock End has been redeveloped into an all-seated stand, which has been given the name The BT stand. At present, a new stand at the northern end is being developed.

In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players&#x27; Association among away-team captains, Brann Stadion was ranked eighth amongst league stadiums, with a score of 3.47 on a scale from one to five.

== Expansion ==

In 2001, it became clear that Brann would have to improve their stadium, or build a new one. Brann Stadion was still able to hold approximately 20,000 spectators, but increasingly strict rules regarding non-seated attendance meant the terrace capacity was gradually being reduced each year. Apart from the Frydenbø Stand, the stadium was more or less outdated, and many were now advocating the building of a completely new arena, at a different location from the old stadium. With a decision yet to be made, Brann were forced to install temporary bleachers at the Clock End in 2004 to accommodate a higher number of seated spectators. In addition, 160 seats were added to the Frydenbø Stand, increasing the number of seats to 12,211. The total capacity was limited to 17,500.
Controversy arose when entire rows of seating in the BT Stand collapsed during the game against Tromsø. Each row of seats is fixed to an aluminium rail which in turn is mounted to the concrete floor. Some of the mounts proved too weak to withstand the weight of the crowds, breaking off as people began to take their seats. The 90,000 seats that have been installed in the new Wembley Stadium are of the same design.

The Umbro Stand was torn down at the end of the 2006-season, and has been replaced by a new main stand seating 4,136. This stand features improved VIP facilities, including 35 executive boxes (eight in the corner between the main stand and the Clock End).

== International matches ==

Brann Stadion has hosted 17 international games since 1933. The very first match ended in a 1–2 defeat at the hands of Wales, but since then Norway have not lost any subsequent game in Bergen (P17 W12 D4 L1). The stadium was the venue for three Norwegian Cup finals, in 1922, 1930 and 1947, as well as the national athletics championships in 1920.

<doc id="1089621" wikidata="Q26967" url="?curid=1089621" title="Telogen effluvium">
<text>Telogen effluvium is a scalp disorder characterized by the thinning or shedding of hair resulting from the early entry of hair in the telogen phase (the resting phase of the hair follicle). It is in this phase that telogen hairs begin to shed at an increased rate, where normally the approximate rate of hair loss (having no effect on one&#x27;s appearance) is 125 hairs per day.

There are 5 potential alterations in the hair cycle that could lead to this shedding: immediate anagen release, delayed anagen release, short anagen syndrome, immediate telogen release, and delayed telogen release.

* Immediate anagen release occurs when follicles leave anagen and are stimulated to enter telogen prematurely. The effects become visible 2–3 months later with increased telogen effluvium.
* Delayed anagen release, most commonly associated with pregnancy, involves the prolongation of anagen under the effect of pregnancy hormones, resulting in delayed but synchronous and heavy postpartum hair shedding.
* Short anagen syndrome is characterized by an idiopathic and persistent telogen hair shedding, as well as the inability to grow hair long. This is a result of the shortening of the duration of anagen, meaning a greater number of telogen hairs at any given time, and is responsible for the majority of chronic TE cases. 
* Immediate telogen release generally occurs with drug-induced shortening of telogen leading to the premature reentrance of follicles to anagen, which causes a massive release of club (telogen) hairs. Drugs such as minoxidil can precipitate immediate telogen release.
* Delayed telogen release involves a prolonged telogen phase followed by a delayed transition to anagen. This occurs in animals with synchronous hair cycles that shed their hair or winter coats seasonally. This is also sometimes responsible for seasonal hair loss in humans.

Emotional or physiological stress may result in an alteration of the normal hair cycle and cause the disorder, with potential causes including eating disorders, crash diets, pregnancy and childbirth, chronic illness, major surgery, anemia, severe emotional disorders, hypothyroidism, and drugs.

Diagnostic tests, which may be performed to verify the diagnosis, include a trichogram, trichoscopy and biopsy. Effluvium can present with similar appearance to alopecia totalis, with further distinction by clinical course, microscopic examination of plucked follicles, or biopsy of the scalp. Histology would show telogen hair follicles in the dermis with minimal inflammation in effluvium, and dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate in alopecia totalis.

Vitamin D levels may also play a role in the normal hair cycle.

Many new cosmetic treatments have been reported, including Stemoxydine, Nioxin, minoxidil, and a leave-on technology combination: caffeine, niacinamide, panthenol, dimethicone, and an acrylate polymer (CNPDA). This treatment has shown to increase the diameter of existing, individual scalp hair fibres by 2–5 μm, yielding a significant increase of approximately 10% in the cross-sectional area of each hair. Additionally, CNPDA-thickened hairs also demonstrate altered mechanical properties of thicker fibres; increased suppleness/pliability, and increased ability to withstand force without breaking.

<text>Calcio storico fiorentino, also known as calcio storico, calcio in livrea or calcio in costume, is an early form of football that originated during the Middle Ages in Italy. Once widely played, the sport is thought to have started in the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. There it became known as the &quot;giuoco del calcio fiorentino&quot; or simply &quot;calcio&quot;, which is now also the name for association football in the Italian language. The game may have started as a revival of the Roman sport of &quot;harpastum&quot;.

It is organized during the celebrations of St. John the Baptist, with the finals held on 24 June.

==History==

===Renaissance era===

According to the legend, playing violent games was a way to train young soldiers, and &quot;calcio&quot; was born out of this rugby-like military training when the aristocrats turned it into a fully-fledged sport.

&quot;Calcio&quot; was reserved for rich aristocrats who played every night between Epiphany and Lent. Even popes, such as Clement VII, Leo XI and Urban VIII, played the sport in Vatican City. The games could get violent as teams vied to score goals. A variation of &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot; was most likely played in the 15th century as well, as a match was organized on the River Arno in 1490, notable as a day so cold the waters were completely frozen.

On another famous occasion, the city of Florence held a match on February 17, 1530, in defiance of the imperial troops sent by Charles V, as the city was under siege. The &quot;noble game&quot; was played in Piazza Santa Croce, only by distinguished soldiers, lords, noblemen and princes.

A version of rules for the game were first recorded by Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi in the late 16th century.

===Modern revival===

Interest in &quot;calcio&quot; waned in the early 17th century. However, in 1930 it was reorganized as a game in the Kingdom of Italy, under Benito Mussolini. It was widely played by amateurs in streets and squares using handmade balls of cloth or animal skin. Today, three matches are played each year in Piazza Santa Croce, in Florence, in the third week of June. A team from each &quot;quartiere&quot; of the city is represented:

* Santa Croce / Azzurri (Blues)
* Santa Maria Novella / Rossi (Reds)
* Santo Spirito / Bianchi (Whites)
* San Giovanni / Verdi (Greens)
After playing each other in two opening games, the two overall winners go into the yearly final on 24 June, the feast of San Giovanni (St. John), the Patron Saint of Florence. For decades, this violent match has resulted in severe injuries, including death. During the early decades, in order to encourage wagering and achieve a bettable winner, there were times when bulls would be ushered into the ring in hopes of adding confusion and inciting victory. The modern version of &quot;calcio&quot; has not changed much from its historical roots, which allow tactics such as head-butting, punching, elbowing, and choking. However, due to often fatal injuries, sucker punches and kicks to the head are currently banned. It is also prohibited for more than one player to attack an opponent. Any violation leads to being expelled from the game.

The most successful team since 1979 is Santa Croce / Azzurri (Blues) with over 20 tournament wins. Tournaments have been cancelled on several occasions due to violence or foul play. These incidents have led to major rule changes, such as ensuring players are born in Florence (or have been resident for at least ten years) and excluding players that have criminal convictions. 

==Rules==


Matches last 50 minutes and are played on a field covered in sand, twice as long as it is wide (approximately ). A white line divides the field into two identical squares, and a goal net runs the width of each end.

Each team has 27 players and no substitutions are allowed for injured or expelled players. The teams are made up of four &quot;datori indietro&quot; (goalkeepers), three &quot;datori innanzi&quot; (fullbacks), five &quot;sconciatori&quot; (halfbacks) and 15 &quot;innanzi&quot; or &quot;corridori&quot; (forwards). The captain and standard bearer&#x27;s tent sits at the center of the goal net. They do not actively participate in the game, but can organize their teams and occasionally act as &quot;caccas&quot; (referees), mainly to calm down their players or to stop fights.

The referee and the six linesmen officiate the match in collaboration with the judge commissioner, who remains off the field. The referee, above everyone else, is the master of the field, and is responsible for making sure the game runs smoothly, stepping into the field only to maintain discipline and reestablish order when fights occur.
Shots from a small cannon or culverin announces the beginning of the event. The game starts when the &quot;pallaio&quot; throws and kicks the ball toward the center line, then at the first whistle as the ball first rests on field, 15 forwards or &quot;corridori&quot;, begin fighting in a wild mixed martial arts match- punching, kicking, tripping, hacking, tackling, and wrestling with each other in an effort designed to tire opponents&#x27; defenses, but which often descends into an all-out brawl. They try to pin and force into submission as many players possible. Once there are enough incapacitated players, the other teammates come and swoop up the ball and head to the goal.

From this moment on, the players try by any means necessary to get the ball into the opponents&#x27; goal, also called &quot;caccia&quot;. The teams change sides with every &quot;caccia&quot; or goal scored. It is important to shoot with precision, because every time a player throws or kicks the ball above the net, the opposing team is awarded with a half &quot;caccia&quot;. The game ends after 50 minutes and the team which scored the most &quot;cacce&quot; wins.

Along with the &quot;palio&quot;, the winning team used to receive a Chianina, a type of pure-bred cow. However, this has been reduced to a free dinner for the winning team; the players earn no other compensation.

==In popular culture==
Italian Baroque poet Gabriello Chiabrera wrote three odes about Florentine football, emphasising the game&#x27;s spectacular aspects and comparing it with Roman gladiatorial games. The comic book series &quot;Bitch Planet&quot; includes an event titled &quot;Duemila&quot; or &quot;Megaton&quot;; in issue #4 the event is described: &quot;Megaton is one of many modern descendants of &quot;calcio fiorentino&quot;, a 16th century Italian sport... Teams may have any number of players, but their combined weight can be no more than !&quot;.

In the 2017 film &quot;Lost In Florence&quot;, Brett Dalton plays a former college football star who travels to Italy and becomes involved in playing &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot;.

In episode 4, &quot;Judgement Day&quot; of the TV series, &quot;Medici: Masters of Florence&quot;, the main characters engage in a game of &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot; in the main square of Florence during a flashback sequence.

In the sixth episode from the second season of Syfy Channel&#x27;s HAPPY! (titled &quot;Pervapalooza&quot;), the demon Orcus references &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot; while trapped inside Blue Scaramucci&#x27;s body. The demon says that hockey seems like foxy boxing compared to &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot;.

&quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel about Thomas Cromwell, contains a description of an early 16th-century game of &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot;, emphasising its brutality.

Episode 1 of the 2020 Netflix series &quot;Home Game&quot; is dedicated to &quot;calcio storico fiorentino&quot;, featuring behind-the-scenes player vignettes contemporary to the 2019 Reds-versus-Whites final match. In addition to providing historical information, the episode depicts interviews with players from both teams.

<doc id="1089623" wikidata="Q370284" url="?curid=1089623" title="Nelson Dingley Jr.">
<text>Nelson Dingley Jr. (February 15, 1832 – January 13, 1899) was a journalist and politician from the U.S. state of Maine.

Dingley was born in Durham, Maine and attended the common schools at Unity, Maine and Waterville College (now Colby College). He graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1855, where he was a founding member of the Psi Epsilon chapter of Zeta Psi fraternity. He then studied law, received an LL.D. from Bates College, and was admitted to the bar in 1856. However, he never practiced law and instead became proprietor and editor of the Lewiston, Maine &quot;Journal&quot;, holding this post for more than twenty years. He was a member of the Maine House of Representatives 1862–1865, 1868, and again in 1873, serving as speaker in 1863 and 1864. He was the 34th governor of Maine in 1874 and a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1876 and 1880.

Dingley was elected as a Republican to the 47th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William P. Frye. He was then reelected to the 48th and to the seven succeeding Congresses, serving from September 12, 1881, until his death in Washington, D.C., before the close of the 55th Congress. Reputedly &quot;destitute of humor but soundly versed in finance&quot;, Dingley was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means in the 54th and 55th Congresses. The tariff schedule of 1897, known as the Dingley Tariff, was framed under his direction to repeal and reverse the lower rates set forth in the 1894 Democratic Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act. The Dingley Tariff raised tariff rates and granted the President authority to invoke reciprocity when negotiating trade treaties.

Dingley had been reelected to the 56th Congress and was succeeded by Charles E. Littlefield upon his death in Washington, D.C., on January 13, 1899. He is interred in Oak Hill Cemetery, near Auburn, Maine.

<doc id="1089625" wikidata="Q579914" url="?curid=1089625" title="Caique">
<text>Caique ( or ) refers to two to four species of parrots in the genus Pionites endemic to the Amazon Basin in South America.

==Name==
The term &quot;caique&quot; is primarily used in aviculture, with ornithologists typically referring to them as the black-headed parrot and white-bellied parrot, the latter of which is sometimes further split into three separate species, green-thighed parrot, yellow-tailed parrot and black-legged parrot. They have historically been called the &quot;seven-colored parrot&quot;. They are relatively small and stocky, with a short, square tail and bright colors; this may be why they are referred to as &quot;caique&quot; based on the term for a similarly described Turkish vessel. They exhibit high social intelligence.

==Description==
The two species are best distinguished by the black-headed parrot&#x27;s black crown; both have white &quot;bellies&quot;. Their typical weight is 150–170 grams, with the white-bellied species being the larger and heavier of the two species. They can live up to 40 years, but this is not common in captivity.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-headed caique is found north of the Amazon River, and the white-bellied caique south; there is a large area of overlap between ranges. They can produce fertile hybrids, but this is not common in the wild as it is in captivity. They generally prefer forested areas and subsist on fruit and seeds. Caiques are generally canopy dwellers, spending most of their time in the tops of trees, foraging and playing.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Pionites&quot; is classified as two species, the black-headed parrot and white-bellied parrot. Some recent morphological work has suggested that the white-bellied parrot should be split into three species based on plumage and leg coloration, though this has not been accepted by either the IOC World Bird List, or the South American Classification Committee. In the past these parrots were often allied with the conures or other South American parakeets. Recent mitochondrial and nuclear DNA work has found &quot;Pionites&quot; to be the sister taxon to the &quot;Deroptyus&quot; (the genus that contains the red-fan parrot); the two genera occupy a basal position in the tribe Arini.

==Natural history==
===Behavior and ecology===
These parrots are found in the edges of forests and secondary-growth forests. They usually forage on at higher levels in the canopy, although can also be found lower at forest edges. At least two members of the flock act as sentries during feeding time. Their diet consists of flowers, fruit, pulp, and seeds, although in captivity they are known to eat insects. Depending on the species and the location, they can breed from October to May at various times of the year. Caiques are high-nesting cavity birds and roost communally. They exhibit pack-like behavior when defending against threats. This may help to explain their relative self-confidence, compared to other parrots. Caiques are also known to form ad-hoc defensive committees in response to predators. The number of the flock is usually around 10 to 30 individuals. White-bellied caiques in the Tambopata National Reserve have been observed to be geophagous.

The species of the white-bellied parrot complex is found in humid forest and wooded habitats in the Amazon south of the Amazon River in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. It is generally fairly common throughout its range and is easily seen in a wide range of protected areas, such as the Manú National Park and Tambopata-Candamo in Peru, Cristalino State Park (near Alta Floresta), Xingu National Park and Amazônia National Park in Brazil, and Madidi National Park in Bolivia.

The black-headed parrot is found in forest (especially, but not exclusively, humid) and nearby wooded habitats in the Amazon north of the Amazon River and west of the Ucayali River in Brazil, northern Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It is generally fairly common and occurs in many protected areas throughout its range.

Caiques have a few unique ways of moving. They “surf” (described below), “hop” (when excited or to move quickly without flying), and “shuffle” (often in a rapid, backwards direction). They flip their wings rapidly, which exposes their red/orange patch under the wing, to potentially communicate to one another or other animals. They make different types of “purring” noises; some express wariness, others interest. They purr quietly when enjoying a drink. A startle call causes all caiques in the vicinity to take flight in random directions regardless of the initiator. A sound resembling a dead battery on a smoke detector is the typical contact call for the Black-headed Parrot.

When highly stimulated, caiques pin and flash their pupils, making their emotional state obvious. They are likely to attack and bite when displaying pinning and/or flashing eyes. Caiques are highly vocal and can inflict severely damaging bites. Caiques&#x27; wing feathers produce a distinctive whirring sound in flight.

===Aviculture===

Caiques are growing in popularity in aviculture. The more commonly found species is the black-headed caique since it was introduced first in captivity, but the white-bellied caique&#x27;s popularity is growing rapidly. Well-raised caiques bond well with humans and have a reputation as playful and energetic birds that enjoy playing with toys and lying on their backs. These birds sometimes perform a behavior unusual for avian species in which they roll over on their backs in apparent play-fighting with other caiques—sometimes called &quot;wrestling&quot;. They are not particularly good flyers, becoming tired and winded after only a short distance. They also tend to be clumsy and slow in the air compared to other birds. They often prefer to walk, jump, climb, ride other animals&#x27; backs, or hop as a mode of transportation. They are excellent climbers, with very strong feet and legs.

Caiques also exhibit a unique behavior known as &quot;surfing&quot;, where the bird will vigorously rub its face, wings and chest against any nearby soft item (e.g. carpets, towels, cushions, crumpled paper, curtains or human hair) while using its beak to pull itself along. The bird will display jerky movements and may roll over several times. This behavior is thought to be a cleaning or bathing motion and occurs regardless of age or sex. In the wild, caiques use wet leaves for this behavior.

In captivity caiques are capable of breeding at under three years of age. They typically lay a clutch of four eggs, with incubation taking between 24 and 27 days. Most pairs will struggle to raise all four chicks; often the last chick to hatch will not survive unless it is taken for hand-rearing or co-parenting. Chicks are fed by both parents and remain in the nest box for approximately 70–75 days. Parents can be very affectionate towards their offspring and after the chicks have fledged they will return to the nest box each night with their parents where the family will roost as a group.

==Conservation==
The nominal species of black-headed caique and white-bellied caique are listed on Appendix 2 of CITES as a species of Least Concern but subspecies are more endangered; in reality, data is insufficient as with many parrots.

<doc id="1089629" wikidata="Q6212880" url="?curid=1089629" title="Joe Walton">
<text>Joseph Frank Walton (December 15, 1935 – August 15, 2021) was an American professional football player and coach who retired after 20 years as the head coach and creator of the football program at Robert Morris University. Walton played eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a pass catching tight end for the Redskins and Giants. He served as head coach of the New York Jets for seven seasons, guiding them to the playoffs twice. He also served as an assistant coach for the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins, the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers during a 20-year period.

==Early life and playing career==
Walton was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1935, the son of former Washington Redskins guard Frank &quot;Tiger&quot; Walton. Like his father, Walton was a football star at Beaver Falls High School; both also starred at the University of Pittsburgh before playing in the NFL for the Washington Redskins, followed by coaching the Redskins and Pittsburgh Steelers.

After initially enrolling at Indiana University Bloomington, Walton attended the University of Pittsburgh on a football scholarship. While there, Walton helped lead the Pittsburgh Panthers to the 1956 Sugar Bowl following the 1955 season and then to the 1956 Gator Bowl in his senior season. In 1955, his junior year Walton was selected an All-American. In 1956, he was named the co-captain of Pitt&#x27;s team, was a unanimous selection as a first-team All-American and was named to the Academic All-American team.

Walton was selected in the second round with the 14th overall pick of the 1957 NFL draft by the Redskins and played with them from 1957 to 1960. In July 1961, he was involved in a three-team trade with the Redskins, Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. The Giants received Walton and end Jim Podoley from the Redskins, the Redskins received Fred Dugan from the Cowboys and placekicker John Aveni, end Jerry Daniels, and defensive halfback Dave Whitsell from the Giants, and the Cowboys received placekicker Allen Green and a sixth round for the 1962 NFL draft from the Giants that the team later used to draft George Andrie.
 Walton played for the Giants from 1961 to 1963. He was placed on injured reserve due to shoulder and knee injures during the 1964 season. He announced his retirement as an active player on June 21, 1965.

Walton scored three touchdowns catches as a TE in one game. He did so twice during the 1962 season: October 28, 1962 against Washington and December 16, 1962, against Dallas. Walton&#x27;s record was tied on September 25, 2014, by Larry Donnell of the New York Giants. October 28, 1962, Walton also caught teammate quarterback Y. A. Tittle&#x27;s single-game record-tying seventh touchdown pass.

==Coaching career==

===NFL===
Walton began his NFL coaching career as a scout for the New York Giants (1965–1968), then transitioned to wide receivers coach (1969–1973). To gain coaching experience from George Allen he moved on to the Redskins as running backs coach (1974–1977) then offensive coordinator from 1978 to 1980. Walton moved to the New York Jets and served as offensive coordinator there for the 1981 and 1982 seasons. His work as offensive coordinator led the Jets to hand over the head-coaching position to him on February 10, 1983, when he succeeded Walt Michaels whose retirement had been announced the previous day. Walton served as the head coach of the New York Jets from 1983 to 1989 and his teams achieved a 53–57–1 record. He guided the Jets into the NFL postseason twice.

After the 1988 season, the Jets gave Walton a three-year extension deal. The 1989 season proved to be a nightmare for Walton and the Jets. They lost six of their first seven games of the season and never recovered on their way to a 4–12 finish (the worst record since 1980), with the last two home games being shutout losses. Fan discontent with the team led to chants of &quot;Joe Must Go&quot; that urged owner Leon Hess to fire him. On December 23, 1989 (three days after the final game), Walton and his staff was fired by Jets general manager Dick Steinberg, who had been hired to manage the team a week earlier. He was replaced by Bruce Coslet.

Walton was recruited by head coach Chuck Noll in 1990 to serve as the offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He served for two years until Chuck Noll retired after the 1991 season. Walton&#x27;s NFL protégés include Rich Kotite, Bud Carson, Joe Theismann, Fran Tarkenton, Norm Snead, Ken O&#x27;Brien and Richard Todd.

===College===
On July 27, 1993, Walton was named the head coach at Robert Morris University of its newly formed Colonials football team. He remained in this position until the conclusion of the 2013 season.

Walton was hired in 1993 to build the program from scratch. After posting 13 wins as an independent his first two years at the helm, Walton led the Colonials into NEC football in 1996 by winning the first of five consecutive conference championships. During the five-year run, Robert Morris posted a 39–13 overall record and 26–2 mark in league play, and recorded the only undefeated season in school history with a 10–0 mark in the 2000 campaign. The Colonials won back-to-back ECAC Bowls in 1996 and 1997, and were crowned NCAA I-AA non-scholarship national champions in both 1999 and 2000.

The Colonials would go on to win a sixth NEC title in 2010 and earn the first-ever FCS playoff bid for the conference. The winningest coach in NEC history, Walton retired with 114 career victories and a 74–47 record against conference opponents during his 20-year run. He was four times as NEC Coach of the Year (1996, 1997, 1999 and 2010), and was an Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year candidate in 2010.

Walton has also helped a fledgling program send three of its brightest stars to the National Football League (NFL). Inaugural running back Tim Hall (1994–95) was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the sixth round (183rd player overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft. Hall played two years for the Oakland Raiders in 1996–97. Former offensive lineman Hank Fraley (1996–1999), a member of the NEC&#x27;s first Hall of Fame induction class in 2010, spent 10 years in the NFL from 2000 to 2010 with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Cleveland Browns and the St. Louis Rams. Fraley has been Offensive Line coach for the Minnesota Vikings since 2015. Former defensive back Robb Butler played with the San Diego Chargers in 2004.
Also to see time in NFL camps from Robert Morris under Walton include former wide receiver DeLonte Perkins (Green Bay Packers), former quarterback Tim Levcik (Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers), AJ Dalton (Detroit Lions).

In 2005, Robert Morris University opened Joe Walton Stadium, the new home to the RMU Colonials. Walton&#x27;s contract to remain the head coach at Robert Morris ran through 2013. In January 2012, RMU announced that Walton would retire at the end of the 2013 season, which would mark his 20th year as Robert Morris Head Coach, and assistant head coach and former Steelers defensive lineman John Banaszak would replace Walton upon his retirement.

==Personal life and honors==
After returning to the Pittsburgh area in 1990 to coach for the Steelers, Walton moved back to his hometown Beaver Falls with his late wife, Ginger, who died in September 2007 after 47 years of marriage. They have two daughters, Jodi and Stacy, and one son, Joe and six grandchildren.

Walton lived in Beaver Falls with his wife Patty Sheehan Walton, whom he married December 10, 2011.

Since retiring from coaching, Walton was inducted into the RMU Athletic Hall of Fame in November 2013. Joe Theismann emceed the dinner banquet honoring Walton. He was named to the Northeast Conference 2013-14 Hall of Fame class and was the 2014 Recipient of the Bob Prince Award presented to him by Steeler Owner Dan Rooney at the Art Rooney Award Dinner in Pittsburgh in April 2014. 
 Joe Walton was inducted into the Larry Bruno Foundation&#x27;s Hall of Achievement in 2012.

He died on August 15, 2021, at age 85.

<text>Ascona ( ) is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland.

It is located on the shore of Lake Maggiore.

The town is a popular tourist destination and holds the yearly Ascona Jazz Festival.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The oldest archaeological finds in Ascona (at S. Materno and S. Michele) go back to the beginnings of the Late Bronze Age. During the expansion of the cemetery in 1952, a necropolis was discovered at S. Materno, where 21 cremation urns were discovered. The urns were either simply buried or covered with a stone slab box. They contained cremated bones and, in some cases, bronze grave goods. Of particular interest are the bronze brooches, which are among the oldest that have been found so far in Switzerland. They also provide important evidence for the relationship of this area to the cultures of the Italian Peninsula. The grave goods have similarities with those from the final phase of the so-called Canegrate culture (named after a large necropolis in Milan). However, the materials used are those of the late Bronze Age north of the Alps. This allowed the cemetery to be dated to the period between the 12th and 10th centuries BC and points to the fact that Ascona took part in trade over the Alps through the Val Mesolcina and over Lake Maggiore with the Po Valley.

Similar objects were found by exploratory excavations in the late 1960s on the castle hill of San Michele. Both fine ceramics and coarse pottery were discovered, which suggests that this area was settled during the Late Bronze Age, even if there is no evidence of the municipal structures. Remains of walls and clay from the Balladrum hill are the only Iron Age objects found in the municipality. However, the exact age is unknown. The only item that has been conclusively identified is a single flagon from the 6th to 5th century BC.

From the Roman Empire, a necropolis with 38 tombs at the foot of the Castle of S. Materno was discovered. The equipment found near the graves points to the period in the mid-1st or 2nd century AD. The necropolis was probably associated with a villa. In 1979–80, an excavation at the church of S. Sebastiano discovered 60 early medieval graves.

===Medieval town===
A fortified settlement is first mentioned in 1186, as &quot;Sconae&quot; (&quot;castrum quod dicitur sconae&quot;), in 1224 as &quot;burgus de schona&quot;. The etymology of the toponym is unknown, there are several suggestions from 19th-century scholarship, all of them uncertain: 
from Latin &quot;scanum&quot; &quot;alluvial sediment&quot;, from Latin &quot;ab abscondito&quot;, or from an uncertain early Romance &quot;asculà&quot; &quot;pasture in uncultivated land&quot;. The German form of the name, &quot;Aschgunen&quot;, is recorded from the 16th century, when Locarno had come under the rule of the Old Swiss Confederacy. It is no longer in use.

In the later Middle Ages, Ascona, Ronco, and Castelletto formed a village cooperative together. In 1321 it was mentioned for the first time, and in 1369, it had its own statutes. The history of Ascona during the Middle Ages is closely linked with that of Locarno. The important role of Ascona is reflected in the designation &quot;plebis Locarni Asconaeque&quot; which it was given in 1369. It is believed that in the 6th century, the Castle of San Michele was the site of a curia (court) and the seat of a &quot;sculdascio&quot; (Lombardic for officer) of the county of Stazzona, who exercised control over the entire parish of Locarno. In 1004, the court rights were transferred from the Archbishop of Milan to the Bishop of Como. In 1189 this gave the castle of San Michele to the Duni, one of the families of the &quot;Capitanei di Locarno&quot;. Other noble families from Locarno (Da Carcano, Castelletto, Muralto) settled in Ascona. They were joined by the Griglioni family that fled the wars between the Guelphs and Ghibellines of Milan.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Duni enlarged their fortress (demolished in the 17th century) and the church of S. Sebastiano as well as having created a plaza around their residential home. The oldest fortification, probably, is the castle of San Materno. At its location, north of the village, there already seems to have been a Roman tower. The fort was occupied as early as the Early Middle Ages. In the 13th century, it was owned by the Orelli and Castelletto families. In the 17th century, only a part of the walls was still preserved. In the course of the 13th century, two new fortifications were built. The first was the Carcani Castle on the shore east of the Church of SS. Pietro e Paolo, and it was already demolished by the 2nd half of the 13th century. The second, was still further east, outside the inhabited area at that time. The Griglioni built a small castle to protect a port. Parts of this castle still exist and have been integrated into modern buildings.

A church is first mentioned in 1264 and was originally consecrated only as the Church of S. Peter. The Church of SS Peter and Paul is first mentioned as a parish church in 1330, and in 1332 as a collegiate church. However, no documents exist which show the separation from the mother church of San Vittore in Muralto and thus the existence of an early medieval parish. The Church of S. Maria della Misericordia was built in 1399–1442. It contains one of the most extensive late Gothic fresco cycles in Switzerland.

===Early Modern Ascona===

In 1640-41, Ascona separated from Ronco and Castelletto. According to the statues adopted in the 14th century, Ascona was represented by three people in the Council of the parish of Locarno. Under the Swiss Confederation, it was represented with two members, alternating every two years with those of Ronco. In 1428, Filippo Maria Visconti gave the villages the market right, which was renewed by the Confederates after the conquest of Locarno in 1513.

In 1580, Bartolomeo Papio, who had become wealthy in Rome, donated 25,000 Scudi to Ascona for the construction of a seminary as long as the work could be completed within three years. In October 1584 the school was finished. After negotiations with Charles Borromeo, the Archbishop of Milan, and representatives of Pope Gregory XIII, it was decided to sell the originally planned &quot;Casa Papio&quot; and to build the &quot;Collegio Papio&quot; college next to the Church of S. Maria della Misericordia. This project ran from 1585 until 1592. In 1616, Cardinal Federico Borromeo, placed the school under the authority of the Congregation of the Oblate of Milan, which led the school until 1798.

The Church of SS Peter and Paul was enlarged in the 16th century, and in 1703, was elevated to have a provost over the church. This was followed by it being raised to have a dean in 1800. In 1617-37 the Church of Madonna della Fontana was built on the northern slopes of Monte Verità, which became a pilgrimage destination. The most remarkable profane building of this era is the Casa Serodine, a building of the 17th century, with a richly decorated facade.

===Modern Ascona===

After various changes, the &quot;Collegio Papio&quot; seminary was secularized in 1852 and then served initially as a high school. It then became a girls&#x27; school and later the &quot;Istituto Elvetico&quot;. In 1879, it returned to its original name and purpose and was placed under the Bishop of Como. In 1885 it came under the authority of the bishop of Lugano. Under the bishop of Lugano, several religious orders administered the seminary, including the Salesians (1894–1910), the Assumptionists (1910–14), and finally the Benedictines (since 1924). In the 20th century, the building was rebuilt and expanded several times (1924–27, after a fire in 1960, 1975–76, and 1992).

In the second half of the 18th century, the Church of SS Peter and Paul was extensively rebuilt. In 1859, the façade and the south side were totally redone in a Gothic Revival style. A further renovation began in 1948 but was aborted after the 18th-century vaults collapsed.

In 1798 Ascona elected to join the Helvetic Republic, and was granted a certain degree of local self-government. French troops moved into the town but were driven out, and it was then occupied by Austrian units. When the canton of Ticino was founded in 1803, Ascona became a political municipality.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the local economy depended mostly on crops, livestock, and fisheries. A smaller, but important source of income was the emigration of builders, architects, and artists to Rome and Tuscany. The most famous Ascona artist families were the Serodine, Abbondio, Pancaldi, and Pisoni. In the 19th century, linen production and mills offered job opportunities to the locals. In the second half of the 19th century, a dynamite factory operated in Ascona, but it closed after repeated explosions in 1874.
In the 20th century, tourism became a major part of the local economy. Since 1970 the number of second homes has increased substantially, and at the end of the 20th century, during the summer season, around 20,000 to 25,000 visitors came to Ascona each year. Closely connected with the rise of tourism was population growth in the 1920s. In 1925 an extensive redistribution of land ownership allowed non-locals to purchase land. By 1934, the number of landowners included not only 299 Ticinesi, but 88 other Swiss, 41 German, 35 Italian, and 31 foreign nationals. The settlement area has expanded since 1960. The expansion has proceeded more and more towards the north, so that Locarno and Ascona form a single agglomeration. Two bridges connect Ascona with the left bank of the Maggia river. The one at Solduno, which was built 1815–16, and rebuilt in 1887 after the flood of 1868, was totally replaced in 1996. The second bridge, further into the valley, was built in 1974–80. Since 1947, Ascona has also had an airport; however, it is likely to close in the near future.

In 1945 negotiations over World War II surrender plans took place between U.S. and Nazi German representatives in Ascona.

=== Monte Verità ===

&quot;Monte Verità&quot; (&quot;Mount Truth&quot;) was so named at the beginning of the 20th century, when a &quot;colony&quot; was founded by proponents of primitive socialism and anarchy on a hill formerly known as &quot;Monescia&quot;, just to the north-west of the town of Ascona.

The colony attracted a large number of artists, anarchists, and other famous people, including Hermann Hesse, Hans Habe, Carl Jung, Erich Maria Remarque, Hugo Ball, Else Lasker-Schüler, Stefan George, Isadora Duncan, Paul Klee, Rudolf Steiner, Mary Wigman, Gyula Háy, Max Picard, Ernst Toller, Henri van de Velde, Rudolf Laban, Frieda and Else von Richthofen, Otto Gross, Erich Mühsam, Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach, and Gustav Stresemann.

<text>William Vanderpool &quot;Van&quot; Hilleary (born June 20, 1959) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for Tennessee&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 1995 to 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life and career==
Hilleary was born in Dayton, Tennessee, the seat of Rhea County, and raised in nearby Spring City, where his family operated a textile manufacturing concern. He graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1981 where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. He participated in the Air Force ROTC program at the University of Tennessee and served on active duty from 1982 to 1984 and has been a member of the Air Force Reserve since that time. Hilleary graduated from the Cumberland School of Law of Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama in 1990. He served two volunteer tours of duty during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. While in the Gulf War, Hilleary flew 24 missions as a navigator on C-130 aircraft.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Campaigns===
Following his return from the Middle East, he entered a race for the Tennessee State Senate in 1992. His opponent was Anna Belle Clement O&#x27;Brien, younger sister and political confidante of the late former governor of Tennessee Frank G. Clement. While Hilleary was defeated, he ran such a competitive race that he was recruited to enter the Republican primary in 1994 for the Fourth Congressional District. This seat was open as incumbent six-term Democrat Jim Cooper retired to run for the United States Senate. Hilleary easily won the Republican primary and faced Democratic nominee Jeff Whorley, a former aide to Cooper, in the general election. It was the first serious bid the Republicans had made for the district since its creation after the 1980 census. Hilleary won by a 14-point margin. Even considering the massive Republican tide that swept through the state that year, Hilleary&#x27;s convincing win came as something of a surprise.

On paper, the 4th District was not regarded as safe for either party. It stretched from the Virginia border in East Tennessee to the Mississippi border in Middle Tennessee. Prior to Cooper&#x27;s election in 1982, much of the district&#x27;s eastern portion had not been represented by a Democrat since before the Civil War. However, its configuration made it very difficult to unseat an incumbent in a normal election year. Then, as now, the district covers five television markets (the Tri-Cities, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Huntsville, Alabama) and two time zones. Frequently, advertising budgets in the 4th rival those for statewide races. Continuing this pattern, Hilleary was reelected three times from this district without much difficulty, and actually increased his margin each time; his 56 percent in 1994 would be the lowest margin of his congressional career. He even won easily in 1996 even as Bill Clinton carried the district in the presidential election mainly on the strength of Al Gore&#x27;s presence on the ticket; Gore had represented much of the western portion of the district in Congress from 1977 to 1983.

===Tenure===
Hilleary had a conservative voting record. For instance, Hilleary was opposed to any form of a state income tax, which was a major issue in the state legislature at the time. In each of his three subsequent Congressional races, Hilleary won with an increasing margin. Due to the 4th&#x27;s configuration, Hilleary also became known over a large portion of the state.

==2002 Tennessee gubernatorial election==

Hilleary was considered a logical choice for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2002, withstanding a challenge from the party&#x27;s moderate wing made by Jim Henry, former minority leader in the Tennessee House of Representatives and former mayor of Kingston. Henry&#x27;s race was largely supported and financed by members of the inner circle of unpopular outgoing GOP governor Don Sundquist, a fact resented by many grassroots activists, and Hilleary defeated him by a wide margin.

Hilleary&#x27;s opponent in the general election was Phil Bredesen, a multimillionaire former mayor of Nashville. Bredesen had run for governor in 1994 and lost to Sundquist. At first, Bredesen agreed to be bound by a relatively new Tennessee state law limiting the amount of money one could contribute to one&#x27;s own campaign for elective office. However, the state attorney general subsequently issued an opinion that such a law was unconstitutional and hence unenforceable, as the United States Supreme Court had previously ruled a similar federal law with regard to federal campaigns. This freed Bredesen to use his considerable wealth to self-finance his campaign. Faced with huge and potentially overwhelming resources against him, Hilleary reversed his previous position on PACs and began to actively solicit donations from them.

One of the major issues of the race was TennCare, the huge state-supported managed care program that had supplanted Medicaid in Tennessee. Hilleary displayed a high level of knowledge about this issue in a debate between the two, despite the fact that Bredesen had made most of his fortune as a managed health care executive. However, polling seemed to indicate that one of the major factors with public support of Bredesen was his knowledge of this issue. Bredesen was also a moderate Democrat; Republican charges against &quot;ultra-liberal Democrats&quot; could not be made to stick to him with any real degree of success. Another problem for Hilleary was that Bredesen showed himself able to raise support in East Tennessee (Hilleary&#x27;s home region) far more readily than could previous Democratic candidates, especially considering that Bredesen was from Nashville. In addition, questions were raised regarding Hilleary&#x27;s performance as a member of the House Budget Committee.

Hilleary nonetheless received over 48% of the vote. Bredesen defeated him largely by doing far better than expected in heavily Republican East Tennessee, an area where Democrats are not normally competitive except in statewide landslides. For instance, Bredesen carried Knox County, the largest county in East Tennessee, by a few hundred votes; in contrast, George W. Bush won Knox County two years later by over 40,000 votes.

== 2006 Senate campaign ==
Hilleary was a candidate for the United States Senate seat then held by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who did not run for re-election, fulfilling his promise to not to serve more than two terms when first elected in 1994.

Despite over 80% name recognition, Hilleary placed a distant third with a mere 17% of the vote in the primary, behind fellow former Congressman Ed Bryant, who received 34% and the winner, former Chattanooga mayor Bob Corker, who won with a 48% plurality. Surprisingly, Hilleary lost 13 of the 22 counties in his old district. Hilleary endorsed Corker for the general election.

== Consultant ==
Shortly after the November 2004 election, Hilleary moved his family to Murfreesboro, just outside Nashville. He now lives there primarily on weekends and through the week was employed as a consultant in Washington, D.C. until December 2018.

According to a disclosure of personal finances from 2004 and part of 2005, as required by his 2006 Senate candidacy, Hilleary made $300,000 in salary in 2004 from Washington lobbying firm Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, and more than $150,000 in salary from the firm through August 12, 2005.

One of his clients was the Lumbee Indian Tribe of North Carolina, which was seeking federal status from Congress and $77 million in funding for education, health care and economic development that would come with recognition. The tribe was recognized in 1956, but was not awarded the same monetary benefits given to other American Indian groups. Another client was Pennsylvania House Speaker John M. Perzel. Other clients listed by Hilleary included the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Balfour Ventures, Federal-Mogul Corporation, L-3 Communications, SMS Holdings Corp. and VPI Technologies.

==Later congressional staff work==
On December 11, 2018, it was announced that Hilleary would be returning to Congress as the Chief of Staff for John Rose, Representative-elect for Tennessee&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which contains much of the territory that he had once represented.

<doc id="1089648" wikidata="Q2407894" url="?curid=1089648" title="Harry Gant">
<text>Harold Phil Gant (born January 10, 1940) is an American former stock car racing driver best known for driving the No. 33 Skoal Bandit car on the NASCAR Winston Cup Series circuit during the 1980s and 1990s. Gant won 31 NASCAR races combined between the Cup Series and Busch Series, and had a four-race win streak on the Cup circuit in 1991. Gant had a best result of second in the points championship in 1984.

Gant holds the record for the oldest driver to win a Cup Series race (52). He was known for his many nicknames such as &quot;Handsome Harry&quot;, &quot;the Bandit&quot;, &quot;High Groove Harry&quot;, &quot;Hard Luck Harry&quot;, and &quot;Mr. September&quot; for his 1991 win streak.

==Nicknames==
Gant gained a lot of nicknames throughout his racing career. Early on, &quot;Sug&quot; Thompson, announcer at New Asheville Speedway, nicknamed Harry &quot;The Taylorsville Flash&quot;. He was later known as &quot;Handsome Harry Gant&quot; due to his Hollywood-style good looks, the &quot;Bandit&quot; after his longtime sponsor Skoal Bandit, &quot;Mr. September&quot; after winning four consecutive Winston Cup races and two Busch Series races in September 1991, &quot;High Groove Harry&quot; after the high line he often took through the corner, and &quot;Hard Luck Harry&quot; for numerous second place finishes in the beginning of his career and later numerous mechanical failures and crashes not of his own doing while leading or running well with Mach I racing.

==Career prior to Winston Cup==

The North Carolina native began his racing career at the old dirt track in Hickory. He built a hobby class car with his friends, and took turns behind the wheel. Gant became the full-time driver and won the track championship. Hickory Speedway was paved in 1967 after Ned Jarrett became the promoter. Gant excelled on the asphalt, and won his first race in the sportsman division.

He won over 300 races with the car builder and crew chief Kenneth H. Sigmon, in the NASCAR Sportsman on his way to winning three national championships, in 1972, 1973, and 1974. He finished second three times in the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division in 1969, 1976, and 1977. He finished in the top 10 of the final points standing in several other years.

He sold half of his construction business in 1979 upon deciding to race full-time in the Winston Cup Series.

==Winston Cup career==

Gant made his first Cup start in 1973 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, finishing eleventh in the No. 90 Ford for Donlavey Racing despite initially not being interested in the opportunity. He made six starts over the next four years and had two top-ten finishes. His first full season in Winston Cup was in 1979. He competed for the rookie of the year honors against Dale Earnhardt and Terry Labonte. He finished fourth in the overall rookie battle in the No. 47 Race Hill Farm car for Jack Beebe. He split the next season between the No. 47 and the No. 75 RahMoc Enterprises entry, finishing 21st in points.

After starting out the 1981 season driving for various teams, he moved to the No. 33 Skoal Bandit Pontiac, which was owned by Hal Needham and Burt Reynolds, and Leo Jackson after 1988. Gant debuted with the team by placing second at Darlington Raceway, followed by five more second-place finishes and three poles, ending the season third in points standings. He stayed with the team for the rest of his career.

Gant finished second 10 times before winning his first Winston Cup race, at Martinsville April 25, 1982, in the Virginia National Bank 500 and he finished fourth in the final points standings. In 1983, Gant only won once at Darlington in the Transouth 400 and collect 10 top 5s and 16 top ten finishes en route to seventh in the final points standings. In 1984, Harry Gant notched 3 poles, 15 top five finishes, and 23 top ten finishes and won at Pocono and Martinsville in the fall, he ended up finishing second to eventual Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte. In 1985, Gant won at Martinsville in the spring, and at Dover and at North Wilkesboro in the fall, notching a career best for Gant up to that point. He finished third in championship standings, 259 points behind eventual champion Darrell Waltrip. Gant went winless for three years from 1986-1988 and in 1989, he broke a three-year winless streak winning at Darlington in the spring which caused the veteran driver to exclaim &quot;The Bandit is back&quot; in victory lane. He did not win again in 1989 but finished seventh in the final points standings.

Gant won the International Race of Champions (IROC) championship in 1985. He tied on points with Darrell Waltrip but was awarded the title on tiebreak by finishing higher in the final race: a photo-finish win over Labonte at Michigan International Speedway

Gant drove the No. 33 in the 1985 Talladega NASCAR race with the first telemetry data system ever installed on a race car. The data from the car was sent to the CBS television network and broadcast during the TV coverage of the race.

==1990s and Mr. September streak==
Harry Gant entered the decade with a win at Pocono in the spring of 1990. He finished 17th in the final points standings, with 6 top 5s and 9 top 10s. In 1991, Gant had a career year. He won the 1991 Winston 500 in the spring, gambling on fuel mileage. Fellow competitor Rick Mast drafted behind Gant to give him a push the last few laps but let off in the final laps to preserve the victory. Gant earned the nickname &quot;Mr. September&quot; in 1991 after winning all four September Cup races (Darlington, Richmond, Dover and Martinsville) and two Busch races (Richmond and Dover) at age 51. His crew chief was Andy Petree. The four consecutive cup victories tied the modern era record set in 1972. Dominating at the next race at North Wilkesboro Speedway, Gant had his brakes fail, ending his hopes of five consecutive victories. Gant scored 5 victories in 1991, also notching 15 top-five finishes and 17 top tens, and finishing fourth in the final point standings. Gant followed up 1991 with a strong 1992 and finished 4th in points again. One of five drivers in contention for the championship, six finishes of 13th or worse in the final races doomed his championship hopes. Gant won at Dover in the spring, and he scored his last Cup victory on August 16, 1992, at the Champion Spark Plug 400 at Michigan International Speedway, gambling on fuel. This was also the final victory for Oldsmobile in Cup competition. Harry Gant and the Leo Jackson team switched to Chevrolets in 1993, and at the end of the season, Gant announced that 1994 would be his last season. Gant finished his career with a pole and seven top-ten finishes, finishing 25th in the final point standings.

In 1996, Gant substituted for the injured Bill Elliott in the 1996 Winston Select, driving Elliott&#x27;s No. 94 McDonald&#x27;s Ford Thunderbird after Elliott&#x27;s injuries at Talladega. Gant also ran a partial season in the Craftsman Truck Series in 1996, driving his own No. 33 Westview Capital Chevrolet C/K. He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame on April 27, 2006. 

Currently, Gant continues to work on his 300-acre ranch in North Carolina and enjoys riding his motorcycle. In 2015, he was in attendance at Darlington for the Southern 500 to take part in the retro weekend. He also still works on roofs and carpentry in his spare time. Gant once admitted that he &quot;was a good race-car driver but a great carpenter.&quot;

==Cup records==
Gant holds the record as the oldest driver ever to win a Cup Series race () and as the oldest driver ever to collect his first career Cup victory (42 years and 105 days). He is the second oldest driver to win in NASCAR&#x27;s second-level circuit, now known as the Xfinity Series, after Dick Trickle. In his career he has collected 18 Cup wins and one runner-up finish in 1984 and third in 1981 and 1985, 21 Busch Series wins, and three runner-up finishes in the Busch Series championship (69, 76, and 77). In 1985 won the IROC title. He won four races in a row in 1991 tying a &quot;new era&quot; (1972–present) record and came in second in the fifth race. His five Winston Cup and five Busch Grand National wins in 1991 made him the only driver, at that time, to post the most wins in both series in the same year, although he tied with Davey Allison with five Cup wins (Allison also scored a victory in the non-points All-Star Race).

==Movie appearances==
Gant appeared in the 1983 Burt Reynolds movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;. He also gave a short interview in the film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and was mentioned for spinning out in the Daytona 500 late in the movie (although it was actually the No. 26 of Brett Bodine).
He also appeared as a mob henchman in the 1984 movie &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;. His line in the film was &quot;Better not let the boss hear you say that.&quot;

<text>The Tyrones were an American rock and roll group, formed in Philadelphia in the 1950s. The group was run by Tyrone DeNittis and featured George Lesser. Their hit songs included &quot;Blast Off&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Shook&quot;, and they appeared singing &quot;Blast Off&quot; in the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;. Sponsored in part by Bill Haley, the Tyrones recorded a number of Haley/Comets-written songs. It is also believed that several Comets including Frank Beecher took part in the recording sessions, which were later &quot;cleaned up&quot; by Johnny Grande and Billy Williamson. DeNittis&#x27; brother, Al Dean, briefly joined the Comets as sax player in 1960. He may also have recorded with the Tyrones. 

The band&#x27;s music was used in the soundtracks of the films The Iron Giant and &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;.

<doc id="1089657" wikidata="Q3488793" url="?curid=1089657" title="Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery">
<text>Sodom is an obscene Restoration closet drama, published in 1684. The work has been attributed to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, though its authorship is disputed. Determining the date of composition and attribution are complicated owing mostly to misattribution of evidence for and against Rochester&#x27;s authorship in Restoration and later texts.

== Plot ==
The play consists of five acts in rhyming couplets. There are two prologues, two epilogues and a short final speech. The play begins with Bolloxinion, King of Sodom, authorising same-sex sodomy as an acceptable sexual practice within the realm. General Buggeranthos reports that this policy is welcomed by the soldiers, who spend less on prostitutes as a consequence, but has deleterious effects on women of the kingdom who have recourse to &quot;dildoes and dogs&quot;. Prince Pricket and Princess Swivia commit incest with one another. With the court and country reduced to erotic madness, the court physician counsels: &quot;Fuck women, and let Bugg&#x27;ry be no more&quot;. The king himself, however is unconvinced, while the Queen dies of venereal disease. Amid the appearance of demons, fire, and brimstone, Bolloxinion declares his intention to retire to a cavern and die in the act of sodomising his favourite – Pockenello.

== Cast ==
*Bolloxinion – King of Sodom
*Cuntigratia – his Queen
*Pricket – young Prince
*Swivia – Princess
*Buggeranthos – General of the Army
*Pockenello – Prince and favourite of the King
*Borastus – Buggermaster-General
*Pene &amp; Tooly – Pimps of Honour
*Officina – Maid of Honour
*Fuckadilla – Maid of Honour
*Cunticulla – Maid of Honour
*Clytoris – Maid of Honour
*Flux – Physician to the King
*Vertuso – Dildo- and Merkin-Maker for the Court

== Interpretation ==
&quot;Sodom&quot; merits attention not just as an historical piece of scabrous literature, but also as a disguised satire on the court of Charles II and especially of his apparent willingness to tolerate Catholicism in England at a time when that religion was officially proscribed. Written presumably at the time of Charles&#x27;s 1672 Declaration of Indulgence (which promulgated official toleration of Catholics and others), &quot;Sodom&quot; delineates in its racy plot a king much like Charles whose insistence on promoting his sexual preference for sodomy can be read as an analogue to the debate in England at the time about the king&#x27;s real motive in pushing religious toleration.

== Performance history ==

&quot;Sodom&quot; is popularly classified as closet drama, which means it has not had a major performance for centuries. The play was publicly performed in 1986 for six weekends at Broom Street Theater in Madison, Wisconsin. &quot;Sodom&quot; was revived at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011 by the Movement Theatre Company, in what is described as a &quot;reconstructed&quot; version.

==Modern media==
In the film &quot;The Libertine&quot;, Johnny Depp, as Rochester, is seen staging &quot;Sodom&quot; in front of an outraged Charles II, with Rochester taking the role of the King of Sodom.

<doc id="1089658" wikidata="Q239405" url="?curid=1089658" title="Tahiti national football team">
<text>The Tahiti men&#x27;s national football team (, ) represents French Polynesia and is controlled by the Fédération Tahitienne de Football. The team consists of a selection of players from French Polynesia, not just Tahiti, and has competed in the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) since 1990.

Tahiti is traditionally one of the stronger footballing nations of the Pacific Islands, with the second-best record at the football section of the South Pacific Games, with five victories. They were runners-up in the first three instalments of the Nations Cup (1973, 1980 and 1996). The nation went through a period of less success, but showed promise when it qualified for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt. This success was followed up with the title of 2012 OFC Nations Cup, becoming the first team other than Australia and New Zealand to win the competition. Tahiti thus qualified to the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup held in Brazil.

==History==
Tahiti played its first full match on 21 September 1952, at home against New Zealand, drawing 2–2. Seven days later, the two teams played again and New Zealand won 5–3. On 30 September, they played each other for a third time, and Tahiti gained its first victory, by 2–0. However, it is unknown whether this was a full international match.

In September 1953, Tahiti played three matches in New Caledonia against its national side, losing the first 5–0 and the later two 4–1. They then travelled to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) and beat its national side 4–2 twice. In 1969, touring World Champions England beat Tahiti 4–1 in an exhibition match. In 1989, under the leadership of Napoleon Spitz, the official federation was created.

Tahiti entered its first World Cup qualification with the aim of reaching the 1994 World Cup, held in the United States. They were placed in Group A alongside Australia and the Solomon Islands, and played their first match away to the Solomon Islands in Honiara on 11 July 1992. Eric Etaeta equalised for Tahiti to make it 1–1 in the 76th minute. On 11 September, Tahiti hosted Australia in Papeete and lost 3–0. The next fixture was again against Australia, and resulted in a 2–0 away defeat in Brisbane on 20 September. On 9 October, in Papeete, Tahiti defeated the Solomon Islands 4–2. Tahiti&#x27;s first goal was scored as an 8th-minute penalty from Reynald Temarii, a politician and current president of the OFC. However, Tahiti finished second to Australia in the group and did not advance.

===2012 OFC Nations Cup===
In 2012, the new edition of the tournament occurred in the Solomon Islands with the host country, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tahiti, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa (winner of the qualifying tournament) playing the competition. Tahiti defeated New Caledonia in the final in Lawson Tama Stadium 1–0 with a goal by Steevy Chong Hue and became the first team other than Australia (no longer part of OFC) and New Zealand to be crowned Oceania champions.

===2013 Confederations Cup===

By winning the 2012 OFC Nations Cup, Tahiti qualified for the 2013 Confederations Cup, held in Brazil, for the first time. Tahiti is the first – and, following the tournament&#x27;s abolition, only – team which participated in the Confederations Cup but has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. On 17 June 2013, Tahiti lost 1–6 to Nigeria in the 2013 Confederations Cup in Belo Horizonte, with Jonathan Tehau scoring the goal for Tahiti in the second half with a header from a corner; Tahiti fans still rejoiced in the prospect of scoring a goal in an international tournament. On 20 June, Tahiti lost 10–0 against Spain to equal their largest ever lost against New Zealand nine years earlier. On 23 June 2013, Tahiti was beaten 8–0 by Uruguay.

In all, Tahiti conceded 24 goals and scored 1 to end with a goal differential of −23, the worst of any national team in any major competition. However, even with the poor record and heavy defeats, Tahiti&#x27;s underdog qualities gathered significant respect from the people of Brazil, who always cheered for them in every match. Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque, and strikers Fernando Torres and David Villa – who scored four and three goals respectively against Tahiti – complimented the team&#x27;s fair play.

===2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)===
After two matches canceled due to COVID-19, the Tahitians returned to the qualifying tournament for the World Cup in Qatar. The Toa Aito lost to Solomon Islands and finished second in Group A. Solomon Islands led in the score in the 20th minute, the Tahitians equalized the score when Alvin Tehau scored in the 26th minute. Solomon Islands then made the difference on the return from the half on a lightning counterattack before taking the lead more widely at the end of the match 1–3.

==Rivalries==
A historical sporting rivalry exists between the two French Pacific overseas collectivities, Tahiti and New Caledonia. They compete regularly in regional and, since 2006, international competitions. In 2012, Tahiti led the number of titles won (1 OFC Nations Cup, 5 gold medals at the South Pacific Games, 2 at the South Pacific mini-games, against 6 gold at the South Pacific Games for New Caledonia). As of their last match in 2018, out of the 62 matches played since 1953, the New Caledonia has 28 wins against 25 for Tahiti and 9 draws.

<text>IM Pegasi is a variable binary star system approximately 329 light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus. With an apparent magnitude of 5.7, it is visible to the naked eye. Increased public awareness of it is due to its use as the guide star for the Gravity Probe B general relativity experiment. It was chosen for this purpose because its microwave radio emissions are observable with a large radio telescope network on the ground in such a manner that its precise position can be related by interferometry to distant quasars.

The two components of the binary system includes a K-type giant star and a G-type main sequence star. The primary star is estimated to be 1.8 times as massive and 13 times the diameter of the Sun. The secondary star is estimated to be similar to the Sun in size and mass. They orbit their common barycenter in a period precisely estimated to be 24.64877 days.
The variability of IM Pegasi is due to the active chromosphere of the giant primary star, which causes brightness changes of a few tenths of a magnitude as it rotates.

<text>Duke is the tenth studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 28 March 1980 on Charisma Records. The album followed a period of inactivity for the band in early 1979. Phil Collins moved to Vancouver, Canada, in an effort to salvage his failing first marriage, while Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for &quot;Duke&quot; and some was later reworked for his first solo album, &quot;Face Value&quot;. &quot;Duke&quot; contained a mix of individually written songs and tracks that evolved from jam sessions in mid-1979, while recording took place at the end of the year. The break in activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album an easy one to work on.

&quot;Duke&quot; was positively received by music critics, who praised the album for bridging the band&#x27;s progressive rock-oriented past, such as the closing ten-minute &quot;Duke&#x27;s Travels&quot;/&quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; suite, with their more pop rock-oriented, commercially accessible direction, as displayed on the hit singles &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, and &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;. It reached No. 11 in the US, and became their first album to reach No. 1 in the UK. It has since been certified Platinum in both countries.

==Background==
By 1978, Genesis were a trio of lead singer and drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford. They had survived the departure of original frontman Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett and released the album &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;, which included the top ten single &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;. The group were still touring successfully, and enjoyed the songwriting collaborations among the three of them. They decided to take a break before writing and recording a new album, which would be largely group-written in a rehearsal room, without many pre-conceived ideas.

The group&#x27;s touring schedule had put particular pressure on Collins, whose marriage was at risk of collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned him that if he committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis were on the verge of an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver to try and rebuild his family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for &quot;Sounds&quot;, Collins said, &quot;I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we&#x27;d have had to organise ourselves differently.&quot; He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.

Banks and Rutherford suggested the band take an extended hiatus, hoping Collins would save his marriage and that the band could work with him in Vancouver. Banks recorded his solo album &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; at Polar Studios in Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot;, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album &quot;Face Value&quot; at his home in Shalford, Surrey. As well as playing piano and synthesizers, he had recently picked up a Roland CR-78 drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.

==Writing and recording==

In autumn 1979, Banks and Rutherford moved in with Collins in Shalford to start rehearsals on &quot;Duke&quot;. Collins had written a large number of songs, but he felt many of them would not suit Genesis, while Banks and Rutherford were short of material having just recorded their solo albums. The three decided each member should contribute two of their own songs for the band to work on. Banks put forward &quot;Heathaze&quot; and &quot;Cul-de-Sac&quot;, Rutherford used &quot;Man of Our Times&quot; and &quot;Alone Tonight&quot;, and Collins had &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. The remainder of the songs were written together in rehearsals. Banks later regretted not choosing Collins&#x27; &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; for the album. His track &quot;Cul-de-Sac&quot; became a problem for Collins to get into as its overall style and lyrical content no longer interested him, and Collins said Banks realised that he should have kept the song for his solo output. &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; is a song Collins wrote during his divorce from his first wife. Biographer Ray Coleman said the song is &quot;a searing mixture of a love letter and a lament for the loss of his children&quot;. Collins recalled Banks and Rutherford chose to include the song &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; as it had a Beach Boys feel.

The group found the writing process easier and more enjoyable than &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;, which was primarily songs written in advance individually by the members. Rutherford summarised his time writing songs for &quot;Duke&quot; as &quot;getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly&quot;. Banks reasoned much of the band&#x27;s refreshed attitude was down to not having worked together in a while, which resulted in good ideas being put forward, something that he said had not happened for some time. Collins felt the band interacted &quot;as a group much better ... there&#x27;s definitely a side to us coming out which wasn&#x27;t on the last album; the playing side&quot;. Rutherford would later describe the writing process for the album, alongside the one for &quot;Abacab&quot;, as a &quot;rethink&quot; of Genesis&#x27; approach, refocusing their output to group writing and improvisation. In contrast to earlier Genesis albums, most tracks were short with the exception of the ten-minute &quot;Duke&#x27;s Travels&quot;/&quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; suite that closed the album.
The group went to Polar Studios to record the album, starting on 12 November 1979, and recording up to the end of the year. As with several earlier albums, production duties were shared by the band and regular co-producer David Hentschel. Collins used the Roland CR-78 drum machine for &quot;Duchess&quot;; the first time he used one on a Genesis song.

The cover art was drawn by French illustrator and taken from his book &quot;L&#x27;Alphabet d&#x27;Albert&quot;, published in 1979. The band liked his work and decided to use it as the cover, but Collins maintained the character depicted is neither the album&#x27;s titular character nor related to any song on it.

===The &quot;Duke Suite&quot;===
&quot;Behind the Lines&quot; was the first song arranged for the album and &quot;Duchess&quot; came about from rhythms that Collins had played on his set of drum pads. In its original form, &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Guide Vocal&quot;, &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, &quot;Duke&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; were one 30-minute track that told a story of a fictional character named Albert which had a working title of &quot;Duke&quot;. The group chose this name because the fanfare melodies on &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; and &quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; conjured an image of royalty. The band decided against sequencing the tracks this way on the album, partly to avoid comparisons to their 23-minute track &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, but also to have certain segments of the suite, such as &quot;Duchess&quot; and &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, released as singles. The six tracks were performed live on the album&#x27;s supporting tour with Collins introducing it as &quot;The Story of Albert&quot;. &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; was originally a short connecting piece in the middle of this medley, but the band enjoyed playing it so much, they decided to double its length and make it more of a standout track. It came from a piece that Rutherford discarded from &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot; and a separate piece from Banks that they joined together. The group considered placing the band-written songs on side one and the individually written tracks on the other, but this was rejected. Rutherford described the final running order as &quot;a very balanced album&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Duke&quot; was released in the US on 24 March 1980 and in the UK on 28 March. It was the band&#x27;s greatest commercial success at the time of its release; it spent two weeks at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned three singles; &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 58 in the US; &quot;Duchess&quot; reached No. 46 in the UK; &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; reached No. 42 in the UK and No. 14 in the US. &quot;Duke&quot; was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry on 3 July 1980 and by the Recording Industry Association of America on 11 March 1988.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Duke&quot; received a mostly positive reception from music critics. In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke noted that &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; is &quot;vibrant rock &amp; roll&quot; and thought that &quot;Man of Our Times&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Duke&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and &quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; &quot;possess a refreshing urgency&quot;. Fricke points out the band&#x27;s losses without Gabriel and Hackett in the line-up, yet summarised &quot;Duke&quot; as &quot;comforting: a reassurance that Genesis aren&#x27;t for an exodus yet.&quot; &quot;Sounds&quot;″ Hugh Fielder gave the album four stars out of five, enjoying the opening of &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; and considering Collins&#x27;s vocals to be &quot;more convincing than ... before&quot;. He felt the first side was better than the second, and criticised some lyrics, but concluded &quot;no Genesis fan could be disappointed&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Steve Pond described the album&#x27;s music as &quot;identifiably Genesis, but it is toned-down&quot; and &quot;a more confident and successful album than &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;&quot;. He criticised the album as inconsistent with a lack of &quot;melodic invention&quot; on side one, but thought &quot;Duke&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Duke&#x27;s End&quot; were &quot;one of the best and most consistent pieces of music that band has made in some time&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt &quot;Duke&quot; was the Genesis album that &quot;leaped into the fray&quot; of pop music but retained &quot;a heavy dose&quot; of progressive rock with the &quot;Duke&quot; suite. Erlewine thought the album comes off &quot;a little bombastic&quot; at times, with &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; being the two tracks that &quot;showcase the new version of Genesis at its absolute best&quot;.

===Tour===

Genesis supported the album with a 78-date tour across Europe and North America, between 17 March to 30 June 1980. They were joined by drummer Chester Thompson and guitarist Daryl Stuermer. As the group had not embarked on a full scale UK tour since 1977, the tour began with a 40-date trek across the country, which saw all 108,000 available tickets sold within hours of going on sale. A 40-minute excerpt from the performance at the Lyceum Ballroom in London was broadcast on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and released as a bonus feature on the 2007 reissue of &quot;Duke&quot;. Recordings from the tour were released on &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; (1982), &quot;Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992&quot; (2000), and &quot;BBC Broadcasts&quot; (2023).

===Reissues===
A digitally remastered version of &quot;Duke&quot; was released on CD in 1994 on Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the US and Canada. The CD included the album&#x27;s original booklet, artwork and lyrics. It was reissued again in 2007 as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set, which included a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix and a DVD of bonus features including band interviews, music videos, live performances and tour programs.

<text>The Last Juror is a 2004 legal thriller novel by John Grisham, first published by Doubleday on February 3, 2004.

==Plot introduction==
The story is set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi from 1970 to 1979. Clanton is also the venue for John Grisham&#x27;s first novel &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; which was published in 1989. Some of the characters appear in both novels with the same occupation and characteristics. Although &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; was published 15 years before &quot;The Last Juror&quot;, it took place in 1985 (on the first page of Chapter 3, it notes the date as Wednesday, May 15), which is a year after Grisham formed the idea for &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, his first novel, and began writing it. Therefore, the characters who appear in both novels, such as Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner, have matured in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. Harry Rex Vonner also appears in the novel &quot;The Summons&quot;, published in 2002, as an adviser of the protagonist Ray Atlee.

Some references in the book are clearly hinting at things known to readers of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. For example, in 1970 most blacks in Ford County don&#x27;t take part in elections - taking for granted that since whites are the great majority in the county, no black candidate would have chance of being elected to local office. However, as &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; makes clear, a decade later a black Sheriff would be duly elected, with the overwhelming support of blacks and whites alike.

The novel is divided into three parts. The first covers the trial of Danny Padgitt, the second focuses on Willie adjusting to life in Clanton, and the third includes the main events, the murder of the jurors.

==Plot==
In 1970, a 23-year-old college dropout named Willie Traynor realizes that his dreams of becoming a Pulitzer-winning journalist will never come true. He moves to Clanton, Mississippi for an internship at the local newspaper, &quot;The Ford County Times&quot;. However, the aging editor, Wilson Caudle, drives the newspaper into bankruptcy through years of neglect and mismanagement. Willie spontaneously decides to buy the paper for $50,000, using money borrowed from his wealthy grandmother, and becomes the editor and owner of the &quot;Times&quot;.

Soon afterwards, Danny Padgitt, a member of a notorious local family, brutally rapes and murders a young widow, Rhoda Kassellaw. When Traynor publishes a front-page photo of the blood-spattered Padgitt being led into jail, readership increases. However, Willie is accused of yellow journalism and pre-judging Padgitt. Later, Willie runs a human interest story about Callie Ruffin, a local black woman whose seven children (among eight) all gained doctorates and teaching positions in various universities. In the process of researching the story, Willie becomes a close friend of Callie and her family.

In the process of jury selection for Padgitt&#x27;s trial, Callie becomes the first black person to serve on a Ford County jury. Though far from enthusiastic about the prospect of having to pass a death sentence, Callie - who had been active of the Civil Rights Movement - does not shirk her civic duty. In court, Padgitt openly threatens to kill each of the jurors if he&#x27;s convicted. But though the jury convicts Padgitt, they are divided on whether to sentence him to death row, so he is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Mississippi State Penitentiary. Unconfirmed rumors persist that Hank Hooten, the deputy prosecutor in the case, had been the lover of the victim - which, if true, would constitute a conflict of interest.
In the ensuing years, as the &quot;Times&quot; becomes highly successful and steadily increases circulation, Willie keeps an eye on Padgitt. He campaigns against the extremely favorable conditions which his family procured for him in prison. However, Padgitt is paroled after nine years. Immediately after his return to Clanton, two of the former jurors are killed by a sniper rifle and fear spreads through the county. Callie&#x27;s children and neighbors organize to guard her day and night. The Padgitt family offers alibis as to Danny&#x27;s whereabouts during the murders. This is taken with great skepticism, but with no tangible proof to the contrary, the authorities hesitate to take action.

Callie reveals that the victims were jurors who voted against sentencing Padgitt to death. A third juror - who also opposed a death sentence - narrowly escapes a bomb sent through the mail. The resulting public uproar forces the authorities&#x27; hands, and a warrant is issued for Padgitt&#x27;s arrest. Against expectations, Padgitt surrenders to police. During his bail hearing, however, Padgitt is shot and killed by Hooten, who is hiding in the ceiling. Hooten barricades himself in the courthouse tower and, after a short standoff, commits suicide. It is revealed that Padgitt - though guilty of his original crime - was innocent of the murders. Willie discovers that Hooten has indeed been involved with Rhoda Kassellaw, and sought revenge against Padgitt and the three jurors who voted against his death sentence.

A big newspaper chain, extending operations throughout the South, becomes interested in purchasing the &quot;Times&quot;. Willie sells the paper for $1.5 million, but his satisfaction is marred when Callie dies of a heart attack. The book ends with Willie writing her obituary.

<text>The British Gazette was a short-lived British state newspaper published by the government during the General Strike of 1926.

One of the first groups of workers called out by the Trades Union Congress when the general strike began on 3 May were the printers, and consequently most newspapers appeared only in truncated form. In order to propagate the government&#x27;s point of view His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office decided to produce an official publication printed on the presses of the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies. Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill, a former journalist, was appointed the paper&#x27;s editor and wrote much of its material.

The &quot;Gazette&quot; first appeared on the morning of 5 May. It was highly condemnatory of the strike and was open that it had no editorial independence. The TUC produced its own newspaper, the &quot;British Worker&quot; (subtitled &quot;Official Strike News Edition&quot;), however they were unable to match the government&#x27;s ability to produce and distribute the &quot;Gazette&quot;, with the &quot;Gazette&quot; circulation rising as high as 2,000,000. From issue 4, the masthead contained the invitation &quot;Please pass on this copy or display it&quot;. The &quot;Gazette&quot; ran to only eight editions before the strike collapsed; the last edition, on 13 May 1926, had the headline &quot;General Strike Off&quot;.

On 7 July 1926, at the end of a debate in Parliament on whether to grant the money to pay for the &quot;British Gazette&quot;, Churchill responded to Labour MP A. A. Purcell&#x27;s speculation about what would happen in future general strikes with the words &quot;Make your minds perfectly clear that if ever you let loose upon us again a general strike, we will loose upon you (pause) another &quot;British Gazette&quot;!&quot; The statement drew laughter and applause from both sides and defused some of the lingering political tension in the debate.

<text>Čoček (; Serbian and , &quot;čoček&quot;; ; Romanian: sistemul) is a musical genre and dance that emerged in the Balkans during the early 19th century. It features prominently in the repertoire of many Romani brass bands. 

Čoček originated from Ottoman military bands, which at that time were scattered across the region, mostly throughout Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania. That led to the eventual segmentation and wide range of ethnic sub-styles in čoček. Čoček was handed down through the generations, preserved mostly by Roma minorities, and was largely practiced at village weddings and banquets.

Čoček is especially popular among the Muslim Roma and Albanian populations of Kosovo, South Serbia and Macedonia. When Tanec first came to America in 1956, they performed čoček as a Muslim woman&#x27;s dance, &quot;Kjupurlika&quot; from Titov Veles.

The kyuchek, as a common musical form in the Balkans (primarily Bulgaria and Macedonia), is typically a dance with a time signature; two variant forms have the beats divided 2-2-2-3 and 2-2-3-2. (This latter meter is sometimes referred to as &quot;gypsy 9&quot;.) Roma musicians living in areas of the former Yugoslavia have broadened the form to include variations in and .

In the international folk dance community, čoček is danced to many melodies. Dances in the čoček genre include Jeni Jol and Sa Sa.

Jazz composer and musician Dave Brubeck was influenced by čoček-type tempos. For example, &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot;, from the &quot;Time Out&quot; album, was written following a and pattern.

<text>Dysart ( ; (IPA:[ˈtʲiːʃəɾʃt̪])) is a town and former royal burgh located on the south-east coast between Kirkcaldy and West Wemyss in Fife, Scotland. Dysart was once part of a wider estate owned by the St Clair or Sinclair family. They were responsible for gaining burgh of barony status for the town towards the end of the 15th century.

The first record of the town was made in the early 13th century, its initial role being to settle civil matters between the church and landowners. During the middle of the 15th century, trade with the Low Countries began for salt and coal exportation. In the 16th and 17th centuries, trade expanded to the Baltic Countries. Dysart acquired two nicknames: &quot;Salt Burgh&quot; and &quot;Little Holland&quot; as a result.

Following the sudden decline of the town&#x27;s harbour caused by the closure of the Lady Blanche Pit, the town was amalgamated into the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy under an act of parliament in 1930. Urban clearance during the 1950s and 1960s saw large parts of the historic town demolished for new housing. Demand from the town&#x27;s residents meant that part of the historic town — most notably the 16th-century and the 18th-century houses of Pan Ha&#x27; opposite the harbour — were salvaged and preserved for future generations.

== History ==
The name of the town derives from the Scottish Gaelic, &quot;dìseart&quot;, meaning &quot;a hermitage or religious retreat&quot;, which itself was a loan-word from the Latin, &quot;desertum&quot;, meaning &quot;a desert or deserted place&quot;. This is most likely linked to Saint Serf, who lived as a hermit in a cave in the area in the 8th century.

Prior to the 16th century, little is known about the history of the town. The earliest record of the town&#x27;s existence is a document about a papal decision between Dysart Kirk and Dunfermline Abbey in 1220. Another record followed in 1245, this time about the reconsecration of Dysart Kirk undertaken by David de Bernham of St Andrews. The initial role of the town, like many communities in Scotland, was to serve the church and landowners by resolving civic matters and dealing individually with property issues.

The first port has been said to date as far back as 1450. This helped the export of coal and salt with the town&#x27;s trading partner, the Low Countries. A man-made harbour was eventually built, but could only be used at low tide with limited space. The damage caused by the jetty which was commonly known as the &quot;east haven of Dysart&quot; temporarily cut short the function of the east pier in the mid-17th century. The harbour was later extensively rebuilt in 1829-31 with the assistance of Robert Stephenson, to include an inner basin with a nearby quarry at the harbour head and an extension of the east pier which would be raised and pointed southwards.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the town went through hard times with many residents, particularly skippers, being killed in the wars of covenanting (1644–1645) and the five-year occupation of Oliver Cromwell between 1651 and 1656. However, the salt trade prospered between the town and its two trading partners – Netherlands and the Baltic Countries with production thriving between 1570 and 1630. Subsequently, the town was given two nicknames: &quot;salt burgh&quot; (for the salt industry keeping the fish fresh for export) and later &quot;Little Holland&quot; (for the Dutch influence in Dysart&#x27;s buildings inspired by the shipowners who went there). The first coal pit in the town - known as Lady Blanche - opened towards the end of the 16th century. Two new pits – Frances and Randolph – would follow by the middle of the 17th century as coal began to succeed in the salt trade. Meanwhile, the harbour was revived with the imports of wine and spirits being sent to other harbours at Leith, Dundee and Perth. The town&#x27;s prosperity declined in the late 17th century and by 1715 the disrepair of the harbour was noted. Food shortages resulting from the export trade led to the town becoming a centre of the 1720 food riots, with estimates of 1,000 to 2,000 protestors on the streets and troops being overpowered and disarmed.

In the 1920s, the owners of the harbour, the Earl of Rossyln&#x27;s Coal Company, put pressure on the town council to deepen the harbour for use of larger ships. The council was plunged into financial ruin after the coal company refused to pay for the work in excess of £500. Many ships went instead to Buckhaven and Methil, where they received a quicker turnaround than in Dysart. The closure of the uneconomic Lady Blanche Pit in 1929, proved to be the end of the town&#x27;s coal trade from the harbour. The lack of revenue from Dysart&#x27;s harbour forced the town to merge with Kirkcaldy under a local act of Parliament, the Kirkcaldy Corporation Order Confirmation Act 1930 (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. xciii).

Dysart Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1897. The club and course closed at the time of WW2.

Today, Dysart is considered to be a north-eastern suburb of Kirkcaldy and the village forms one of 48 conservation areas in Fife. Important landmarks in the village include the Dutch influenced houses on Pan Ha&#x27;; the six-storey St Serf&#x27;s Church Tower; Dysart Tolbooth and the Francis Collery gearhead which is situated on the northern boundaries. An £11 million pound scheme has been started by The Townscape Heritage Initiative (THI) and Conservation Area Grants Scheme (CARS) to regenerate Dysart over a period of five years, due to be completed in 2014. This will include repairing historic buildings and structures such as Dysart Tolbooth and Dysart Harbour as well as providing new housing and meeting environmental needs.

==Church==

The pre-Reformation church in Dysart was dedicated to St Serf and was close to St Serf&#x27;s Cave where he supposedly lived as a hermit. It was under command of the Collegiate Church of St Mary in St Andrews. A replacement church was built in 1802.

A second Free Church was built in 1874 designed by Campbell Douglas.

Parish ministers: Robert Danielston (1560–1565); Andrew Forester (1565–1574); George Scott (1574–1582); John Young (1582–1584); Thomas Wood (1584); William Murray (1584–1616); William Nairn (1616–1630); James Wilson (1643–1661); John Robertson (1661–62); John Anderson of Balram (1663–1707); David Pitcairn (1708–1757); Patrick Muirhead DD (1757–1807); his son George Muirhead (1807–1816); Peter Brotherston (1816–1828); David Murray (1828–1850); William Muir (1850–1864); James Simpson (1865–1901) blind; John Waugh Gibson, second charge (1865–1906); Hugh Menzies (1907–?).

== Governance ==

The Sinclair or St Clair family have held the position of feudal superiors or barons of the burgh of the estate of Dysart since 1407. 
They were responsible for gaining Burgh of barony status towards the end of the 15th century. Royal burgh status in the town has long been disputed. A main reason for this being the area was a commercial background. A missing charter was only confirmed in a charter granted by James VI in 1587. However the title was indeed granted to Dysart in 1594 with the honour of having a seat in the parliament. A dispute between the St Clair family and the town inhabitants about the right to use the moorland resources was referred to the Convention of Royal Burghs in 1694 and was resolved only in 1718.

Originally St Serf&#x27;s Church was the meeting place of the town council, until this moved to Dysart Town House in 1877. The provost and town council met at this location once a week right up to the time of the loss of royal burgh status, when the town was amalgamated into Kirkcaldy in 1930.
The town&#x27;s former coat of arms was represented by an oak tree. This stood for the memory of the three trees planted in Dysart wood for the three Sinclair brothers. According to the tale, one night in the woods, the brothers were robbed and then killed each other. The site of Dysart Wood is most probably Ravenscraig Park.

== Landmarks ==

The whole of Dysart is a conservation area. This was designated by the former Kirkcaldy District Council (KDC) on 8 May 1978. Dysart Tolbooth on the High Street, erected in 1576, is the centrepiece of Dysart&#x27;s historic buildings. This was once used as a public weigh-in and measures house; guards house and eventually a prison built as an extension in 1617. The building was also known to keep explosives. When this was occupied by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops in 1651, one of them accidentally dropped a match into a barrel of gunpowder (which was abandoned by a Dysart merchant) causing the roof to be blown apart. The upper part of the building was rebuilt between 1733 and 1734 with an ashlar bell-chamber and a stone ogile roof. The neighbouring Dysart Town Hall was once used as the meeting place for the provost and town council.
Other significant landmarks in the town include the 16th and 18th century painted dwellings on Pan Ha&#x27;; the six-storey St Serf&#x27;s church tower and the harbour. Pan Ha&#x27;, or to give the full title, Pan Haugh, means low-lying ground of the salt pans - hence the expression, &quot;to carry saut to Dysart&quot;. Many of the houses have been restored by the National Trust for Scotland between 1968 and 1969 under the &quot;little houses scheme&quot;. During the restoration of the former &quot;Bay Horse Inn&quot; at Pan Ha&#x27;, once the residence of a son of Lord Sinclair, two renaissance painted ceilings were discovered and are still retained by Historic Scotland. The Duke of Holstein visited the Sinclair house in 1598.

St Serf&#x27;s church tower on Shore Road dates from around 1500, is considered to be one of Scotland&#x27;s finest examples of a battlemented church tower. This is the only remaining part of St Serf&#x27;s Church, which was abandoned in 1802 and largely cleared away for the building of Shore Road in 1807.

The red headgear of the Francis Colliery is a landmark marking the northern boundaries of the town.

Dysart House, formerly the seat of the Earl of Rossyln, overlooks the harbour. The earliest section of the house is the south range built for General James St Clair between 1755 and 1756, for which it is believed that the Adam Brothers provided the chimney pieces and the design. The house was extended between 1808 and 1814 to include new rear wings. The three-storey harbourmaster&#x27;s house in the grounds of the harbour dates from around 1840. Originally known as the shore house, this was used to store cargo from incoming ships, before being used by the harbourmaster. Today, the house is home to the headquarters of the Fife Countryside and Coast Trust and also has a bistro, shop and provides internet access.

<text>Escom AG (stylized in uppercase; previously Schmitt Computer Systems) was a German computer company, best known in Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States as the successful purchaser of Commodore International and the Amiga trademarks in 1995.

Escom was founded by Manfred Schmitt of Darmstadt, West Germany as the computer division of his music company in 1986. It became a separate company in 1991. In 1993, it became a publicly traded company, and it grew rapidly, controlling 11.2% of the market of German PCs by 1994.

During 1992 and 1993, a British operation was set up with a distribution and assembly base in Irvine, North Ayrshire and a small number of retail stores. These followed the model established in Germany, with small town centre shops which would customise PCs to order, rather than the out of town superstores and mail order businesses which dominated the market in the United Kingdom.

In February 1995, Escom&#x27;s retail presence on the high streets of the United Kingdom suddenly expanded massively, when it took over many branches of the Rumbelows electrical chain, which were being sold off by Rumbelows owner Thorn EMI. Also in April 1995, Escom bought Commodore International for US$14 million, primarily to get the Commodore and Amiga brand names.

Escom was one of two companies to bid for the Commodore and Amiga Brand names and assets. They won the bidding process against Dell and Creative Electronics International. Many other companies were involved in the buyout but did not bid such as Commodore UK and Samsung. It started using the Commodore name on computers sold in Europe, and established a separate division for Amiga related technologies.

The company grew too quickly, however, and lost 185 million German Mark that year. With no bailout from its shareholders, the company declared bankruptcy on 15 July 1996, and was liquidated. The Commodore trademarks were purchased the following year by Tulip Computers, while the remaining trademarks, together with the full set of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property, were acquired by Gateway 2000.

<text>Abacab is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Genesis, released on 18 September 1981 by Charisma Records. After their 1980 tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Duke&quot; (1980), the band took a break before they reconvened in 1981 to write and record a new album. &quot;Abacab&quot; is the first Genesis album recorded at The Farm, a recording studio bought by the group in Chiddingfold, Surrey. It marked the band&#x27;s development from their progressive roots into more accessible and pop-oriented songs, and their conscious decision to write songs unlike their previous albums.

&quot;Abacab&quot; enjoyed a mostly positive reception from critics and was a commercial success for the band, becoming their second No. 1 LP on the UK Albums Chart and their first to reach the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 7. Genesis released four singles from the album, the most successful being &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;No Reply at All&quot;. The album was certified gold in the UK and double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling two million copies in the US. The Abacab Tour visited North America and Europe in 1981, recordings from which formed most of their 1982 live album and concert video &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;. Three tracks left off the album were released on the EP &quot;3×3&quot;. The album was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2007.

==Background==
In June 1980, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford, with touring drummer Chester Thompson and guitarist and bassist Daryl Stuermer, wrapped their 1980 tour of the United Kingdom and North America in support of their tenth album, &quot;Duke&quot; (1980). Following a period of rest, in November 1980 the band bought Fisher Lane Farm, a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near Chiddingfold, Surrey, as their new private rehearsal and recording facility. In the process of remodelling the building into a studio, the trio reconvened in the farm house to write and rehearse new material, which initially took place in the living room, and they started recording the album in March 1981 once the studio was operational. &quot;Abacab&quot; marks the first Genesis album that was recorded in England since &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (1976). The success of Collins&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981) had gained momentum by the recording stage; Banks claimed it did little to alter the sound or style of &quot;Abacab&quot; or the relationship towards him or Rutherford as they had been friends for a long time.

==Recording==

Genesis recorded &quot;Abacab&quot; in 14 weeks, and they typically worked between 12 and 14 hours a day while making it. The new studio environment had a productive effect on the writing process and the band had enough material for a double album, but they discarded one hour of music because they considered the songs were too similar to their past albums. Though the band did not alter the way in which they approached the songwriting for &quot;Abacab&quot;, Banks said a conscious effort was made by the group to avoid &quot;Genesis cliches&quot; such as using tambourines during a chorus, reprises, extended solos, lengthy instrumental passages, and keeping melodies simple, which signalled further changes in their direction. Because of this, Banks considered &quot;Abacab&quot; to be the least technical Genesis album at the time of its release. Rutherford said the omission of songs that were too familiar to what they had done previously was required to avoid Genesis becoming a caricature of itself, and so the change in direction was therefore necessary. He picked the songwriting periods for &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Abacab&quot; as a &quot;rethink&quot; of Genesis&#x27; approach. Collins said the group adopted what they had done for &quot;Duke&quot; and took it further for &quot;Abacab&quot;, specifically with group improvisational jams and writing with the aid of electronics such as a drum machine. The home studio allowed the group to stop working on a track if a rehearsal failed to produce any desired results and switch to another, which was not possible at a professional facility due to the limited time available.

The band&#x27;s shift in direction was also underlined in their production with the departure of producer and engineer David Hentschel, who had worked with them since 1975. He was replaced by Hugh Padgham, who had worked with Collins on &quot;Face Value&quot; and former Genesis singer Peter Gabriel&#x27;s third solo album which featured Collins on drums. Gabriel&#x27;s track &quot;Intruder&quot; features a gated reverb effect on Collins&#x27;s drums that Banks and Rutherford liked, and wanted Padgham to do the same on &quot;Abacab&quot;. The album marked the first time Genesis produced an album on their own, with Padgham credited as engineer. The decision to bring the drums to the forefront of a song caused Banks to change his usual approach of writing and playing, which he found exciting. The band praised Padgham&#x27;s fresh approach to recording; Banks recalled the attractive ideas he had for recording drums and his lack of knowledge in handling keyboards gave Banks the freedom to explore and obtain sounds that interested him. The band considered &quot;Abacab&quot; an album that closely represented their natural live sound. The band would produce different mixes of finished songs and selected the one they all liked best.

==Songs==
&quot;Abacab&quot; is formed of nine tracks, six of which are group written with the remaining three solely credited to one of each member: &quot;Me and Sarah Jane&quot; is from Banks, &quot;Man on the Corner&quot; by Collins, and &quot;Like It or Not&quot; by Rutherford. The group decided to have the album consist mostly of collective songs as they thought such tracks became the strongest on &quot;Duke&quot;.

===Side one===
&quot;Abacab&quot; is titled after an early ordering of the sections of music the group had for the song, which at one point spelled &quot;ABACAB&quot;. Rutherford said that the final version of the track is not the &quot;ABACAB&quot; order at all, &quot;it&#x27;s like &#x27;Accaabbaac&#x27;.&quot; The song developed from a group jam session that had them playing along to a looped electronic drum track until the tape they were using to record on ran out.
&quot;No Reply At All&quot; is a rhythm and blues style track that features the Phenix Horns of the American band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. This marked the first instance of Genesis using outside musicians for one of their tracks since a string section was used on their debut album, &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot; (1969). The band wanted to emulate the brass keyboard sound that was used on some parts on &quot;Duke&quot;, and Collins had used the Phenix Horns on &quot;Face Value&quot; and suggested to Banks and Rutherford that they use them for the track. Collins thought the horns was a good move to &quot;suddenly jar people and take them off automatic pilot&quot; from the preconceived notions they had about Genesis. Their involvement created some initial reservations from Banks, but he grew to enjoy the track by the time it was complete. In rehearsal, Banks played a drum machine while Rutherford and Collins played a guitar and drum part, respectively; the band played until they found ideas and sequences that worked. Collins had the idea of writing a song that The Jackson 5 would have wanted to record, and directed the band in a direction that they had never gone in before. Collins wrote the lyrics.

&quot;Me And Sarah Jane&quot; originated from takes that the group had recorded as early as the second day of recording.

&quot;Keep It Dark&quot; tells the story of a man who gets abducted to a surreal and peaceful alien planet but does not tell anyone as he thinks no one would believe him. Its original working title was &quot;Odd&quot;, and became a favourite for Banks. It features the band taking two bars of a drum pattern previously recorded and playing the song on top of it.

===Side two===
&quot;Dodo&quot;/&quot;Lurker&quot; features lyrics written by Banks, who included a riddle in &quot;Lurker&quot;. In a 1997 interview, he said: &quot;There is no real solution [...] It was a bit of a joke [...] I honestly didn&#x27;t really have a specific idea in mind.&quot; Early arrangements of the song including two songs later released as b-sides - &quot;Naminanu&quot; and &quot;Submarine&quot; - suggest that perhaps &quot;submarines&quot; were a basis for the lyric.

Banks described &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; as a &quot;real one-off piece&quot;. Featuring drums, guitar, and a Prophet-5 analogue synthesiser, he obtained the track&#x27;s distorted keyboard sound by changing its presets as he played the notes. He pushed Collins and Rutherford to record what ideas he had for the track, to which Collins wrote a lyric. The band improvised on top of the track for 30 minutes, which was cut into a three-minute arrangement. Padgham wanted the drums on the track to sound loud and exciting, and not like typical drum recording sounds of the 1970s. Rutherford played the drums alongside Thompson during live performances of the song on the album&#x27;s tour. While the group were deciding the final track listing for &quot;Abacab&quot;, Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun believed &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; should be included. At one point, Genesis considered releasing &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; as a single.

===Additional songs===
Among the songs that were left off the album were three that were picked for release on Genesis&#x27;s second EP, &quot;3×3&quot;. This contained &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;You Might Recall&quot;, and &quot;Me and Virgil&quot;, which were included on the international edition of their third live album &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;, both released in 1982. Two other songs, &quot;Naminanu&quot; and &quot;Submarine&quot;, originally part of a four-song suite with &quot;Dodo&quot;/&quot;Lurker&quot;, were released as B-sides on the album&#x27;s singles.

==Artwork==

The cover was designed by English artist Bill Smith, who recalled that the group were difficult to work with as &quot;they only ever knew what they didn&#x27;t like&quot;. He first presented the band with portfolios from various illustrators, but the group did not find anything that they liked from them. Rutherford took Smith&#x27;s sketchbook and spotted an abstract design initially made for a book, which featured an arrangement of torn inch-long pieces of paper from a Pantone swatch of colours with squiggly black lines. The band chose it as the cover, and Smith reproduced it in four different colour schemes with an embossed finish. The band liked all four, and thought it would have an effective presentation on shop displays. Three of the designs had a limited print, after which their label Charisma Records selected the original montage to remain in stock. Smith recalled the difficulty in persuading Genesis manager Tony Smith and staff at Charisma that &quot;these tiny scraps of coloured paper&quot; was to be the album&#x27;s cover, but he was successful from having the group&#x27;s backing and noted it became &quot;his best paid job ever.&quot; Genesis allowed Smith to retain the copyright to his work. In a contrast to previous Genesis albums, the sleeve is absent of lyrics. Banks reasoned this would reduce the emphasis on the words, which he thought had been overdone on previous albums, in order to make them more of a part in the album&#x27;s overall sound.

==Release==
&quot;Abacab&quot; was released on 18 September 1981 in the United Kingdom by Charisma Records and 24 September 1981 in the United States by Atlantic Records. It was simultaneously released in four different colour schemes.

In 2007, &quot;Abacab&quot; was remastered with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus features as part of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set.

==Critical reception==
In a review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, reporter Paul Colbert thought the album was the band&#x27;s least consistent and therefore, least predictable in three years. He recognised a &quot;heavy PC [Phil Collins] twist to the sound&quot; on &quot;Man on the Corner&quot; and &quot;No Reply at All&quot;, but &quot;he does not have it all his own way&quot;. Colbert, however, thought Genesis had produced &quot;a couple of Frankensteins&quot; such as the latter half of &quot;Abacab&quot;, which he deemed &quot;unstructured&quot; and &quot;uninspired&quot; compared to their past instrumentals. He named &quot;Keep It Dark&quot; and &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; as &quot;the most exciting and innovative music&quot; the band had produced for several years, and concluded with the album is &quot;by far more promising&quot; than &quot;Duke&quot; or &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;. Ken Kubernik of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wondered if the success of Collins&#x27;s solo album &quot;Face Value&quot; was an influence on the group, to which he replied, &quot;Yes and no.&quot; He praised the album for its &quot;thick, resonant instrumental passages, quaint imagery in the lyrics, and superb production&quot;, but &quot;beneath the surface are some new wrinkles in the trademark Genesis sound&quot;, noting a reduction in harmonies for more simple vocals and Collins&#x27;s drum sound replacing Banks&#x27;s keyboards as their &quot;vortex&quot;. Kubernik did, however, praise Collins&#x27;s vocals.

Jim Bohen for &quot;Daily Record&quot; recognised &quot;Abacab&quot; had largely taken its direction from Collins&#x27;s &quot;Face Value&quot; with its structure based around a &quot;a huge, booming drum sound&quot;. He noted the instrumentation is less restrained than previous Genesis albums. &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; was described as &quot;an Ian Dury like tongue-twister&quot;, yet deemed &quot;Dodo/Lurker&quot;, &quot;Like It or Not&quot;, and &quot;Another Record&quot; as &quot;less noteworthy&quot;. Bohen concludes, however, that the album &quot;drags this trio of art-rockers into the 80s at last&quot;. A positive review was published in &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; by Pete Bishop. He named &quot;Abacab&quot; a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; album and picked &quot;Abacab&quot; and &quot;No Reply at All&quot; as particularly good tracks despite Collins&#x27;s vocals not being &quot;the world&#x27;s strongest&quot;. Bishop said &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; was the album&#x27;s only &quot;dud&quot;, yet believed overall the album would please Genesis fans. An uncredited review in &quot;The Coshocton Tribune&quot; in Ohio predicted the album would be Genesis&#x27;s first top ten album in the US due to its similarity to &quot;Face Value&quot;, but rated it ahead of &quot;the dreary &quot;Duke&quot;&quot;.

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album for shedding the &quot;ivory-tower artistry&quot; of their previous albums, turning to sparse arrangements and &quot;highly rhythmic interplay&quot; and drawing inspiration from popular contemporaries such as XTC and The Police. In his retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine echoed this sentiment with greater emphasis, declaring &quot;&quot;Duke&quot; showcased a new Genesis... but &quot;Abacab&quot; was where this new incarnation of the band came into its own.&quot; He also argued that although the album is far richer in pop hooks and accessibility than the band&#x27;s previous works, at its heart &quot;Abacab&quot; &quot;is truly modern art rock, their last album that could bear that tag comfortably.&quot;

==Tour==
Genesis toured &quot;Abacab&quot; with a European and North American tour between September and December 1981. The tour marked the first appearance of the Vari-Lite automated lighting system in which Genesis invested $1 million towards its development. Recordings from shows in New York City, Uniondale, New York, and Birmingham, England were included in the band&#x27;s third live album, &quot;Three Sides Live&quot;, and the same-titled concert video, both released in 1982.

<text>The Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America is a Franciscan complex at 14th and Quincy Streets in the Brookland neighborhood of Northeast Washington, D.C. Located on a hill called Mount Saint Sepulcher, and anchored by the Memorial Church of the Holy Sepulcher, it includes gardens, replicas of various shrines throughout Israel, a replica of the catacombs in Rome, an archive, a library, as well as bones of Saint Benignus of Armagh, brought from the Roman catacombs and originally in the cathedral of Narni, Italy.

== History ==

The Very Reverend Charles A. Vassani (1831–1896) established the U.S. Commissariat of the Holy Land in 1880, in New York City. It was from this location that Rev. Vassani and Father Godfrey Schilling, O.F.M. (1855–1934) began to plan to build a &quot;Holy Land in America&quot; and a Holy Sepulcher. They envisioned building on a high hill on Staten Island, overlooking the entrance to New York&#x27;s harbor. These plans were later dropped. Eventually the plans changed to a wooded hilltop in Brookland, Washington, D.C. In 1897, Fr. Godfrey purchased the McCeeney Estate in Brookland in order to found a monastery and church.

The six Brothers lived in the abandoned McCeeney house. After purchasing the site, Fr. Schilling visited the Holy Land and took measurements and photographs of the Holy Sites. In February 1898, ground was broken, and the cornerstone was laid on the Feast of St. Joseph.

Construction of the holy shrines, gardens, and Rosary Portico continued for several years. The Church was consecrated in September 1924, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of its dedication.

In January 1992, the &quot;Franciscan Monastery and Memorial Church of the Holy Land&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2022, the Archdiocese set the site as the sole designated location for Sunday celebration the Tridentine Mass within the city of Washington.

The Memorial Church of the Holy Sepulcher was designed by the architect Aristide Leonori. The cornerstone was laid in 1898 and construction completed in 1899. 
The church&#x27;s design alludes to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Its floor plan loosely resembles the fivefold Jerusalem cross. It was also built in the neo-Byzantine style, resembling Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. Some Romanesque influences were added to the design.

The Rosary Portico designed by John Joseph Earley surrounds the church. It contains fifteen chapels depicting the mysteries of the Rosary. Each chapel contains plaques bearing the Hail Mary in nearly two hundred ancient and modern languages. The Rosary Portico resembles the Cloister of St. John Lateran in Rome and Saint Paul&#x27;s Outside the Walls. Various Christian symbols from the catacombs decorate the facade.

Attached to the Church is the neo-Romanesque Monastery. The Monastery grounds contain replicas of shrines in the Holy Land, a Lourdes grotto, and a replica of the Porziuncola.

Many artists and architects have contributed to the development of the site.

== Library and Archives ==
The Library and Archives contain various materials on the Holy Land and the early development of the monastery, monastery life and a large collection of vestments.

== Music ==

=== Organ ===

A Lively-Fulcher organ was installed in 2003 which replaced the Henry Pilcher Sons Opus 1481. There are monthly recitals.

<doc id="1089708" wikidata="Q257411" url="?curid=1089708" title="Ethiopia national football team">
<text>The Ethiopia national football team (Amharic: የአትዮጵያ ብሔራዊ እግር ኳስ ቡድን), nicknamed Walia, after the Walia ibex, represents Ethiopia in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Ethiopian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Ethiopia. The team has been representing Ethiopia in regional, continental, and international competitions since its founding in 1943. The Walias play their home games at Addis Ababa Stadium located in the capital city of Addis Ababa. .

Ethiopia was one of only three teams (along with Egypt and Sudan) to participate in the inaugural Africa Cup of Nations in 1957. It won the competition in 1962, while it was also the host. However, success has been elusive since the end of the 1960s. Under coach Sewnet Bishaw, the team qualified for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations after a 31-year absence.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Ethiopia has a long football tradition and was among the pioneers of international competition in Africa, playing its first international match in 1947, defeating French Somaliland 5–0. The EFF joined FIFA in 1952, and was one of the founders of the Confederation of African Football in 1957. The team took part in the inaugural African Nations Cup in 1957, where it finished second. In 1959, Ethiopia entered the 1962 World Cup qualifiers for the first time and faced Israel in the second round after a bye. The team lost both games; and with an aggregate score of 2–4 was knocked out of the competition.

The team won the African tournament on home soil, in 1962. Nine countries entered the competition, including the reigning champions, the United Arab Republic, meaning for the first time a qualification tournament was required. As with previous tournaments, the finals only included four teams. The United Arab Republic, as holders, and Ethiopia as hosts, qualified automatically meaning each needed to play only one game to reach the final. Ethiopia won the tournament for the first time after extra time in the final against the United Arab Republic. Mengistu Worku and Badawi Abdel Fattah were joint top-scorers, both with three goals each, but the award itself was given to Worku because his team had won the title. This was the greatest feat ever achieved by the Ethiopian National team, and the only African Cup of Nations title it has ever won. Luciano Vassalo was the team&#x27;s captain, and the coach was Ydnekatchew Tessema.

In the 1963 African Cup of Nations, they finished fourth, after losing the third place battle against the United Arab Republic. The 1965 edition was even more of a disappointment for Ethiopia, as the national team was eliminated in group phase by Tunisia and Senegal, finishing at the bottom of the group, with only one scored goal.

The next African Cup of Nations was the 1968 edition. Again, but this time on home soil, the team finished in fourth place after losing to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the semi-finals, and losing the third place match to Ivory Coast 0−1. But two years later, the team went through a real disaster, as they finished at the bottom of the group phase, with a goal difference of 3–12. The worst was yet to come for Ethiopia as they did not qualify for the 1972 African Cup of Nations at all, losing to Kenya in the qualifying tournament with a 0–3 aggregate. Almost the same thing happened for the 1974 African Cup of Nations. This time, they were eliminated by Tanzania.

Ethiopia hosted the Nations Cup tournament in 1976, but failed to progress to the final four, finishing third in the group, behind Guinea and Egypt. In 1977, they played Mauritius in the qualifiers for the 1978 African Cup of Nations. After a 4–2 win on aggregate, they had to play Uganda. After a 0–0 draw from the first match, Uganda won the second match, 2–1, and progressed to the final tournament. They also missed the 1980 African Cup of Nations. Until 2013, Ethiopia last qualified for the tournament in 1982, under coach Mengistu Worku, legendary former player. They failed to make it past the group stage.

=== Later history (2000–2011) ===

==== Earlier success in CECAFA Cup (2001–2007) ====
In the 2001 CECAFA Cup, Ethiopia beat Zanzibar 5–0 and tied 1–1 with Rwanda B to advance to the quarterfinals against Burundi. After a 2–2 tie in regulation, they beat Burundi 5–4 in penalty kicks. Ethiopia went on to beat Rwanda A 1–0 in the semi-finals and Kenya 2–1 in the finals to win the championship for the first time since 1987. Because of their success in 2001 with Asrat Haile at the helm, Ethiopia jumped 17 spots in FIFA rankings from 155th to 138th. Despite their success, the EFF chose to replace Asrat with German coach Jochen Figge in August 2002.

In the 2002 CECAFA Cup, Ethiopia failed to qualify past the group stage of the competition; they lost all four of their games against Zanzibar, Uganda, Somalia, and Rwanda. In 2003 CECAFA Cup, Ethiopia withdrew just before the start of the tournament. The competition only had six participating countries with Burundi, Djibouti, Somalia, and Tanzania also choosing not to participate. The EFF fired Figge in May 2003, even though the team had won two games and was second in their group in the 2004 African Cup of Nations qualifiers. Then assistant coach, Asrat was appointed interim coach. Ethiopia failed to qualify by 3 points with a loss in the final game in Guinea. Asrat was soon replaced by Seyoum Kebede whose tenure with the &quot;Walias&quot; was also short lived.

The next challenge was the 2004 CECAFA Cup in Addis Ababa. There were 9 teams in regional tournament: Burundi, Zanzibar, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia. Ethiopia was led by captain Zewdu Bekele, and again by coach Asrat who was recalled to the position a mere two weeks before the beginning of the tournament. After defeating Burundi, tying with Rwanda and beating Tanzania, and Zanzibar, the team advanced to the semi-finals for the first time since 2001. Ethiopia advanced to the championship after a dramatic nail-biting penalty shootout with Kenya. The team went on to beat Burundi 3–0 and win the 2004 CECAFA Cup on 25 December 2004. That night, people all across Addis Ababa sang and danced in the streets.

The Ethiopian national team was the champion of the same CECAFA Cup competition again in 2005, in Kigali, Rwanda. This time coached by Sewnet Bishaw—after a 0–0 draw with Uganda and a 3–1 victory over Sudan—Ethiopia thrashed Djibouti in a 6–0 victory. They then went on to beat Somalia 3–1. Semi-finals saw Ethiopia whip Zanzibar 4–0, with Fikru Tefera scoring a hat-trick. In the final match, Andualem Negusse&#x27;s goal allowed Ethiopia to take the cup again with a 1–0 win over Rwanda.

The Ethiopian team did not fare as well in the next three appearances at the CECAFA Cup. At the 2006 CECAFA Cup in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia lost to Tanzania but beat Djibouti and Malawi in the group stage to advance to the quarterfinals against Zambia. They lost 0–1 with a very late goal by Zambia&#x27;s Jonas Sakuwaha in the 87th minute of the game. On 6 December, a CECAFA emergency committee made the extraordinary decision to have the match replayed because referee Issa Kagabi (Rwanda) supposedly had whistled the end of the match prematurely. Zambia announced they would refuse to play Ethiopia again. CECAFA secretary general Nicholas Musonye—not present at the emergency committee meeting—threatened that he&#x27;d cancel the entire tournament should match be replayed. Ethiopian Football Federation declined to have the match replayed and graciously withdrew from the tournament.

At 2007 CECAFA Cup, Ethiopia suffered a 1–3 loss to Zanzibar and a hard-fought 0–0 draw with Sudan in which they failed to produce a goal despite star Fikru Tefera&#x27;s call up. This was enough to eliminate Ethiopia from the tournament.

==== Suspension and reinstatement (2008–2009) ====

In the 2008 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, Ethiopia finished bottom of their group after losing their last two games.

In July 2008, a FIFA Emergency Committee decided to suspend the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFF) due to their failure to comply with the road map to normalize the federation agreed upon in February 2008 by FIFA, CAF and EFF. The road map was established in Feb 2008 following the dismissal of the country&#x27;s football federation president Ashebir Woldegiorgis by the countries authorities. One of the main points of the road map was the organization of an &quot;extraordinary general assembly&quot; to deal with the &quot;motion of dismissal&quot;. In addition, the EFF offices were to be handed over to the recognized leadership of the federation.

The suspension of the EFF came into force on 29 July 2008, the day on which the federation had officially been notified of its suspension. Ethiopia played four group level matches in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification before FIFA announced the immediate suspension of the Ethiopian Football Federation. On 12 September 2008, FIFA excluded the Ethiopian team from the 2010 World Cup qualifiers and the results of their matches were cancelled. Ethiopia&#x27;s exclusion from the World Cup also led to their exclusion from the Africa Cup of Nations. While it was not clear if the team was also explicitly excluded from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, their failure to complete the remaining fixtures effectively eliminated them from the tournament because the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification was also used to determine the qualification for 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. The team also missed the 2008 CECAFA Cup due to this suspension.

In July 2009, the EFF was reinstated after organizing the extraordinary general assembly and electing new leaders as instructed by FIFA. FIFA&#x27;s executive committee had voted a month before to lift the suspension so long as that EFF organized and chaired an elective general assembly. FIFA confirmed that it was satisfied with the election.

==== Continued troubles (2009–2011) ====

At the 2009 CECAFA Cup, Ethiopia defeated Djibouti 5–0, but lost 0–1 to Zambia and 0–2 to Kenya, thus finishing third in the group and getting eliminated from the regional tournament.

At the 2010 CECAFA Cup, in Tanzania, Ethiopia was in Group C with Uganda, Kenya and Malawi. After the 1–2 loss to Uganda, Ethiopia beat Kenya 2–1 and came to a 1–1 draw with Malawi. Next opponent was Zambia, and Ethiopia won 2–1 by two goals. In semi-finals however, they lost to Ivory Coast 0–1. In the third-place battle to follow, they lost 3–4 to Uganda to come in fourth place in the tournament. Tournament&#x27;s star players and goal scorers were Shimelis Bekele of Awassa City and Oumed Oukri of Defence Force. The team had exceeded fans’ expectations by reaching the semi-final stage.

In April 2011, the Ethiopian Football Federation fired national coach Iffy Onuora – just 9 months after he took charge of the Ethiopian national football team. Ethiopian Football Federation cited disciplinary grounds for his dismissal just a month after the team&#x27;s 4–0 defeat at the hands of the Nigerian Green Eagles in Group B of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification in Abuja. The Ethiopian national team had played 11 matches during coach Onuora&#x27;s tenure, winning 4, drawing in 1 and losing 6 matches. The team scored 12 goals and conceded 21 goals in those matches.

In May 2011, the EFF appointed former Zimbabwe and Namibia manager Tom Saintfiet as coach in place of Iffy Onuora. However, Tom Saintfiet left his job as Ethiopia&#x27;s national soccer coach after just five months, citing &quot;broken promises&quot; as the reason for his departure. Saintfiet had been in charge for three 2012 African Cup of Nations qualification matches, including a 2–2 draw with Nigeria that contributed to the Super Eagles missing out on 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.

=== Recent history (2012–present) ===

==== 2013 African Cup of Nations ====
In the qualification for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Ethiopia tied 1–1 with Benin after a goalless draw in the first leg at home to progress to the last round of qualification because of the away goals rule. In the last round of qualification, Ethiopia again won on the away goals rule after a 5–5 draw in aggregate score against Sudan. This qualified Ethiopia to the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in 31 years.

==== 2014 World Cup qualification ====

With a 5–0 aggregate victory over Somalia, Ethiopia joined South Africa, Botswana and Central African Republic (CAR) in Group A. Ethiopia drew 1–1 with South Africa away from home and beat CAR at home 2–0 to top the group after the first two games. They beat Botswana twice, 1–0 on 22 March 2013 at home in Addis Ababa and 2–1 on 7 June in Botswana. However, the 7 June win was later awarded to Botswana by a score of 3–0 after it was discovered that Ethiopia fielded an ineligible player. Still, they beat South Africa 2–1 at home on 16 June and secured Ethiopian advancement to the third round after beating CAR away in their final match, which was considered as a historic achievement for the country. The team eventually was eliminated by Nigeria with two defeats in the Third Round, though it remains as the best performance ever by Ethiopia in any World Cup qualification.

<text>The Icee Company (also known as Western Icee and Icee USA) is an American beverage company located in La Vergne, Tennessee, United States. Its flagship product is the Icee (stylized as ICEE), which is a frozen carbonated beverage available in fruit and soda flavors. Icee also produces other frozen beverages and Italian ice pops under the Icee and Slush Puppie brands. ICEE Bear, an animated polar bear, is the company&#x27;s mascot. 

The Icee Company was founded by Omar Knedlik, the inventor of the original Icee drink. It became the foundation for the Slurpee and other frozen machine drinks after several machines made by the company were purchased by 7-Eleven in 1965. It has been a division of J &amp; J Snack Foods since 1988 and distributes products in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Australia, the United Kingdom, China, and the Middle East.

== History ==

The Icee was invented in 1958 by Omar Knedlik, a Dairy Queen owner in Coffeyville, Kansas. The beverage was the result of faulty equipment in the Dairy Queen owned by Knedlik. His soda machine broke and he began placing bottles of soda in the freezer to keep them cold. Knedlik began selling bottles of the soda which would instantly turn to slush once opened. The frozen soda became popular with the customers of the establishment. 

The name Icee as well as the original company logo were developed by Ruth E. Taylor, a local artist and friend of Knedlik. She developed the name &quot;Icee&quot;, as well as the idea of the logo&#x27;s icicles hanging from the block letters, which has remained unchanged. She thought of the Polar Bear, but the actual bear mascot had already been created by the Norsworthy-Mercer ad agency. The &quot;Icee&quot; word with the snow on it was designed by a Mitchell Company staff artist, Lonnie Williams, as part of a cup he designed. 

Knedlik partnered with the John E Mitchell Company in Dallas to develop the machine, for which Knedlik received a patent in 1960. The first machine was made from a car air conditioning unit. It worked by combining freezing water, carbon dioxide, and a flavor mix. After five years, Knedlik&#x27;s idea had become the iconic Icee Machine after drawing the attention of 7-Eleven. The convenience store chain purchased several machines and later changed the product name to Slurpee based on the slurping sound people make when drinking the beverage. 

The Mitchell Company instituted a two-tiered franchise plan involving &quot;Developers&quot; and &quot;Subdevelopers&quot;. Essentially, the Developers and Subdevelopers both paid fees and rentals for the right to use specified numbers of Icee dispensers and for rights within exclusive territories to distribute the machines and to promote the sale of the Icee drink. By the mid-1960s, 300 Icee machines had been manufactured.

J &amp; J Snack Foods purchased The Icee Company in 1987. In December 2019, the company moved their headquarters from Ontario, California to La Vergne, Tennessee.

==Products and licensing==
===Drinks===
The Icee Company has over 75,000 Icee machines across America serving over 300 million Icee servings per year. Some American McDonald&#x27;s and Subway restaurants inside Walmart stores sell Icees. Burger King restaurants and Sam’s Club cafe locations in the US sell Icees and Icee Floats. In Mexico, Icee is widely available at department stores such as Walmart and inside movie theaters and convenience stores. Icee is also the primary frozen beverage sold in Wawa and Quick Chek, two convenience store chains in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. Icee is available at Valero gas stations co-branded with their Corner Store marts (except for independently owned stores) as well as at most Rainforest Café locations.

In 2019, Icee expanded into the United Kingdom for the first time, by partnering with Vimto, a UK-based international soft drinks manufacturer. A Europe-wide contract to supply the Cineworld cinema chain quickly followed. In late 2019 / early 2020 another European-wide contract to supply Showcase Cinemas further expanded the brand across Europe.

===Toys===
In January 2020, Moose Toys partnered up with Icee’s Slush Puppie brand to make 3 Special Edition Slush Puppie-themed Shopkins and Mini Packs for Season 13 (Real Littles Season 2) of the Shopkins franchise. The same 4 Shopkins were re-released for Season 14 (or Real Littles Season 3).

In 2021, it was revealed that Moose Toys again partnered up with Icee to make Shopkins and Mini Packs based on the main Icee line of drinks, which will be released in October 2021.

<text>Bottesford is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Melton in the ceremonial county of Leicestershire, England. It lies close to the borders of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.

==Location==
Bottesford is about east of Nottingham and north of Melton Mowbray and west of Grantham. The village is the largest in the Vale of Belvoir and near to Belvoir Castle, home to the Duke and Duchess of Rutland. It had a population of 3,587 at the 2011 census, estimated in 2018 at 3,382. It borders smaller parishes in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, such as Redmile, Sedgebrook, Orston and Elton on the Hill.

The local amenities include a post office, a railway station, a library, a church, a convenience store, three restaurants and three pubs: &quot;The Bull Inn&quot;, &quot;The Rutland Arms&quot;, and &quot;The Thatch&quot;.

==Name==
Bottesford derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Ford belonging to the botl&quot; (house). The ford was over the River Devon. Bottesford is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Botesford&quot;, in the hundred of Framland. Historically, Bottesford was closely associated with the Earls and Dukes of Rutland.

==History==

The village was built along the River Devon (pronounced Dee-von) and named after the ford at the centre of the village. St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, sometimes known as the &quot;Lady of the Vale&quot;, is a large medieval church at the centre of the village. Like many churches, this was built over centuries in mixed architectural styles. The lower part of the chancel dates from the 12th century with the remainder added over the next 300 years. The nave roof was finally completed in 1740. The octagonal crocketed spire is thought to be the tallest in the county at . There are two gargoyles on the south transept. A headstone to Thomas Parker and a table tomb in the churchyard are both Grade II listed, as are the gate piers and gates to the churchyard to the north. The church is the burial place of several earls of Rutland. One Rutland tomb is famous for an inscription that attributes a death to witchcraft by the Witches of Belvoir. Most of the church dates from the 15th century, but the chancel was rebuilt in the 17th century to accommodate the Rutland monuments. These fill the chancel and give a view of changing aristocratic taste in the 16th and 17th centuries. After the Manners family gained the dukedom of Rutland in 1703, it built a mausoleum in the grounds of Belvoir Castle, the family home, where all the dukes have been buried.

There is a local website covering many sides of Bottesford&#x27;s local history, including mounting evidence of occupation in Roman times and earlier. Bottesford was the venue of one of the country&#x27;s early friendly societies, thought to have been founded in the 1750s. It provided members with sickness and funeral benefits for over 200 years. Eleven contributors from the history group produced in 2009 a book on the local history since 1850.

From December 1941, there was a Second World War RAF Bomber Command airfield to the north near Long Bennington, called RAF Bottesford. Initially it hosted No. 3 Group RAF, then after serving USAAF&#x27;s IX Troop Carrier Command for D-Day, was used by No. 5 Group from late 1944. It is no longer used as an airfield, but the runways can still be seen.

Entertainers Laurel and Hardy stayed for Christmas 1952 at the &quot;Bull Inn&quot;, where the landlady was Stan Laurel&#x27;s sister Olga. They were appearing at the Empire Theatre in Nottingham at the time. There is a plaque recording this on the building.

There were two brickyards at Beckinthorpe in the 19th century, one also producing the unique Bottesford Blue pantiles to be seen on some local buildings. Local employment declined in the 20th century. The four pubs, six restaurants, at least 16 retailers and 20 odd small producers and service providers today are one-person or family concerns. Not so the earlier building firm of William Roberts Ltd. Joseph William Roberts (1917–2009) was born and bred in Sutton-cum-Granby, then schooled in Granby, Nottinghamshire and in Bottesford. He moved to the latter and started his firm in 1937, aged 20. It employed over 500 people at one time and branched out as a funeral undertaker.

==Character and appearance==
The village is somewhat unusual in Leicestershire. Its buildings reflect the traditions of neighbouring Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, as well as local influences, as local materials, initially locally quarried ironstone, but latterly local bricks and distinctive roofing tiles.

There are several open areas in the village, notably an area to the north-east of the churchyard, the churchyard itself, and an area of trees to the south of Devon Lane. Trees play a major part in the street scene in most of Bottesford.

The River Devon flows through the village, almost circling the church. Along its banks in the centre of the village, the soil is a pebbly material known locally as running sand. Views within the village tend to be intimate and enclosed, though the wider Grantham Road provides a slightly extended view out of the village towards Grantham.

Bottesford&#x27;s many listed buildings include the grade I listed 13th-century Church of St Mary the Virgin. There are two scheduled monuments within the village – Fleming&#x27;s Bridge and the stone cross in the Market Place. The stocks and whipping post are Grade II listed. One of the Grade II listed buildings, Providence Cottage in Rectory Lane, is dated 1723 in burnt bricks on the eastern elevation, where the initials REH set into wall. The roof is now pantiled, but the slope suggests it was thatched in times gone by. The Duke of Rutland&#x27;s Almshouse, also Grade II listed, was begun in 1590 and was a home for elderly local men called bedesmen (i. e. almoners), having once been a hospital. The building has two M-shaped roofs of differing pitches, both with concrete tiles dating from 1985. The Rectory, Grade II listed, is an ironstone and brick building dated 1708, enlarged in the 19th century and altered in 1988. It stands in Rectory Lane behind wrought iron gates, amid large, landscaped gardens, and has a slate roof. The police station, in Queen Street, is likewise Grade II listed and dates from 1846. It is in red brick with a slate roof and three bays. The central bay projects under a pediment and the building is an early example of a purpose-built police station. Market Street is the location of the Grade II listed Dr Fleming&#x27;s House, which was once a terrace of women&#x27;s almshouses built in ironstone and mainly rebuilt in brick in the late 18th century. A stone plaque over a door reads &quot;Dr. Fleming&#x27;s Hospital 1620&quot;. There are several Grade II listed properties in High Street, including the Thatched Restaurant, set back from the road in spacious grounds and the only remaining thatched building in the village.

There are many other listed buildings within the conservation area.

==Governance==
Bottesford is in the Melton borough of Leicestershire and in the Melton and Syston constituency. The current Member of Parliament is the Conservative Edward Argar.

The civil parish includes the villages of Bottesford, Easthorpe (directly adjacent to Bottesford), Muston and Normanton. The parish council has nine members.

==Transport==
The village is served by Bottesford railway station on the Nottingham, Grantham and Skegness line. There are also No. 24 and 26 buses, which run to Melton Mowbray at least every two hours, and other services to Grantham and Bingham.

The village was bypassed by the A52 road in February 1989 at a cost of £3 million at the time.

==Landmarks==

The Victory Commemoration (or VC) Hall is the local name for Bottesford Old Village Hall. The name came about because some of the funds used to buy up the original hall came from leftover money raised in the village during the Second World War to send parcels to those serving in the armed forces.

A new village hall was built in 2003, mainly funded by a grant from Awards for All (Lottery) and local contributions. To mark the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, several large developments in Bottesford include the creation of a memorial green. One of the 2010 Low Carbon Awards given by the Royal Institute of British Architects went to a house in Bottesford designed by architects Allan Mulcahy.

==Clubs and groups==
The clubs in the village include two for badminton, a bowling club, a cricket and social club, four football clubs, several sections of the Scout and Guides movement, and many other associations and events such as a youth club catering for 11 to 19-year-olds and a skate park. The village has several charity groups raising funds mainly to provide for new facilities locally. One group raising funds in Bottesford in particular is the Vale of Belvoir Lions.

Local community information has appeared since 2002 in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; newsletter, which is delivered free to every house.

==Education==
Bottesford has a playgroup and a primary school – Bottesford Primary School – and a secondary school – The Priory Belvoir Academy. The latter had its first group of year 10s in 2008, having expanded from being a middle school that year. This initially controversial change was hailed as a success after the schools inspectorate Ofsted rated Belvoir as Outstanding in its 2010 inspection report. It was rated Good in leadership, behaviour, teaching and achievement, and Outstanding in sixth-form provision in its most recent Ofsted report.

There is a public library in the Old School, Grantham Road.

==Places of worship==
There are Church of England churches in Bottesford (St Mary&#x27;s) and Muston (St John the Baptist). The poet George Crabbe (1754–1832) moved to Muston Rectory from Stathern in 1789, remaining as incumbent of Muston and of West Allington, Lincolnshire, until 1792. His &quot;Natural History of the Vale of Belvoir&quot; was a pioneering study of the district.

Bottesford Methodist Church in Devon Lane belongs to the Grantham and Vale of Belvoir Methodist Circuit. The Baptist Church is in Queen Street.

<doc id="1089717" wikidata="Q464218" url="?curid=1089717" title="Connie Smith">
<text>Connie Smith (born Constance June Meador; August 14, 1941) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Her contralto vocals have been described by music writers as significant and influential to the women of country music. A similarity has been noted between her vocal style and the stylings of country vocalist Patsy Cline. Other performers have cited Smith as influence on their own singing styles, which has been reflected in quotes and interviews over the years.

Discovered in 1963, Smith signed with RCA Victor Records the following year and remained with the label until 1973. Her debut single &quot;Once a Day&quot; was nominated at the Grammy Awards for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart in November 1964 and remained at the top position for eight weeks. In 1991, Trisha Yearwood&#x27;s debut single went to number one for two weeks, but Smith still held the record for the most number of weeks at number one by any female country artist in history. Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&quot; broke Smith&#x27;s 48 year record in 2012. Smith&#x27;s success continued through 1960s and mid 1970s with 19 more top-10 hits (including &quot;Then and Only Then&quot;; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Had No Lovin&#x27;&quot;; &quot;Cincinnati, Ohio&quot;; &quot;I Never Once Stopped Loving You&quot;; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love a Good Thing&quot;) on the country songs chart.

In the early 1970s, Smith began recording gospel music more frequently as she became more serious in her Christianity. As she focused more heavily on religion, Smith became known for her outspoken religious demeanor at concerts and music venues. At the same time, Smith spent more time raising her five children than focusing on music. She eventually went into semi-retirement in 1979 and returned to recording briefly in the mid-1980s with Epic Records. However, it was not until her collaboration with Marty Stuart in the 1990s that she returned permanently. Their musical friendship became romantic, leading to their marriage in 1997. The pairing led to &quot;Connie Smith&quot;, Smith&#x27;s first studio album in 20 years. Critically acclaimed, Smith began performing again and has recorded two more studio albums.

Smith has been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, including eight nominations for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. She has also been nominated for one Academy of Country Music award and three Country Music Association awards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included her on its list of the 100 greatest country music artists and &quot;CMT&quot; ranked her among the top 10 in its list of the 40 greatest women of country music. She has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry cast since 1965. In 2012, Smith was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Connie Smith was born Constance June Meador to parents Wilma and Hobart Meador in Elkhart, Indiana. Her parents were originally from West Virginia, and when Smith was five months old, the family returned there. They later moved to Dungannon, Ohio. Her biological father was an alcoholic, and he was abusive to Smith&#x27;s family. &quot;There were some tough times that I went through as a young child,&quot; she told an interviewer.

Her mother divorced her biological father when she was a child and remarried to Tom Clark. Smith&#x27;s stepfather brought eight children to the marriage, and Meador brought five (including Smith). The couple later had two more children together, totaling 15 children. Smith was influenced by music in her childhood. Her stepfather played mandolin, while her brother played fiddle, and her other brother played guitar. On Saturday nights, the family tuned into the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. She took up the guitar following a lawnmower accident, which nearly cut her leg off. While in the hospital recovering, she was given a guitar and learned how to play different chords. Smith did not perform publicly until high school when a friend invited her to sing Connie Francis&#x27;s pop hit &quot;My Happiness&quot;.

With only one-tenth of a point behind the valedictorian, Smith graduated from Salem-Liberty High School in 1959 as the class salutatorian. Following graduation, she worked as telephone operator in Lowell, Ohio. She also worked as a drugstore clerk, a dental assistant and in a grocery store. At age 19, she married her first husband, Jerry Smith. Smith&#x27;s husband encouraged her singing, and she began performing with more frequency. Her first professional performance was at the 1962 Washington County Fair. She then briefly joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Jamboree&quot;, a local country music television program. Smith was fired following her first performance, later theorizing it was because she was pregnant. She then successfully auditioned for and landed a spot on a similar program for WSAZ-TV.

Despite performance opportunities, Smith intended to remain a housewife and mother. In August 1963, Smith entered a talent contest at the Frontier Ranch country music park near Columbus, Ohio. Performing Jean Shepard&#x27;s &quot;I Thought of You&quot;, Smith won the talent contest and five silver dollars. Judging the contest was country singer-songwriter Bill Anderson, who was instantly impressed by her voice. &quot;At first I thought they were playing a record and she was lip sync&#x27;ing it,&quot; he later explained.

In January 1964, Smith ran into Anderson again at a country music package concert in Canton, Ohio. He invited her to perform with him on Ernest Tubb&#x27;s &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; program in Nashville, Tennessee. When Smith performed on the program in March 1964, she found out that she would not be performing with Anderson, but instead with Ernest Tubb. Impressed by her performance, Loretta Lynn introduced herself after the show and gave her career advice. After performing on the program, Smith returned to Nashville that May to record demos by Anderson that he planned on pitching to other country artists. Anderson&#x27;s manager Hubert Long brought the demo recording to the RCA Victor label where producer Chet Atkins heard it. Also impressed by her vocals, Atkins offered Smith a recording contract, and she signed on June 24, 1964.

==Career==
===1964–1967: &quot;Once a Day&quot; and peak success===

After signing Smith to RCA, Chet Atkins found himself too busy with other artists. Instead he enlisted Bob Ferguson to act as Smith&#x27;s producer. The pair developed a close professional relationship and Ferguson remained her producer until she departed from RCA. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better person to work with. He is one of the finest men I&#x27;ve ever known,&quot; Smith later said. Smith&#x27;s first session took place on July 16, 1964, where she recorded four songs. Three of these tracks were written by Bill Anderson, who agreed to write material for Smith. Two days later, Smith made her debut on the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. One of the four songs recorded on July 16 was &quot;Once a Day&quot;, which was chosen to be Smith&#x27;s debut single. &quot;Once a Day&quot; was released in August 1964 and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; Hot Country Singles chart on November 28. It remained at the number one position for eight weeks between late 1964 and early 1965. &quot;Once a Day&quot; became the first debut single by a female country artist to reach number one. For nearly 50 years the single held the record for the most weeks spent at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart by a female artist.

Smith started performing more regularly with &quot;Once a Day&quot;&#x27;s success. Bill Anderson briefly served as her manager, but was replaced by Charlie Lamb. Smith made her first network television appearance in October 1964 on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;. In March 1965, RCA Victor released her self-titled debut album It also reached the number one spot, spending a total of seven weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. Dan Cooper of &quot;Allmusic&quot; gave the disc a positive reception and described Smith as &quot;a down-home Streisand fronting The Lennon Sisters.&quot;

Bill Anderson fulfilled his promise to RCA Victor and continued writing Smith&#x27;s next single releases. Producer Bob Ferguson and steel guitar player Weldon Myrick created a &quot;high&quot; and &quot;punchy&quot; production that Ferguson thought would sound pleasing on car radios. &quot;I thought it was an awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular,&quot; Myrick recalled. In 1965, RCA issued Smith&#x27;s follow-up single written by Anderson titled &quot;Then and Only Then&quot;, which reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. It was followed by another Anderson-written top 10 single titled &quot;I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot;. In October 1965, the latter song appeared on &quot;Cute &#x27;n&#x27; Country&quot;, Smith&#x27;s second studio album. Although she disliked the name of the LP, it became her second disc to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. She had additional top five &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles through early 1966 with Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Nobody But a Fool (Would Love You)&quot; and Priscilla Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;If I Talk to Him&quot;. In 1965, Smith became a member of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; radio show.

In 1966, Ferguson felt pressured from RCA headquarters to market Smith&#x27;s sound toward &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; country pop material. Smith was against the pop production but nevertheless agreed to try it. The pair did several sessions featuring a string instrumentation. The style appeared on her next studio releases &quot;Born to Sing&quot; (1966) and &quot;Downtown Country&quot; (1967). Both albums featured full orchestras in the background and cover versions of singles by pop artists of the time. Featured on the LPs were the singles &quot;Ain&#x27;t Had No Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Hurtin&#x27;s All Over&quot;, which both reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top five. During this time, Smith appeared in several country music vehicle films, where she performed many of her current hit recordings. In 1966, she appeared in the films &quot;Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar&quot; and &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot;, the latter of which starred Jayne Mansfield. In 1967, she appeared in &quot;The Road to Nashville&quot; and &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;. Smith&#x27;s touring schedule also increased. In 1966, she formed her own touring band named the Sundowners and later married the band&#x27;s guitar player Jack Watkins.

In February 1967, RCA&#x27;s subsidiary budget label Camden released Smith&#x27;s next studio LP titled &quot;Connie in the Country&quot;. The LP included covers of popular country recordings of the era and &quot;Cry, Cry, Cry&quot;, a single by Smith that reached the top 20. In May 1967, RCA released an album of songs written solely by Bill Anderson titled &quot;Connie Smith Sings Bill Anderson&quot;. Smith later commented that &quot;it was an honor, not a favor&quot; to record an album of all Anderson tunes. It included covers of Anderson&#x27;s hits such as &quot;City Lights&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What It&#x27;s Like to Be Lonesome&quot;. Included on the album was &quot;Cincinnati, Ohio&quot;, which Smith released as a single and brought the song to the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top five. Its success later inspired the city of Cincinnati, Ohio to declare its own Connie Smith Day in June 1967. Smith remained at her commercial zenith through 1967 with a continued series of top 10 recordings. Her further hits included the &quot;I&#x27;ll Come Runnin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Burning a Hole in My Mind&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Back Again&quot; and &quot;Run Away Little Tears&quot;. Three of these recordings were included on Smith&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;I Love Charley Brown&quot;, which reached the country LPs top 20.

===1968–1972: Setbacks, gospel music and continued country music success===
By 1968, Smith had reached the height of her career. She was making multiple appearances on film and television while attempting to balance touring with a family life. The pressures of various responsibilities stressed Smith to a point where she nearly left her career. In 1968, she discovered Christianity, which brought solace to her personal and professional life. Ultimately, she chose to continue with her career and recorded for RCA every few months. However, she reduced her touring schedule. She devoted the remainder of her time to family life and made efforts to appear on more Christian music programs. She worked alongside ministers Billy Graham and Rex Humbard. She also appeared on several Christian television shows.
With Smith&#x27;s commitment to RCA, the label continued releasing new albums and singles with regularity. With her new religious convictions, Smith also made it a priority to include gospel recordings on her secular albums. This remained a theme throughout her career. In 1968 and 1969, RCA Victor released the studio LPs &quot;Sunshine and Rain&quot;, &quot;Back in Baby&#x27;s Arms&quot; and &quot;Connie&#x27;s Country&quot;. These recordings yielded a cover of Marty Robbins&#x27;s &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot;. Smith&#x27;s version reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart. In Canada, &quot;Ribbon of Darkness&quot; became her first song to top their &quot;RPM&quot; Country chart. Entering the 1970s, Smith made the top 10 of the North American country charts with less frequency, but continued having commercial success. The singles &quot;You and Your Sweet Love&quot; and &quot;I Never Once Stopped Loving You&quot; (both written by Bill Anderson) made the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top 10 in 1970. Her fifteenth studio LP of the same name was released in 1970 and made the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart.

During this period, Smith also teamed with country singer-songwriter Nat Stuckey to record two duet studio albums. The idea was crafted by Smith&#x27;s producer (Bob Ferguson) and Stuckey&#x27;s producer (Felton Jarvis). Both men thought the artists&#x27; voices would &quot;blend well&quot;. The duo&#x27;s first duet sessions produced a cover of Sonny James&#x27;s &quot;Young Love&quot;, which reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. Their first album of the same name featured covers of country and pop songs of the era. In an effort for Smith to record more gospel music, the duo cut a spiritual-themed LP in 1970 titled &quot;Sunday Morning with Nat Stuckey and Connie Smith&quot;. Christian radio programs often opened their shows with the duo&#x27;s gospel music, which influenced RCA to release &quot;If God Is Dead (Who&#x27;s That Living in My Soul)&quot; as a single in 1970. The song peaked in the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

Journalists and writers took notice of Smith&#x27;s RCA work following 1968. Biographer and writer Barry Mazor found that Smith&#x27;s recordings had &quot;a new delicacy of phrasing that shows itself&quot;. Mazor also found her albums to have more distinctive qualities, calling 1970s &quot;I Never Once Stopped Loving You&quot; to be &quot;one of her most consistent and strongest albums&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Smith&#x27;s recordings from 1968 to 1972, highlighting the strength of her vocals: &quot;She may have been given some of the best songs, but the thing is, she deserved them: few others could give them grace and soul, as this always entertaining box amply proves.&quot; Authors Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann commented that her later RCA singles &quot;stand the test of time as among the most powerful country female vocal performances of the 1970s.&quot;

In the early 1970s, Smith started recording more songs penned by Dallas Frazier. The pair had become close friends, which prompted Frazier to write songs for Smith that reflected situations in her personal life. Both Smith and Frazier described her 1970 single &quot;Where Is My Castle&quot; as being autobiographical of her recent marital troubles. &quot;Anybody knows that its cathartic to sing how you feel about things,&quot; Smith later said. &quot;Where Is My Castle&quot; reached the top 20 of both the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;RPM&quot; country singles charts. In 1971, RCA released Smith&#x27;s cover of Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Just One Time&quot;. Backed by a large rhythm section, the recording reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;RPM&quot; country charts, becoming her most commercially successful single of the 1970s. Her eighteenth studio LP of the same name reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and featured liner notes written by Loretta Lynn.

With Smith being among RCA&#x27;s top-selling recording artists, she had enough leverage to coax executives to let her record another gospel album. The result was 1971&#x27;s &quot;Come Along and Walk with Me&quot;. The studio album featured gospel tracks written by spiritual writers such as Dottie Rambo. In 1972, Smith had three back-to-back top singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart: &quot;Just for What I Am&quot;, &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Love (Let&#x27;s Leave It Alone)&quot; and &quot;Love Is the Look You&#x27;re Looking For&quot;. RCA released the singles on three separate LPs: &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Havin&#x27; Us a Good Time&quot; (1972), &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs&quot; (1972) and &quot;Love Is the Look You&#x27;re Looking For&quot; (1973). Her most commercially successful album was &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs&quot;, which reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. The studio project was recorded as a tribute to Dallas Frazier and featured 10 songs written by him. Frazier also sang several duets with Smith on the project. Before leaving her contract with RCA, the label released more LPs, including the compilation &quot;Dream Painter&quot; (1973). Its title track charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40.

===1973–1979: Record label switches, pop music incorporation and semi-retirement===
In 1973, RCA promised to give Smith a better royalty and more creative control if she renewed her contract. In an updated contract, these terms were not met. Upon hiring a lawyer, she left RCA and was offered a contract by Columbia Records. In 1973, Smith signed a new recording contract with Columbia Records. The label gave her more creative control, including the opportunity to record one gospel album per year. At Columbia, she met with Clive Davis, who agreed to produce her. However, the label dismissed Davis before they could work together. Instead, producer Billy Sherrill chose to work with Smith. However, a disagreement about religion ended the pairing before it began. She started recording alongside producer George Richey, who recently had success writing material for George Jones and Tammy Wynette.

At Columbia, Smith was pressured into recording with more pop production than before. &quot;From Day One at the new label, even more than before, it was a constant tussle, because I just am who I am,&quot; recalled Smith. However, she remained active in song selection and the recording process. Smith&#x27;s first Columbia LP titled &quot;A Lady Named Smith&quot; (1973) included pop production such as string instrumentation and overdubbed background vocals. The LP reached number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Richey agreed to release &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love a Good Thing&quot; as her first Columbia single. Instead, the Richey-Smith co-written song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Me (Right Where You Want Me)&quot; proved to be the first label single. The decision disappointed Smith enough that she chose to end their professional relationship. The last Richey-produced project was Smith&#x27;s first Columbia gospel LP, titled &quot;God Is Abundant&quot;. The album of religious material climbed to number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart.
Smith chose Ray Baker to serve as her next producer. Baker had operated a publishing company and produced several song demos that prompted Smith to choose him. The pair had a more agreeable relationship and recorded together throughout the decade. Baker produced Smith&#x27;s next Columbia album titled &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Love Goes&quot; (1974). The LP featured several original recordings and cover tunes. The album included &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love a Good Thing&quot;, which was released as a single and became her eighteenth top 10 song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Although she recorded two gospel projects in 1974, the label waited until 1975 to release both LPs. Instead, Columbia released a secular project titled &quot;I Never Knew (What That Song Meant Before)&quot; (1974). Its title track became a top 20 &quot;Billboard&quot; country single, peaking at number 13. It was followed in 1975 by the traditional country LP &quot;I Got a Lot of Hurtin&#x27; Done Today/I&#x27;ve Got My Baby On My Mind&quot;. Both &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Baby on My Mind&quot; and Smith&#x27;s cover of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Love Me&quot; reached the country top 20.

Music critics noticed a change in Smith&#x27;s vocals following her Columbia switch. When reviewing the compilation, &quot;Connie Smith Sings Her Hits&quot;, Thom Jurek of Allmusic commented that she lost the &quot;grain&quot; in her voice. Jurek went on to write &quot;It could be said, that regardless of the material, she never made a bad record; the tunes were carefully chosen it&#x27;s true, but she never tried to hide the hardcore twang in her vocal style.&quot; Smith&#x27;s biographer, Barry Mazor, found her voice to &quot;lower in range by this point&quot; and saw evidence of Columbia attempting to &quot;push her recorded vocal into the upper end of her range&quot;. Other critics noticed stylistic changes but observed no change in her singing. NPR&#x27;s Ken Tucker found her recordings in this era to feature more pop instrumentation but did not &quot;obscure the passion and pain she communicated so fearlessly&quot;.

In 1975, Columbia released both of her 1974 gospel projects. The first was &quot;Connie Smith Sings Hank Williams Gospel&quot;. For the album, Smith and Baker went through the Hank Williams catalog where they came across a series of never-before-released gospel songs. The result was the first album of Hank Williams gospel material recorded by another artist. In 1976, the project was nominated by the Grammy Awards for Best Gospel Performance. The second 1975 religious LP was the gospel influenced Christmas album titled &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. In 1976, Columbia issued two more country albums of Smith&#x27;s material: &quot;The Song We Fell in Love To&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Talk It Over Anymore&quot;. Both LPs peaked in the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums top 40. The albums included the number 13 country single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Talk It Over Anymore&quot; and her twentieth top 10, a remake of The Everly Brothers&#x27;s &quot;(Till) I Kissed You&quot;. The latter was Smith&#x27;s second single to top Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; country chart.

In 1977 Smith moved to Fred Foster&#x27;s Nashville label Monument Records. She was pressured into recording more country pop material than before and was given singing lessons by a songwriter. &quot;He [Fred Foster] wanted to mold me into something that I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with,&quot; Smith commented. &quot;That&#x27;s why that never worked.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine found her Monument music to have &quot;state-of-the-art production that dates instantly, walks the line between crossover pop and country-pop rather clumsly, and lacks good material.&quot; Monument released two LPs of Smith&#x27;s material between 1977 and 1978. Her only commercially successful Monument single was a cover of Andy Gibb&#x27;s &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot;. The single climbed to number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Yet, her other Monument releases reached progressively-lower positions on the country chart between 1978 and 1979. Furthermore, Smith had five children by this point and felt pressured to be at home with her family. Ultimately, Smith decided to leave her country music career entirely to focus on raising her children and tending to her religious needs.

===1983–present: Return to recording and performing===
For three years, Smith remained in semi-retirement, committing only to occasional performances at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, where she remained a member. At the Opry, she only performed gospel songs. However, she decided to return to her career in 1983. She re-signed with Monument Records, but left after the label filed for bankruptcy. Instead, singer and songwriter Ricky Skaggs helped her secure a new recording contract to Epic Records. The first single, &quot;A Far Cry from You&quot; (1985), was written by Alternative country artist Steve Earle. It reached number 71 on the Hot Country Songs chart.

One day in the mid-1990s, Smith was at her home talking to one of her daughters on the phone. After telling her mother what she was going to do that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn&#x27;t need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997) acting as the album&#x27;s main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. It consisted of ten tracks, nine of them co-written by both Smith and Stuart.

Smith&#x27;s 1998 project attracted limited commercial attention, but was given critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff, in the book &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot;, commented that the album sounded &quot;far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream&quot;. Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it &quot;a solid effort&quot; and commenting &quot;it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that&#x27;s come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn&#x27;t sell a copy, it&#x27;s a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn&#x27;t lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer.&quot; Also in 1998, Smith made a second cameo appearance in a film, portraying a &quot;Singer at the Rodeo Dance&quot; in &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot; starring Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup.
In August 2003, she released a gospel album with country artists Barbara Fairchild and Sharon White titled &quot;Love Never Fails&quot; on Daywind Records. In an interview with &quot;Country Stars Central&quot;, Smith said that she was ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but still enjoyed making the record. Produced by country and bluegrass performer Ricky Skaggs (White&#x27;s husband), the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and stated that &quot;Love Never Fails&quot; &quot;is probably too rowdy for most Southern gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won&#x27;t wow many country listeners, for folks who are fans any of these three singers, this is kind of a treat&quot;.

In November 2008, Smith joined the cast of Marty Stuart&#x27;s television series &quot;The Marty Stuart Show&quot;, which aired on the RFD-TV network every Saturday night. The thirty-minute program featured traditional country music performed by both Stuart and Smith, as well as radio personality Eddie Stubbs. The show stopped airing on RFD-TV in 2014. In August 2011, Smith released her first new solo recording in thirteen years, entitled &quot;Long Line of Heartaches&quot;, via Sugar Hill Records. The record was produced by Marty Stuart and included five songs written by the pair. Harlan Howard, Kostas, Johnny Russell, and Dallas Frazier also wrote tracks that were included on the disc. The album was reviewed positively by AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Leggett, who gave it four stars. &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be quite right to call this a throwback album, but it does sound like vintage traditional country given just a bit of a polished edge,&quot; he concluded. Andrew Mueller of &quot;BBC&quot; also gave it a positive response, calling it &quot;classic and classicist country songs&quot;.

In August 2021, Smith&#x27;s next studio album was released on the Fat Possum label titled &quot;The Cry of the Heart&quot;. It was the third project produced by Stuart and her first album of new material in ten years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;The Cry of the Heart&quot; as evoking traditional styles that &quot;recall Smith&#x27;s &#x27;60s era recordings&quot;. It was Smith&#x27;s first album since 1976 to reach a charting position on &quot;Billboard&quot;, peaking on the Current Album Sales chart following its release. &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album an 8/10 rating and concluded &quot;If you wanted to understand what traditional country is, you could go to the same place today as you could have 50 years ago: a Connie Smith record.&quot;

In April 2024, the Fat Possum label surprise-released Smith&#x27;s next studio project, &quot;Love, Prison, Wisdom and Heartaches&quot;. Although an album of covers, Smith herself did not describe it that way: &quot;I’m singing on behalf of my friends. Hoping to share them while passing along their songs.&quot;

==Personal life==

Smith has been married four times. In 1961, she married Jerry Smith, a ferro-analyst at the Inter-Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly, Ohio. They had one child together, born on 9 March 1963, named Darren Justin. (In the late 1970s, Darren went to Europe to become a missionary; he is currently a psychologist.) In the mid-1960s, the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band, Jack Watkins. They had a son before separating nearly a year after marrying. Shortly afterward, Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes. In the early 1970s, Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show. The couple had three daughters.

After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s, Smith stated that she never would marry again. However, on 8 July 1997, she married for the fourth time, this time to her producer, country artist Marty Stuart. Stuart began producing her after writing songs for Smith&#x27;s 1998 comeback album. Stuart described encountering Smith 26 years earlier, after attending her concert: &quot;I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown of Philadelphia, Mississippi, to work at a fair. She hasn&#x27;t changed a bit. She looked great then and she looks great now.&quot; Stuart said he told his mother then that he was going to marry Connie Smith. Smith explains how they have sustained their marriage : &quot;Make the Lord the center...and commit.&quot;

Smith revealed in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that she had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in February 2021. She was hospitalized, developing sepsis and pneumonia. She eventually made a full recovery. &quot;They asked me if my heart stopped, did I want to be revived, and I said, &#x27;Of course, I don&#x27;t want to be a COVID statistic,&#x27;&quot; she told the &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;.

==Musical styles and vocal ability==
Connie Smith&#x27;s sound is defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, primarily during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith&#x27;s sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith&#x27;s use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;prominent&quot;. Her steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called &quot;The Connie Smith Sound&quot;. In an interview with Colin Escott in his book &quot;Born to Sing&quot;, Myrick recalls how Smith&#x27;s producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound: &quot;He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls. I thought it was an awfully thin sound, but it wound up being very popular.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s vocal delivery has also been considered to be part of her musical style. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted in 2012 that Smith sings with a &quot;cool, authoritative ease, a skill that brought her to the attention of some of Nashville&#x27;s finest songwriters.&quot; Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann called her singing &quot;a pillar-of-fire delivery sobbed with desolation.&quot; Thom Jurek of AllMusic stated that Smith&#x27;s vocals offer &quot;sophisticated emotional delivery&quot; and that &quot;her control and phrasing remain a high-water mark today.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==

Smith is considered by many critics and historians to be one of country music&#x27;s more celebrated and respected artists. In his review of Smith&#x27;s 1996 compilation &quot;The Essential Connie Smith&quot;, Jurek explained why Smith&#x27;s vocals are usually compared to Cline&#x27;s, &quot;Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline&#x27;s throne. It&#x27;s not that there aren&#x27;t many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it.&quot;

Writers and journalists have also cited Smith as an integral piece of country music history. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann categorized her as one of country&#x27;s &quot;heroines of heartbreak&quot;, due to her emotional vocal delivery. Bufwack and Oermann further stated that along with Tammy Wynette, Smith was among the genre&#x27;s &quot;most towering country voices of the 1960s and 1970s&quot; who &quot;sang from the depths of despair&quot; and &quot;spoke for conservative Middle America in both music and life.&quot;

Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith&#x27;s albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended to record Smith&#x27;s version of &quot;The Wonders You Perform&quot;, but never got around to doing so. In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster, Dolly Parton famously said, &quot;You know, there&#x27;s really only three female singers in the world: Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, and Connie Smith. The rest of us are only pretending.&quot;

Smith has been given honors and achievements as part of her legacy. In 2002, she was ranked in the top ten on &quot;CMT&quot;&#x27;s televised special of the &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot;. In 2011, she was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. Alongside Garth Brooks, Smith was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2012. &quot;Just to be in the company of the great Kitty Wells is enough,&quot; she commented after hearing the news. In 2015, she celebrated 50 years as a member of the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcast. Her celebration was honored in a performance joined by Alison Krauss and Mel Tillis, among others. In 2017, she was ranked on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time&quot;.

In March 2021, Smith&#x27;s legacy was further cemented by the Library of Congress, which added &quot;Once a Day&quot; to the National Recording Registry. In April 2021, Smith&#x27;s husband, Marty Stuart, announced a documentary to be released about her life and career titled &quot;Connie: The Cry of the Heart&quot;. &quot;Studying the depth of what Marty and Connie have achieved in the industry and then discovering their ability to predict the business trends around their legacy makes me very excited to be part of what they are doing,&quot; said Nick Kontonicolas, who will help broadcast the documentary on his network.

<doc id="1089728" wikidata="Q2886428" url="?curid=1089728" title="Base Realignment and Closure">
<text>Base Realignment and Closure(BRAC) was a process by a United States federal government commission to increase the efficiency of the United States Department of Defense by coordinating the realignment and closure of military installations following the end of the Cold War. Over 350 installations have been closed in five BRAC rounds: 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, and 2005. These five BRAC rounds constitute a combined savings of $12 billion annually.

==Background==
The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, passed after the 1947 reorganization of the National Military Establishment, reduced the number of U.S. military bases, forts, posts, and stations. The subsequent 1950s buildup for the Cold War (e.g., during the Korean War) resulted in large numbers of new installations, such as the Permanent System radar stations and Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) control centers. By 1959, plans for even larger numbers of Cold War installations were canceled (e.g., DoD&#x27;s June 19, 1959, Continental Air Defense Program reduced the number of Super Combat Center underground nuclear bunkers to 7). In 1958, U.S. Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) began to replace Strategic Air Command bombers. From 1960 to 1964, the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations closed 574 U.S. military bases around the world, particularly after President John F. Kennedy was briefed after his inauguration that the missile gap was not a concern.

;1961 closures: On March 28, 1961, President Kennedy announced the closure of 73 military establishments.

;1964 closures: &quot;In December 1963, Secretary McNamara announced the closure of twenty-six DOD installations or activities in the CONUS&quot;.

;1965 closures: Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara announced 95 base closures/realignments in November 1964: 80 in the United States (33 states &amp; DC) and 15 overseas. Closures included the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, the Springfield Armory, six bomber bases, and 15 Air Defense Command radar stations—a realignment transferred Highlands Air Force Station to the adjacent Highlands Army Air Defense Site.

;1968 Project 693: Project 693 was established by Defense Secretary Clark Clifford during the Vietnam War for reducing programs and personnel, and the project also closed several military installations.

;1969 realignments: The DoD realigned 307 military bases beginning with an announcement in October 1969.

; 1973 closures: 224 closures were announced in 1973.

;1974 Project Concise: Project Concise eliminated most of the Project Nike missile locations which generally each had two sites, a radar station on an elevated landform for guidance and command/control, and a launch area that had launch rails and stored missiles and warheads. A 1976 follow-on program to Concise closed additional installations.

;1983 Grace Commission: The Grace Commission was President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Private Sector Survey&quot; on cost control that concluded that &quot;savings could be made in the military base structure&quot; and recommended establishing an independent commission to study the issue. Public Law 100–526 endorsed the review in October 1988 and authorized the &quot;special commission to recommend base realignments and closures&quot; to the Secretary of Defense and provided relief from NEPA provisions that had hindered the base closure process.

;1988 Carlucci Commission: On May 3, 1988, the Carlucci Commission was chartered by Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, which in December 1988 recommended closing five Air Force bases: Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois, George Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base and Norton Air Force Base in California, and Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire.

==Law==
The Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990 provided &quot;the basic framework for the transfer and disposal of military installations closed during the base realignment and closure (BRAC) process&quot;. The process was created in 1988 to reduce pork barrel politics with members of Congress that arise when facilities face activity reductions.

The most recent process began May 13, 2005, when Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld forwarded his recommendations for realignments and closures to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. The BRAC is an independent nine-member panel appointed by the President. This panel evaluated the list by taking testimony from interested parties and visiting affected bases. The BRAC Commission had the opportunity to add bases to the list and did so in a July 19, 2005, hearing. The Commission met its deadline of September 2005 to provide the evaluated list to the President, who approved the list with the condition that it could only be approved or disapproved in its entirety. On November 7, 2005, the approved list was then given to Congress, who had the opportunity to disapprove the entire list within 45 days by enacting a resolution of disapproval. This did not happen, and the BRAC Commission&#x27;s recommendations became final.

===2005===
The Pentagon released its proposed list for the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission on May 13, 2005 (a date given the moniker &quot;BRAC Friday,&quot; a pun on Black Friday). After an extensive series of public hearings, analysis of DoD-supplied supporting data, and solicitation of comments from the public, the list of recommendations was revised by the 9-member Defense Base Closure and Realignments Commission in two days of public markups and votes on individual recommendations (the proceedings were broadcast by C-SPAN and are available for review on the network&#x27;s website). The Commission submitted its revised list to the President on September 8, 2005. The President approved the list and notified Congress on September 15. The House of Representatives took up a joint resolution to disapprove the recommendations on October 26, but the resolution failed to pass. The recommendations were thereby enacted. The Secretary of Defense must implement the recommendations no later than September 15, 2011.

Major facilities slated for closure included:
* Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, renamed Brooks City-Base after San Antonio assumed control
* Defense Finance and Accounting Service, New York (removed from list 2005)
* Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota (removed from list August 26, 2005)
* Fort Gillem, Georgia

===2015===
The 2005 Commission recommended that Congress authorize another BRAC round in 2015 and every eight years thereafter. On May 10, 2012, the House Armed Services Committee rejected calls by the Pentagon for base closures outside of a 2015 round by a 44 to 18 vote. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had called for two rounds of base closures while at the same time arguing that the alternative of the sequester would be a &quot;meat-ax&quot; approach to cuts which would &quot;hollow out&quot; military forces.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 specifically prohibits authorization of future BRAC rounds.

In May 2014, it was attempted to fund another round of BRAC, although funding was not approved in a vote in May of that year.

In March 2015, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment addressed the possibility of a future BRAC, indicating that the DOD, Defense Secretary Ash Carter was requesting authority to conduct another BRAC.

In September 2015, at the tenth anniversary of the end of the most recent BRAC commission report, its former chairman Anthony Principi wrote, &quot;Now is the time to do what&#x27;s right for our men and women in uniform. Spending dollars on infrastructure that does not serve their needs is inexcusable.&quot;

==Appropriations==

<text>Aberchirder (, ) known locally as Foggieloan or Foggie, is a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, situated on the A97 road six miles west of Turriff.

== Etymology ==
The name Aberchirder, recorded in as &quot;Aberkerdour&quot; means &#x27;mouth of the Chirder&#x27;. It is formed from the Pictish word &quot;aber&quot; &#x27;river mouth&#x27; and the stream-name &quot;Chirder&quot; which is itself formed from the Gaelic words &quot;ciar&quot; &#x27;dark, brown&#x27; and &quot;dobhar&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;. This stream name is probably an adaptation of an earlier Pictish name.

== History ==
The village of Aberchirder was founded in 1764 by Alexander Gordon, the 5th Laird of Auchintoul. Until 1823 its official name was, in fact, Foggieloan after a small farm community on the site of which it was built. There is some uncertainty as to how the name Foggieloan originated. There are various theories; the most likely is that there is a stretch of moorland north of where the farm town existed (and, now, north of the village) which was named Foggieloan Moss from two Gaelic words (peat moss) and (meadow), so Foggieloan means peaty or boggy meadow. Kinnairdy Castle, now belonging to the Innes family is 2 miles to the south west, where the River Deveron joins the Auchintoul Burn. In 1823, the village is said to have been renamed &#x27;Aberchirder&#x27; by the landowner, John Morison MP (later the 6th Baron of Bognie and Mountblairy), after the 13th century Thanes of Aberkerdour of Kinnairdy Castle.

As a planned community, the village was built on a grid pattern around a central square and had a mix of single storey thatched, stone-built houses fronting onto the streets (to prevent people having their middens on show) with long gardens intended to provide the inhabitants with a seasonal supply of food. Alexander Gordon envisaged a thriving industrial village and built a small linen factory in Back Street (now North Street) which produced fine linen table-cloths and wincey using flax from Auchintoul Moss. By the late 19th century, wealthier inhabitants had built some grander houses and there was a selection of religious establishments throughout the town catering to various denominations in addition to the Church of Scotland and Free Church (1840, James Matthews) buildings.

In 1960, the Royal Observer Corps opened a small monitoring bunker, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack. It was closed in 1991 and remains intact.

== Transport ==
The town is served by the 301 service between Huntly and Macduff, and the 303 between Huntly and Turriff. The town was formerly served by the 308 to Inverurie. This service was withdrawn in 2021.

==Critical acclaim==

<text>Halesworth is a market town, civil parish and electoral ward in north-eastern Suffolk, England. The population stood at 4,726 in the 2011 Census. It lies south-west of Lowestoft, on a tributary of the River Blyth, upstream from Southwold. The town is served by Halesworth railway station on the Ipswich–Lowestoft East Suffolk Line. It is twinned with Bouchain in France and Eitorf in Germany. Nearby villages include Cratfield, Wissett, Chediston, Walpole, Blyford, Linstead Parva, Wenhaston, Thorington, Spexhall, Bramfield, Huntingfield, Cookley and Holton.

==History==
A Roman settlement, Halesworth has a medieval church; St Mary&#x27;s with Victorian additions and a variety of houses, from early timber-framed buildings to the remnants of Victorian prosperity. Former almshouses used to house the Halesworth &amp; District Museum (open from May to September) but this has now been moved to Halesworth railway station. There is a Town Trail walk.

The place-name &#x27;Halesworth&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Healesuurda&quot; and &quot;Halesuuorda&quot;. The name means &#x27;Hæle&#x27;s homestead&#x27;.

The town&#x27;s &quot;Angel Hotel&quot; dates from the 16th century.

Joseph Dalton Hooker, the botanist and traveller, lived in Halesworth with his family.
In 1862 the only murder of modern times was recorded. Ebenezer Tye (died 25 November 1862, aged 24) was a policeman who was trying to stop a burglary in Chediston Street. However he was beaten to death and is now buried in Halesworth Cemetery. The murderer, John Ducker, was caught and was the last person to be publicly hanged in Suffolk. The archives of the Diocese of Norwich record the murder of a chantry priest in Halesworth in medieval times.

In 1862 the Rifle Hall was presented to the town by the family of a late captain of the rifle corps, Andrew Johnston. It is so called because it was used as a drill hall by the rifle corps. The hall was originally built in 1792 as a theatre and was used from 1812 to 1844 by the theatre manager David Fisher. He owned an itinerant theatre group which travelled a circuit of theatres in East Anglia (including the Fisher Theatre in Bungay which has now been fully restored).

A Halesworth bank used to issue its own banknotes. A 5 guinea banknote (£5.25), issued by the Suffolk and Halesworth Bank in 1799, is to be found in the Coins and Medals Collection at the British Museum, and the Museum also holds later examples.

A short distance to the north-east of the town itself, in Holton, lies the Second World War airfield of RAF Halesworth. The airfield was constructed in 1942–1943, and initially the 56th Fighter Group of the United States 8th Army Air Force were stationed there. In 1944, it became the base of the 489th Bomb Group flying B24 Liberators. They played a part in the build-up and conduct of the D-Day, from 6 June 1944. From July they switched to strategic offensive bombing until November, when they ceased operations to return to America.

Between January and June 1945, the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron operated from the base, flying &quot;war-weary&quot; P47 and B17 aircraft. Their mission was to carry dinghies and smoke markers to aid downed crews found at sea. The airfield closed for flying in February 1946. Today it is an industrial site owned by Bernard Matthews Ltd, but there is a museum.

There are historical records of some 30 pubs in Halesworth.

==Governance==
Since 2019, Halesworth has been governed by East Suffolk district council and Suffolk County Council. Between 1974 and 2019 it was part of the Waveney district. Prior to 1974, local government functions had been carried out by Halesworth Urban District Council.

Halesworth Town Council was also formed in 1974. The 12 Town Councillors are elected every four years. The chairman and vice-chair are elected by fellow councillors and usually serve for two years in office.

==The Thoroughfare==
Excavations outside the &quot;White Hart&quot; pub in 1991 discovered part of a causeway – probably dating from the late Saxon period. A piece of oak pile from these excavations is in the Halesworth &amp; District Museum.

There are examples of 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th century buildings in the Thoroughfare. Number 8 is a former ironmonger&#x27;s. This shop belonged to the grandfather of Sir David Frost and the name of William Frost can still be seen underneath the archway next to the shop.

A block of four shops next to this was originally built in 1474 as the Guildhall. This was the home of the Guild of St John the Baptist and Guild of St Love and St Anthony.

==Arts and natural history==
Halesworth is the home to the New Cut Arts Centre. The town has the largest Millennium Green in the UK with around of grazing marsh providing a haven for wildlife close to the town centre. The rivers in this area are home to grey herons, common kingfishers and Eurasian otters.

==Railways==
Halesworth railway station is connected to Ipswich and Lowestoft. Services are available to Lowestoft and Ipswich and are run by Abellio Greater Anglia. Other dates of importance to rail travel are 1854, when the railway arrived in Halesworth, 1859, when the station moved to its present position as the line was extended to Lowestoft, 1888, when a moveable platform was installed. It was renewed in 1922 and restored in 1999, so allowing the platforms to be extended across the adjacent level crossing. In 1958, Norwich Road railway bridge opened as an alternative to that level crossing.

From 24 September 1879 until 11 April 1929 the narrow-gauge Southwold Railway connected Halesworth to Southwold. There were plans by the Southwold Railway Society to revive the railway, partly on the original track and partly on new formation, but these have now been abandoned in favour of a railway park, to be situated at Southwold.

==St Mary&#x27;s Church==
Halesworth is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, recording Ulf the priest to be in charge of the parish.

The present church is essentially early 15th century, with outer aisles built and restoration taking place in the late 19th century. At the time of the restoration, some evidence was uncovered of a round-tower church on the site. The carved Danestones in the church, depicting hands clutching foliage or tails, were found in the church during the 19th century and could be part of a cross shaft. Their original location is unknown, as is their date. However, Pevsner in &quot;The Buildings of England&quot; mentions them as being part of an Anglo-Saxon frieze, with a suggested date of the later 9th century.

St Mary&#x27;s became the centre of the eight-parish Halesworth Team Ministry in the 1980s. With the 1996 addition of the parishes of Bramfield, Thorington and Wenhaston, it is now part of the Blyth Valley Team Ministry of eleven parishes.

The statue of the Madonna and Child in the Lady Chapel was fashioned from driftwood by Peter Eugene Ball.
==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk on 95.5 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (The Beach) on 97.4 FM, and Kiss on 106.1 FM. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Beccles and Bungay Journal&quot; and &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;. 

==Sports==
Halesworth has a 27-hole golf club. Halesworth Town F.C. and Wenhaston United F.C. are the local football clubs. Halesworth also has a tennis club with courts and a bowls club, both located at the Dairy Hill area.

<doc id="1089754" wikidata="Q1010405" url="?curid=1089754" title="Aberlour">
<text>Aberlour () is a village in Moray, Scotland, south of Elgin on the road to Grantown. The Lour burn is a tributary of the River Spey, and it and the surrounding parish are both named Aberlour, but the name is more commonly used in reference to the village which straddles the stream and flanks the Spey – although the full name of the village is Charlestown of Aberlour.

== Etymology ==
Aberlour, recorded in 1226 as &quot;Aberlower&quot;, means &#x27;confluence of the Lour burn&#x27;. The first element is the Pictish word &quot;aber&quot; &#x27;river mouth, confluence&#x27;. The name of the Lour burn is from Gaelic &quot;labhar&quot; &#x27;loud, noisy&#x27;. This probably replaced an earlier Pictish cognate word. Charlestown refers to Charles Grant of Elchies.

==History==
A site noted as Abirlaur is shown in this location on maps in Joan Blaeu&#x27;s Atlas of Scotland, from 1654. The current village, Charlestown of Aberlour, was &quot;founded by Charles Grant of Elchies in 1812 – with the name of Charlestown of Aberlour after his son Charles.&quot; It is commonly referred to simply as Aberlour. A grant of land from Charles Grant senior feued 100 plots along the south bank of the river and saw the start of the High Street (formerly Main Street) and parish church. The three locations are close enough in definition for there to be little distinction between them. The village was granted its feu charter in 1814 and began to operate its own markets. Whisky was a major industry even then and once the 1823 Excise Act was passed and a longer warehousing process introduced it began to take on the more mature characteristics that are familiar today.

The first Aberlour distillery was established shortly after the Act became law, by the owner of a gentleman&#x27;s estate where Aberlour House is situated. Soon after the property changed hands, that distillery was demolished. In 1879, local resident James Fleming (1830-1895, built a new Aberlour distillery alongside the Lour Burn; which is now owned and operated by the Pernod Ricard group of companies. Fleming was also a bank agent and became a significant resident and generous benefactor in the village, providing its first purpose-built meeting place, The Fleming Hall (1889), followed by The Fleming Cottage Hospital (1900), and - as a safe pedestrian crossing over the fast-flowing river Spey - The Victoria Bridge, completed in 1902 and known locally as the Penny Bridge.

According to the 1846 &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland&quot;, &quot;This parish, formerly called Skirdustan, signifying, in the Gaelic tongue, &#x27;the division of Dustan&#x27;, its tutelary saint, derived its present name from its situation at the mouth of a noisy burn, which discharges itself into the river Spey.&quot;

Aberlour once was the site of an orphanage which was founded in 1875 by Margaret Macpherson Grant and a minister called Charles Jupp. His tomb lies in St Margaret&#x27;s Episcopal Church which was the church used by the children of the orphanage. The orphanage was split into two separate units – one for the girls and the other for the boys. Between the two buildings was the school where the children were taught. The horror author Dorothy K. Haynes and her twin brother Leonard spent four years, from 1929 to 1933, in Aberlour Orphanage; her experiences are recounted in her 1973 memoir &quot;Haste Ye Back&quot;. Aberlour Child Care Trust is now one of Scotland&#x27;s main children&#x27;s charities with services throughout Scotland. The Trust was also found to be a child care institution where children suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry in 2021.

Aberlour is also the place where the famous Walkers shortbread is made. Walkers own the woods behind the factory – Fisherton woods. Until 2004, Aberlour House was the site of a school, a prep school for Gordonstoun; it is now offices for Walkers. Aberlour Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared in 1905 and continued until the late 1930s.

Thomas Telford, the renowned civil engineer designed Craigellachie Bridge spanning the River Spey about to the north of the village. It was built after the Great Spate in the 19th century destroyed an earlier bridge.

Alexander Cameron Sim, a pharmacist who introduced lemonade (locally called ramune) to Japan, was born in the village.

The area was once served by Aberlour railway station, but this closed on 18 October 1965 as a result of the Beeching Axe.

==Notable residents==

*Rev James Sellar, minister of the parish church, was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1875.
*James Fleming, founder of Aberlour distillery in 1880; village bank agent; philanthropist.

<text>The Free West Alliance (FWA) was an organization attempting to organize the migration of libertarians and the like-minded into the U.S. states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, in order to influence local political policy toward libertarian ideals. It also sought to mobilize residents of the states who had libertarian politics.

==History==
FWA was created shortly after the selection of the state of New Hampshire by an earlier American political migration movement, the Free State Project (FSP). FWA founders were predominantly either former members of FSP who had &quot;opted out&quot; of New Hampshire in that organization&#x27;s state selection process, or others who had associated with FSP but not signed up.

The reasons for the creation of FWA are many, most prominent being the dissatisfaction many westerners felt over the selection of an eastern state, for geographical reasons and for the cultural split that became evident in the Free State Project discussion forums between &quot;westerners&quot; and &quot;easterners&quot;. Note, some in the &quot;western&quot; faction actually lived in the east, and vice versa.

The Free West Alliance was associated to some degree with similar Canadian movements, and with the Free State Wyoming (FSW).

The Montana and Wyoming branches of FWA were the most active. Evidence of prior, small freedom migration movements to Wyoming turned up in discussions on the various email lists associated with FWA. Montana and Wyoming are often viewed as states with strong anti-authoritarian traditions, and have a history of informal individual migrations for that purpose.

<text>Edward Wotton (1492 – 5 October 1555) was an English physician, born in Oxford, credited with starting the modern study of zoology, by separating out much of the fanciful and folkloric additions that had been added over time to the body of zoological knowledge.

His systematic researches on Aristotelian lines were collected in &quot;De differentiis animalium libri decem&quot;, published in Paris in 1552. Wotton was also partly responsible for &quot;Insectorum, sive, Minimorum animalium theatrum&quot; or &quot;Theatre of Insects&quot;, although this was not published (as edited by Thomas Muffet) until 1634.

By favour of bishop Fox, he was made &quot;socius compar&quot; of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, with leave to travel into Italy for three years. He attended Padua, applied himself to physic, and took the degree of doctor. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 8 February 1528. He does not appear, as often stated, to have been physician to Henry VIII, but did serve the Duke of Norfolk and Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury. He was a fellow censor with Alban Hill in 1555.

<text>Enford is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, in the northeast of Salisbury Plain. The village lies southeast of Devizes and north of Salisbury. The parish includes nine small settlements along both banks of the headwaters of the River Avon. Besides Enford, these are Compton, Coombe, East Chisenbury, Fifield, Littlecott, Longstreet, New Town and West Chisenbury.

The name is derived from the Old English &quot;Enedford&quot; meaning &#x27;duck ford&#x27;.

== History ==
The parish carries much evidence of prehistoric activity, including bowl barrows. Lidbury Camp, on Littlecott Down, was occupied in the Iron Age and in the Romano-British period, and further evidence of Romano-British occupation has been found around Compton. A site on the west bank of the Avon near Compton is possibly that of a Roman villa.

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded 34 households at Enford and a smaller settlement at Compton. Medieval strip lynchets are visible north of East Chisenbury.

Enford manor was held by St Swithun&#x27;s priory, Winchester until the Dissolution. Later owners included Thomas Culpeper (executed in 1541 for alleged adultery with Catherine Howard), and Sir Edmund Antrobus who in 1899 sold the manor to the War Office.

The parish population in 1676 has been calculated as 616. At the first census in 1841 there were 814; the population peaked at 911 in 1851 and then steadily declined to around 700 in the mid 20th century.

Chisenbury Priory is a country house, approached by a tree-lined drive from the road between Littecott and East Chisenbury. The house was built in the later 17th century, with a brick front added in the 18th; it is Grade II* listed.

A school was provided at Enford c. 1845 by Sir Edmund Antrobus, and supported partly by Sir Edmund and partly by a fund organised by John Prince, former vicar. By 1871 it had become a National School with some 61 pupils, increasing to 124 in 1906. The school moved to new buildings at Longstreet in 1966, next to the newly built village hall; it closed in 1989.

The parish gained a small area in 1885: West Chisenbury, formerly a detached part of Netheravon parish.

==Archaeology==
The East Chisenbury midden is a notable example of a large dump of archaeological material, dating to the 1st millennium BC. Now within a military training area, the midden mound contains discrete layers of flint, charcoal, bones, pottery and excrement. It survives to a height of and is wide despite 2,500 years of weathering. The accumulation is believed by some archaeologists to have a ritual basis, with organised deposition of produce and waste being suggested as an explanation for its size and longevity. All Cannings Cross, to the north, is a similar site.

== Religious sites ==
=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church, All Saints&#x27;, was described by Pevsner as &quot;Quite a large and a very interesting church. ... The chancel is astonishing.&quot;

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a priest at Enford. There may have been a church here at that time, as 12th-century arches are cut into earlier walls. The chancel arch is late 12th or early 13th, while the chancel is 13th except for its south wall. A small octagonal building on the north side, built as a chapel but now the sacristy, is from a similar date. The north aisle is 14th century; in the 15th the south aisle and the tower were rebuilt. There was a spire, which fell in 1817, requiring repairs to the church in 1825–30. Restoration by C.E. Ponting took place in 1892–3.

In the churchyard is the lower part of a medieval stone cross. The six bells in the tower include three from the 17th century.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1964. Today it is part of the Avon River Team parishes.

=== Methodist chapel ===
A chapel was built at East Chisenbury c. 1845 by either Primitive Methodists or Independent Methodists. A new chapel was built by the former in 1896 and continued in use well into the 20th century; the building was sold in 1990.

==Local government==
Enford is a civil parish in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant aspects of local government. It also has an elected parish council, with mostly consultative functions.

== Amenities ==
There is a modern village hall at Longstreet. The parish has two pubs: the &quot;Swan Inn&quot; at Enford (17th/18th century) and the &quot;Red Lion&quot; at East Chisenbury.

<doc id="1089769" wikidata="Q1209858" url="?curid=1089769" title="Dick Zimmer">
<text>Richard Alan Zimmer (born August 16, 1944) is an American Republican Party politician from New Jersey, who served in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature and in the United States House of Representatives. He was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey in 1996 and 2008. In March 2010, he was appointed by Governor Chris Christie to head the New Jersey Privatization Task Force.

==Early life and career==
Zimmer was born on August 16, 1944, in Newark, New Jersey, to William and Evelyn Zimmer, the second of two children. In his early years he was raised in Hillside, New Jersey. His father, a physician, died of a heart attack when he was 3 years old. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother moved from Hillside to Bloomfield, New Jersey, where she supported the family by working as a clerk at the Sunshine Biscuits warehouse. They lived in a Bloomfield garden apartment, which Zimmer has referred to as &quot;the New Jersey equivalent of a log cabin.&quot;

When Zimmer was 12 years old, his mother married Howard Rubin, a Korean War veteran with three children of his own. The newly combined family moved to Glen Ridge, New Jersey, and Rubin worked at the post office there. Zimmer attended Glen Ridge High School, where he was selected as the class speaker for his graduation ceremony. His mother, suffering from lymphoma, required paramedics to take her from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital to the school auditorium on a stretcher to hear the address. She died several days later.

Zimmer attended Yale University on a full academic scholarship and majored in political science, graduating in 1966. In the summer of 1965, he worked in the Washington, D.C., office of Republican U.S. Senator Clifford P. Case, after which time he became active in Republican politics.
He attended Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;.

== Career ==
After receiving his LL.B. in 1969 he worked as an attorney in New York and New Jersey for several years, first for Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore and then for Johnson &amp; Johnson.

In 1973, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board, a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy group and think tank with the mission to make political institutions more open and accountable. From 1974 to 1977, he served as chairman of New Jersey Common Cause. As chairman he successfully lobbied for New Jersey&#x27;s Sunshine Law, which made government meetings open to the public. He also championed campaign finance reform, working closely with Thomas Kean, then a member of the New Jersey General Assembly. Zimmer then served as treasurer for Kean&#x27;s reelection campaign.

===New Jersey Legislature===
After moving to Delaware Township in Hunterdon County, he was elected to the General Assembly in 1981, serving until 1987. He was the prime Assembly sponsor of New Jersey&#x27;s first farmland preservation law, resulting in the permanent preservation of 1,222 farms in the state. Zimmer also sponsored the legislation creating the state&#x27;s radon detection and remediation program, which became a national model. He was chairman of the Assembly State Government Committee from 1986 to 1987.

In 1987, following the death of State Senator Walter E. Foran, Zimmer won a special election to replace him in the New Jersey Senate. He was later elected to a full term. In the Senate he served on the Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee.

===U.S. House of Representatives===

In 1990, Zimmer ran for the United States House of Representatives for the 12th District, then encompassing parts of Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Morris and Warren counties. The seat was open after six-term incumbent Jim Courter decided to not seek reelection after unsuccessfully running for Governor of New Jersey the previous year. In the Republican primary, Zimmer defeated Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, the early favorite, and Phil McConkey, former wide receiver for the New York Giants. In the general election he defeated Marguerite Chandler, a businesswoman from Somerset County, by a margin of 66 to 34 percent.

Zimmer served three terms in the House, winning reelection in 1992 and 1994. As a Congressman, Zimmer is best known for writing Megan&#x27;s Law (U.S. Public Law 104–145), which requires notification when a convicted sex offender moves into a residential area. It was named after Megan Kanka, a New Jersey resident who was raped and murdered by convicted sex offender Jesse Timmendequas. He also introduced &quot;no-frills&quot; prison legislation, requiring the elimination of luxurious prison conditions.

As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, he sought the elimination of wasteful spending and undue taxation. He was ranked the most fiscally conservative member of the United States Congress three times by the National Taxpayers Union and was designated a Taxpayer Hero by Citizens Against Government Waste every year he was in office.

Zimmer was also a member of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the Committee on Government Operations. As a member of the Environment Subcommittee, he introduced environmental risk-assessment legislation later incorporated in the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act.

===1996 U.S. Senate campaign===

In 1995, Zimmer lined up support to run in the following year&#x27;s United States Senate elections, becoming the front-runner among Republicans seeking to face Democratic incumbent Bill Bradley. On August 16, 1995, Bradley announced that he would not seek reelection. Zimmer formally announced his candidacy on February 13, 1996, having already secured the endorsement of Governor Christine Todd Whitman and other leading Republicans. In the Republican primary he won with 68 percent of the vote, defeating Passaic County Freeholder Richard DuHaime (20 percent) and State Senator Dick LaRossa (12 percent).

After a bitter and expensive campaign that focused partly on Zimmer&#x27;s authorship of the federal version of Megan&#x27;s Law, Zimmer lost to Democratic Congressman Robert Torricelli by a vote of 1,519,328 (53 percent) to 1,227,817 (43 percent).

===Career after Congress===
Zimmer gave up his House seat to run for the Senate, completing his third term in office on January 3, 1997. After leaving Congress, he worked at the Princeton office of the Philadelphia-based law firm Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads. In 2001 he joined the Washington, D.C., office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, where he is of counsel.

From 1997 to 2000 Zimmer also taught as a lecturer in Public and International Affairs at Princeton University&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson School.

In 2000, Zimmer again ran for the 12th District House seat. In the Republican primary he defeated Michael J. Pappas, who had held the seat from 1997 to 1999, by a margin of 62 to 38 percent. He faced the incumbent, Democrat Rush D. Holt, Jr., in the general election. The results were too close to call on election night, and after a recount Zimmer ultimately lost by only 651 votes (146,162 to 145,511 votes, or 48.7 to 48.5 percent).

On March 11, 2010, Zimmer was appointed by Governor Chris Christie to be the chairman of the New Jersey Privatization Task Force, charged with developing plans to privatize certain state government operations as a cost-cutting measure.

On September 25, 2020, he endorsed Joe Biden for President.

In February 2021, Zimmer announced he was running for the New Jersey Senate, planning to face off with Pappas again in the primary. However, he dropped out later that month.

Zimmer and his wife Marfy Goodspeed are longtime residents of Delaware Township in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. They have two sons: Carl Zimmer, a science writer, and Benjamin Zimmer, a linguist and lexicographer.

====2008 U.S. Senate campaign====
Zimmer entered the race for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey on April 11, 2008, after being drafted by New Jersey Republican leaders. Party leaders had originally supported businesswoman Anne Evans Estabrook for the Senate nomination until she withdrew in March 2008, following a mini-stroke. Many Estabrook supporters then supported businessman Andy Unanue for the Senate nomination. Unanue received criticism in the race because of his residency in New York City and his spending his entire three-week campaign in Vail, Colorado. Several days after filing his petitions for the Senate race, Unanue dropped out of the race and his committee on vacancies designated Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions.

On June 3, 2008, Zimmer won the Republican U.S. Senate nomination over State Senator Joseph Pennacchio and Ramapo College economics professor Murray Sabrin. In the general election on November 4, 2008, he faced the Democratic primary winner, incumbent U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg.

In polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Strategic Vision in mid-September 2008, Zimmer trailed Lautenberg by 7 points. He ultimately lost to Lautenberg by a margin of 56% to 42%. Despite the loss, Zimmer received over 1.4 million votes, setting a record for most votes cast in New Jersey history for a Republican candidate for statewide office.

<text>Synovial fluid, also called synovia,[help 1] is a viscous, non-Newtonian fluid found in the cavities of synovial joints. With its egg white–like consistency, the principal role of synovial fluid is to reduce friction between the articular cartilage of synovial joints during movement. Synovial fluid is a small component of the transcellular fluid component of extracellular fluid.

==Structure==
The inner membrane of synovial joints is called the synovial membrane and secretes synovial fluid into the joints. Synovial fluid is an ultrafiltrate from blood, and contains proteins derived from the blood plasma and proteins that are
produced by cells within the joint tissues. The fluid contains hyaluronan secreted by fibroblast-like cells in the synovial membrane, lubricin (proteoglycan 4; PRG4) secreted by the surface chondrocytes of the cartilage and interstitial fluid filtered from the blood plasma. This fluid forms a thin layer (roughly 50 μm) at the surface of cartilage and also seeps into microcavities and irregularities in the articular cartilage surface, filling all empty space. The fluid in articular cartilage effectively serves as a synovial fluid reserve. During movement, the synovial fluid held in the cartilage is squeezed out mechanically to maintain a layer of fluid on the cartilage surface (so-called &quot;weeping lubrication&quot;).
The functions of the synovial fluid include:

*reduction of friction — synovial fluid lubricates the articulating joints
*shock absorption — as a dilatant fluid, that possesses rheopectic properties, becoming more viscous under applied pressure; the synovial fluid in joints becomes thick the moment shear is applied in order to protect the joint and subsequently, thins to normal viscosity instantaneously to resume its lubricating function between shocks. 
*nutrient and waste transportation — the fluid supplies oxygen and nutrients and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes from the chondrocytes in the surrounding cartilage
*molecular sieving - pressure within the joint forces hyaluronan in the fluid against the synovial membrane forming a barrier against cells migrating into, or fluid migrating out of, the joint space. This function is dependent on the molecular weight of the hyaluronan.

===Composition===
Synovial tissue is sterile and composed of vascularized connective tissue that lacks a basement membrane. Two cell types (type A and type B) are present: Type A is derived from blood monocytes, and it removes the wear-and-tear debris from the synovial fluid. Type B produces hyaluronan. Synovial fluid is made of hyaluronic acid and lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Synovial fluid exhibits non-Newtonian flow characteristics; the viscosity coefficient is not a constant and the fluid is not linearly viscous. Synovial fluid has anti-thixotropic characteristics; under conditions of sudden increase in pressure as in some kind of mechanical shock, its viscosity suddenly increases. Normal synovial fluid contains 3–4 mg/ml hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), a polymer of disaccharides composed of D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine joined by alternating beta-1,4 and beta-1,3 glycosidic bonds. Hyaluronan is synthesized by the synovial membrane and secreted into the joint cavity to increase the viscosity and elasticity of articular cartilages and to lubricate the surfaces between synovium and cartilage.

Synovial fluid contains lubricin (also known as PRG4) as a second lubricating component, secreted by synovial fibroblasts. Chiefly, it is responsible for so-called boundary-layer lubrication, which reduces friction between opposing surfaces of cartilage. There also is some evidence that it helps regulate synovial cell growth.

It also contains phagocytic cells that remove microbes and the debris that results from normal wear and tear in the joint.

==Clinical significance==

===Collection===
Synovial fluid may be collected by syringe in a procedure termed arthrocentesis, also known as joint aspiration.

===Classification===
Synovial fluid may be classified into normal, noninflammatory, inflammatory, septic, and hemorrhagic:

Glucose (mg/dl) concentration in synovial fluid is nearly equal to serum.
;Synovial fluid viscosity
&quot;Normal&quot;:
*Normal
*Traumatic arthritis
*Degenerative (Osteo) arthritis
* Pigmented villonodular synovitis
&quot;Normal or decreased&quot;:
*Systemic lupus erythematosus
&quot;Decreased&quot;:
*Rheumatic fever
*Rheumatoid arthritis
*Gout
*Pyogenic (Septic) arthritis
* Tubercular arthritis
* Less of lubrication in joints

===Pathology===

Many synovial fluid types are associated with specific diagnoses:

==Analysis==
Glucose (mg/dl) concentration in synovial fluid is nearly equal to serum.

The cytological and biochemical analysis of human synovial fluid began around 1940 using cadaver-derived fluid and comparing characteristics to those of, for instance, bovine synovial fluid.

=== Chemistry ===
The mucin clot test is a very old approach to determining if an inflammatory infiltrate is present. In this test, acetic acid is added to the synovial fluid specimen. In a normal specimen, this should lead to a congealing of the hyaluronic acid, forming a &#x27;mucin clot.&#x27; If inflammation is present, a mucin clot is not formed (the hyaluronic acid is degraded).

Lactate is elevated in septic arthritis, usually above 250 mg/dL.

Complement factors are decreased in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus arthritis.

=== Microscopy ===
Microscopic analysis of synovial fluid is performed to evaluate for cell count and crystals. Crystals include monosodium urate crystals, calcium pyrophosphate, hydroxyapatite and corticosteroid crystals.

Monosodium urate crystals are seen in gout or gouty arthritis and appear as needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals varying in length from 2 to 20 μm. With negative birefringence, the crystals appear yellow in parallel light and blue with perpendicular light.

Calcium pyrophosphate crystals are seen in pseudogout (also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or, CPPD). These crystals are rod-shaped or rhomboids varying in length from 2 to 20 μm and with positive birefringence (blue with parallel light, yellow with perpendicular light).

Hydroxyapatite crystals are small and negatively birefringent. They are usually only detectable with an Alizarin Red S stain.

Corticosteroid crystals may be seen following therapeutic corticosteroid injection into the joint space. They appear blunt, jagged, and show variable birefringence.

===Cracking joints===

When the two articulating surfaces of a synovial joint are separated from one other, the volume within the joint capsule is increased and a negative pressure results. The volume of synovial fluid within the joint is insufficient to fill the expanding volume of the joint and gases dissolved in the synovial fluid (mostly carbon dioxide) are liberated and quickly fill the empty space, leading to the rapid formation of a bubble. This process is known as cavitation. Cavitation in synovial joints results in a high frequency &#x27;cracking&#x27; sound.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The term &quot;synovia&quot; () came to English around 1640 (the anglicized form &quot;synovial&quot; is first recorded in the mid 18th century) from Neo-Latin, where it was coined perhaps by Paracelsus from Greek &quot;&quot; &quot;with&quot; and Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;egg&quot; and &quot;&quot; because it resembles egg white in consistency and external appearance.

The term &quot;synovium&quot; is a much more recent pseudo-Latin coinage for what is less confusingly called the synovial membrane. It is not recorded in general dictionaries, and medical dictionaries only explain its meaning, not its etymology, but it is apparently derived from the term &quot;synovia&quot;, i.e. the obfuscated etymology of mixed Greek and Latin elements of the singular term &quot;synovia&quot; was misunderstood and the word was erroneously reinterpreted as the plural of the previously non-existent term &quot;synovium&quot; (perhaps in analogy to other plural terms for liquids such as &quot;waters&quot; for amniotic fluid). If one insists on using this pseudo-Latin term &quot;synovium&quot; for the synovial membrane, the non-Latinate plural &quot;synoviums&quot; is better and less confusing than &quot;synovia&quot;.

<text>John Scarne (; March 4, 1903 – July 7, 1985) was an American magician and author who was particularly adept at playing card manipulation. He became known as an expert on cards and other games, and authored a number of popular books on cards, gambling, and related topics.

==Early life==
He was born Orlando Carmelo Scarnecchia in Steubenville, Ohio, United States, and at some point anglicized his name to John Scarne. He grew up in the New Jersey communities of Fairview and Guttenberg. When he left school after the eighth grade, he learned from a local card sharp how to perform such swindles as The Three Card Monte, and how to cheat in gambling card games by manipulating the cards.

Scarne began practicing sleight of hand with the goal of becoming a card sharp, but his Roman Catholic mother dissuaded her son from gambling in general, and cheating others in particular. She persuaded him to practice magic instead.

One of Scarne&#x27;s influences was Nate Leipzig. Of Leipzig, Scarne said, &quot;Whatever I can do, is because Nate Leipzig showed me how to do it.&quot; Scarne soon extended his skill at handling cards to learning—and devising—magical effects with cards. He spent a few months learning about crooked gambling devices (including marked cards and loaded dice) at a nearby novelty store. Thanks to his endless practice, Scarne began making money as a magician.

==Career==
Gradually, Scarne became an expert at not only magical effects, but games of all kinds as well. Articles were written about him in various magazines, and he was hired as a consultant or adviser by various companies, as well as by the US Army, which sent him to bases around the world in order to educate soldiers about the dangers of card and dice cheats. He wrote fifteen books and co-wrote a few more for a total of twenty-eight books on games, including &quot;Scarne on Dice&quot;, &quot;Scarne&#x27;s Guide to Modern Poker&quot; and &quot;Scarne&#x27;s New Complete Guide to Gambling&quot;. He also wrote two autobiographies: &quot;The Amazing World of John Scarne: A Personal History&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Odds Against Me&quot; (1966). He served as a technical advisor in the 1973 motion picture &quot;The Sting&quot;, and doubled for actor Paul Newman&#x27;s hands during scenes that involved card manipulations and deck switching.
Scarne was often proclaimed by experts, magicians and editors of the time to be the greatest card manipulator of all time. But he was happiest when inventing (and marketing, through his company John Scarne Games, Inc.) new games, which he did quite a bit. And he was especially proud of one called &quot;Teeko&quot;, which he invented in 1945 (version withdrawn), re-invented in 1952 and modified in the 1960s. He was so proud of the game that he named his son John Teeko Scarne. Teeko quickly spread around the world. However, Scarne never made a profit on the game, mainly due to water damage in a warehouse which destroyed the entire stock of Teeko sets in one day. Today Teeko is virtually unknown.

Scarne&#x27;s most famous card trick was titled &quot;Scarne&#x27;s Aces&quot;. The trick involved taking a spectator&#x27;s shuffled deck of cards, performing a series of riffle shuffles himself and then cutting to all four aces. Another one of Scarne&#x27;s most notable card effects was the triple coincidence, in which a spectator and a magician each pick three different playing cards out of two regular decks of opposite colors and it is shown that all of the selections match. Scarne also created a quadruple coincidence, wherein a spectator selects a card and four apparently impossible predictions of their card are made.

Scarne also attempted to discredit Edward O. Thorp&#x27;s card counting system for the game of blackjack.
In his 1966 autobiography &quot;The Odds Against Me&quot;, he analyzed Thorp&#x27;s system and concluded that the whole system was loaded with mathematical errors, and that it was pure fiction dreamed by Thorp. Scarne also dismissed Wilson&#x27;s famous blackjack point count system as &quot;hokum&quot;. Scarne offered a challenge to blackjack card counters, but the prospective participants were never able to agree upon its terms.

In &quot;The Odds Against Me&quot;, Scarne described his own technique for counting down up to four-deck blackjack with the rules generally used in Las Vegas in 1947: Scarne made use of his stacks of chips as a device to help track the contents of the undealt cards.
A more complete description of his technique is present in his later book, &quot;Scarne&#x27;s Guide to Casino Gambling&quot;, where he also described preventative measures taken by casinos to combat card counting.

==Personal life==
Scarne married Steffi Storm (née Norma Kearney) in 1955, with their son John born the same year. Scarne died on July 7, 1985, at 82, while living in North Bergen, New Jersey.

<doc id="1089777" wikidata="Q748591" url="?curid=1089777" title="Haltwhistle">
<text>Haltwhistle is a market town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, east of Carlisle and west of Newcastle upon Tyne. It had a population of 3,811 at the 2011 Census.

Haltwhistle is the closest community to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and to Northumberland National Park, both approximately distant.

==The name==
The name Haltwhistle has nothing to do with a railway stop. Early forms of the name are Hautwesel (1240), Hautwysel (1254), Hawtewysill (1279), Hautwysell (1381), Haltwesell (Speede 1610). The second part -twistle relates to two streams or rivers. It derives from two Old English words &quot;twicce&quot; or &quot;twise&quot;, &#x27;twice&#x27;, &#x27;division into two&#x27; and &quot;wella&quot;, &#x27;stream, brook&#x27;. The second word is reduced in the compound word to &quot;ull&quot;, making &quot;twicculla&quot;, &quot;twisella&quot;. All but one of the examples in place names represent a high tongue of land between two streams where they join.

The first part is probably derived from Old English &quot;hēafod&quot;, here &#x27;hill-top&#x27;, in general, &#x27;head&#x27;, &#x27;headland&#x27;, &#x27;summit&#x27;, &#x27;upper end&#x27; or &#x27;source of a stream&#x27;. If so, it describes the hill-top on which Holy Cross Church and the oldest part of Haltwhistle was built, enclosed on the north-east and west by Haltwhistle Burn and on the south by the South Tyne. Rowland suggests Hal from &#x27;hill&#x27; 
A suggestion is French &quot;haut-&quot;, meaning &#x27;high&#x27;, since the settlement already existed long before the Norman Conquest.

A Town web site suggests that Haltwhistle signifies either &quot;the high hill by two rivers&quot; or &quot;the watch on high&quot;.

==History==
Haltwhistle was probably in existence in Roman times, as it is one of the closest approaches of the River South Tyne in its upland reaches to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The old Roman road known as the Stanegate, which is thought to predate Hadrian’s Wall by some forty years or so, passes just to the north of the town.

The town web site summarizes an important part of the history (late Middle Ages) of the community as: &quot;for many centuries, the constant marauding of English and Scots caused turmoil in Haltwhistle and throughout the Borders&quot;.
In 1598, &quot;the infamous Armstrongs of Liddesdale fired and plundered Haltwhistle&quot;. Another important raid on Haltwhistle was made in 1601 by the Scots &quot;who carried away prisoners and all their goods&quot;; they were later reclaimed by a raid on Liddesdale. Scots, particularly the Armstrongs, later returned and burned many houses; that led to &quot;years of feuds between the Armstrongs and the Ridley&#x27;s of Haltwhistle&quot;. 

Celia Fiennes did not entirely enjoy her visit in the 1690s:&quot;This Hartwhistle is a Little town, there was one Inn but they had noe hay nor would get none, and when my servants had got some Else where they were angry and would not Entertaine me, so I was forced to take up in a poor Cottage wch was open to ye Thatch and no partitions but hurdles plaistered. Indeed ye Loft as they Called it wch was over the other roomes was shelter&#x27;d but wth a hurdle; here I was fforced to take up my abode and ye Landlady brought me out her best sheetes wch serv&#x27;d to secure my own sheetes from her dirty blanckets, and Indeed I had her fine sheete to spread over ye top of the Clothes; but noe sleepe Could I get, they burning turff and their Chimneys are sort of fflews or open tunnills, yt ye smoake does annoy the roomes. This is but from another part of Scotland, the houses are but a Little better built, its true the inside of them are kept a Little better.&quot;

Dorothy, Lady Capell, endowed a school in Haltwhistle in her will of 1721.

The development of the town benefited from its location on the main Newcastle to Carlisle road and on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway line. 

The expansion of Haltwhistle in the 18th and 19th centuries was due to coal mining in the area and to a lesser extent the use of Haltwhistle as a loading point for metal ores coming from the mines on Alston Moor to the south. In 1836 while some workmen were quarrying stone for the Directors of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, on the top of Barcombe, a high hill in the township of Thorngrafton and Parish of Haltwhistle, one of them found a copper vessel containing 63 coins, 3 of them gold and 60 copper. The gold coins were, one of Claudius Caesar, reverse Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus; one of Nero and one of Vespasian. The find is known as the Thorngrafton Hoard and the empty arm-purse can still be seen in the museum at Chesters Fort.

More recently, paint manufacture became a major commercial force in the town, but has now stopped major production. Current local employers include factories making plastic bottles and de-icing products.

In the 21st century, the tourist industry dominates the economy with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and walking and rambling counting among the principal interests of tourists. The Town web site summarizes the appeal of the area which is &quot;within easy reach of Newcastle and Carlisle&quot;. Skirted by the Northumberland National Park and the North Pennines range, Haltwhistle is ideal for activity and family holidays, walking, cycling, fishing and climbing. Close to where the North &amp; South Tynes meet, with many pretty villages dotted along both river valleys...

== Early economy ==
Haltwhistle was a market town for the exchange of local goods. In the 18th century two Quakers set up a baize manufactury and there was a weaving establishment. On the Haltwhistle Burn were fulling mills, dyeing and spinning mills. A walk along this stream to the Roman Wall, shows that it must have been a hive of industry with quarries, coal mining and lime burning kilns. The Directory of 1822 (Pigot) gives a whole range of craftsmen, shopkeepers and traders; 60 in number, including makers of clogs. The weekly market was held on Thursdays and there were fairs on 14 May and 22 November for cattle and sheep.

==Landmarks==
Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to the north of the town is used as a major selling point for the town. The section of the wall closest to Haltwhistle is among the most spectacular and complete, with the wall striding eastwards from the lake at Crag Lough along the spine of the Whin Sill.
The remains of Haltwhistle Castle and the series of Bastles, and Haltwhistle Tower. Haltwhistle also claims to be at the geographic centre of Britain – equidistant from the sea as measured along the principal points of the compass. A hotel in the centre of Haltwhistle is named the &quot;Centre of Britain Hotel&quot; in recognition of this claim. The claim is rather tenuous as it requires that the northern extremity is taken to be Orkney rather than Shetland. Depending on how the centre of the island is calculated, however, the centre can be said to be Dunsop Bridge in Lancashire. See centre points of the United Kingdom.

A Border reivers&#x27; Peel Tower, circa 15th century, is now part of the Centre of Britain hotel and the town contains five Bastle houses (fortified farm houses). Roughly three miles distant from the town centre are Blenkinsop Hall and Blenkinsopp Castle, both Grade II listed buildings. The Grade I listed Thirlwall Castle is located four miles from Haltwhistle.

Other historic properties nearby include Featherstone Castle, Unthank Hall, Bellister Castle and Coanwood Friends Meeting House.

Haltwhistle Viaduct lies to the south of the railway station and was the first major feature on the Alston Line to Alston, Cumbria.

===Other features===
Stone-built houses are a feature of Haltwhistle. It is one of two settlements in Great Britain which claim to be the exact geographic centre of the island, along with Dunsop Bridge in Lancashire, to the south.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of the Holy Cross is situated below the Market Place, with views over the river and the valley. This is a Grade II listed building said to be &quot;one of only a few early 13th century churches still functioning as a working church in England&quot;. One of the tombs is that of crusader Thomas de Blenkinsopp who died in 1388. There are a number of other medieval grave covers to the Blenkinsopps and the Thirlwells.

It is a good example of a North Country church, impressive considering the time when it was built in the thirteenth century. The chancel measures , with lancet windows – combined three lights in the east end and four single lights on each side, the walls being supported by buttresses. Inside is a piscina (for washing) and three sedilia (seats for the clergy). The nave measures and has side aisles above which are clerestory windows. It has four bays with round columns and pointed arches, looking very spacious inside. The font, dated 1676, has some curious crude carvings on it, and there is another large circular bowl on a shaft, which is probably an earlier font. At the west end it has long lancet windows and a bell-cote, again typical of the North country.

Nearby, the village of Coanwood houses a small but historic chapel, designated as Grade II* by English Heritage. The summary states: &quot;...dated 1760 on lintel. Squared stone with rusticated quoins and dressings&quot;. Coanwood Friends Meeting House was a Quaker place of worship and is maintained to this day as a historical site open to visitors.

== Governance ==

Haltwhistle is currently in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham; Joe Morris of the Labour Party is the Member of Parliament. 

For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority, with Haltwhistle lying in the &quot;Tynedale Division&quot;. Prior to the 2009 structural changes to local government in England it was part of Tynedale Council. Prior to the 1974 great reorganisation, it belonged to the county of Northumberland. The Old Town Hall in Haltwhistle is now used as a hair salon.

An electoral ward with the same name still exists. This ward stretches from Hexham south up the River Tyne South and has a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 4,832.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Border.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Capital North East, Heart North East and Hits Radio North East.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Hexham Courant&quot;.

== Transport ==
;Railway

The town is served by Haltwhistle railway station on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, also known as the Tyne Valley Line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear with Carlisle in Cumbria. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland.

Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Railway are operated by Northern and ScotRail. The line is also heavily used for freight. The railway station is on the south side of the town, close by the River South Tyne.

Until 1976, the railway station was also the junction of the branch line to Alston, in Cumbria, which was in length. Part of the southern section of the Haltwhistle to Alston line has been reopened as a narrow gauge railway, known as the South Tynedale Railway, between Alston and Slaggyford. The trust that owns and operates the railway intends to reopen the entire branch line from Alston to Haltwhistle.

;Road
The A69 trunk road, which links Carlisle and Newcastle upon Tyne, formerly passed south of the town centre and through its western outskirts, until a full bypass was opened in 1997.

<doc id="1089783" wikidata="Q1515038" url="?curid=1089783" title="Thyroid hormone resistance">
<text>Thyroid hormone resistance (also resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), and sometimes Refetoff syndrome) describes a rare syndrome in which the thyroid hormone levels are elevated but the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is not suppressed, or not completely suppressed as would be expected. The first report of the condition appeared in 1967. Essentially this is decreased end organ responsiveness to thyroid hormones. A new term &quot;impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone&quot; has been suggested in March 2014 by Refetoff et al.

==Presentation==
The syndrome can present with variable symptoms, even between members of the same family harboring the same mutation. Typically most or all tissues are resistant to thyroid hormone, so despite raised measures of serum thyroid hormone the individual may appear euthyroid (have no symptoms of over- or underactivity of the thyroid gland). The most common symptoms are goiter and tachycardia. It has also been linked to some cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although the majority of people with that diagnosis have no thyroid problems.
An association with depression has been proposed.

==Causes==
Normal thyroid hormone function requires normal thyroid hormone transport across cell membrane, appropriate deiodination, thyroid hormone nuclear receptor, thyroid hormone response elements, co-activators, co-repressors, and normal histone acetylation. Any abnormalities in this chain can result in thyroid hormone resistance and it has not been as well studied as the various forms of insulin resistance.

The most well known cause of the syndrome are mutations of the β (beta) form (&quot;THRB&quot; gene) of the thyroid hormone receptor, of which over 100 different mutations have been documented.
Mutations in &quot;MCT8&quot; and &quot;SECISBP2&quot; have also been associated with this condition.

== Regulation of thyroid hormone secretion ==
Hypothalamus secretes a hormone called thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) which in turn release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH signals thyroid to secrete thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T4 gets converted to active T3 in peripheral tissues with the help of deiodinase enzymes. T3 negatively feedback on the pituitary and decreases TSH secretion.

==Diagnosis==
The characteristic blood test results for this disorder can also be found in other disorders (for example TSH-oma (pituitary adenoma), or other pituitary disorders). The diagnosis may involve identifying a mutation of the thyroid receptor, which is present in approximately 85% of cases.

==Management==
Beta blockers, like metoprolol, are sometimes used to help suppress symptoms.

==Incidence==
Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome is rare, incidence is variously quoted as 1 in 50,000 or 1 in 40,000 live births. More than 1000 individuals have been identified with thyroid hormone resistance, of which 85% had thyroid hormone beta receptor mutation.

<doc id="1089791" wikidata="Q744726" url="?curid=1089791" title="Abernethy, Perth and Kinross">
<text>Abernethy is a village and former burgh in the Perth and Kinross council area and historic county of Perthshire, in the east central Lowlands of Scotland. The village is situated in rural Strathearn, south-east of the city of Perth, near the River Earn&#x27;s confluence with the River Tay and on the northern edge of the Ochil Hills.

Formerly the site of a number of Roman encampments, Abernethy became an important Pictish religious and political centre. The village was the setting for the Treaty of Abernethy, where Malcolm Canmore gave allegiance to William the Conqueror and its mediaeval round tower marks the site of a former abbey and, later, collegiate church.

The civil parish of Abernethy also contains the nearby settlement of Aberargie and traditionally extends to Mugdrum Island in the Firth of Tay. It is part of the Almond and Earn ward for elections to Perth and Kinross Council

==History==
===Etymology===
Abernethy, recorded in the 10th century as &quot;Aburnethige&quot;, means &#x27;mouth of the river Nethy&#x27;. The first element of the name is the Pictish word &quot;aber&quot; &#x27;river mouth&#x27;. The river-name Nethy is from the Celtic root &quot;nect&quot;- &#x27;pure, clean&#x27;. The Nethy Burn flows down from the Ochil Hills past the present village. The Gaelic form of the name is &quot;Obar Neithich&quot;.

Near to Abernethy lies the small settlement of Catochil, whose name is first attested in a sixteenth-century copy of a text from 1295, as &quot;Cathehill&quot;, and again in 1508 as &quot;Catoichill&quot;. This place-name too is thought to be from Pictish, or its close relative Common Brittonic, from the elements *&quot;ced&quot; (&quot;woodland&quot;) and *&quot;ogel&quot; (&quot;high&quot;, its form influenced by the name of the Ochil Hills among which it lies).

===Early history===

There is evidence of early settlement in the area, with a Bronze Age log boat being discovered at Carpow in 2001, believed to date from around 1,000 BC. The Carpow boat is one of the best-preserved examples in Britain, and the second-oldest example of a boat recovered in Scotland. Remains of suspected pre-historic stone circles have been discovered to the north and south of the village. Castle Law was the site of an Iron Age hillfort, first excavated in the late 19th century.

A group of Roman sites within the village have been given the name &quot;the Abernethy complex&quot;, including later use of the fortress at Castle Law and the site of the former Carpow Roman Fort to the east of the village.

===Middle Ages===

The village was once the &quot;capital&quot; (or at least a major religious and political centre) of the kingdom of the Picts. The parish church, which sits on land given by Nechtan, king of the Picts, is dedicated to Saint Brigid of Kildare of (fl. 451–525), and the church is said to have been founded by Dairlugdach, second abbess of Kildare, one of early Christian Ireland&#x27;s major monasteries.

Several pieces of Pictish or early medieval sculpture have been found in Abernethy, including an incomplete Pictish symbol stone attached to the base of the round tower. The location &quot;Afarnach&#x27;s Hall&quot; referred to in the earliest mediaeval Arthurian literature is usually identified as Abernethy.

Abernethy is believed to have been the seat of an early Pictish bishopric, its diocese extending westward along Strathearn. In the 12th century the bishop&#x27;s seat was moved to Muthill, then Dunblane, so that Abernethy, no longer being a residential bishopric is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

In 1072, Abernethy was the site of the Treaty of Abernethy concluded between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland.

Abernethy remained the site of a small priory of Augustinian canons, founded 1272. In the 15th century, this priory was suppressed in favour of a collegiate church under the patronage of the Douglas Earls of Angus. Remains of the collegiate church survived until 1802 within the present village graveyard, when they were replaced by the present plain red sandstone church, which is still dedicated to Saint Brigid.

===Modern history===
Abernethy was granted a charter as a burgh of barony in 1476 by the 5th Earl of Angus, a status confirmed in 1628 by the 11th Earl. The Earl of Angus and Lord Abernethy have become subsidiary titles of the Dukes of Hamilton. It later became a police burgh and held its burgh status and instruments of local government until the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.

In 1933, Powrie Park was gifted to the burgh by William Powrie as a memorial and is maintained as common good land by Perth and Kinross Council.

In October 1909, future Prime Minister Winston Churchill spoke at a political rally in the village, which was protested by a group of Suffragettes including Adela Pankhurst.

In the Second World War, the village hosted a camp for Polish forces and was the destination for a number of evacuees. In 2012, the London Olympics torch relay passed through Abernethy as part of its progress around the British Isles.

==Culture and community==

Abernethy was formerly associated with agriculture, including soft fruit production, salmon fishing and weaving.

A general store is found in the village&#x27;s Main Street. The local post office was replaced in 2009 with a mobile service. The village also hosts a public house, museum, garden centre, public park and heritage gardens.

A Gala / Fete Day is held annually on the first or second Saturday in June, with a race to the top of nearby Castle Law taking place the following day.

===Museum of Abernethy===

The Museum of Abernethy in the village opened in May 2000 and is open to the public during May to September each year. It also holds a key to the round tower.

===Religion===
The village falls within the Church of Scotland&#x27;s ecclesiastical parish of Abernethy, Dron and Arngask. The village&#x27;s parish church is known as the Kirk of St Bride and dates to the 19th century, built on the site of a former mediaeval church and on the site of the former monastery.

The former South United Free Church building, constructed in 1866, remains in the village, but has been deconsecrated.

===Twinning===
Abernethy is twinned with Grisy-Suisnes in the Île-de-France.

==Landmarks==

The historic core of Abernethy is designated as a conservation area with protections against development. A number of listed buildings are also designated within the village and the wider parish.

===Abernethy Round Tower===

The village has one of Scotland&#x27;s two surviving Irish-style round towers (the other is at Brechin, Angus); both are in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. The tower stands high, and it is possible to climb to the top, using a modern metal spiral staircase (the tower originally had several wooden floors linked by ladders). The tower was evidently built in two stages (shown by a change in the masonry), and probably dates from the 11th to early 12th centuries.

===Abernethy cross===
The village&#x27;s war memorial is modelled on a former market cross and was unveiled in the village&#x27;s square in 1921. It records the names of 30 men from Abernethy who died in the First World War and the names of a further eight who died in the Second World War were added later.

===Balvaird Castle===

The 15th century Balvaird Castle, a mediaeval tower house, is located outside of the village.

==Governance==
Abernethy and its surrounding district are represented by Abernethy community council. The local authority is Perth and Kinross Council with Abernethy falling within the Almond and Earn ward, one of twelve in the council area. The ward elects three councillors.

For elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Abernethy is part of the Perth and Kinross-shire constituency in the House of Commons. For elections to the devolved Scottish Parliament, it is part of the Perthshire South and Kinross-shire constituency and the Mid Scotland and Fife region.

===Historic local government===
The main settlement of Abernethy was created as a burgh since 1476, while a wider parish included neighbouring small settlements such as Aberargie and had local government functions until 1930. The parish partly extended from Perthshire into neighbouring Fife until boundary changes.

The burgh was held initially as a burgh of barony under the Earl of Angus who held the title of Lord Abernethy. Both titles are now held by the Dukes of Hamilton. Under this system, baronial courts dealt with local issues and administered justice.

In 1877, the burgh became a police burgh, with local administration carried out by Commissioners of Police. These were replaced by Abernethy Town Council in 1901 with its status evolving into a small burgh. In 1947, Alan Gomme-Duncan, Perth&#x27;s Member of Parliament noted in the House of Commons that: &quot;&quot;Abernethy is probably one of the best examples in Scotland of an extremely efficiently run burgh of 700 inhabitants, with a live, wide-awake spirit, which produces an excellently run place to the obvious advantage of all who live there, and an example to many larger burghs nothing like so well run&quot;.&quot;

The town council, headed by a provost, continued to provide local government until its abolition in 1975 under wide-ranging local government reforms. Its powers were taken on by the Tayside Regional Council and Perth and Kinross District Council. In 1996, a unitary authority, Perth and Kinross Council was created.

==Transport==

The village is located near the M90 motorway, sitting on the A913 road, connecting to Cupar to the east and onward through the A912 to Perth in the west. There is a bus service to nearby towns.

Abernethy railway station served the village until 1955, when it was closed by the British Transport Commission. The line continues to operate as a branch of the Edinburgh–Dundee line, running between Perth and Ladybank. A campaign exists to re-open the neighbouring village of Newburgh&#x27;s railway station.

==Education==
The village maintains a single non-denominational state primary school. Abernethy Primary School&#x27;s current building was constructed in 2002 and expanded in 2013. In 2023, the school roll was 148 pupils.

== References ==
===Notes===
:1. The foundation of Abernethy is to be found in the Pictish Chronicle and links it to Nechtan Morbet. However, it may have been Nechtan nepos Uerb, and the later Nechtan mac Der-Ilei may have been confused with the previous two.

<text>1,4-Cyclohexadiene is an organic compound with the formula C6H8. It is a colourless, flammable liquid that is of academic interest as a prototype of a large class of related compounds called terpenoids, an example being γ-terpinene. An isomer of this compound is 1,3-cyclohexadiene.

==Synthesis and reactions==
In the laboratory, substituted 1,4-cyclohexadienes are synthesized by Birch reduction of related aromatic compounds using an alkali metal dissolved in liquid ammonia and a proton donor such as an alcohol. In this way, over reduction to the fully saturated ring is avoided. 
1,4-Cyclohexadiene and its derivatives are easily aromatized, the driving force being the formation of an aromatic ring. The conversion to an aromatic system may be used to trigger other reactions, such as the Bergman cyclization.

<text>Airth () is a Royal Burgh, village, former trading port and civil parish in Falkirk, Scotland. It is north of Falkirk town and sits on the banks of the River Forth. Airth lies on the A905 road between Grangemouth and Stirling and is overlooked by Airth Castle; the village retains two market crosses and a small number of historic houses. At the time of the 2001 census the village had a population of 1,273 residents but this has been revised to 1,660 according to a 2008 estimate.

In July of each year it hosts a traditional Scottish Highland Games.

==History==
The village has long association with the River Forth and it was on the banks of the river that a royal dockyard was created. In September 1506 Andrew Aytoun was paid for &quot;casting of the dock in the Poll of Erth&quot; for the ship. The dock was used during the years 1507–1513 in the reign of James IV to build ships of war at the pool of Airth. In 1511 and 1512 Robert Calendar made three docks, a stable for 50 horses, and a larger dock for the &quot;Margaret&quot;. Calendar&#x27;s men also worked on the &quot;Lark&quot; and the &quot;James&quot;.

A form of dry dock may have been used. Strong timbers would be used to form the “stocks” for the vessel and a clay dam would prevent the river from penetrating the working area. When the ship was ready, the dam would be breached, at high tide, to enable it to float out into the river.

The shipping fleet was destroyed in 1745 by Bonnie Prince Charlie when some ship to shore skirmishes took place by batteries set by Jacobites to drive off the government ships. A number of smaller vessels from the village were burned by loyalist troops and that proved damaging to Airth&#x27;s subsequent development as a port. However, as late as 1820 sloops built in the shipyards at Airth were among those recorded as operating in the middle of the Forth .

Dunmore Park and the Dunmore Pineapple is an historic estate in Airth, formerly the ancestral residence of the Earl of Dunmore.

The name Airth comes from the Gaelic term &quot;Àird&quot; meaning a height or hill after the nearby Hill of Airth.

<doc id="1089806" wikidata="Q1936725" url="?curid=1089806" title="White Light, White Heat, White Trash">
<text>White Light, White Heat, White Trash is the fifth studio album by American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on September 17, 1996, by 550 Music and Epic Records. The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn. After the release of Social Distortion&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;, the band toured until the end of 1993 and needed a break. After dealing with court battles over early recordings and attempting to retrieve them, package them up, and release them, Social Distortion wrote many songs to plan a new album.

Social Distortion guitarist and singer Mike Ness was disappointed with the way music was during the 1990s, including punk rock and rock music in general. He wanted to make a new album that would be considered Social Distortion&#x27;s best album and wanted to bring back the characteristics and emotions of 1970s punk rock. &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; includes fewer rock and roll, country and blues influences than the three previous Social Distortion albums, and instead, &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; is a stylistic return to the band&#x27;s 1980s hardcore punk-era such as their debut &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;. The album has more introspective and personal lyrics about topics like grief, regret, looking back to the past, and making changes or improvements in one&#x27;s life. The lyrics were inspired by Ness&#x27; past, which involved drugs, alcohol, and jail.

Reviews for &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; were mixed-to-positive, with the musical style and lyrical content being praised by some critics and criticized by other critics. The album experienced moderate success and peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 30,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States. Selling 10,000 to 12,000 copies weekly, &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; sold 277,000 copies in the United States as of December 31, 1998, according to Nielsen SoundScan, making it Social Distortion&#x27;s third best-selling album. The album&#x27;s two singles are &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; and &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot;. &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; experienced chart success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, playing frequently on rock radio and MTV. &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; lacked chart success compared to &quot;I Was Wrong&quot;. Social Distortion planned to tour both inside and outside the United States, given that the band began to attract people outside the United States instead of solely attracting Americans. Social Distortion also performed at Warped Tour 1997 along with bands like Lagwagon, Less Than Jake, and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

==Background, writing, and recording==

After the release of &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; in 1992, Social Distortion went touring and they toured until the end of 1993. The band&#x27;s guitarist and singer Mike Ness said the band &quot;needed a break.&quot; Social Distortion then had to be involved in some court battles to retrieve some of the band&#x27;s early recordings. The recording were not in the band&#x27;s possession and the recordings were unavailable to the public, too. The band &quot;had to retrieve them, package them up and put them out.&quot; Social Distortion wrote 25 songs for a new album because the band wanted to write an album &quot;that would stand out&quot;, according to Ness. &quot;We wanted to make &#x27;The Record&#x27;,&quot; he explained. He claims there&#x27;s a few songs on each Social Distortion album that he hated &quot;because we just did &#x27;em, and settled for it and didn&#x27;t challenge it.&quot;

Social Distortion wrote a dozen songs in 1994 for a new album, but were told by producer Michael Beinhorn that most of the songs would not work. Ness says: &quot;He saw something inside that needed to come out, and we weren&#x27;t quite achieving it. We went back in and did more writing. We ended up keeping two of those twelve songs.&quot; Initially, Ness was upset but the two &quot;gained a mutual respect for each other.&quot; Ness decided the two &quot;were on the right track&quot; and saw the situation as an exciting challenge. The title to &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; was a reference to the 1949 film &quot;White Heat&quot; and the Velvet Underground album &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;. When recording started in the late spring of 1995, Beinhorn decided that drummer Randy Carr was not providing the studio sound Beinhorn sought. Ness trusted the producer enough to agree to the decision. A session player, Deen Castronovo, participated in the recording. After he participated, he stopped playing for Social Distortion and drummer Chuck Biscuits, former drummer for bands like Black Flag, Danzig, D.O.A. and the Circle Jerks, joined Social Distortion. The album was recorded from August 1995 to June 1996 in Bearsville Studio in Woodstock, New York. &quot;Going back to basics&quot; was considered the philosophy that underlay the recording process of &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;. As a result, Beinhorn solely used analog and vintage equipment in the studio. Ness claimed that during the cutting of the guitar tracks, he used a &#x27;68 Gold Top reissue with P-90 pickups, a few SG reissues and a Silvertone through various Fenders, Marshalls and Soldanos. Ness said: &quot;Me and [Social Distortion guitarist] Dennis Danell really wanted to get an sound,&quot; said Ness. &quot;Something with a bottom end that would hit you right in the chest.&quot; Ness claims that Social Distortion &quot;used all analog equipment until the very last moment&quot;, which he considered similar to 1970s rock.

Ness was disappointed with the state of music that existed during the 1990s. When he wrote &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;, he was &quot;reacting against&quot; 1990s music. Rejecting grunge, Ness was inspired by the style of 1970s punk bands like The Clash, the New York Dolls, Generation X, the Dead Boys, and Johnny Thunders. Ness said he &quot;don&#x27;t like hardly anybody&quot; who was making music during the 1990s. He then said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to listen to this stuff. I want to listen to the real thing. It&#x27;s very hard for me to get inspired by contemporary music.&quot; Ness said that 1970s punk rock &quot;was also the only music at the time accurately portraying how I felt inside.&quot; Expressing his opinion of the way music was during the 1990s, Ness said: &quot;Our intention is to bring back the soul and emotion of that first wave of punk in the late &#x27;70s, which I feel is sorely lacking today&quot;. He then said: &quot;Punk has become a formula now. It&#x27;s basically Cheap Trick with louder guitars,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of passion has been lost as it&#x27;s become more marketable. The masses have decided that punk rock is safe, but we were doing this music when it was unpopular.&quot; Ness believed that punk rock was no longer countercultural or dangerous in the 1990s. &quot;Punk was more dangerous back then,&quot; he recalls. &quot;In Orange County in 1979, if you walked down the street in a leather jacket and spiked hair, you made a decision that you would have a confrontation that day.&quot; Ness said &quot;there&#x27;s just things going on today that just would never have been allowed&quot; in the early years of punk rock, and he said that heavy metal, for example, was hated by punk rock musicians and fans during punk rock&#x27;s early years. He then criticized grunge bands like Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots, describing them as &quot;just Led Zeppelin with a pierced nose and short hair.&quot; Ness made an exception for grunge band Nirvana, saying he &quot;believed them&quot;.

Social Distortion wanted to go back to its late 1970s and early 1980s punk rock roots with &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;. Ness said &quot;I don&#x27;t want this to be just another Social D record. I want it to be the Social D record.&quot; Ness said: &quot;The last thing I wanted to write was a cute alternative record,&quot; he says. &quot;This album is about going back to the genuine emotion and rock basics that fueled the first wave of punk.&quot; Social Distortion&#x27;s 1983 debut studio album &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was inspired by bands like the Ramones, the Rolling Stones, and X. Ness considered &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; to be a &quot;regression back to&quot; &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; and believes the album shows Social Distortion going back to the band&#x27;s roots, but still considers the album an evolution because Ness &quot;had to dig really deep&quot;, citing songs like &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; and &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; as examples of this. He says those two songs &quot;deal with sin and redemption, inner conflict, good and bad.&quot;

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
===Musical style===

&quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; shows the band taking a break from the rock and roll and country-inspired style of previous Social Distortion albums by instead featuring a pure hardcore punk style bearing resemblance to &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; and the &quot;Mainliner&quot; compilation. &quot;In Music We Trust&quot; described both the album and Social Distortion&#x27;s music as a whole as street punk. Describing &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; as &quot;heavy hard rock&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that Social Distortion &quot;made a conscious attempt to cash in on the alternative &#x27;revolution&#x27; of the early &#x27;90s.&quot; Nonetheless, Dan McGarry of &quot;The Yale Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;If Ness wanted this record to demonstrate that unique quality that puts Social Distortion above and beyond current &quot;alternative&quot; music, he has succeeded.&quot; Marci Von Savoy of &quot;The Daily Universe&quot; wrote: &quot;The album is reminiscent of the primary punk bands influences: The Ramones, The Clash and the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s punk sound. The album veers far from the alternative trend, which seems to sneak its way into newer punk rock.&quot; iTunes described &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; musical style as a musical style resembling hardcore punk and classic punk rock, writing that &quot;Social Distortion returned to its hardcore roots&quot;. Ness said of the album&#x27;s musical style: &quot;What&#x27;s really ironic about this record is that it probably has more similarities to our first album, from 1983, than any of them. And that was purely unconscious. A lot of those emotions resurfaced. Or I just got in touch with them. I don&#x27;t think they ever go away.&quot; Ness believes &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; was featuring both Social Distortion moving forward and reverting to the band&#x27;s roots. &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; features a hidden track and the hidden track is a cover of the Rolling Stones song &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. Ness said:

===Lyrical themes===

The lyrics on &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; are more personal than lyrics on previous Social Distortion albums. Although a couple of songs are more political or about social issues, the lyrical content on the album are instead personal or introspective. The lyrics often deal with looking back at the past and making changes or improvements in one&#x27;s life. Ness&#x27; struggles in life with drugs, alcohol, and jail inspired the lyrics of the album. Ness says &quot;Dear Lover&quot;, despite the song title, was not necessarily written after a heartbreak. &quot;I already felt like that. I didn&#x27;t even need to get my heart broke to feel that way. What I was doing wasn&#x27;t working. It was almost like saying goodbye to that life because it really wasn&#x27;t bringing me happiness. It&#x27;s something everyone goes through and I kind of wanted to paint a picture, an accurate picture, of that.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Drag Me Down&quot; is about racism and how Ness witnessed it when touring in the United States and seeing it at punk rock concerts, leading to him engaging in physical fights. &quot;Untitled&quot; is about Ness becoming sober and a few older men helped him with it. One of them was a very close friend of his but that friend died. Ness lost four other friends and all of this inspired &quot;Untitled&quot;. &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; is about admitting to mistakes or engaging in morally wrong behavior. Ness explains: &quot;I don&#x27;t know this for sure, but I may have been one of the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; rollers to just say, &#x27;at certain times in my life I was an asshole.&#x27; This job comes a big ego, &#x27;Hey man, I am who I am. Take it, that&#x27;s just what I do. I&#x27;m Mike Ness. Take it or leave it.&#x27; It&#x27;s so easy to pull that card, but it&#x27;s a lot harder to look inward and just go, &#x27;You know what? You&#x27;re right. I was wrong.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Down on the World Again&quot; is &quot;about having the worst day&quot;, according to Ness. He says it is inspired by his painful childhood and how it made him an angry person. He considers it useful to use that anger for songwriting but considers it unhealthy to use anger in one&#x27;s daily life. He says: &quot;I was fighting the world, but I didn&#x27;t even really have a reason.&quot; &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; is about the death of Ness&#x27; grandmother and how being single intensified the grief. Ness&#x27; grandmother died in December 1993. Ness said about &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot;: &quot;My feelings came out more in that song than what I felt in the actual funeral.&quot; &quot;Gotta Know the Rules&quot; is about rules and laws in life and the consequences of disobeying it. Ness elaborated:

&quot;Crown of Thorns&quot; is about repeating the same mistakes in life, expecting different results. Ness elaborated: &quot;I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to find love where I was looking. At some point there&#x27;s an aspect of self care that has to come into play, otherwise it&#x27;s never going to change.&quot; &quot;Pleasure Seeker&quot; is about struggling to make a decision because a decision feels good but one considers it morally wrong. &quot;Down Here With the Rest of Us&quot; is about the level playing field. Ness said: &quot;It&#x27;s a level playing field no matter who you are. We&#x27;re still going to go through pain in life. I think it was kind of a snub at people who think they&#x27;re above that. It&#x27;s like no, we&#x27;re all in this mess together, bro. No one gets out alive.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Reviews and ratings for &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; were generally mixed to positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, however, called the album a &quot;conscious attempt to cash in on the alternative &#x27;revolution&quot; of the early &#x27;90s&quot; and expressed mixed feelings towards the band&#x27;s musical direction, stating, &quot;Underneath the layers of glossy hard rock production, the band still hold fast to some of their punk roots, but too often they sound like a heavy hard rock band. Of course, that commercial sheen is intentional – it&#x27;s the only way they could appeal to the legions of post-grunge alternative fans who appeared since Social Distortion released &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; in 1992.&quot; Chris Moran of Punknews.org praised the album and wrote: &quot;with its passionate lyrics, laced with heavy undertones; this is unquestionable a milestone in the legacy of Social Distortion.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;After more than a decade of hard playing and harder living, Southern California&#x27;s Social Distortion have made their first truly transcendent album.&quot; Roberto Gonzalez of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote: &quot;The album is exhausting. Almost every song kicks with an amazing intensity that will have you immediately hooked.&quot; Ira Robbins of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;the band&#x27;s musical and emotional values are timeless. Like a fist in the face, White Light White Heat White Trash is simple and effective.&quot; Chuck Eddy of &quot;Spin&quot; gave &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; a mixed to negative review and wrote: Ness&#x27;s newfound nasal-flattened attempts at balladic sensitivity are embarrassing&quot;. Sam Dillon of &quot;The Chanticleer&quot; praised the album and wrote: &quot;You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Social D. they&#x27;ve got everything you could ask for in a punk-rock band. They are inventive, individual, and very talented. Go out right now and get this album.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; lyrics, claiming it had a lot of clichés, but praised the album&#x27;s melodies. &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; was ranked at number 41 on &quot;Kerrang!&quot; &quot;50 Greatest Punk Albums Ever&quot;. Some Social Distortion fans were upset when the first single &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; was played on rock radio because they believed punk rock should not be corporate or mainstream. Nonetheless, punk rock fans eventually moved on from this in the early 2000s. Social Distortion continued to be regarded as an important punk band by punk rock fans and the band continued to receive respect and support from punk rock fans. &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; was included in lists of the best albums of 1996 by &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; and other publications.

==Commercial performance, touring, and promotion==

Released on September 17, 1996, &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 30,000 in its first week of release in the United States. The album sold steady weekly sales of 10,000 to 12,000 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, as of December 31, 1998, &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; has sold 277,000 copies in the United States, making it Social Distortion&#x27;s third best-selling album. Ness was confident that the album would have more success than the band&#x27;s self-titled album (1990) and &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992), given that the two previous albums were released before 1994, the year punk rock became mainstream, and given that many more radio stations in the mid-1990s were starting to frequently play punk rock music. Social Distortion planned to tour both inside and outside the United States, given that the band began to attract people outside the United States instead of solely Americans. Social Distortion performed at Warped Tour 1997 along with other bands like Blink-182, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Descendents, Pennywise, the Suicide Machines, Lagwagon, Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, and Limp Bizkit.

The song &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; was released to radio and had a music video created, too. The song had success on rock radio and was played on MTV. The song peaked at number 54 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and remained on the chart for 13 weeks. The song had a lot of chart success on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number 4 and remaining on the chart for 22 weeks. The song also peaked at number 12 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, remaining on there for 19 weeks. &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; also had a music video and was released to radio. The song, however, did not have much success on rock radio and peaked at relatively low positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

<doc id="1089807" wikidata="Q1012038" url="?curid=1089807" title="Alyth">
<text>Alyth () () is a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, northeast of Blairgowrie and about northwest of Dundee. In 2016 the town had an estimated population of 2,400.

First mentioned by name in a 12th-century royal charter of William the Lion, Alyth for many centuries was an important market town and entrepôt on long-established drove roads by which Highland farmers brought their sheep and cattle to lowland markets. Another royal charter in 1488, from James III of Scotland granted Alyth the status of Burgh of Barony entitled to stage markets and fairs. The 17th-century stone Packhorse Bridge still stands in the middle of the town (now pedestrian-only), later joined by two other stone bridges for wheeled traffic, emphasising the settlement&#x27;s importance as a river-crossing.

Agricultural improvements and expanding markets for livestock in the south contributed to Alyth&#x27;s prosperity during the 18th and early 19th centuries, while water-power provided by the Alyth Burn plus, later, steam-power helped the development of a local textile industry specialising in linen. Steam power also brought the Alyth Railway to the town in 1861, accompanied by growth during the later 19th century in retailing along with hotels for holidaymakers, golfers and country sports enthusiasts.

Today, industry has largely gone, but Alyth retains many shops and businesses serving the local area. The town has one of only two museums in Perthshire outside Perth (the other being the Atholl Countylife Museum), as well as a flourishing community of artists and a growing tourism economy.

The boundaries of Alyth Community Council also encompass the hamlet of New Alyth (population c350), about southwest of the town, together with a handful of smaller hamlets and steadings giving a total population of just over 3,000.

==History and archaeology==
In late medieval times Scottish kings used the nearby Forest of Alyth for hunting during their progress around the country. They probably occupied the royal castle of Inverquiech just east of the town (where Edward I of England stayed during his campaign against the Scots in 1296) or the castle of Corb, a royal hunting-lodge in Glenshee in the north-west of the Forest.

 north of Alyth is Bamff House which has been held by the Ramsay family since 1232, when King Alexander II granted the estate to his physician Nessus de Ramsay. Bamff today is an ecotourism destination and, since 2002, home to a reintroduced population of wild beavers. Bamff is currently undergoing a major &#x27;rewilding&#x27; project.
Alyth&#x27;s Pack Bridge (intended to carry packhorses loaded with sidebags or panniers across the burn) is one of the oldest masonry bridges in Scotland and is shown on maps as far back as 1600.

During the years of civil and religious conflict in the mid-17th century, the town was the scene of a dramatic incident known as the ‘Onfall of Alyth’ (28 August 1651). The town had been chosen as the rendezvous for the Committee of Estates, effectively the Scottish government at that time, to organise resistance to the English Parliamentarian invasion forces under General Monck, then besieging Dundee. The committee was betrayed and surprised by a force of Parliamentarian cavalry, and in the fighting that ensued the Earl of Leven (commander of the Scottish forces), the Earl of Crawford, the Earl Marischal, Lord Nairne and other prominent persons, including the Minister of Alyth, Rev. John Rattray, were captured and sent to the Tower of London. This event temporarily extinguished the Scottish Government of the time.

Next to the Pack Bridge, on Pitnacree Street, is the site of one of the town&#x27;s two textile mills. In the 18th century, Alyth became heavily involved in flax processing for the linen textile industry, and spinning and especially hand-loom weaving dominated local employment.
The Alyth Arches, visible from the centre of the town looking north, stand on the site of what is probably Alyth&#x27;s oldest Christian church dating back to the 6th century and dedicated to St Moluag, a contemporary of St. Columba. They formed part of the old parish church, which was abandoned in 1839 when the present fine new church was erected 200 yards to the west. There are also a number of graves, some of which are of notable local people, including James Sandy, the inventor of the invisible hinge.

The current parish church building, completed in 1839 to the design of Edinburgh architect Thomas Hamilton, dominates the skyline of the town. It is Gothic in style, with Romanesque influences, especially in the windows, and has an unusually high spire. Inside the church is the funerary hatchment of Sir George Ramsay (sixth baronet of Bamff) who was killed in a duel at Musselburgh, in April 1790 - one of the last duelling deaths in Scotland. In the church porch is preserved a late 7th-early 8th century Pictish cross-slab, with a decorated cross on one face and a single Pictish symbol (&#x27;double disc and Z-rod&#x27;) on the other. It was discovered in Alyth in 1887 when ground was being levelled in front of the manse.

Alyth retains a physical link with the Napoleonic Wars in the form of a church bell from Brittany. It was captured in 1810 from a French frigate taken by HMS Horatio and was sent as a gift to Alyth by John Warden, a son of the owner of the Bamff Arms, who served on the ship. It remains on display in Alyth Town Hall.

During the Second World War, Alyth formed a close bond with units of the Polish armed forces in exile formed from troops escaping from the Nazi conquest of Poland. There was an active Scottish-Polish Society branch in the town, and several memorials were erected to commemorate the bond.

Across the road from the entrance to the Alyth Arches stands the town&#x27;s old mercat cross, which served as a symbolic representation of the right to hold a regular market or fair. The main annual market was held on St Moluag&#x27;s name day (25 June) every year in the vicinity of the church and nearby Woolmarket.

In the middle of the new Pitcrocknie housing development on the north east edge of the town, is a fine example of a late Neolithic or early Bronze Age Standing Stone. Called the Pitcrocknie Stone it is made out of very fine garnet bearing schist.

To the northeast of the town a hill fort, possibly of Pictish date or earlier, stands atop Barry (or &#x27;barrow&#x27;) Hill. It is considered to be one of the best preserved examples of an enclosed hilltop settlement in Scotland. The remains consist of massive collapsed stone ramparts that take advantage of the topography of the Hill. Local legend connects the fort with King Arthur, and Hector Boece&#x27;s &quot;History and Chronicles of Scotland&quot; claims that Guanora, the Scottish name for Guinevere, Arthur&#x27;s queen, was imprisoned here for a very short time(page 86).

Another nearby early medieval feature is a Pictish &#x27;Class I&#x27; symbol stone in a field on Bruceton Farm somewhat to the east of Alyth. The southeast face of this slab is incised with two Pictish symbols - an arch with traces of internal ornament above a finely scrolled Pictish beast - and is one of relatively few likely still to be in its original position. It may have marked an ancient burial.

===Archaeological excavation of a souterrain - Shanzie Farm===

A late British Iron Age souterrain was excavated by a team of Headland Archaeology in Shanzie Farm, c 3.5. north-east of Alyth. The underground structure was roughly C-shaped in plan and measured c 35 metres in length. There was a single chamber c 5m long and an entrance to the south-east. For the most part, the souterrain had been badly plough truncated and the walls survived as a single course. The northern terminal of the souterrain was better preserved, where 3-4 courses of wall survive. The chamber here narrowed and had been filled with rubble to a depth. The walls also started to corbell inwards indicating this was originally a stone-capped structure rather than timber roofed. No evidence of an associated settlement or any other surface features were identified; these have undoubtedly been lost to the plough. The structure is typical of the &#x27;southern Pictland group&#x27;. The souterrain had clearly been broken into during the Victorian period, but also, during medieval times. Finds included several types of late prehistoric pottery, a fragment of probable Roman pottery, an amber ring, a pair of tweezers, a brooch or clasp, two copper alloy rings and a fragment from a quern stone. The souterrain was partially backfilled allowing visitors to see the structure in plan.

==Governance==
Alyth lies within the Perth &amp; Kinross council area of eastern central Scotland. The town is the second largest settlement within Ward 2 (Strathmore) of Perth &amp; Kinross Council, which is currently (2020) represented by four councillors - two Conservative, one SNP and one Liberal Democrat. Alyth lies within the Perth and North Perthshire constituency of the UK Parliament and the Perthshire North constituency of the Scottish Parliament.

In 1488, King James III made Alyth a Burgh of Barony, a status it retained until 1834 when it became a Police burgh with its own law enforcement and other functions under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1833. In 1624, the lands around Alyth passed from the Lindsay Earls of Crawford into the hands of the local Ogilvy family, and the first Earl of Airlie acquired the feudal superiority of the burgh. Baron Ogilvy of Alith and Lintrathen remains a subsidiary title of the Earls of Airlie. Throughout these centuries, Alyth was a distinct parish within the Scottish local government system, situated mostly within the historic county of Perthshire but also partly within Forfarshire until 1891 when, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, it was moved wholly within Perthshire. In 1894, Alyth became a civil parish and later, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929, a &#x27;small burgh&#x27; following the abolition of Scotland&#x27;s parish councils. Almost 80 years later, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 created Alyth Community Council with boundaries taking in the minor settlements of Tullymurdoch and Bamff to the north, Shanzie to the east, and New Alyth, Balhary and Leitfie to the south.

==Geography==
Alyth lies north of Edinburgh and north of London. The town straddles the burn which bears its name, at the point where the burn descends from the Perthshire Highlands to the lowland Vale of Strathmore. Most of the town lies in a shallow, sheltered basin around above sea-level, nestled under the Hill of Alyth (970 feet or 295 metres) which is part of the southern edge of the Perthshire Highlands. The underlying geology is Devonian-age Old Red Sandstone ( 400 million years old) overlain by glacial deposits left behind by the Pleistocene ice ages. Alyth lies just a few miles southeast of the Highland Boundary Fault which divides the Scottish Highlands from the Scottish Lowlands.

The Alyth Burn bisects the town and is crossed by two road bridges and four footbridges, including the 17th-century Packhorse Bridge. Alyth&#x27;s built environment comprises the mediaeval street pattern northeast of the burn where the ancient drove roads converge on the river crossing, and the more planned nineteenth-century street grid to the south and southwest of the crossings. The town is the only significant built-up area within the Alyth Community Council boundaries, most of which is upland pasture and grouse moor or lowland arable land. Three golf courses occupy a significant area of land to the south and east of the town. Apart from the extension of the golf courses, land-use around Alyth has changed only marginally in the past 80 years.

===Den of Alyth===

The Den of Alyth is a wooded gorge lying on either side of the Alyth Burn northwest of the village. Just under of the Den are designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), important for its upland mixed ash woodland. It is also part of the River Tay Special Area of Conservation, designated for its importance to Atlantic Salmon, otter and various species of lamprey. Alyth Den includes a number of abandoned quarries which provided much of the stone for buildings within the town in earlier times. The Den was gifted to the town by the Earl of Airlie in 1923. Today it is a popular destination for walkers, cyclists and naturalists.

==Demography==
According to Scotland&#x27;s Census 2022, the population of the civil parish of Alyth was 3,046, split 48.8% male, 51.2% female. The age distribution of Alyth&#x27;s population differs somewhat from Scotland, with 14.1% aged under 15 or under (Scotland 16.4%), 56.5% aged 16–64 (Scotland 63.6%), and 29.4% aged 65 or older (Scotland 20%). 

Just over 98% of Alyth&#x27;s population were white Scottish or other British in 2022, compared with just under 93% for Scotland overall. Economically active people aged over 16 made up 53.6% of the population (Scotland 56.8%), with 21.4% retired (Scotland 23.3%) and 1.4% unemployed (Scotland 7.6%) and 2% recorded as full-time students (Scotland 4%.

==Economy==
Tourism accommodation, construction, retail, property, education and the motor trades are the main employment sectors, with smaller but still significant proportions in the arts, business admin and health. About 36% of the working population commute more than 5 km, with Dundee, Blairgowrie and Perth being the main destinations.

Alyth has slightly fewer jobs per head of population than similar towns and saw a small decline (-4%) in the number of jobs between 2009 and 2014. Just over 50% of the adult population are employees, just under 10% self-employed, and a little over 20% are retired. Over 70% of jobs are full-time, and almost 30% part-time.

Alyth has a more diverse retail sector and more people per shop than similar towns in Scotland, and also more tourist beds per head of population.

==Culture and community==

In 2021, Alyth Development Trust and other groups in the town carried out a major consultation on developing a Community Action Plan to identify and prioritise new initiatives that the people of the town wanted to see implemented. Several hundred responses were received and the results were collated into a five-year vision for the town, which was launched in March 2022

===Culture===
Alyth is part of the Cateran Ecomuseum, a new &#x27;museum without walls&#x27; launched in 2019. Set across 1,000 square kilometres of eastern Perthshire and western Angus, all its sites are outside. It is Scotland&#x27;s second ecomuseum and the only one on the mainland.

The Alyth Museum is run by Perth Museum and is open from May through September. It exhibits pictures and objects reflecting life as it was in and around Alyth and is also the new home of the Story Box archive, where visitors can listen to the voices and stories of Alyth told by the folk of the town. The museum offers access to the Alyth Arches.

There is an active Alyth Family History Project, based at the Parish Church since 2009, which has assembled a large archive of photographs and genealogical records.

The Alyth &amp; District Agricultural Show takes place annually each June.

&quot;Alyth Creates&quot; is the town&#x27;s annual arts festival, run by Alyth Arts &amp; Crafts Guild.

A golf club was established in Alyth in 1894. The original nine-hole course was designed by Old Tom Morris of St. Andrews and was modified and extended to 18 holes by James Braid in 1934. Alyth Golf Club had its own halt on the Alyth railway branch line between 1861 and 1951. A further two golf clubs have opened since, the Strathmore Golf Centre (1986) with an 18- and a nine-hole course, and the 18-hole Glenisla Club in 1992. The Glenisla Club closed in 2016 with half the course being sold off for housing development and the other half being taken over by Alyth Golf Club to create a new nine-hole course alongside its existing 18-hole course.

The Alyth Voice is a free monthly community magazine produced and distributed by volunteers, launched in May 1997.

===Community facilities===
Alyth Town Hall is managed along with two other public halls in Alyth by the Alyth Halls Committee operating under a Constitution &amp; Management Agreement with Perth &amp; Kinross Council. The people of Alyth began raising money to build ‘a handsome town hall’ in 1884. The foundation stone was laid by the Earl of Airlie on 2 September 1886 and Alyth Town Hall opened on 29 April 1887. Designed by Andrew Heiton of Perth, The Hall is built from local redstone with white freestone at all the corners and windows.

Alyth has a public library, run by Perth &amp; Kinross Council.

Health and medical services in Alyth are provided by NHS Scotland via Alyth Health Centre. There is also a dental practice operating as Infinityblu Dental Care.

The Diamond Jubilee Park, containing a recreation ground and children&#x27;s play park, was gifted to the people of Alyth by the then Earl of Airlie to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. It includes a football pitch which is home to Alyth Amateur Football Club. The park is managed by Perth &amp; Kinross Council. In 2022, a community initiative raised £60,000 to build a new 665-metre multi-user path around the Park. Nearby, on the bank of Alyth Burn, is Mill Street Park containing another play-park for young children.
Millhaugh, a former sawmill and industrial site on the banks of the Alyth Burn, was acquired by Alyth Development Trust on behalf of the community in 2024 and converted into an outdoor space for community events.

There is an extensive network of &#x27;core footpaths&#x27; in and around Alyth designated by Perth &amp; Kinross Council, and maintained in large part by the Alyth Path Network – a group of volunteers dedicated to maintaining and promoting local country paths.

Alyth Hill is owned by the Scottish Government. It is mostly open to the public and managed by Forestry Scotland. An active voluntary group, the Alyth Hill Users&#x27; Group, represents the community&#x27;s interests on the Hill, managing both the Community Orchard they established in 2011 and the Alyth Community Woodland established by the Forestry Commission in 2007.

===Religion===
Alyth has three churches: Alyth Parish Church (Church of Scotland), completed in 1839; St Ninian&#x27;s Church (Scottish Episcopal Church), completed in 1856; and St Luan&#x27;s Church (Catholic Church in Scotland).

==Landmarks==

Alyth Parish Church (completed in 1839) is notable for its unusually high steeple, visible from many parts of the town and from the roads and fields surrounding it. 
The Church houses a rare clock made by Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, maker of clocks in many royal palaces and one of the leading horologists of the early nineteenth century. The Alyth clock, one of only two known Vulliamy clocks in Scotland, was installed in 1840 along with a bell cast at Thomas Mears&#x27; Whitechapel Foundry, where Big Ben was also cast.

The Alyth Arches (see History and Archaeology section above) are also a prominent landmark visible from the centre of the town. The grand Alyth Town Hall on Albert Street was built in 1887. Balhary House, south of Alyth, is a Grade A-listed late Georgian country house. The Hill of Alyth and Barry Hill dominate the town to the northwest and north.

There are several war memorials in the town: the main war memorial on the Market Muir at the southern end of Airlie Street commemorates 119 local men who died in World War I, together with 33 who died in World War II and one who died in the Falklands Campaign. Located beside this is the memorial to Alfred Anderson, who was the last surviving Scottish veteran of WW1, last survivor of the Christmas Truce of 1914, and Scotland&#x27;s oldest man when he died in 2005. In the Market Square, there is a memorial to three local men who died in the Second Boer War. There are a number of other war memorials inside Alyth Parish Church, St Ninian&#x27;s Church and other buildings in the town.
 north of Alyth, on the River Isla, is the spectacular waterfall of Reekie Linn, from the Gaelic for &quot;misty pool&quot;. The River Isla has carved a 45-metre-deep gorge down from the hard igneous rock of the Highlands to the softer sandstone of Strathmore, creating two falls of 6 metres and 18 metres. When the River Isla is in spate the two falls merge to create a single drop of 24 metres. At the base of the waterfall is a dark cave called Black Dub, where legend has it an outlaw once hid until the devil appeared before him in the form of a giant black dog. The outlaw was so scared that he turned himself in the next day.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Alyth lies just north of the junction of the A926 (connecting Blairgowrie and Kirriemuir) and the B954 (connecting Dundee and Glenisla). The B952 loops through the town itself, from the A925/B954 junction back to the B954 just east of the town.

===Railway===
Alyth was the terminus of the Alyth Railway, a branch from the Scottish Midland Junction Railway. Alyth railway station opened in 1861 and closed to passenger traffic in 1951, although goods traffic continued until 1965. The site of the former railway station, now occupied by housing, is remembered in the name Mart Street, where livestock auctions were held after they moved from the Market Muir. The nearest ScotRail stations nowadays are Dundee railway station and Perth railway station (Scotland).

===Cycling===
Alyth is part of the Strathmore Cycle Network, a project to develop a series of dedicated cycle tracks connecting three local towns via country lanes and specially-built paths avoiding main roads.

=== Buses ===
Stagecoach East Scotland operate services 57 &amp; 57A via Alyth to Dundee, Blairgowrie and Perth. They run hourly everyday by double decker buses. The vehicles on the Stagecoach routes have recently been upgraded with a £1,000,000 investment in new buses. JP Coaches also operate services in the area. Service 128 of theirs runs to Kirriemuir two-hourly between Monday and Saturday.

==Education==
Alyth has a primary school with around 170 pupils. Alyth High School (built in 1885) catered for pupils up to fourth year until it was closed in 1994, when all pupils were moved to Blairgowrie High School or Webster&#x27;s High School situated in nearby Kirriemuir. The Primary School was rebuilt and extended in 2018.

<text>Komeda is a Swedish pop/indie band from Umeå. They were initially called Cosma Komeda, named in honour of composer Vladimir Cosma and jazz musician and composer Krzysztof Komeda. The band started in the mid-1980s as a post-punk band influenced by bands such as Can, Devo, and The Velvet Underground, and by film soundtracks. Their first public appearance was in 1991 as a pit band for a Buster Keaton festival in their home town of Umeå. Forming as a quartet of schoolfriends, Komeda consisted of vocalist Lena Karlsson, guitarist (Lars) Henrik Andersson (Ray Wonder) (in 1994 replaced by Mattias Norlander from the band Blithe), bassist Marcus Holmberg and Holmberg&#x27;s brother Jonas on drums. They increased in popularity, especially in the US, following tours with Beck and Ben Folds Five and regular MTV appearances. Reluctant to move permanently to the US to pursue further success, and grieving from the loss of their parents, the band went into hiatus following 1998&#x27;s What Makes It Go? although they continued to make music for theatre during this time.

During 2001 the band was reduced to a trio with the departure of Norlander as he left to work as a software engineer in Stockholm. In 2002, Marcus Holmberg joined guitarists Frans Perris and Magnus Kollberg to form the band The Most. In 2010 Jonas Holmberg launched his new project Gilles &amp; Felix, an experimental audio/visual performance. Marcus Holmberg now lives in Stockholm and works on various music projects, including playing bass in the bands Woodlands and Dewed .

Komeda provided the score music for the animated film &quot;Pettson och Findus – Kattonauten&quot; (2000). 
They have also recorded under the name Projektor 7, adding music to silent movies.

In 2006, &quot;Check It Out&quot;, a hidden track from the &quot;Kokomemedada&quot; album, was used in commercials for Old Navy. Simultaneously, the song &quot;Out from the Rain&quot; from the same album was used in a commercial for &quot;&quot; on the Nintendo DS.

<text>Embraco is a manufacturer of compressors for refrigeration systems that was founded in 1971 in Brazil. Embraco produces hermetic compressors, condensing units, and sealed units, for domestic and commercial use.

Its headquarters and main factory is in Joinville, Santa Catarina in the southern region of Brazil. Embraco also has factories in China, Mexico and Slovakia, as well as business offices in Turin (Italy), Moscow (Russia) and Atlanta (United States).

Embraco employs approximately 10,000 people worldwide. The firm invests heavily in product design and manufacturing, and supplies large international household refrigeration OEMs as well as the biggest manufacturers of commercial refrigeration equipment.

== History ==
Embraco was founded in Joinville, in the Southern region of Brazil, in 1971. It was founded to supply the Brazilian refrigeration industry which, until then, relied entirely on imported compressors. A few years after its inauguration it began to export to other countries in the Americas.

In the 1980s, the sales and distribution structure reached over 80 countries. Anticipating a globalized economy, the company decided to set up production bases overseas.

In 2014, Embraco announced linear compressors which were claimed to be more compact than other compressors and to be oil-free.

In 2018, Embraco closed its factory in Turin and moved it to Slovakia, albeit leaving a business office in Turin.

In April 2018, Whirlpool Corporation entered into an agreement with Nidec Corporation to sell Embraco for $1.08 billion.
Headquartered in Brazil, Embraco had been a Whirlpool Corporation business unit since 1994.

<text>Henri Cornet (born Henri Jardry; 4 August 1884 – 18 March 1941) was a French cyclist who won the 1904 Tour de France. He is its youngest winner, just short of his 20th birthday.

==Background==

Cornet was born in the Pas-de-Calais region of northwest France and was registered at birth under his mother&#x27;s name. Then he was adopted by his stepfather, who gave him the name Jardry. It is not known why he changed his name from Henri Jardry to Henri Cornet. He was a talented amateur—he won Paris-Honfleur in 1903—but little known beyond northern France and in Belgium when he entered the second Tour de France in 1904. It was his first year as a professional. The organizer, Henri Desgrange, promoted his unknown competitors to readers of &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, the newspaper he edited, by giving them nicknames. He called Cornet &quot;Le Rigolo&quot;, or &quot;the joker&quot;, for his sense of fun. He is described as cheerful, with wide-spaced eyes, a nose described as trumpet-like, and a generous mouth that spread easily into a smile.

==Tour de France==

The Tour de France had proved a success when the first race was run in 1903 and both the competition between riders and the passion of the fans who supported them rose to sometimes dangerous proportions. Riders took trains and lifts in cars or had themselves towed by drivers; a rider called Pierre Chevalier was repeatedly left exhausted in the darkness of night only to reappear in the race; the 1903 winner, Maurice Garin received food from the race director, Géo Lefèvre when others were denied. Fans beat up riders on the col de la République outside St-Étienne and dispersed only when Garin fired his gun.

Other spectators threw nails on the road on the last day and Cornet rode the last 40 km on flat tires. After many complaints about widespread cheating, the top four finishers were disqualified by the French cycling union. It declared Cornet the winner although he had taken three hours more than Garin, the winner and receiving an official warning that suggests his own conduct was less than pristine. Desgrange said he would never run the race again.

Cornet is the Tour&#x27;s youngest winner at .

==After 1904==

Henri Cornet never had further success in the Tour, dropping out in 1905 on the fourth day. He won Paris–Roubaix and came second in Bordeaux–Paris in 1906, and came eighth in the 1908 Tour de France, in which he won a one-lap time-trial held at the end of the race in the Parc des Princes. It was a demonstration race and did not count for the overall result of the Tour.

He was a fluid rider talented at repeated short efforts.

==Retirement and death==

Cornet rode his last Tour de France in 1912, finishing 28th. He had repeated health problems, however, which brought his career to an end. He stopped racing with the start of World War I. He retired to work in the cycle business (&quot;négoce cycliste&quot;) and died after a hospital operation at 56. A road in Prunay-le-Gillon is named after him.

<doc id="1089817" wikidata="Q385010" url="?curid=1089817" title="Knight banneret">
<text>A knight banneret, sometimes known simply as banneret, was a medieval knight who led a company of troops during time of war under his own banner (which was square-shaped, in contrast to the tapering standard or the pennon flown by the lower-ranking knights) and was eligible to bear supporters in English heraldry. The military rank of a knight banneret was higher than a knight Bachelor (who fought under another&#x27;s banner), but lower than an earl or duke.

Under English custom the rank of knight banneret could only be conferred by the sovereign on the field of battle. There were some technical exceptions to this; when his standard was on the field of battle he could be regarded as physically present though he was not. His proxy could be regarded as a sufficient substitution for his presence.

The wife of a banneret was styled as banneress.

==Origins==
There were no standing armies in the middle ages (except the military orders). Though modern scholarship has had a lot to say about the varied means by which medieval princes raised their forces, the obligation of a vassal to serve on horseback either in person and (for some) with a contingent raised by his own means is still seen as providing the core of any army of the time. The &#x27;feudal&#x27; nature of even this part of the medieval army has been qualified by some, in that many 11th and 12th-century lords gathered under their banners extra knights available for hire for a campaign, men who were disparaged at the time as &#x27;mercenaries&#x27;. Even so the &#x27;mesnie&#x27; (retained military household) was the elite core of any great lord&#x27;s following in war and in tournament, and a sign also of his power and dignity. By the early 12th century lords in the field distinguished their personal retinue by a square banner which came to feature the heraldic device associated with their noble lineage. The Old French word for it is &#x27;baniere&#x27;, derived from the lord&#x27;s power of command, called in French his &#x27;ban&#x27;. It literally meant &#x27;token of authority&#x27;.

The idea of the banneret as a distinct and superior category of knight is seen as a consequence of the fact that the great lord who did not possess a hereditary title (like count or duke) found himself on the same social level as the subordinate and dependent knights of his retinue. This became a particular issue in the 12th century, with the growth of the aristocratic tournament culture in north east France and the western Empire. One uncomfortable consequence of this for the untitled lord was the rise in standing of the common knight towards noble status. A solution was to exalt magnate knighthood to a level above that of common knights, and identify it with the banner that a lord could carry, but not a common knight. The first indication of the rank was in the tournament roll compiled after the great royal festival at Lagny-sur-Marne in 1179 where the knights &#x27;carrying a banner&#x27; were distinguished from the rest. The title &#x27;banneret&#x27; (Latin &quot;banneretus&quot;, &quot;vexillifer&quot;; Middle French: &quot;banerez&quot;) was fully established as a military and social rank by the mid 13th century. Initially the term could be applied collectively to all noblemen qualified to raise a banner (including counts and dukes), but before the end of the 13th century it came to be used exclusively as a senior rank of knight or lesser magnate. The term originated in Francophone aristocratic culture in the later 12th century, but was adopted into other cultures. It was adopted into Flemish by 1300 as &#x27;baenrots&#x27;, a word explained as from &quot;baan&quot; (command) and &quot;rot&quot; (troop). The word was taken into Middle High German as &quot;baenritz&quot; or &quot;bannerheer&quot; and was current in the principalities of the Western Empire in the 14th century.

There was in the 14th century a tension between the evolving title of &#x27;baron&#x27; as a hereditary dignity and &#x27;banneret&#x27; which could be applied to the same lord. It was resolved in part by employing &#x27;baron&#x27; for him in a civil context and &#x27;banneret&#x27; in a military context, where bannerets could claim a higher rate of pay on campaign than common knights. In the work of the great English antiquaries of the 17th century the banneret is understood as a medieval curiosity though they gave rise to the idea that bannerets were the origin of King James I&#x27;s order of the baronet. John Selden, however, points out that the &quot;old stories&quot; often have &quot;baronetti&quot; as synonyms for &quot;bannereti&quot; and is careful to say that &quot;banneret hath no relation to this later title [of baronet]&quot;. The last authentic instance of the creation of knights banneret was by King Charles I to several men at the Battle of Edgehill (1642) including Thomas Strickland of Sizergh for gallantry, and John Smith for rescuing the royal standard from the enemy.

==Later history==
Whether any further bannerets were granted is debated by historians. George Cokayne notes in &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; (1913) that King George II revived the order when he created sixteen knights bannerets on the field of the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, and although his source for this, a diary entry by Gertrude Savile, states &quot;This honour had been laid aside since James I, when Baronets were instituted&quot;, which contradicts other sources, a news magazine published in the same year as the battle recorded the honours. Several sources, including Edward Brenton (1828) and William James (1827), record that captains Trollope and Fairfax and were honoured with bannerets by King George III for their actions during the Battle of Camperdown (1797). However, these awards were never recorded in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; and is much more likely that these knighthoods, which first appear in formal records in December 1797 without their nature being specified, were as knights bachelor.

Though the title had long fallen into disuse, bannerets and their sons continued to be listed in the table of precedence until at least as late as 1870; those created by the sovereign under the Royal Standard in wartime rank above baronets, whereas those knights banneret not so created by the sovereign in person rank directly below baronets.

On page 364 of the 1990 edition of &quot;Dod&#x27;s Parliamentary Companion&quot;, its table of precedence, which includes various long-vacant dignities, has in position 99 &quot;Knights Banneret, created under the royal standard in open war, the Sovereign or the Prince of Wales being present&quot; and in position 104 &quot;Knights Banneret, provided they be not made in the manner described at No. 99. This position was allotted to such as were created by the commanders of armies in the king&#x27;s name on the open field of battle.&quot; The former class of Knights Banneret thus rank below Judges of the High Court of Justice and above younger sons of viscounts and the latter class below baronets and above &quot;Knights of the Thistle, when below the degree of a baron&quot;.

In the 1920s, the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (later the National Tuberculosis Association and now the American Lung Association) in the United States used the Knight Banneret symbolism in its TB efforts. Knight Banneret pins were issued.

==Royal Air Force==
Following the creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918, unique names were devised for most of its commissioned officer ranks. This was reputedly a result of an objection by the Royal Navy to other services adopting any name for a commissioned rank that was already used by the RN. In addition, the RAF ranks also served to distinguish the new service from the British Army and Royal Navy, and to identify individual officers as belonging to the RAF.

&quot;Banneret&quot; was among the names proposed for the RAF equivalent to a naval captain or an army colonel. However, this proposal was rejected and the name group captain was instead adopted.

<doc id="1089826" wikidata="Q4120352" url="?curid=1089826" title="Bristol International Balloon Fiesta">
<text>The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta is an annual four day free festival of hot air ballooning in Bristol, England. Teams from the UK and other parts of the world bring their hot air balloons to the site and participate in mass ascents where as many as 100 balloons may launch at a time.
==History==
The event was first held in 1979, building on a strong local tradition of ballooning in and around Bristol, stretching back to the eighteenth century. The festival is now one of the largest in Europe. It is common to have crowds of over 100,000 on each of the four days of the festival. It takes place in a large country estate, Ashton Court. Mass launches are made twice a day, at 6am and 6pm, subject to weather conditions.

The balloon makers Cameron Balloons are near to the fiesta site, in Bedminster, and make many of the special shaped balloons, which have included Rupert the Bear, The Scottish Piper, Bertie Bassett, the Tesco Trolley, Stuart the Minion, and the BBC One Balloon. Many shapes have also attended the fiesta from abroad, over the years a UFO and a beaver have travelled from the US, a kiwi bird from New Zealand, and an upside down balloon from the Netherlands.

In the past, the fiesta used to be held in the second week of September, but due to cancellations of flights and the muddy ground because of bad weather, it has been moved in the start of August. This has had a great effect as more flights manage to fly; cancellations are now normally due to high winds.
In 2003, the weight of crowds returning from the Balloon Fiesta and Ashton Court festival put such a great strain on the Clifton Suspension Bridge that it was decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, during these events from 2004 onwards.

In recent years, the event has diversified to include small scale air displays, attracting the likes of The Blades, Typhoon display team and the Red Arrows.

On 10 August 2013, they broke a balloon fiesta record after 74 balloons landed in one field near the former Somerdale Factory in Keynsham.
 The record was then broken a year later, when 90 balloons again landed in the former Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory on 9 August.

The Balloon Fiesta was cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, to avoid gathering crowds at Ashton Court. However, there were mass ascent events for people to watch from a distance, with a one-off &quot;Fiesta Flypast&quot; in 2020, and a &quot;Fiesta Fortnight&quot; of ascents in 2021.

==Attractions==

One popular attraction is the night glow, when balloons are inflated and glow to music after dark. These are held on the opening Thursday night at approximately 9:30pm, followed by a fireworks display. There is another night glow at the same time followed by the fireworks on the Saturday night. Some people see these as the highlight of the fiesta.

<text>Auchtermuchty ( ; , &#x27;upland of the pigs/boar&#x27;) is a town in Fife, Scotland. It is beside Pitlour Hill and north of Glenrothes.

==History==

Until 1975 Auchtermuchty was a royal burgh, established under charter of King James V in 1517. There is evidence of human habitation in the area dating back over 2,000 years, and the Romans are known to have established a camp in the southeast corner of the town. In the past, the linen industry was a major source of work in the town, but in the early 18th century the firm of John White was established, bringing the town its first foundry (there were two eventually). The town also had a distillery - Stratheden Whisky Distillery, set in the town centre - from 1829 to 1926, but it had to close when Prohibition in the United States drastically reduced the demand for its products. The town nowadays is a quiet but thriving community, situated in the Scottish countryside, where there are several local recreational footpaths. There is a modest range of local industry, but most people of working age travel out of the town for employment.

There was a town festival held each year in August, but this has now ceased.

As in many parts of Fife, there is much evidence of the impact of both World Wars on the village. To the North East of the town, a concrete observation platform was built on what is thought to be a long used site of strategical and defensive importance, as it overlooks the entire village and the remains of earlier walls and structures are evident. During the Second World War the flat farmland of the glacial valley in which Auchtermuchty sits made a prime target for glider landings in the event of an invasion, and it may still be possible to see the remains of trenches dug and obstacles built to prevent this, though these have largely been erased by farming throughout Fife.

==Buildings==

The old part of the town is based around a hill. The twisting streets here have a wealth of buildings dating from the 17th and 18th century, centred on a medieval peel tower (now forming part of the town library).

The church (on the east side of the hill) is a simple Georgian box chapel, but with an interesting double bell within its western bellcote. Gravestones date back to the 17th century. A more modern cemetery dating from around 1910 lies to the south-east of the town, partly concealed by industrial units. Maps from the mid-19th century show no less than five churches in use at one time.

The town war memorial is of note, and is an unusual design by the architect Reginald Fairlie, portraying a Scottish soldier with head bowed, rather than the triumphant and victorious figures of other memorials in neighbouring villages, reflecting the huge loss of the village during the Great War.

==Amenities==
Auchtermuchty Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1902. The club ceased to exist following WW2.

==Cultural references==
Auchtermuchty was the setting for The Wife of Auchtermuchty, a comic Scots poem of the late Middle Ages.
The town was used as the location for Tannochbrae in the 1990s ITV series &quot;Dr. Finlay&quot;.

The town&#x27;s church is mentioned in James Hogg&#x27;s &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot;, as was Herald Law, a hill to the north if the village, in an area known historically as &quot;The Holy Land&quot;.

In &quot;The Family Ness&quot; theme song, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find A Nessie In The Zoo&quot;, the refrain states &quot;You can go to Auchtermuchty and to Drumnadrochit too, but you&#x27;ll never find a Nessie in the zoo&quot;.

Auchtermuchty was often referred to by John Junor in the Sunday Express: &quot;John Junor&#x27;s editorial approach was simple: articulate the fears and preoccupations of Middle England and liven them up with dollops of hokey Scottish folk wisdom. In his column for the paper, Junor lit upon the small Scottish town of Auchtermuchty and made it into his own personal Brigadoon, a place of solemn courtesy to one&#x27;s betters and implacable hostility to outsiders.&quot;

Auchtermuchty is mentioned in a song from the album &quot;Legends from Beyond the Galactic Terrorvortex&quot; by symphonic metal band Gloryhammer.

<text>Théophile Alexandre Steinlen (November 10, 1859 – December 13, 1923), was a Swiss-born French Art Nouveau painter and printmaker. He was politically engaged and collaborated with the anarchist and socialist press.

==Biography==
Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Steinlen studied at the University of Lausanne before taking a job as a designer trainee at a textile mill in Mulhouse in eastern France. In his early twenties he was still developing his skills as a painter when he and his wife Emilie were encouraged by the painter François Bocion to move to the artistic community in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris. Once there, Steinlen was befriended by the painter Adolphe Willette who introduced him to the artistic crowd at Le Chat Noir that led to his commissions to do poster art for the cabaret owner/entertainer Aristide Bruant and for other commercial enterprises.
In the early 1890s, Steinlen&#x27;s paintings of rural landscapes, flowers, and nudes were being shown at the Salon des Indépendants. His 1895 lithograph titled &quot;Les Chanteurs des Rues&quot; was the frontispiece to a work entitled &quot;Chansons de Montmartre&quot; published by Éditions Flammarion with sixteen original lithographs that illustrated the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; songs of Paul Delmet. Five of his posters were published in &quot;Les Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche&quot;.

His permanent home, Montmartre and its environs, was a favorite subject throughout Steinlen&#x27;s life and he often painted scenes of some of the harsher aspects of life in the area. His daughter, Colette, was featured in much of his work. In addition to paintings and drawings, he also did sculpture on a limited basis, most notably figures of cats that he had great affection for as seen in many of his paintings. Steinlen included cats in many of his illustrations, and even published a book of his designs, &quot;Dessins Sans Paroles Des Chats&quot;.

Steinlen became a regular contributor to &quot;Le Rire&quot; and &quot;Gil Blas&quot; magazines plus numerous other publications including &quot;L&#x27;Assiette au Beurre&quot; and &quot;Les Humouristes&quot;, a short-lived magazine he and a dozen other artists jointly founded in 1911. Between 1883 and 1920, he produced hundreds of illustrations, a number of which were done under a pseudonym so as to avoid political problems because of their harsh criticisms of social ills. His art influenced the work of other artists, including Pablo Picasso.

Théophile Steinlen died in 1923 in Paris and was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in Montmartre. Today, his works can be found at many museums around the world including at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., United States. A stone monument by Pierre Vannier was created for Steinlen in 1936; it is located in Square Joël Le Tac in Paris.

<doc id="1089840" wikidata="Q6258580" url="?curid=1089840" title="John Sparkes">
<text>John Sparkes (born 6 January 1954) is a Welsh comedian and actor. He portrayed Barry Welsh, presenter of the HTV Wales series &quot;Barry Welsh Is Coming&quot;. He has also had major roles in &quot;Naked Video&quot;, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot;, and &quot;Jeff Global&#x27;s Global Probe&quot;, and is the narrator of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;.

==Early life==
Sparkes was born on 6 January 1954 in Swansea, Wales. After working, firstly at Lloyds Bank in Mumbles and then as a teacher, in the 1980s he turned to comedy and moved to London, performing on the alternative cabaret circuit with comedians such as Alexei Sayle, Jo Brand, Paul Merton, and Rik Mayall.

==Television comedy career==
===&quot;Naked Video&quot; and &quot;Absolutely&quot;===
Sparkes starred in the sketch show &quot;Naked Video&quot;, where he played Siadwel, the geeky South Wales poet who wore an anorak and glasses. The character also appeared when Sparkes was part of the BBC Radio 4 comedy programme &quot;Bodgers, Banks &amp; Sparkes&quot;.

He was one of the team behind the Channel 4 sketch show &quot;Absolutely&quot;, which ran for four years between 1989 and 1993. Following an award-winning radio special, a new series for BBC Radio 4 was commissioned for broadcast in September 2015.

===Barry Welsh===
&quot;Barry Welsh Is Coming&quot; was a long-running comedy series for HTV Wales. As well as playing Barry Welsh, the hapless host of a chat show, Sparkes also plays other characters within the programme, such as pub singer Gwyn, old Mr Ffff and Fishguard news reporter Hugh Pugh. Although the series ended in 2004, it returned in 2007 for a series of one-off specials.

Throughout its original run, the series also won four BAFTA Cymru awards for Best Light Entertainment.

==Children&#x27;s television==
Sparkes provides the voice of the narrator and some other characters in the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;, in which the voice of fellow &quot;Absolutely&quot; star Morwenna Banks is also featured. In &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot; he voices Bitzer the Dog and the Farmer. He also voices Mr Elf and King Marigold in &quot;Ben &amp; Holly&#x27;s Little Kingdom&quot;, Professor von Proton in &quot;The Big Knights&quot;, Steven in &quot;A Town Called Panic&quot;, and the lead character &quot;Fireman Sam&quot; in the 2005 series.

==Radio==
After killing off Siadwel in &quot;Naked Video&quot;, Sparkes revived the character in 2014 for a new series of radio shows for BBC Radio Wales, which was recommissioned a year later.

==Writing==
Sparkes has written and presented three ongoing television series of &quot;Great Pubs of Wales&quot; for ITV Wales. He has voiced the unseen character of archivist Goronwy, in a section of &quot;Wallace and Gromit&#x27;s World of Invention&quot; for BBC One and has written and presented &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, in which he spent the night alone with a camcorder in haunted houses around Wales. He has also co-written and presented &quot;Doug Strong&#x27;s Special Places&quot;, a factual comedy series for ITV Wales and ITV Central.

==Other work==
In 2005, Sparkes performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in &quot;Absolutely Presents John Sparkes and Pete Baikie&quot; with his &quot;Absolutely&quot; colleague Peter Baikie.

For Welsh television, he starred in &quot;Jeff Global&#x27;s Global Probe&quot; (ITV Wales), and he resurrected the character Frank Hovis, originally devised for the &quot;Absolutely&quot; series, in &quot;Pub Quiz&quot; (BBC Wales).

==Personal life==
Sparkes is married to Beverly and they have two grown-up daughters.

<text>Cloth-making was, apart from iron-making, the other large-scale industry carried out on the Weald of Kent and Sussex in medieval times. The ready availability of wool from the sheep of the Romney Marsh, and the immigration from Flanders in the fourteenth century of cloth-workers – places like Cranbrook attracted hundreds of such skilled workers – ensured its place in Kentish industrial history. The industry spread along the Weald, and as far north as Maidstone.

It was helped by the fact that Fuller&#x27;s earth deposits existed between Boxley and Maidstone: it being an essential raw material for de-greasing the wool. At the time the export of it was forbidden, lest it help their rivals.

Once the wool had been carded (to get rid of the tangles) and spun (both these processes could be done in the workpeople&#x27;s own homes), it then required weaving. Since that process required looms and the space to do it, &#x27;clothier&#x27;s halls&#x27; were required. These were, as is shown by the timber-framed clothier&#x27;s hall at Biddenden, often the length of the attics in the master clothier&#x27;s house. After weaving it was fulled (using the Fuller&#x27;s earth), and then dried. Once dry, the cloth was brushed with teasels to get rid of loose threads; and finally the shearman cut off loose and projecting pieces of wool.

Regulations ensured the size and quality of the cloth offered for sale. Although regulation width was normally 63 inches (1.75 yards or 160 cm), Kentish broadcloth was only 58 inches (147 cm) wide. One piece was between 30–34 yards (27.5–31 m); and should weigh 66 pounds (30 kg). Officials known as &#x27;ulnagers&#x27; were employed to pass each piece. The price of Kentish cloth at the start of the 17th century was £12–16 per piece. One yard of cloth would be equal to a farmworker&#x27;s wage for 2–3 weeks.

There is also a clothier&#x27;s house in Cranbrook. It has a separate building to house the looms.

<text>Peter McCallum Dowding SC (born 6 October 1943) is an Australian lawyer and former politician who was the premier of Western Australia from 25 February 1988 until his resignation on 12 February 1990 due to a leadership spill. He was a member of the Parliament of Western Australia from 1980 to 1990 and a member of the Labor Party.

Dowding graduated from the University of Western Australia with a Bachelor of Laws, and he subsequently worked as a solicitor and barrister. In 1980, he was elected to the North Province of the Western Australian Legislative Council, the parliament&#x27;s upper house. He entered the Burke ministry when Labor won the 1983 state election and changed portfolios several times over the ensuing years due to cabinet reshuffles. At the 1986 state election, Dowding transferred to the Legislative Assembly, the parliament&#x27;s lower house, winning the safe seat of Maylands.

In December 1987, Premier Brian Burke announced that he would resign on 25 February 1988. Burke picked Dowding as his preferred replacement, with a secret opinion poll showing that he was the best candidate for the party to choose. After several other contenders dropped out of the contest, Dowding was voted in unanimously as the party&#x27;s leader on 30 December.

Dowding&#x27;s popularity plunged following controversy caused by WA Inc. On 12 February 1990, he resigned as premier and leader of the Labor Party ahead of almost certain defeat in a Labor Party leadership spill. He was succeeded by Carmen Lawrence. Dowding soon resigned from parliament, and went back to practising law. The royal commission into WA Inc was scathing of Dowding, saying that he &quot;presided over a disastrous series of decisions&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Dowding was born on 6 October 1943 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. His parents were Keith McCallum Dowding, a high-profile Presbyterian minister and left-wing political activist, and Marjorie Stuart D&#x27;Arcey, who died of suicide when Peter was eight. He was educated at various schools in Australia and the United Kingdom, including Caulfield Grammar School in Melbourne, Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow, The Scots College in Sydney, and Hale School in Perth, Western Australia. As a teenager, he joined the Labor Party. Keith Dowding was also a member of the Labor Party and had attempted to enter Federal Parliament several times, but he was expelled in the early 1960s for his opposition to the White Australia policy. Dowding earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Western Australia in 1964, and was admitted to the bar in December 1966.

In 1970, Dowding married his first wife, with whom he had two sons. Between 1967 and 1972, he represented over 100 Vietnam War conscientious objectors, successfully defending over 30 of them. He also represented protesters who had been arrested at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt, a U.S.-operated naval base in Exmouth. The case gained notoriety when Dowding proved that the police officers involved in the incident had swapped their name badges to prevent them from being identified. In 1968, Dowding entered into partnership as Paterson and Dowding, where he concentrated on family law, soon becoming the best divorce lawyer in Perth according to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He became a senior partner in 1977 and he sold out of the firm in 1980. From March 1975 until April 1976, Dowding was on the Kalamunda Shire Council, and in 1976 and 1977, he worked as a notary public with the Aboriginal Legal Service in Port Hedland, during which he met his second wife, a Ngarluma woman from Roebourne.

In 1977, Dowding represented defeated Labor Party candidate Ernie Bridge in a landmark case in the Court of Disputed Returns. At the 1977 state election, Bridge was defeated by Liberal candidate Alan Ridge by 93 votes in the electoral district of Kimberley. The Liberal Party had worked to disenfranchise Aboriginal voters, many of whom were illiterate, by having lawyers stand outside polling stations to question their right to vote. The court found that over 90 people were illegally prevented from voting, and so the results were overturned. The resulting 1977 Kimberley state by-election saw Ridge win again. In 1980, he married his second wife, with whom he had one daughter and one son.

==Early political career==
Ahead of the 1980 Western Australian state election, Dowding put himself forward to be the Labor candidate for the North Province, a Legislative Council seat which covered the northern side of the state, including the Pilbara and the Kimberley. With no other Labor members seeking preselection, he was endorsed as the seat&#x27;s Labor candidate. At the election, he beat incumbent Liberal Party candidate John Tozer. Dowding was well supported by the province&#x27;s large Aboriginal population, having promised to help them gain land rights and self-management. His term commenced on 22 May 1980.

Upon Labor&#x27;s victory at the February 1983 state election under Brian Burke, Dowding was made the minister for mines and the minister for fuel and energy. Dowding&#x27;s inclusion in the ministry was a surprise, as he was the only member that was not part of Burke&#x27;s shadow ministry. Dowding was replacing Mike Barnett, who did not nominate himself for the ministry due to family reasons. In 1983, the Department of Mines and the Department of Resource Development merged to form the Department of Minerals and Energy, following a report commissioned by the previous government that was critical of the interdepartmental conflicts which occurred. This necessitated a cabinet reshuffle. On 23 December 1983, Dowding became the minister for planning, the minister for employment and training, and the minister for consumer affairs. At a cabinet reshuffle on 20 December 1984, he relinquished being the minister for planning and he became the minister for industrial relations in addition to being the minister for employment and training, and the minister for consumer affairs.

At the February 1986 state election, Dowding left his Legislative Council seat to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Maylands in a move widely seen as a step towards becoming premier. Maylands was a safe seat for the Labor Party, and was held by the retiring John Harman. Dowding retained the seat for the Labor Party at the election, after which, he stopped being the minister for consumer affairs. In Perth, Dowding lived in the suburb of Mount Lawley. From October 1986, in addition to his two prior ministries, he became the minister assisting the minister for public sector management. He was given the responsibility of implementing the changes recommended in a parliamentary white paper, &quot;Managing change in the public sector&quot;, which included the public sector being more selective with choosing employees, attempting to retain graduates, and cutting back on staff in health. In his role as minister for employment and training, he embarked on a tour of Europe, where he developed an interest in Sweden&#x27;s regulated economy. It was in Stockholm where he met his third wife. He convinced her to move to Australia, and in October 1987, they married at the old Perth Observatory. His positions were renamed to the minister for productivity and employment, and the minister for labour in a March 1987 cabinet reshuffle. He also became the minister for works and services in that reshuffle.

==Premier==
After months of speculation, in December 1987, Burke announced his intention to resign as premier and from parliament on 25 February 1988. Burke had named Dowding as his preferred successor. A secret opinion poll conducted by the Labor Party in March 1987 found that Dowding was the most &quot;electorally acceptable&quot; candidate, however some trade unions and sections of the Labor Party disliked Dowding. Other contenders were David Parker, Bob Pearce, and Julian Grill, however they all pulled out of contention before the 30 December Labor caucus vote due to Burke&#x27;s influence, the opinion poll, and the desire for the party to be united. Dowding was unanimously elected as the leader of the Labor Party and Parker was unanimously elected as deputy leader, replacing Mal Bryce, who had also announced his intention to resign.

Dowding and his ministry were sworn in by Governor Gordon Reid on 25 February 1988. Dowding gave himself the positions of treasurer, minister for productivity, minister for public sector management and minister for women&#x27;s interests. The changes made to cabinet were designed to replace ministers who had accrued controversy in their roles. This meant that Gordon Hill was replaced as the minister for police by Ian Taylor and Pearce was replaced as the minister for education by Carmen Lawrence, a cabinet newcomer.

Dowding was not part of any Labor Party faction. When asked about this, he replied that &quot;my heart beats in the direction of giving Labor the opportunity to govern. Social issues are not the prerogative of the Left. The Left gets sidetracked and the Right gets sidetracked. If my heart beats anywhere, it&#x27;s in the centre.&quot; In 2012, Dowding said in an interview that &quot;I regarded myself as Left but I was in the centre. The Left was right socially and the Right was very right and I did not form allegiances very well.&quot;

The March 1988 by-elections in the electoral districts of Ascot and Balga had swings away from the Labor Party of 14.8 percent and 21.3 percent respectively, which Dowding blamed on both the state and federal governments. The high informal vote caused the Dowding government to reverse the Burke government&#x27;s 1987 addition of ticket voting in the Legislative Assembly.

An opinion poll released in April 1988 found that 48 percent of those surveyed had no opinion on Dowding&#x27;s performance. In an effort to increase his profile, the Labor Party ran a television advertisement campaign, Dowding released a comprehensive development strategy, and he adopted a higher profile when dealing with an industrial dispute. Polls in May and June showed that his profile had risen, with the undecided people falling to 22 percent. Those who rated him as &quot;good&quot; rose from 13 percent in April to 22 percent in June, those who rated him as &quot;fair&quot; rose from 33 percent to 50 percent, and those who rated him as &quot;poor&quot; stayed steady at 6 percent.

Although the Labor Government was quite popular at the time, the WA Inc scandal was starting to surface. The stock market crashed in October 1987, which spelled trouble for some of the government&#x27;s private investments. The Rothwells merchant bank went into liquidation in November 1988. Dowding said the government could lose up to $100 million from the bank&#x27;s collapse, however opposition frontbencher Bill Hassell said it would cost the government $400 million. The opposition ruled out blocking supply though. In November, the Labor Party paid for a two-minute prime time television commercial where Dowding made a speech promising that no more taxpayer money would be spent on Rothwells.

Additionally, the government was under fire after the Teachers&#x27; Credit Society donated $5,000 to the Labor Party in April 1987 after receiving an extension on a loan from the R&amp;I Bank, a state-owned bank. The donation was given back soon afterwards.

In the 1988–89 state budget, there was 23 percent more spending on education and 26 percent more spending on police. This meant one thousand more police officers within three years, as well as five hundred more teachers and 250 support staff for schools. This was in response to a 1988 national survey which showed that Western Australia had the largest classes in Australia. 66 percent of junior secondary classes had more than 25 students, and 36 percent had more than 30 students. The budget also included the release of two thousand state housing homes for sale, and the promise to build an electric railway line to Joondalup at a cost of $124 million.

At the 1989 state election, the Labor Party had a primary vote swing of 10.5 percent against it, and a two-party-preferred swing of 6.5 percent against it. Despite this, the party only lost one net seat in the Legislative Assembly, as the largest swings occurred in safe Labor seats and marginal seats generally had smaller swings. Labor&#x27;s 31 seats out of 57 were enough for a majority. Following the election, Dowding reshuffled his cabinet, relinquishing his position as treasurer and the minister for productivity.

==Leadership spill==
Within six months of the 1989 election, some Labor MPs were dissatisfied with Dowding, finding him arrogant, rude, and difficult to work with. His popularity was also hurt by the District Court trial of Western Colleries Limited director Tony Lloyd. His defence lawyers had argued that Dowding and acting energy minister Grill had ordered Lloyd to pay off a Rothwells debt using a $15 million cheque. In January 1990, Lloyd was found guilty of acting improperly, making him the first person convicted for an offence relating to WA Inc. After that, opinion polls showed support was as low as 32 percent. Additionally, the 1990 Australian federal election was coming up, and the Labor Party wanted to limit the seats lost by the party in Western Australia. Having a state leader less associated with WA Inc would have helped with that.

In early 1990, Dowding travelled to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, after Parker assured him that nothing would happen to his leadership while he was gone. State Secretary Stephen Smith, FMWU Secretary Jim McGinty, and seven Labor politicians – Lawrence, Parker, Taylor, Kay Hallahan, Keith Wilson, Geoff Gallop and Pam Beggs – met together to discuss Peter Dowding&#x27;s leadership, all deciding that he should be forced out. By 7 February 1990, a majority of the 47 members of the Labor caucus had signed a letter calling for Dowding&#x27;s resignation. He returned early from the World Economic Forum on 8 February in order to shore up his leadership, spending the next several days speaking to party members in an attempt to ensure their support. He also held a cabinet meeting on 9 February. At a caucus meeting on 12 February, Dowding and Parker resigned from their positions. Lawrence was elected as the leader of the Labor Party and Taylor was elected as the deputy leader. They were sworn in as premier and deputy premier respectively later that day by the acting governor. On that day, Lawrence promised to end WA Inc. Dowding criticised the leadership challenge, saying that the timing was premature and was done to help Labor win the federal election, rather than for what&#x27;s good for the state.

On 5 April 1990, Parker announced his impending resignation from Parliament. Although he planned on doing so later, Dowding resigned as well on 26 April 1990 to return to his career as a lawyer. Dowding said he had wanted to serve at least part of the upcoming session of Parliament, so he could defend his actions that lead to his downfall, but he resigned when he did at the request of Lawrence, who wanted the two by-elections to occur on the same day. Judy Edwards retained the seat for Labor, succeeding Dowding as the member for Maylands at the by-election.

==WA Inc royal commission==
Lawrence initially resisted calls for a royal commission into WA Inc, but after months of pressure, she announced in November 1990 that the royal commission would go ahead.

Dowding testified in front of the commission in November 1991 regarding his dealings with Laurie Connell and Alan Bond, the bailout of Rothwells and the purchase of the Kwinana Petrochemical Plant. When asked if the state government had moved to safeguard the $150million guarantee to Rothwells, Dowding said &quot;you don&#x27;t assume that Bond would steal $1.2billion or that Mr Connell would deceive and live like a parasite off the state.&quot; When asked about the government&#x27;s purchase of the petrochemical project, Dowding said that it was effectively a second rescue for Rothwells, but that he believed the project was viable and would not have made the deal otherwise.

The commission handed down its first report on 20 October 1992, which made adverse findings against Dowding. The report said that &quot;we have found that Mr Dowding acted improperly in interfering in the business affairs of the SGIC.&quot; Dowding responded by saying that some of the commission&#x27;s judgements of him were wrong, but that he was relieved the report did not find any of his decisions were corrupt or for financial gain.

==Later life==
After leaving parliament, Dowding was admitted to the bar in New South Wales. He was a partner in Briggs Paul Dowding in Sydney from 1992 to 1994, and a managing partner of DCH Legal Group in Perth from 1993 to 1996. Since 1996, he has practiced family law. In 2002, he was appointed as Senior Counsel in Western Australia. He was a recipient of a Centenary Medal in 2003.

Dowding divorced his third wife and on Boxing Day 2004, he married for the fourth time at the Round House in Fremantle.

As of 2022, Dowding lives in South Fremantle. In August 2023, he released a book co-authored with Ken Spillman about the life of his uncle, Bruce Dowding, who was part of the French Resistance and worked to smuggle Allied servicemen out of Nazi-occupied France in 1940 and 1941. He was eventually caught by the Gestapo and executed in 1943.

<text>The Ohio Court of Claims is a court of limited, statewide jurisdiction. The court&#x27;s jurisdiction extends to cases:
#Against the State of Ohio, in which the state has waived sovereign immunity
#Connected to suits against the State of Ohio where Plaintiffs are asking for equitable relief
#Involving denial of access to public records by the State or any county, city, or agency.

The court also hears appeals from decisions made by the Ohio Attorney General on claims allowed under the Victims of Crime Act.

The judges of the Court of Claims sit by assignment by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Currently, the assigned judges and magistrates are:
* Judge Lisa Sadler
* Judge David Cain
* Magistrate Holly T. Shaver
* Magistrate Robert Van Schoyck
* Magistrate Gary W. Peterson
* Magistrate Adam Morris
* Magistrate Amber Damiani

A Special Master hears claims for violations of access to public records. Todd Marti serves as the court&#x27;s Special Master.

Appeals from the Court of Claims are heard by the Tenth District Court of Appeals in Columbus.

The court is located in the Thomas J. Moyer Ohio Judicial Center in Columbus.

The clerk of the court is Anderson Renick.

== History ==
The Ohio Court of Claims was created in 1975 by the passage of the Court of Claims Act. The Court was created to replace the Sundry Claims Board which existed from 1917 through 1975. The Board was considered inadequate for hearing claims against the state for a number of reasons, including that the Attorney General both sat on the Board and had the job of representing the State of Ohio before the Board.

<text>Badbury Rings is an Iron Age hill fort and Scheduled Monument in east Dorset, England. It was in the territory of the Durotriges. In the Roman era a temple was located immediately west of the fort, and there was a Romano-British town known as &quot;Vindocladia&quot; a short distance to the south-west.

==Iron Age==
Badbury Rings sits above sea level. There are two main phases of construction; the first covered and was defended by multiple ditches, while the second was more than twice the size, covering and defended by a single ditch and rampart. Bronze Age round barrows in the vicinity demonstrate an earlier use of the area.
Until 1983 Badbury Rings was privately owned as part of the Kingston Lacy estate, and the owners discouraged investigation of the site. The site now belongs to the National Trust. A survey of the hillfort by the RCHME was begun in 1993. The summit area was cleared of undergrowth by the National Trust in 1997 and the conifer plantation was thinned out. This allowed the RCHME to complete the survey in 1998, which recorded 28 potential hut sites within the ramparts, although some depressions are probably caused by uprooted trees. The first excavations, led by Martin Papworth, took place in 2004, when three evaluation trenches were dug. Almost all of the pottery found was dated to the Late Iron Age. The current evidence does not suggest that the hillfort was a principal settlement in the Early Iron Age. It seems likely that the hillfort became depopulated towards the end of the Late Iron Age, perhaps as the &quot;Vindocladia&quot; settlement near Shapwick developed.

Badbury Rings is the fifth in a series of Iron Age earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites.

==Roman roads==

During the Roman era, five Roman roads formed a complex junction on the north side of Badbury Rings.

The Roman Conquest of Britain began in AD 43. It is likely that the Legio II Augusta campaigned in Dorset under the command of the future emperor Vespasian. About southeast of Badbury Rings, at Lake Farm, Ashington, near Wimborne, a fort was established. A military road from the Lake Farm fort was created which passed by the northeast side of Badbury Rings. Beyond Badbury Rings the road headed in a northwest direction (visible today as a thin strip of woodland) heading for the Roman fort at Hod Hill. At an early stage, this road formed a junction with Ackling Dyke, a Roman road which headed northeast to Old Sarum (&quot;Sorviodunum&quot;). Another road ran across country in a north by northwest direction towards Bath (&quot;Aquae Sulis&quot;), and another ran south to a small port in Poole Harbour (&quot;Moriconium&quot;, modern Hamworthy). The final road (still used as a modern trackway on the west side of Badbury Rings) ran in a southwest direction through the settlement of &quot;Vindocladia&quot; heading towards Dorchester (&quot;Durnovaria&quot;). This final road was not built until the later Roman period.

==Romano-Celtic temple==
Immediately west of Badbury Rings is the site of a Romano-Celtic temple. It is located within a polygonal boundary bank visible on aerial photographs. It was excavated as early as 1900, and again in 1952. These excavations revealed stone roofing slabs, painted wall-plaster, and over 185 Roman coins, as well as 21 Durotrigian silver and bronze coins. Pottery, glass beads, bronze pins, a bracelet and a brooch were also recovered. Further excavations were conducted in 2000 which showed that the temple was in use from the 1st to 5th centuries.

==&quot;Vindocladia&quot;==

A short distance () to the southwest of Badbury Rings, between the hillfort and the modern village of Shapwick, lay a small Romano-British town (), believed to be that listed in the &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot; as &quot;Vindocladia&quot; (from Brittonic &quot;*windos&quot; &quot;white&quot; + &quot;*klādiyos&quot; &quot;ditch, earthwork&quot;). In the later Roman period, a small fort was also established on the east side of the town. The fort was only discovered in 1975, and the existence of the town only came to light in the 1990s.

It has long been known that there was Roman activity in the area. A Roman pit and occupation debris were discovered in 1954 in the village of Shapwick, which included Samian ware pottery, a bronze coin of Claudius, and a rim fragment of a mortarium. In 1990 an archaeological field survey revealed three areas of building debris including roof and flue tiles, tesserae, and 2nd–4th century pottery. Excavations, led by Martin Papworth, took place in 1991, 1995, and 2004. The 1991 excavations uncovered robber trenches, tesserae, pottery, painted wall plaster and evidence for ironworking. The 1995 excavations demonstrated that the Roman occupation overlay numerous pits and ditches dating from the middle to late Iron Age, and uncovered smithing hearths dating from the second century. They further demonstrated that the Roman road through the settlement and the associated fort were not built until the later Roman period. Excavation of the settlement&#x27;s boundary ditch in 2004 uncovered early first-century pottery, including a Samian-ware platter, as well as a first-century brooch.

The evidence suggests that the settlement began as a pre-Roman village or town of the late Iron-Age which continued in use in the Roman period. Coins and pottery recovered from the site show that it was occupied until at least the 5th century. A geophysical survey of the entire settlement has shown that the site covers 25 hectares. It appears to have been one of the biggest Roman towns in Dorset, second only to Dorchester (&quot;Durnovaria&quot;). It is likely that the town was the &quot;Vindocladia&quot; listed in the &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot; as the only named place between Old Sarum (&quot;Sorviodunum&quot;) and Dorchester.

The Roman fort is a rectangular enclosure with straight sides and rounded corners, surrounded by triple ditches. It measures around and encloses about . It is located on the east side of the town. Pottery picked up on the ground in 1975 suggested a mid 1st-century date for the fort. However, the subsequent excavations have revealed that the fort was not built until the later Roman period, and that the fort went out of use at the end of the Roman era. The fort contained a large building complex, and may have been the site of an imperial inn, or &quot;mansio&quot;.

==Saxon era==
Finds of late Roman material within the hillfort indicate that Badbury Rings was reoccupied, perhaps as security declined in the post-Roman period. The ancient frontier of Bokerley Dyke to the northeast was revived and may have played a role in keeping the invading Saxons out of Dorset during the 5th and 6th centuries.

The identification of Badbury Rings with Battle of Mount Badon (first mentioned by Gildas) was reported in the 19th century by John Hutchins as originating with a supposition by the &#x27;eminent Dr Edwin Guest&#x27; in the Salisbury Volume of the Archaeological Institute. Local historian Roy Carr has suggested that the Saxons were held off from crossing Bokerley Dyke, by the threat of an army in the west, perhaps stationed at Badbury Rings. Badbury Rings is one of three sites regularly advanced as the location of this battle, with the city of Bath also recognised as a contender.

Edward the Elder brought an army to Badbury, soon after his succession to the throne in 899, to face down a challenge to his claim for the crown by his cousin Æthelwold, based at nearby Wimborne Minster.

==Antiquarian accounts==
The Tudor antiquarian John Leland visited Badbury Rings during his &quot;Itinerary&quot; of England conducted between 1538 and 1543. After speaking about the nearby town of Wimborne Minster he wrote:
==The site today==
The site, on the dip slope of Cranborne Chase, is now part of the Kingston Lacy estate owned by the National Trust since 1982, with free access. The hillfort has been a scheduled ancient monument since 1924. On a clear day, the Isle of Wight is visible from the top.

<doc id="1089859" wikidata="Q1337990" url="?curid=1089859" title="Three Sides Live">
<text>Three Sides Live is the third live album by the English rock band Genesis, released as a double album on 4 June 1982 on Charisma Records in the United Kingdom. It was released by Atlantic Records in the United States. After touring in support of their studio album &quot;Abacab&quot; ended in December 1981 the band entered an eight-month break in activity, during which they selected recordings from their previous tours for a live album. &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; includes recordings between 1976 and 1981; the UK edition contains additional live tracks on the fourth side of the double LP, while the original international edition featured tracks from their 1982 EP &quot;3×3&quot; and B-sides from &quot;Duke&quot;. Subsequent international reissues have adopted the UK track sequence.

&quot;Three Sides Live&quot; received a mostly positive critical reception and was a commercial success, peaking at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it sold 500,000 copies. Its release coincided with the band&#x27;s &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; concert film. It was remastered in 1994 and 2009, the latter for their &quot;Genesis Live 1973–2007&quot; box set.

== Background ==
In December 1981, Genesis wrapped their four-month tour of Europe and North America to support the release of their eleventh studio album, &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). The band then entered an eight-month break in activity, during which they each pursued solo projects and selected recordings from their previous tours for inclusion on a new live album. All editions of &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; contain recordings from their 1980 and 1981 tours across the first three sides. The fourth side of the UK edition contains additional live tracks from 1976, 1978, and 1980, while the international edition contains tracks from the group&#x27;s second EP &quot;3×3&quot; (1982) – &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;You Might Recall&quot;, and &quot;Me and Virgil&quot; and two B-sides recorded during the sessions for &quot;Duke&quot; (1980) – &quot;Open Door&quot; and &quot;Evidence of Autumn&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Three Sides Live&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 10 in the US. It was certified silver and gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 14 June 1982, the latter for 100,000 copies sold. In the United States, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 4 October 1982 for 500,000 copies sold.

=== Reception ===

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a rave review, particularly praising Genesis&#x27;s advancement to more refined and concise material: &quot;Unlike &quot;Seconds Out&quot;, where the concert versions of Genesis&#x27; songs were shrouded in virtuosic bluster, this album offers incisive, sharply focused performances uncluttered by theatrics or instrumental tedium.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review asserted that the performances were impressive and exciting throughout, delivering nothing but &quot;lean, crisp, and generally bracing accounts of the group&#x27;s then-current sound.&quot;

In a review published in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; by Robin Smith, the album received a mixed response. The atmosphere he experienced in concert at one of their Wembley Arena gigs in 1981 was absent from the album, which he deemed &quot;hardly a sparkling addition&quot; to the Genesis catalogue. Smith attributed this to the song selection and it being recorded with &quot;less than inspired audiences&quot;. He praised the performances of &quot;Dodo/Lurker&quot;, &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, but picked the third and fourth side as stand out tracks. Smith concluded that he would be listening to &quot;Seconds Out&quot;, the band&#x27;s second live album, &quot;for years to come&quot;.

=== Reissues ===
In 1994, &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; was remastered and reissued with the UK edition worldwide. Four of the five additional studio selections from that out of print release were issued in 2000 on the &quot;Genesis Archive 2: 1976–1992&quot; box set (all but &quot;Me And Virgil&quot;), and all five songs have since been included on the bonus disc of the &quot;Genesis 1976–1982&quot; box set.

<text>Bathgate ( or , ) is a town in West Lothian, Scotland, west of Livingston and adjacent to the M8 motorway. Nearby towns are Linlithgow, Livingston, and West Calder. A number of villages fall under the umbrella of Bathgate, including Blackburn, Whitburn, Stoneyburn, Armadale, Torphichen and Fauldhouse.

Situated south of the ancient Neolithic burial site at Cairnpapple Hill, Bathgate and the surrounding area show signs of habitation since about 3500 BC and the world&#x27;s oldest known reptile fossil has been found in the town. By the 12th century, Bathgate was a small settlement, with a church at Kirkton and a castle south of the present day town centre. Local mines were established in the 17th century but the town remained small in size until the coming of the industrial revolution. By the Victorian era, Bathgate grew in prominence as an industrial and mining centre, principally associated with the coal and shale oil industries. By the early 20th century, much of the mining and heavy industry around the town had ceased and the town developed manufacturing industries, principally in vehicle production and later electronics before these factories closed in the late 20th century.

Today Bathgate is the second largest town in West Lothian, after Livingston and serves as a regional commuter town within the Scottish Central Belt.

== History ==

=== Medieval (c1100–1500) ===
Bathgate first enters the chronicles of history in a confirmation charter by King Malcolm IV of Scotland (1141 – 9 December 1165). In royal charters of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, the name of Bathgate has appeared as: Bathchet (1160), Bathket (1250) and Bathgetum (1316). Batket in the 14th century, and by the 15th appeared as both Bathgat and Bathcat, the latter an offshoot of Uchtred Dalrymple&#x27;s feudal lineage, which ruled during ancient times. The name is a &quot;manifest corruption&quot; of an earlier Cumbric name meaning &#x27;Boar Wood&#x27; (cf. Welsh &quot;baedd coed&quot;).

Early records of Bathgate are somewhat sketchy. It is recorded that, around 1160, Uchtred Dalrymple, Sheriff of Linlithgow, and Geoffrey de Melville came to Bathgate at the command of King Malcolm IV and measured out an area of land which was to form the basis of Bathgate Parish. The church and all its associate property were placed under the auspices of Holyrood Abbey at that time and paid a tenth of its income from the land to that institution.

In 1315, the daughter of King Robert I of Scotland (Robert The Bruce), Marjorie (alternatively spelt Margery) Bruce, married Walter Stewart (or Steward) (1293–1326), the 6th Lord High Steward of Scotland. The dowry to her husband included the lands and castle of Bathgate. Walter died at the castle on 9 April 1326. This marriage is still celebrated in an annual pageant forming part of the Bathgate Procession &amp; John Newland Festival, colloquially known as the Bathgate Procession.

In the 1846 book &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland&quot;, Samuel Lewis writes:

Another antiquarian, W. Jardin, in the &quot;Statistical Account of Scotland Vol I&quot; (1793), and referring to Walter Stewart, states:

Dating from around the same time the remains of Bathgate&#x27;s former parish church still stand at Kirkton. The original 12th-century construction was absorbed by a later build in 1739 when a new church was erected on the same site. The walls of the church were consolidated in 1846. This simple whitewashed edifice served the community until its last service on 9 April 1882. King Malcolm IV makes reference to the original church in a charter, granting it to the monks of Holyrood Abbey. Records show that Holyrood Abbey gave the church to the abbot and monks of Newbattle Abbey in 1327.

=== 17th–18th centuries ===
In 1606 silver ore was found at nearby Hilderston, in the shadow of Cairnpapple Hill, by a prospecting collier, Sandy Maund. This accidental discovery began a short-lived crown &quot;project&quot; in the area. Advisers to King James VI of Scotland became aware of the discovery, and in April 1608 repossessed the land for the crown. The prospector Bevis Bulmer and Thomas Foulis opened a mine called &quot;God&#x27;s Blessing&quot;. A sample of the ore was shipped to London, and assayed in the Tower of London by Andrew Palmer. By December 1608 it was clear that the ore in the mine was of varying quality and by March 1613 all efforts to extract silver from the area were abandoned.

Bathgate remained a very small rural community until the middle of the 19th century with only a foray by Covenanters in the 17th century to unrest the populace. Francis Groome, in the &quot;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland&quot; (1882–84) writes:

Robert Louis Stevenson, in the book &quot;Lay Morals, Part 2: The Pentland Rising. A Page of History&quot; further elucidates upon this night in November 1666:
His depiction goes on to describe how the half the army perished in the freezing weather as they headed towards the Pentland Hills.

=== 19th century ===

Established around 1800, the Glenmavis Distillery in Bathgate was purchased in 1831 by John McNab, who produced the eponymous &quot;MacNab&#x27;s Celebrated Glenmavis Dew&quot; from the site until the distillery&#x27;s closure in 1910. In 1885, the distillery was producing 80,000 gallons of single malt a year which was transported to Scotland, England and the colonies.

In 1831 Bathgate Academy was built. Designed by the Edinburgh architects R &amp; R Dickson this is Bathgate&#x27;s only large public building of historic merit. It was endowed by a Jamaican plantation owner John Newlands. The building later became part of Balbardie Primary School, and later still was changed into private housing.

By the opening of Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway in 1849, local mines and quarries were extracting coal, lime, and ironstone.

James Young&#x27;s discovery of cannel coal in the Boghead area of Bathgate, and the subsequent opening of the Bathgate Chemical Works in 1852, the world&#x27;s first commercial oil-works, manufacturing paraffin oil and paraffin wax, signalled an end to the rural community of previous centuries. When the cannel coal resources dwindled around 1866, Young started distilling paraffin from much more readily available shale. The landscape of the Lothians is still dotted with the orange spoil heaps (called bings) from this era. Collieries and quarries and the associated industries (brickworks, steelworks) were the main employers in Bathgate as the 19th century drew to a close.

Between 1882 and 1884, Bathgate High Parish Church was constructed on Jarvey St. Designed by Wardrop and Reid, the church was built of sandstone in Romanesque architectural style. It is Category B listed.

=== 20th century ===

In 1904, St David&#x27;s Church was built in Bathgate on George Street. Designed by the Scottish architect James Graham Fairley, it is in Early English architectural style and the church is Category B listed. The church includes a belltower in north Italian campanile style. The church is now the local Bathgate cinema. A few years later in 1908, St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was built to a design by Charles Ménart on Livery Street. St Mary&#x27;s is in a Gothic architectural style and is Category C listed.

In the mid-20th century, many local industries in the town had closed and West Lothian was designated a Special Development Area. In such areas, extra financial inducements were offered by the British government to assist companies wishing to relocate. As a result, in 1961, the BMC—which consisted of the merged Austin Motor Company and Morris Motors—located a new truck and tractor plant in Bathgate rather than expanding their Longbridge plant as originally planned. The plant closed in 1986 under ownership of British Leyland.

On 24 March 1986, the Bathgate-Edinburgh railway line was re-opened to passengers for the first time since the 1950s. This railway line was extended as the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link to Airdrie allowing train services to run between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley via on time and on budget in December 2010.

The world&#x27;s oldest known reptile fossil, &quot;Westlothiana lizziae&quot; (affectionately referred to as &quot;Lizzie&quot;), was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate in 1987; it is now in the Museum of Scotland.

Early in 1992, the US company Motorola opened a mobile phone manufacturing (Personal Communications Sector or PCS) plant at Easter Inch in Bathgate (now the Pyramids Business Park). In 2001, the global market for mobile phones dropped sharply and as a consequence, despite pressure from the highest levels of UK government, on 24 April 2001 Motorola announced the closure of the plant and the loss of 3,106 jobs. The site was occupied by HMRC. In 2021 and early 2022, the Pyramids operated as the principal COVID-19 vaccine centre in West Lothian. In December 2021, it was announced that the Pyramids Business Park would become the site of a new large film and TV studio. Some previous productions at the site have included the film T2 Trainspotting and the TV show Good Omens, which stars local actor David Tennant.

== Demography ==
==Economy==
Bathgate was an industrial town in its time. It played host to the Menzies&#x27; Foundry (demolished due to the railway link construction) and British Leyland was sited in Bathgate. It had two train stations, Bathgate North and South. There was a link that ran from the site of the current station, along Menzies Road, at the rear of one side of Mill Road all the way to Easton Road where the station was. This was used for the coal-mining industries and the foundries.

===Shopping===
Bathgate is home to a number of national and international retailers. In the late 19th century the co-operative halls were built and served the community until closure in the 1980s. It provided a bakery, butchery, funeral parlour, grocery store, clothing, furniture and a dance hall. Even after the closure the co-operative dance hall was used as the Room at the Top until it caught fire in 1997.

==Culture==
===Bathgate Procession and Community Festival===
John Newland was one of the town&#x27;s early major benefactors. Newland had emigrated to the West Indies and became a rich planter, using slaves to maintain and harvest his sugar-cane crop. His benefaction allowed the establishment of Bathgate Academy, which was founded in 1833. He was remembered by an annual pageant (known as the Procession or Newland&#x27;s day), held on the first Saturday in June. In light of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests a petition to change the processions name due to Newlands slave trade past, gained hundreds of signatories. In June 2020 the name was changed to the more suitable &#x27;Bathgate Procession and Community Festival&#x27;.

===Theatre and Cinema ===

The Regal is a community theatre in Bathgate on North Bridge Street. The theatre was originally a cinema, completed in 1938 and later renovated in 1995. It is in the Art Deco style.

The local cinema, Bathgate Cinema, located on the site of the old St Davids Church closed in April 2024.

===George Place and the Steelyard===
The central town square of Bathgate is known as the Steelyard which lies to the north of George Place. The Steelyard has a memorial fountain, the McLagan Fountain, provided with support from the wife of the 19th century MP Peter McLagan. It was produced by Walter MacFarlane &amp; Co. and erected in 1878 at the crossroads with Hopetoun Street but later moved to its present position.

===Museum===
The Bennie Museum is a local community museum in the town. The museum opened in 1989 and is run by volunteers as a charitable trust. It contains items connected with the history of Bathgate and well as exhibits of childhood life. The museum is located at 9-11 Mansefield Street in a row of cottages that are Category C listed dating between the late 18th and mid 19th century in construction.

===Land art===

Part of the M8 Art Project saw the artist Patricia Leighton&#x27;s &#x27;Sawtooth Ramps&#x27; project being built in 1993, now more commonly referred to as the Pyramids. The sculpture is long and consists of seven high ramps. The artist based the design on local geographic features (drumlins) and the shape of the surrounding bings. The pyramidal shape of the sculpture gave rise to the name of the nearby Pyramids Business park. In April 2007, a local farmer painted the sheep which graze on the pyramids bright red with a harmless sheep spray.

In 1998 the artist Lumir Soukup built the earth sculpture &quot;The Bathgate Face&quot; at Wester Inch. By taking facial measurements of more than 1200 Bathgate residents, the artist was able to create an &#x27;average profile&#x27; which was the basis for the sculpture.
Development in the area in 2004 threatened to demolish the sculpture but the artist managed to persuade developers to build around his work.

===Music===
Bathgate was home to rock band Goodbye Mr Mackenzie in the 1980s and 1990s, a success of the local college&#x27;s Music Industry course.

==Transport==

<text>A travois (; Canadian French, from French ; also travoise or travoy) is an A-frame structure that was used to drag loads over land, most notably by the Plains Indians of North America.

== Construction and use ==
The basic construction consists of a platform or netting mounted on two long poles, lashed in the shape of an A-frame; the frame was dragged with the sharply pointed end forward. Sometimes the blunt end of the frame was stabilized by a third pole bound across the two poles.

The travois was dragged by hand, sometimes fitted with a shoulder harness for more efficient dragging, or dragged by dogs or horses (after the 16th-century introduction of horses by the Spanish).

A travois could either be loaded by piling goods atop the bare frame and tying them in place, or by first stretching cloth or leather over the frame to hold the load to be dragged.

Although considered more primitive than wheel-based forms of transport, on the type of territory where the travois was used (forest floors, soft soil, snow, etc.), rather than roadways, wheels would have encountered difficulties which would have made them less efficient. As such the travois was employed by &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; in New France&#x27;s fur trade with the Plains Tribes.

It is possible for a person to transport more weight on a travois than can be carried on the back.

== Dog travois ==
According to &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The dog travois of pre-European times was small, capable of pulling not more than 20 to 30 kg.&quot; Travel by dog travois was slower in hot weather, which is tiring for dogs. The dog travois can be seen in the paintings of Karl Bodmer.

== Horse travois ==
By the mid-18th century, the dog travois had given way to the horse travois. According to &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;When dogs were replaced by horses, the greater pulling power allowed tipis to increase in size and household goods to multiply.&quot; The Native Languages of the Americas website relates that:
After horses were introduced to North America, many Plains Indian tribes began to make larger horse-drawn travois. Instead of making specially constructed travois sleds, they would simply cross a pair of tepee poles across the horse&#x27;s back and attach a burden platform between the poles behind the horse. This served two purposes at once, as the horses could then simultaneously carry the tepee poles and some additional baggage. Horses, of course, could pull much greater weight than dogs. Children often rode in the back of horse travois.
When traveling with a travois, it was traditional for Salish people to leave the tipi poles behind at the camp &quot;for use by the next tribe or family to camp there.&quot;

A horse travois can be made with either A-frame or H-frame construction.

== Other ways to use a travois==
The travois served the Native Americans in a number of ingenious ways. Before the use of horses, Blackfoot women made a curved fence of dog travois’ tied together, front end up, to hold driven animals enclosed until the hunters could kill them. When the women put up a tipi, they placed an upright horse travois against a tipi pole and used it as a ladder so they could attach the two upper sides of the lodge cover with wooden pins. A travois leaned against a branch of a tree functioned as a simple burial scaffold for a dead Crow baby tied to it.

== Travois tracks ==

What today is known as the Lewis and Clark Trail-Travois Road, and Montana&#x27;s Lewis and Clark Pass were areas heavily traveled where travois &quot;were dragged over the trail, causing deep, parallel tracks to mark the earth,&quot; which are still visible today. Remains of travois tracks can also be seen at the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site.

There is archeological evidence to support the thesis that travois were used in other parts of the world before the invention of the wheel.

<text>Bellshill (pronounced &quot;Bells hill&quot;) is a town in North Lanarkshire in Scotland, southeast of Glasgow city centre and west of Edinburgh. Other nearby localities are Motherwell to the south, Hamilton to the southwest, Viewpark to the west, Holytown to the east and Coatbridge to the north. 

The town of Bellshill (including the villages of Orbiston and Mossend) has a population of about 20,650. From 1996 to 2016, it was considered to be part of the Greater Glasgow metropolitan area. Since then it has been counted as part of a continuous suburban settlement anchored by Motherwell, with a total population of around 125,000.

==History==

The earliest record of Bellshill&#x27;s name is handwritten on a map by Timothy Pont dated 1596; the letters are difficult to distinguish. It&#x27;s possible that it reads Belſsill with the first s being an old-fashioned long s. The site is recorded as being east of &quot;Vdinſtoun&quot; and north of &quot;Bothwel-hauch&quot; (which confusingly is above &quot;Orbeſton&quot; on Pont&#x27;s map). The name can also been seen on a map, which was derived from Pont&#x27;s work, made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu; he calls the place &quot;Belmil&quot;. The village consisted of a row of quarry workers&#x27; houses owned by a Mr. Bell, who owned a stone quarry to the south of Belmill. Charles Ross&#x27;s map of 1773 has &quot;Belsihill&quot; marked north of Crosgates and Orbiston. 

About 1810, this new settlement took on the name Bellshill and continued to grow. It absorbed nearby villages such as Nesnas, Black Moss and Sykehead. Bellshill was on the road which linked Glasgow and Edinburgh.

According to the first Statistical Account, in the late 1700s the parish of Bothwell, which encompasses modern Bellshill, was a centre of hand-loom weaving with 113 weavers recorded. Some 50 colliers were listed. A hundred or so years later, these occupations had changed places in degree of importance to the area economy. With the introduction of new machinery in the mid-19th century, many cottage weavers lost their livelihood. Demand for coal to feed British industry resulted in expansion that by the 1870s, produced 20 deep pits operating in the area.

The first mine to open (and the last to close in 1953) was the Thankerton mine. Others followed swiftly and rapidly increased the size of the town, attracting a steady stream of immigrant workers from abroad, particularly from Ireland and Lithuania. The town is sometimes referred to as &#x27;Little Lithuania&#x27; because of these immigrants. (Historically it was called &#x27;Little Poland&#x27;, as contemporary evidence shows locals did not work to distinguish incomers&#x27; backgrounds). Factors adversely affecting integration for the first generation of these &#x27;new Scots&#x27; included a language barrier, minority religion (most were Catholic), and hostility based on suspicion that they were taking jobs, by accepting lower wages and being used to break strikes. – Lithuanians in Bellshill and elsewhere tended to identify more closely with the Irish communities of each town, who had similar issues. 

The rise in the migrant population (though severely lessened by the political changes following the First World War and subsequent Russian Revolution, which adversely affected the status of Lithuanians both in their homeland and in Britain) resulted in their opening The Scottish Lithuanian Recreation and Social Club on Calder Road in the Mossend area. Gradually Lithuanian culture has faded over the decades, as families have assimilated into Scottish life. Younger generations sometimes are unaware of their family&#x27;s history, also because of intermarriage, name changes and anglicisation of distinctive surnames (either voluntarily or by obligation). 

Among the most famous of the descendants of this community was footballer Billy McNeill of Celtic and Scotland. Other mid-20th century players of Lithuanian heritage included Andy Swallow, Alex Millar, Matt Balunas, and John Jack.

Iron and steel production were also central to the development of the town through the 19th century. J. B. Neilson, developer of the revolutionary &#x27;hot blast&#x27; process, opened the first iron works in the area (Mossend Iron Works) in 1839.

During the industrial boom there were a number of railway stations, including Mossend, Fallside and Bell Cross. The settlement is now served solely by Bellshill railway station.

Maternity services were provided at Bellshill Maternity Hospital until the hospital was closed in 2001.
According to a report by the Halifax Building Society, in the first quarter of 2005 Bellshill was the UK&#x27;s property hot spot with a 46% rise in house prices. This took the average property price to £105,698 (according to reports published April 2005).

Reflecting an increase in new Muslim immigrant populations from east Asia, in 2006, a new mosque was opened in the Mossend area of Bellshill. It has become one of the largest mosques in Scotland.

The streetscape project, a plan to regenerate and modernise the town centre, commenced Apr 2007 and was completed nearly three years later. The project, created a one-way system on the main street and provided more space for pedestrians.

==Education==
Bellshill once had six primary schools, including Belvidere Primary School. This was closed in early June 2010 and has now been demolished. 

Holy Family Primary School was founded in 1868. It moved to new buildings in 1907 to accommodate the influx of Lithuanian, Polish and Irish Catholics seeking work in the area. Other primary schools include Sacred Heart Primary, Mossend Primary, Noble Primary, St. Gerard&#x27;s Primary, and Lawmuir Primary. 

There are two fairly large secondary schools, Bellshill Academy and Cardinal Newman High School, a Catholic school.

==Religion==

Historically a Relief Church for 1000 people was built in Bellshill in 1763. Today several churches serve the town. St Andrews United Free Church of Scotland sits at Bellshill Cross whilst the Church of Scotland parish churches are at opposite ends of the Main Street. Bellshill Central Parish church is opposite The Academy, and Bellshill West Parish Church is next to the Sir Matt Busby Sports Centre. The town&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish churches are St Gerard&#x27;s, Sacred Heart, and Holy Family, Mossend.

==Transport==
Bellshill lies at an important point on Scotland&#x27;s motorway network, situated around south of the M8 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh and their respective airports. It is about the same distance north of the M74 motorway to and from England; the A725 road running directly to the west of the town links the two. 

The presence of this busy transport corridor and the availability of land following the decline of older heavy industry has led to the development of two large, modern industrial estates (Bellshill and Righead) flanking the A725. The Eurocentral industrial and distribution park is about northeast of the town, and also features a railway freight terminal. Once heavily reliant on the railways relating to coal mining, Bellshill is still served by a rail junction to the east of Mossend; it connects two of the main passenger routes covering southern, western and central Scotland Argyle Line –and Shotts Line – both of which stop at Bellshill railway station in the town centre.

==Culture==
The Bellshill Cultural Centre has a free library. Various singers, such as Sheena Easton, and sportsmen such as Sir Matt Busby and Billy McNeill hailed from the town (a statue of McNeill at Bellshill Cross was unveiled in 2022).

==Music==
Bellshill is also known for its music, especially since the mid-1980s. Bands such as the Soup Dragons, BMX Bandits, and Teenage Fanclub put Bellshill on the map as an indie rock hot-spot in Scotland. The scene - known as the &quot;Bellshill Sound&quot; or the &quot;Bellshill Beat&quot; - was celebrated by influential DJ John Peel in the Channel 4 television series &quot;Sounds Of The Suburbs&quot;. 

Bellshill continues to produce well respected and influential independent pop music, with members of Mogwai and De Rosa hailing from the town. Sheena Easton was also from the town, and attended Bellshill Academy.

==Sport==
The town has a football team, Bellshill Athletic, that plays in the West of Scotland Football League. The club won promotion to the Second Division in 2024 after finishing 3rd behind Lanark United and Lesmahagow. They play their home games at Rockburn park. They had moved from Tollcross, Glasgow, after New Brandon Park was closed to reduce costs.

Bellshill also has the Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex that opened in 1995. (It is named after the late Manchester United legend who was born and brought up in the area). It has a 25m swimming pool, with two large spectator seating areas either side, a large hall, and health suite. The complex also has a gym and a dance studio.

A golf course is located next to nearby Strathclyde Park, which is within walking distance of parts of the town, particularly Orbiston. The Greenlink Cycle Path passes through the golf course and the Orbiston area of Bellshill, heading towards Forgewood.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz W128 is a 6-cylinder luxury car produced by Mercedes-Benz from 1958 to 1960 and marketed as the Mercedes-Benz 220 SE. It was available in sedan, coupé, or cabriolet body styles, and it was the last new model of the &quot;Ponton&quot; range which had design and styling roots beginning in 1953 with the Mercedes-Benz 180 sedan (W120 chassis). It was largely identical to its 220 S predecessor, except for having petrol injection,&quot; &#x27;Einspritzung&#x27; &quot;in German, reflected in the additional E in its 220 SE designation.

The 220 SE featured a unitized body/frame construction and fully independent suspension. All models were fitted with Mercedes&#x27; M127 2.2 L (2195 cc) straight 6 gasoline engine with aluminum head, overhead camshaft, and Bosch mechanical fuel injection. This was done by intermittent inlet manifold injection (like the 300 d) and meant that the 2.2-liter engine now produced 115 HP. An automatic clutch was available with the column-mounted 4-speed manual transmission.

At the time, the cabriolet was priced similar to Cadillac&#x27;s top-end Eldorado Biarritz (DM 23,400/$8,091). Nearly every interior surface of the coupé and cabriolet was covered in wood or leather, and matching leather luggage was available. However, power steering, windows, air conditioning, and an automatic transmission were not available. The W128 was succeeded by the &quot;Fintail&quot; series starting with the W111 line.

==Production==
The W128 sedan was produced from October 1958 to August 1959 and the Coupé and Cabriolet from July 1958 to November 1960.



===Later models===
The 220 SE model designation lived on for a few more years with the 1959 220 SEb &quot;fin-body&quot; sedans and the 1961 220 SEb coupé and cabriolet (chassis W111).

<doc id="1089936" wikidata="Q3517103" url="?curid=1089936" title="Teeko">
<text>Teeko is an abstract strategy game invented by John Scarne in 1937 and rereleased in refined form in 1952 and again in the 1960s. Teeko was marketed by Scarne&#x27;s company, John Scarne Games Inc.; its quirky name, he said, borrowed letters from the games Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Checkers, and Bingo.

==Standard Teeko==
Standard Teeko is also known as Teeko 44 Positions and is a game for two players.

===Equipment===
The Teeko board consists of twenty-five spaces arranged in a five-by-five grid. There are eight markers, four black and four red; in the final edition of the game (1964), the markers are marked with one to four spots similar to the standard pips on dice.

One player, &quot;Black&quot; plays the black markers, and the other, &quot;Red&quot;, plays the red.

===Gameplay===
One player conceals two pawns in their closed hands, one of each color. The other player selects one hand and plays the color that is revealed.

# Black moves first and places one marker on any space on the board, with the exception of the central spot on the board.
# Red then places a marker on any unoccupied space.
# Players continue to take turns placing markers on empty spaces until all eight markers are on the board.
# Once all eight pieces are on the board, if neither player has won after this initial &quot;drop&quot; placement phase, then they move their pieces one at a time, with Black playing first.
# A piece may be moved only to an empty space adjacent to its starting space, meaning adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as indicated by the connecting lines on the board.

===Objective===
The object of the game is for either player to win by having all four of their markers in a straight line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) or on a square of four adjacent spaces. Adjacency is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, but does not wrap around the edges of the board. The &quot;44 positions&quot; name comes from the number of ways in which four in a row or the small square can be created.
If a player wins by completing four-in-a-row or a small square, the score for the game is based on the pip value of the last marker placed or moved to win, and the position of that last marker on the board. When the last marker is played onto the center or one of the four corners of the board, the player receives a bonus of four points in addition to the pip value; plays into one of the other 20 spots on the board receive just the pip value with no bonus.

===Analysis===
The rules, as summarized above, are very simple, but the strategy is complicated enough to fill a book, &quot;Scarne on Teeko&quot; (1955). Nonetheless, Guy L. Steele Jr. solved the game (i.e., showed what must occur if both players play perfectly) via computer in 1998 and found neither player can force a win. Steele also showed that the Advanced Teeko variant is a win for Black (again, assuming perfect play), as is one other variant, but the other fourteen variants are draws.

==Variations and history==
According to Scarne, the idea for Teeko started when he devised a winning strategy for &quot;Nim&quot;; since it had sixteen distinct starting moves, it was relatively easy to memorize how to counter each one; to solve this issue, he later developed the game &quot;Scarne&quot; in the early 1930s to have 252 distinct starting positions, which later was withdrawn and rereleased as &quot;Scar-Nee&quot; (1950) and &quot;Scarney&quot; (1961). Scarne had 5000 copies of &quot;Scarne&quot; printed in 1934 but only sold 300 after a month of live demonstrations at Macy&#x27;s; to prevent his mother from learning it was not successful, he destroyed the remainder by fire.

At about the same time that he released the initial version of &quot;Scarne&quot;, Scarne also started examining the game of &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot;, which has nine starting moves, and began developing what would eventually become Teeko. When it was released initially in 1945, the game was named Teko and used a 4×4 board. The name Teko is derived from the letters &quot;T&quot; from Tic-tac-toe, &quot;E&quot; from chEss, &quot;K&quot; from checKers, and &quot;O&quot; from bingO. The game received its updated name of Teeko in the 1950s, and Scarne released the final version in 1964.

To promote the game, Scarne held a challenge in 1955 to play &quot;Teeko&quot; against ten different opponents, promising US$1000 to each player that could take two out of three rounds from him, which received attention from newspapers. Scarne ended up winning all ten matches, but did not receive publicity for this feat afterward. After the final version of the game was released, the inventory was destroyed during a fire at the company that was hired to store and distribute the products of John Scarne Games, and Teeko fell into relative obscurity.

There are sixteen variations of Teeko which have slightly different rules, with the primary variants being Alternate Teeko and Advanced Teeko. All sixteen are outlined in &quot;Scarne on Teeko&quot;; the rules above are for &quot;Standard Teeko&quot; (or &quot;Teeko&quot;). In Alternate Teeko, the opponent may dictate where a piece is placed during the opening &quot;drop&quot; phase; i.e., when it is Black&#x27;s turn to place a new piece, Red can either point to where the piece should go, or pass the privilege back to Black. This alternate rule may be applied to one, two, three, or all four pieces placed by an opponent during the drop phase, for the first or last of the dropped pieces, which gives seven distinct variations. For example, in the &quot;One-Move Alternate&quot; variant, the 1st drop is played by Alternate rules followed by the 2nd through 4th drops played with Standard rules, denoted as 1A/3S; the other variants are &quot;Two-Move Alternate&quot; (2A/2S), &quot;Three-Move Alternate&quot; (3A/1S), &quot;Alternate&quot; (4A), &quot;One-Move Standard&quot; (1S/3A), &quot;Two-Move Standard&quot; (2S/2A), and &quot;Three-Move Standard&quot; (3S/1A).

Advanced Teeko adds more winning conditions, including &quot;extended&quot; 9-, 16-, or 25-cell squares for 58 winning positions in total (&quot;Teeko 58 Positions&quot;) or small or large right-angle diamond / rhombus shapes. In Advanced Teeko, players may choose an additional variation in which they are awarded bonus points for creating the extended shapes, as there are fewer ways to make them.

Steele showed that Advanced Teeko is a win for Black (assuming, again, that both players play perfectly), as is one other variation, but the other fourteen are draws.

<doc id="1089937" wikidata="Q2172204" url="?curid=1089937" title="Barrow Gurney">
<text>Barrow Gurney is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated in the unitary authority of North Somerset on the B3130, midway between the A38 and A370 near the Long Ashton bypass and Bristol Airport, south west of Bristol city centre. The civil parish includes Barrow Common, and has a population of 349.

It is close to Barrow Gurney Reservoirs, which supply drinking water for Bristol, and feed the Land Yeo which runs alongside the B3130 through the village. It was also the site of Barrow Hospital.

==History==

The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Barrow Gurney was held by Nigel de Gournay, who would have won his lands in Englishcombe, Twerton, Swainswick and Barrow Gurney by fighting for William I of England. His original home must have been Gournay, which was half-way between Dieppe and Paris.

The parish was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe.

A Benedictine nunnery was established here about the commencement of the 13th century by one of the Fitz-Hardinges (or Fitzhardinge).

Thomas de Gournay was involved with the murder of Edward II at Berkeley Castle in 1327.

There were three mills on the Land Yeo in Barrow Gurney. The Upper Barrow Mill, which had an Overshot water wheel, was a Gristmill which is known to have been operating in 1839. By 1866 it was running as a corn mill, and ceased operation by 1935. The Middle Mill was converted to snuff manufacture by Peter Lilly a tobacconist from Bristol around 1800 and became part of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills tobacco manufacturing company. It ceased mill operations by 1839 and by 1885 both the leat and millpond had disappeared. The Lower Mill is known have been grinding corn in the 19th century. It was rebuilt in 1909 when an iron overshot watermill of diameter was installed and steam power introduced. The mill is still used to produce animal feeds, however the waterwheel and millpond, which remain, are no longer in use.

Barrow Hospital (sometimes referred to as Barrow Gurney Hospital) was a psychiatric hospital which opened in the 1930s. In Second World War the hospital was commandeered by the Royal Navy and became a Royal Naval Auxiliary Hospital before being transferred to the National Health Service in 1948. In 2003 the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust announced its intention to close Barrow Hospital by 2008. In 2008 planning permission was granted build 18 luxury homes and 405,000sq ft of office space on the southern part of the site. In 2010, plans were amended to include a 220-bed care home &#x27;village&#x27; on the northern part of the site, more housing and fewer offices.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one member of parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Religious sites==

The parish Church of St Mary and St Edward and Barrow Court manor house chapel have 12th-century origins but were virtually rebuilt by Henry Woodyer 1887–90 for Henry Martin Gibbs son of William Gibbs of Tyntesfield. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

==Culture==

It is mentioned in the song &#x27;Drink up thy Zider&#x27; by The Wurzels – the reference is to going to see his brother Ernie in the Barrow Hospital.

Barrow Gurney Cricket Club was founded in 1874 and moved to its current site in Hobbs Lane in the 1950s, recent improvements to the pavilion and grounds have made it widely considered as one of the most attractive places in play cricket in North Somerset. The club currently has 2 adult teams playing in the Bristol &amp; District League and a Midweek team playing in the Bristol Midweek League. All teams are open to male and female players.

It is well known in the Bristol area as a shortcut to Bristol Airport, despite very narrow roads and heavy traffic calming measures that are clearly intended to discourage this.

<text>John the Conqueror, also known as High John de Conqueror, John, Jack, and many other folk variants, is a deity from the African-American spiritual system called hoodoo. He is associated with the roots of &quot;Ipomoea purga&quot;, the John the Conqueror root or John the Conqueroo, to which magical powers are ascribed in African-American folklore, especially among practitioners of Hoodoo . Muddy Waters mentions him as Johnny Cocheroo in the songs &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;. In &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;, the line is &quot;I think I&#x27;ll go down/To old Kansas too/I&#x27;m gonna bring back my second cousin/That little Johnny Conqueroo&quot;. This line is borrowed from the Bo Diddley song &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, to which &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; is an answer song. In &quot;I&#x27;m Your Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, it is called &quot;John De Conquer Blue&quot;.

== Use in Hoodoo ==

African-American Hoodoo practitioners place High John roots inside mojo bags for protection, victory, empowerment, good-luck, love, and protection from evil spirits. &quot;...practitioners do this out of their reverence for or worship of the spirit (or in this case, John de Conquer, who also symbolizes ties to their enslaved ancestors through the land or &#x27;soil of the South.&#x27;)&quot; ...&quot;we not only find that the spirit of John de Conquer inhabits or &#x27;possesses&#x27; a root, but he is also woven into a mojo bag that practitioners wear on their persons or store in a “secret place” of their house.&quot; The root was used during slavery in the Southern United States by enslaved African-Americans to protect from slaveholders. Frederick Douglass and Henry Bibb used the High John root to prevent whippings and protection from slaveholders. In an Arkansas slave narrative, ex-slave Marion Johnson used High John roots to conquer his enemies and receive protection from conjure.

=== Cultural appropriation ===
In the twentieth century, white drug store owners appropriated Hoodoo and put a white man on High John the Conqueror product labels. As a result, some people do not know the cultural and historical origins of the African-American folk spirit John the Conqueror had in the enslaved Black community and in present day Black American culture. In 2012, Rob Cleveland, an African-American stage performer, created a play about High John the Conqueror to demystify the folk spirit to audiences. The play focuses on John the Conqueror as an enslaved man whose spirit of resistance could never be broken and who outwitted his enslavers. The spirit of resistance in John the Conqueror encouraged enslaved people to resist their slaveholders to gain their freedom. In 2022 &quot;MadameNoire&quot;, an online magazine geared toward the lifestyles of African-American women, interviewed Black Hoodoo practitioners and they voiced their concerns about the appropriation of Hoodoo. &quot;&#x27;White-washed Hoodoo doesn’t even acknowledge John the Conqueror that much because he’s been white-washed to be the type of Spirit that helps men with their virility, help men get women, help gamblers get lucky, and he’s so much more than that...&#x27;” Storyteller Diane Ferlatte performed the African-American folk tale about High John Conqueror that tells the victories of John the Conqueror on the plantation and how he unified the slave community to escape from slavery. Ferlatte tells other African-American folk stories about Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Uncle Remus. African-American scholars explain High John the Conqueror symbolized freedom from slavery. High John the Conqueror was a trickster and was able to outsmart his enslavers.

== Folk hero ==

Sometimes, John is an African prince (son of a king of Congo), said to have ridden a giant crow called &quot;Old Familiar.&quot; He was sold as a slave in the Americas. Despite his enslavement, his spirit was never broken. He survived in folklore as a reluctant folk hero, a sort of trickster figure, because of the tricks he played to evade those who played tricks on him. Joel Chandler Harris&#x27;s Br&#x27;er Rabbit of the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; stories is a similar archetype to that of High John the Conqueror, outdoing those who would do him in. Zora Neale Hurston wrote of his adventures (&quot;High John de Conquer&quot;) in her folklore collection &quot;The Sanctified Church&quot;.

In one traditional John the Conqueror story told by Virginia Hamilton, and probably based on &quot;Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, John falls in love with the Devil&#x27;s daughter. The Devil sets John a number of impossible tasks: he must clear sixty acres (25 ha) of land in half a day and then sow it with corn and reap it in the other half a day. The Devil&#x27;s daughter furnishes John with a magical axe and plow that get these impossible tasks done, but warns John that her father the Devil means to kill him even if he performs them. John and the Devil&#x27;s daughter steal the Devil&#x27;s own horses; the Devil pursues them, but they escape his clutches by shape-shifting.

In &quot;High John De Conquer&quot;, Zora Neale Hurston reports that:

This is from Hurston&#x27;s published article in &quot;American Mercury&quot; magazine in 1943. In this article, she relates a few stories about High John, enough to define him, but not an exhaustive survey of the folklore. The purpose was to present the nation with the hope-building and the power of this inspiring figure during the darkest days of World War II. The article ends with:

==Plant information==

The root known as High John the Conqueror or John the Conqueror root is said to be the root of &quot;Ipomoea jalapa&quot;, also known as &quot;Ipomoea purga&quot;, an &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species related to the morning glory and the sweet potato. The plant is known in some areas as bindweed or jalap root. It has a pleasant, earthy odor, but it is a strong laxative if taken internally. It is not used for this purpose in folk magic; it is instead used as one of the parts of a mojo bag. It is typically used in sexual spells of various sorts and it is also considered lucky for gambling. It is likely that the root acquired its sexual magical reputation because, when dried, it resembles the testicles of a dark-skinned man. Because of this, when it is employed as an amulet, it is important that the root used be whole and unblemished. Dried pieces and chips of the root are used in formulating oils and washes that are used in other sorts of spells.

Cecil Adams has written that John the Conqueror root is the root of St. John&#x27;s wort. St. John&#x27;s wort root is a thin and thread-like root while John the Conqueror root is a tuber. John the Conqueror root is carried by the user and the spell is cast by rubbing the root, which could not be done with a filamentous root.

== Other herbs related to the legend ==

Other roots are linked to the same body of legends.

Low John is the root of the trillium or wake-robin, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;. It is carried on the person for assistance in family matters. It is also known as Dixie John or Southern John and additionally is the basis for a hoodoo formula called Dixie Love Oil.

&quot;Chewing John&quot; is galangal, &quot;Alpinia galanga&quot;, a member of the ginger family. This is chewed much as chewing tobacco is chewed, to sweeten the breath and to calm the stomach. It is said that if you spit the juice from chewing this root onto the floor of a courtroom before the judge enters, you will win your case. Other names for this root are Little John and Little John to Chew. It is called &quot;Low John&quot; in the Deep South.

<text>Mark Evan Cerny ( ; born August 24, 1964) is an American video game designer, programmer, producer and media proprietor.

Raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Cerny attended UC Berkeley before dropping out to pursue a career in video games. In his early years, he spent time at Atari, Sega, Crystal Dynamics and Universal Interactive Studios before becoming an independent consultant under his own company Cerny Games in 1998. While at Sega, he established Sega Technical Institute, working on games including &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992).

Cerny has since frequently collaborated with Sony Interactive Entertainment as a consultant, including being the lead designer for hardware of several PlayStation consoles, being called the architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4 and PS5. He has also consulted with Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games since their creation in the 1990s, as well as other Sony first-party studios like Sucker Punch Productions. He has also developed several games, notably the arcade game &quot;Marble Madness&quot; and the &quot;Knack&quot; series, and credited on many more for his consulting work.

In 2004, he was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Game Developers Association, and was inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame in 2010.

== Career ==
=== 1982–1996: First years ===
Mark Cerny grew up in San Francisco, and was a fan of computer programming and arcade games as a youth. He had attended University of California, Berkeley, but when he was 17 in 1982, he was invited to join Atari, and dropped out of school for the opportunity. He started working in Atari&#x27;s arcade division on January 18, 1982. In those earlier days of professional game development, teams were small and each member was responsible for a wider range of roles than today. He first worked with Ed Logg on &quot;Millipede&quot; and Owen Rubin on &quot;Major Havoc&quot;. &quot;Working at Atari early in my career was an experience I&#x27;ll never forget. I got to work alongside game design legends like Ed Logg, Dave Theurer, Owen Rubin, among many others, during a time when creativity, passion and competition was at a high. Ideas that were 100% original was not only expected, but demanded. As a young 18-year-old, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better introduction for my career,&quot; said Cerny.

Cerny&#x27;s first major success was the arcade game &quot;Marble Madness&quot; in which he, at age 18, acted as designer and co-programmer. During this period around 1985, he gained an interest in video game hardware, which Cerny considered far simpler than his later work with the PlayStation. By the end of the 1980s, he joined Sega, initially working at Sega&#x27;s headquarters in Japan and then returning to the United States by 1991 to help establish the Sega Technical Institute. There, he worked on various Master System and Genesis releases, most notably &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;.

Cerny left Sega in 1992 to join the newly formed Crystal Dynamics. He initially worked on 3DO games including &quot;Crash &#x27;n Burn&quot; (1993) and &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (1994). Cerny was instrumental in helping Crystal Dynamics become the first American developer to secure a PlayStation development kit from Sony Computer Entertainment, having gone to Japan to negotiate the deal with Shuhei Yoshida, at that point a young executive within Sony. While the development kit had been delivered to Crystal Dynamics by 1994, Cerny had left the studio to lead Universal Pictures&#x27; newly formed multimedia division.

=== 1996–present: Partnership with Sony ===
From 1994 to 1998, Cerny was involved with Universal Interactive Studios, a newly formed division of Universal for video games that Cerny described as a &quot;boutique publisher&quot;. Cerny was initially a vice president of product development and later became its president. Cerny had been given a good amount of freedom with the division, stating &quot;The best part about this was that Universal didn&#x27;t really know the business and as a result I had a great big bag of money to spend and no supervision&quot;. Under Cerny, Universal Interactive Studios hired in two small and new development studios to develop for the PlayStation, aided by his past connections within Sony: the three-person Naughty Dog and two-person Insomniac Games. In the case of Naughty Dog, they were brought in to build &quot;Way of the Warrior&quot; and had signed on for three additional titles. Cerny helped with their next title, &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, which Sony picked up to publish in 1996. Insomniac similarly had completed their first title &quot;Disruptor&quot; and Cerny helped them prepare the next game, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, which also was picked up and published by Sony in 1998. When Naughty Dog and Insomniac&#x27;s contracts with Universal expired, both studios signed up with Sony to continue to develop games for the PlayStation. Cerny kept in close contact with both teams afterwards. In 1998, Universal as a whole had financial issues that set a hiring freeze on the Interactive Studios group. Cerny opted to leave Universal to become consultant under his own company, Cerny Games, that would allow him to keep working with Naughty Dog, Insomniac and Sony.

Around 1999, Sony was developing the hardware for the PlayStation 2. Yoshida, now executive producer of product development, contacted Cerny about helping to develop a graphics engine for the new console. Cerny accepted, and worked in Japan over a three-month span, being the first American to work on the PlayStation 2. Once the engine was complete, Cerny helped both Naughty Dog and Insomniac with their first PlayStation 2 titles, &quot;Jak &amp; Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, respectively, as well as several sequels in both series that followed. During this period, Cerny developed his &quot;Method&quot; approach for game development from his experience on the &quot;dos and don&#x27;ts&quot; in the game industry. Cerny&#x27;s Method has since become a standard practice in the video game development industry.

Cerny would continue his consulting with Sony. In 2003, Yoshida had been promoted to vice president of product development at Sony Computer Entertainment America, where the planning of Sony&#x27;s next console the PlayStation 3 had started. Yoshida again brought Cerny to help plan out a means for the new console to share some of the same functionality as the previous consoles as to reduce the burden and cost for developers. Cerny worked with Sony and Naughty Dog to form the Initiative for a Common Engine (ICE) Team, with part of the team working directly with Sony&#x27;s hardware developers in Japan to bring about Yoshida&#x27;s vision. Ultimately the PlayStation 3&#x27;s new core hardware, the Cell, was difficult to work with, though some of the goals of the ICE Team were implemented. In addition to hardware support, Cerny continued to assist Naughty Dog and Insomniac with their first PlayStation 3 titles, &quot;&quot; from Naughty Dog, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot; for Insomniac, as well as for other Sony first-party titles, including &quot;God of War III&quot; and &quot;Killzone 3&quot;.

==== PlayStation lead architect ====
Around 2007, Sony was looking ahead to the successor to the PlayStation 3, which had not met Sony&#x27;s sales expectations in competition with Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360, and had contributed to Ken Kutaragi&#x27;s departure from Sony. A postmortem from the PlayStation 3s development revealed that either the next console would stay with the Cell processor, or move to an x86-based architecture common to personal computers. While the x86 approach would make some parts of development easier, Cerny told Sony this was currently unfavorable to the first-party developers as it would prevent them from accessing low-level functions that many used for extracting as much performance from the console. Cerny spent much of his time in November 2007 researching the history of the x86 architecture, and then proposed a plan to Yoshida for him to take on the lead development role for the next PlayStation based on what he had learned so that the next console would be developer-friendly while using the x86 architecture. Yoshida agreed, which helped to convince the upper management at Sony to allow Cerny to remain a consultant while assigned as the PlayStation 4&#x27;s lead designer. Cerny&#x27;s approach to the PlayStation 4&#x27;s design is considered significant, as it had led the console to achieve over 100 million units sold by 2019 trailing only the PlayStation 2 in lifetime sales. Alongside hardware, Cerny led development of one of the PlayStation 4&#x27;s launch games, &quot;Knack,&quot; as well as its sequel.

Cerny continued on as lead designer on Sony&#x27;s future consoles, including the handheld PlayStation Vita, and for the PlayStation 5. Cerny said that his consultant status gives him freedom that being an employee of Sony would not have, such as being able to work with multiple different groups within Sony and its first-party studios for improving the PlayStation design. He also continued to consult in game design for several of Sony&#x27;s first-party games, including &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Death Stranding&quot;. Since around 2009 and the release of the PlayStation 4, Cerny has worked on a two-year cycle where he visits most of Sony&#x27;s first-party developers and other key studios to figure out what issues they have with the current hardware and what they would like to see out of future hardware. These visits may lead to mid-generation improvements in hardware revisions or improved software, or have been used to inform the direction of the next generation of hardware.

== The Method process ==
Cerny established the Method process in 2002 while consulting with Naughty Dog, Insomniac, and other Sony first-party studios. Cerny observed that there were completely different approaches needed in the preproduction stage and the production stage of video game development, and that it was impossible to put a timeline on the creative process. He suggested that the pre-production stage should be freeform, allowing the creative persons to explore a game&#x27;s viability prior to full development. The end product of the preproduction stage under the Method process should be a &quot;publishable first playable&quot; version of the game that can be used to determine the viability of the title. This version does not need to be content-complete but provide enough to be used in playtesting from potential consumers. If the game at this state does not excite players, then the game idea should be set aside before too much effort is put into it. Once the decision is made to move forward on the game, then Cerny recommends by the Method that the typical use of scheduled milestones and deliverables to keep the project on track.

== Personal life ==
While working under Sega in Japan during the 1980s and 1990s, Cerny learned Japanese. He met his future wife in Japan, who helped him to establish Cerny Games, which she continues to manage to this day. He is of Czech descent.

== Accolades ==
The International Game Developers Association awarded Cerny with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards (IGDA) in 2004. IGDA stated, &quot;It&#x27;s rare to find a &#x27;jack-of-all-trades&#x27; who not only has the high-level vision for great game design but can act as the glue to adhere all the pieces together. His unusual but highly effective methodology has brought us some of the most entertaining games in history.&quot; He was described as &quot;a master collaborator&quot;. His &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; and &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; games have collectively sold more than 30 million units.

In 2010, at the 13th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, Mark Cerny was inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. &quot;Mark Cerny is the closest we have come to a modern-day Da Vinci,&quot; said Joseph Olin, then-president of the AIAS. &quot;What he does isn&#x27;t restricted to a single aspect of game creation, he really is a Renaissance man. He is a diversely accomplished game designer, producer, programmer and technologist, fluent in Japanese and one of the foremost Western experts on the Japanese game market. He is also one of the only top-level independents in a business dominated by institutions.&quot;

<doc id="1089943" wikidata="Q46000" url="?curid=1089943" title="Thomas J. Watson Jr.">
<text>Thomas John Watson Jr. (January 14, 1914 – December 31, 1993) was an American businessman, diplomat, Army Air Forces pilot, and philanthropist. The son of IBM Corporation founder Thomas J. Watson, he was the second IBM president (1952–71), the 11th national president of the Boy Scouts of America (1964–68), and the 16th United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1979–81). He received many honors during his lifetime, including being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. &quot;Fortune&quot; called him &quot;the greatest capitalist in history&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; listed him as one of &quot;100 most influential people of the 20th century&quot;.

==Early life==
Thomas Watson Jr. was born on January 14, 1914, just before his father, Thomas J. Watson, was dismissed from his job at cash register company NCR – an act which subsequently drove Watson Sr., to the foundation of the largest and most profitable digital computer manufacturer in the world, IBM Corporation. Two sisters followed Thomas Jr., Jane and Helen, before a final child, Arthur Kittredge Watson, was born.

Watson Jr. was raised in the Short Hills section of Millburn, New Jersey.

Both sons were immersed in IBM from a very early age. He was taken on plant inspections – his first memory of such a visit (to the Dayton, Ohio factory) was at the age of five – and business tours to Europe and made appearances at annual gatherings for the company&#x27;s elite sales representatives, the IBM Hundred Per Cent Club, even before he was old enough to attend school.

At home his father&#x27;s discipline was erratic and often harsh. Around the time he was thirteen, Watson suffered from clinical depression.

Talking to a reporter in 1974, Watson described his relationship with his father; &quot;My father and I had terrible fights ... He seemed like a blanket that covered everything. I really wanted to beat him but also make him proud of me.&quot; But this relationship was not all negative: &quot;I really enjoyed the ten years (working) with him&quot;. In his book he says; &quot;I was so intimately entwined with my father. I had a compelling desire, maybe out of honor for the old gentleman, maybe out of sheer cussedness, to prove to the world that I could excel in the same way that he did.&quot;

Watson attended the Hun School of Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey. He claimed in his autobiography that as a child he had a &quot;strange defect in his vision&quot; that made written words appear to fall off the page when he tried to read them. As a result, Watson struggled in school, and he acknowledged that Brown University reluctantly admitted him as a favor to his father. He graduated with a business degree in 1937.

After graduating, Watson became a salesman for IBM but had little interest in the job. The turning point was his service as a pilot in the Army Air Forces during World War II. His brother &quot;Dick&quot; (Arthur) Watson had dropped out of Yale. Watson became a lieutenant colonel, tasked with flying military commanders. Tom Jr. later admitted to journalists that the one career he would have liked to follow was an airline pilot. Piloting came easily to him and for the first time, he had confidence in his abilities. Toward the end of his service, Watson worked for Major General Follett Bradley, who suggested that he should try to follow his father at IBM. Watson regularly flew Bradley, the director of lend-lease programs to the Soviet Union, to Moscow during the war. On these trips, he learned Russian, which would later serve him well as the American Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Watson and Bradley were instrumental in establishing the ALSIB-Northwest Staging Route to send military aircraft from the United States to the Soviet Union.

Watson returned to IBM at the beginning of 1946. He was promoted to be a vice president just six months later and was promoted to the board just four months after that. He became Executive Vice-president in 1949.

==IBM president==
Watson became president of IBM in 1952 and was named as the company&#x27;s CEO shortly before the death of his father, Watson Sr., in 1956. Up to this time IBM was dedicated to electromechanical punched card systems for its commercial products.
Watson Sr. had repeatedly rejected electronic computers as overpriced and unreliable, except for one-of-a-kind projects such as the IBM SSEC.
Tom Jr. took the company in a new direction, hiring electrical engineers by the hundreds and putting them to work designing mainframe computers.
Many of IBM&#x27;s technical experts also did not think computer products were practical since there were only about a dozen computers in the entire world at the time. Even the supporters of the new technology underestimated the potential. Cuthbert Hurd, brought in from the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to determine if there was a market, predicted &quot;... he could find customers for as many as thirty machines.&quot;

Even so, until the late 1950s the custom-built US Air Force SAGE computerized tracking system accounted for more than half of IBM&#x27;s computer sales. The company made little profit on these sales but, as Tom Jr. said &quot;It enabled us to build highly automated factories ahead of anybody else, and to train thousands of new workers in electronics.&quot;

Tom Jr.&#x27;s decision was justified; in the longer term, it redirected IBM to its later position dominating the computer market. Even in the short term it paid off; for revenues more than tripled in six years, from $214.9 million in 1950 to $734.3 million in 1956. This dramatic rate of growth almost matched the wartime years; a better than 30% compound growth rate that Tom Jr. maintained for much of the twenty years of his leadership of IBM. It was a record even better than that of his father.

Despite the presence of his son, Thomas Sr. kept a firm grip on the reins until 1955. Tom Jr. described the position of his father as &quot;He wanted to make me head of IBM, but he didn&#x27;t like sharing the limelight.&quot;

Tom Jr. took over effective control in a dramatic moment; though the formal handover took place a few months later. The occasion was signing the Consent Decree which was offered by the government after its latest anti-trust investigation. Tom Jr. saw that the Consent Decree, which sought to strip IBM of half its card-making capacity, was largely irrelevant since the future was in computers rather than cards. There was another condition: IBM had to sell machines outright as well as lease them. This had repercussions in the late 1960s when leasing companies recognized the financing loophole that it created.

Behind this decision was another: spending more on research and development. IBM was only spending 3% on research and development at that time when other high technology companies were spending between 6% and 9%. Tom Jr. learned the lesson, and thereafter – at least until the 1990s (when, even then, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. only dropped it to 6%) – IBM consistently spent 9%. By comparison, the equivalent figure for Japan was 5.1%, though its high technology companies exceeded even the IBM level, with the 1983 spending for Canon being 14.6% and that for NEC being 13.0%.

This training program was to take him, over the next five years, through many of IBM&#x27;s operating groups. Tom Jr. believed his most important influence was Albert Lynn Williams, a CPA, who became president of IBM in 1961.
Although the initiative, and as such much of the credit for the birth of the information revolution, must go to Tom Jr., considerable courage was also displayed by his then aging father who, despite his long commitment to internal funding, backed his son to the hilt; reportedly with the words &quot;It is harder to keep a business great than it is to build it.&quot;

In 1968, Tom Jr. fired computer scientist Lynn Conway because he feared the news of her transition would affect the company&#x27;s reputation.

==Research and development==
Prior to his time, IBM had primarily emphasized the sales organization, with a reasonable range of products. Tom Watson Jr., however, promoted a research and development structure.

The first result of this was the IBM 7030 Stretch program to develop a transistorized &quot;supercomputer&quot;; it failed to meet its price and performance goals, at a reported cost of $20 million. Although embarrassing in terms of the rumors that drifted to the outside world, it would not however be the last IBM computer series to be terminated and the cost was small in IBM&#x27;s terms; and the experience gained was invaluable.

The three computer families that eventually emerged from 1958 onwards comprised the IBM 7070 and IBM 7090 for large government business and large businesses, the IBM 1620 for smaller customers in the scientific community, and the IBM 1401 for commercial use by smaller organizations. Despite the fact that many observers believed that Tom Jr was frittering away the resources his father had built up, these new ranges were remarkably successful, doubling IBM&#x27;s sales once more over the six years from 1958 ($1.17 billion) to 1964 ($2.31 billion), maintaining IBM&#x27;s dramatic growth rate virtually undiminished at approaching 30% compound. The effect was that IBM had become independent of outside funding.

In the early 1960s he oversaw the IBM System/360 project, which produced an entire line of computers that ran the same software and used the same peripherals. Since the 360 line was incompatible with IBM&#x27;s previous products, it represented an enormous risk for the company. Despite delays in shipment, the products were well-received following their launch in 1964 and what &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine called &quot;IBM&#x27;s $5 Billion Gamble,&quot; in the end, paid off.

==Organizational structures==
Perhaps Watson&#x27;s most enduring contribution to IBM was its organizational structure, since new products, no matter how successful, carry a company for at most a few years. In 1956, in a move that became a bi-annual event, he reorganized IBM on divisional lines, to give a decentralized organization, with five major divisions in the US. The new structure comprised:

#Data Processing Division – selling to (and servicing) commercial customers
#Federal Systems Division – selling to (and servicing) the US government
#Systems Manufacturing Division
#Components Manufacturing Division
#Research Division

Smaller units were Electric Typewriter, IBM World Trade, Service Bureau Corporation, Supplies Division; and Time Division (sold off in 1958).
Watson said &quot;We had a superb sales organization but lacked expert management organization in almost everything else&quot;. His goal was to redirect IBM to absorb the shocks of change, including change from its own innovation.

He introduced the terminology &quot;line and staff&quot;. In his words: &quot;By the mid-&#x27;50s just about every big corporation had adopted the so-called staff-and-line structure. It was modeled on military organizations going back to the Prussian army in Napoleonic times.&quot;
His organization &quot;... provided IBM executives with the clearest possible goals. Each operating man was judged strictly on his unit&#x27;s results, and each staff man on his effort toward making IBM the world leader in his specialty.&quot;

The final element of formal organizational change was the isolation of headquarters staff in Armonk, New York. This was said by him to be in order to be near his family in Connecticut.

His first book in 1963 discussed his management philosophy.

==Honors==
Watson received the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 1955 for his service to youth. He was the national president of the BSA from 1964 to 1968. His father had also served on the national executive board and was International Commissioner in the 1940s.

Lyndon B. Johnson in September 1964 awarded Watson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest award a U.S. president can bestow on a civilian.

Watson was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1976.
He was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1967.
In 1987 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine hailed Watson on its cover as &quot;the greatest capitalist in history.&quot;
In 1998 he was included on TIME Magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

==Retirement==

Watson left IBM in 1971 on his doctor&#x27;s advice after having a heart attack. After recovering, he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be chairman of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) on Arms Control and Disarmament, in support of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency which had been previously set up by President John F. Kennedy. Watson advised President Carter against use of the experimental MX missile. After leaving the GAC, he was appointed by President Carter to be the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, serving from October 29, 1979, to January 15, 1981.

Following his return home after Carter&#x27;s defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 United States presidential election, Watson gave the commencement speech at Harvard University in 1981 in which he warned against further escalation against the USSR. He was also a member of the Bohemian Club.

He was an avid sailor and pilot. He named 7 successive sailboats after Palawan, the last in 1991. Watson sailed one of his &quot;Palawans&quot; farther up the northern coast of Greenland than any non-military ship had done previously, receiving the New York Yacht Club&#x27;s highest award and the Cruising Club of America&#x27;s Blue Water Medal. He traveled the route of Captain Cook in exploring the Pacific. He flew helicopters, jets, and stunt planes, and was the first private citizen to receive permission from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to fly across the Soviet Union, recreating in 1987 the ALSIB route from World War II.

==Personal life==
Watson married Olive Cawley (1918–2004) in 1941. They had six children.

He had homes in Greenwich, Connecticut; North Haven, Maine; Stowe, Vermont; Vail, Colorado; New York City; and Antigua. He died in Greenwich on December 31, 1993, of complications following a stroke. He was 79.

==Philanthropy==
Watson was the principal benefactor of the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University and the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship (which supports students to study a topic of personal interest for a year) and other charitable gifts.
Watson contributed to the Watson Pavilion at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, which named the Olive and Thomas J. Watson Jr. Pavilion (a wing) after him and his wife. He was also the principal benefactor of Owls Head Transportation Museum in Owls Head, Maine. He was on the board of directors of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and helped bring a factory employing over 300 people to the community that made cables, including ones for the US space program.

===Columbia University===
After leaving IBM, Watson donated tens of millions of dollars to Columbia University from 1975 onward. These included the Thomas J. Watson Library of Business and Economics and several smaller building grants.
Watson funded a Columbia East Campus residence hall named Watson House.
