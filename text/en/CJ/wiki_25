<text>Ethanol fermentation, also called alcoholic fermentation, is a biological process which converts sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose into cellular energy, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as by-products. Because yeasts perform this conversion in the absence of oxygen, alcoholic fermentation is considered an anaerobic process. It also takes place in some species of fish (including goldfish and carp) where (along with lactic acid fermentation) it provides energy when oxygen is scarce.

Ethanol fermentation is the basis for alcoholic beverages, ethanol fuel and bread dough rising.

==Biochemical process of fermentation of sucrose==

The chemical equations below summarize the fermentation of sucrose (C12H22O11) into ethanol (C2H5OH). Alcoholic fermentation converts one mole of glucose into two moles of ethanol and two moles of carbon dioxide, producing two moles of ATP in the process.

:C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2 + 2 ATP

Sucrose is a sugar composed of a glucose linked to a fructose. In the first step of alcoholic fermentation, the enzyme invertase cleaves the glycosidic linkage between the glucose and fructose molecules.

: &lt;chem&gt; C12H22O11{} + H2O -&gt;[\text{Invertase}] 2 C6H12O6 &lt;/chem&gt;

Next, each glucose molecule is broken down into two pyruvate molecules in a process known as glycolysis. Glycolysis is summarized by the equation:

:C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + 2 Pi + 2 NAD+ → 2 CH3COCOO− + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H2O + 2 H+

CH3COCOO− is pyruvate, and Pi is inorganic phosphate. Finally, pyruvate is converted to ethanol and CO2 in two steps, regenerating oxidized NAD+ needed for glycolysis:
:1. CH3COCOO− + H+ → CH3CHO + CO2
catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase
:2. CH3CHO + NADH + H+ → C2H5OH + NAD+

This reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1 in baker&#x27;s yeast).

As shown by the reaction equation, glycolysis causes the reduction of two molecules of NAD+ to NADH. Two ADP molecules are also converted to two ATP and two water molecules via substrate-level phosphorylation.

===Related processes===

Fermentation of sugar to ethanol and can also be done by &quot;Zymomonas mobilis&quot;, however the path is slightly different since formation of pyruvate does not happen by glycolysis but instead by the Entner–Doudoroff pathway.
Other microorganisms can produce ethanol from sugars by fermentation but often only as a side product. Examples are
* Heterolactic acid fermentation in which Leuconostoc bacteria produce lactate + ethanol + 
* Mixed acid fermentation where Escherichia produce ethanol mixed with lactate, acetate, succinate, formate, , and H2
* 2,3-butanediol fermentation by Enterobacter producing ethanol, butanediol, lactate, formate, , and H2

==Effect of oxygen==
Fermentation does not require oxygen. If oxygen is present, some species of yeast (e.g., &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot; or &quot;Kluyveromyces lipolytica&quot;) will oxidize pyruvate completely to carbon dioxide and water in a process called cellular respiration, hence these species of yeast will produce ethanol only in an anaerobic environment (not cellular respiration). This phenomenon is known as the Pasteur effect.

However, many yeasts such as the commonly used baker&#x27;s yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; or fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; under certain conditions, ferment rather than respire even in the presence of oxygen. In wine making this is known as the counter-Pasteur effect. These yeasts will produce ethanol even under aerobic conditions, if they are provided with the right kind of nutrition. During batch fermentation, the rate of ethanol production per milligram of cell protein is maximal for a brief period early in this process and declines progressively as ethanol accumulates in the surrounding broth. Studies demonstrate that the removal of this accumulated ethanol does not immediately restore fermentative activity, and they provide evidence that the decline in metabolic rate is due to physiological changes (including possible ethanol damage) rather than to the presence of ethanol. Several potential causes for the decline in fermentative activity have been investigated. Viability remained at or above 90%, internal pH remained near neutrality, and the specific activities of the glycolytic and alcohologenic enzymes (measured in vitro) remained high throughout batch fermentation. None of these factors appears to be causally related to the fall in fermentative activity during batch fermentation.

==Bread baking==
Ethanol fermentation causes bread dough to rise. Yeast organisms consume sugars in the dough and produce ethanol and carbon dioxide as waste products. The carbon dioxide forms bubbles in the dough, expanding it to a foam. Less than 2% ethanol remains after baking.

In a contemporary advancement, a group in Germany has been doing the opposite and converting stale bread into ethanol.

==Alcoholic beverages==

Ethanol contained in alcoholic beverages is produced by means of fermentation induced by yeast. Liquors are distilled from grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation.

Alcohol products:
* Natural sugars present in grapes;
** Fermented: Wine, cider and perry are produced by similar fermentation of natural sugar in apples and pears, respectively; and other fruit wines are produced from the fermentation of the sugars in any other kinds of fruit.
** Liquors: Brandy and eaux de vie (e.g. slivovitz) are produced by distillation of these fruit-fermented beverages.
* Mead is produced by fermentation of the natural sugars present in honey.
* Grain starches that have been converted to sugar by the enzyme amylase, which is present in grain kernels that have been malted (i.e. germinated). Other sources of starch (e.g. potatoes and unmalted grain) may be added to the mixture, as the amylase will act on those starches as well. It may also be amylase-induce fermented with saliva in a few countries. 
** Fermented: Beer
** Liquors: Whiskey, and sometimes vodka. Gin and related beverages are produced by the addition of flavoring agents to a vodka-like feedstock during distillation.
* Rice grain starches converted to sugar by the mold &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;.
** Fermented: Rice wines (including sake) 
** Liquors: &quot;Baijiu&quot;, &quot;soju&quot;, and &quot;shōchū&quot;
* Sugarcane product molasses.
** Liquors: Rum

In all cases, fermentation must take place in a vessel (e.g. a fermentation lock) that allows carbon dioxide to escape and prevents outside air from coming in. This is because letting in outside air could contaminate the brew due to risk of bacteria or mold, and a buildup of carbon dioxide could cause the vessel to rupture.

==Feedstocks for fuel production==
Yeast fermentation of various carbohydrate products is also used to produce the ethanol that is added to gasoline.

The dominant ethanol feedstock in warmer regions is sugarcane. In temperate regions, corn or sugar beets are used.

In the United States, the main feedstock for the production of ethanol is currently corn. Approximately 2.8 gallons of ethanol are produced from one bushel of corn (0.42 liter per kilogram). While much of the corn turns into ethanol, some of the corn also yields by-products such as DDGS (distillers dried grains with solubles) that can be used as feed for livestock. A bushel of corn produces about 18 pounds of DDGS (320 kilograms of DDGS per metric ton of maize). Although most of the fermentation plants have been built in corn-producing regions, sorghum is also an important feedstock for ethanol production in the Plains states. Pearl millet is showing promise as an ethanol feedstock for the southeastern U.S. and the potential of duckweed is being studied.

In some parts of Europe, particularly France and Italy, grapes have become a &quot;de facto&quot; feedstock for fuel ethanol by the distillation of surplus wine. Surplus sugary drinks may also be used. In Japan, it has been proposed to use rice normally made into sake as an ethanol source.

===Cassava as ethanol feedstock===
Ethanol can be made from mineral oil or from sugars or starches. Starches are cheapest. The starchy crop with highest energy content per acre is cassava, which grows in tropical countries.

Thailand already had a large cassava industry in the 1990s, for use as cattle feed and as a cheap admixture to wheat flour. Nigeria and Ghana are already establishing cassava-to-ethanol plants. Production of ethanol from cassava is currently economically feasible when crude oil prices are above US$120 per barrel.

New varieties of cassava are being developed, so the future situation remains uncertain.
Currently, cassava can yield between 25 and 40 tonnes per hectare (with irrigation and fertilizer), and from a tonne of cassava roots, circa 200 liters of ethanol can be produced (assuming cassava with 22% starch content). A liter of ethanol contains circa 21.46 MJ of energy. The overall energy efficiency of cassava-root to ethanol conversion is circa 32%.

The yeast used for processing cassava is &quot;Endomycopsis fibuligera&quot;, sometimes used together with bacterium &quot;Zymomonas mobilis&quot;.

==Byproducts of fermentation==
Ethanol fermentation produces unharvested byproducts such as heat, carbon dioxide, food for livestock, water, methanol, fuels, fertilizer and alcohols. The cereal unfermented solid residues from the fermentation process, which can be used as livestock feed or in the production of biogas, are referred to as Distillers grains and sold as WDG, &quot;Wet Distiller&#x27;s grains&quot;, and DDGS, &quot;Dried Distiller&#x27;s Grains with Solubles&quot;, respectively.

<text>In international relations, the concept of balancing derives from the balance of power theory, the most influential theory from the realist school of thought, which assumes that a formation of hegemony in a multistate system is unattainable since hegemony is perceived as a threat by other states, causing them to engage in balancing against a potential hegemon.

Balancing encompasses the actions that a particular state or group of states take in order to equalise the odds against more powerful states; that is to make it more difficult and hence less likely for powerful states to exert their military advantage over the weaker ones.

According to the balance of power theory, states, motivated primarily by their desire for survival and security, will develop and implement military capabilities and hard power mechanisms in order to constrain the most powerful and rising state that can prove a potential threat. This idea illustrates the concept of internal balancing, which is opposed to external, under which states come together and form an alliance to balance and gain more leverage over a dominant or rising power. In recent years, soft-balancing has emerged as a new concept of illustrating how states balance powerful actors, which advocates the use of economic and diplomatic tools to constrain the most powerful state and inhibit their exertion of power and dominance.

==Theoretical origins==
Balancing behaviour of states is prompted by the structural characteristics of the balance of power system itself. This belief is strongly perpetrated by theorists of neorealism or structural realism, namely Kenneth Waltz who is one of the earliest and most significant contributors to neorealism and balance of power theory.

Neorealist theory makes a few assumptions about the system, the interests and motives of the actors within it and the constraints that all states face, which ultimately lead to behaviours such as balancing.

The first assumption is that international order is anarchic, which is a primary cause of the balancing behaviour of states. Anarchy, or the lack of an overarching law enforcing body, inevitably forces states to rely on their individual resources and actions to assure their welfare, whereby it becomes a responsibility and a requirement of each state to look out for its own survival and security and show readiness in countering force and aggression from other actors.

The second assumption is that the primary goal of all actors is their own survival. At a minimum, they simply strive for their own preservation, while others may have more expansionist motives and seek universal domination. Balancing, hence, becomes a tool by which states use the means available to them to achieve their goals and interests; that is to protect themselves from a more threatening actor or to further their power and capability. This leads to the notion of self-help which is labelled the principal action of all actors under the anarchic order. States must rely on their own means and arrangements in order to assure their security - that is act in their own self-interest in order to avoid falling victim to a more powerful state. This inevitably leads states to behave in ways prescribed by the balance of power.

The third assumption is the relative nature of power. The key to security and survival of each state is power, not as an absolute concept, but rather in relations to that of other states, and balancing can often be used as a mechanism of gaining a greater share of power or decreasing the share of power possessed by another state.

==Traditional forms==
Balancing can be carried out through internal or external efforts and means. Internal balancing involves efforts to enhance state&#x27;s power by increasing one&#x27;s economic resources and military strength in order to be able to rely on independent capabilities in response to a potential hegemon and be able to compete more effectively in the international system. In a self-help, anarchic system, mechanisms of internal balancing are believed to be more reliable and precise than external balancing since they rest on independent strategies and actions.

External balancing involves strengthening and enlarging one&#x27;s alliances and interstate cooperation in order to prevent a hegemon or counter a rising power. In face of a common threat and a single dominant state with a potential to jeopardise collective security and survival, states are expected to put aside their secondary disputes and join a balancing alliance. External balancing represents an alliance arrangement whereby states join in opposition to a stronger state that is perceived as a source of danger, making this kind of balancing a measure of assuring security through combined opposition to an aggressor or a potential hegemon who can endanger the wellbeing and survival of smaller powers.

In the balance of power system, balancing is opposed to the concept of bandwagoning, whereby smaller states seek to achieve their security by allying with the major power or a dominant actor. As tempting as this option may be for smaller powers, it can essentially undermine the security of the international system because by joining an alliance with a rising, potentially expansionist state, aggression and expansionist motives are being rewarded and accepted. It is in the interest of states to form coalitions with others with similar or lesser power in order to build their defensive and deterrent capabilities and through this discourage and prevent a growing power from becoming too strong and dominant. Afterall, as Waltz summed it up, &quot;states... flock to the weaker side, for it is the stronger side that threatens them&quot;.

==Why states balance==
States balance in order to avoid being dominated by stronger powers. It is in the interest of states to curb a potential hegemon before it becomes too powerful so that they avoid falling victim to its rule once it achieves a dominant power status. It becomes a safer alternative to either improve one&#x27;s own capabilities through self-help mechanisms or join alliances with states who cannot readily dominate in order to restrain and curb the one who can potentially dominate the system and undermine the survival of actors within it.

Another reason why states in a majority of instances choose to balance and not bandwagon is because joining the balancing alliance allows them to have more influence and play a more important role in that alliance, whereas the alliance with a major power would not allow them opportunities for a great deal of contribution and decisive capability as they would inevitably be dominated by their powerful ally. States prefer to preserve their freedom of action in an alliance rather than have orders imposed on them by aligning with a potential hegemon. If states are extremely vulnerable and insignificant, bandwagoning may be their only choice, however middle powers and states that have something to contribute and protect will always balance in face of a rising power and a potential hegemon

There are a number of factors that influence the decision of states to balance or bandwagon, as proposed by Stephen Walt in his account on alliance formation. First is aggregate power, which constitutes state&#x27;s resources and capabilities. This particular factor can provoke balancing, in that a state with high aggregate power is a potential threat and can evoke fears of domination in smaller powers, but it can just as easily lead to bandwagoning as smaller states might be attracted to power and protection from a strong ally. The second factor is proximate power, whereby geographically close states pose a greater threat than distant ones as the ability to project power declines with distance. Once again, an aggressive and increasingly powerful neighbouring state is likely to alarm other states to engage in balancing strategies against it, however small, weak and vulnerable states neighbouring a great power are often prone to balancing due to the lack of viable alternatives, inability to balance independently or contribute to a balancing alliance. Offensive power is the third factor, which conveys that states with large and growing offensive capabilities are likely to provoke other to balance against them. The fourth factor concerns offensive intentions, where perceived aggressive or expansionist goals or motives of a state lead others to balance against it.

Traditionally, balancing prevailed in understanding the behaviour of states in face of hegemony, as well as in understanding how alliances come together. However, it is tough to dispute the growing trend towards bandwagoning rather than balancing exhibited over the recent decades of United States (U.S.) prevalence. This trend has shown that, whether for purposes of seeking protection or out of fear, states are choosing to ally with the superpower and accept the conditions its inflicts onto the international system.

==Failures and criticisms==
Both internal and external forms of balancing encounter a fair share of obstacles, problems and criticisms. Internal balancing is subjected to a number of domestic obstacles that can impede its success. High costs associated with it and the difficult task of allocating resources to be able to make significant contributions to one&#x27;s economic and military development are among the main ones. Furthermore, independently balancing a major power would require major expansion of one&#x27;s capabilities and accelerated rearmament, which would undoubtedly provoke unfavourable responses from not just the major power in question but also other states. A state that adopts a strategy of military buildup to increase its security and balance a rising power may inadvertently do the very opposite and create unfavourable conditions for all in the international system. It can inevitably cause a security dilemma, whereby the increase in power and security of one state decreases that of another and offsets offensive actions, potential arms races and escalating hostility among actors, hindering collective security.

External balancing, even though it is a more commonly practiced form of balancing, encounters a variety of obstacles and criticisms. Its success is contingent on an enduring and coherent alliance system, however given the structural constraints of the international system, this might be difficult to attain and ensure. The anarchic nature of the international system together with the states&#x27; primary goal of survival intrinsically causes a self-help approach from all states, whereby reliance and trust on other actors are significantly undermined. Alliances do, however, form despite these structural impediments, but they are seen as temporary arrangements that should not be overly relied upon.

The international system is subjected to the enduring conditions of insecurity and uncertainty about the intentions and actions of actors within it which makes cooperation difficult to achieve and maintain. Furthermore, external balancing is caught in the problematique of the &#x27;game of coordination&#x27; and a collective action problem in which it is difficult to sustain long term cooperation, dedications and equal contributions to the cause. There are powerful incentives to free-ride on the efforts of others and in this way avoid costs and risks while enjoying the alliance benefits.

Since individual actors in the alliance have the same interest and goal in mind, to balance the major, rising power, it should logically follow that everyone in that alliance will act on behalf of the common interest and objective. However, even though there is an expectation to share the costs and efforts of achieving a common goal, alliances and groups demonstrate a tendency towards exploitation and inconsistent dedication and input among participants. Mancur Olson, one of the leading theorists on collective action identified that despite all the members sharing a common interest, groups (or alliances for this purpose) lack a common interest in paying the costs of achieving a collective benefit, making it problematic to achieve the ends and difficult to maintain the alliance.

However, the main critique surrounding balance of power theory and subsequently balancing behaviour of states highlights that this logic applies to and concerns the period of the rise of hegemon: states will come together and balance a rising power that has potential or demonstrates ambitions towards becoming a hegemon, while saying very little and making no predictions about the occurrences once hegemony is already established.

As such, this theory and predicament of state behaviour falls short of explaining occurrences on today&#x27;s world frontier. At present, the US enjoys a well established primacy, with power and capabilities greatly superior than that of other states. At no other period in history was the margin of dominance of one state over others so extensive, making the traditional application of balance of power theory and predictions of balancing behaviour from secondary powers inapplicable.

==Today: soft-balancing argument==
Kenneth Waltz proposed that unipolarity is the most unstable and the &quot;least durable of all international configurations&quot;, since even if the dominant power acts benevolently, secondary powers will need to remain cautious about its future intentions and actions in the absence of checks and balances and an equal power to balance and restrain it. Historical instances of great unbalanced power, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon I&#x27;s rule of France or Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rule of Germany, saw aggressive and expansionist motives with aims to conquer and dominate, hence provoking the crucial need for balancing in an instance of a single dominant state in order to bring the international distribution of power into balance.

In today&#x27;s unipolar world, given the problems and difficulties associated with both internal and external forms of hard balancing, soft balancing has surfaced as a more favourable option for secondary powers to, through non-military tools, attempt to &quot;delay, frustrate and undermine&quot; actions, strategies and unilateral decisions of the unipolar leader, the United States. Advocates of soft balancing have proposed a number of mechanisms through which states engage in this form of balancing, including diplomacy, diplomatic coalitions, international institutions and agreements, statecraft mechanisms such as territorial denial, as well as economic initiatives and multilateral and regional economic endeavours that exclude the superpower in the process.

The U.S. pre-eminence has not been balanced against over the last decades mainly because the superpower exhibited non-aggressive approaches without seeking to dominate or challenge the sovereign existence of others but rather promote security and autonomy of all. However, it is argued that increasing U.S. unilateralism, especially under the Bush administration, has changed its image of a benign superpower and made foreign governments uneasy regarding its ambitions. A number of aggressive and unilateral foreign policies, most significant ones being the abandonment of Kyoto Protocol, withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and most importantly the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 despite great opposition from other states have led secondary powers to pursue indirect, soft-balancing strategies towards constraining the U.S. power and preventing it from becoming an &quot;unrestricted global hegemon&quot;.

The Iraq invasion is often used as one of the key incidents that provoked major states to rethink their own security and resort to soft balancing against the unipole since it proved not simply a strategy aimed at stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons by rogue states but rather a challenge to the norm of territorial integrity – an aggressive U.S. intervention into a region outside of its own that demonstrated the U.S. commitment to taking any necessary actions to ensure that their superiority and primacy is not challenged by anyone.

==Future==
The notion of soft-balancing, while relatively new and not universally accepted, is shaping up to be the way in which states will engage in balancing in the future. Even though it is unlikely to bring any substantial changes to the balance of power within the international realm, it does show potential in constraining the major power and allowing secondary powers to have their input in international affairs and maintain their autonomy under the dominance of a unipolar leader.

However, this is not to say that traditional, hard balancing is a thing of the past. Indeed, some powerful arguments are emerging both from the political and academic realms pointing to the rapid emergence of rising powers, namely China and India, as balancers and competitors of the U.S. in a bid for power, dominance and ultimately hegemony. For robust critics on soft balancing and unipolar stability, see Dall&#x27;Agnol. The author&#x27;s main argument is that balance of power, as proposed by Waltz, still applies to the post-Cold War era.

China is undoubtedly surfacing as the most credible power, one with the greatest potential over the next decade or two to alter the balance of power away from U.S. primacy. China has come through as a &quot;formidable political, strategic and economic competitor&quot; to the United States, increasingly challenging its regional and global leadership. Despite claims of peaceful rise mainly focused on economic prosperity, the world is becoming increasingly aware and anxious of China&#x27;s military expansion and modernisation, with its military budget rising 17.5 percent in 2008 and 18.5 percent in 2009 over the previous year. Seeing how China&#x27;s economic and military growth corresponds to the logic of internal balancing, it comes as no surprise that its claim of &quot;peaceful growth&quot; is increasingly being suspected of implying a challenge to the current world order and balance of power. In addition, soft-balancing mechanisms can also be detected, as the growth in regional partnerships and agreements has offset a new regional integration with China at its centre where the U.S. is excluded from participation, the most significant example being the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area established since January 2010. The emergence of new major powers is certain to bring changes to the balance of power dynamics regardless of the level and intensity at which these powers choose to balance the unipolar leader. Even if China and other growing states refrain from balancing the U.S., the sheer size of their economy, capability and military strength will undoubtedly pose certain constraints on the U.S. freedom of strategic action, ability to influence, dominate and project power in the future.

<doc id="1088294" wikidata="Q598829" url="?curid=1088294" title="Demographics of sexual orientation">
<text>Obtaining precise numbers on the demographics of sexual orientation is difficult for a variety of reasons, including the nature of the research questions. Most of the studies on sexual orientation rely on self-reported data, which may pose challenges to researchers because of the subject matter&#x27;s sensitivity. The studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions, while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Overall, fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Survey type, questions and survey setting may affect the respondents&#x27; answers.

== General findings ==
A 2016 literature review stated that &quot;in all cultures the vast majority of individuals are sexually predisposed exclusively to the other sex (i.e., heterosexual) and that only a minority of individuals are sexually predisposed (whether exclusively or non-exclusively) to the same sex.&quot; They state that there is no persuasive evidence that the demographics of sexual orientation have varied much across time or place. Bisexuality comes in varying degrees of relative attraction to the same or opposite sex. Men are more likely to be exclusively homosexual than to be equally attracted to both sexes, while the opposite is true for women.

Surveys in Western cultures find, on average, that about 93% of men and 87% of women identify as completely heterosexual, 4% of men and 10% of women as mostly heterosexual, 0.5% of men and 1% of women as evenly bisexual, 0.5% of men and 0.5% of women as mostly homosexual, and 2% of men and 0.5% of women as completely homosexual. An analysis of 67 studies found that the lifetime prevalence of sex between men (regardless of orientation) was 3–5% for East Asia, 6–12% for South and South East Asia, 6–15% for Eastern Europe, and 6–20% for Latin America. The International HIV/AIDS Alliance estimates a worldwide prevalence of men who have sex with men between 3 and 16 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;International HIV/AIDS Alliance 2003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimating the demographics of sexual orientation on a global scale is a difficult task, because in many parts of the world discrimination has led people to conceal their sexual identities. Some cross-cultural research has suggested that male homosexuality is more prevalent in stratified societies and may not be a cultural universal, but the empirical findings, conceptual basis, and methodology of such research has been disputed by other cross-cultural researchers.

A small number of people do not feel sexual attraction and identify as asexual, which can be considered a sexual orientation in itself or a lack thereof.

== By country ==
===Worldwide===

==== 2021 ====
In 2021, Ipsos interviewed people in 27 countries spanning all continents on their sexual orientation and gender identity. For some countries the samples were weighed for representativity, but in others with less internet access, they skewed more urban. In this survey, on average about 80% of people worldwide identified as heterosexual, 3% as gay, lesbian or homosexual, 4% as bisexual, 1% as pansexual or omnisexual, 1% as asexual, 1% as &quot;other&quot;, and 11% don&#x27;t know or won&#x27;t say. Results indicated that significant differences in sexual identity have emerged between generations across the globe, with the youngest group, or Generation Z, being more likely to identify as bisexual (9%) than Millennials (4%), Generation X (3%) and Boomers (2%). Generation Z and Millennials were also more likely to identify as homosexual, with 4% and 3% doing so respectively, compared to 2% of Generation X and 1% of Boomers. In addition, the survey found that men are more likely than women to identify as homosexual (4% vs. 1%).

=== Australia ===

==== 2001–2002 ====
The then largest and most thorough survey in Australia was conducted by telephone interview with 19,307 respondents between the ages of 16 and 59 in 2001/2002. The study found that 97.4% of men identified as heterosexual, 1.6% as homosexual and 0.9% as bisexual. For women 97.7% identified as heterosexual, 0.8% as lesbian and 1.4% as bisexual. Nevertheless, 8.6% of men and 15.1% of women reported either feelings of attraction to the same gender or some sexual experience with the same gender. Overall, 8.6% of women and 5.9% of men reported some homosexual experience in their lives; these figures fell to 5.7% and 5.0% respectively when non-genital sexual experience was excluded. Half the men and two thirds of the women who had same-sex sexual experience regarded themselves as heterosexual rather than homosexual.

==== 2012–2013 ====
An update on the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 respondents), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% of the men and 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly more likely than men to identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.

==== 2014 ====
In interviews with 180,000 Australians aged 14+, Roy Morgan Research reported in 2014 that 4.1% of men and 2.8% of women identified as homosexual. Men outnumbered women among homosexuals in all age groups. For both sexes, the share identifying as homosexual was highest in the 20–29 age group.

The 2014 General Social Survey, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, estimated that over half a million people, or 3% of the adult population, identified as gay, lesbian, or &#x27;other&#x27;.

==== 2020 ====
A study conducted by BioMed Central estimated that 3.6% of males and 3.4% of females were gay, lesbian, bisexual, or another sexual minority.

=== Austria ===
A 2018 study reported that the percentage of people identifying as LGB in Austria was 6.2% (broken into 5.5% for males and 6.8% for females).

===Brazil===

==== 1998 ====
In a sample of 2,054 Brazilians aged 18 to 60 years of age, the Datafolha pollster found that 14% (or 15% of men and 13% of women) feel at least some same-sex attraction, while 70% did not feel any such attraction; the remaining 16% did not answer the question. Seventy-four percent of Brazilians said they never had a homosexual experience, 16% refused to answer the question, and 9% said they had some homosexual experience. The percentage with homosexual experience was higher among men (14%) than among women (5%), and higher also among those with more formal education (15%), singles (12%), and Northeasterners (11%). The non-religious (18%) and Pentecostal Protestants (11%) were more likely to have had homosexual experiences than Catholics (8%).

==== 2013 ====
In an Ibope survey with a sample of 2,363 Brazilian Internet users weighted for national representativity, 83% declared themselves heterosexual, 7% homosexual, 5% bisexual, 1% other, and 4% refused to disclose their orientation. Twice as many male internet users as females identified as gay or bisexual (16% vs. 8%). People aged 18–29 were the most likely to identify as non-heterosexual (15%), followed by those aged 30–49 (10%). Only 5% of the population aged 50 or more consider themselves gay or bisexual. Among non-heterosexuals, 42% said they had no religion, compared to 13% of the heterosexual population. The Class B (middle class) had the highest percentage of non-heterosexuals (14%), followed by Class A (upper class, 11%). Classes C and D (lower–middle and low classes) had 10% gays and bisexuals. Among the Brazilian regions, Northern Brazil had the lowest percentage of non-heterosexuals (2%). All other regions had percentages at or above 10%, with the Center-West reporting the highest (14%).

=== Canada ===

==== 2003–2014: Canadian Community Health Survey ====
==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 8% of Canadian women identify as gay or bisexual.

==== 2018 ====
In 2018, around 4% of the Canadian population identified as LGBT, according to Statistics Canada.

=== Czech Republic ===
In 2015, around 7% of men and 10% of women identified as gay, according to a survey of around 30,000 people by the Faculty of Science at Charles University in Prague. However, it was a survey of sexual behaviour of Czechs and took about 90 minutes to complete, so only highly motivated people completed the survey. Research on sexual behaviour continued in 2016, with some surveys of the research receiving up to 40,000 responses. According to the research, the number of non-heterosexual men in the Czech Republic is 6.7%, and 11.5% of women. The researchers said the numbers did not seem right to them, and they verified them multiple times in other surveys with other people, but they believe the data are credible.

=== Denmark ===
A random survey found that 2.7% of the 1,373 men who responded to their questionnaire had homosexual experience (intercourse).

=== France ===

==== 1992 ====
A study of 20,055 people found that 4.1% of the men and 2.6% of the women had at least one occurrence of sexual relations with person of the same sex during their lifetime.

==== 2011 ====
In a nationally representative online survey of 7,841 French adults carried out by IFOP in early 2011, 6.6% of respondents identified as homosexual (3.6%) or bisexual (3%), and 90.8% as heterosexual. Compared to the heterosexual population, the homosexual population was much more likely to be male, single, and younger than 65, as well as to be living alone. Homosexuals were more likely to be economically active and work in &quot;superior intellectual professions&quot; but on average had a smaller household income. They were also more likely to be residing in big cities, especially in the region of Paris. The bisexual population had fewer statistically significant deviations from the heterosexual population, resembling the heterosexuals on some measures, homosexuals on others, or being at a midpoint on still some others. However, they were more likely to be aged 18–24 than the other two groups. Like homosexuals, they were also more likely to be single.

In another IFOP survey of 9,515 French adults conducted later that same year, 6.5% of the sample identified as homosexual (3%) or bisexual (3.5%). Among LGBs, men outnumbered women by more than 2 to 1.

==== 2014 ====
Based in a survey with about 10,000 respondents, IFOP estimated that 90% of French people are heterosexual, 3% identify as bisexual, and 4% consider themselves homosexual. Two percent say they have not embraced a definition for their sexuality, and 1% did not wish to respond. More women than men are heterosexual (93% &quot;versus&quot; 86%), whereas more men than women identify as homosexual (7% v. 1%) and to a lesser extent bisexual (4% v. 2%). A homosexual or bisexual identity was more common in people aged 18–49 (9%) than among those aged 50–64 (6%) or over 65 (4%). More singles than people in relationships identified as homo- or bisexual (11% v. 6%). An LGB identity is also more common among people who said they have had more than 10 sex partners or none at all compared to those who have had intermediary levels of sexual experience. Catholics are more likely to identify as heterosexual (91%) than people who said they had some other religion or no religion whatsoever (88% each).

==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 4% of French women identify as gay or bisexual. In the category of women aged less than 25, 9% identify as bisexual and 5% as lesbian.

In another IFOP survey of Paris residents, 79% of men and 70% of women identified as heterosexual, 13% of men and 15% of women as homosexual, and 7% of men and 18% of women as bisexual.

=== Germany ===

==== 2015 ====
According to Yougov, the following is how German adults are distributed along the Kinsey scale (by age):
==== 2016 ====
In a nationally representative, face-to-face survey with over 2,500 Germans (55% female), it was found that 86% of men and 82% of women identify as exclusively heterosexual, 3% of men and 4% of women are mostly heterosexual, 1% of each sex declared themselves bisexual, and 1.5% as predominantly or exclusively homosexual. Other sexual orientations were reported by 3% of men and 4% of women. One percent of each sex was uncertain. Four percent of men and 7% of women gave no answer.

==== 2017 ====
A female-only survey found that 5% of German women identify as lesbian or bisexual.

=== Iceland ===
An estimation from 2005 gave around 6.9% as the proportion of the population that is homosexual in Iceland.

=== Iran ===
In Iran, due to official and unofficial restrictions, clear and accurate information about the number of homosexuals has not been recorded. On the other hand, the Iranian government has always denied the identity of homosexuals. Iranian Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, during his 2007 speech at Columbia University, asserted that there were no gay people in Iran. In 2018, a research called &quot;Forbidden tale&quot; &quot;A comprehensive study on lesbian, gay, bisexuals (LGB) in Iran&quot; showed that in Iranian laws, for the reason of facing punishment such as flogging and imprisonment, male homosexuals refuse to publicly announce their sexual identity. On the other hand, social pressures and the fear of being rejected or judged have caused homosexuals to start a semi-secret life in Iran.

=== Ireland ===

==== 2006 ====
A study of the responses of 7,441 individuals, conducted by the ESRI, found that 2.7% of men and 1.2% of women self-identified as homosexual or bisexual. A question based on a variant of the Kinsey scale found that 5.3% of men and 5.8% of women reported some same-sex attraction. Of those surveyed, 7.1% of men and 4.7% of women reported a homosexual experience some time in their life so far. It also found that 4.4% of men and 1.4% of women reported a &quot;genital same-sex experience&quot; (oral or anal sex, or any other genital contact) in their life so far. The study was commissioned and published by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency in partnership with the Department of Health and Children.

=== Israel ===

==== 2012 ====
In a sample representative of the Israeli Jewish population aged 18 to 44, it was found that 11.3% of men and 15.2% of women self-reported attraction to the same-gender, 10.2% and 8.7% reported lifetime same-gender encounters, while 8.2% and 4.8% self-identified as gay or bisexual men and lesbian or bisexual women, respectively. A non-heterosexual identity was more common in Tel Aviv than in other parts of the country and, among men, it was also correlated with younger age.

==== 2015 ====
In a survey employing the Kinsey scale, 4.5% of non-religious Israelis placed themselves on points 5 or 6 on the scale, indicating a homosexual orientation with minor or non-existent opposite-sex attraction, and 91.5% placed themselves on points 0 or 1, which indicates a heterosexual orientation with minor or non-existent same-sex attraction. In the category of young adults, aged 18 to 24, 7.4% placed themselves on Kinsey points 5 or 6, and 80% on points 0 or 1. Compared to the larger population, more young adults also placed themselves on point 3 of the Kinsey scale, meaning that equal attraction to both sexes (4.2% &quot;versus&quot; 1%), and on point 2, meaning a mostly heterosexual orientation with major homosexual attraction (7.4% v. 2.3%). Point 4 of the Kinsey scale, indicating a mostly homosexual orientation with major heterosexual attraction, contained a similar share of young adults and all adults (1.1% v. 0.7%).

=== Italy ===

==== 2011 ====
A random survey of 7,725 Italians (18–74 years old) conducted by the National Institute of Statistics between June and December 2011 with CAPI technique found that about 2.4% of the population declared to be homosexual or bisexual, 77% heterosexual, 0.1% transsexual, 4% reported to be &quot;other&quot;, 15.6% did not answer. An extended survey including all the people that during their lives fell or are in love with a same-sex individual, or that had sexual intercourse with a same-sex individual, increases the percentage to 6.7% of the population. More men than women, more northerners than southerners, more younger than older people identified themselves as homosexuals. Members of 7725 families spread over 660 Italian municipalities took part in the survey.

==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 1% of Italian women identify as gay or bisexual.

===Japan===

==== 2012 ====
A survey by the Dentsu group estimated that 5.2% of Japanese are LGBT.

==== 2015 ====
Dentsu&#x27;s new estimate for the LGBT population of Japan was 7.6% for people aged 20 to 59.

==== 2018 ====
Dentsu&#x27;s new estimate for the LGBT population of Japan was 8.9% for people aged 20 to 59.

=== Mexico ===

==== 2017 ====
According to a nationally representative study organized by Kantar TNS, 88% of Mexican men aged 18 to 30 years identify as heterosexual, 6% as homosexual, 5% as bisexual, and 1% as other.

=== Netherlands ===

==== 2001 ====
In a face-to-face survey carried out by the Dutch National Survey of General Practice, of the 4,229 men with a valid answer to the sexual orientation question, 1.5% self-identified as gay, 0.6% as bisexual and 97.9% as heterosexual. Of the 5,282 women, 1.5% self-identified as lesbian, 1.2% as bisexual, and 97.3% as heterosexual.

==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 8% of Dutch women identify as gay or bisexual.

==== 2023 ====
A 2024 study by Statistics Netherlands analyzed the data from the &quot;Veiligheidsmonitor 2023&quot;, a periodic population-based study of safety, livability and victimization of common crime. It estimates that about 18% (2.7 million people) of the Dutch population are LGBTQIA. It further estimates that 17% (2.5 million) of Dutch people have a non-heterosexual orientation, 1% (151 thousand) is transgender/nonbinary/genderqueer and 0.3% (45 thousand) are intersex people. 11% are reported to be &quot;bi-plus&quot; (or bisexual), 2% homosexual men, 1% asexual women, 1% homosexual women and 1% asexual men. Furthermore, 1% of people stated that they don&#x27;t know who they are attracted to (yet).

=== New Zealand ===

==== 2007 ====
In an anonymous survey of 8,000 New Zealand secondary school students conducted by the University of Auckland, 0.9% of those surveyed reported exclusive attraction to the same sex, 3.3% to both sexes and 1.8% to neither.

==== 1993–2011 ====
The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study is a prospective study that looked at changes in sexual behavior, attraction, and identity among around 1,000 New Zealanders born in 1972 or 1973. Samples were first interviewed in 1993, when they were 21, and again at ages 26, 32, and 38, in 2010/2011. The study found a strong decrease in the share of women who self-reported exclusive heterosexual attraction from age 21 (88.3%) to age 26 (82.5%), but a small increase at age 32 (84.2%) and again at 38 (87.6%). By contrast, among men, the share self-reporting exclusive heterosexual attraction remained largely stable between ages 21 (94.9%) and 32 (94.2%), with a small decrease at age 38 (92.9%). Sexual identity was only assessed at ages 32 and 38. At age 32, 0.9% of women and 1.3% of men self-identified as gay, and 2.9% of women and 1.7% of men as bisexual. Additionally, 1.5% of women and 2.2% of men identified as &quot;other&quot;. At age 38, 1.1% of women and 1.7% of men self-identified as gay, and 2.6% of women and 3% of men as bisexual, with 1.1% of women and 0.2% of men identifying as &quot;other&quot;. While sexual attraction changed more for women than for men, changes among men were more consistently to greater homosexuality, while changes among women past age 26 occurred equally in both directions (i.e., to both more and less heterosexual attraction). Researchers discussed several factors behind the changes, from age effects to cultural effects, with homosexuality, especially female homosexuality, becoming more socially acceptable in the West in the 1990s and 2000s.

==== 2013–2014 ====
According to results from the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.3% of New Zealanders identify as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender differences were found in the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were more likely than men to identify as bisexual (2.1% &quot;versus&quot; 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.

=== Norway ===

==== 1988 ====
In a random survey of 6,300 Norwegians, 3.5% of the men and 3% of the women reported that they had a homosexual experience sometime in their life.

==== 2003 ====
In an anonymous survey of 1,971 male high school students performed in 2003, 1% self-reported having had a boyfriend and 2% having fallen in love with a man.

=== Philippines ===

The Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Survey conducted in 2013 by the University of the Philippines found that 96.2% of youth describe themselves as straight/heterosexual. 2.1% described themselves as gay or lesbian while 1.7% are bisexual. 2.4% of men described themselves as gay, while 1.8% of women described themselves as lesbian.

=== Poland ===
A volunteer-based research of adult Poles showed that different modes of survey produce significant differences in the share of people who admit homosexual attraction. In paper-based surveys, 6% of respondents self-reported same-sex attraction, compared to 12% of online respondents. There were no other significant differences in other aspects of sexual life, and the two sets of volunteers were similar in age, education, and geographical location.

Another study showed that 4.9% of Poles identified as LGBT (5.5% for males and 4.3% for females).

=== Pakistan ===
In a 2013 questionnaire study of 2400 Pakistani males, 62 were exclusively homosexual (2.6%) and 146 were bisexual (6%).

=== Portugal ===

==== 2005 ====
A national survey from 2005 by Eurosondagem for the weekly national newspaper Expresso, estimated that about 9.9% (1 million) of the Portuguese people are homosexual or bisexual. This study used anonymous and confidential surveys. For people more than 15 years old, 7% stated that they are homosexual, 2.9% that they are bisexual and 90.1% are heterosexual. Among those who indicate that they are homosexual or bisexual, there was no major difference between men (7.3% and 2.8%) and women (6.8% and 3%) respectively. Only about 50% of LGB people in Portugal are socially open about their sexual orientation.

==== 2012 ====
Another survey from 2012 for the same weekly newspaper, with 1,220 respondents more than 18 years old, used a 100 question survey about sexuality. They found that 77.5% are exclusively heterosexual, 2.1% are predominantly heterosexual, 0.6% are bisexual, 0.4% are predominantly homosexual and 1.6% are exclusively homosexual. 17.8% preferred not to answer about their sexual orientation. Of those who identified as heterosexual, 5.7% claimed to have already kissed, 1.3% claimed to feel attraction, and 1% claimed to have already had sex with someone of the same sex.

=== South Africa ===

In a 2016 report titled: &#x27;Progressive Prudes: A Survey of Attitudes towards Homosexuality and Gender Non-Conformity in South Africa&#x27; produced by the Other Foundation and the Human Sciences Research Council, found that 530,000 men and women of all population groups, both rural and urban dwelling, and across age groups, self-identify as either homosexual, bisexual, or gender non-conforming.

=== South Korea ===
In 2019, an OECD report noted that &quot;Korea does not have any nationally representative survey that includes a survey question on self-identification as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, nor does it collect information on the share of transgender people among the adult population.&quot;

=== Spain ===

==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 6% of Spanish women identify as gay or bisexual.

==== 2017: Barómetro Control ====
The sixth edition of the Barómetro Control sexual behavior survey, which was performed in 2017, and is representative of the Spanish population aged 18 to 35, found that 89% of young Spanish adults identify as heterosexual, 6% as male homosexual, 3% as female homosexual, and 2% as bisexual.

=== Sri Lanka ===

==== 2021 ====
A flagship survey conducted by EQUAL GROUND, a leading queer rights organization in Sri Lanka identified that approximately 12% of Sri Lanka&#x27;s adult population identifies as LGBTQ+, with 8% identifying as bisexual, 0.5% as gay, 0.5% as lesbian, 1% as transgender, and 2% as &quot;other&quot;.

=== Sweden ===
In an anonymous survey of 1,978 male high school students performed in 2003, respondents answered a question regarding same-sex attraction by choosing a number in a 5-point Likert scale (1 = no and 5 = strong). Those who marked the number 5 made up 4% of the sample and those who marked the numbers 3 or 4, presented by researchers as self-reporting &quot;some&quot; same-sex attraction, 7 percent.

=== Thailand ===
According to 2018 estimates from LGBT Capital, there were about 4.2 million LGBT people in Thailand.
=== United Kingdom ===
==== 1992 ====
A study of 8,337 British men found that 6.1% have had a &quot;homosexual experience&quot; and 3.6% had &quot;1+ homosexual partner ever.&quot;

==== 2005 ====
HM Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry completed a survey to help the government analyse the financial implications of the Civil Partnerships Act (such as pensions, inheritance and tax benefits). They concluded that there were 3.6 million gay people in Britain—around 6% of the total population or 1 in 16.66 people.

==== 2008 ====
In a survey of around 1,000 Britons using a self-completed questionnaire, 2% of the total sample identified as bisexual, 4% as homosexual, and 92% as heterosexual.

==== 2009 ====
In an online survey with over 75,000 YouGov panelists in Britain, 90.9% identified as heterosexual, 5.8% as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 1.3% opted not to give an answer, and 2.1% gave other reasons. The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Among men, around 89% identified as heterosexual, 5.5% identified as gay, and 2.5% as bisexual. Straight women constituted around 93% of all women, lesbians were 1.4%, and bisexual women 2.3 percent. A little over two percent of each sex identified as &quot;Other&quot;, and a little over 1% did not want to indicate a sexual orientation. Non-heterosexuals tended to be younger, and this was especially the case for bisexual women and gay men, whose average ages were 32 and 36 respectively, compared to an average of 47 among heterosexuals. Ethnic minorities were less likely to identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not to disclose their sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). Sexual minorities tended to concentrate more in certain parts of the country—in London especially, where 27% of gay men and lesbians, as well as 19% of bisexuals, took residence, compared to only 14% of heterosexuals. Employment status also correlated with sexual orientation, as more gay than straight men worked full-time (three-quarters v. 57%), and the same was true among women (lesbians: 58%, straight women: 41%). Similarly, gay men (73%) and lesbians (66%) were overrepresented among the upper classes (classes ABC1), though the difference between heterosexuals and bisexuals (54% v. 58%) was not statistically significant. LGB people—especially lesbians—also had on average higher educational achievement.

The study argued for the need to provide strong anonymity to respondents in order to gauge the true size of the non-heterosexual population, as more LGB than heterosexual respondents indicated they would be less likely to disclose their true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.

==== 2014 ====
In an anonymous online sex survey carried out by &quot;The Observer&quot; on the sex lives of the British, 4% of the 1,052 samples surveyed identified as gay or lesbian, and another 4% as bisexual.

In a nationally representative Survation study of 1,003 British women, 92% identified as heterosexual, 1.6% as gay or lesbian, 3.5% as bisexual, 0.3% as other, and 2.6% refused to disclose their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation appeared to be linked with age. Millennial women, aged 18–34, were significantly more likely to identify as bisexual (6.6%) than women aged 35–54 (1.4%) or older women (0.7%). Age differences were smaller for lesbian identity, but the pattern was the same, with 1.9% younger women identifying as lesbian, compared with 1.6% of middle aged and 1.3% of older women. Heterosexual identity followed the opposite pattern, being highest among older women (95.3%) and lowest among Millennials (89.1%). Sexual identity was also strongly correlated with childlessness, with 9.6% of childless women identifying as gay or bisexual, compared with 3.6% of women with underage children, and 0.5% of women with adult children.

==== 2015 ====
In a YouGov survey of 1,632 adults, 5.5% identified as gay, 2.1% as bisexual, and 88.7% as heterosexual. Asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, 72% of all adults, and 46% of adults aged 18–24 years, picked a score of zero, meaning that they identify as totally heterosexual. Four percent of the total sample, and 6% of young adults, picked a score of six, meaning a totally homosexual identity. Sex researcher Simon LeVay criticized this survey as unreliable because the respondents were not randomly sampled from the entire population.

==== 2009–2016: Integrated Household Survey ====
In all years, it was observed that an LGB identity is most common among London residents and those aged under 35. Homosexual identity in 2016 was more than twice as common among men (1.7%) than among women (0.7%), whereas bisexual identity was more common among women (0.9%) than men (0.6%).

==== 2016 ====
A female-only survey found that 4% of British women identify as gay or bisexual.

The United Kingdom Office for National Statistics Annual Population Survey reported over 1 million (2.0%) of the UK population aged 16 and over identified as Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual (LGB). This represented a statistically significant increase from 1.7% in 2015.

==== 2017 ====
In a Survation poll on adults aged 40–70, 92.5% identified as heterosexual, 3.5% as gay, 2.4% as bisexual, 0.5% as Other and 1% did not want to reveal their sexual orientation. Those under 60 were less likely to identify as heterosexual than those aged 60–70. A gay identity was more common among men (6.1%) than women (1%), and the opposite was true of heterosexuality (men: 89.9%, women: 95%). No differences were found in the share identifying as bisexual (2.4% &quot;versus&quot; 2.5%). London had a higher share of middle aged or older people identifying as gay (8%) or bisexual (6%) than other parts of the country.

According to a nationally representative study organized by Kantar TNS, 87% of British men aged 18 to 30 years identify as heterosexual, 7% as homosexual, 5% as bisexual, and 2% as other.

An Ipsos MORI survey on behalf of BBC found that British people aged 16–22 (also called Generation Z) have lower odds to identify as exclusively straight (66%) than those who belong to the Millennial generation (71%), Generation X (85%), or Baby boomers (88%). Within Generation Z, there were several important gender differences in sexual identity: young men were more likely to identify as completely heterosexual than young women (73% v. 59%) whereas young women had higher chances to identify as non-exclusively straight (19%) and bisexual (14%) than young men (10% and 5%, respectively). There were no significant gender differences in the share identifying as predominantly or exclusively homosexual (5% for each sex), but Generation Z men were significantly more likely to refuse to disclose their sexual orientation (7%) than their female counterparts (3%). Significantly more white youth identified as exclusively homosexual (3%) than those of ethnic minority backgrounds (0%) but no other ethnic differences were found. Exclusively heterosexual youths were also less likely to describe themselves as fairly or very active in politics, but they were more likely to believe that they enjoy a better life than Millennials.

Among older adults, there were no differences in the share of men (82%) and women (80%) identifying as exclusively heterosexual. But more women than men identified as mostly heterosexual (11% v. 6%), while more men than women identified as exclusively homosexual (4% v. 2%) and mostly homosexual (2% v. 0.4%). Exclusive heterosexuals were more likely to have voted &quot;Leave&quot; on the 2016 UK referendum to leave the European Union, whereas mostly heterosexuals and exclusive homosexuals were overrepresented among &quot;Remain&quot; voters.

==== 2019 ====
The Annual Population Survey reported that an estimated 2.7% of the population aged 16 or over identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.

==== 2021 ====
For the first time, the 2021 United Kingdom census included a question on sexual orientation. Results for Scotland are expected to be published from spring 2024 onwards.
=== United States ===

The demographics of sexual orientation and gender identity in the United States have been studied in the social sciences in recent decades. A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1% of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men. A different survey in 2016, from the Williams Institute, estimated that 0.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender. According to an estimate based on UNAIDS 2018 data, there is a least 4.5 million gay or bisexual men in the United States.

Data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz reported that the actual prevalence of gay men does not appear to vary between states in the U.S. because the percentage of Internet porn searches that are for gay male porn are nearly the same in all states, about 5 percent. Stephens-Davidowitz argues that in states where there is a social stigma against homosexuality that &quot;many more gay men are in the closet than are out&quot;. Less than ten years following the &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013) and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015) U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Gallup found that nationwide public support for same-sex marriage had increased to 70% in 2021 while same-sex married couples accounted for 0.5% of all U.S. households and unmarried same-sex couples accounted for 0.4% of all U.S. households in the 2020 United States census.

==== 2011 ====
The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, a sexual orientation law think tank, released a study in April 2011 estimating based on its research that 1.7 percent of American adults identify as gay or lesbian, while another 1.8 percent identify as bisexual. Drawing on information from four national and two state-level population-based surveys, the analyses suggest that there are more than 8 million adults in the US who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual, comprising 3.5% of the adult population. Of men, 2.2% identify as gay and an additional 1.4% as bisexual. Of women, 1.1% identify as lesbian and an additional 2.2% as bisexual.

These charts show lists of the cities and the metropolitan areas with the highest LGB population in terms of numbers of total gay, lesbian and bisexual residents, based on estimates published in 2006 by the Williams Institute of the UCLA School of Law.

== Research issues ==
=== Incidence versus prevalence ===

A significant distinction can be made between what medical statisticians call incidence and prevalence. For example, even if two studies agree on a common criterion for defining a sexual orientation, one study might regard this as applying to any person who has ever met this criterion, whereas another might only regard that person as being so if they had done so during the year of the survey. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation refers to an &quot;enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes&quot;, as well as to &quot;a person&#x27;s sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.&quot; Therefore, a person can be celibate and still identify as being bisexual or homosexual based on romantic proclivities.

===Effect of survey mode===
According to many a source, from academic researchers to pollsters to market research groups, the population that identifies as LGBT and/or has had sexual relations with the same sex may be underestimated in surveys that employ live interviewers to collect data. Their argument is that methods stronger in anonymity and/or confidentiality, such as online questionnaires and IVR interviews, are better than more traditional survey modes at gauging the size of the non-heterosexual population.

British researchers with the third wave of the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) addressed this matter in one of their studies. Interviewers collected data on sexual behavior from a sample of over 15,000 subjects at their home. However, a portion of respondents agreed to complete an online questionnaire asking many of the same questions asked live before. The questionnaire was to be taken one to two months after the original interview. The data below were extracted from the &quot;same group&quot; of 202 men and 325 women who gave out information about same-sex experiences live and then successfully completed the online questionnaire later. Numbers show how answers varied between survey modes and the information is given on whether the difference between methods was significant or not.

Researchers from other countries have produced similar findings. In Poland, for example, it was found in an experiment that self-reporting same-sex attraction was twice as common using an online questionnaire as in a paper questionnaire, despite the fact that the group that answered the online questions and the one that filled out the paper form were similar on all demographic variables and on all other aspects of their sexuality. In the 90s, an experiment was made in the US where it was found that teen males were several times more likely to acknowledge same-sex experiences using a computer methodology compared to paper questionnaires.

=== Change in prevalence over time ===
In addition, shifts can occur in reports of the prevalence of homosexuality. For example, the Hamburg Institute for Sexual Research conducted a survey over the sexual behavior of young people in 1970 and repeated it in 1990. Whereas in 1970 18% of the boys ages 16 and 17 reported to have had at least one same-sex sexual experience, the number had dropped to 2% by 1990.

Data from the General Social Survey shows that the percentage of Americans reporting predominantly same-sex partners remained stable between 1989 and 2014. In contrast, the percentage who reported &quot;ever&quot; having a same-sex partner increased. By contrast, the National Survey of Family Growth has found an increase in the share of men and women who self-report a bisexual orientation in their 2011–2013 study compared to previous surveys. Likewise, in the Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, whose data was collected in 2012 and 2013, researchers noticed significant growth in the share of women who report bisexual orientation and attraction, and the share of men who report exclusive homosexual attraction, compared to the results of the First Australian Study of Health and Relationships, executed in 2001.

=== Cultural perceptions ===

The population that has come to be referred to as &quot;gay&quot; in the West is not a descriptive term that would be recognized by all men who have sex with men (MSM) as known in the rest of the world. While gay culture is increasingly open and discussed, the world of MSM consists of a diverse population that often may respond differently depending on how communications in clinical settings are framed. &quot;Gay&quot; is generally used to describe a homosexual sexual orientation, while &quot;MSM&quot; describes sexual behavior between men.

Some men who have sex with other men will not relate to the term &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;homosexual&quot;, and do not regard sexual activity with other men as actual sexual activity. Instead, they view sexual relations with women as valid. This is particularly true among individuals from non-Western cultures, but it is also common in the US. Terms such as &quot;MSM&quot; or &quot;same gender loving&quot; are often used in place of the word &quot;gay&quot;. Men in Africa and Latin America engage in sexual relationships with other men while still referring to themselves as &quot;heterosexual&quot;, which is known as being on the &quot;down-low&quot;.

There is a relative lack of information on sexual behavior in most developing countries. The limited sources that are available indicate that although homosexual self-identification might occur relatively infrequently, the prevalence of homosexual behavior is higher. These men are not taken into consideration in some sexual identity surveys which may lead to under-reporting and inaccuracies.

=== Importance of having reliable demographics ===

Reliable data on the size of the gay and lesbian population would be valuable for informing public policy. For example, demographics would help calculate the costs and benefits of domestic partnership benefits, or the impact of legalizing gay adoption. Further, knowledge of the size of the &quot;gay and lesbian population holds promise for helping social scientists understand a wide array of important questions—questions about the general nature of labor market choices, accumulation of human capital, specialization within households, discrimination, and decisions about geographic location.&quot; More data are also needed to understand the degree of underrepresentation of sexual minorities in certain fields such as STEM, as well as the academic performance of sexual minorities more broadly.

== Kinsey Reports ==
Two of the most famous studies of the demographics of human sexual orientation were Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; (1948) and &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; (1953). These studies used a seven-point spectrum to define sexual behavior, from 0 for completely heterosexual to 6 for completely homosexual. Kinsey concluded that a small percentage of the population were to one degree or another bisexual (falling on the scale from 1 to 5). He also reported that 37% of men in the U.S. had achieved orgasm through contact with another male after adolescence and 13% of women had achieved orgasm through contact with another woman.

His results, however, have been disputed, especially in 1954 by a team consisting of John Tukey, Frederick Mosteller and William G. Cochran, who stated much of Kinsey&#x27;s work was based on convenience samples rather than random samples, and thus would have been vulnerable to bias.

Paul Gebhard, Kinsey&#x27;s former colleague and successor as director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, reviewed the Kinsey data and removed what he thought were its purported contaminants. He again found that almost exactly 37% of men had engaged in homosexual activity. However, he also pointed out that Kinsey later concluded it was a mistake trying to generalize to the entire population.

More recent researchers believe that Kinsey overestimated the rate of same-sex attraction because of flaws in his sampling methods.

<text>The Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) is a trade association representing the interests of commercial radio and television broadcasters in Canada. It is co-located with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council in Ottawa.

It was first established in 1925, with a goal to lobby for Canadian copyright law to contain provisions for the distribution of royalties for music played by radio stations. Following the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which served as both a broadcaster and regulator, the CAB lobbied for the establishment of an independent regulator of broadcasting in Canada, a goal achieved in 1958 with the formation of the Board of Broadcast Governors. The CAB worked with the BBG to assist in the establishment of private radio and television broadcasters. In the 1970s, the CAB lobbied against attempts by the BBG&#x27;s successor, the CRTC, to implement policies for Canadian content. In 1998, the CAB established the Canadian Radio Music Awards.

In January 2009, amid growing vertical integration and president Glenn O&#x27;Farrell stepping down, the CAB announced that it planned to restructure itself as a &quot;streamlined and effective advocacy association representing private radio and television broadcasters to the federal government&quot;. The CAB agreed to form a smaller board devoted to issues affecting the industry as a whole, such as accessibility, copyright, and administrating media-related funds.

<doc id="1088297" wikidata="Q3243130" url="?curid=1088297" title="List of objects at Lagrange points">
<text>This is a list of known objects which occupy, have occupied, or are planned to occupy any of the five Lagrange points of two-body systems in space.
==Sun–Earth Lagrange points==

=== Sun–Earth L1 ===
 is the Lagrange point located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth towards the Sun.

====Past probes====
*International Cometary Explorer, formerly the International Sun–Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE-3), diverted out of in 1983 for a comet rendezvous mission. Currently in heliocentric orbit. The Sun–Earth L1 is also the point to which the Reboot ISEE-3 mission was attempting to return the craft as the first phase of a recovery mission (as of September 25, 2014 all efforts have failed and contact was lost).
*NASA&#x27;s Genesis probe collected solar wind samples at from December 3, 2001, to April 1, 2004, when it returned the sample capsule to Earth. It returned briefly in late 2004 before being pushed into heliocentric orbit in early 2005.
*LISA Pathfinder (LPF) was launched on 3 December 2015, and arrived at on 22 January 2016, where, among other experiments, it tested the technology needed by (e)LISA to detect gravitational waves. LISA Pathfinder used an instrument consisting of two small gold alloy cubes.
*The Chang&#x27;e 5 orbiter (during extended mission. After ferrying lunar samples back to Earth in 2020, the transport module was sent to where it is permanently stationed to conduct limited Earth-Sun observations.)

====Present probes====

* The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in a halo orbit around L1
** Mission: Investigation of the outer layer of the Sun, making observations of solar wind and associated phenomena in the vicinity of L1, probing the interior structure of the Sun.
** Launched: 2 December 1995
** Arrival: Operational orbit in May 1996
**Institution: ESA
* The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) in a Lissajous orbit
* WIND (At since 2004)

* The Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), designed to image the sunlit Earth in 10 wavelengths (EPIC) and monitor total reflected radiation (NISTAR). Launched on 11 February 2015, began orbiting L1 on 8 June 2015 to study the solar wind and its effects on Earth. DSCOVR is unofficially known as GORESAT, because it carries a camera always oriented to Earth and capturing full-frame photos of the planet similar to the Blue Marble. This concept was proposed by then-Vice President of the United States Al Gore in 1998 and was a centerpiece in his 2006 film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;.
*Aditya-L1 was successfully launched on 2 September 2023 and entered the halo orbit around the lagrange point on 6 January 2024. It&#x27;s a Solar observation mission by ISRO. It will study solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms, and their impact on the environment around the Earth.

====Planned probes====
*Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe slated for launch in late 2025
*NEO Surveyor
*SWFO-L1
*Vigil (ESA). One spacecraft in L1 and one in L5.

=== Sun–Earth L2 ===
 is the Lagrange point located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun. Spacecraft at the Sun–Earth L2 point are in a Lissajous orbit until decommissioned, when they are sent into a heliocentric graveyard orbit.

====Past probes====

*2001 – 2010: NASA&#x27;s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observed the cosmic microwave background. It was moved to a heliocentric orbit to avoid posing a hazard to future missions.
*2003 – 2004: NASA&#x27;s WIND. The spacecraft then went to Earth orbit, before heading to .
*2009 – 2013: The ESA Herschel Space Observatory exhausted its supply of liquid helium and was moved from the Lagrangian point in June 2013.
*2009 – 2013: At the end of its mission ESA&#x27;s &quot;Planck&quot; spacecraft was put into a heliocentric orbit and passivated to prevent it from endangering any future missions.
*2011 – 2012: CNSA&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 2. Chang&#x27;e 2 was then placed onto a heliocentric orbit that took it past the near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis.

====Present probes====

* The ESA Gaia probe
* The joint Russian-German high-energy astrophysics observatory Spektr-RG
* The joint NASA, ESA and CSA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
* The ESA Euclid mission
* The CNSA Chang&#x27;e 6 orbiter

====Planned probes====
*The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (WFIRST)
*The ESA PLATO mission, which will find and characterize rocky exoplanets. 
*The JAXA LiteBIRD mission.
*The ESA Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) 
*The ESA ARIEL mission, which will observe the atmospheres of exoplanets.
*The joint ESA-JAXA Comet Interceptor
*The NASA Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) which would replace the Hubble Space Telescope.

====Cancelled probes====
*The ESA Eddington mission
*The NASA Terrestrial Planet Finder mission (may be placed in an Earth-trailing orbit instead)

=== Sun–Earth L3 ===
 is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located on the side of the Sun opposite Earth, slightly outside the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Direct communication with spacecraft in this position is blocked by the Sun. 
* There are no known objects in this orbital location. 

=== Sun–Earth L4 ===
 is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located close to the Earth&#x27;s orbit 60° ahead of Earth.

* Asteroid is the first discovered tadpole orbit companion to Earth, orbiting ; like Earth, its mean distance to the Sun is about one astronomical unit.
* Asteroid is the second Earth trojan, confirmed in November 2021, oscillating around in a tadpole orbit and expected to remain there for at least 4000 years, until destabilized by Venus.
*STEREO A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Ahead) made its closest pass to in September 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly faster than Earth.
* OSIRIS-REx passed near the L4 point and performed a survey for asteroids between 9 and 20 February 2017.

=== Sun–Earth L5 ===
, or Earth-trailing orbit, is the Sun–Earth Lagrange point located close to the Earth&#x27;s orbit 60° behind Earth. 

*Asteroid , in a horseshoe companion orbit with Earth, is currently proximal to but at a high inclination.
*STEREO B (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Behind) made its closest pass to in October 2009, on its orbit around the Sun, slightly slower than Earth.
*The Spitzer Space Telescope is in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit drifting away c. 0.1 AU per year. In c. 2013–15 it has passed in its orbit.
*&quot;Hayabusa2&quot; passed near during the spring of 2017, and imaged the surrounding area to search for Earth trojans on 18 April 2018.

====Proposed====

* Chang&#x27;e 5-T1 
* Queqiao relay satellite
* EQUULEUS nanosat.

=== Earth–Moon L4 and L5 ===
*Kordylewski clouds
*Future location of TDRS-style communication satellites to support satellite and further regions on the Moon.

====Past probes====
*Hiten was the first spacecraft to demonstrate a low energy trajectory, passing by and to achieve lunar orbit at a very low fuel expense, compared to usual orbital techniques. Hiten did not find any conclusive increase in dust density at Lagrange points.

====Proposed objects====
* Exploration Gateway Platform
* In his 1976 book &quot;The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space&quot; Dr. Gerard O&#x27;Neill proposed the establishment of gigantic &quot;Space Islands&quot; in . The inhabitants of the L5 Society should convert lunar material to huge solar power satellites. Many works of fiction, most notably the &quot;Gundam&quot; series, involve colonies at these locations.

<doc id="1088298" wikidata="Q806383" url="?curid=1088298" title="Bandwagoning">
<text>Bandwagoning in international relations occurs when a state aligns with a stronger, adversarial power and concedes that the stronger adversary-turned-partner disproportionately gains in the spoils they conquer together. Bandwagoning, therefore, is a strategy employed by states that find themselves in a weak position. The logic stipulates that an outgunned, weaker state should align itself with a stronger adversary because the latter can take what it wants by force anyway. Thucydides&#x27; famous dictum that &quot;the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must&quot; captures the essence of bandwagoning.

Bandwagoning occurs when weaker states decide that the cost of opposing a stronger power exceeds the benefits. The stronger power may offer incentives, such as the possibility of territorial gain, trade agreements, or protection, to induce weaker states to join with it.

Realism predicts that states will bandwagon only when there is no possibility of building a balancing coalition or their geography makes balancing difficult (i.e. surrounded by enemies). Bandwagoning is considered to be dangerous because it allows a rival state to gain power.

Bandwagoning is opposed to balancing, which calls for a state to prevent an aggressor from upsetting the balance of power.

== Etymology ==
Bandwagoning was coined by Quincy Wright in &quot;A Study of War&quot; (1942) and popularized by Kenneth Waltz in &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; (1979); in his work, Waltz incorrectly attributes Stephen Van Evera with having coined the term. Both Wright and Waltz employ the concept to serve as the opposite of balancing behaviour.

==Foreign policy commitments==
The belief that states will ally with a dominant power, as opposed to balance against it, has been a common feature among foreign policy practitioners. German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz&#x27;s &quot;risk theory&quot;, for example, posited that if Germany built a formidable naval fleet, it could force the United Kingdom into neutrality or alliance with it by threatening to the latter&#x27;s maritime supremacy.

According to Stephen Walt, &quot;American officials have repeatedly embraced the bandwagoning hypothesis in justifying American foreign policy commitments.&quot; John F. Kennedy, for example, stated that &quot;if the United States were to falter, the whole world... would inevitably begin to move toward the Communist bloc&quot;. Henry Kissinger suggested that states tend to bandwagon &quot;if leaders around the world... assume that the U.S. lacked either the forces or the will... they will accommodate themselves to the dominant trend&quot;.

Ronald Reagan endorsed the same sentiment when he said, &quot;If we cannot defend ourselves [in Central America], we cannot expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would collapse, our alliances would crumble and the safety of our homeland would be put at jeopardy.&quot;

<text>Ana Pauker (born Hannah Rabinsohn; 13 February 1893 – 3 June 1960) was a Romanian communist leader and served as the country&#x27;s foreign minister in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Ana Pauker became the world&#x27;s first female foreign minister when entering office in December 1947. She was also the unofficial leader of the Romanian Communist Party immediately after World War II.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and political career ===
Pauker was born on 13 February 1893 into a poor, religious Orthodox Jewish family in Codăești, Vaslui County (in central Moldavia), the daughter of Sarah and (Tsvi-)Hersh Kaufman Rabinsohn. Her father was a traditional slaughterer and synagogue functionary, her mother a small-time food seller. They had four surviving children; two more died in infancy. 

As a young woman, Pauker became a teacher in a Jewish elementary school in Bucharest. While her younger brother was a Zionist and remained religious, she opted for Socialism, joining the Social Democratic Party of Romania in 1915 and then its successor, the Socialist Party of Romania, in 1918. She was active in the pro-Bolshevik faction of the group, the one that took control after the Party&#x27;s Congress of 8–12 May 1921 and joined the Comintern under the name of Socialist-Communist Party (future Communist Party of Romania). She and her husband, Marcel Pauker, became leading members. 

Pauker and her husband were arrested in 1923 and 1924 for their political activities and went into exile in Berlin, Paris, and Vienna in 1926 and 1927. In 1928, Pauker moved to Moscow to join the Comintern&#x27;s International Lenin School, which trained senior Communist functionaries. In Moscow she became closely associated with Dmitry Manuilsky, the Kremlin&#x27;s foremost representative at the Comintern in the 1930s.

=== Communist leadership position ===
Ana Pauker went to France, where she became an instructor for the Comintern being also involved in the communist movement elsewhere in the Balkans. Upon returning to Romania in 1935, she was arrested and shot in both legs when she tried to flee. Ana Pauker was the chief defendant in a widely publicized trial with other leading communists and was sentenced to ten years in prison. In May 1941, the Romanian government sent her into exile to the Soviet Union in exchange for Ion Codreanu, a former member of Sfatul Țării (the parliament of Bessarabia that voted for union with Romania on 27 March 1918), who was detained by the Soviets after their occupation of Bessarabia in 1940. In the meantime, her husband had fallen victim to the Soviet Great Purge in 1938. Rumors abounded that she herself had denounced him as a Trotskyist traitor; Comintern archival documents reveal, however, that she repeatedly refused to do so.
In Moscow, she became the leader of the Romanian communist exiles who later on became known as the &quot;Muscovite faction&quot;&quot;.&quot; She returned to Romania in 1944 when the Red Army entered the country, becoming a member of the post-war government, which came to be dominated by the communists. In November 1947, the non-communist foreign minister Gheorghe Tătărescu was ousted and replaced by Pauker, making her the first woman in the modern world to hold such a post.

But it was her position in the Communist Party leadership that was paramount. Although she declined to become the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party because she was a woman, and an intellectual, and had proposed the Romanian worker Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej for the job instead, Pauker formally held the number-two position in the Party leadership and was a member of the four-person Secretariat of the Central Committee. &quot;Arguably the Jewish woman who achieved the most political power in the 20th century,&quot; Ana Pauker was widely believed to have been the actual leader of the Romanian communists in all but name during the immediate post-war period. In 1948 &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured her portrait on its cover and described her as &quot;the most powerful woman alive&quot; at that time. Infamous as the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; of Romanian Communist politics, she was universally seen as unreservedly Stalinist and as Moscow&#x27;s primary agent in Romania.

Unquestionably, Ana Pauker played a pivotal role in the imposition of communism on Romania. At the same time, however, she emerged as a force for moderation within the Romanian communist leadership during the early postwar period. Pauker was certainly complicit in the extensive purges and arrests in 1945 of tens of thousands of Romanians who were linked to the fascist Ion Antonescu regime. Yet, by August 1945 Pauker and interior minister Teohari Georgescu released all but two to three thousand of those arrested, offering amnesty to any member of the fascist Iron Guard who had not committed serious crimes and who would turn in his weapons. In late 1944 or early 1945, she pushed for creating a more broad-based coalition with the National Peasants&#x27; Party and the National Liberal Party, but was overruled by Joseph Stalin; hence, the Communist-led government created in March 1945 comprised a more restrictive coalition with a faction of the National Liberals led by Gheorghe Tătărescu.

During this same period, Pauker also pursued what she later described as &quot;a type of Social Democratic policy&quot; of mass recruitment of as many as 500,000 new Communist Party members without strict verification, including many former members of the Iron Guard. This policy would later be the subject of an attack on Pauker during her purge, and it was quickly overturned. Many of those who entered the party during Pauker&#x27;s mass recruitment campaign would be purged between 1948 and 1950, and mass arrests would return with a vengeance in 1947 (including members of the National Peasants&#x27; Party and the National Liberal Party, as well as the amnestied members of the Iron Guard). Although she acceded to Soviet orders to arrest the leaders of the non-communist opposition, Pauker reportedly opposed the arrests of prominent National Peasants&#x27; Party officials Corneliu Coposu and Ghiță Pop and appealed to the presiding judge of the trial of National Peasants&#x27; Party leader Iuliu Maniu for leniency in his sentencing.
Reviewing her record during the early postwar years, the historian Norman Naimark observed that Pauker&#x27;s &quot;policies in the period 1945–1948 are remarkably similar to those of the Polish leader Władysław Gomułka. She encouraged coalitions with the &#x27;historical&#x27; parties, urged compromises with &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; politicians, and sought to deflect the persecution of social democrats and liberals.&quot;

These contradictions would intensify as the regime became more Stalinist under Cold War pressures from 1947 on. Ana Pauker was a steeled and tested Stalinist who was &quot;fanatically loyal to Stalin and the Soviet Union&quot;, who once admitted that &quot;[i]f a Soviet official told me something, it was the gospel for me... If they had told me that the USSR needed it, I would have done it... [I]f they had told me to throw myself into the fire, I would have done it&quot;. Nevertheless, Pauker paradoxically promoted a number of policies counter to those of the Kremlin during the Cominform period of &quot;high Stalinism&quot;, when the Soviet Union imposed a single, hegemonic line on all its satellites. In 1948 she opposed the verification and purge of the large number of members who entered the Communist Party during the mass recruitment campaign, even though the Cominform had ordered such a verification in every Bloc country. In 1949 she opposed the construction of the Danube-Black Sea Canal, even though, according to her own testimony, Stalin had personally proposed the project. In 1949–52 she opposed the purging of the Romanian veterans of the Spanish Civil War and French Resistance as part of Moscow&#x27;s bloc-wide campaign against Josip Broz Tito or - at the very least - took no part in their repression, as they were not purged &quot;en masse&quot; in Romania until a few months after Pauker&#x27;s downfall. And she was reported by colleagues and associates to have resisted Stalin&#x27;s plans to have Justice Minister Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu put on trial, and was accused by the Securitate&#x27;s chief Soviet adviser of having &quot;sabotaged and postponed investigations&quot; in the Pătrășcanu case. (This remains a subject of debate among historians, for there is a dearth of evidence in the Romanian archives on Pauker&#x27;s position on Pătrășcanu, because all transcripts of Politburo discussions on the Pătrășcanu inquiry were summarily destroyed on the orders of General Secretary Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.)
In addition, Pauker supported, and helped facilitate, the emigration of roughly 100,000 Jews to Israel from the spring of 1950 to the spring of 1952, when all other Soviet satellites had shut their gates to Jewish emigration, and as Stalin&#x27;s policies regarding population control and strict restrictions on emigration and travel were increasingly tightened . Moreover, she firmly opposed forced collectivization that was carried out on Moscow&#x27;s orders in the summer of 1950, while she was in a Kremlin hospital undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Angrily condemning such coercion as &quot;absolutely opposed to the line of our party and absolutely opposed to any serious Communist thought&quot;, she allowed peasants forced into collective farms to return to private farming and effectively halted additional collectivization throughout 1951. This, as well as her support beginning in 1947 for higher prices for agricultural products in defiance of her Soviet &quot;advisers&quot;, along with her favoring the integration of kulaks into the emerging socialist order, led Stalin to charge that Pauker had fatefully deviated into &quot;peasantist, non-Marxist policies&quot;.

Pauker&#x27;s &quot;Moscow faction&quot; (so called because many of its members, like Pauker, had spent years in exile in Moscow) was opposed by the &quot;prison faction&quot; (most of whom had spent the Fascist period in Romanian prisons, particularly in the Doftana Prison). Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the &quot;prison faction&quot;, had supported intensified agricultural collectivization, pushed for Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu&#x27;s trial and execution, and was a rigid Stalinist; however, he resented some strains of Soviet influence (which would become clear at the time of de-Stalinization when, as leader of Communist Romania, he was a determined opponent of Nikita Khrushchev).

===Downfall and scapegoating===

Gheorghiu-Dej profited from the anti-Semitism in Stalinist policy closely linked to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s increasing paranoia, actively lobbying Stalin to take action against the Pauker faction. Gheorghiu-Dej travelled to Moscow in August 1951 to seek Stalin&#x27;s approval for purging Pauker and her allies in the Secretariat (Vasile Luca and Teohari Georgescu). But archival evidence has led Vladimir Tismăneanu to conclude that &quot;Ana Pauker&#x27;s downfall did not occur merely, or even primarily, because of Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s skillful maneuvering—as some Romanian novels published in the 1980s would have us believe—but foremost because of Stalin&#x27;s decision to initiate a major political purge in Romania.&quot; Pauker, Luca, and Georgescu were purged in May 1952, consolidating Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s own grip over country and Party.

The charges against Ana Pauker increasingly focused on her positions on Zionism and Israel. She was accused of supporting &quot;the subversive and espionage activities of the Israeli Legation and of the Zionists in the country&quot;, of making secret commitments to Israeli diplomats, of displaying a &quot;nationalist attitude on the emigration of Jews to Israel&quot;, and of divulging secrets to &quot;the enemy&quot; (the United States) through its principal agent, &quot;international Zionism.&quot;

Pauker was arrested on 18 February 1953 and subjected to tightened interrogations and a soft form of torture in preparation for a show trial, as had occurred with Rudolf Slánský and others in the Prague Trials. After Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953 she was freed from jail and put under house arrest instead—the result of the direct intervention of Vyacheslav Molotov, who reportedly acted on the insistence of his wife Polina Zhemchuzhina, a friend of Pauker&#x27;s and herself freed from prison soon after Stalin&#x27;s death. When another Party leader informed Pauker of Stalin&#x27;s death, she burst into tears—prompting her colleague to quip: &quot;Don&#x27;t cry. If Stalin were still alive, you&#x27;d be dead.&quot;

Following the Twentieth Party Congress in Moscow there were fears that Khrushchev might force the Romanian Party to rehabilitate Pauker and possibly install her as Romania&#x27;s new leader. Gheorghiu-Dej went on to accuse her, Vasile Luca, and Teohari Georgescu for their alleged Stalinist excesses in the late 1940s and early 1950. The period when all four were in power was marked by political persecution and the murder of opponents (such as the infamous brainwashing experiments conducted at Pitești prison in 1949–1952). Gheorghiu-Dej, who had as much to account for, used moments like these to ensure the survival of his policies in a post-Stalinist age.

===Later life===
In 1956, she was summoned for questioning by a high-level party commission, which insisted that she acknowledge her guilt. Again, she claimed she was innocent and demanded that she be reinstated as a party member, without success.

During her forced retirement, Pauker was allowed to work as a translator from French and German for the Editura Politică publishing house.

=== Death ===
In the spring of 1959, Pauker was diagnosed with a terminal recurrence of cancer. She died on 3 June 1960 of cardiac arrest, after the cancer had spread to her heart and lungs.

==Analysis==
Ana Pauker was recast by Romania&#x27;s leaders in the official party history as having been a staunch ultra-orthodox Stalinist, even though she had opposed or had attempted to moderate a number of Stalinist policies while she was in a leadership position. As the historian Robert Levy concluded: &quot;No other communist leader save Tito has been shown to have resisted the Soviet-imposed line [during the Cominform period of &quot;high Stalinism&quot;] as she did—whether on collectivisation, the fight against the kulaks and the urban bourgeoise, the prosecution of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, the purge of the Spanish Civil War and French Resistance veterans, the dimensions of the Five-Year Plan, the staging of a show trial of Romanian Zionists, or the facilitation of mass Jewish emigration&quot;.

==Legacy==
Ana Pauker&#x27;s legacy in Romania today is still tainted by the attempt of ruling party propagandists in the 1950s and 1960s to scapegoat her as the leader responsible for the crimes of the early Communist period. For instance, she is often referred to in Romania as &quot;Stalin with a skirt&quot; (&quot;Stalin cu fustă&quot;). Film director Radu Gabrea, who completed a feature-length documentary on Pauker in 2016, suggests that this demonising of Pauker is only possible because Pauker was a woman and of Jewish origin, and that it reflects the widespread antisemitism in Romania. 

As historian Robert Levy put it: &quot;Long the party&#x27;s propagandists&#x27; scapegoat as the source of all the horrors of the Stalinist period, Ana Pauker continues to be vilified in post-communist Romania as the party leader most culpable for the post-war years&#x27; repression. But the truth is that this perpetually contradictory figure, though a Stalinist herself, and one who played a key role in imposing Communism on Romania, paradoxically presented an alternative to the rigid, harsh Stalinism that soon emblemised Romanian party life and left a hidden legacy as a persistent patron of Romania&#x27;s peasantry within the communist hierarchy. The fall of Ana Pauker was a significant step in a process that precluded any reformist leadership from prevailing in Romania and fated its citizens to endure the extreme hardship that would culminate in the Ceaușescu regime.&quot;

== Family ==
Marcel and Ana Pauker had three children:
* Tanio (1921–1922);
* Vlad (1926–2016);
* Tatiana (1928–2011).

Though it was long alleged that she denounced the father of her three children as a Trotskyite, Comintern archival documents reveal, however, that she repeatedly refused to do so.

Ana Pauker had a fourth child, Masha (1932–2020), fathered by the Czech-Jewish Communist Eugen Fried; Masha (Maria), who was born in Moscow, was raised in France by her father. Pauker adopted a fifth child, Alexandru, in the late 1940s.

<text>Joshua Todd is an American singer. He is the frontman and last remaining original member of hard rock band Buckcherry.

== Background ==
Josh Todd grew up in Anaheim Hills, California, and later moved to Lake Forest, California. When he was 10 years old, his father died by suicide. He attended high school at Trabuco Hills High School in Orange County, California, and graduated in 1989.

Prior to his days in Buckcherry, Todd fronted the Hollywood glam rock band Slamhound. Slamhound was signed to Skydoor Records, an independent record company that was unsuccessful in releasing a Slamhound album even though the band recorded over a dozen songs with Todd as the lead singer. While in Slamhound, Todd honed his musical style, moving away from glam and more towards punk. In 1995, Todd met guitarist Keith Nelson through his tattoo artist. They soon formed the band Sparrow, which later changed its name to Buckcherry.

He later married Jasmine Lawson, an American actress and model. He is currently married to actress/model Mitzi Martin. They have two children. Todd became a certified phlebotomist during the COVID pandemic.

Todd has been sober since 1995.

== Career ==
Up to 1998, Josh was in a band, SLAMHOUND.
In 1999, even before the debut Buckcherry album had ever been released, Todd was featured in one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s last issues of 1999 as &quot;What&#x27;s Hot in the New Millennium,&quot; which included a center-fold photograph of him.

In 1999, Buckcherry released their debut self-titled album, featuring the hit &quot;Lit Up&quot;. The album had a very commercial sound, far away from the glam punk music of his earlier bands.

In 2001, the band released their second album &quot;Time Bomb&quot;. Todd and Nelson went on to play a tribute to Ozzy Osbourne/Mötley Crüe drummer, Randy Castillo, alongside former Guns N&#x27; Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum. The band, for that show, was named Cherry Roses. The band went on to record about ten songs under the name &quot;The Project&quot; before the others decided to replace Todd and Nelson with Scott Weiland and Dave Kushner, respectively. The band went on to become Velvet Revolver. One song, &quot;Dirty Little Thing&quot;, was written during the time with Todd and Nelson and gives the latter co-writing credits.

=== The band Josh Todd ===
In 2003, Josh Todd released the album &quot;You Made Me&quot; under the band name Josh Todd The band consisted of Josh Todd (Vocals), Jesse Logan (Guitars), Mike Hewitt (Guitars), Mark Lettig (Bass) and Kent Ross (Drums). The bands guitar tech was Stevie D. The album was distributed in the US by DRT Entertainment in the US, and by JVCKenwood Victor Entertainment in Japan. After returning from Japan supporting the &quot;You Made Me&quot; album, which included dates with Aerosmith and the Who, Josh Todd decided to return to the band Buckcherry. The Josh Todd band was disbanded, and TODD Entertainment was dissolved.

In 2012, JVC/Victor Entertainment re-issued and re-released the &quot;You Made Me&quot; album in Japan.

In 2022, the album was released for the first time worldwide through music streaming services and included the songs &quot;Collide&quot; and &quot;Catastrophe&quot;.

=== Return to Buckcherry ===
In 2005, Todd reformed Buckcherry with Keith Nelson and new members Stevie D., Jimmy Ashhurst, and Xavier Muriel.

In 2006, he appeared as the character Hutch in the film &quot;The Still Life&quot;.

In 2008, Todd was one of the four backing vocalists for the hard rock band Mötley Crüe for the gang vocal version of &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;.

As of 2023, Todd has released ten albums with Buckcherry and one solo album. He also performed at the Canadian Live8 venue in Barrie, Ontario in 2005. He first joined Darryl McDaniels, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer of Aerosmith, and others on stage for a rendition of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and then later joined all other performers on stage for a version of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot;.

He has appeared in several films in both credited and uncredited roles including playing the part of &quot;Rudy&quot; in the 2002 teen comedy &quot;The New Guy&quot; and several small parts in &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;. He has also appeared in the 2008 thriller &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;.

In 2008 Todd appeared on Escape the Fate&#x27;s album &quot;This War Is Ours&quot; in the songs &quot;10 Miles Wide&quot; and &quot;Harder Than You Know&quot;. He was featured in the music video for &quot;10 Miles Wide&quot; in 2009.

Todd has been ranked in the &quot;Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists&quot; by &quot;Hit Parader&quot; (#98).

Following Keith Nelson&#x27;s departure from Buckcherry in 2017, Todd is now the only original member in the band.

<text>The radical of an algebraic group is the identity component of its maximal normal solvable subgroup.
For example, the radical of the general linear group formula_1 (for a field &quot;K&quot;) is the subgroup consisting of scalar matrices, i.e. matrices formula_2 with formula_3 and formula_4 for formula_5.

An algebraic group is called semisimple if its radical is trivial, i.e., consists of the identity element only. The group formula_6 is semi-simple, for example.

The subgroup of unipotent elements in the radical is called the unipotent radical, it serves to define reductive groups.

<doc id="1088336" wikidata="Q16237842" url="?curid=1088336" title="Kuklos Adelphon">
<text>Kuklos Adelphon (also known as Kappa Alpha or ΚΑ) was an American social fraternity founded at the University of North Carolina in 1812. It was also known as old Kappa Alpha, K.A., Circle of Brothers, and the Alpha Society. The organization expanded throughout the Southern United States, not only on college campuses but also in cities where alumni settled. The society began to decline during the 1850s and disappeared after the Civil War.

== History ==
Kuklos Adelphon was established at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill in 1812. Its founders were four members of Phi Beta Kappa. As a result, its rituals, secrets, and constitution were similar to Phi Beta Kappa.

Kuklos Adelphon expanded throughout the Southern United States, not only on college campuses but also in cities where alumni settled. It did not have a centralized operation and allowed each chapter to amend its constitution and ritual as desired by its members.

In the spring of 1855, when secessionist politics caused a rift at the University of Alabama. The minority unionist faction of the chapter disclosed the secrets of the order which were published by another fraternity, leading to the chapter&#x27;s dissolution.

The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of Kuklos Adelphon dissolved in 1855 but was revived in 1858 as Kappa Alpha.

In 1858, the chapter at the University of South Carolina led a reorganization of the order and it was reconstituted as Phi Mu Omicron () but this order did not outlast the Civil War. The last Kappa Alpha chapter proper, that at the University of North Carolina, dissolved in 1866.

== Symbols and traditions ==
The fraternity&#x27;s name is derived from Ancient Greek Κύκλος Ἀδελφών, meaning &quot;Circle of Brothers.&quot; Its motto was &quot;Nil ego contulerim sanus jucundo amico&quot; or &quot;Nothing can I prefer, when sane, to a companionable friend&quot;, which is a quote from the poet Horace.

Its badge was a diamond with a circle in its center. There was a capital letter A inside the circle and the phrase Κύκλος Ἀδελφών around the outside of the circle. The initials of the fraternity&#x27;s Latin motto, NECSJA, were on the right leg of the letter A, while an image of clasping hands was on the crossbar of the letter A. The badge was supposed to be worn suspended from a blue ribbon from the member&#x27;s right lapel. The constitution specified that the badge was to be silver; however, examples in other metals are also found. Variations (pictured here) include the circle and letter A in black enamel on a white enamel background, or a diamond frame with a circle frame.

The fraternity&#x27;s seal was an equilateral triangle, with the Greek letters ΚΑ below and an open eye above.

== Chapters ==
Chapters of the society were called circles. If chapters were named in order of the Greek alphabet, there were 21 collegiate chapters established. However, the order in which the chapters were chartered is unknown. Following is a list of Kuklos Adelphon or Kappa Alpha chapters that were active in 1855.

== Controversies ==
John Lester, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan, claimed that the Klan&#x27;s initiation ritual was based on a popular collegiate fraternal order, and it has been speculated by Allen Trelease that &quot;Kuklos Adelphon almost certainly provided the model&quot; for the early Klan. In disagreement, Albert Stevens in his Cyclopaedia of Fraternities (1907), a more contemporary reference document to the date for the founding, declares the Klan took portions from the initiation ceremony of the Sons of Malta and leaves absent the name &quot;Kuklos Adelphon.&quot;

==Notable members==

* Wiliam Wallace Duncan, Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South
* Robert Kennon Hargrove, Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South
* William M. Lowe, U.S. House of Representatives

<doc id="1088339" wikidata="Q319778" url="?curid=1088339" title="Motion in limine">
<text>In U.S. law, a motion &quot;in limine&quot; (, &quot;at the start&quot;; literally, &quot;on the threshold&quot;) is a motion, discussed outside the presence of the jury, to request that certain testimony be excluded. A motion &quot;in limine&quot; can also be used to get a ruling to allow for the inclusion of evidence. The motion is decided by a judge in both civil and criminal proceedings. It is frequently used at pre-trial hearings or during trial, and it can be used at both the state and federal levels.

&quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; (8th ed. 2004) defines &quot;motion &quot;in limine&quot; as &quot;a pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or offered at trial.&quot; They are made &quot;preliminary&quot;, and are presented for consideration of the judge, arbitrator or hearing officer, to be decided without the merits being reached first.

The reasons for the motions are wide and varied, but probably the most frequent use of the motion &quot;in limine&quot; in a criminal trial is to shield the jury from information concerning the defendant that could possibly be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant if heard at trial. Other reasons arise under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to comply with discovery.

Other proper subjects for motions &quot;in limine&quot; stem from the court&#x27;s power to &quot;Provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it&quot; and to &quot;[c]ontrol its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice&quot;. These procedural motions &quot;in limine&quot; may include motions to control the conduct of the prosecutor, motions for separate trials on counts, prior convictions, and/or enhancements, motions to control the courtroom environment, motions to control jury conduct, and other such motions.

A motion &quot;in limine&quot; is distinct from a motion for a protective order, which is a request to prevent the discovery of evidence, and a motion to suppress, which can be raised by the defense in American criminal trials to prevent the admission of evidence that was obtained unconstitutionally.

== Governing laws ==
Most motions &quot;in limine&quot; in federal courts are governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Some others arise under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to comply with discovery.

== Example ==
Examples of motions &quot;in limine&quot; would be that the attorney for the defendant may ask the judge to refuse to admit into evidence any personal information, or medical, criminal or financial records, using the legal grounds that these records are irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or unduly prejudicial, and/or that their probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial result to the defendant, or that the admittance of such information or evidence would otherwise violate one of the court&#x27;s rules of evidence. A party proffering certain evidence can also ask for the admission of certain information or evidence via a motion &quot;in limine&quot;.

If the motion &quot;in limine&quot; to exclude evidence is granted, then the excluded records are prohibited from being presented without specific approval from the judge at the time the party wants to offer the evidence. A reference to such &quot;highly prejudicial&quot; evidence contrary to the tribunal&#x27;s order is a ground for a mistrial.

<doc id="1088341" wikidata="Q982809" url="?curid=1088341" title="Mrinal Sen">
<text>Mrinal Sen (14 May 1923 – 30 December 2018) was a Bengali film director and screenwriter known for his work primarily in Bengali, and a few Hindi and Telugu language films. Regarded as one of the finest Indian filmmakers, along with his contemporaries Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, and Tapan Sinha, Sen played a major role in the New Wave cinema of India. He also served as the President of FTII from 1984 to 1986.

Sen received various national and international honors including eighteen Indian National Film Awards. The Government of India honored him with the Padma Bhushan, and the Government of France honored him with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, while Russian Government honored him with the Order of Friendship. Sen was also awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest award for filmmakers in India. 

He was one of the few Indian filmmakers to have won awards at the big three film festivals viz., Cannes, Venice and the Berlinale. Sen was a self described &quot;private Marxist&quot;.

==Influence==
Mrinal Sen directed &quot;Bhuvan Shome&quot; (&quot;Mr. Shome&quot;, 1969) which initiated the &quot;New Wave Cinema Movement&quot; in India.

===Film craft, Social context and its political influence===
The films that he made next were essentially political, and earned him the reputation as a Marxist artist. This was also the time of large-scale political unrest throughout India. Particularly in and around Calcutta, this period underwent what is now known as the Naxalite movement. This phase was immediately followed by a series of films where he shifted his focus, and instead of looking for enemies outside, he looked for the enemy within his own middle class society. This was arguably his most creative phase.

===Depiction of Kolkata===
In many Mrinal Sen movies from &quot;Punascha&quot; (1961) to &quot;Mahaprithivi&quot; (1992), Kolkata features prominently. He has shown Kolkata as a character, and as an inspiration. He has beautifully woven the people, value system, class difference and the roads of the city into his movies and coming of age for Kolkata, his El-Dorado.

==Recognition==

In 1982 he was a member of the jury at the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival. In 1983 he was a member of the jury at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1997 Sen became the member of the jury at the 20th Moscow International Film Festival.
On 24 July 2012, Sen was not invited to the function organised by Government of West Bengal to felicitate film personalities from the State. As per reports, his political views are believed to be the reason for his omission from the function.

==Death==
Sen had age-related ailments for many years. He died on 30 December 2018 at the age of 95 at his home in Bhawanipore, Kolkata. The cause was a heart attack.

<doc id="1088344" wikidata="Q476750" url="?curid=1088344" title="Twelve Girls Band">
<text>12 Girls Band (, sometimes abbreviated to 女樂 or 女乐) are an all-female Chinese musical group that initially consisted of twelve members before the addition of a thirteenth. Twelve Girls Band use traditional Chinese instruments to play both traditional Chinese and Western music. Formed on June 18, 2001, the women were selected by audition from more than 4,000 contestants. Each woman is classically-trained, and the band members come from various conservatories in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), including the China Academy of Music, the Chinese National Orchestra, and the Central Conservatory of Music.

==History==
Chinese numerology gave Wang Xiao-Jing the idea for the &quot;Twelve Girls Band&quot;. When Xiao-Jing decided he wanted to create a female ensemble, he knew it needed 12 members. Per Chinese mythology it is the twelve jinchai (12 hairpins) representing womanhood. For the new project, the women were inspired by the art of the Yue Fang, the ensembles who played in the Tang dynasty courts during the years A.D. 618 to 907.

The group debuted their modern compositions on ancient instruments in China and Japan during the Northern summer of 2003. In Japan their debut album topped the charts for 30 weeks. Their debut album, entitled &quot;Eastern Energy,&quot; was released in North America in August 2004 with cover versions of Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Clocks&quot; and Enya&#x27;s &quot;Only Time&quot; included, and a massive television advertising campaign announcing the group&#x27;s arrival.

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhuanet) -- Chinese mainland performers the 12 Girls Band have launched their new album &quot;Shining Energy&quot; in Hong Kong, reported CRIENGLISH.com. Dressed in stunning red outfits, the girls performed a few tracks in front of the assembled media on Wednesday. The band has been a big hit in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore. At the beginning of 2017, they held a concert in Japan and tickets sold out in 8 minutes.

Among the instruments used by the women: erhu (Chinese fiddle), pipa (pear-shaped lute), guzheng (zither), yangqin (hammered dulcimer), dizi (transverse flute), and xiao (vertical flute). Occasionally, the duxianqin (single-stringed zither) and hulusi (three-piped gourd flute) are employed.

== Performances ==

In July 2003, &quot;Beautiful Energy&quot;, their first album in Japan, reached the top of the J-pop chart. They won Japan Gold Disc Award in 2004.

The Twelve Girls Band toured in the United States in 2004 &quot;Miracles&quot; tour and again in 2005.

On July 7, 2007, the Twelve Girls Band performed at the Chinese leg of Live Earth in Shanghai, and were accompanied by the Mexican folk singer Lila Downs.

The Italian soprano Giorgia Fumanti performed with the group in October and November 2007, on their North American tour. The tour traveled to the Midwest, and the East and West Coast areas of the USA and Canada.

In 2008, the yang qin player Ma Jing Jing did concerts playing the yangqin and guzheng.

<text>Starstruck is an American science fiction comic book series. It is based on the off-Broadway stage play of the same name written by Elaine Lee, with contributions from Susan Norfleet Lee and Dale Place. An audio drama has also appeared.

==Overview==
&quot;Starstruck&quot;, in comics form, has been produced at various intervals since 1982 by writer Elaine Lee and artist Michael Wm. Kaluta; their primary collaborators are colorist Lee Moyer and letterer Todd Klein. The series, epic in scope, has been carried across multiple comic companies, amongst them Marvel Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and IDW Publishing. It was collected in a revised and recolored hardcover book form as &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; in 2011.

Since its inception, &quot;Starstruck&quot; has built a cult audience and critical acclaim from peers, periodicals, and fans for the sophistication of its storytelling. Most noted is the predominantly female cast, portrayed by Lee with a range and nuance that confounds gender stereotypes. Kaluta, an esteemed veteran of comics and illustration, is often commended for the virtuosity and imaginative detail of his artwork. Also, the series is cited for the progressiveness of its rich and complex structure: &quot;Starstruck&quot; preceded &quot;Watchmen&quot; in using innovations like nonlinear storytelling, overlapping dialogue, multiple story threads, back-up text, unreliable narrators, adjunct stories, underlying themes, recurring symbols, and an almost symphonic interconnectedness.

==Premise==
The story is set in an anarchic future in which humanity spans the universe. The Dread Dictator has fallen and a power vacuum sparks a chess game of eccentric players scheming for control. The serio-comic stories follow Captain Galatia 9 and her running partner, Brucilla The Muscle, as they navigate madcap scenarios and surreal misadventures in between the galactic infighting.

==Play==

Elaine Lee herself played the adventurous lead, Captain Galatia 9, while Lee&#x27;s sister, Susan Norfleet Lee played her rowdy pilot, Brucilla the Muscle. Noted illustrator Michael Wm. Kaluta played a major role in visual aspects of the play, working on sets, costumes and promotional material. The story is set in the future, and features several strong female lead characters. A strange and gleefully corrupt future version of the Girl Guides, the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot;, are introduced in a subplot that leads to the climax. The &quot;Starstruck&quot; play was produced in 1980, with another staging in 1983.

The script of the play () was published in 1985 and is still available. An audioplay adaption was recorded in 2010, and released on CD and download.

===Background and creation===
Elaine Lee was an actor in the late 1970s New York City theatre and television scene. She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her work on the long-running NBC soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;; she portrayed the troubled Mildred Trumble, a character modeled after Sissy Spacek&#x27;s character, Pinky Rose from Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;3 Women&quot;. Seeing a lack of range and depth in the roles being offered to female actors, she formed a Manhattan theatre company with her sister, Susan Norfleet Lee, and actor friends which they called Wild Hair Productions. The Lees wrote their own plays for the company to star in, starting with &quot;Brief Cases&quot;.

During the writing of a second play, &quot;The Contamination of the Kokomo Lounge&quot;, Elaine began pulling together ideas for a science fiction play. The Lee sisters were at a Manhattan bar/cafe called The Library, discussing ideas over a pile of science fiction magazines when illustrator Michael Wm. Kaluta, a neighbor who often sketched there, approached them asking, &quot;Are you science fiction fans?&quot; Elaine kept his card for the future. Elaine Lee was subsequently impressed by seeing Kaluta&#x27;s art in the West Side Comics store, on a poster showcasing The Studio, an art collective he shared with Barry Windsor Smith, Jeffrey Jones, and Berni Wrightson. Kaluta was impressed by the wit and range of their second play: he recalled thinking: &quot;If they&#x27;re going to do a science fiction play, they&#x27;re going to do it very well&quot;.

Elaine Lee&#x27;s first draft was on a stack of 5x7 index cards. Lee wrote all the drafts of the script, with some dialogue suggestions from Susan Norfleet and Dale Place. The quality of the material persuaded Kaluta to create the show poster. He became the costume designer after asking what costumes the actors would wear in the poster, and the set designer when the regular one got sick. Kaluta told an interviewer backstage about the evolution of his role: &quot;Should it be like a real 1930s movie poster? That&#x27;s when I realized I wanted to do characterizations of the entire cast on the poster. But, I had to know what they looked like. So that&#x27;s when I started designing the costumes. Because I designed them so intricately, I had to build them. And that&#x27;s when my house started looking like the garment district&quot;.

&quot;Starstruck&quot; was being created in the late 1970s period of New York City&#x27;s decline, when poor musicians in Punk and free jazz were making a rising scene out of cheap rents, collective venues, and street throwaways. Kaluta said: &quot;You could build an entire city on the stuff the city throws away, just sitting out there&quot;. The resulting sets, designed in the style of classic science fiction serials, used Hot Wheels tracks, walkie talkies, medical splints, medicine jars full of marbles, Bingo chips, coffee lids, and plastic cups, which Kaluta glue-gunned together with help from his colleague, Fantasy illustrator Charles Vess.

The &quot;Starstruck&quot; play received its first national coverage in an article in &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine #41 in December 1980, which included an interview of Lee and Kaluta, along with Kaluta&#x27;s design sketches, and stage photos by Sean Smith.

==Comics==
The characters and stories of &quot;Starstruck&quot; have continued in comics form across multiple comic companies, but primarily &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, Epic, Dark Horse, and IDW.

===Background and creation===
The &quot;Starstruck&quot; play had been optioned by a producer in 1980, which bound Lee from developing any further stage versions for a year. Kaluta saw a solution but with some reluctance: &quot;Though I did suggest Elaine do a comic book version of the play when all the rest of the rights were tied up by the then producer, I didn&#x27;t want to draw the comic book&quot;. Kaluta had initially made his fame as illustrator of The Shadow comics for DC Comics in the early 1970s, and was now hesitant to take such a big project on. They also assessed that a dialogue-heavy script on two simple sets would not translate well to the big action and quick captions of comics. Kaluta said: &quot;But the material, and, especially Elaine&#x27;s witty approach to everything she writes set a small fire under me&quot;.

They found the solution in the backdrop. The stage play had moments where the narrator sketched the backgrounds of each character. Lee and Kaluta had worked out an elaborate backstory of the future time period, the political landscape, the pasts and futures of the characters, and many new characters not seen in the play. This scope of myth-building, inspired by the spirit of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, had been beyond their resources to stage or film. Adapting that dynamic epic to comics proved a better solution than simply adapting the play.

By 1980, creator-owned comics published by independent comics publishers were now being sold in an emerging network of comics stores. Lee and Kaluta took this opportunity to expand their storytelling while retaining sole ownership and control of their creative property. Lee would script and Kaluta would illustrate prequel stories that expanded the backdrop and character relationships in a lead-up to the events of the stage play. Since DC and Marvel Comics were dominated by superheroes, the first market they looked at was the mature comic magazines of Europe.

Their initial model was &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, which channeled the adult fantasy serials of France&#x27;s &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;. Lee told an interviewer: &quot;The stuff in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; completely blew me away and I wanted to do a play that was something like the stories they published&quot;. One year earlier, the original path for &quot;Starstruck&quot; had been paved when a fight scene between two women that Elaine had written reminded actor Dale Place of the style of Heavy Metal: &quot;Oh, that would be fun, to do a kind of science fiction play&quot; for her company, the writer recounted. Kaluta was a fan of the contributing artist Moebius, particularly his kinetic line and non-linear, surprising stories. The &quot;Starstruck&quot; prequel series they first produced were firmly in the template of these magazines; hallucinogenic narratives, elaborate fine art, epic backdrops, farcical humor, and adult themes, printed in serialized segments across many issues.

&quot;Starstruck&quot;&#x27;s move from New York stage play to comic series anticipated a similar path for &quot;Warp!&quot;. This 1971 sci-fi play had played a limited run on Broadway, with Art Direction by comics innovator (and Kaluta&#x27;s friend/mentor) Neal Adams. It eventually became a comic series from First Comics in 1983, after &quot;Starstruck&quot;. Another contemporary parallel is &quot;A Distant Soil&quot;, a challenging sci-fi/fantasy series by writer/artist Colleen Doran which had print runs and revised expansions across multiple alternative comic companies, also starting in 1983.

The first serials of &quot;Starstruck&quot; comics were printed in Spain&#x27;s &quot;Ilustracion+Comix Internacional&quot;, and then America&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, in 1982.

==Story==
Centuries in the future, Earth&#x27;s population has been halved by a nuclear war. Humanity has emigrated out into the universe, colonizing worlds and interacting with aliens. Various regimes have held power, most recently The Great Dictator. After his overthrow by revolutionaries, a power struggle rages on between his heirs, the Bajars, and the revolutionary leaders, the Medeas. Mary Medea fakes her death and begins an elaborate plan to eventually take control and stabilize the anarchic era. Disguised as a new player, Queen Glorianna, she orchestrates a web of interconnections to achieve what will one day be called The Great Change. The story follows the various pawns and rivals in the game, in evolving stages of their lives and of the scheme, as they all eventually meet and collide. In particular the story focuses on the backstories of Galatia 9, a freedom-fighter amazon, and Brucilla The Muscle, a good-natured hothead pilot; where they came from, how they meet, and what happens because of it.

Kaluta explained: &quot;As the books progress, the reader gets a slow reveal of the greater energies and alliances by the way they impact the lives of the happy-go-lucky space girls and boys eking out their bits of the big ball of wax&quot;.

==Characters==
Lee and Kaluta frequently told interviewers they wanted to step away from good-vs.-evil characters to tell stories of flawed people who were too slippery for such boundaries. The writer said: &quot;In our comic book the &#x27;good guys&#x27; are not all good, and the &#x27;bad guys&#x27; are not totally bad, and the characters do really stupid things. These characters all have faults. [But they] get smarter, just as people learn things in life&quot;. The artist said: &quot;There is no ruler of the universe making other people dance. But there&#x27;s lots of people in the comic who think they&#x27;re making other people dance. And that&#x27;s where the fun is, to watch the characters delude themselves&quot;.

The cast of the comics are based on the likenesses of the original stage ensemble. Lee explains that when they started the first serials: &quot;Michael drew the characters in &quot;Starstruck&quot; to look like the actors in the original production&quot;. This included the troupe of Wild Hair Productions as well as extended friends. The writer said: &quot;If you had walked into one of our parties, you would think you had walked into a party on Rec Station 97!&quot;

Queen Glorianna / Mary Medea: The Medea family were revolutionaries who overthrew The Great Dictator, P.A.H.M. Bajar. The ongoing feud between the families motivates Mary Medea to go underground in plain sight as the mystical Queen Glorianna. Her ownership of the lucrative Krystal asteroid mines empowers her complex, secretive plan to manipulate a better, progressive future.

Galatia 9: Molly Medea was ostracized from the family in her youth and ended up initiated with the Omegazons, an amazon colony. By wily means she ended up captaining her own fighter ship, The Harpy, and brought in Brucilla as her partner.

Erotica Ann: The last of a line of pleasure droids, Annie achieves awareness and slowly evolves a consciousness. As an initial instrument of Glorianna&#x27;s plan, she threads the lives of the Bajars with the Harpy crew.

Verloona Tï: The wicked stepsister of Galatia 9, a vain and power-hungry vamp with unspeakable appetites.

Kalif Bajar: The idiot great-grandson of The Great Dictator, Kalif is unhealthily attached to a destroyed Erotica Ann model. He eventually colludes with Verloona.

Lucrezia Bajar / Ronnie Lee Ellis: The smart twin sister of Kalif Bajar, Lucrezia chafes at being passed over for power because of her gender. As the spectacularly successful author Ronnie Lee Ellis, she orchestrates her own counter-scheme to Glorianna, controlling the vapid nuns of the Cloistered Order of the Cosmic Veil.

Rah El Rex: A schizophrenic dandy who thinks he is being controlled by a being called The Great Disrupter, Rex eventually allies with Verloona.

Harry Palmer: Seen first as a bartender, Harry was actually a soldier with Mary Medea, and transfers his love for her to Erotica Ann, her double.

Randall Factor: A casino owner on the infamous intergalactic watering hole Recreation Station 97, Randall is &#x27;the random factor&#x27; whose ties to Glorianna and Harry might not guarantee where his interests lie.

Galactic Girl Guides: Young girls have to grow up tough in an anarchic galaxy; a corps of shamelessly shifty and street-smart &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; permeates the cosmos, made up of little girls with fast hands and nimble plans.

==Publication history==
&quot;Starstruck&quot; has essentially been the original 80 pages, printed in serial form and a graphic novel; and then six new issues of Epic Comics. This material was expanded by 100 pages for Dark Horse Comics (up to and including Epic #1); this same material was later refined and recolored for IDW Publishing.

This is known as &quot;Volume 1&quot;, and was collected in the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot;. Two or three more volumes are planned, with 220 pages of unpublished new story material expanding the remaining five Epic issues.

===&quot;Comix Internacional&quot; (1982)===
The first &quot;Starstruck&quot; stories were printed in Spain starting in April 1982, in the anthology magazine &quot;Ilustracion+Comix Internacional&quot; #17. The magazine was an equivalent to &quot;Metal Hurlant&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, printing countercultural science fiction and fantasy comics with adult themes and sexuality. Editor Josep Toutain was an artist and artists agent representing the wave of Spanish talent who had rejuvenated Warren Publishing titles like &quot;Vampirella&quot; and &quot;Creepy&quot; in the mid-1970s; he ran the European branch of Warren, then took it over, and expanded into other imprints and graphic novels. Toutain also reprinted innovative strips by American artists like Will Eisner, Richard Corben, and Howard Chaykin, and it was in his variation of Warren&#x27;s Comix International that &quot;Starstruck&quot; made its debut.

The color was provided by an uncredited Spanish coloring house, which added rich watercolor-esque hues working from the color cues provided by Kaluta.

The stories ran as serialized vignettes across seven issues: from April to November 1982, skipping the September issue and doubling the length in the October issue.

&quot;Starstruck&quot; was on the front cover of &quot;Ilustracion+Comix Internacional &quot;#17 (April 1982), featuring Kaluta&#x27;s watercolor art of the warrior/poet droid, Veep 7, and the large headline &quot;Estrenamos Aqui un Espectaculo de Broadway Llevado al Comic por Mike W. Kaluta y Elaine Lee: Starstruck&quot;. It also appeared on the front cover of &quot;Ilustracion+Comix Internacional&quot; #23, using a portrait piece of Erotica Ann from the limited edition &quot;Starstruck&quot; portfolio, printed in color for the first time. The headline read &quot;La Increible Fantasia de Mike Kaluta&quot;.

===&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1982)===
The &quot;Starstruck&quot; stories were then picked up for their first American publication by &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, edited by Julie Simmons-Lynch. They were run as chapters averaging about seven to eight pages each across nine issues from November 1982, to July 1983.

&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; traded often on Kaluta&#x27;s fame in comic art circles, running bylines for him on the front and back covers to promote interest. &quot;Starstruck&quot; was front-loaded as the first story in the initial issues.

The magazine&#x27;s Art Director at the time was John Workman, who would also letter much of the later Epic Comics run, as well as the eventual &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; back-up stories.

The English lettering was done by Todd Klein, who was then beginning his career.

In the seventh issue, May 1983, a five-page article was included by contributing Editor Stephen Maloff, with an overview of the play&#x27;s two productions and its transition into mature comics. The Lee and Kaluta interviews were supplemented with art and color photos of the stage play shot by Sean Smith.

===&quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; (1984)===
The entirety of the &quot;Comix Internacional/Heavy Metal&quot; stories were published together in their first collected form in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; No. #13 in September 1984, titled &quot;Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked&quot;. 

This publication retained the Spanish color, with a few tweaks and additions in the stories. When Marvel editorial expressed concern at the violence in a scene where space Amazons defeat beastly hillbillies, Elaine Lee added a war song that repeated the refrain: &quot;The Dromes were bad [repeated six times]/ so we had to kill them&quot;.

Marvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter recommended cutting three pages, and adding three new pages. The sequence with young Bronwyn falling into the tank of empathic merpeople was cut from the graphic novel, but restored and expanded in the later Dark Horse series.

The subtitle was a lyric quote from Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1964 song &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;.

The graphic novel, dedicated to director Robert Altman and author Thomas Pynchon, included a four-page glossary in the back that expanded upon references in the story, much in the spirit of the concurrent work of Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. This became an ongoing tradition in future issues.

&quot;Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked&quot; was nominated for a Jack Kirby Award as the Best Graphic Album of 1985.

===Epic Comics (1985)===
Marvel&#x27;s imprint, Epic Comics, was created as an outlet for creator-owned, mature, experimental comics series. Editor Archie Goodwin spun the acclaim and success of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; graphic novel into an ongoing series by Lee and Kaluta. These were the first story expansions past the initial run of serial stories printed in &quot;Ilustracion+Comix International&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, and the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot;.

A Marvel promotional magazine, &quot;Marvel Age&quot; #15 (June 1984), ran a cover story on Archie Goodwin and his editing of the new Epic comics titles and &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; magazine. A cover cartoon of Epic characters by Rick Parker included Brucilla the Muscle as well as her Tiger Brigade shark ship; oddly, no mention was made of the impending &quot;Starstruck&quot; graphic novel released two months later, or the new Epic book series seven months away.

The new series ran for six bi-monthly issues cover-dated from February 1985, to February 1986. Archie Goodwin took a hands-off approach to editing, saying &quot;I could edit this, but I would ruin it&quot;.

The first two issues were colored by Elaine Lee, and then followed by Steve Oliff. The first two were lettered by Ken Bruzenak, and then followed by the creators&#x27; former &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; colleague John Workman.

The story arc introduced Harry Palmer, a character inspired by noir detective fiction who opened the doors on much of Queen Glorianna&#x27;s past and her future plans. Lee cites this as her favorite character, and the only love story she ever wrote.

A trio of &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; became a running thread through the issues. One of the Guides would become a crucial historian in the future, the person credited for all the barbed and humorous Glossary entries.

The Epic issues ran ads for purchasing the two &quot;Starstruck&quot; T-shirts, the art portfolio, and the stage play script.

&quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; #57 ran an article by comic historian and writer Peter Sanderson about the new Epic series, featuring Brucilla the Muscle on the cover, on October 15, 1984. It extensively covered the origins and outgrowth of &quot;Starstruck&quot; from the two stage productions into the serial comics stories, and was the first article to extend coverage to the new bi-monthly comic book. Lee and Kaluta were interviewed, with comic and portfolio art, and stage photos.

A cover story and career overview with Michael Kaluta appeared in &quot;Comics Journal&quot; #103 (November 1985). The cover featured &quot;Starstruck&quot;&#x27;s Erotica Ann disrobing from The Shadow&#x27;s cloak while saying, &quot;Is this really what it takes to get your attention?&quot; Kaluta spoke at length about the genesis and development of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; play and comics. &quot;Comics Journal&quot; #111 featured an extensive review of &quot;Starstruck&quot; in September 1986, praising it for its intelligence and progressive approach to gender and sexual identity issues.

Kaluta&#x27;s cover for &quot;Marvel Age&quot; #26 (July 1985) featured a Kaluta cover of Brucilla the Muscle with Malcolm Trueheart thrown over her shoulder, a gender-flipped spoof of a popular Dave Stevens drawing of the Rocketeer with Betty thrown over his shoulder. In the oval frame surrounding the figures, sign language hands using finger spelling cues signal the phrase, &quot;Thanks Dave, Cliff, and Betty!&quot;

The cover for the Colorado Comic Art Con V program book (1985) featured art by Kaluta of &quot;Starstruck&quot; characters Galatia 9 and Brucilla the Muscle.

===Comico Comic (1987)===
After the Epic Comics series ended, Lee and Kaluta tried a different approach. They created two stories about the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot;, published as back-up strips in Dave Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Rocketeer Adventure Magazine&quot; from in 1987 and &#x27;88. These stories focused on the youthful misadventures of Brucilla the Muscle and her two friends as they became Guides, and were done in a lighter slapstick tone in the tradition of Huey, Dewey, and Louie and Our Gang. Fantasy illustrator Charles Vess, a long-time colleague of Kaluta&#x27;s who had helped him create costumes and props for the play, was the inker.

Lee and Kaluta intended this kid-friendly approach, without the trappings of the epic backstory, as an easier portal to the &quot;Starstruck&quot; universe for new readers. More stories were planned until a long lag in continuing the Rocketeer&#x27;s adventures put the idea on hold, but the &quot;Guides&quot; series would be returned to in the coming years.

===Dark Horse Comics (1990)===
When Dark Horse Comics contacted Kaluta for a job, he thought they were approaching him for continuing &quot;Starstruck&quot;. Editor Randy Spradley was delighted by the idea, and the first &quot;Starstruck&quot; revival began. Dark Horse had noted that Epic Comics series which, like &quot;Starstruck&quot;, had not sold well in the limited release of comic stores were finding their audiences as collected trade collections, such as &quot;Moonshadow&quot; and &quot;&quot;. They felt the time was now fortuitous to do a new graphic novel collection.

Lee and Kaluta unveiled &quot;Starstruck: The Expanding Universe&quot;. Instead of starting with new stories or just collecting the finished ones into a trade paperback, the two creators decided to essentially start over: the initial series would actually be the original graphic novel and Epic issues, but with huge expansions of new story and art inside of them, to be followed by all-new material encompassing the remaining stories they had not done yet. They envisioned three printing arcs, each a volume in the total history of &quot;Starstruck&quot;.

The first four issues were published as &quot;Volume 1&quot; from August 1990, to March 1991, with over 100 pages of new material that substantially redefined and expanded everything printed before. &quot;Volume 1&quot; included the graphic novel, the expanded material, and ended after the first Epic Comics issue.

In the editorial page of the premiere issue, the publishing plan was outlined: there would be 12 total issues, divided as three volumes; each volume would be four issues each, separated with short publishing breaks between, and would include a total of 320 pages of new material, &quot;Volume 2&quot; would have continued into the Epic issues, expanding greatly on the Harry Palmer storyline. It was left undefined in the press release whether the third volume would also consist of the remaining Epic issues with new material, or instead be all-new material following those stories, such as an adaption of the stage play itself, or a dramatization of the &quot;Great Change&quot; event that the series&#x27; Glossary often refers to as the ultimate fruition of the narrative.

The four issues were printed this time in black-and-white. This was the first time that the initial 80 pages of the graphic novel material had been printed in the smaller comic book size. Because that art had originally been formatted for a magazine medium with squarer dimensions, these pages now had about 20% white space at the bottom of the more rectangular comics format pages. This evened out in the latter part of the fourth issue, with the reprinting of the first Epic Comics issue, which was originally done in the regular comic size dimensions.

Todd Klein returned, supplementing his original lettering of the Graphic Novel era stories by completely re-lettering the reprint of &quot;Epic&quot; #1, which had first been lettered by Ken Bruzenak.

The second issue began the introductory story summaries by fan Lee Moyer, who would later renovate the series with his lavish color for the IDW remastered revival.

The Dark Horse issues ran ads for purchasing the two &quot;Starstruck&quot; T-shirts, the portfolio, and the stage play script. Dark Horse also used a &quot;Starstruck&quot; character on the cover of their anthology series, &quot;Cheval Noir&quot; #18 (May 1991); a painting by Kaluta of the fighter droid Veep 7.

Kaluta did the cover and some amount of new interior art for the unpublished fifth issue which would begin &quot;Volume 2&quot;, but - while simultaneously doing production design for various TV shows - a state of exhaustion wore him down. Dark Horse printed no further issues after the fourth, leaving the series revival in hiatus.

===Tundra Comics (1990s)===
Through the 1990s, attempts were made to continue &quot;Starstruck&quot; in some comics form. In interviews, Kaluta has detailed a successive attempt to do new &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; stories. Five issues intended for Tundra Publishing were plotted by him along with writer Phil Trumbo, and illustrated by Linda Medley with lettering by Todd Klein. Lee recalls: &quot;Michael and I were supposed to have done the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; for Kevin Eastman&#x27;s company, Tundra Comics. But when Tundra was bought by Kitchen Sink, the project was cancelled&quot;.

Kaluta&#x27;s website mentions that in 1996 he was &quot;(s)till drawing &quot;Starstruck, the Expanding Universe&quot; for Dark Horse Comics. The first collection is to be published by Marlowe &amp; Co. in the fall of 1996. Marlowe chokes and refuses to publish. Project dead&quot;. This implied that there was a chance at a graphic novel collection of the Volume 1 expanded stories, while Kaluta was also working further on completing expanded story art for Volume 2.

In 1995, Kaluta contributed art to a story in Elaine Lee&#x27;s erotic comics collection, &quot;Skin Tight Orbit Volume 1&quot;, which takes place in the &quot;Starstruck&quot; universe; the story, &quot;The Next Best Thing...&quot; was initially published in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. Three other stories drawn by Mary Wilshire star a character who looks like Galatia 9 and have references to &quot;Starstruck&quot; such as the Handi Andy pleasure droid.

===IDW revival (2009)===
In 2009, IDW Publishing began to publish &quot;Starstruck&quot; comic book series. These 13 monthly issues were a remastering of the Dark Horse &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; series: the original graphic novel, the 100 pages of added material, and the first Epic Comics issue. Kaluta now expanded the bulk of the art pages from the square format to the full rectangular format with new art. Painter Lee Moyer did a lush and complex revamping of all the color using contemporary digital technology. Besides the revised version of &quot;Volume 1&quot;, the two &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; stories first printed by Comico would now be reprinted along with several other unpublished GGG stories from that era, inked by Charles Vess and lettered by John Workman.

Additionally, there were new pin-ups, and revised entries in the Glossary. Fan artists were given a spotlight in a few issues: CG diagrams of the ship, The Harpy, were provided by Walt Carter; and Kristina Carroll did a painting of art assassin Kettle Black in a scene alluded to in text but never previously shown before. A new color fumetti-story concluded the final issue, using some of Sean Smith&#x27;s play photos, which included Elaine Lee as Galatia 9 and Susan Norfleet Lee as Brucilla the Muscle.

The first issue was released on August 12, 2009 and the series was completed in September 2010. The final afterword stated, &quot;This is not the end! The saga will continue!&quot;

=== IDW: &quot;Old Proldiers Never Die&quot; (2017) ===
Crowdfunded in 2013 and published by IDW in 2017, &quot;Old Proldiers Never Die&quot; is a new six-issue story arc about Harry Palmer searching for Annie.

==Collected editions==
As already mentioned, &quot;Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked&quot; came out as a Marvel original graphic novel.
&quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot;, a hardcover collection of the expanded and remastered series, was released from IDW on March 29, 2011 ().

This larger-format (8.5&quot; x 12&quot;) omnibus contained the remastered IDW issues; the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; back-up stories; an introduction by writer Mike Carey; a history of &quot;Starstruck&quot;&#x27;s evolution from Tym Stevens; a fumetti story using Sean Smith&#x27;s stage photos; a gallery of pin-ups and covers; and the expanded Glossary.

The &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; essentially reprints &quot;Volume 1&quot; of the Dark Horse era &quot;Starstruck: The Expanding Universe&quot;: specifically, the original serials that were collected as the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot;, plus the first issue of Epic Comics, and the 100 pages of new story and art that Lee and Kaluta laced through them in 1990. Additionally the art was newly increased by 20% on each page by Kaluta in 2009, and new color was painted by Lee Moyer. The volume ends with &quot;To Be Continued&quot;, and various reproductions of Harry Palmer indicate that &quot;Volume 2&quot; will focus on the second and third Epic Comics issues with new, expanded story and art. &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; was designed by Elaine Lee and Lee Moyer.

IDW published a softcover version of the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot;, starting on August 22, 2012 (). The new edition was slightly smaller (7.25&quot; x 11&quot;), with the same contents as the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; and new cover art by Kaluta.

In June 2014, IDW published &quot;Starstruck Treasury Edition&quot;. This reprinted the original Marvel Comics graphic novel collection of 1984 in a 72-page softcover, now in a larger (9.25&quot; x 14.25&quot;) format.

==Art and composition==
&quot;Starstruck&quot; stories reference diverse elements of pop culture, science fiction, and international art. Michael Kaluta drew on his varied artistic influences to directly homage or indirectly parallel these inspirations, including Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Golden Age illustrators, Pulp magazine covers, EC Comics, Métal Hurlant, and Anime.

Kaluta references classic fine art and illustrative design often in his work: &quot;My drawing &#x27;style&#x27; came from my attempts to draw like all the artists I was impressed with. Although some of them were certainly Comic Book artists, many more were illustrators and designers from the turn of the 19th Century&quot;. A crucial event in the finale of the Epic issue #6 features an island that tributes the painting, &quot;Isle Of The Dead&quot; (Basil version, 1880) by symbolist Arnold Bocklin. The use of circle border frames in compositions, serpentine forms in architecture and fabric, and elegant pantomime in characters like Queen Glorianna continue the Art Nouveau poster work of Alphonse Mucha and paintings of Gustav Klimt. His grand panoramas of mountains are in the tradition of Maxfield Parrish. The panoplies of intricate columned palaces recall Art Nouveau cartoonist Winsor McCay&#x27;s Little Nemo. The fluid body language and theatrical framing of characters is in the spirit of comics innovator Will Eisner: Kaluta specified: &quot;Anybody who doesn&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve studied this Will Eisner fellow just hasn&#x27;t looked at my work. He&#x27;s the man&quot;.

The technology he draws pays visual nods to many retro styles of science fiction design, as well as contemporaneous styles. On the classic side, the rockets and pistols of Dick Calkins&#x27; &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comic strip art and from &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serials; and the spaceship interiors of EC Comics artists like Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel: Kaluta wrote of his mentor: &quot;Seeing what Roy Krenkel accomplished with line, shape and negative space stirred my imagination and set my nascent abilities onto a highway into my future as an artist&quot;. On the modern end, the curved plastic modularity of 1960s Italian futuristic furniture design (such as by designer Joe Columbo); the rundown quality of it in films like &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;; and the linework of Moebius, such as the arid and surrealistic landscapes in his series &quot;Arzach&quot; and &quot;The Airtight Garage&quot;, as well as in spacesuit designs like Brucilla The Muscle&#x27;s pilot suit. Kaluta has a professed admiration for Manga and Anime stalwarts like Katsuhiro Otomo (&quot;Akira&quot;) and Masamune Shirow (&quot;Ghost In the Shell&quot;); many of those style hallmarks show in his design for the Samarai-esque droid, Veep 7. Kaluta told an Italian interviewer: &quot;I like Otomo&#x27;s style, and that of Hayao Miyazaki. I&#x27;m a big fan of the work by Shirow and am always looking at Adamo&#x27;s drawings and paintings&quot;.

===Structure===
&quot;Starstruck&quot; is lauded critically as a landmark advance in comics storytelling methods, recognized in retrospect for using innovations years ahead of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, which is commonly praised for them. Like its parallel descendants &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;From Hell&quot;, the series is a large mosaic of seemingly random but steadily interlocking people and events.

The series started in 1982 by eschewing the then standard superhero formula of one male character in self-contained stories, instead using an ensemble of mainly female characters in multiple entwined story threads. The original first 73 pages of serial stories covered a span of nearly three decades, on different planets, with a wide and seemingly unconnected cast, which ultimately led to everyone coming to one space station at the same time. Lee wrote in 1997: &quot;There is no reason why a story written for a comic shouldn&#x27;t be every bit as involving as the plot of a novel. It&#x27;s a wonderful form, and it can be stretched as far as creators and publishers are willing to go with it&quot;. In one sense, the series was non-linear by the sheer span of its subjects, the episodic glimpses of them in different times and places, their flashback sequences, the element of perceived randomness altering their paths, and the uncertainty of their connectedness: an uncommon narrative strategy that now draws comparisons to critically successful TV shows like &quot;Lost&quot;. In another sense, the series is a very particularly linear story - going so far as to detail the births and maturing of pivotal characters - which is too large to be seen all at once: a novelistic narrative now seen similarly in critically praised TV shows like &quot;The Wire&quot;. The writer said in 2009: &quot;When we were first published, people were used to comics with linear stories about a main character. But now, with an audience used to shows like &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;, with large casts and non-linear storylines, we&#x27;re hoping that &quot;Starstruck&quot; will find an even larger readership&quot;.

&quot;Starstruck&quot; used supplement texts as a dramatic expansion of the story. The Glossary, written by one fictional historian, went past defining references in the dialogue to sketching out the past, present, and future of the characters and their universe. Writer Alan Moore would do something similar afterward, more simply in &quot;Watchmen &quot;(1985) and much more extensively in his &quot;League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen &quot;(1999). &quot;Starstruck&quot; can be considered one of comics&#x27; premiere hypertext fictions, in the sense of using supplementary texts, adjunct stories, and ancillary art to expand, deepen, and even alter the narrative experience. Comics Journal praised this innovation in 1986: &quot;The (Space) Brigade&#x27;s origin in the Graphic Novel&#x27;s glossary section, is hilarious; in general, the &quot;Starstruck&quot; glossaries provide as much mirth as the series itself&quot;. The Comics Journal reiterated this supportive praise in 2011: &quot;&quot;Starstruck&quot;&#x27;s reputation as a confusing book unfairly implies that it is a confused book, which it emphatically is not. History, culture, family relationships, religions, vernacular speech, and all manner of written texts from this fantastic world accumulate and intersect with perfect consistency&quot;. Also praising the innovation, critic W. Andrew Shepard wrote in 2011: &quot;These sub-texts were more than winking references; they foreshadowed major events in the main narrative and, in keeping with the theme of unreliable narrators, called attention to the ways people construct histories&quot;.

The series is full of unreliable narrators who embroider the facts to suit their agenda, have their facts wrong, see only their part in events, or who miss out completely on what was important: i.e., another fictional historian is clearly fuzzy on facts that the reader has witnessed differently, though he admits it. Kaluta said they &quot;are the people we have living today, just regular people that have a way of kidding themselves about as much as they kid other people, sometimes maliciously, sometimes unknowingly&quot;. Later Lee expanded this thought: &quot;That&#x27;s something we tried to do throughout &quot;Starstruck&quot;. A character like Brucilla may exaggerate, others will outright lie and still others may be misinformed. Like life. When you&#x27;re looking through the eyes of any one character, you&#x27;ll only get a fraction of the picture&quot;. Much of the humor in &quot;Starstruck&quot;&#x27;s dialogue lies in the contradictions of their perceptions and actions, as they improvise their way through erratic situations; this has drawn comparisons to director Robert Altman, who favored loose scripts where character interaction was brought out more naturally by improvisation and the overlap of spontaneous dialogue. Critic David Allan Jones wrote of the intricacies of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; discourse: &quot;The (Robert) Altman-esque dialogue style is also a joy to parse out- as confusing and disorienting as it sometimes can be, it&#x27;s always witty and clever&quot;. The 1984 graphic novel was dedicated to Robert Altman and author Thomas Pynchon, to which Lee explained to an interviewer: &quot;If regular comics are like a Steven Spielberg movie, maybe this one is more like a Robert Altman movie&quot;. She stated her admiration of Pynchon&#x27;s complex allusive style by saying: &quot;It is dense, it is packed with images. When you&#x27;re reading Pynchon all sorts of doors open up in your brain&quot;.

The series operated on multiple levels, many of which came clear only through rereading, and with some outstanding motifs that have yet to be explained. A reading of the serials and the first six issues may give an overview, with the extras like the Glossary or the play script redefining new additional perspectives, while some deeper levels may only come into focus when the series is ultimately finished: e.g., Queen Glorianna&#x27;s hand symbols, her ultimate plan, and how the main characters fit into the eventual Great Change she intends. In this sense, &quot;Starstruck&quot; is a series that is constantly redefining itself - and the reader&#x27;s perception of it - as it continues. Lee advised in 1984: &quot;If you want to know everything that is going on, you have to look at the things in the background as well as the figures in the foreground. And just let it roll around in your mind&quot;.

Dialogue and sound effects are often used deliberately like a physical element: i.e., two androids converse in four different but simultaneous streams that overwhelm the physical space of the other characters. Elaine Lee told a Suicide Girls interview: &quot;We did include one scene in the graphic novel where Brucilla&#x27;s dialogue balloons begin to crowd Galatia off the page, in order to show that the character was a loudmouth&quot;. Award-winning letterer Todd Klein, who was starting his career when he lettered the first serials, remembers: &quot;They asked a lot from a newby letterer, and I tried hard to deliver. It was the first time I was called on to letter in a wide variety of styles, and it was good practice for (later) books like &quot;Sandman&quot;&quot;. During their work for Epic Comics, Klein recalls: &quot;There was a memorable lunch with editor Archie Goodwin and Elaine where she and I went on and on about the minutiae of the lettering while Archie just nodded, looking a bit stunned that there could be so much to say about it&quot;.

The panel layouts suggest a widescreen film in their arrangement: from the first page onward, a running layout motif of stacked page-wide rectangular panels suggests a cinematic vista, in contrast to the style of tight, multiple panel grids in average comics more similar to television&#x27;s ratio and rapid editing. By lessening use of the constrictive grid, much of the series simulates the feel of being wide open and watched from a wide view lens. This complements the story&#x27;s long view perspective while separating itself from other comics with a unique visual narrative style. Kaluta took care to give perspective panoramas of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; universe, but to fill them with functional details that ground its reality for the reader and stage its complexity: &quot;[A]nyone can walk...around inside, go around the outside, around the back, and know that there&#x27;s going to be something there&quot;.

==Themes==
===Feminism===
&quot;Starstruck&quot; is consistently lauded for its mostly female cast, the depth and range of the individual characters, and the upending of gender and sexual stereotypes through the series.
The genesis of this was practical: Elaine Lee formed her theater company as a way for women to create and perform better roles than the 1979 New York scene was offering them, and &quot;Starstruck&quot; extended this idea into the universe; she recounts: &quot;The idea was to do something really wild, so that we could all show off and do parts we would normally never be cast for. I was five feet tall and weighed about 90 pounds soaking wet, but I wanted to be an amazon starship captain, so Galatia 9 was the part I came up with for myself&quot;. At the same time, Lee was reading a lot of feminist science fiction, which she initially found liberating, but had qualms with the two common themes: the rebel women versus the &quot;&#x27;planet of chauvinist pigs&#x27; scenario...began to wear me down. If a fictional world presents you with all the same problems that greet you each day in the office, what fun is that?&quot; Conversely, the stories focusing on a blissful all-female utopia left her unmoved: &quot;My main problem with Utopian sci-fi is that nothing ever explodes, and the love scenes are really boring&quot;. With &quot;Starstruck&quot; she attempted to lift the discourse out of a dogma of revenge or exclusion into a broader spectrum where personality, skill, and fun drove the characters. In 1997 she wrote: &quot;Science fiction is at its best when it offers us new ways to look at our problems. It is silliest when it offers too many (or too little) solutions. Then it is simply an allegory...or worse, propaganda&quot;. In 2011, a critical essay from &quot;The New Inquiry&quot; lauded this approach: &quot;But Lee deliberately eschews the separatist narrative and isn&#x27;t above mocking the knee-jerk misandry which often colored those stories. Instead, our heroine is forced out into the universe at large, where she is confronted with the task of helping to build a society more congruent with her ideals&quot;.

When &quot;Starstruck&quot; moved into the sights of mainstream comics buyers during the Epic Comics run in 1985, the series had to contend with the attitudes of a predominantly young male market. Lee remembers: &quot;We got quite a reaction to the fact that there were so many female characters in the story (&quot;Is the writer a lesbian? Does she have a political agenda? Is the artist gay? Do they both hate men?&quot;). We had to wonder why everyone was so concerned about our sexuality when no one was wondering what Gilbert Hernandez and Jaime Hernandez meant by putting all those women in &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;&quot;. Lee and Kaluta were vocal advocates of &quot;Love And Rockets&quot;, an indie comics success that also earned critical notice for the breadth of its female cast: Kaluta saw it as further evidence of the mature move to escape the gender role restrictions imposed on women in comics: &quot;&quot;Love And Rockets&quot; is an incredibly adult comic strip. You can&#x27;t fault it, because the characters are real&quot;. Kaluta dismissed gender categorizers by saying of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; characters: &quot;They&#x27;re people that don&#x27;t pander to what you&#x27;re expecting a female character in a science fiction play or comic book to be, they&#x27;re just people. If you don&#x27;t like them, they&#x27;re not going to change for you&quot;.

Critic Robert Rodi, covering progressive Gay issues in comics for the &quot;Comics Journal&quot; in 1986, wrote: &quot;&quot;Starstruck&quot; is an explosion of alternate sexuality and its phenomenal trappings. Characters are (overtly or not) homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, antisexual, omnisexual - you name it, it&#x27;s there if you look for it&quot;. In multiple examples the series turns gender cliches inside out: Lee parodied the &#x27;whore&#x27; role by empowering the former pleasure droid Erotica Ann; commented on the uselessly pliant &#x27;madonna&#x27; role with the passive nuns of the Cloister Of The Goddess Uncaring; dealt with themes of sexuality that erased boundaries between genders, species, and machines; included ritualistic amazons who also like a good bacchanal; and featured a starship captain upfront who owned her sensuality and enjoyed it. The underlying themes in &quot;Starstruck&quot; regarding gender and sexuality are consistently sex-positive, anti-sexist, tolerant of sexual preference, anti-misogyny and anti-misandry, and emphasizing the individual person above any categories. In 2011, a &quot;Comics Journal&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Lee and Kaluta deserve a special award for appropriating the entire comic book tradition of women as eye candy for heterosexual male readers and setting those bodies free, throwing the reader&#x27;s desires and expectations for a loop&quot;.

In 2011, Lee said: &quot;People thought we had some political agenda, because we had a lot of female characters. Now it&#x27;s not unusual&quot;.

===Destiny===
Fate plays an underlying factor in the story: characters who feel that destiny intends greatness for them (Verloona, Bajar, Kalif); those who feel they have been cheated out of a better station (Lucrezia Bajar, Brucilla The Muscle); those that intend to manipulate fate into their own control (Queen Glorianna, Rah El Rex); those that feel fate is meaningless and anything goes (Randall Factor); and those that feel personal focus will get them through random chaos (Galatia 9, the Galactic Girl Guides).
The artist said: &quot;You have to become your own law in a way. There are self-appointed protectors of humanity, some of whom are protecting it for themselves, and some of whom have the idea that there is a better way and will stop things that are against the peoples&#x27; interests&quot;.

===Satirical intent===
&quot;Starstruck&quot; takes aim at many aspects of society.

These include religion (a science fiction author who invents a front religion with converts who passively fund a scheme of power and control, and the March Baptists who ally with corrupt corporate dictators for power); gambling (the idle rich who will gamble everything on the mere chance of someone perhaps coming into the room); vanity (a villainess who may have sacrificed many young girls just to stay youthful, and salons where hours of one&#x27;s lifespan are sold by the poor to rich patrons who want a longer life); militarism (half of Earth was disintegrated in an act of militaristic paranoia, and then covered up by a hologram, and jingoistic Space Brigades who feel the universe is only there for them to thrust their agenda and control onto); and the arts (conceptual art assassins who eliminate creators of really bad plays, and a conjoined trio of actors turning self-absorbed frilliness into high drama).

Reviewer Richard Caldwell wrote: &quot;The plot is fast-moving and puzzle-like, with strong elements of political intrigue and satire alike cavorting about the omniverse in a futuristic setting where multiple clans struggle for dominance over a mix of cultures as boggled by the theologies of the day as they are by the sensory overload of sensationalistic commercialism that passes for status quo&quot;.

&quot;Starstruck&quot; initially began its creative life as a stage play spoofing time-worn tropes of science fiction. Kaluta recalled his reaction to Lee&#x27;s script: &quot;Oh God, I was amazed at how many genres she was actually poking fun at, without being a dyed-in-the-wool science fiction fan. She was poking fun at Andre Norton, she was poking fun at everybody, all the Doc Smith stuff, without ever having read Doc Smith&quot;.

===Absurdism===
&quot;Starstruck&quot; laces its drama and intrigue with bouts of surrealistic farce, ludicrous slapstick, absurd non-sequiters, random weirdness, cross-communication, cultural parody, and one-liners.

The writer clarified: &quot;Of course, it includes some social commentary - people often comment on the feminism - but it&#x27;s all comedy. I want people to enjoy it. People accept new ideas and commentary more readily if they&#x27;re funny&quot;. Lee points to the feuding Bajar twins, Kalif and Lucrezia, whose sibling jealousy gets out of hand due to their wealth and power: &quot;In real life they probably would have just annoyed people in a bar; in comic books they blow people up&quot;. The writer saw absurdism as a philosophical antidote or survival perspective in the &quot;Starstruck&quot; universe, as well as in its creative process: &quot;We get real serious about showing the humanity of our characters, and at the same time, we feel that life is silly, and something that seems horribly embarrassing and horribly important is really silly at the same time&quot;. Critic Robert Rodi wrote: &quot;Lee has reinvented Camp as a new sensibility; it isn&#x27;t Camp in that it violates all known laws of drama and internal logic for the sake of flamboyance or effect. Rather, she&#x27;s taken the space opera form and, while respecting the limitations of physics as we know them, pushed the genre&#x27;s more baroque aspects to their absolute limits&quot;.

===Archetypes===
The series takes gender-bending liberties with many iconic female and male roles of world history and popular culture. They include the Cowgirl (the Medea women on their space ranch); Amazons (Galatia 9 and the Omegazon tribe who christened her); bimbo/sex dolls (Erotica Ann and the 333 Annie pleasure droids, and the male droid, Handi Andy); valkyries (Brucilla The Muscle, the flying warrior whose uniform makes her resemble Brunhilda); the White Queen (Queen Glorianna, the tough revolutionary posing as a shining monarch) and the Black Queen (Verloona Ti, the devourer of little children); and hardboiled detectives (Harry Palmer, the tough pug with a wounded heart).

==Merchandise and collectibles==
* Portfolio: During the first run of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; stage play in 1980, Michael Kaluta illustrated character portraits of six of the main characters. Sal Quartuccio of S. Q. Productions published these as a limited edition portfolio of 2000; the 11&quot;x14&quot; prints were in black-and-white, sealed in an envelope which Kaluta signed and numbered.
* T-shirts: In 1985, Graphitti Designs sold two &quot;Starstruck&quot; T-shirts with original art by Kaluta. One showed Erotica Ann, while the other spotlighted Erotica Ann and her lover, Harry Palmer, both with the &quot;Starstruck&quot; logo. These were offered for sale in the Epic Comics issues. In 1990, these shirt designs were amended with the &quot;Starstruck: The Expanding Universe&quot; logo, for sale in the Dark Horse issues.
* Buttons: Kaluta designed color lapel pins with individual characters for Graphitti Designs. Set 1 included Brucilla The Muscle, Galatia 9, Erotica Ann, Verloona Ti, E-V, and a faux Erotica Ann (Mary Medea). A second set with Eeeeeeeeeluh, Bronwyn of The Veil, Rah El Rex, and Kalif Bajar went unrealized.
* Convention Poster: Kaluta produced a 1990 poster for a comics convention in Grenoble, France, depicting Galactic Girl Guides playing with hand puppets of the &quot;Starstruck&quot; cast. The poster was printed in large forms on walls and billboards around the city during the convention.
* WonderCon Convention Program Book: Kaluta&#x27;s 1990 cover for the WonderCon 5 program book which depicted Galactic Girl Guides on a San Francisco cable car in Chinatown being watched over by The Shadow.
* Comic-Con Volunteer T-shirt: Volunteers who help out on all four days of San Diego Comic-Con receive &quot;a rare and extremely limited Comic-Con volunteer t-shirt that is different each year- making the shirts instant collector&#x27;s items&quot;. The souvenir T-shirt for the 1990 San Diego Comic-Con was a &quot;Starstruck&quot; shirt, printed with Kaluta&#x27;s spoof of Dave Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; featuring Brucilla The Muscle.
* Trading cards: Two sets of trading cards covering Michael Kaluta&#x27;s art career were released in the 1990s by publisher Michael Freidlander&#x27;s imprint, FPG. Series 1 (90 cards, 1994) contained 12 &quot;Starstruck&quot; cards, and Series 2 (90 cards, 1995) contained 4 &quot;Starstruck&quot; cards. An additional set of cards called Metallic Storms printed on metallic foil contained one more &quot;Starstruck&quot; card.
* &quot;Starstruck&quot; script: The script of the stage play, based on the revised 1983 production, was published in March 1985, and advertised in the Epic and Dark Horse issues.
* 2011 Merchandise: In September 2011, The AudioComics Company offered new &quot;Starstruck&quot; merchandise for sale at its online store through Zazzle.com, each using the art for the audioplay adaption: a new T-shirt, a coffee mug, and a customizable iPod Touch case. In October, a separate line of new &quot;Starstruck&quot; merchandise based on the remastered IDW series was launched, also through an online store on Zazzle.com: ten different T-shirts in various cuts, which included Brucilla And The Galactic Girl Guides, the Tri-Clone Invasion badge, Galatia And Brucilla The Muscle, The United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters emblem, the villain Verloona with Kalif and Rex, the Skate The Mirror Mission Badge, the Droid Wars Mission Patch, Kalif and the Pleasure Droids, the Bajar twins on a playing card, and the AudioPlay cover art; a coffee mug starring the heroes and another mug for the villains; a poster print of the Vercadian Protector Droid with the Aguatunesian mer-people by Kaluta, and an Aquacade poster designed from Kaluta&#x27;s original Portfolio portrait of the mermaid Eeeeeeeeeeluh with an update by painter/graphic designer Lee Moyer.

==Screen adaptations==
In 1980, Michael Kaluta told &quot;Future Life &quot;magazine: &quot;&quot;Starstruck&quot; is a big bundle of potential. It has the potential for being a film, a play, a big-budget thing; who knows what&quot;.

In various interviews Lee and Kaluta have each spoken of different plans through the 1990s to continue &quot;Starstruck&quot; on film or television, consistently emphasizing retention of copyright ownership and creative control. Kaluta said in 1993: &quot;We own the characters, and we can do whatever we want with to do with them, but when you do what you want with them, the people you do it with will want to own them. Somebody will want to come in and fool with them&quot;.

In 1990 through 1993, Kaluta worked on a project adapting the concept into movie form, but this came to naught; Kaluta noted in his career biography: &quot;For Limelight and Largo Entertainment: (1990 - 91): Character, setting, mood and toy prototypes for &#x27;The Adventures of Brucilla the Muscle, &quot;Galactic Girl Guide&quot;/Guard&#x27;, sometimes called &#x27;Maddie McPhee and the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot;&#x27; -- a movie spin-off of (&quot;Starstruck&quot;)-- in development by Pet Fly Productions for Walt Disney Productions, October 1992&quot;.

In 2000, Kaluta told to a Spanish interviewer that he hoped his &quot;Starstruck&quot; comic book will make its way to TV or film.

Lee has spoken of negotiations for a TV series circa 2003, where a network bought the option to turn &quot;Starstruck&quot; into a live action show in the spirit of &quot;Firefly&quot; or &quot;Farscape&quot;: &quot;I wrote (and was paid for) pitch documents, several scripts and I outlined a season of episodes for them. But when it finally came down to the deal, they asked us to renegotiate our contract, giving them much more control of the property than made us comfortable. We bowed out&quot;.

===&quot;Starstruck: The Audioplay&quot; (2010)===
An audio reading of the original play took place at the Henry Miller Library in Big Sur, in part to help pay the medical bills of comics legend Gene Colan, the bills stemming from his bout with liver failure in 2007 and 2008, and partly as a warm-up to a subsequent recording, launching a new &quot;Starstruck&quot; radio series.

The reading took place on August 15, 2009, with Elaine Lee and Lee Moyer in attendance, along with other comic artists from around North California and original members of the 1983 &quot;Starstruck&quot; production.

The official recording of the play occurred in May 2010, produced by the AudioComics Company; it was recorded in Portland, Maine, with a full cast and sound effects, in collaboration with WMPG radio. The role of the villainous Verloona Ti was portrayed by Denise Poirier, known for being the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. The audioplay production was made available for sale as MP3 downloads from iTunes, Amazon MP3, Amazon MP3 UK, CD Baby, ZBS, Napster, Microsoft Zune, and the AudioComics Company in October the same year. A double-disc CD was also made available through CD Baby and ZBS.

===&quot;Starstruck: Running Scared&quot; (2011)===
A second audioplay, from a new story by Elaine Lee called &quot;Running Scared&quot;, was recorded in conjunction with I-CON, on April 16, 2011, with the plan of releasing it as a free download later that year. April 16 has been a recurring date for &quot;Starstruck&quot;: the start of the 1980 play; the start of the 1983 play; and this recording. This recording returned Denise Poirier as Verloona, and marked the debut of Michael Kaluta playing a &quot;Starstruck&quot; character.

In the final issue of the IDW series, Elaine Lee alluded to other impending audioplays with &quot;all-new episodes in which Galatia, Bru, and Annie fly missions for the U4F (United Federation of Female Freedom Fighters)&quot;. This reiterated a previous interview statement where she said: &quot;We&#x27;re thinking that the new audio pieces will happen, chronologically speaking, in that space of time between end of the comic series and the events of the play, when Galatia 9, Brucilla and the reprogrammed Erotica Ann are flying missions for the U4F&quot;.

Additionally, the idea was announced of doing &quot;an all-ages series of short audio plays featuring the &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot;&quot;.

==Website==
In February 2012, an official &quot;Starstruck&quot; website was launched, designed and supervised by Elaine Lee and her son. The site announced it would post the entirety of the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; graphic novel&#x27;s pages across the span of its first year, in serialized posts three times weekly. The site also included the complete contents of the series glossary; quotes of acclaim from famous creators and journalist reviews; an historical overview of the series; and merchandise links.

==&quot;Old Proldiers Never Die&quot; (Kickstarter)==
Elaine Lee launched a Kickstarter campaign in April 2013 to raise funds to expand Harry Palmer&#x27;s story within the Starstruck story. Lee and Kaluta established a goal of $44,000 to produce a 176-page graphic novel in black and white, and a stretch goal of $69,000 for full color. The graphic novel included reprints of the Epic Comics series with expanded content, but consists mainly of new story and extras.

The Kickstarter campaign raised $67,777, and although short of the stretch goal, Lee has committed to produce the book in full color.
The graphic novel Harry Palmer: Starstruck was estimated to be delivered by spring of 2015, but the project struggled with delays. In 2017 IDW published the new &quot;Starstruck&quot; story, first in a series of six issues (February - July 2017), later that year as a one-volume graphic novel.

==Legacy==
Writer Clive Barker has stated: &quot;I was, and am, a huge fan of &quot;Starstruck&quot;, which I think was one of the most brave and elegant experiments in comic book story-telling&quot;.

Writer Mike Carey, when asked to name his favorite comic of all time, responded &quot;Starstruck&quot;, by Lee and Kaluta&quot;. He was later asked to write the introduction to the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; with his wife Lin Carey, known by her pen name as the Fantasy author, A.J. Lake (The Darkest Age series): &quot;The truth is, there just never was another book out there that did what &quot;Starstruck&quot; did&quot;. They praised the progressive innovations of the series by stating: &quot;So how cool is it that at the end of the first decade of the 21st century, it still reads as being ahead of its time?&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; opined in 2009 that &quot;the cult classic comic &quot;Starstruck&quot; [was] well ahead of its time when initially released in 1985&quot;, pointing particularly to &quot;a cast of strong female characters—a rarity in comics then and now&quot;.

After the 1984 graphic novel was published, Kaluta remembers &quot;a few letters, coming in saying: &#x27;My, this is really too clever&#x27;. The writer and artist are being very, very clever, here, obviously clever, it&#x27;s too convoluted to follow&quot;. The Epic Comics series won critical acclaim and a cult audience, but similar letters followed. Kaluta was proudest of one from an angry reader that took the creators to task for making him take longer than 15 minutes to read a comic. At the same time, the writer and artist realized they had a series that appealed to a growing segment in the mature market, but was being dismissed by the mainstream superhero audience. As a joke, Kaluta asked Epic to run an ad for Starstruck saying, &quot;Readers of The World, Unite! You Have Nothing to Use But Your Brains!&quot;, an idea they enjoyed but passed on. Addressing their concern for the future of the series, Lee said: &quot;People have called this a cult book. I hope it&#x27;s more than that. I hope people will bother to read it and go, &#x27;This is different. Let me give it a try&#x27;, rather than &#x27;This is different. Let me throw it on the other side of the room from my X-Men comics&#x27;&quot;. The Epic series was cancelled in 1986 after six issues, and in its wake within the same year, innovative series like &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, and &quot;Maus&quot; earned acclaim and success for the mature qualities and sophisticated innovations that &quot;Starstruck&quot; was initially resisted for. In the wake of the cancellation, &quot;Comics Journal&quot; critic Robert Rodi wrote: &quot;That &quot;Starstruck&quot; should owe more to &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot; than to the Galactus Trilogy means that many people who are exclusively comics-literate won&#x27;t have the necessary aesthetic vocabulary to read it. But, whose fault is that, if not their own? And whose loss is that, if not their own?&quot; In 1985, Kaluta had predicted: &quot;But they might, years later, pick up (books like Love And Rockets)...and go, &#x27;Damn it, why didn&#x27;t I read these things back then?&#x27; Because they weren&#x27;t ready for it, right? They weren&#x27;t ready to be entertained in that sphere of their life&quot;. In retrospect, book distributor and art historian Bud Plant hailed the series as &quot;an exotic, erotic, obtuse and wildly humorous space opera&quot;.

The recent 2009 IDW remastering of &quot;Starstruck&quot; has garnered critical acclaim that has bolstered its reputation as a timeless and essential work in the modern comics pantheon. Pop culture critic David Allan Jones wrote of the republished series that it would be a challenge to new readers who would &quot;have to work a little to follow along, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth it, especially if you enjoy experiencing the unique. A+&quot;. Comics reviewer Greg McElhatton wrote &quot;...it&#x27;s definitely one where a slow burn is going to pay off. &quot;Starstruck&quot; isn&#x27;t quite like anything else out there, but I think that&#x27;s part of the attraction&quot;. Joe McCullough of Comics Comics wrote: &quot;In fact, I like literally everything about this cleverly revised, nipped &amp; tucked edition, apportioning and expanding upon Lee&#x27;s modular, time-skipping vignettes with text features crammed right between the &#x27;main&#x27; story and Charles Vess-inked backup material..., creating a kind of call and response between different characters from different points in time, walking you carefully through Lee&#x27;s collage of varied femininity in a hazardous future. World (universe!) building like you don&#x27;t see so often...&quot; Alex Dueben of the Suicide Girls site found the series&#x27; progressive story and art to be timeless: &quot;Now &quot;Starstruck&quot; is a pretty nonlinear project, which I love, and I have to say that the structure and the feeling, the complexity, how it moves around, it really feels contemporary&quot;. Greg Burgas of Comic Book Resources also concurred with: &quot;It&#x27;s exciting reading something from 30 years ago and realizing how, even today, it feels ahead of its time&quot;.

The British Science Fiction Association&#x27;s journal &quot;Vector&quot; listed &quot;Starstruck&quot; among six groundbreaking comics, and praised it for &quot;...overall myth-building on a par with that of &quot;Dune&quot;...&quot; Also, much of the praise given to works like &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot; featuring &quot;...non-linear graphic storytelling, use of supplement texts for story expansion, overlapping dialogue, unreliable storytelling...&quot; employed these techniques that were pioneered by &quot;Starstruck&quot;.

Similar praise accompanied the release of the collected IDW remastered issues as the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; hardback graphic novel in 2011. Comics media critic Paul Gravett called the collection &quot;a wondrous, ebullient SF epic and it all comes together in this delectable package. Prepare to be transported!&quot; John Hilgart of The Comics Journal considered it an essential classic, advocating that readers should &quot;pick up this book, because not having read it is sort of like not having read Pogo, or listened to Trout Mask Replica, or seen a Hayao Miyazaki film&quot;. W. Andrew Shephard of The New Inquiry wrote of the collection: &quot;&quot;Starstruck&quot; could be both silly and smart, was progressive but unpretentious, and clever but not so impressed with itself that it ever forgot to entertain. IDW&#x27;s reprint of the series is a service to fans of science fiction, aficionados of comics as an art form, and anyone who loves a good story&quot;.

After the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot; softcover was released in 2012, reviewer Richard Caldwell wrote: &quot;You know how most folks peg the &quot;Watchmen&quot; as the greatest work of the sequential arts? Yea well, in comparison, this baby is far more progressive, in scope and in message, as it&#x27;s a magnum opus science fictional tale full of sound and fury, signifying everything to end all magnum opus science fictional tales full of sound and fury, signifying everything&quot;.

The Starstruck world was adapted in 2022 in a season of &quot;Dimension 20&quot;, Dropout&#x27;s TTRPG actual-play show. The show was notably created by and features Elaine Lee&#x27;s son Brennan Lee Mulligan as its gamemaster.

<text>Dhan Gopal Mukerji (; &quot;Dhan Gōpāl Mukhōpādhyāy&quot;) (6 July 1890 – 14 July 1936) was the first successful Indian man of letters in the United States and won a Newbery Medal in 1928. He studied at Duff School (now known as Scottish Church Collegiate School), and at Duff College, both within the University of Calcutta in India, at the University of Tokyo in Japan and at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University in the US.

== Biography ==

=== Early life in India ===
Dhan Gopal Mukerji was born in a Bengali Brahmin family on 6 July 1890, in a village near Calcutta on the edge of a jungle called Kajangal. His father was a lawyer who gave up his practice due to ill health and studied music instead, while also officiating as priest at the village temple. Dhan Gopal describes his childhood and adolescence in the first part (&#x27;Caste&#x27;) of his autobiography, &quot;Caste and Outcast&quot; (1923). &quot;Caste&quot; details Dhan Gopal&#x27;s induction into the Brahminical tradition of his ancestors, and his experiences of wandering for a year as an ascetic, as was the custom for boys in strict priestly households. However, disillusioned with the traditional role and impatient of the backward-looking element in strict Hindu society, he left the ascetic life to study at the University of Calcutta. Here, in the circle of his brother Jadugopal Mukherjee&#x27;s friends, he came in contact with the ideas of the Bengal resistance. Jadu Gopal was subsequently jailed without trial from 1923 to 1927. Dhan Gopal later wrote a memoir about Jadu Gopal, titled &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Face&quot;.
Dhan Gopal&#x27;s family sent him to Japan to study industrial machinery and textiles in 1910. He became deeply disillusioned by the assembly line method of production and proclivity towards sheer efficiency which he viewed as dehumanizing, degrading and debasing. He was particularly shocked by how assembly line workers who had suffered serious accidents were quickly replaced by other workers, without consideration by the factory owners or employers for either their medical recovery, health benefits or adequate compensation. After a short stay in Japan, he boarded a ship for San Francisco.

=== In the San Francisco Bay Area ===
Barely out of his teens, Dhan Gopal had absorbed enough revolutionary ideology from his peers to have been well on the way to following in his brother&#x27;s footsteps, and may not have left India entirely willingly. Dhan Gopal took his ideology with him to America where he fell in with a number of dirt-poor &#x27;anarchists&#x27; like himself. His experiences among them, in San Francisco and New York, are detailed in &#x27;Outcast&#x27;, the second section of his autobiography.

In 1910, he enrolled at University of California, Berkeley but transferred to Stanford University, where he eventually received his A.B. degree in philosophy in 1914. In San Francisco Bay Area, he looked about for a way to support himself and pay for his college education, and soon lit upon writing. Around 1916 he wrote &quot;Sandhya, Songs of Twilight&quot; and &quot;Rajani or Songs of the Night&quot;, two books of poems, and &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;, a musical play in three acts, all published by Paul Elder and Company of San Francisco.

He married Ethel Ray Dugan, an American artist and educator, and in 1918 they had a son, also called Dhan &quot;Dan&quot; Gopal Jr.

=== In New York City ===
In the 1920s, Mukerji moved to New York City and began his most prolific period of writing, published mainly by E.P. Dutton. Of his many children&#x27;s books, &quot;Kari the Elephant&quot; was the first to see publication, in 1922, followed by &quot;Hari, the Jungle Lad&quot; two years later and &quot;Gay Neck, the Story of a Pigeon&quot; in 1927. &quot;Gay&quot; was the most successful; Mukerji won the 1928 Newbery Medal from the American Library Association recognising it as the year&#x27;s best American children&#x27;s book. The story features a carrier pigeon, Gay-Neck: his training and care in the flock owned by the narrator, his drafting as a messenger for the Indian army in France during World War I, and his return to India where he and his handler deal with the wounds and memories of war in the seclusion of a lamasery. One theme is &quot;man and winged animals as brothers&quot;. Mukerji&#x27;s other children&#x27;s books include &quot;Ghond, the Hunter&quot; (1928), &quot;The Chief of the Herd&quot; (1929), &quot;Hindu Fables for Little Children&quot; (1929), &quot;Rama, the Hero of India&quot; (1930, produced for the children of Dalton School where his wife taught), &quot;The Master Monkey&quot; (1932), and &quot;Fierce-Face, the Story of a Tiger&quot; (1936). All these children&#x27;s books were published by Dutton with professional illustrations, most in about 200 pages. Many of his works were reworkings of stories he had heard as a child. Others were inspired by his own experiences in India as a child among the jungles of Bengal, or as a yogi in various holy places.

Among Mukerji&#x27;s writings for adults are &quot;A Son of Mother India Answers&quot; (1928) (partly in response to Katherine Mayo&#x27;s &quot;Mother India&quot;), &quot;Devotional Passages from the Hindu Bible&quot; and &quot;Visit India with Me&quot; (1929), &quot;Disillusioned India&quot; (1930) and &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Face&quot; (1932). &quot;The Face of Silence&quot; (1926) is about the nineteenth-century saint and visionary Ramakrishna Paramhansa and is said to have deeply influenced Romain Rolland.

The details of his later life are hazy, but there is some evidence to believe that relations with his wife entered a difficult phase at the end of his life. In spite of his many friends he felt isolated and marginalised in America, as he could do very little, beyond raising funds and entertaining visiting celebrities, to further the cause of the Indian independence movement. The choices he had made in life prevented him from ever returning permanently to India. The unhappiness of his final years drove him further into spirituality, fuelled his interest in the spiritual heritage of his motherland and gave urgency to his desire to interpret and explain India to the West.

== Death and legacy ==

On 14 July 1936, his wife discovered Mukerji had hanged himself his New York City apartment. No note was left.

Dhan Gopal Mukerji is probably the first popular Indian writer in English. He pre-dates G.V. Desani and Mulk Raj Anand by some ten or twenty years. Krupabai Satthianadhan, the woman who wrote the novels &quot;Kamala&quot; and &quot;Saguna&quot; in the late nineteenth century, was certainly an accomplished writer, but her works did not reach a mass audience until she was rediscovered in the twentieth century. Scattered writings in English by Indians are encountered throughout the nineteenth century, such as the famous &quot;Rajmohan&#x27;s Wife&quot;, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee&#x27;s first novel, written in English after the manner of Scott. There was also notable work by figures such as Roquia Sakhawat Hussain, writer of &quot;Sultana&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1905), the first science fiction piece in English by an Indian, comparable to Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Herland&quot;. But usually these are byproducts of Indian language work, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji is the first to write seriously and consistently in English.

This was not by choice, but was a product of his unfortunate situation. Dhan Gopal never lost the sense of mission which he shared with his brother, and throughout his life strove to complete the task he had set himself: to emancipate India from foreign rule and win for her culture and philosophy the respect he felt it deserved. In America he associated with fellow exiles like M.N. Roy, the founder of the Communist Party of India, to whom he is said to have suggested the adoption of the pseudonym &#x27;Manabendra&#x27;.

Forbidden the more satisfying outlet of activism, he poured his feelings into his writing. Consequently, his language is magical and persuasive, and his observation of animals and their ways is accurate and unsentimental. In his work the Gond hunter and the Brahmin child are equals in their travels in the jungle, and Dhan Gopal Mukerji never (unlike Kipling) anthropomorphises the animals or draws a facile moral from them. Although he was acutely conscious of his high caste, he saw it more as a responsibility than a privilege, and neither patronised nor denigrated the so-called lower castes and communities. He was, however, less sound on the subject of women. He writes movingly of child prostitutes in America in the 1910s and 1920s, especially of their plight during the Great Depression, but he also romanticises the life of Rangini, a &#x27;tawaif&#x27; (courtesan) encountered in &quot;Caste and Outcast&quot;. He also praises his mother&#x27;s and sisters&#x27; strict asceticism, all the more so since his mother is at that time a widow, performing all the hard penances prescribed to Hindu widows of her caste.

<text>The DUMAND Project (Deep Underwater Muon And Neutrino Detector Project) was a proposed underwater neutrino telescope to be built in the Pacific Ocean, off the shore of the island of Hawaii, five kilometers beneath the surface. It would have included thousands of strings of instruments occupying a cubic kilometer of the ocean.

The proposal called for two types of detectors: optical detectors to find the Cherenkov radiation emitted by secondary particles traveling faster than the speed of light in water, resulting from collisions by neutrinos, and hydrophones to listen for the acoustic signals generated by the interactions. Sophisticated signal processing would have combined the signals from many optical and acoustic sensors, allowing scientists to determine the direction from which the neutrino arrived, and to rule out false signals arising from other particles or acoustic sources. Because of the nature of the interaction between neutrinos and protons, DUMAND would have been most sensitive to ultra-high energy neutrinos, and completely insensitive to solar neutrinos.

Work began in about 1976, at Keahole Point, but the project cancelled in 1995 due to technical difficulties. Although it was never completed, DUMAND was in a sense a precursor of the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), and the water Cherenkov neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean (ANTARES, NEMO and the NESTOR Project). The DUMAND hardware was also donated to NESTOR, to reduce costs and cut on development and construction time.

<text>Elaine Lee is an American actress, playwright, producer, and writer, who specializes in graphic novels. She has also received recognition and awards for her work as a creator and producer of audio books and dramas.

Her comics have been illustrated by artists including Michael Wm. Kaluta, Charles Vess, James Sherman, Steve Leialoha, Linda Medley and John Ridgway.

Her graphic novel &quot;Starstruck: The Luckless, the Abandoned and Forsaked&quot; was nominated for a Jack Kirby Award as The Best Graphic Album of 1985.

She is the mother of Brennan Lee Mulligan, who is the author of &quot;Strong Female Protagonist&quot; and creator of &quot;Dimension 20&quot;.

==Career==
In 1976, she moved to New York City and found acting work. In 1979, she landed the role of Mildred Trumble on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Doctors&quot;.

She was a founding member and artistic director of Manhattan-based theatre company, Wild Hair Productions.

Wild Hair began its run performing three plays written and performed by Elaine Lee and her sister, comedian Susan Norfleet Lee: &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, &quot;The Contamination of the Kokomo Lounge&quot;, and &quot;Starstruck&quot;. &quot;Starstruck&quot;, a science-fiction spoof with a largely female cast, was performed Off-Broadway at the N.E.T.W.O.R.K. Theater, from April 16 – May 10, 1980. Lee portrayed Captain Galatia 9, and Susan Norfleet Lee played Brucilla the Muscle. In 1983, Lee directed a revised production with a new cast that was performed at the Park Royal Theater, from April 16 – May 8, 1983.

Lee&#x27;s &quot;Starstruck&quot; play grew into a comic-book series that has been adapted into audioplays and seen multiple spin-offs and sequels. It was nominated for the Jack Kirby award for Best Graphic Novel in 1985. A critic writing for the British Science Fiction Society magazine &quot;Vector&quot; called it a &quot;groundbreaking work&quot; and said its nonlinear and adjacent storytelling were like those of the later &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

Lee is a writer and co-producer for The AudioComics Company, which adapts comics and other original works into full-cast dramatizations with scores and sound effects. She adapted &quot;Locke and Key&quot;, based on IDW&#x27;s graphic novel series by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez. It was a finalist for an Audie Award. She also produced &quot;The Starling Project&quot;, which received Audie Award nominations for Original Work and Best Audio Drama, and an Earphones Award.

She co-adapted the Image Comic series &quot;The Perhapanauts&quot; which won a Silver Ogle Award, and also adapted and co-produced her &quot;Honey West: Murder on Mars&quot; (Moonstone Books) comics as an audioplay.

In 2011, Lee was chosen as an Artist in Residence at the National Audio Theatre Festival workshop. The NATF commissioned her play &quot;TransMars Tango&quot; for a live performance, starring Philip Proctor of The Firesign Theatre, and directed by Brian Price.

In comics, Lee has written a wide variety of works for Marvel, DC, Dark Horse and other publishers, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, &quot;Ragman&quot; and &quot;Vamps&quot;. Lee worked as a colorist as well, most notably on several issues of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&quot; for Marvel Comics and Dark Horse Comics and the first two issues of &quot;Starstruck&quot;. She also did color art and supervised art direction, did design work on her various &quot;Starstruck&quot; projects, such as the &quot;Starstruck Deluxe Edition&quot;, and for works on which she served as co-producer at AudioComics. She also served as Art Director for Stadium Entertainment.

<doc id="1088360" wikidata="Q1341797" url="?curid=1088360" title="2004 World Series">
<text>The 2004 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 2004 season. The 100th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals; the Red Sox swept the Cardinals in four games. The series was played from October 23 to 27, 2004, at Fenway Park and Busch Memorial Stadium, broadcast on Fox, and watched by an average of just under 25.5 million viewers. The Red Sox&#x27;s World Series championship was their first since 1918, ending the Curse of the Bambino.

The Cardinals earned their berth into the playoffs by winning the NL Central division title, and had the best win–loss record in the NL. The Red Sox won the AL wild card to earn theirs. The Cardinals reached the World Series by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the best-of-five NL Division Series and the Houston Astros in the best-of-seven NL Championship Series. The Red Sox defeated the Anaheim Angels in the AL Division Series. After trailing three games to none to the New York Yankees in the AL Championship Series, the Red Sox came back to win the series, advancing to their first World Series since . The Cardinals made their first appearance in the World Series since . With the New England Patriots winning Super Bowl XXXVIII, the World Series victory made Boston the first city to have Super Bowl and World Series championship teams in the same year (2004) since Pittsburgh in 1979. The Red Sox became the third straight wild card team to win the World Series; the Anaheim Angels won in 2002 and the Florida Marlins won in 2003.

The Red Sox had home-field advantage in the World Series by virtue of the AL winning the 2004 All-Star Game. In game one, Mark Bellhorn helped the Red Sox win with a go-ahead home run in the 8th, while starter Curt Schilling led the team to a game two victory by pitching six innings and allowing just one run. The Red Sox won the first two games despite committing four errors in each. The Red Sox won game three, aided by seven shutout innings by Pedro Martínez. A leadoff home run by Johnny Damon in the first inning gave the Sox a lead they never relinquished in game four for the Red Sox to secure the series. The Cardinals did not lead in any of the games in the series; the sixth and eighth innings of the first game was the only time that the two teams were tied. Manny Ramírez was named the series&#x27; Most Valuable Player. While not a particularly competitive series, the 2004 World Series is ranked as one of the most memorable World Series of all time, and one of the most iconic professional sports moments from the 2000s due to its historical significance for Boston. The Red Sox and Cardinals faced each other again in the 2013 World Series, which the Red Sox also won, this time 4 games to 2.

==Route to the series==
This was the ninth meeting between teams from Boston and St. Louis for a major professional sports championship. This previously happened in two World Series (1946, 1967), four NBA Finals (1957, 1958, 1960, 1961), Super Bowl XXXVI two years prior, and the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. It was also the third World Series between the Red Sox and Cardinals. The previous two meetings in 1946 and 1967 were both won by the Cardinals in seven games.

===Boston Red Sox===
The Red Sox had lost in the previous season&#x27;s ALCS against the New York Yankees. The loss was mainly blamed on the decision by then-manager Grady Little to keep starting pitcher Pedro Martínez in the game in the 8th inning of Game 7, that resulted the win (and the 2003 American League championship in general) to rival New York via a walk-off home run, then Little was fired two weeks later.
During the off-season, the Red Sox hired Terry Francona as their new manager. They also signed Keith Foulke as their closer and traded for Curt Schilling as a starting pitcher. The Red Sox played two particularly notable games against the Yankees during the regular season. A game on July 1, in which they came back from a 3-run deficit to force extra innings, is best remembered for an incident in the 12th inning, when Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter made a catch on the run before hurling himself head-first into the stands. The Yankees won the game in the next inning to take an 8-game lead in the American League East. In the 3rd inning of a game on July 24, Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo hit Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez with one of his pitches. As Rodriguez walked towards first base, he began shouting profanities at Arroyo. Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek positioned himself between the two players. After a brief argument, Varitek pushed his glove into Rodriguez&#x27; face, causing a bench-clearing brawl. The Red Sox eventually won the game thanks to a home run by Bill Mueller in the 9th inning. On July 31, the Red Sox traded shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs after he had spent eight years with the team. They acquired shortstop Orlando Cabrera and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz in this trade. They won the wild card to earn a place in the post-season for the second year in a row.

In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Red Sox faced the second-seeded Anaheim Angels in a best-of-five series. They won Game 1 largely thanks to a 7-run 4th inning, and went on to sweep the series. In the 7th inning of Game 3, with the Red Sox leading by 4, Vladimir Guerrero tied the game for the Angels with a grand slam. However, David Ortiz won the series with a game-winning home run in the 10th. In the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox lost the first three games against the top-seeded New York Yankees, including a 19–8 drubbing in Game 3, and were trailing 4–3 in Game 4 when they began the 9th inning. Kevin Millar was walked by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts then came into the game to pinch run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller then singled to enable him to tie the game. Another game-winning home run by Ortiz won the game 6–4 for the Red Sox in the 12th inning. Ortiz&#x27; single in the 14th inning of Game 5 scored the winning run for the Red Sox, in what was, then, the longest post-season game in baseball history. Despite having a dislocated ankle tendon, Schilling started Game 6 for the Red Sox. He pitched for seven innings, and allowed just one run, during which time his sock became soaked in blood. In the eighth inning, Yankees third baseman Rodriguez slapped a ball out of pitcher Arroyo&#x27;s hand, allowing the Yankees to score a run. However, after a discussion the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and canceled the run. Fans then threw debris onto the field in protest and the game was stopped for ten minutes. The Red Sox won the game 4–2 and became the first baseball team to ever force a Game 7 after having been down 3 games to none. A 10–3 win in Game 7 brought the Red Sox to the World Series for the first time in 18 years.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

Having failed to make the playoffs the season before, and with their division rivals (the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros) expected to be strong, the Cardinals were generally expected to finish 3rd in the National League Central. However, strong offensive seasons from Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, and Jim Edmonds—during which they each hit more than 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in (RBI)—helped them to lead the league in runs scored. They also allowed the fewest runs of any team in the league. Four of their starters recorded at least 15 wins and closer Jason Isringhausen recorded a league-best 47 saves. They added outfielder Larry Walker in August and finished the regular season with the best win–loss record in the league at 105-57.

The top-seeded Cardinals faced the #3 seed Los Angeles Dodgers in the divisional round of the playoffs. Five home runs in Game 1 and no runs allowed by the bullpen in Game 2 helped the Cardinals to win the first two games. A complete game by Dodgers pitcher José Lima enabled the Dodgers to force a Game 4, during which a home run by Pujols won the series for the Cardinals. In the National League Championship Series, the Cardinals faced the #4 seed Houston Astros and won the first two games in St. Louis. However, the Astros tied the series in the next two games in Houston, before a combined one-hitter by Astros pitchers Brandon Backe and Brad Lidge gave them the series lead. An RBI single by Jeff Bagwell in the 9th inning of Game 6 tied the game and forced extra innings. In the 12th, Edmonds won the game for the Cardinals with a walk-off home run. Trailing in the sixth inning of Game 7, a game-tying RBI double by Albert Pujols followed by a Scott Rolen two-run home run and then an RBI single by Larry Walker in the 8th inning helped the Cardinals to a 5–2 win and their first World Series berth in 17 years.

By reaching the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 and winning the 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate he was trying to win the team&#x27;s 10th championship.

==Series build-up==
The coming series was heavily discussed and analyzed by the American media. The &quot;Star-News&quot; of Wilmington, North Carolina, compared the Red Sox and Cardinals position by position and concluded that the Cardinals were stronger in eight positions, the Red Sox in four and both teams even in one. They predicted that the Cardinals would win the series in seven games. Andrew Haskett of E-Sports.com praised the two teams&#x27; starting pitchers but also said that the Cardinals &quot;took a serious blow&quot; when Chris Carpenter was forced out of the series due to an injury to his arm. He noted the teams&#x27; power hitters, especially the Red Sox&#x27;s David Ortiz and the Cardinals&#x27; Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds. While he praised the Red Sox defense, he called the Cardinals &quot;one of the best defensive teams to ever walk onto a baseball field&quot;. Ultimately he concluded that the series would be close and that the Red Sox would win it.

John Donovan of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; noted the team&#x27;s expected ascent to the championship, writing that they were &quot;not supposed to be here&quot;. He called the series a &quot;blast from the past&quot; because both teams were very old franchises and had twice previously met in the World Series. He wrote that the Red Sox had the edge in pitching and the Cardinals in defense and batting. He concluded that Schilling and Martinez would be the &quot;key to [the] Series&quot; and that the Red Sox would win in six games. Jim Molony of MLB.com, said he expected the series to play out differently from the last time the two teams met in the World Series in because both team offenses had been some of the best in the league during the season, while pitching had been very dominant in 1967.

Dan Shaughnessy of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said that &quot;Bally&#x27;s in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 favorites to win the Series&quot; and that there was &quot;some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected&quot;. but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein &quot;Did not want to dis[respect] the Cardinals&quot;. Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of good players in that [visitors] clubhouse over there. This isn&#x27;t the time for us to be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I&#x27;m pretty sure it will hit us.&quot; Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as it was the only way to end the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, and demeaning chants of &quot;1918!&quot; would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote that people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives hoping that they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.

Both teams had lost in their previous World Series appearances in seven games. The Red Sox lost to the New York Mets in , while the Cardinals lost in to the Minnesota Twins. The Cardinals and Red Sox had not won the World Series since and respectively. When the two teams had previously played each other in the and 1967 World Series, the Cardinals won both series in seven games. Having won the All-Star Game, the AL had been awarded home-field advantage, which meant the Red Sox had the advantage at Fenway Park in four of the seven games in the series.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

Local band Dropkick Murphys performed &quot;Tessie&quot;, and a moment of silence was observed to remember local student Victoria Snelgrove, who had been accidentally killed by police two days earlier as Sox fans had celebrated winning the American League pennant. Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, another local band, performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski threw the ceremonial first pitch. Kelly Clarkson sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.
Tim Wakefield made his first start of the 2004 postseason for the Red Sox, becoming the first knuckleball pitcher to make a World Series start since 1948, while Woody Williams, who had won his previous two starts in the post-season, was the Cardinals&#x27; starting pitcher. In the bottom of the first inning, Williams gave up a lead-off double to Johnny Damon, and then hit Orlando Cabrera in the shoulder with one of his pitches. After Manny Ramírez flied out, Ortiz hit a three-run home run in his first-ever World Series at bat. Kevin Millar then scored by virtue of a single by Bill Mueller to put the Red Sox up 4–0.

The Cardinals scored one run in the second on a sacrifice fly by Mike Matheny to score Jim Edmonds, then one in the third innings on a solo home run to right field by Walker. In the bottom of the third, the Red Sox scored three runs after seven consecutive batters reached base, giving them a five-run lead. Dan Haren came in from the Cardinals&#x27; bullpen to replace Williams during the inning.

In the top of the fourth inning, Bronson Arroyo was brought in to replace Wakefield after he had walked four batters. Those walks, combined with a throwing error by Millar and a passed ball by Doug Mirabelli, allowed the Cardinals to reduce the lead to two runs. In the sixth inning, So Taguchi reached first on an infield hit and was allowed to advance to second when Arroyo threw the ball into the stands. Doubles by Édgar Rentería and Walker tied the game at seven. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Ramírez singled with two men on base, and a poor throw by Edmonds allowed Mark Bellhorn to score. Ortiz then hit a line drive that appeared to skip off the lip of the infield and hit Cardinals&#x27; second baseman Tony Womack with &quot;considerable force&quot;. Womack immediately grabbed his clavicle as a second Red Sox run scored. He was attended to once play had ended and replaced by Marlon Anderson. A precautionary X-ray revealed that there was no damage.

In the top of the eighth inning, with one out and two men on base, Red Sox closer Keith Foulke came in to pitch. Rentería singled towards Ramírez in left field, who unintentionally kicked the ball away, allowing Jason Marquis to score. Walker also hit the ball towards Ramírez in the next at bat. Ramírez slid in an attempt to try to catch the ball, but tripped and deflected the ball for his second error in two plays, and the fourth Red Sox error in the game. Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky&#x27;s Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead. In the ninth inning, Foulke struck out Cedeño to win the game for the Red Sox 11–9.

With a total of 20 runs, it was the highest-scoring opening game of a World Series ever. With four RBI, Ortiz also tied a franchise record for RBI in a World Series game. Walker, making his World Series debut in Game 1, collected four hits in five at bats with a home run and two doubles. His four-hit outing tied a Cardinals World Series record, becoming the seventh overall and first to do so since Lou Brock in 1967, also against Boston.

===Game 2===
Boston native James Taylor performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before Game 2 and singer Donna Summer, also a Boston native, performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by the surviving three members of the famous Red Sox quartet that had faced the Cardinals in 1946: Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky (Ted Williams had died two years earlier).
Despite having a torn tendon in his right ankle, similar to Game 6 of the ALCS against the Yankees, Schilling started Game 2 for the Red Sox. Schilling had four stitches in the ankle the day before, causing him &quot;considerable discomfort&quot;. He was not sure on the morning of Game 2 if he would be able to play, but after one of the stitches was removed, he was treated with antibiotics and was able to pitch.
Morris started for the Cardinals on three days&#x27; rest (one day fewer than is orthodox rest for a starting pitcher).

In the first inning, Albert Pujols doubled with two out, and Scott Rolen hit a line drive towards Mueller, who caught it to end the inning. Morris walked Ramírez and Ortiz in the bottom of the inning. Varitek then tripled to center field to give the Red Sox a 2–0 lead.

In the fourth inning, Pujols doubled again and was able to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored in the bottom of the inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the previous four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.

After six innings of allowing no earned runs – which gave him a total of 13 innings against the Yankees and Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which a sacrifice fly by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.

With the win, Schilling became only the fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series game with a team from both leagues, having previously done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much of the blame for the Cardinals&#x27; losses in the first two games was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals&#x27; best batters, had combined for one hit in 22 at-bats.

===Game 3===
Seattle Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martínez was presented with the 2004 Roberto Clemente Award, having announced his retirement one month before. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by arguably the Cardinals&#x27; best-ever position player, Stan Musial, and caught by arguably their best-ever pitcher, Bob Gibson. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;God Bless America&quot; were sung by country music singer Martina McBride and singer–songwriter Amy Grant respectively. During the game, a sign for the fast-food restaurant Taco Bell that measured and read &quot;Free Taco Here&quot;, was hung approximately from home plate, over the left-center field bullpen. Taco Bell promised that, if the sign was hit by a home run ball, they would give a free &quot;Crunchy Beef Taco&quot; to everyone in the United States.

Once again, the Red Sox took the lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Pedro Martínez was the starting pitcher for the Red Sox, and in the bottom of the first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.

In the bottom of the third inning, the Cardinals had two runners on base with no one out. Walker hit a ground ball towards first base, and Cardinals third base coach José Oquendo signalled to Suppan on third to run to home plate. However, halfway towards home, Suppan &quot;suddenly stopped&quot;. Édgar Rentería, who had been running from second base towards third, was forced to return to second when he saw Suppan had stopped. After stepping on first base, David Ortiz began moving toward Suppan, who had turned back toward third, Ortiz threw to third baseman Mueller, who tagged Suppan out. After the next batter, Albert Pujols, grounded to Mueller, the inning ended.

Trot Nixon extended the Red Sox lead to two in the top of the fourth, hitting a single to right field that scored Mueller, who had started the rally with a two-out double to left-center. Johnny Damon then led off the Red Sox&#x27;s fifth inning with a double to right. Singles by Orlando Cabrera and Ramírez, to right and left respectively, scored Damon to make it 3–0. With two out, Mueller singled along the first base line, enabling Cabrera to score the Red Sox&#x27;s fourth run. Suppan was replaced by Al Reyes, which meant none of the Cardinals three starting pitchers had finished five innings during the series.

Mike Timlin relieved Martinez in the bottom of the eighth inning. He finished with six strikeouts, three hits allowed and retired the last 14 batters he faced. The Cardinals avoided a shutout when Walker hit a home run to center field off Foulke in the ninth inning, but Foulke retired the other three batters he faced in the inning to secure the win for the Red Sox 4–1.

On the same day the Red Sox won Game 3, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;&#x27;s Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the Red Sox on the verge of winning a World Series, he wondered how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox and hoping that one day, they would see the Red Sox win a World Series.

===Game 4===

Country music singer Gretchen Wilson, a lifelong Cardinals fan, performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Creed lead singer Scott Stapp sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch. Barry Bonds and Manny Ramírez received the Hank Aaron Award for the National and American Leagues, respectively. Former Cardinals players Lou Brock and Red Schoendienst threw out ceremonial first pitches along with Rashima Manning, from the Herbert Hoover Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. A lunar eclipse was visible during the game – the first lunar eclipse to take place during a World Series game. The game was also played on the 18th anniversary of Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, which the Red Sox had lost at Shea Stadium to the New York Mets, despite taking a 3–0 lead into the sixth inning.

Damon hit a home run to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2–1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth straight game; it proved to be the game-winning run. Ramírez singled in the third inning to give him a hit in 17 consecutive postseason games. Doubles to right by David Ortiz and to center by Trot Nixon, who narrowly missed a grand slam after swinging on a 3–0 count, scored two more runs for the Red Sox to give them a three-run lead. Cardinals starter Jason Marquis went six innings and allowed just the three runs. Marquis was the only Cardinal pitcher who went past five innings, but would be saddled with the loss with no run support.

In the top of the eighth, Mueller led off with a single to right and Nixon followed with his third double of the game. Jason Isringhausen came in to pitch for the Cardinals with the bases loaded and nobody out, and was able to finish the inning without allowing a run to score. Kevin Millar pinch hit for the Red Sox starting pitcher Derek Lowe during this inning. It was the third straight game in which the Red Sox starting pitcher had not allowed an earned run.

Red Sox closer Foulke came in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke&#x27;s legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a fly out and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder&#x27;s indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and the Red Sox drought.

The series win was the Red Sox&#x27;s first title in 86 years. They were also the fourth team to win a World Series without trailing in any of the games in the series, and the seventh to win it having previously been three outs away from elimination. With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000 Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in curses, I believe you make your own destination. &quot; Kevin Millar said that it was important to finish off the Cardinals in four and not let it go to a fifth game given the team&#x27;s history.

The Cardinals offense struggled to find spark in the final three games. Pujols, Rolen, and Edmonds, the normally fearsome 3-4-5 hitters for the Cardinals, were six-for-45 with one RBI. The club batted .190 with a .562 OPS overall. Walker was one of very few exceptions, batting .357 with a 1.366 OPS. His two home runs accounted for the only two home runs hit by the entire Cardinals team. In the 2004 postseason, Walker scored 21 percent (14 of 68) of Cardinal runs.

==Broadcasting==
The series was broadcast by Fox, and the announcers were Joe Buck and Tim McCarver. Jeanne Zelasko covered the pre-game build up to all four games and the presentation of the World Series trophy.
An average of 23.1 million people watched Game 1. This was the highest television ratings for the opening game of a World Series in five years and had the highest average number of viewers since 1996. It was also the highest rated broadcast on any network in the past ten months. The ratings for the first two games were also the highest average since 1996, and the average for the first three games was the highest since 1999. Game 3 had the highest average number of viewers with 24.4 million, since 1996 when 28.7 million watched the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. It was also the Fox network&#x27;s highest rating for a Game 3 of a World Series ever. Game 4 posted an 18.2 national rating giving the series an overall average of 15.8. This was the highest average in five years, and the average number of viewers of 25.4 million was the highest since 1995.

In terms of local radio, Joe Castiglione and Jerry Trupiano called the series for WEEI in Boston while Mike Shannon and Wayne Hagin announced for KMOX in St. Louis.

==Aftermath==
With the win coming eight months after the New England Patriots victory in Super Bowl XXXVIII, the event made Boston the first city to have a Super Bowl and World Series winner in the same year since Pittsburgh in 1979. A number of players from both teams won awards for their performances during the season. Manny Ramírez won the Hank Aaron Award and, along with Albert Pujols, a Silver Slugger Award, while Gold Glove awards were won by Mike Matheny, Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds. The American sports magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; honored the Red Sox with their Sportsman of the Year award a month later, making them the first professional team to ever win the award. For pitcher Curt Schilling, it was the second time he had won the award, having shared it with then-Arizona Diamondbacks teammate Randy Johnson in 2001.

This World Series win by the Red Sox continued a history of Boston teams beating St. Louis teams to win championships. Previously, in Super Bowl XXXVI, the New England Patriots had upset the St. Louis Rams&#x27; &quot;Greatest Show on Turf&quot; to win their first Super Bowl and herald a dynasty led by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, the Boston Bruins had swept the St. Louis Blues in the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals (with Game 4 being remembered for Bobby Orr&#x27;s Cup-winning overtime goal that sent him flying), and the Boston Celtics (as led by Bill Russell) met the St. Louis Hawks four times from 1957 to 1961 for the NBA championship and won three times, which included the first in a dynasty in . With championship showdowns between teams from Boston and St. Louis seen in Major League Baseball, the NFL, NBA and NHL, it is the only showdown between teams from two specific locations, that has been seen in each of these four leagues. St. Louis would finally end Boston&#x27;s dominance against them when the St. Louis Blues defeated the Boston Bruins in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Red Sox===
The Red Sox&#x27;s win in the World Series ended the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, which supposedly had afflicted the team ever since the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1919. Pitcher Derek Lowe and other players said that the team would no longer hear &quot;1918!&quot; at Yankee Stadium ever again. Kevin Millar said to all Red Sox fans: &quot;We wanted to do it so bad for the city of Boston. To win a World Series with this on our chests, it hasn&#x27;t been done since 1918. So rip up those &#x27;1918!&#x27; posters right now.&quot; Members of previous Red Sox teams who had fallen short immediately acclaimed the 2004 team, including Pesky – who had been the shortstop responsible for a fatal checking error that had allowed the Cardinals&#x27; Enos Slaughter to complete his &quot;Mad Dash&quot; to score the winning run in Game 7 at the old Sportsman&#x27;s Park in 1946. Pesky watched the game from the visiting clubhouse and was immediately embraced by Millar, Wakefield, Schilling and others as a living representative of those previous teams as he joined the celebrations.

It also added to the recent success of Boston-area teams, following the Patriots wins in Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVIII. With the Patriots having won Super Bowl XXXVIII the previous February, the Red Sox winning the World Series marked the first time since 1979 that the same city had a Super Bowl and World Series winner in the same year – the last city to accomplish the feat had been Pittsburgh, when the Steelers and Pirates had won Super Bowl XIII and the World Series respectively. The city would go on to record a decade of sports success from 2001 to 2011 with seven championships in the four major North American sports leagues (MLB, the NFL, the NBA and the NHL), including one in each league after the Patriots won two more Super Bowls, the Celtics won the 2008 NBA championship and the Bruins won the Stanley Cup in 2011. Following the Bruins winning the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columnist Dan Shaughnessy ranked all seven championships and chose the Red Sox&#x27; 2004 World Series win as the greatest Boston sports championship during the ten-year span.

Red Sox Manager Terry Francona became the third manager in four years to win a World Series in his first year as manager, following Bob Brenly of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks and Jack McKeon of the 2003 Florida Marlins.

Massachusetts US Senator, Boston resident and future Secretary of State John Kerry, who had been named Democratic presidential nominee in Boston that summer, wore a Red Sox cap the day after the series ended. He also said that the Red Sox had &quot;[come] back against all odds and showed America what heart is&quot;. His Republican opponent, incumbent President George W. Bush, made a phone call from the White House to congratulate the team&#x27;s owner John W. Henry, president Larry Lucchino and manager Terry Francona. The team also visited Bush at the White House the following March, where he gave a speech honoring their presence, in which he asked &quot;what took [them] so long?&quot; A future Presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, at the time Massachusetts Governor, ceremonially helped remove the Reverse Curve road sign on Storrow Drive that had been famously spray-painted to read &quot;Reverse the Curse&quot; as a further marking of the end of the Curse.

The day after the Red Sox win, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; more than doubled its daily press run, from 500,000 to 1.2 million copies, with the headline, &quot;YES!!!&quot; right across the front page.
The Red Sox held their World Series victory parade on the following Saturday, October 30. The team was transported around on 17 duck boats equipped with loudspeakers so the players could talk to the spectators. Due to large interest in the parade, it was lengthened by officials the day before to include the Charles River, so that fans could watch from the Boston and Cambridge river banks. The parade did not however, include a staged rally. The parade began at 10 a.m. local time at Fenway Park, turned east onto Boylston Street, then west onto Tremont Street and Storrow Drive before entering the river. One of the lanes on Massachusetts Avenue had to be closed to accommodate members of the media filming the parade as it passed under the Harvard Bridge. Ramírez was handed a sign by one of the spectators part of the way through the parade, which read, &quot;Jeter is playing golf today. This is better!&quot; He held on to this sign for the rest of the parade, in a similar way to what Tug McGraw said after the Philadelphia Phillies won the 1980 World Series. Over three million people were estimated to have attended the parade, making it the largest gathering ever in the city of Boston.
The Red Sox were presented with their World Series rings on April 11, 2005, at a ceremony before the team&#x27;s first home game of the 2005 season. Former Red Sox players Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, Johnny Pesky, and Carl Yastrzemski were all present, as were the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Boston Pops Orchestra. During the ceremony, five red pennants were first unfurled at the top of the Green Monster, showing the years of each of the Red Sox&#x27; previous World Series wins. A much larger banner was unfurled that covered the entire wall and read &quot;2004 World Series Champions&quot;. James Taylor, himself a Boston native and a Red Sox fan, performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, and 19 members of the United States Army and Marine Corps who had fought in the Iraq War walked onto the field. Moments of silence were held to honor the deaths of Pope John Paul II, who had died nine days earlier, and former Red Sox relief pitcher, Dick Radatz. The rings were handed out by the team&#x27;s owner, John W. Henry. Former Red Sox players Lowe and Dave Roberts, who had joined the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres respectively during the off-season, were also present to collect their rings. The ceremony, which lasted around an hour, ended with stars from other Boston sports teams, including the Celtics&#x27; Bill Russell, the Bruins&#x27; Bobby Orr and the Patriots&#x27; Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour, throwing ceremonial first pitches. The presence of Bruschi and Seymour made evident the recent success of Boston-area teams. The day after the Red Sox won the Series, Shaughnessy and the rest of the news media said of the Red Sox home opener: &quot;The team in the third-base dugout? The New York Yankees, Sweet.&quot; In a sign of respect, the Red Sox rivals came to the top step of the visitors dugout and gave the Red Sox a standing ovation. The Fenway Park crowd burst into cheers when Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera was introduced, breaking from the tradition of fans booing opposing players, due to him having blown save opportunities in Games 4 and 5 of the 2004 ALCS. Rivera was a good sport about it and laughed while waving his arms in mock appreciation of the fans.
The following August, Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;Faithful&quot;, a book which collected e-mails about the Red Sox between American writers and Red Sox fans Stephen King and Stewart O&#x27;Nan during the 2004 season. In March 2005, Houghton Mifflin Company published &quot;Reversing the Curse&quot;, a book by Shaughnessy, author of the bestselling &quot;The Curse of the Bambino&quot;, chronicling the 2004 Red Sox season. ESPN&#x27;s Bill Simmons published &quot;Now I Can Die In Peace&quot;, a collection of his columns with updated annotations and notes, including columns for each of the last four games of the ALCS and each World Series game – with Game 4 being a running diary. The Farrelly Brothers altered the ending of their 2005 film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; – which includes appearances by Damon, Nixon and Varitek – to coincide with the actual end of the series. They and their crew, plus stars Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, flew to St. Louis and Barrymore and Fallon attended Game 4 in character, complete with the two of them running onto the field at Busch Stadium and kissing once the final out was made.

On May 28, 2014, the team reunited at Fenway Park as the Red Sox celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the historic championship as they hosted the Atlanta Braves. Ramirez threw out the first pitch to Varitek but was cut off by Damon in a reversal of Ramirez once cutting off Damon&#x27;s throw from center field during a game.

On April 9, 2024, the team reunited again for their 20-year anniversary of the 2004 championship as the Red Sox hosted the Baltimore Orioles on Opening Day at Fenway Park. The pregame ceremony was also in memory of Wakefield, who had died of brain cancer on October 1st at the age of 57, Wakefield&#x27;s wife Stacy, who had died of pancreatic cancer on February 29th at the age of 53, and Lucchino, who had died of heart failure on April 2nd at the age of 78. Tim and Stacy&#x27;s children – their son Trevor and daughter Brianna – led the 2004 team in from left field, and Brianna threw the ceremonial first pitch to Varitek.

===Cardinals===

On the Cardinals&#x27; side, the media expressed disappointment at the team&#x27;s failure to win a game in the Series after recording the team&#x27;s best regular season in over 60 years. Many reporters believed that the Cardinals had not played up to their usual standard, and much of the blame was directed at Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals&#x27; best hitters, who had combined for one hit in 39 at bats in the series.

It also marked the last time that Busch Memorial Stadium would host a World Series. The Cardinals moved to the new Busch Stadium in their championship season of , which was their first since .

===2005 season and beyond===
Both the Red Sox and Cardinals made the playoffs the following season. The Red Sox lost to the eventual champions the Chicago White Sox, in the American League Division Series, who would go on to end their own curse in the Curse of the Black Sox. The Cardinals, in a repeat meeting of the previous season&#x27;s National League Championship Series, lost to the Houston Astros. However, the city of Boston would see more success when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX, three months after the Red Sox won the World Series, giving the greater Boston area its third championship in 12 months, making it the first time since 1980 that any city had two Super Bowl winners and a World Series winner in a period of the same length.

Both teams also won one of the next three World Series in successive years; the Cardinals, as noted above, in , beating the Detroit Tigers in five games, becoming the first team since the New York Yankees in , to win a World Series championship in their first season in a new stadium (which the Yankees themselves would also do in ). Tony La Russa would achieve the distinction that he could not achieve in 2004 of managing World Series winners in both leagues. He would continue to wear number 10 to pay tribute to Sparky Anderson afterwards. 

The Red Sox won the World Series the following year, sweeping the Colorado Rockies in four games. Tom Werner, chairman of the Red Sox, and team president Larry Lucchino said that the 2004 championship was &quot;for the parents and grandparents who had suffered through the Curse of the Bambino&quot;, while 2007 was &quot;for children, grandchildren, and for Red Sox Nation&quot;.

Both teams would meet again in the 2013 World Series, with the Red Sox winning the championship in six games. It was the first time Boston clinched the World Series at its home field, Fenway Park, since 1918. Boston would win an additional title in when they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4 games to 1.

Twelve years after this World Series, the Chicago Cubs would end their own championship drought at 108 years, defeating the Cleveland Indians in seven games in their first World Series appearance in 71 years. In doing this, Theo Epstein is now credited with helping to end two of the most famous curses in all of professional sports. Coincidentally, the losing manager in that year&#x27;s World Series was Terry Francona, who had managed the Red Sox to both the 2004 and 2007 championships. The winning manager in that World Series, Joe Maddon, like La Russa, managed pennant winning teams in both leagues having managed the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays.

In the 2021 National League Division Series, 2004 Red Sox members faced off against each other as managers, as Dave Roberts&#x27; Los Angeles Dodgers beat Gabe Kapler&#x27;s San Francisco Giants in five games.

<doc id="1088362" wikidata="Q860913" url="?curid=1088362" title="Bobonaro Municipality">
<text>Bobonaro (, , or ) is a municipality (and was formerly a district) in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste commonly known as East Timor. It is the second-most western municipality on the east half of the island. It has a population of 92,045 (Census 2010) and an area of 1,376 km2.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Bobonaro&quot; is said to be a Portuguese approximation of the Tetum language word &quot;Buburnaru&quot;, which means &#x27;tall eucalypt&#x27;. However, there are also other explanations for the origin of the municipality&#x27;s name. 

&quot;Ho&quot; () and &quot;nalu&quot;, the name of a traditional woven basket also called a &#x27;bote&#x27; or a &#x27;taan&#x27;, are words in the local Bunak language. The basket is worn on the back with a strap on the forehead. In combination, &quot;ho&quot; and &quot;nalu&quot; mean &#x27;basket of blood&#x27; or &#x27;basket of life&#x27;, and &quot;Bobonaro&quot; approximates the combination.

Additionally, the combination of the words &quot;bobo&quot; () and &quot;naru&quot; () in another local language, Kemak, refer to a safe place where one can hide for a long time.

==Geography==
The Savu Sea lies to the north of Bobonaro. The municipality borders the municipalities of Liquiçá to the northeast, Ermera to the east, Ainaro to the southeast, and Cova-Lima to the south. To the west lies the Indonesian province Nusa Tenggara Timur. In Portuguese Timor, the then district had the same boundaries as the present municipality; however its capital was at Vila Armindo Monteiro, which is now called Bobonaro.

The capital of Bobonaro is East Timor&#x27;s fourth largest city, Maliana. it had a population of 13,200. It sits at 9.00°S and 125.22°E, 149 km from to the southwest of the national capital, Dili. The next two largest cities in the municipality are Bobonaro City (also known as Aubá), with 6,700 people; and Lolotoi with a population of 3,800. Another village is Atabae in Atabae Administrative Post.

==Administrative posts==
The municipality&#x27;s administrative posts (formerly sub-districts) are:
*Atabae
*Balibo
*Bobonaro
*Cailaco
*Lolotoe (also spelled Lolotoi); and
*Maliana.

The administrative posts are divided into 50 sucos (&quot;villages&quot;) in total.

==Infrastructure==
The main road between Dili and the Indonesian border at Batugade runs through this municipality, clinging closely to the coast for almost its entire length through the municipality. It runs through Atabae and Balibó administrative posts.

===Border crossings===
The main border crossing between East Timor and Indonesia is located in this district at Batugade where the East Timor Immigration Post is located. The Indonesian checkpoint is located in Mota&#x27;ain in Belu Regency, Nusa Tenggara Timur Province. Another minor border crossing checkpoint is maintained by the Immigration Service of East Timor within this municipality at Tunibibi near Maliana. The Indonesian post for this crossing is at Turiskain, also in Belu Regency.

==History==
The municipality had been a popular destination in Timor, due to its mountains and hot springs, but it suffered much violence in the war for independence. Balibó, located about 10 miles from the Indonesian border, was estimated by Human Rights Watch to be 70% destroyed during the militia violence that preceded the referendum for East Timorese independence. It was also the site of the killing of five Australian-based journalists (the Balibo Five) by Indonesian forces on 16 October 1975 during an incursion by Indonesia into what was then Portuguese Timor.

On 29 May 2001, former members of Dadaras Merah Putih who had become indebted to a cross border gambling ring in Maubusa, in retaliation they threw around four grenades over the Loes River from the Indonesian side towards the market in the East Timorese side killing five, one of the leaders of the gambling ring were killed, but the other four were uninvolved, over 40 others were wounded in the attack. Their bodies were taken to the Indonesian side, and have yet to be identified with the exception of 20-year-old Rosina Olaloco.
==Demographics==
In addition to the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese, a large part of Bobonaro speaks the Malayo-Polynesian languages Bekais and Kemak and Papuan language Bunak, which are designated &quot;national languages&quot; by the constitution.

<text>Tolnaftate (INN), sold under the brand name TAGRID, among others, is a synthetic thiocarbamate used as an anti-fungal agent that may be sold without medical prescription in most jurisdictions. It is supplied as a cream, powder, spray, liquid, and liquid aerosol. Tolnaftate is used to treat fungal conditions such as jock itch, athlete&#x27;s foot and ringworm.

==Mechanism==
Although the exact mechanism of action is not entirely known, it is believed to inhibit squalene epoxidase, an important enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol (a key component of the fungal cell membrane) in a similar way to terbinafine.

==Uses==
Tolnaftate has been found to be generally slightly less effective than azoles when used to treat tinea pedis (athlete&#x27;s foot). It is, however, useful when dealing with ringworm, especially when passed from pets to humans.

== Side effects ==
Side effects that may occur include:
* allergic reactions like:
** skin rash
** itching or hives
** swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
* inflammation, redness, or pain at the affected area
Less severe side effects include:
* dry skin
* mild skin irritation, burning, or itching at the affected area

<text>The Goddess movement is a revivalistic Neopagan religious movement which includes spiritual beliefs and practices that emerged primarily in the United States in the late 1960s (Feraferia is one of the earliest) and predominantly in the Western world during the 1970s. The movement grew as a reaction both against Abrahamic religions, which exclusively have gods who are referred to using masculine grammatical articles and pronouns, and secularism. It revolves around Goddess worship and the veneration for the divine feminine, and may include a focus on women or on one or more understandings of gender or femininity.

The Goddess movement is a widespread non-centralized trend in modern Paganism, and it therefore has no centralized tenets of belief. Beliefs and practices vary widely among Goddess worshippers, from the name and the number of goddesses worshipped to the specific rituals and rites that are used. Some, such as Dianic Wicca, exclusively worship female deities, but others do not. Belief systems range from monotheistic to polytheistic to pantheistic, and encompass a range of theological variety similar to that in the broader Neopagan community. Common pluralistic belief means that a self-identified Goddess worshipper could theoretically worship any number of different female deities from various cultures and religions all over the world. Based on its characteristics, the Goddess movement is also referred to as a form of cultural religiosity that is increasingly diverse, geographically widespread, eclectic, and more dynamic in process.

The estimated population of the movement is only in the U.S. 500,000 and in the U.K. 120,000.

== Background and precursors ==

In the 19th century, some first-wave feminists such as Matilda Joslyn Gage and Elizabeth Cady Stanton published their ideas describing a female deity, whilst anthropologists such as Johann Jakob Bachofen examined the ideas of prehistoric matriarchal Goddess cultures in the Mediterranean region. There are also post-traditional Goddess feminists who claim that female theologies are more ancient, having emerged in and around Prehistoric Europe during the Upper Paleolithic period or 30,000 years ago: the Great Goddess hypothesis. It is said that these theologies were suppressed in the west when Christianity outlawed all pre-Christian religions through a series of edicts by Theodosius I. These ideas gained additional traction during the second-wave feminism movement. In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists who became interested in the history of religion also refer to the work of Helen Diner (1965), whose book &quot;Mothers and Amazons: An Outline of Female Empires&quot; was first published in German in 1932; Mary Esther Harding (1935), the first significant Jungian psychoanalyst in the United States; Elizabeth Gould Davis (1971); and Merlin Stone (1976).

Since the 1970s, Goddess Spirituality has emerged as a recognizable international cultural movement. In 1978 Carol P. Christ&#x27;s widely reprinted essay &quot;Why Women Need the Goddess,&quot; which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess, was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the &quot;Great Goddess Re-emerging&quot; conference at the University of California, Santa Cruz; it was first published in &quot;The Great Goddess Issue&quot; of &quot;&quot; (1978). Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies &quot;Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality&quot; (1989) and &quot;Womanspirit Rising&quot; (1979/1989); the latter included her essay &quot;Why Women Need the Goddess.&quot;

From 1974 to 1984, &quot;WomanSpirit&quot;, a journal edited in Oregon by Jean and Ruth Mountaingrove, published articles, poetry, and rituals by women, exploring ideas and feelings about female deity. The journal &quot;The Beltane Papers&quot;, which started publication at about the same time, continued until mid-2011. The Goddess movement has found voice in various films and self-published media, such as the &quot;Women and Spirituality&quot; trilogy made by Donna Read for the National Film Board of Canada.

===Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow===
Maria de Naglowska, a Russian émigré in France, established and led a short-living occult, sexual magical and Satanic society known as the Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow () in Paris from 1932 to 1935. Naglowska&#x27;s occult teaching centered on what she called the &quot;Third Term of the Trinity&quot;, in which the Holy Spirit of the classic Christian trinity is recognized as the divine feminine.

===Church of Aphrodite===

One of the earliest precursor to the contemporary Goddess movement was the Church of Aphrodite, a religious organization founded and registered in 1938 by male feminist Gleb Botkin, first in West Hempstead, New York and later in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Monotheistic church believes in a singular female goddess, who is named after the ancient Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. The relationship between the Goddess Aphrodite and the visible world may be illustrated by that between a mother and her child, and the creation of the world was like a woman giving birth. The church did not continue long after Botkin&#x27;s death in 1969, some of his followers went on to join new neopagan movements.

== Terminology ==
Associated terms sometimes used within the movement include the following:

*Goddesses refers to a local or specific deity linked clearly to a particular culture and often to particular aspects, attributes and powers (for example: the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna/Ishtar; Athena; or Hindu goddesses like Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, poetry, music, inspiration and wisdom; and Lakshmi goddess of wealth and sovereignty).
*The Goddess or the Great Goddess is a female deity that is regarded as primary. Such a religious system existed historically in many cultures, though not under the same names and not necessarily with the same traits. If there is a male god, he is often seen as her equal, or his powers may be seen as deriving from her. These terms are &quot;not&quot; usually understood to refer a single deity that is identical across cultures but rather a concept common in many ancient cultures, which those in the Goddess movement want to restore. When Goddess is spoken of as a personal guardian, as in &#x27;my Goddess&#x27; it means &#x27;my worldview in Goddess spirituality.&#x27;
*Goddess Spirituality is sometimes used as a synonym for Goddess Movement and sometimes as the spiritual practice that is part of the Goddess movement. It could also refer to the Goddess Movement&#x27;s ethos, particularly when used to construct Christianity as the diametrical opposite of the Goddess. Here, the term becomes a distinguishing concept that sets the movement apart from Christianity with little room for overlap.
*Goddessing is a recent contribution to Goddess vocabulary, possibly derived from the British journal of the same name, following from Mary Daly&#x27;s suggestion that deity is too dynamic, too much in process and changing continually, to be a noun, and should better be spoken as a verb (Daly 1973). Goddessing may also mean Goddess culture, Goddess way of life, Goddess practice, or &#x27;my goddessing&#x27; as in my individual interpretation and experience of Goddess.
*Priestess refers to women who dedicate themselves to one or more goddesses. It may or may not include leadership of a group, and it may or may not include legal ordination. The analogous term for men is &quot;priest.&quot; However, not everyone who dedicates themselves to the Goddess or goddesses calls themselves a priestess (or priest).
*Thealogy is a term whose first use in the context of feminist analysis of religion and discussion of Goddess is usually credited to Naomi Goldenberg, who used the term in her book &quot;Changing of the Gods&quot;. It substitutes the Greek feminine prefix &quot;thea-&quot; for the supposedly generic use of the Greek masculine prefix &quot;theo-&quot;. It refers to the activity of determining the meaning of Goddess as opposed to theology, which reflects on the meaning of God. Frequently used to mean analysis of Goddess thought and mysticism, it can also be used more liberally to mean any kind of divine, not just deity divine, as in meditation, ethics, ritual pragmatics.

Capitalization of terms such as &quot;Goddess&quot; and &quot;Goddesses&quot; usually vary with author or with the style guides of publications or publishers. Within the Goddess community, members generally consider it proper to capitalize the word &quot;Goddess&quot;, but not necessary when generic references are made, as in the word &quot;goddesses&quot;.

== Use of mythological materials ==
Participants in the Goddess movement often invoke ancient religion and mythology. Some skeptics argue that these have been reconstructed from ancient sources and others are modern inventions. Indeed, these myths are not interpreted literally, but rather figuratively or metaphorically as reflecting ancient understandings and worldviews. For instance, creation myths are not seen as conflicting with scientific understanding but rather as being poetic, metaphoric statements that are compatible with, for example, the theory of evolution, modern cosmology, and physics. Mythological sources of the Goddess movement are often considered modern reconstructions of ancient myths that predated a &quot;patriarchal period,&quot; the Great Goddess hypothesis, influenced by the Kurgan hypothesis, and therefore very little would have been written about them. Aside from the reflection of ancient understanding of these, there are adherents who also turn to contemporary scholarship and literature such as Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. Some of this work&#x27;s interpretation of the Greek mythology (based mainly on James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough,&quot; such as the annual sacrifice of a king that represents a god) were adopted as the basis to describe the goddess&#x27; aging and rejuvenation with the seasons. The myth of Demeter and Persephone is one that has often been reinterpreted.

A common claim within the Goddess movement is that myths from supposed ancient matriarchal societies were behind key elements in Christianity, particularly in the beliefs that &quot;matriarchies fostering goddess worship influenced the attitudes of early Christians toward Mary&quot; and that &quot;the Catholic Church was originally matriarchal with Mary Magdalene, not Peter, as its head.&quot; The Goddess movement views devotion to female Christian figures such as the female saints as a continuation of ancient Goddess worship.

== Theology ==
Goddess Spirituality characteristically shows diversity: no central body defines its dogma. Yet there is evolving consensus on some issues such as: the Goddess in relation to polytheism, monotheism, and pantheism; and immanence versus transcendence, and other ways to understand the nature of the Goddess. There is also the emerging agreement that the Goddess fulfills the basic functions of empowering women and fostering ethical and harmonious relationships among different peoples as well as between humans, animals, and nature.

=== One or many? ===
One question often asked is whether Goddess adherents believe in one Goddess or many goddesses: Is Goddess spirituality monotheistic or polytheistic? This is not an issue for many of those in the Goddess movement, whose conceptualization of divinity is more all-encompassing. The terms &quot;the Goddess&quot;, or &quot;Great Goddess&quot; may appear monotheistic because the singular noun is used. However, these terms are most commonly used as code or shorthand for one or all of the following: to refer to certain types of prehistoric goddesses; to encompass all goddesses (a form of henotheism); to refer to a modern metaphoric concept of female deity; to describe a form of energy, or a process.

The concept of a singular divine being with many expressions is not a new development in thought: it has been a major theme in India for many centuries, at the very least as far back as the 5th century, though hymns in the early Vedas too speak of a one-Goddess-many-goddesses concept.

=== Within or without? ===
Another point of discussion is whether the Goddess is immanent, or transcendent, or both, or something else. Starhawk speaks of the Goddess as immanent (infusing all of nature) but sometimes also simultaneously transcendent (existing independently of the material world). Many Goddess authors agree and also describe Goddess as, at one and the same time, immanently pantheistic and panentheistic. The former means that Goddess flows into and through each individual aspect of nature—each tree, blade of grass, human, animal, planet; the latter means that all exist within the Goddess.

Starhawk also speaks of the Goddess as both a psychological symbol and &quot;manifest reality. She exists &quot;and&quot; we create Her&quot; (italics hers). Carol P. Christ (2003), describes what she sees as similarities between Goddess theology and process theology, and suggests that Goddess theologians adopt more of the process viewpoint.

=== Deity versus metaphor ===
The theological variations that characterize the Goddess movement can also be classified into two: the views that describe the Goddess as a metaphor and those that consider the Goddess as a deity. The former emerged from among Jewish and Christian adherents and maintains that the Goddess serves as the means of talking about, imagining, or relating to the divine and this is demonstrated in the push to recover the feminine face of God based on scriptural and historical sources. On the other hand, the theology that the Goddess is a deity, with importantly and unchangeably female persona, emerged out of the feminists who came from polytheistic faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Native American, and traditional African religions. The goddesses in this theology are rarely understood as metaphors or images since they have distinct individual features and that worshippers can interact with their suprahuman personages or symbols.

== Ethics ==
Although the Goddess movement has no specific code of behavior, there are commonly held tenets and concepts within the movement that form a basis for ethical behavior. Those participants in Goddess spirituality who define themselves as Wiccan, usually follow what is known as the Wiccan Rede: &quot; &#x27;An it harm none, do what ye will&quot;, (&quot;&quot; being an archaic English word understood to mean &quot;if&quot;, or &quot;as long as&quot;). Many also believe in the Threefold Law, which states that &quot;what you send (or do), returns three times over&quot;. Some traditions believe that this means it will be returned to the sender three times, or in a portion three times in volume, while others say it will instead be returned to the sender on three levels of being—physical, mental, and spiritual. Still others postulate that the number &quot;three&quot; is symbolic, meant to indicate a magnified karmic result for one&#x27;s actions.

Some people in the Goddess movement honor the Triple Goddess of Maiden, Mother, and Crone. The Maiden aspect of the Goddess is the archetype of a young woman or a child, representing independence and strength; the Mother aspect is the archetype of a nurturing mature woman; and the Crone aspect is the archetype of an old woman that represents wisdom, change, and transformation.

Because the Crone aspect of the Goddess is understood by some to be destructive at times, some consider it to contain both positive and negative imagery and to present an ethical quandary. The Hindu Goddess Kali, or Kali Ma, is often seen as an example of the Crone aspect. The concept is that the corrective force in a Dark Age must be a righteously directed dark force. Thus, to combat the demons of ignorance, ego, anger, etc., the darker aspect manifests. Later on, even her fierce image softens in the love of her devotees. Her duality is easily reconciled with the monism of Hinduism, which claims to understand the fundamental unity of truth as being impersonal and stratified in an ego-knotted existence (such as the human condition), and thus to the evil or unrighteous she is destruction personified and to the loving and moral devotee she is nothing but the love of the mother.

Other Goddess ethical beliefs are that one should not harm the interconnected web of life, and that peace and partnership should be the goals, rather than war and domination. According to Goddess theologian Carol P. Christ the following are ethical touchstones:

== Prehistoric cultures ==

The Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as Marija Gimbutas, whose interpretation of artifacts excavated from &quot;Old Europe&quot; points to societies of Neolithic Europe that were &quot;matristic&quot; or &quot;goddess-centered&quot; worshipping a female deity of three primary aspects, which has inspired some neopagan worshippers of the Triple Goddess.

Heide Göttner-Abendroth, working in the 1970s to mid-1980s, called these cultures &quot;matriarchies&quot;, introducing a feminist field of &quot;Modern Matriarchal Studies&quot;. She presented a theory of the transformation of prehistoric cultures in which the local goddess was primary and the male god, if any, derived his power from the goddess. In what she terms the &quot;Downfall&quot;, which occurred at varying times throughout a multitude of cultures, the gods overcame and subjugated the goddesses.

Göttner-Abendroth&#x27;s terminology is idiosyncratic. The term &quot;matriarchy&quot; to describe these cultures has been rejected by many Goddess-movement scholars, especially those in North America, because it implies female domination as the reverse of male domination in patriarchy. These scholars deny such a reversal, asserting these prehistoric cultures were egalitarian, though matrilineal - inherited assets and parentage traced through the maternal line. According to Riane Eisler, cultures in which women and men shared power, and which worshiped female deities, were more peaceful than the patriarchal societies that followed.

Ian Hodder&#x27;s reinterpretation of Gimbutas and Mellaart&#x27;s works disputes the existence of &quot;matriarchal&quot; or &quot;matrifocal&quot; cultures, as do some other archaeologists and historians in this field. However, mythologist Joseph Campbell compared the importance of Gimbutas&#x27; output to the historical importance of the Rosetta Stone in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Marija Gimbutas, often dubbed &quot;Grandmother of the Goddess Movement&quot; in the 1990s, continues to be cited by many feminist writers, including Max Dashu. Many other scholars, including Joan Marler and Marguerite Rigoglioso, support her work. Still, Gimbutas&#x27; theories had been widely criticized as mistaken in their dating, archaeological context, and typologies. Some archaeologists consider her goddess hypothesis implausible, others dismissing her work as pseudo-scholarship.

==Wicca==
Wicca regards &quot;the Goddess&quot;, along with her consort the Horned God, as a deity of prime importance. The earliest Wiccan publications described the Goddess as a tribal goddess of the witch community, neither omnipotent nor universal.

Many forms of Wicca have come to regard the Goddess as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, similar to Egyptian goddess Isis; she also encompasses and conceives all life, much like the Greek goddess Gaia. Much like Isis, she is held to be the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various deities such as Diana, Hecate, and Isis, and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother, and Crone triad popularized by Robert Graves (see Triple Goddess below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on Celtic goddesses. Some Wiccans believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably Dianic Wicca, the Goddess alone is worshipped.

Some, but not all, participants in the Goddess movement self-identify as Wiccans or &#x27;witches&#x27;. Other participants of the Goddess movement call themselves goddessians while others identify as the more generic &quot;pagans&quot;.

Some Wiccans, especially Dianics, attempt to trace the historical origins of their beliefs to Neolithic pre-Christian cultures, seeing Wiccanism as a distillation of a religion found at the beginning of most, if not all, cultures. They regard wise women and midwives as the first Wiccan witches. Dianic Wicca first became visible in the 1970s, alongside the writings of Zsuzsanna Budapest. Her feminist interpretation of witchcraft followed a few decades after the founding of Wicca by Gerald Gardner in the 1940s. Today, there are at least 800,000 individuals who consider themselves Wiccan followers or witches in North America.

Gardner and Valiente advocated a proto-feminist ideal of priestess authority in service to the Wiccan God and Goddess. Covens in &quot;traditional&quot; Wicca (i.e., those run along the lines described by Gardner and Valiente) had and have pretty much equal leadership both of a priest and of a priestess; but often consider the priestess &quot;prima inter pares&quot; (first among equals) - according to the book &quot;A Witches&#x27; Bible&quot;, by Stewart and Janet Farrar.

Doreen Valiente became known in Britain as the &#x27;Mother of the Craft&#x27; and contributed extensively to Wicca&#x27;s written tradition. She is the author of The Witches&#x27; Creed, which lays out the basics of Wiccan religious belief and philosophy; including the polarity of the God and the Goddess as the two great &quot;powers of Nature&quot; and the two &quot;mystical pillars&quot; of the religion. One way to characterize the central male-female divine dyad in Wicca is to say that it&#x27;s a duotheistic religion with a theology based on the divine gender polarity of male and female.

The idea of witchcraft as the remnants of an old pagan religion was first suggested to a wide readership by Margaret Murray&#x27;s books, &quot;The Witch-Cult in Western Europe&quot;, &quot;The God of the Witches&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Divine King in England&quot;. Her works have since been discredited by other scholars but have left a feminist legacy upon Wiccan culture.

Wicca and Neopaganism, and to some extent the Goddess movement, were influenced by 19th-century occultism, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as the Romantic movement in which both male and female were valued and honored as sacred, in contrast to and perhaps in reaction to mainstream Christian spirituality, especially if veneration of Mary by most Christians is not considered. Such views are described, for example, in the work of Robert Graves, especially &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (the origin of the neopagan &#x27;Triple Goddess&#x27; concept) and &quot;Mammon and the Black Goddess&quot;.

Wicca was also heavily influenced by the ideas of alchemic symbolism, which emphasized the essential complementary polarity of male and female, and that characterized that basic duality or gender polarity as a partnership of the solar (male) and the lunar (female). In Wicca the Moon is the symbol of the Goddess and the Sun is the symbol of the God; and the central liturgical mystery and ritual act is &quot;The Great Rite&quot; or Hieros Gamos, which is a symbolic union of the God and the Goddess, as the primal male and female powers of the cosmos. In alchemy this was known as &quot;the Chymical Wedding&quot; of the Sun and the Moon. In a parallel vein, traditional Wicca also draws heavily upon the Western Hermetic Tradition and its roots in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life; where the twin pillars of masculine and feminine divine forces are joined by a Middle Pillar that encompasses and transcends both male and female. These &quot;twin pillars&quot; as they are shown in tarot decks are analogous to Valiente&#x27;s depiction of the God and the Goddess as the two &quot;mystical pillars.&quot; In this emphasis on the feminine as the equal and complementary polar opposite of the masculine, Wicca echoes not only Kabbalistic sources but also the polarity of yin and yang—feminine and masculine—in Taoism.

There are, however, Wiccan groups that do not subscribe to the male-female dualism of the divine. For instance, there is the case of the Budapest Dianics. Although these retained many Wiccan rituals and symbols, they only used female imagery and created a creation myth that eliminated the need for the male. While Wiccans also accept male members, the Dianics called themselves a &quot;wimmin&#x27;s religion&quot; and, thus, rejected males from their ranks.

== Joseph Campbell ==
First broadcast on PBS in 1988 as a documentary interview with Bill Moyers, &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, written by Joseph Campbell, was also released in the same year as a book created under the direction of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; links the image of the Earth or Mother Goddess to symbols of fertility and reproduction. For example, Campbell states that, &quot;There have been systems of religion where the mother is the prime parent, the source... We talk of Mother Earth. And in Egypt you have the Mother Heavens, the Goddess Nut, who is represented as the whole heavenly sphere&quot;. Campbell continues by stating that the correlation between fertility and the Goddess found its roots in agriculture:


Campbell also argues that the image of the Virgin Mary was derived from the image of Isis and her child Horus: &quot;The antique model for the Madonna, actually, is Isis with Horus at her breast&quot;, see Isis#Possible influence on Christianity.

According to Joseph Campbell,

One of these metaphors is &quot;Eve&quot;. Campbell argues that Christianity, originally a denomination of Judaism, embraced part of the Jewish pagan culture and the &quot;rib metaphor&quot; is an example of how distant the Jewish religion was from the prehistoric religion—the worship of the Mother Goddess or the Goddess.

== Earth as Goddess ==

Many people involved in the Goddess movement regard the Earth as a living Goddess. For some this may be figurative, for others literal. This literal belief is similar to that proposed by Gaia hypothesis, and the Goddess-name Gaia is sometimes used as a synonym for the Earth. For the Goddess-movement practitioners, Gaia personifies the entire earthly ecosystem and is the means to achieve harmonic symbiosis or the wholeness and balance within the natural worlds and physical environment. Many of those in the Goddess movement become involved in ecofeminism, and are concerned with environmental and ecological issues. Goddess-movement adherents claim the hierarchical scheme giving humans dominion over the Earth (and nature) has led to lack of respect and concern for the Earth, and thus to what scientists identify as environmental crises, such as global warming. Rather than having dominion over the Earth, Goddess-movement theorists see humans living as part of the Earth environment, and also refer to Earth as &quot;Mother&quot;. Here, humans are considered on equal level with non-human inhabitants since all must be accorded the same moral and religious consideration, respect, and reverence.

Some such as Monica Sjöö cite that this focus on the environment is one of the aspects that distinguishes the goddess movement with the New Age movement. The former is sometimes mistaken as a subcategory of the latter due to the way the goddess movement draw from many resources that are New Age in character, including esoterica, mystery traditions, magic, astrology, divinatory techniques, and shamanism. Both are also concerned with valuing one&#x27;s self as inherently sacred. The goddess movement, on the other hand, is equally concerned with valuing the environment, including its human and non-human inhabitants. This attitude towards the environment is reflected in the way the movement view the concepts of femaleness, the deity, and politics. In comparison with the traditional theology where God is placed at the top of the hierarchical system, ruling over man and nature, the movement maintains that humanity and divinity must not be distinguished from nature or that earth is the body of the goddess and all beings are interconnected in the web of life.

== Reclaiming ==

Reclaiming Witchcraft is an organization of feminist modern Witchcraft, aiming to combine the Goddess movement with political activism (in the peace and anti-nuclear movements). &quot;Reclaiming&quot; was founded in 1979, in the context of the &quot;Reclaiming Collective&quot; (1978–1997), by two Neopagan women of Jewish descent, Starhawk (Miriam Simos) and Diane Baker, in order to explore and develop feminist Neopagan emancipatory rituals. The specific period of its founding can be traced back to the civil action during the 1970s&#x27; Diablo Canyon protest, which opposed the construction of a nuclear plant.

Today, the organization focuses on progressive social, political, environmental, and economic activism. Reclaiming integrates magic rituals and instruction to its political activism. For instance, followers performed the spiral dances during its protest meetings against the World Trade Organization and other agencies of globalization. The Reclaiming also encourages its members to seek knowledge and enlightenment outside of the movement since it does not claim a monopoly of the so-called Wiccan truth.

<text>Selwyn College is a residential college affiliated to the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. It was founded by Bishop Samuel Tarratt Nevill as a theological college training clergy for the Anglican Church and as a hall of residence for students attending the university. It is named after George Augustus Selwyn, the first Bishop of New Zealand and is owned by the Anglican Diocese of Dunedin.
It was opened on 15 January 1893. It was Otago&#x27;s first residential college and on the model of an English university college it included students of all subjects. Women were admitted in 1983. The main building is listed as a Category II Historic Place. Selwyn is one of the most popular colleges in Dunedin, its 214 available places oversubscribed every year.

Bishop Nevill was the pioneer of the Oxbridge-esque collegiate system at Otago and founded Selwyn college in 1893.

==College life==

===Competitions and events===
In 1930 Selwyn College and College House (a University of Canterbury hall of residence) began an annual sporting and cultural exchange. This still occurs with the Principal&#x27;s and Warden&#x27;s Cup being added into the prize mix after the 1980s. The exchange historically concludes with a Boat Race between the two colleges, with Selwyn winning the race in 2015. Selwyn is generally not involved with the OUSA Orientation events, such as the toga parade, instead holding its own events, such as the Ori Ball. In 1932, initiations at Selwyn College were started including the Turner Tossing Trophy (now replaced with the Homage Run) and the Leith Run in 1935. The Lindskii Battle and the 21sters Ball are still annual events at the college and are immensely popular with the residents.
Selwyn College and Knox College also compete for the Nevill Cup, a cultural competition, and the Cameron Shield, a sporting competition. These are intense contests, fiercely fought out each year. Selwyn college holds both The Cameron Shield and The Nevill Cup.

===Selwyn College Students&#x27; Association (SCSA)===
The Selwyn College Students&#x27; Association is an incorporated society consisting of all current residents of the college, with membership automatic upon entry. The SCSA is responsible for maintaining the student life of the college, including managing the Cameron Shield and Nevill Cup with Knox College and the exchange with College House. A number of social events populate the student calendar, notably Selwyn&#x27;s own O-Week and ReO schedules. The SCSA is also charged with preserving the rich history and traditions laid down by those who have gone before.

The General Committee of the Selwyn College Students&#x27; Association is an elected panel of second-year residents who run the college&#x27;s student life. Members have various responsibilities that concern their different roles.

==Building history==

===All Saints&#x27; church===
The college is sited behind All Saints&#x27; Church, Dunedin on Cumberland Street which is both the college chapel and with the college buildings form a larger Anglican precinct. The church&#x27;s nave was opened in 1865, designed by the partnership of Mason &amp; Clayton although it is not entirely clear if William Mason (William Mason (architect)) or W.H. Clayton (William Clayton (architect)) was responsible. Some sources favour Clayton. The transepts and chancel added in 1873 were certainly the work of Mason. The church&#x27;s principally red brick construction perhaps set the theme for the later complex although its Early English Gothic style (English Gothic architecture) (Gothic revival architecture) is in contrast with the main college buildings&#x27; domestic Tudor manner (Tudor style architecture).

All Saints&#x27; is a significant structure. It reflects the arrival in New Zealand of the influence of the Oxford Movement and The Ecclesiological Society, developments in thought about the Gothic revival epitomised by the work of William Butterfield (1814–1900). His All Saints, Margaret Street in London had been completed in 1859 and one supposes was known to the designers of its Dunedin namesake. The latter&#x27;s slate roof has been replaced with decramastic tiles and its east and south walls have been rendered in cement which rather spoils its appearance and reduces its complementarity with the principal college buildings. (There are plans to remedy some of these defects.) The church hall immediately to the north is a wooden structure which was rendered in cement in the 1960s. The vicarage site is immediately to the north again, the current vicarage is of mid-20th-century origin.

===Early outlay===

In 1891 work started on the first college building behind the church and facing Castle Street to the design of J.A. Burnside (1856–1920). It appears to have been complete by October 1892 and was dedicated on 25 January the following year. Burnside also designed Transit House, a blue stone mansion in Park Street and the oldest part of the Otago Settlers Museum. His building for the college is the range to the north of the archway, including one of its towers, to first floor height. He seems to have anticipated its later extrapolation into the full range with the central archway and two towers, the arch centred on the unusual, gabled chancel of All Saints&#x27;. In red brick in the Domestic Tudor Gothic style it uses the same manner employed at Selwyn College, Cambridge which is perhaps not an accident. (Sir Arthur Blomfield&#x27;s chapel there was completed in 1895.) Indeed, these two Selwyn Colleges&#x27; histories are indirectly linked since, prior to the foundation of the Selwyn College in Cambridge, Bishop Nevill had urged that that institution should be established in New Zealand, rather than in England. While modest by comparison, especially this first small portion of the later, larger range, the Castle Street building was a pleasing exercise in the manner and capable of expansion into a more impressive composition.

Just that happened in 1929 to 1930 when Burnside&#x27;s building was extended into the present range. Adding a third floor to Burnside&#x27;s structure it formed the arch with its towers and its oriel window and extended in two reaches to the south, the further slightly set back from the street. This was the work of, or certainly supervised by, H. McDowell Smith (1887–1965) and cost 13,840 pounds. There was a dining room on the ground floor with a bay window looking into the quadrangle with good stone lattice work and the interior decorated in period style. The whole building, with its archway, makes a clear reference to Hampton Court Palace in England.

===Later extensions===
In 1950 and 1956 McDowell Smith was called on again to add another large building to the complex. Sargood Hall, named after a major benefactor, extends at right angles from the southern reach of the Castle Street range to form the south flank of the interior quadrangle. This too is in red brick in the Domestic Tudor style which by this time, after the second world war, represented a bold and expensive decision in New Zealand. The whole project appears to have cost something more than 25,000 pounds. The building is free standing with a narrow passage between it and the Castle Street range. It is two storeyed. Its principal, north face has a central break front with a pleasingly modelled entrance and the Hall&#x27;s name in raised relief in a stone fascia above. There are also forward reaching fronts at either end of the main elevation.

When the College Board next determined to extend the complex, in 1966, it again wished to build &quot;on traditional lines&quot;, that is in period style. It wanted another three-storeyed wing to the north of the Castle Street range, perhaps meaning to complete the quadrangle. Its efforts to raise the necessary 80,000 pounds were unsuccessful. It decided instead to build three separate three storeyed residential blocks and commissioned one from Miller, White and Dunn, a Dunedin architectural practice. In the event only one was built, Nevill House, which opened on 4 March 1973. This is a small tower, immediately to the north of the Castle Street range and close to the street, of Modernist design. Its concrete framework is visibly expressed and it has red brick infills to contextualise it.

A further extension was made with another free standing building to the north again, to house the library which was completed on 1 August 1976. It was called the Northcroft Library, after another generous donor and was designed by John Harrison (b. 1935). Amidst controversy the library was dispersed in 1988. This is another Modernist building but now in contrasting materials. The most dissonant structure in the group it has steeply inclined slab roofs and extensive areas of glazing.

In 1988 too the first of three buildings providing self-contained flats was completed, Irvine House. Further to the north Millar House and Newcombe House were completed in 1989. These were all designed by Roger Dodd (1939–2001). Millar and Newcombe Houses face Dundas Street, the thoroughfare linking Castle to Cumberland Street at the north end of the city block containing Selwyn College. The two are linked to form an archway giving access to the quadrangle from the north. All three of these buildings are two storeyed and are finished in unpainted, rendered cement. Their forms are those of hipped roof houses. They are rather plain and the northward linked pair are set behind a brick wall along the street.

In 1993 the archway of the Castle Street range was shut off for security reasons with a large glass wall incorporating a door of the same material. The view from the street to the All Saints chancel remained. It has since been eclipsed by the construction of a solid walled cross way joining the ground floor of each wing through the archway.

===Summary===
There are some other college buildings more or less integral to the group but the Castle Street range and Sargood Hall with their orientation around All Saints church show a sustained and successful effort to build a university hall of residence in the revived Tudor style. If it is less developed than its rival Knox College&#x27;s suite it is perhaps more simply attractive.

<doc id="1088372" wikidata="Q469299" url="?curid=1088372" title="Hassan al-Turabi">
<text>Hassan al-Turabi (; 1 February 1932 – 5 March 2016) was a Sudanese politician and scholar. He was the alleged architect of the 1989 Sudanese military coup that overthrew Sadiq al-Mahdi and installed Omar al-Bashir as president. He has been called &quot;one of the most influential figures in modern Sudanese politics&quot; and a &quot;longtime hard-line ideological leader&quot;. He was instrumental in institutionalizing &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) in the northern part of the country and was frequently imprisoned in Sudan, but these &quot;periods of detention&quot; were &quot;interspersed with periods of high political office&quot;.

al-Turabi was leader of the National Islamic Front (NIF) (which later changed its name to National Congress in the late 1990s), a political movement that developed considerable political power in Sudan while never obtaining significant popularity among Sudanese voters. It embraced a &quot;top down&quot; approach to Islamisation by placing party members in high posts in government and security services. al-Turabi and the NIF reached the peak of their power from 1989 following a military coup d&#x27;état, until 2001, as what Human Rights Watch have called &quot;the power behind the throne&quot;, head of the only Sunni Islamist movement to take control of a state.

al-Turabi oversaw highly controversial policies such as the creation of the &quot;NIF police state&quot; and associated NIF militias that consolidated Islamist power and prevented a popular uprising, but according to Human Rights Watch committed many human rights abuses, including &quot;summary executions, torture, ill treatment, arbitrary detentions, denial of freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion, and violations of the rules of war, particularly in the south&quot;. Turabi was a leader of opposition to the American–Saudi &quot;coalition forces&quot; in the Gulf War, establishing in 1990–1991 the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress (PAIC), a regional umbrella for political Islamist militants, headquartered in Khartoum.

After 1996, al-Turabi and his party&#x27;s &quot;internationalist and ideological wing&quot; saw a decline in influence in favor of more pragmatic leaders, brought on by the imposition of UN sanctions on Sudan in punishment for Sudan&#x27;s assistance to Egyptian Islamic Jihad in their attempt to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. al-Turabi was out of power beginning in 1999, leading a splinter group of the National Congress known as the Popular National Congress. He was imprisoned by Omar Al-Bashir on 17 January 2011 for nine days, following civil unrest across the Arab world. He died in 2016 without facing trial for his role in the 1989 coup.

==Early life and education==
al-Turabi was born on 1 February 1932 in Kassala, eastern Sudan, to a Sufi Muslim sheikh, and received an Islamic education, before coming to Khartoum in 1951 to study law and joined the Muslim Brotherhood as a student. He graduated from Khartoum University School of Law in 1955 and also studied in London and at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1962, where he gained a PhD. He became a leader of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1960s. He is a descendant of a famous 17th-century religious sheikh, Hamad al-Turabi.

==Religious and political beliefs==
Turabi&#x27;s writings, rhetoric, sermons, and public pronouncements have often been described as progressive, theologically liberal, &quot;moderate and thoughtful&quot;, but his time in power was notable for harsh human rights violations. The diplomat Andrew Natsios explained these contradictions by claiming that he took more moderate positions when being interviewed by English and French-speaking interviewers when compared to his speeches to his fellow Islamists.

al-Turabi&#x27;s philosophy drew selectively from Sudanese, Islamic, and Western political thought to fashion an ideology for the pursuit of power. al-Turabi supported Sharia and the concept of an Islamic state, but his vision was not Wahhabi or Salafi. He appreciated that the majority of Sudanese followed Sufi Islam, which he set out to change with new ideas. He did not extend legitimacy to Sufis, Mahdists, and Islamic scholars, whom he saw as incapable of addressing the challenges of modern life. One of the strengths of his vision was to consider different trends in Islam. Although the political base for his ideas was probably relatively small, he had an important influence on Sudanese politics and religion.

His views on the role of women in society were relatively progressive. al-Turabi had his greatest success in recruiting supporters from the educated and professional classes in urban areas. He attached fundamental importance to the concept of shura (consultation) and &quot;ibtila&quot;, his view of modernity, which he believed should lead to a more profound worship of God. Religion was regularly tested by the reality of &quot;ibtila&quot;.

As a Sunni Islamist, Turabi&#x27;s ideas differed in some ways from traditional Islamic ideas, such as in his lack of reverence for professional Islamic scholars. Rather than the ulama (class of Islamic scholars) being restricted to educated Islamic scholars, he stated that &quot;because all knowledge is divine and religious, a chemist, an engineer, an economist or a jurist are all ulamas.&quot; In fact, in an Islamic democracy, which Turabi maintained he was working towards, ideally there is no clerical ulama class, which prevents an elitist or theocratic government. Whether termed a religious, a theocratic, or even a secular theocracy, an Islamic state is not a government of the ulama.

al-Turabi originally espoused progressive Islamist ideas, such as the embrace of democracy, healing the breach and expanding the rights of women, where he noted:The Prophet himself used to visit women, not men, for counseling and advice. They could lead prayer. Even in his battles, they are there! In the election between Othman and Ali to determine who will be the successor to the Prophet, they voted!

He told another interviewer, &quot;I want women to work and become part of public life&quot; because &quot;the home doesn&#x27;t require much work anymore, what with all the appliances&quot;. During an interview on al-Arabiya TV in 2006, al-Turabi describes the word hijab as not a face veil but a cover or diaphragm put in a room to separate between men and the Prophet&#x27;s wives, whereas niqab is just an old Arab habit. Hijab literally means &quot;barrier&quot; and he said it was &quot;a curtain in the Prophet&#x27;s room. Naturally, it was impossible for the Prophet&#x27;s wife to sit there when people entered the room&quot;. The Prophet&#x27;s wives sat behind it when talking to males because they were not allowed to show their faces. He opposed the death penalty for apostasy from Islam and opposed Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s death sentence fatwa against Salman Rushdie. He declared Islamist organizations &quot;too focused on narrow historical debates and behavioral issues of what should be forbidden, at the expense of economic and social development&quot;.

al-Turabi also laid out his vision for Sharia law that would be applied gradually instead of forcefully and would apply only to Muslims, who would share power with the Christians in a federal system.

In contrast Natsios writes that when in power, one of the pieces of national legislation he pressed for was that apostasy be punished by the death penalty, a position he has since disavowed. When he talks about women&#x27;s rights, he is referring exclusively to Muslim women, whose honor and virtue will be protected within the context of Sharia law, ... Christian or non-Muslim women may be treated as property without rights or protection.
In 2006, out-of-power again, al-Turabi made international headlines issuing a fatwa allowing Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men, and allowing alcohol consumption in certain situations, in contradiction to historical Sharia law. He also embraced human rights and democracy in &quot;a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn&quot; of his views. One critic of Turabi complained to an American journalist in Khartoum of Turabi&#x27;s ideological reversal, saying, &quot;it is said in the daily papers and in the discussion centers here in the university that Turabi killed Ustazh Mahmoud&quot;, (i.e. liberal Sudanese cleric Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, hanged in 1985), &quot;and now he’s stealing his ideas.&quot;

==Political career==
Early in his career, al-Turabi took control of Islamic Liberation Movement under the name of the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood. In 1964 he became secretary-general of the Islamic Charter Front (ICF), an activist movement that served as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected to parliament in the mid-1960s. He headed the Front of the Islamic Pact and the Party of the Islamic Bloc from 1964 50 1969. Following the military coup in 1969, Gaafar Nimeiry jailed al-Turabi for seven years. Released in 1977, al-Turabi became attorney general in 1979 and then Nimeiry’s foreign affairs adviser in 1983. Nimeiry put him back in prison in 1985; the new military government released him later the same year. al-Turabi established the National Islamic Front (NIF) in 1985 as a replacement for the ICF. al-Turabi held several ministerial positions in government of the democratically elected Sadiq al-Mahdi, which the NIF joined in 1988 as a coalition partner, but he was never comfortable with this arrangement.

==National Islamic Front rule==
On 30 June 1989, a coup d&#x27;état by General Omar Hassan al-Bashir began a process of severe repression, including purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists. From 1989 until 2001, Turabi served as what observers have called the &quot;intellectual architect&quot;, or &quot;the power behind the throne&quot;, sometimes officially as leader of the NIF and sometimes as speaker of the parliamentary assembly.

===1989 coup===
While there is a &quot;pervasive belief&quot; in Sudan that Turabi and the NIF actively collaborated with the coup-makers who called themselves the &quot;Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation&quot;, in fact the RCC-NS banned all political parties following the 1989 coup and arrested Turabi, as well as the leaders of other political parties, and held him in solitary confinement for several months. Before long however, NIF influence within the government was evident in its policies and in the presence of several NIF members in the cabinet.
===Alleged abuses===
Alleged human rights abuses by the NIF regime included war crimes, ethnic cleansing, a revival of slavery, torture of opponents, and an unprecedented number of refugees fleeing into Uganda, Kenya, Eritrea, Egypt, Europe and North America.

In 1994 a report issued by Human Rights Watch/Africa, conducted by Gáspár Bíró, a Hungarian law professor and the United Nations&#x27; special envoy to Sudan in 1993 found the Sudanese government to be practicing &quot;widespread and systematic torture&quot; of political detainees.Once uncommon in the Sudan, torture was now widespread, especially in the south. Non-Muslim women were raped, their children taken from them; paper bags filled with chili powder were placed over men&#x27;s heads, and some were tied to anthills; testicles were crushed and burned by cigarettes and electric current, according to a 1994 report by Human Rights Watch/Africa. 

===Karate attack on al-Turabi in Ottawa===
On 26 May 1992 al-Turabi was attacked at the Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport in Canada by Sudanese Karate Black belt master, Hashim Bedreddin Mohammed. He attacked al-Turabi by using two knifehand strikes to knock down Turabi, whose head struck the pavement putting him into a coma. Hashim was a Sufi in exile and an opponent of the National Islamic Front Islamist regime in Sudan and had won a karate world championship in 1983. He attacked al-Turabi in a rage when he saw him. A Somali man pushed Hashim away with a trolley which weakened the blow that could have otherwise killed al-Turabi. al-Turabi was hospitalized for 4 weeks with constant black outs. After al-Turabi was knocked out, Hashim assumed he was dead and departed. al-Turabi suffered from severe injuries, the use of his right arm was lost for a while, he had slurred speech and required the use of a cane. Hashim was supported by exiled Sudanese in Canada who launched the &quot;Friends of Hashim Campaign&quot; to support his attack on al-Turabi. One said &quot;most Sudanese would appreciate what Hashim did&quot;. They called for an end to Islamist policies and a return to secularism.

==Links to militant groups==

Al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader Osama bin Laden moved his base of operations from Saudi Arabia to Sudan around 1991 reportedly at the personal invitation of al-Turabi, and stayed until 1996 when he moved to Afghanistan. Bin Laden moved to Sudan after conflict with the Saudi government over their granting of permission to the United States to station troops in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein. Bin Laden believed he should lead the fight against Saddam using Afghan Arab forces. al-Turabi granted bin Laden a safe place from which to conduct jihadist activities; in return, bin Laden agreed to help the Sudanese government in roadbuilding and to fight animist and Christian separatists in Southern Sudan. While in Sudan, bin Laden is reported to have married one of al-Turabi&#x27;s nieces.

Other violent groups al-Turabi invited and allowed to operate freely included Abu Nidal Organization, (which reportedly had killed more than 900 people in 20 different countries) Hezbollah, and Carlos the Jackal, (posing as a French arms dealer at the time). Carlos had converted from Marxism to Islamic extremism. (Sudanese sanctuary was not unconditional as it later allowed French intelligence to kidnap Carlos the Jackal while he was undergoing an operation on his right testicle.&quot;)

al-Turabi founded the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress in 1990–1991. Meeting here were several Islamic groups from around the world, including representatives from the Palestine Liberation Organization, Hamas, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Algerian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. In late 1991 or 1992 al-Turabi sought to persuade Shiites and Sunnis to put aside their divisions and join against the common enemy.

In August 1993, Sudan was placed on the United States&#x27; list of State Sponsors of Terrorism following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in February. The U.S. State Department notes that &quot;five of 15 suspects arrested&quot; following the bombing were Sudanese.

===Mubarak assassination attempt===
Two years later an assassination attempt was made on then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak by Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization, many of whose members were living in exile in Sudan. Evidence from the Egyptian and Ethiopian governments implicated the Sudanese governmentThe debacle led to a unanimous vote in the United Nations to impose stiff economic sanctions on Sudan. The Sudanese representative denied the charges, but the Sudanese delegation was already in disfavor, having been implicated only two years earlier in a plot to blow up UN headquarters.

Rather than disassociate himself from the plot, al-Turabi praised the attempted killing and called Mubarak stupid: The sons of the Prophet Moses, the Muslims, rose up against him confounded his plans, and sent him back to his country...I found the man to be very far below my level of thinking and my view, and too stupid to understand my pronouncements.

==Decline of influence==
International sanctions took effect in April 1996 and were accompanied by a &quot;general withdrawal of the diplomatic community&quot; from Khartoum. At the same time Sudan worked to appease the United States and other international critics by expelling members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and encouraging bin Laden to leave.

In March 1996, national elections were held for the first time since the coup, and al-Turabi was elected to a seat in the National Assembly, where he served as speaker during the 1990s. This was his first instance of holding a political position with some consistency. During the &quot;last few years of the 1990s&quot;, his influence and that of his party&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;internationalist&#x27; and ideological wing&quot; waned &quot;in favor of the &#x27;nationalist&#x27; or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan&#x27;s disastrous international isolation and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism&quot;.

===Imprisonment and later years===
After a political falling out with President Omar al-Bashir in 1999, al-Turabi was imprisoned based on allegations of conspiracy before being released in October 2003. Arrested again in 2004 for allegedly being part of a plot to overthrow the government, he was released on 28 June 2005.

In 2004 he was reported to have been associated with the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), an Islamist armed rebel group involved in the War in Darfur, whose leader, Khalil Ibrahim used to be one of Mr Turabi&#x27;s followers. al-Turabi himself has denied any association. Turabi spent 16 months in prison from 2004 until 28 June 2005, during which time he spent several weeks on a hunger strike.

After the JEM attacked Khartoum and Omdurman on 10 May 2008, al-Turabi was arrested on the morning of 12 May 2008, along with other members of his Popular Congress Party (PCP). He said that he had expected the arrest, which occurred while he was returning to Khartoum from a PCP gathering in Sennar. He was questioned and released without charge later in the day, after about 12 hours in detention.

Presidential advisor Mustafa Osman Ismail said that al-Turabi&#x27;s name had been found on JEM documents, but he denied that al-Turabi had been arrested, asserting that he had merely been &quot;summoned&quot; for questioning. al-Turabi, however, said that it was an arrest and that he had been held at Kobar Prison. According to al-Turabi, he was questioned regarding the relationship between the PCP and JEM, but he did not answer this question, although he denied that there was a relationship after his release; he also said that he was asked why he did not condemn the rebel attack. He said that the security officers questioning him had &quot;terrified&quot; him and that, although they claimed to have proof against him, they did not show him this proof when he asked to see it.

Salva Kiir Mayardit, the First Vice-President of Sudan and President of the Government of Southern Sudan, said that there had been no discussion about arresting al-Turabi at a presidency meeting on the previous day and that there was no security report implicating him. He alleged that al-Turabi was being used as a scapegoat.

In an interview on 17 May 2008, al-Turabi described the JEM&#x27;s attack on Khartoum as &quot;positive&quot; and said that there was &quot;so much misery in Darfur, genocidal measures actually&quot;. He also said that the JEM attack could spark more unrest.

On 12 January 2009, al-Turabi called on Bashir to surrender himself to the International Criminal Court for the sake of the country, while holding Bashir politically responsible for war crimes in Darfur. (He later changed his position and opposed Bashir turning himself in.) He was then arrested on 14 January and held in prison for two months (until 8 March) at the Kobar Prison before being moved to Port Sudan prison. During this time members of his family expressed concern about his health and his being held in solitary confinement at least some of the time. Amnesty International also released a statement about al-Turabi&#x27;s arrest on 16 January, describing it as &quot;arbitrary&quot; and politically motivated. Noting al-Turabi&#x27;s advanced age and his need for medication and a special diet. The Sudanese Media Centre reported on 19 January that al-Turabi would be put on trial for his alleged assistance to the JEM.

On 8 March, he was released only days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Omar al-Bashir. On 11 April 2009, the PCP called for the creation of a transitional government to lead Sudan to the planned 2010 election, and al-Turabi suggested that he would not stand as a candidate due to his advanced age; he emphasized the importance of leadership coming from younger generations and said that he did not have enough energy to run. In April al-Turabi was stopped at Khartoum International Airport and prevented from travelling to Paris for medical tests despite having obtained permission to travel from the interior ministry.

al-Turabi announced on 2 January 2010 that the PCP had designated his deputy, Abdallah Deng Nhial, as its candidate for the 2010 presidential election. al-Turabi was again arrested in mid May 2010, but was released on 1 July 2010.

On 18 January 2011, security forces arrested al-Turabi in Khartoum, presumably due to the recent instability of Sudan’s politics. al-Turabi commented on the recent price rises in Sudan stating it could result at a &quot;popular uprising&quot; if the unrealistic rises were not reversed. He added that the government should take lessons from the recent Tunisian Revolution.

== Death ==
On 5 March 2016, Turabi died at a hospital in Khartoum at the age of 84. He was believed to have died of a heart attack. Turabi&#x27;s funeral was held the next day, with several thousand mourners in attendance, and he was buried at Burri Al-Lamab, a cemetery in eastern Khartoum.

<text>.co is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) assigned to Colombia. 

It is administered by .CO Internet S.A.S., a subsidiary of Neustar since 2014. , there were no registration restrictions on second-level .co domains; any individual or entity in the world can register a .co domain.

.CO Internet S.A.S. from Bogotá, Colombia, was appointed as the manager for the .co TLD through a public procurement process that took place in early 2009. .CO Internet received the re-delegation approval as the manager of the .co TLD by ICANN on December 9, 2009, and received formal confirmation of the request by the United States Department of Commerce on December 23, 2009.

Google treats .co as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted&quot;.

==Second-level domain names==

When they took over administration of the .CO domain, .CO Internet S.A.S. implemented new domain policies that were more flexible than the historic ones that had been administered by the University of the Andes. The new policies were adjusted to international best practices and defined in consultation with local and international communities. With the new policies, Colombia would be able to sell second-level domain names to the world, such as widgets.co, where previously only third-level domain-names were available, such as widgets.com.co.

Notable single letter .CO domain names that have been allocated include:

On September 15, 2010, .CO Internet S.A.S. had taken registrations for over 500,000 .CO domain names. , more than 1 million .CO domains had been registered by people in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. As of January 2014, that number has grown to over 1.6 million .CO domains registered. As of December 2018, there were 2.2 million.

With respect to search engine optimization, Google confirmed that &quot;it will rank .co domains appropriately if the content is globally targeted&quot;.

===Summary of policies since 2010===
* Any person or entity in the world can register .co domain names
* There are no domicile or burdensome documentation requirements
* Registration period is between 1 and 5 years, subject to renewal
* Registrants can easily transfer domain names

.CO domains became available via the following timeline:
* April 1, 2010 – April 20, 2010: Sunrise A allowed registered local trademarks to apply for exact match domains.
* April 26, 2010 – June 10, 2010: Sunrise B allowed trademarks of national effect to apply for exact match domains. 
* June 21, 2010 – July 13, 2010: Landrush allowed anyone to apply for domain names of high commercial value. 
* July 20, 2010: .co domains became generally available.

==Third-level domain registrations==

The third-level domain registrations closely mirror the &quot;traditional&quot; IANA .com/.net/.org/.gov/.edu/.mil-hierarchy, with the addition of a national equivalent of .name. Different from registrations directly under .co, which are used to signal globally-relevant interests, third-level domains are used to signal locally-relevant business, organizations, academic institutions, and government.
==History==

IANA delegates ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes as country code top-level domains, and on December 24, 1991, the .co top-level domain was assigned to Colombia and delegated to the Universidad de los Andes.

In 2001, the university began to consider the possibility of marketing the domain as an alternative to the generic top-level domains. The government of Colombia objected on the basis that the university, a private entity, did not have regulatory oversight of the TLD and the Minister of Communications, Angela Montoya Holguín, wrote to them requesting that they not continue. In turn the university wrote to ICANN, rejecting the government&#x27;s objections and stating their intention to appoint a subcontractor to handle the commercialization of the domain.

At a meeting on December 11, 2001, Holguín asked the Consultative Chamber and Civil Service of the Council of State to consider three issues:

# whether the .co domain is a public resource
# if the domain is public resource, whether it is intrinsically-linked with telecommunications
# if the domain is linked with telecommunications, who should profit from its commercialization

In relation to these three issues, the meeting concluded that:

# the .co domain, having been assigned to Colombia, is of public interest
# the administration of the domain is intrinsically-related to telecommunications, and hence falls under the purview of the Ministry of Communications, with the exception of those functions assigned to the ICFES by the Ministry of National Education
# unless the Congress of Colombia adopts an act allowing tax to be collected in relation to the registration of domain names, no amount can be charged for such a service

In response to the Council of State meeting, the university wrote to ICANN on 12 February 2002 stating that it had abandoned plans to commercialize the domain, and that as it could &quot;no longer bear the administrative and operational responsibilities&quot; it wished to discontinue its responsibility for operating the domain.

Finally, with the enactment of Law 1065 of 2006, the Ministry of Communications of Colombia initiated a public consultation process involving local and international participants, including members of the ICANN community, with the objective of defining the future of the .CO TLD. As a result of that process, through Resolution 001652 of 2008, the Ministry approved new policies that would govern the administration of the .CO TLD. A public procurement process began which resulted in the award of the administration contract to .CO Internet SAS. Finally, on February 7, 2010, the administration of the TLD was transitioned from the University of Andes to .CO Internet SAS, under the regulatory and policy supervision of the Ministry of Communications of Colombia.
On July 20, 2010, second level .co domains became available to the rest of the world on a first-come, first-served basis. In 2014, .CO Internet S.A.S was acquired by Neustar for US$109 Million, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Neustar. It is responsible for the promotion, administration, and technical operation of the .co TLD.

In 2020, GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) acquired Neustar Registry and became the operator of .CO domain names.

==Accredited registrars==

Only accredited registrars are able to sell .co domain names directly; other registrars selling .co domain names are acting as resellers. The list of accredited registrars is available on the .CO Internet website, and as of October 2011 there are 20 accredited registrars. Some of the 20 registrars operate under multiple brands.

<doc id="1088385" wikidata="Q787623" url="?curid=1088385" title="Islamic Army in Iraq">
<text>The Islamic Army in Iraq (, IAI) was an underground Islamist militant organization formed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led Coalition forces, and the subsequent collapse of the Ba&#x27;athist regime headed by Saddam Hussein. IAI was regarded as one of the largest, sophisticated and most influential Sunni insurgent groups in Iraq that led an asymmetrical military insurgency against Coalition forces. The group became known for its grisly videos of kidnappings and attacks on U.S. and Iraqi troops.

Although it carries an Islamic title, the group combines Sunni Islamism with Iraqi nationalism, and has been labelled as &quot;resistance&quot; by Iraq&#x27;s Sunni Vice president Tariq al-Hashimi (who was sentenced to death in 2012) despite al-Hashimi&#x27;s close relations with the U.S. government.

Following the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in late 2011, the IAI largely demobilized and turned towards political activism, setting up the Sunni Popular Movement. The group’s turn away from armed opposition towards activism was criticised by other militant groups, including groups that the IAI had previously allied with such as the Mujahideen Army.

In the beginning of 2014, however, the group returned to armed militancy and was active anti-government violence in Anbar and Northern Iraq during the first phases of the War in Iraq (2013-17). The group was primarily active in the Diyala and Saladin Governorates. Most of its fighters have renounced fighting against the Iraqi state, although some have joined ISIS. Islamic Army in Iraq has not claimed any attacks since late 2014.

On the 9th of April, 2024, the group has published a video titled &quot;Come to Jihad&quot; (حي على الجهاد). This hour long video shows the history of activities the group was involved in and testifies that the group will come back. Furthermore, the group reannounces their opposition towards the Iranian government and ISIS. They also call for the Sunni Iraqis to join the group.

==Roots and ideology==
The precise details about the emergence of the IAI are unclear, although it is generally assumed that the group was established in the late summer of 2003 to fight and expel Coalition forces from Iraq. Former officers of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s army from Sunni strongholds such as Ramadi, Fallujah, Tikrit and Baqubah who were skilled ex-soldiers from the disbanded Republican Guard, Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service formed and joined the Islamic Army in Iraq (IAI).

When the IAI first formed, it used kidnapping as a means of pursuing its goals. The group also threatened to target the January 2005 elections, although it didn&#x27;t carry out any such attack. Unlike most terrorist organizations today, the IAI does not have Salafist tendencies, its primary focus and goal being the expulsion of foreign troops from Iraq. A November 2004 &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview with the group&#x27;s leader, Ishmael Jubouri, stated that the IAI was predominantly composed of Iraqis (Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, and Arabs) trying to force foreign troops out of Iraq. The Terrorism Monitor put out by The Jamestown Foundation confirms some of what Jubouri was claiming. In a March 2005 article, the monitor said the group was composed primarily of Sunnis with a small Shiite congregation and, in general, was &quot;[an] inclusive Islamic organization with Iraqi nationalist tendencies.&quot;

In a November 2006 Al Jazeera interview, spokesman Ibrahim al-Shamary expanded on who the IAI considers foreign troops, &quot;There are two occupations in Iraq. Iran on one side through the militias which they control and through direct involvement with the national guard and the intelligence services, that causes the killing and destruction of the Sunnis. ... And then there is the American occupation which destroys the Iraqi people.&quot;

The group has released several joint statements with other groups such as Islamic Resistance Movement and the Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance, which are known to be of an ikhwan background. In one of these joint statements, six groups (including the IAI) called for Iraqis to participate in the referendum on the October 2005 constitution by voting against it. (This was in conspicuous contrast to al-Qaeda in Iraq, which said that simply participating in voting is a compromise of the fundamentals of Islam, even if one were to vote against it.)

When rumours spread in Iraq of the alleged demolition of the al-Aqsa Mosque, in April 2005, the IAI announced the formation of the &quot;al-Aqsa Support Division.&quot; This group was to support Palestine in the armed struggle against Israel. The current status of the al-Aqsa Support Division is unknown, leading people to believe that the statement was merely rhetoric.

The group has shown support for the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and its fight against the Syrian government and allied Shiite paramilitary groups like Hezbollah. In June 2013, the IAI released a statement advising the FSA in methods in fighting. 

==Foreign hostages==
The group was responsible for the abduction of the following people who were released unharmed:
* Fereidoun Jahani; Iranian Consul.
* Georges Malbrunot (41) and Christian Chesnot (37); French journalists.
* Marwan Ibrahim al-Kassar and Mohammed Jawdat Hussein; Lebanese electrical workers.
* Angelo dela Cruz; Filipino truck driver.
* Rosidah Anom and Rafikan Binti Amin; female Indonesian nationals.

The IAI is also believed responsible for the execution of the following foreigners:
* Enzo Baldoni; Italian journalist killed on or about August 26, 2004.
* Raja Azad (49), engineer, and Sajad Naeem (29), his driver; Pakistani nationals working in Iraq for a Kuwaiti-based firm killed on or about July 28, 2004.
* Dalibor Lazarevski, Dragan Marković, and Zoran Naskovski; nationals of Republic of Macedonia, working for United Arab Emirates-based Soufan Engineering on contracts and subcontracts for the U.S. military and its private contractors. The three were seized in August 2004 and the Macedonian government confirmed their execution by October 21, 2004; receipt of videos depicting two beheadings were announced, but not broadcast, on al-Jazeera TV on October 17, 2004.
* Ronald Schulz; American contract electrician, killed around December 8, 2005.

==Other activities==
On 22 November 2003, the Islamic Army in Iraq organized and videotaped a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile attack on a DHL Airbus A300 leaving from Baghdad International Airport.

The Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for the 1 September 2004, assassination attempt against Iraqi politician Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National Congress, in which two of his bodyguards were killed, two were wounded and two went missing (the IAI admitted capturing one of Chalabi&#x27;s bodyguards and executing the other), and Chalabi escaped unharmed.

On 24 March 2005, the IAI claimed responsibility for a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) that detonated at a city entrance checkpoint in Ramadi. The attack killed 11 Iraqi police commandos and wounded 2 U.S. Marines and 2 Iraqi civilians.

On 22 April 2005, the IAI released a video of their members executing Lyubomir Kostov, a Bulgarian civilian contractor, who survived after the downing of his helicopter. He was helped to his feet and then shot with 27 rounds of ammunition. The group also claims to have shot down a commercial airliner in Iraq, although officials maintain the accident was caused by fog. The crash killed 34 people.

In 2006, videos were released of their snipers killing Coalition forces. The &quot;alleged name&quot; of the IAI sniper is &quot;Juba&quot;. These sniper videos were distributed for free to Iraqi citizens on CDs as part of a propaganda, recruiting campaign and as a means of waging psychological warfare on Coalition forces. Islamic Army videos of attacks on U.S.-led Coalition forces were aired on Al-Zawraa TV channel, which is now banned in Iraq.

As of 2011, the group&#x27;s content was distributed online by the Jihad Media Battalion (subtitled in English) and the Media Division of the Islamic Army in Iraq (subtitled in Arabic). These groups were considered distinct from al-Qaeda and the linked groups As-Sahab, Ansar ul-Mujahideen, and al-Fida Islamic Network and also distinct from the Global Islamic Media Front, Islamic Media Center, and the media center of the Islamic Jihad Army.

In the beginning of 2014, however, the group was active in the anti-government violence in Anbar and Northern Iraq and after the outbreak of the War in Iraq (2013-17). Most of its fighters have renounced fighting against the Iraqi state, although some have joined ISIS. Islamic Army in Iraq has not claimed any attacks since late 2014.

==War with al-Qaeda in Iraq==
In early 2007, the Islamic Army engaged in an armed conflict against Al-Qaeda in Iraq. In June, this ended in a ceasefire between the two rival groups. The IAI was quoted saying &quot;The most important thing is that it&#x27;s our common duty to fight the Americans;&quot; nevertheless, the groups never adopted al-Qaeda&#x27;s philosophy and refused to sign on to the al-Qaeda-led Islamic State of Iraq.

According to Iraqi sources, fighters from the Islamic Army battled Al-Qaeda gunmen around Samarra at least twice in October and November 2007, a possible indication that the cease-fire brokered earlier this year had collapsed (however, coalition officials later issued a statement claiming that Iraqi policemen and coalition troops, not Islamic Army fighters, had carried out the latter operation). Furthermore, although the Islamic Army denied that it had joined forces with the U.S. military, several news outlets reported that many Islamic Army commanders in and around Baghdad were now working together with the U.S.-led coalition to counter Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

<text>In mathematics, a reductive group is a type of linear algebraic group over a field. One definition is that a connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a perfect field is reductive if it has a representation that has a finite kernel and is a direct sum of irreducible representations. Reductive groups include some of the most important groups in mathematics, such as the general linear group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of invertible matrices, the special orthogonal group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), and the symplectic group &quot;Sp&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;). Simple algebraic groups and (more generally) semisimple algebraic groups are reductive.

Claude Chevalley showed that the classification of reductive groups is the same over any algebraically closed field. In particular, the simple algebraic groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams, as in the theory of compact Lie groups or complex semisimple Lie algebras. Reductive groups over an arbitrary field are harder to classify, but for many fields such as the real numbers R or a number field, the classification is well understood. The classification of finite simple groups says that most finite simple groups arise as the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of &quot;k&quot;-rational points of a simple algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a finite field &quot;k&quot;, or as minor variants of that construction.

Reductive groups have a rich representation theory in various contexts. First, one can study the representations of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; as an algebraic group, which are actions of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces. But also, one can study the complex representations of the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) when &quot;k&quot; is a finite field, or the infinite-dimensional unitary representations of a real reductive group, or the automorphic representations of an adelic algebraic group. The structure theory of reductive groups is used in all these areas.

==Definitions==

A linear algebraic group over a field &quot;k&quot; is defined as a smooth closed subgroup scheme of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;, for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;. Equivalently, a linear algebraic group over &quot;k&quot; is a smooth affine group scheme over &quot;k&quot;.

=== With the unipotent radical ===
A connected linear algebraic group formula_1 over an algebraically closed field is called semisimple if every smooth connected solvable normal subgroup of formula_1 is trivial. More generally, a connected linear algebraic group formula_1 over an algebraically closed field is called reductive if the largest smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup of formula_1 is trivial. This normal subgroup is called the unipotent radical and is denoted formula_5. (Some authors do not require reductive groups to be connected.) A group formula_1 over an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot; is called semisimple or reductive if the base change formula_7 is semisimple or reductive, where formula_8 is an algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;. (This is equivalent to the definition of reductive groups in the introduction when &quot;k&quot; is perfect.) Any torus over &quot;k&quot;, such as the multiplicative group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;, is reductive.

=== With representation theory ===
Over fields of characteristic zero another equivalent definition of a reductive group is a connected group formula_1 admitting a faithful semisimple representation which remains semisimple over its algebraic closure formula_10 page 424.

=== Simple reductive groups ===
A linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is called simple (or &quot;k&quot;-simple) if it is semisimple, nontrivial, and every smooth connected normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is trivial or equal to &quot;G&quot;. (Some authors call this property &quot;almost simple&quot;.) This differs slightly from the terminology for abstract groups, in that a simple algebraic group may have nontrivial center (although the center must be finite). For example, for any integer &quot;n&quot; at least 2 and any field &quot;k&quot;, the group &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; is simple, and its center is the group scheme μ&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity.

A central isogeny of reductive groups is a surjective homomorphism with kernel a finite central subgroup scheme. Every reductive group over a field admits a central isogeny from the product of a torus and some simple groups. For example, over any field &quot;k&quot;,
:formula_11

It is slightly awkward that the definition of a reductive group over a field involves passage to the algebraic closure. For a perfect field &quot;k&quot;, that can be avoided: a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is reductive if and only if every smooth connected unipotent normal &quot;k&quot;-subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is trivial. For an arbitrary field, the latter property defines a pseudo-reductive group, which is somewhat more general.

=== Split-reductive groups ===
A reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is called split if it contains a split maximal torus &quot;T&quot; over &quot;k&quot; (that is, a split torus in &quot;G&quot; whose base change to formula_8 is a maximal torus in formula_7). It is equivalent to say that &quot;T&quot; is a split torus in &quot;G&quot; that is maximal among all &quot;k&quot;-tori in &quot;G&quot;. These kinds of groups are useful because their classification can be described through combinatorical data called root data.

==Examples==

=== GL&quot;n&quot; and SL&quot;n&quot; ===
A fundamental example of a reductive group is the general linear group formula_14 of invertible &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over a field &quot;k&quot;, for a natural number &quot;n&quot;. In particular, the multiplicative group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; is the group &quot;GL&quot;(1), and so its group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of &quot;k&quot;-rational points is the group &quot;k&quot;* of nonzero elements of &quot;k&quot; under multiplication. Another reductive group is the special linear group &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over a field &quot;k&quot;, the subgroup of matrices with determinant 1. In fact, &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a simple algebraic group for &quot;n&quot; at least 2.

=== O(&quot;n&quot;), SO(&quot;n&quot;), and Sp(&quot;n&quot;) ===
An important simple group is the symplectic group &quot;Sp&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;) over a field &quot;k&quot;, the subgroup of &quot;GL&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;) that preserves a nondegenerate alternating bilinear form on the vector space &quot;k&quot;2&quot;n&quot;. Likewise, the orthogonal group &quot;O&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) is the subgroup of the general linear group that preserves a nondegenerate quadratic form &quot;q&quot; on a vector space over a field &quot;k&quot;. The algebraic group &quot;O&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) has two connected components, and its identity component &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) is reductive, in fact simple for &quot;q&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; at least 3. (For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic 2 and &quot;n&quot; odd, the group scheme &quot;O&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) is in fact connected but not smooth over &quot;k&quot;. The simple group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) can always be defined as the maximal smooth connected subgroup of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;.) When &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed, any two (nondegenerate) quadratic forms of the same dimension are isomorphic, and so it is reasonable to call this group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). For a general field &quot;k&quot;, different quadratic forms of dimension &quot;n&quot; can yield non-isomorphic simple groups &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;, although they all have the same base change to the algebraic closure formula_8.

=== Tori ===
The group formula_16 and products of it are called the algebraic tori. They are examples of reductive groups since they embed in formula_14 through the diagonal, and from this representation, their unipotent radical is trivial. For example, formula_18 embeds in formula_19 from the mapformula_20

=== Non-examples ===

* Any unipotent group is not reductive since its unipotent radical is itself. This includes the additive group formula_21.
* The Borel group formula_22 of formula_14 has a non-trivial unipotent radical formula_24 of upper-triangular matrices with formula_25 on the diagonal. This is an example of a non-reductive group which is not unipotent.

==== Associated reductive group ====
Note that the normality of the unipotent radical formula_5 implies that the quotient group formula_27 is reductive. For example,formula_28

==Other characterizations of reductive groups==
Every compact connected Lie group has a complexification, which is a complex reductive algebraic group. In fact, this construction gives a one-to-one correspondence between compact connected Lie groups and complex reductive groups, up to isomorphism. For a compact Lie group &quot;K&quot; with complexification &quot;G&quot;, the inclusion from &quot;K&quot; into the complex reductive group &quot;G&quot;(C) is a homotopy equivalence, with respect to the classical topology on &quot;G&quot;(C). For example, the inclusion from the unitary group &quot;U&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) to &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,C) is a homotopy equivalence.

For a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field of characteristic zero, all finite-dimensional representations of &quot;G&quot; (as an algebraic group) are completely reducible, that is, they are direct sums of irreducible representations. That is the source of the name &quot;reductive&quot;. Note, however, that complete reducibility fails for reductive groups in positive characteristic (apart from tori). In more detail: an affine group scheme &quot;G&quot; of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot; is called linearly reductive if its finite-dimensional representations are completely reducible. For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero, &quot;G&quot; is linearly reductive if and only if the identity component &quot;G&quot;o of &quot;G&quot; is reductive. For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic &quot;p&quot;&gt;0, however, Masayoshi Nagata showed that &quot;G&quot; is linearly reductive if and only if &quot;G&quot;o is of multiplicative type and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;o has order prime to &quot;p&quot;.

==Roots==
The classification of reductive algebraic groups is in terms of the associated root system, as in the theories of complex semisimple Lie algebras or compact Lie groups. Here is the way roots appear for reductive groups.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a split reductive group over a field &quot;k&quot;, and let &quot;T&quot; be a split maximal torus in &quot;G&quot;; so &quot;T&quot; is isomorphic to (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot; for some &quot;n&quot;, with &quot;n&quot; called the rank of &quot;G&quot;. Every representation of &quot;T&quot; (as an algebraic group) is a direct sum of 1-dimensional representations. A weight for &quot;G&quot; means an isomorphism class of 1-dimensional representations of &quot;T&quot;, or equivalently a homomorphism &quot;T&quot; → &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;. The weights form a group &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) under tensor product of representations, with &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) isomorphic to the product of &quot;n&quot; copies of the integers, Z&quot;n&quot;.

The adjoint representation is the action of &quot;G&quot; by conjugation on its Lie algebra formula_29. A root of &quot;G&quot; means a nonzero weight that occurs in the action of &quot;T&quot; ⊂ &quot;G&quot; on formula_29. The subspace of formula_29 corresponding to each root is 1-dimensional, and the subspace of formula_29 fixed by &quot;T&quot; is exactly the Lie algebra formula_33 of &quot;T&quot;. Therefore, the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; decomposes into formula_33 together with 1-dimensional subspaces indexed by the set Φ of roots:
:formula_35

For example, when &quot;G&quot; is the group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), its Lie algebra formula_36 is the vector space of all &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over &quot;k&quot;. Let &quot;T&quot; be the subgroup of diagonal matrices in &quot;G&quot;. Then the root-space decomposition expresses formula_36 as the direct sum of the diagonal matrices and the 1-dimensional subspaces indexed by the off-diagonal positions (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;). Writing &quot;L&quot;1...,&quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; for the standard basis for the weight lattice &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) ≅ Z&quot;n&quot;, the roots are the elements &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot; from 1 to &quot;n&quot;.

The roots of a semisimple group form a root system; this is a combinatorial structure which can be completely classified. More generally, the roots of a reductive group form a root datum, a slight variation. The Weyl group of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; means the quotient group of the normalizer of a maximal torus by the torus, &quot;W&quot; = &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)/&quot;T&quot;. The Weyl group is in fact a finite group generated by reflections. For example, for the group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (or &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), the Weyl group is the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

There are finitely many Borel subgroups containing a given maximal torus, and they are permuted simply transitively by the Weyl group (acting by conjugation). A choice of Borel subgroup determines a set of positive roots Φ+ ⊂ Φ, with the property that Φ is the disjoint union of Φ+ and −Φ+. Explicitly, the Lie algebra of &quot;B&quot; is the direct sum of the Lie algebra of &quot;T&quot; and the positive root spaces:
:formula_38
For example, if &quot;B&quot; is the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), then this is the obvious decomposition of the subspace formula_39 of upper-triangular matrices in formula_36. The positive roots are &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot; for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.

A simple root means a positive root that is not a sum of two other positive roots. Write Δ for the set of simple roots. The number &quot;r&quot; of simple roots is equal to the rank of the commutator subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, called the semisimple rank of &quot;G&quot; (which is simply the rank of &quot;G&quot; if &quot;G&quot; is semisimple). For example, the simple roots for &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (or &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) are &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; − 1.

Root systems are classified by the corresponding Dynkin diagram, which is a finite graph (with some edges directed or multiple). The set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram is the set of simple roots. In short, the Dynkin diagram describes the angles between the simple roots and their relative lengths, with respect to a Weyl group-invariant inner product on the weight lattice. The connected Dynkin diagrams (corresponding to simple groups) are pictured below.

For a split reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, an important point is that a root α determines not just a 1-dimensional subspace of the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;, but also a copy of the additive group &quot;G&quot;a in &quot;G&quot; with the given Lie algebra, called a root subgroup &quot;U&quot;α. The root subgroup is the unique copy of the additive group in &quot;G&quot; which is normalized by &quot;T&quot; and which has the given Lie algebra. The whole group &quot;G&quot; is generated (as an algebraic group) by &quot;T&quot; and the root subgroups, while the Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; is generated by &quot;T&quot; and the positive root subgroups. In fact, a split semisimple group &quot;G&quot; is generated by the root subgroups alone.

==Parabolic subgroups==
For a split reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the smooth connected subgroups of &quot;G&quot; that contain a given Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; of &quot;G&quot; are in one-to-one correspondence with the subsets of the set Δ of simple roots (or equivalently, the subsets of the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram). Let &quot;r&quot; be the order of Δ, the semisimple rank of &quot;G&quot;. Every parabolic subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is conjugate to a subgroup containing &quot;B&quot; by some element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). As a result, there are exactly 2&quot;r&quot; conjugacy classes of parabolic subgroups in &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot;. Explicitly, the parabolic subgroup corresponding to a given subset &quot;S&quot; of Δ is the group generated by &quot;B&quot; together with the root subgroups &quot;U&quot;−α for α in &quot;S&quot;. For example, the parabolic subgroups of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) that contain the Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; above are the groups of invertible matrices with zero entries below a given set of squares along the diagonal, such as:
:formula_41

By definition, a parabolic subgroup &quot;P&quot; of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is a smooth &quot;k&quot;-subgroup such that the quotient variety &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is proper over &quot;k&quot;, or equivalently projective over &quot;k&quot;. Thus the classification of parabolic subgroups amounts to a classification of the projective homogeneous varieties for &quot;G&quot; (with smooth stabilizer group; that is no restriction for &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero). For &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), these are the flag varieties, parametrizing sequences of linear subspaces of given dimensions &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; contained in a fixed vector space &quot;V&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot;:
:formula_42
For the orthogonal group or the symplectic group, the projective homogeneous varieties have a similar description as varieties of isotropic flags with respect to a given quadratic form or symplectic form. For any reductive group &quot;G&quot; with a Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot;, &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is called the flag variety or flag manifold of &quot;G&quot;.

==Classification of split reductive groups==
Chevalley showed in 1958 that the reductive groups over any algebraically closed field are classified up to isomorphism by root data. In particular, the semisimple groups over an algebraically closed field are classified up to central isogenies by their Dynkin diagram, and the simple groups correspond to the connected diagrams. Thus there are simple groups of types A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, E6, E7, E8, F4, G2. This result is essentially identical to the classifications of compact Lie groups or complex semisimple Lie algebras, by Wilhelm Killing and Élie Cartan in the 1880s and 1890s. In particular, the dimensions, centers, and other properties of the simple algebraic groups can be read from the list of simple Lie groups. It is remarkable that the classification of reductive groups is independent of the characteristic. For comparison, there are many more simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic than in characteristic zero.

The exceptional groups &quot;G&quot; of type G2 and E6 had been constructed earlier, at least in the form of the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), by L. E. Dickson. For example, the group &quot;G&quot;2 is the automorphism group of an octonion algebra over &quot;k&quot;. By contrast, the Chevalley groups of type F4, E7, E8 over a field of positive characteristic were completely new.

More generally, the classification of &quot;split&quot; reductive groups is the same over any field. A semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is called simply connected if every central isogeny from a semisimple group to &quot;G&quot; is an isomorphism. (For &quot;G&quot; semisimple over the complex numbers, being simply connected in this sense is equivalent to &quot;G&quot;(C) being simply connected in the classical topology.) Chevalley&#x27;s classification gives that, over any field &quot;k&quot;, there is a unique simply connected split semisimple group &quot;G&quot; with a given Dynkin diagram, with simple groups corresponding to the connected diagrams. At the other extreme, a semisimple group is of adjoint type if its center is trivial. The split semisimple groups over &quot;k&quot; with given Dynkin diagram are exactly the groups &quot;G&quot;/&quot;A&quot;, where &quot;G&quot; is the simply connected group and &quot;A&quot; is a &quot;k&quot;-subgroup scheme of the center of &quot;G&quot;.

For example, the simply connected split simple groups over a field &quot;k&quot; corresponding to the &quot;classical&quot; Dynkin diagrams are as follows:
*A&quot;n&quot;: &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1) over &quot;k&quot;;
*B&quot;n&quot;: the spin group Spin(2&quot;n&quot;+1) associated to a quadratic form of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;+1 over &quot;k&quot; with Witt index &quot;n&quot;, for example the form
::formula_43
*C&quot;n&quot;: the symplectic group &quot;Sp&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;;
*D&quot;n&quot;: the spin group Spin(2&quot;n&quot;) associated to a quadratic form of dimension 2&quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot; with Witt index &quot;n&quot;, which can be written as:
::formula_44

The outer automorphism group of a split reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the root datum of &quot;G&quot;. Moreover, the automorphism group of &quot;G&quot; splits as a semidirect product:
:formula_45
where &quot;Z&quot; is the center of &quot;G&quot;. For a split semisimple simply connected group &quot;G&quot; over a field, the outer automorphism group of &quot;G&quot; has a simpler description: it is the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot;.

==Reductive group schemes==
A group scheme &quot;G&quot; over a scheme &quot;S&quot; is called reductive if the morphism &quot;G&quot; → &quot;S&quot; is smooth and affine, and every geometric fiber formula_7 is reductive. (For a point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, the corresponding geometric fiber means the base change of &quot;G&quot; to an algebraic closure formula_8 of the residue field of &quot;p&quot;.) Extending Chevalley&#x27;s work, Michel Demazure and Grothendieck showed that pinned reductive group schemes over any nonempty scheme &quot;S&quot; are classified by root data. This statement includes the existence of Chevalley groups as group schemes over Z, and it says that every pinned reductive group over a scheme &quot;S&quot; is isomorphic to the base change of a Chevalley group from Z to &quot;S&quot;. A pinning of a split reductive group is a choice of root basis and also a choice of trivialisation of the one-dimensional additive group corresponding to each simple root. This statement is false without the pinning; for example, suppose that &quot;A&quot; is a Dedekind domain and that &quot;I&quot; is an ideal in &quot;A&quot; whose class in the class group of &quot;A&quot; is not a square. Then &quot;SL(A + I)&quot; and SL_2(A) are split and reductive over &quot;Spec A&quot; and have the same root data but they are not isomorphic: the flag scheme (the quotient by a Borel subgroup scheme) of the first is the projective line bundle P(A + I)&quot; and has no section with trivial normal bundle (a section corresponds to a short exact sequence &quot;0 → J → A + I → K → 0&quot; where &quot;J, K&quot; are ideal classes and the normal bundle is then &quot;J^{-1}K&quot;, which is not trivial since &quot;JK&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;I&quot;) while the flag scheme of the second is P^1_A&quot; and does possess sections with trivial normal bundle.

==Real reductive groups==
In the context of Lie groups rather than algebraic groups, a real reductive group is a Lie group &quot;G&quot; such that there is a linear algebraic group &quot;L&quot; over R whose identity component (in the Zariski topology) is reductive, and a homomorphism &quot;G&quot; → &quot;L&quot;(R) whose kernel is finite and whose image is open in &quot;L&quot;(R) (in the classical topology). It is also standard to assume that the image of the adjoint representation Ad(&quot;G&quot;) is contained in Int(&quot;g&quot;C) = Ad(&quot;L&quot;0(C)) (which is automatic for &quot;G&quot; connected).

In particular, every connected semisimple Lie group (meaning that its Lie algebra is semisimple) is reductive. Also, the Lie group R is reductive in this sense, since it can be viewed as the identity component of &quot;GL&quot;(1,R) ≅ R*. The problem of classifying the real reductive groups largely reduces to classifying the simple Lie groups. These are classified by their Satake diagram; or one can just refer to the list of simple Lie groups (up to finite coverings).

Useful theories of admissible representations and unitary representations have been developed for real reductive groups in this generality. The main differences between this definition and the definition of a reductive algebraic group have to do with the fact that an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over R may be connected as an algebraic group while the Lie group &quot;G&quot;(R) is not connected, and likewise for simply connected groups. 

For example, the projective linear group &quot;PGL&quot;(2) is connected as an algebraic group over any field, but its group of real points &quot;PGL&quot;(2,R) has two connected components. The identity component of &quot;PGL&quot;(2,R) (sometimes called &quot;PSL&quot;(2,R)) is a real reductive group that cannot be viewed as an algebraic group. Similarly, &quot;SL&quot;(2) is simply connected as an algebraic group over any field, but the Lie group &quot;SL&quot;(2,R) has fundamental group isomorphic to the integers Z, and so &quot;SL&quot;(2,R) has nontrivial covering spaces. By definition, all finite coverings of &quot;SL&quot;(2,R) (such as the metaplectic group) are real reductive groups. On the other hand, the universal cover of &quot;SL&quot;(2,R) is not a real reductive group, even though its Lie algebra is reductive, that is, the product of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra.

For a connected real reductive group &quot;G&quot;, the quotient manifold &quot;G&quot;/&quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot; by a maximal compact subgroup &quot;K&quot; is a symmetric space of non-compact type. In fact, every symmetric space of non-compact type arises this way. These are central examples in Riemannian geometry of manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvature. For example, &quot;SL&quot;(2,R)/&quot;SO&quot;(2) is the hyperbolic plane, and &quot;SL&quot;(2,C)/&quot;SU&quot;(2) is hyperbolic 3-space.

For a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation (such as the p-adic numbers Q&quot;p&quot;), the affine building &quot;X&quot; of &quot;G&quot; plays the role of the symmetric space. Namely, &quot;X&quot; is a simplicial complex with an action of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) preserves a CAT(0) metric on &quot;X&quot;, the analog of a metric with nonpositive curvature. The dimension of the affine building is the &quot;k&quot;-rank of &quot;G&quot;. For example, the building of &quot;SL&quot;(2,Q&quot;p&quot;) is a tree.

==Representations of reductive groups==
For a split reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; (as an algebraic group) are parametrized by the dominant weights, which are defined as the intersection of the weight lattice &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) ≅ Z&quot;n&quot; with a convex cone (a Weyl chamber) in R&quot;n&quot;. In particular, this parametrization is independent of the characteristic of &quot;k&quot;. In more detail, fix a split maximal torus and a Borel subgroup, &quot;T&quot; ⊂ &quot;B&quot; ⊂ &quot;G&quot;. Then &quot;B&quot; is the semidirect product of &quot;T&quot; with a smooth connected unipotent subgroup &quot;U&quot;. Define a highest weight vector in a representation &quot;V&quot; of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; to be a nonzero vector &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;B&quot; maps the line spanned by &quot;v&quot; into itself. Then &quot;B&quot; acts on that line through its quotient group &quot;T&quot;, by some element λ of the weight lattice &quot;X&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). Chevalley showed that every irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot; has a unique highest weight vector up to scalars; the corresponding &quot;highest weight&quot; λ is dominant; and every dominant weight λ is the highest weight of a unique irreducible representation &quot;L&quot;(λ) of &quot;G&quot;, up to isomorphism.

There remains the problem of describing the irreducible representation with given highest weight. For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero, there are essentially complete answers. For a dominant weight λ, define the Schur module ∇(λ) as the &quot;k&quot;-vector space of sections of the &quot;G&quot;-equivariant line bundle on the flag manifold &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; associated to λ; this is a representation of &quot;G&quot;. For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero, the Borel–Weil theorem says that the irreducible representation &quot;L&quot;(λ) is isomorphic to the Schur module ∇(λ). Furthermore, the Weyl character formula gives the character (and in particular the dimension) of this representation.

For a split reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; of positive characteristic, the situation is far more subtle, because representations of &quot;G&quot; are typically not direct sums of irreducibles. For a dominant weight λ, the irreducible representation &quot;L&quot;(λ) is the unique simple submodule (the socle) of the Schur module ∇(λ), but it need not be equal to the Schur module. The dimension and character of the Schur module are given by the Weyl character formula (as in characteristic zero), by George Kempf. The dimensions and characters of the irreducible representations &quot;L&quot;(λ) are in general unknown, although a large body of theory has been developed to analyze these representations. One important result is that the dimension and character of &quot;L&quot;(λ) are known when the characteristic &quot;p&quot; of &quot;k&quot; is much bigger than the Coxeter number of &quot;G&quot;, by Henning Andersen, Jens Jantzen, and Wolfgang Soergel (proving Lusztig&#x27;s conjecture in that case). Their character formula for &quot;p&quot; large is based on the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials, which are combinatorially complex. For any prime &quot;p&quot;, Simon Riche and Geordie Williamson conjectured the irreducible characters of a reductive group in terms of the &quot;p&quot;-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which are even more complex, but at least are computable.

==Non-split reductive groups==
As discussed above, the classification of split reductive groups is the same over any field. By contrast, the classification of arbitrary reductive groups can be hard, depending on the base field. Some examples among the classical groups are:
*Every nondegenerate quadratic form &quot;q&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; determines a reductive group G = &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;). Here &quot;G&quot; is simple if &quot;q&quot; has dimension &quot;n&quot; at least 3, since formula_7 is isomorphic to &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over an algebraic closure formula_8. The &quot;k&quot;-rank of &quot;G&quot; is equal to the Witt index of &quot;q&quot; (the maximum dimension of an isotropic subspace over &quot;k&quot;). So the simple group &quot;G&quot; is split over &quot;k&quot; if and only if &quot;q&quot; has the maximum possible Witt index, formula_50.
*Every central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over &quot;k&quot; determines a reductive group &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SL&quot;(1,&quot;A&quot;), the kernel of the reduced norm on the group of units &quot;A&quot;* (as an algebraic group over &quot;k&quot;). The degree of &quot;A&quot; means the square root of the dimension of &quot;A&quot; as a &quot;k&quot;-vector space. Here &quot;G&quot; is simple if &quot;A&quot; has degree &quot;n&quot; at least 2, since formula_7 is isomorphic to &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over formula_8. If &quot;A&quot; has index &quot;r&quot; (meaning that &quot;A&quot; is isomorphic to the matrix algebra &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;/&quot;r&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) for a division algebra &quot;D&quot; of degree &quot;r&quot; over &quot;k&quot;), then the &quot;k&quot;-rank of &quot;G&quot; is (&quot;n&quot;/&quot;r&quot;) − 1. So the simple group &quot;G&quot; is split over &quot;k&quot; if and only if &quot;A&quot; is a matrix algebra over &quot;k&quot;.

As a result, the problem of classifying reductive groups over &quot;k&quot; essentially includes the problem of classifying all quadratic forms over &quot;k&quot; or all central simple algebras over &quot;k&quot;. These problems are easy for &quot;k&quot; algebraically closed, and they are understood for some other fields such as number fields, but for arbitrary fields there are many open questions.

A reductive group over a field &quot;k&quot; is called isotropic if it has &quot;k&quot;-rank greater than 0 (that is, if it contains a nontrivial split torus), and otherwise anisotropic. For a semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the following conditions are equivalent:
*&quot;G&quot; is isotropic (that is, &quot;G&quot; contains a copy of the multiplicative group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; over &quot;k&quot;);
*&quot;G&quot; contains a parabolic subgroup over &quot;k&quot; not equal to &quot;G&quot;;
*&quot;G&quot; contains a copy of the additive group &quot;G&quot;&quot;a&quot; over &quot;k&quot;.
For &quot;k&quot; perfect, it is also equivalent to say that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) contains a unipotent element other than 1.

For a connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a local field &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero (such as the real numbers), the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is compact in the classical topology (based on the topology of &quot;k&quot;) if and only if &quot;G&quot; is reductive and anisotropic. Example: the orthogonal group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) over R has real rank min(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;), and so it is anisotropic if and only if &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; is zero.

A reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is called quasi-split if it contains a Borel subgroup over &quot;k&quot;. A split reductive group is quasi-split. If &quot;G&quot; is quasi-split over &quot;k&quot;, then any two Borel subgroups of &quot;G&quot; are conjugate by some element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). Example: the orthogonal group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;) over R is split if and only if |&quot;p&quot;−&quot;q&quot;| ≤ 1, and it is quasi-split if and only if |&quot;p&quot;−&quot;q&quot;| ≤ 2.

==Structure of semisimple groups as abstract groups==
For a simply connected split semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, Robert Steinberg gave an explicit presentation of the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). It is generated by copies of the additive group of &quot;k&quot; indexed by the roots of &quot;G&quot; (the root subgroups), with relations determined by the Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot;.

For a simply connected split semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over a perfect field &quot;k&quot;, Steinberg also determined the automorphism group of the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). Every automorphism is the product of an inner automorphism, a diagonal automorphism (meaning conjugation by a suitable formula_8-point of a maximal torus), a graph automorphism (corresponding to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram), and a field automorphism (coming from an automorphism of the field &quot;k&quot;).

For a &quot;k&quot;-simple algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, Tits&#x27;s simplicity theorem says that the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is close to being simple, under mild assumptions. Namely, suppose that &quot;G&quot; is isotropic over &quot;k&quot;, and suppose that the field &quot;k&quot; has at least 4 elements. Let &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)+ be the subgroup of the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) generated by &quot;k&quot;-points of copies of the additive group &quot;G&quot;&quot;a&quot; over &quot;k&quot; contained in &quot;G&quot;. (By the assumption that &quot;G&quot; is isotropic over &quot;k&quot;, the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)+ is nontrivial, and even Zariski dense in &quot;G&quot; if &quot;k&quot; is infinite.) Then the quotient group of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)+ by its center is simple (as an abstract group). The proof uses Jacques Tits&#x27;s machinery of BN-pairs.

The exceptions for fields of order 2 or 3 are well understood. For &quot;k&quot; = F2, Tits&#x27;s simplicity theorem remains valid except when &quot;G&quot; is split of type &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;2, or &quot;G&quot;2, or non-split (that is, unitary) of type &quot;A&quot;2. For &quot;k&quot; = F3, the theorem holds except for &quot;G&quot; of type &quot;A&quot;1.

For a &quot;k&quot;-simple group &quot;G&quot;, in order to understand the whole group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), one can consider the Whitehead group &quot;W&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;)=&quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)/&quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)+. For &quot;G&quot; simply connected and quasi-split, the Whitehead group is trivial, and so the whole group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is simple modulo its center. More generally, the Kneser–Tits problem asks for which isotropic &quot;k&quot;-simple groups the Whitehead group is trivial. In all known examples, &quot;W&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) is abelian.

For an anisotropic &quot;k&quot;-simple group &quot;G&quot;, the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) can be far from simple. For example, let &quot;D&quot; be a division algebra with center a &quot;p&quot;-adic field &quot;k&quot;. Suppose that the dimension of &quot;D&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is finite and greater than 1. Then &quot;G&quot; = &quot;SL&quot;(1,&quot;D&quot;) is an anisotropic &quot;k&quot;-simple group. As mentioned above, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is compact in the classical topology. Since it is also totally disconnected, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is a profinite group (but not finite). As a result, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) contains infinitely many normal subgroups of finite index.

==Lattices and arithmetic groups==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a linear algebraic group over the rational numbers Q. Then &quot;G&quot; can be extended to an affine group scheme &quot;G&quot; over Z, and this determines an abstract group &quot;G&quot;(Z). An arithmetic group means any subgroup of &quot;G&quot;(Q) that is commensurable with &quot;G&quot;(Z). (Arithmeticity of a subgroup of &quot;G&quot;(Q) is independent of the choice of Z-structure.) For example, &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,Z) is an arithmetic subgroup of &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,Q).

For a Lie group &quot;G&quot;, a lattice in &quot;G&quot; means a discrete subgroup Γ of &quot;G&quot; such that the manifold &quot;G&quot;/Γ has finite volume (with respect to a &quot;G&quot;-invariant measure). For example, a discrete subgroup Γ is a lattice if &quot;G&quot;/Γ is compact. The Margulis arithmeticity theorem says, in particular: for a simple Lie group &quot;G&quot; of real rank at least 2, every lattice in &quot;G&quot; is an arithmetic group.

==The Galois action on the Dynkin diagram==

In seeking to classify reductive groups which need not be split, one step is the Tits index, which reduces the problem to the case of anisotropic groups. This reduction generalizes several fundamental theorems in algebra. For example, Witt&#x27;s decomposition theorem says that a nondegenerate quadratic form over a field is determined up to isomorphism by its Witt index together with its anisotropic kernel. Likewise, the Artin–Wedderburn theorem reduces the classification of central simple algebras over a field to the case of division algebras. Generalizing these results, Tits showed that a reductive group over a field &quot;k&quot; is determined up to isomorphism by its Tits index together with its anisotropic kernel, an associated anisotropic semisimple &quot;k&quot;-group.

For a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the absolute Galois group Gal(&quot;k&quot;&quot;s&quot;/&quot;k&quot;) acts (continuously) on the &quot;absolute&quot; Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot;, that is, the Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot; over a separable closure &quot;k&quot;s (which is also the Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot; over an algebraic closure formula_54). The Tits index of &quot;G&quot; consists of the root datum of &quot;G&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;s&quot;, the Galois action on its Dynkin diagram, and a Galois-invariant subset of the vertices of the Dynkin diagram. Traditionally, the Tits index is drawn by circling the Galois orbits in the given subset.

There is a full classification of quasi-split groups in these terms. Namely, for each action of the absolute Galois group of a field &quot;k&quot; on a Dynkin diagram, there is a unique simply connected semisimple quasi-split group &quot;H&quot; over &quot;k&quot; with the given action. (For a quasi-split group, every Galois orbit in the Dynkin diagram is circled.) Moreover, any other simply connected semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; with the given action is an inner form of the quasi-split group &quot;H&quot;, meaning that &quot;G&quot; is the group associated to an element of the Galois cohomology set &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;), where &quot;Z&quot; is the center of &quot;H&quot;. In other words, &quot;G&quot; is the twist of &quot;H&quot; associated to some &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;-torsor over &quot;k&quot;, as discussed in the next section.

Example: Let &quot;q&quot; be a nondegenerate quadratic form of even dimension 2&quot;n&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; of characteristic not 2, with &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5. (These restrictions can be avoided.) Let &quot;G&quot; be the simple group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;. The absolute Dynkin diagram of &quot;G&quot; is of type D&quot;n&quot;, and so its automorphism group is of order 2, switching the two &quot;legs&quot; of the D&quot;n&quot; diagram. The action of the absolute Galois group of &quot;k&quot; on the Dynkin diagram is trivial if and only if the signed discriminant &quot;d&quot; of &quot;q&quot; in &quot;k&quot;*/(&quot;k&quot;*)2 is trivial. If &quot;d&quot; is nontrivial, then it is encoded in the Galois action on the Dynkin diagram: the index-2 subgroup of the Galois group that acts as the identity is formula_55. The group &quot;G&quot; is split if and only if &quot;q&quot; has Witt index &quot;n&quot;, the maximum possible, and &quot;G&quot; is quasi-split if and only if &quot;q&quot; has Witt index at least &quot;n&quot; − 1.

==Torsors and the Hasse principle==
A torsor for an affine group scheme &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; means an affine scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot; with an action of &quot;G&quot; such that formula_56 is isomorphic to formula_7 with the action of formula_7 on itself by left translation. A torsor can also be viewed as a principal G-bundle over &quot;k&quot; with respect to the fppf topology on &quot;k&quot;, or the étale topology if &quot;G&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot;. The pointed set of isomorphism classes of &quot;G&quot;-torsors over &quot;k&quot; is called &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;), in the language of Galois cohomology.

Torsors arise whenever one seeks to classify forms of a given algebraic object &quot;Y&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, meaning objects &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot; which become isomorphic to &quot;Y&quot; over the algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;. Namely, such forms (up to isomorphism) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,Aut(&quot;Y&quot;)). For example, (nondegenerate) quadratic forms of dimension &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot; are classified by &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), and central simple algebras of degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot; are classified by &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;PGL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). Also, &quot;k&quot;-forms of a given algebraic group &quot;G&quot; (sometimes called &quot;twists&quot; of &quot;G&quot;) are classified by &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,Aut(&quot;G&quot;)). These problems motivate the systematic study of &quot;G&quot;-torsors, especially for reductive groups &quot;G&quot;.

When possible, one hopes to classify &quot;G&quot;-torsors using cohomological invariants, which are invariants taking values in Galois cohomology with &quot;abelian&quot; coefficient groups &quot;M&quot;, &quot;H&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;M&quot;). In this direction, Steinberg proved Serre&#x27;s &quot;Conjecture I&quot;: for a connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a perfect field of cohomological dimension at most 1, &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) = 1. (The case of a finite field was known earlier, as Lang&#x27;s theorem.) It follows, for example, that every reductive group over a finite field is quasi-split.

Serre&#x27;s Conjecture II predicts that for a simply connected semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over a field of cohomological dimension at most 2, &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) = 1. The conjecture is known for a totally imaginary number field (which has cohomological dimension 2). More generally, for any number field &quot;k&quot;, Martin Kneser, Günter Harder and Vladimir Chernousov (1989) proved the Hasse principle: for a simply connected semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, the map
:formula_59
is bijective. Here &quot;v&quot; runs over all places of &quot;k&quot;, and &quot;k&quot;&quot;v&quot; is the corresponding local field (possibly R or C). Moreover, the pointed set &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;&quot;v&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) is trivial for every nonarchimidean local field &quot;k&quot;&quot;v&quot;, and so only the real places of &quot;k&quot; matter. The analogous result for a global field &quot;k&quot; of positive characteristic was proved earlier by Harder (1975): for every simply connected semisimple group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) is trivial (since &quot;k&quot; has no real places).

In the slightly different case of an adjoint group &quot;G&quot; over a number field &quot;k&quot;, the Hasse principle holds in a weaker form: the natural map
:formula_59
is injective. For &quot;G&quot; = &quot;PGL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), this amounts to the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem, saying that a central simple algebra over a number field is determined by its local invariants.

Building on the Hasse principle, the classification of semisimple groups over number fields is well understood. For example, there are exactly three Q-forms of the exceptional group E8, corresponding to the three real forms of E8.

<text>The term Cadillac V8 may refer to any of a number of V8 engines produced by the Cadillac division of General Motors since it pioneered the first such mass-produced engine in 1914.

Most commonly, such a reference is to one of the manufacturer&#x27;s most successful, best known, or longest-lived 90° V8 engine series. These include the pioneering overhead valve  cu in introduced in 1949, made in three displacements up to ; a  introduced in 1963 that grew to ; and a  introduced in 1968 and enlarged to . Also notable was the Northstar, which debuted in 1992 as a 4.6 litre, and was also produced in 4.4 L and 4.2 L versions.

When the Northstar engine series ended production in 2010, it became the last General Motors division to retain its own proprietary V8 design. This changed when Cadillac created the twin-turbo &quot;Blackwing&quot; engine in 2019.

==L-head==

The Type 51 was the first Cadillac V8. Introduced in 1914, it was the standard engine for 1915 Cadillac models. It was a 90° design with an L-head (sidevalve) configuration and was water-cooled. Bore and stroke was , for a total of of displacement. Output was .

This engine was designed under the leadership of Cadillac&#x27;s chief engineer (1914–1917), Scottish-born D (D&#x27;Orsay) McCall White (1880 -), later a vice president of Cadillac. Hired by Henry Leland for his V-engine expertise from his employment as chief engineer at Napier, and previously Daimler at Coventry, he was later to move to Nash with LaFayette. White was appointed to a committee of three to supervise the development of the V12 Liberty aircraft motor, that later contributed to cross town rival Lincoln Motor Company introducing the Lincoln L series much later in 1917.

The engine was refined for 1923 with a crossplane crankshaft that introduced the (now standard) 90° offset for each pair of cylinders which improved balance and smoothness. Power was up to .

The L-head was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines of the 20th century list.

L-head applications:
* Cadillac Type 51
* Cadillac Type 53
* Cadillac Type 55
* Cadillac Type 57
* Cadillac Type 59
* Cadillac Type 61
* Cadillac V-63
* Cadillac Series 341
* Oldsmobile Light Eight

Cadillac created a new V8, the &quot;341&quot;, for 1928. It was a engine and produced . The same year saw the introduction of the synchromesh transmission. This engine was used in the Series 341 and 341B cars of 1928 and 1929.

From 1930 through 1935, Cadillac produced a version with an increased displacement of . This used a bore and stroke. This engine was used in the Cadillac Series 353 and Series 355.

==Monobloc==
A &quot;monobloc engine&quot; was used in the 1936 Series 60. It was designed to be the company&#x27;s next-generation powerplant at reduced cost from the 353 and Cadillac V12. The monobloc&#x27;s cylinders and crankcase were cast as a single unit, and it used hydraulic valve lifters for durability. This design allowed the creation of the mid-priced Series 60 line.

Bore and stroke was . This engine was closely related to a monobloc design earlier introduced in the 1936–1948 engine, which was modified with a bore. This was used in the Series 60/60S/61/62/63/65/67 and 70/72/75. It was also used in a dual setup in tanks (e.g. M5 Stuart and the M24 Chaffee), in World War II mated to a Hydramatic transmission.

===LaSalle===
In 1937, the new monobloc flathead gained in Cadillac V-8 models to , while the LaSalle straight-8 of 1934–1936 that originated from Oldsmobile actually was replaced with the 1936 smaller version at . In 1941, the LaSalle nameplate was phased out along with the , and Cadillacs, all powered, were available with the new Hydramatic automatic transmission which debuted in Oldsmobile the previous year. These engines were produced through 1948.

==OHV==

===331 series===
For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each produced their V8 designs (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303). Both of the engines were overhead valve designs, pioneered by Buick. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a &quot;dry&quot; (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring the use of a tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter &quot;skirtless&quot; block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter &quot;flat back&quot; that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing at the front of the transmission.

Bore and stroke are for an overall displacement of . This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small &quot;bleeds&quot; instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker V8 for operation at higher engine speeds.

====365====
Displacement was increased to for 1956 by increasing the bore to while maintaining the stroke. For the three years that the 365 was made, the base versions had a single four-barrel carburetor. The 1956 version produced 285 horsepower. The 1957 version raised that base engine output to 300 horsepower, while the 1958 base version cranked out 310. Eldorados featured multi-carb engines in all 3 years. The Eldorado engines were also optional on all other Cadillacs. The 1958 Eldorado 3-2bbl version produced .

====390====
A longer, stroke pushed displacement to for 1959, yielding , while the Eldorado Tri-power reached .

===390 series===

For the 1963 model year, Cadillac redesigned its V8 engine, modernizing the tooling used in the production line while optimizing the engine&#x27;s design. Although it shared the same layout and architecture with the 1949-vintage engine, the revised engine had shorter connecting rods and was lower, narrower, and shorter. The accessories (water pump, power steering pump, distributor) mounted on a die-cast aluminum housing at the front of the engine for improved accessibility. An alternator replaced the former generator. The crankshaft was cored out to make it both lighter and stronger. The revised engine was lighter than its predecessor, for a total dry weight of .

The revised engine shared the same bore and stroke of its predecessor, for an unchanged displacement of . Power was unchanged at , as was torque at .

====429====
For 1964, the engine had a bore and stroke, raising displacement to . Power rose to and torque to . It also included its first emission control system, which was a positive crankcase ventilation unit. The 429 was used through the 1967 model year.

===472 series===
Cadillac introduced an all-new engine for 1968. Although the modernized 390 series engine was compact and light for its displacement and output, represented the limit of the original architecture&#x27;s expansion, and it had been surpassed by Chrysler&#x27;s 440 and Lincoln&#x27;s 462 and 460. Cadillac went bigger, with provision for even more expansion.

At introduction, the new engine had a bore and stroke for a displacement of . &quot;Extensively redesigned&quot; to ease maintenance, it used 10% fewer parts and 25% fewer gasketed joints as before. It delivered at 4400 rpm and a massive torque at just 3000 rpm. The new engine was about heavier than its predecessor. It was used through 1974. It was designed with potential for a displacement.

====500====

For 1970, Cadillac fitted a crankshaft with a stroke, increasing total displacement on the engine to . At its introduction it was rated at , SAE gross, and of torque. For 1971, compression was reduced from 10.0:1 to 8.5:1, the lowered compression ratio dropped the 500&#x27;s gross output from to , or in the new SAE net ratings. By 1976, its final year, it had fallen to . However, a new Bendix electronic fuel injection system was offered as an option, and it increased power output to . The 500 was exclusive to the Eldorado until 1975 where the powerplant was standard in all Cadillacs except for the Seville, which was powered by a fuel-injected Oldsmobile 350.

===425 series===
Starting in the mid to late 1970s, Cadillac expanded its product range, offering more mid-sized vehicles. For example, while the Cadillac Seville initially used a variant of the Oldsmobile V8, Cadillac also began work on its own proprietary engines.

In 1977, Cadillac introduced a new V8, based on the architecture of the 472, but with a smaller, bore and the same stroke. The new engine was also lighter.

The 425 was offered in L33 form, with a four-barrel carburetor, producing at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm, and L35 with electronic multi-port fuel injection for and of torque, but peaked at 2400 rpm.

The 425 was used through 1979 on all Cadillacs except the Seville and 1979 Eldorados.

====368====
In 1980, the 425 was replaced with the L61, which was the same basic 472 family engine de-bored to but retaining the 472 and 425 engines&#x27; stroke for a total displacement of . The reduction in displacement was largely an effort to meet CAFE requirements for fuel economy. Throttle-body fuel injection was now standard on Eldorado and Seville when equipped with the 368. Rear-wheel-drive cars and the Commercial Chassis for hearse and ambulance builders used the Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor.

Cadillac referred to this new TBI (throttle-body fuel injection) system as Digital Fuel Injection (DFI); this particular induction system was later adopted by other GM divisions, except on Oldsmobile V8s, and was used well into the mid-1990s on GM trucks.

Power output dropped to at 3600 rpm and torque to at 2000 rpm in DEFI forms as used on the front-wheel-drive Seville and Eldorado but on the four-barrel Quadrajet-equipped RWD models. This engine was standard on all Cadillacs except the redesigned Seville, in which it was optional.

====V8-6-4====

For 1981, Cadillac introduced a new engine that would become notorious for its unreliable electronics, the V8-6-4 (L62). The L61 had not provided a significant improvement in the company&#x27;s CAFE numbers, so Cadillac and Eaton Corporation devised a cylinder deactivation system called Modulated Displacement that would shut off two or four cylinders in low-load conditions such as highway cruising, then reactivate them when more power was needed. When deactivated, solenoids mounted to those cylinders&#x27; rocker arm studs would disengage the fulcrums, allowing the rockers to &quot;float&quot; and leave the valves closed despite the continued action of the pushrods. These engines are easily identified by their rocker covers, which each have elevated sections over two cylinders with electrical connectors on top. With the valves closed, the cylinders acted as air springs, which both eliminated the feel of &quot;missing&quot; and kept the cylinders warm for instant combustion upon reactivation. Simultaneously, the engine control module would reduce the amount of fuel metered through the TBI unit. On the dashboard, an &quot;MPG Sentinel&quot; digital display could show the number of cylinders in operation, average or current fuel consumption (in miles per gallon), or estimated range based on the amount of fuel remaining in the tank and the average efficiency since the last reset.

Another rare and advanced feature introduced with DFI was Cadillac&#x27;s truly &quot;on-board&quot; diagnostics. For mechanics who had to deal with the 368s, the cars contained diagnostics that did not require the use of special external computer scan tools. The new electronic climate control display, along with the MPG Sentinel, provided on-board readout of any stored trouble codes, instantaneous readings from all the various engine sensors, forced cycling of the underhood solenoids and motors, and on the V8-6-4 engines, manual cylinder-pair control. The L62 produced at 3800 rpm and at 1400 rpm. Cadillac hailed the L62 as a technological masterpiece, and made it standard equipment across the whole Cadillac line.

While cylinder deactivation would make a comeback some 20 years later with modern computing power (and using oil pressure to deactivate the valves by collapsing the lifters), Cadillac&#x27;s 1981 V8-6-4 proved to have insurmountable engineering problems. The main issue was that the engine control module simply lacked the robustness, programming and processing speed to efficiently manage the cylinder-deactivation under all load conditions. In the era before electronically operated EGR valves, the engineers also made an error in using a back-pressure-type EGR valve. While this early effort to match the vacuum-controlled EGR volume more accurately to the engine&#x27;s load made sense in a conventional engine, it had the effect of causing pinging (detonation) problems in the V8-6-4 engine, because four cylinders operating under higher load needed more EGR, while they were actually producing less exhaust flow and therefore less back-pressure to operate the valve.

In an effort to increase reliability, Cadillac issued thirteen updated PROM chips for the ECMs, but many of these engines simply had their Modulated Displacement function disabled by dealers, leaving them with permanent eight-cylinder operation. This was accomplished by merely disconnecting a single wire from the transmission&#x27;s &quot;3rd-gear switch&quot;, or running it through a switch inside the car for manual override. The 368 was dropped from most Cadillac passenger cars after the 1981 model year, although the V8-6-4 remained the standard engine for Fleetwood Limousines and the carbureted 368 remained in the Commercial Chassis through 1984.

The 368 has the distinction of being the last traditional &quot;big-block&quot; cast-iron pushrod V8 engine available in a production car. It lasted through 1984 in the limousines. Rival big blocks, ranging in displacement from 396 to 460 cubic inches, disappeared between 1976 and 1978. RWD models were coupled with the heavy-duty THM400 transmission, the last factory-produced GM passenger car fitted with this transmission.

GM reintroduced an updated fuel management system in 2005, marketed as Active Fuel Management or &quot;Displacement on Demand&quot;.

==Cadillac High Technology engine==
The OHV Cadillac High Technology engine was produced from 1982 to 1995 in displacements of , , and .

==Northstar==

Cadillac&#x27;s DOHC, four-valve-per-cylinder Northstar debuted in 1992, which at the time was its most technologically advanced engine.

Although Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Buick have borrowed the Northstar architecture for their V8 (and even V6) engines, it was not until the 2004 Pontiac Bonneville that a non-Cadillac used the Northstar name.

The Northstar has been produced in , , and versions.

===4.6 L===
The version was available starting in 1993 on the Seville SLS and Eldorado ESC. The Allanté, the Seville STS, and the Eldorado ETC had the version of the Northstar. In 1994, the DeVille Concours received the version of this engine. By 1996, the Northstar engine became standard equipment in the front-wheel-drive Cadillac line. The engine was in the Seville SLS 1993–2004, Eldorado ESC 1993–2002, Standard Deville 1996–2005, Devile d&#x27;elegance 1997–1999, and Deville DHS 2000–2005. The version was used in the Seville STS 1993–2004, Eldorado ETC 1996–2002, Deville Concours 1997–1999, and Deville DTS 2000–2005. Its final appearance was in the final generation of the DTS series, produced from 2006 to 2011.

The version of the Northstar was also standard equipment in the top GXP trim level of the Pontiac Bonneville, produced only in 2004 and 2005. It was also the top engine option available in the Buick Lucerne CXS and a NHP (Northstar High Output) version in the Buick Lucerne Super, produced from 2006 through 2011. The Lucerne shared its platform and the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant with the final generation of the Cadillac DTS.

===4.4 L===
The versions were all supercharged, exclusive to Cadillac&#x27;s V-series. The STS-V engine, produces and under the SAE certified rating system.

The 2006 - 2008 XLR-V uses the same supercharged Northstar V8 as the STS-V, though output is down somewhat due to design changes made to accommodate the model&#x27;s more limited underhood space. For the XLR-V, the SAE certified output is and . The supercharger and four intercoolers are built into the intake manifold.

The bores were reduced in size to increase block strength, increasing the safety margin under boost.

==Cadillac use of non-Cadillac V8s==

===RWD Fleetwood, Deville, and Brougham===
The engine in the 1976–1979 Seville was &quot;marketed&quot; as a Cadillac engine and was exclusive to the Cadillac product line, but was in reality produced by the Oldsmobile division. Buyers were able to choose between 350 gasoline and 350 diesel versions. From 1982 to 1985, all rear-wheel-drive Cadillacs (except for the limousines) could be ordered with the Oldsmobile LF9 Diesel V8. In fact, for most of its life, the 1980–1985 version of Cadillac&#x27;s Seville came standard with Oldsmobile&#x27;s V8 diesel, with the gasoline engine being a no-cost option.

From 1986 to 1990, the rear-wheel-drive Cadillac Brougham used a carbureted Oldsmobile V8 (replacing the Cadillac HT-4100). In 1990, a , fuel-injected small-block Chevrolet L05 V8 was available for Brougham models equipped with the towing package. In 1991, the Oldsmobile 307 was replaced with a throttle body fuel-injected small-block Chevrolet L03 V8, which was also found in Chevrolet&#x27;s Caprice, C/K light trucks, and G-series vans. In 1993, the L05 V8 became standard in the newly-renamed Cadillac Fleetwood. In 1994, the L05 was replaced with an iron-headed small-block Chevrolet Corvette LT1 V8 with , which the Fleetwood used until discontinued at the end of the 1996 model year.

=== Escalade ===
With the introduction of the Escalade to the Cadillac lineup, the small-block Chevrolet L31 V8 (Vortec 5700) was used, as it was part of the C/K truck line on which the Escalade was based. In 2001, the newly-redesigned 2002 Escalade used the performance version of the 6.0 L Generation III series engine (RPO code LQ9), although the regular length 2002–2005 Escalade 2WD used the 5.3-liter LM7 version of the Generation III series engine. From 2007 to 2014, all Cadillac Escalades were equipped with the Generation IV 6.2L engine, which was also used in the GMC Yukon Denali, while hybrid models used a 6.0-liter version of the Generation IV series engine. Since 2015, gasoline-powered Escalades have used the Generation V 6.2L engine, with the Escalade-V using a supercharged version known as the LT4.

===CTS-V===
The 2004 and 2005 Cadillac CTS-V used the previous-generation corvette c6&#x27;s 5.7 L LS6 Gen III V8. The 2006 and 2007 CTS-V used the 6.0 L LS2 Gen IV V8, similar to that used in the standard Corvette C6. The 2009–2015 CTS-V carried a supercharged 6.2 L LSA variant of the Gen IV V8, producing an SAE-certified , while the 2016–2019 model carried a supercharged 6.2 L LT4 with .

===CT5-V Blackwing===
The 2022–present Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing carries a supercharged 6.2 L LT4 variant of the Gen V series engine, producing , the most powerful Cadillac sedan in history.

==Cadillac 4.2L twin-turbo V8 LTA engine==

The 4.2-liter V8 engine (GM RPO code LTA) is an eight-cylinder, dual overhead cam (DOHC) twin turbo engine produced by General Motors specifically for use in Cadillac luxury vehicles. The engine is the result of a new clean-sheet engine design as well as Cadillac&#x27;s first twin-turbo V8 engine. It first launched with the 2019 Cadillac CT6.

From the 1950s through the 1970s, each GM division had its own V8 engine family. Some were shared among other divisions, but each respective design was engineered and developed by its own division:
* Buick V8 engine
* GMC V8 engine
* Chevrolet small-block engine (first- and second-generation)
* Chevrolet big-block engine
* Oldsmobile V8 engine
* Pontiac V8 engine
* Holden V8 engine

GM later standardized on the later generations of the Chevrolet design:
* General Motors LS-based small-block engine
* List of GM engines

<doc id="1088411" wikidata="Q7581636" url="?curid=1088411" title="Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx">
<text>Spuyten Duyvil (, ) is a neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. It is bounded on the north by Riverdale, on the east by Kingsbridge, on the south by the Harlem River, and on the west by the Hudson River, although some consider it to be the southernmost part of Riverdale.

==Etymology==
The area is named after Spuyten Duyvil Creek. &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; may be literally translated as &quot;Spouting Devil&quot; or &quot;Spuitende Duivel&quot; in Dutch, a reference to the strong and wild tidal currents found at that location. It may also be translated as &quot;Spewing Devil&quot; or &quot;Spinning Devil&quot;, or more loosely as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot; or &quot;Devil&#x27;s Spate.&quot; &quot;Spui&quot; is a Dutch word involving outlets for water. Historian Reginald Pelham Bolton, however, argues that the phrase means &quot;spouting meadow&quot;, referring to a fresh-water spring at Inwood Hill.

An additional translation, &quot;to spite the Devil&quot; or &quot;in spite of the devil&quot;, was popularized by a story in Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;A Knickerbocker&#x27;s History of New York&quot; published in 1809. Set in the 1660s, the story tells of trumpeter Antony Van Corlear summoned by &quot;Peter de Groodt&quot; to warn settlers of an attempted British invasion, with Corlear attempting to swim across the &quot;Harlean river&quot; from Fort Amsterdam to the Bronx mainland &quot;in spite of the devil (spyt den duyvel)&quot;, Irving writes. The treacherous current pulled him under and he lost his life. This resulted in the name &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; for &quot;the adjoining promontory, which projects into the Hudson.&quot;

An extensive appendix to &quot;Studies in Etymology and Etiology&quot; (2009) by David L. Gold, which includes commentary by Rob Rentenaar, professor of onomastics at the University of Amsterdam, goes into great detail about all the various translations for &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; which have been mooted over the years. Rentenaar concludes that &quot;Duyvil&quot; means &quot;devil&quot;, either literally or in a transferred sense, but he could not determine what the intended meaning of &quot;Spuyten&quot; was because of the many variants that have been used throughout history.

The creek was referred to as &quot;Shorakapok&quot; by Lenape Native Americans in the area, translated as &quot;the sitting-down place&quot; or &quot;the place between the ridges&quot;.

==History==

In the late 17th century, Frederick Philipse, the lord of Philipse Manor in Westchester County, received permission to construct a bridge across Spuyten Duyvil Creek and charge tolls. &quot;King&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, which was located roughly south of and parallel to where West 230th Street lies today, opened in 1693.

Development of the neighborhood began in the latter half of the 19th century once the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad came through. The tracks originally crossed Spuyten Duyvil Creek and into Manhattan on the west side, but Cornelius Vanderbilt wanted to consolidate his railroad operations into one terminal, so he had tracks laid along the north side of the Harlem River so that trains coming south from Albany could join with the Harlem and New Haven lines and come into Manhattan down Fourth Avenue into his new Grand Central Depot. This is the route still used by Metro-North today.

Through the 1920s development of the Spuyten Duyvil neighborhood continued. Large high-rise apartment buildings, which later became condominiums and cooperatives, began to be built in the 1950s and continued through the 1980s, bringing in affluent families attracted by its scenic qualities, as well as by the area&#x27;s closeness to desirable neighborhoods such as Fieldston and Riverdale.

On July 18, 2013, a freight train derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station due to an excessively wide gauge at one point. No one was killed or injured. Less than six months later, on December 1, a commuter train derailment near the Spuyten Duyvil station resulted in 4 deaths and over 70 injuries, 11 of them critical. The cause of the second derailment was determined to be excessive speed.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Kingsbridge and Spuyten Duyvil was 30,161, a change of 289 (1%) from the 29,872 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhoods were 49.3% (14,872) White, 8.9% (2,691) African American, 0.1% (40) Native American, 5.7% (1,731) Asian, 0% (15) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (98) from other races, and 1.7% (510) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.8% (10,204) of the population.

A restaurant guide once described the neighborhood as &quot;upper middle class&quot;.

==Police and crime==
Spuyten Duyvil is patrolled by the 50th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 3450 Kingsbridge Avenue. The 50th Precinct ranked 13th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

The 50th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 69.9% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported three murders, 22 rapes, 185 robberies, 213 felony assaults, 126 burglaries, 695 grand larcenies, and 288 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

==Library==
The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Spuyten Duyvil branch at 650 West 235th Street. The one-story branch opened in 1971 and was designed by Giorgio Cavaglieri.

==Transportation==
Spuyten Duyvil is the location of the Spuyten Duyvil train station, which is served by the Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad, providing service into Grand Central Terminal and north into Westchester County. Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, a railroad swing bridge that carries Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Corridor line between New York City and Albany, spans Spuyten Duyvil Creek. The north end of the Henry Hudson Bridge connects the neighborhood to the island of Manhattan via the Henry Hudson Parkway.

Hudson Rail Link connects the Metro-North station to the surrounding area, with Routes J, K, L, and M serving Spuyten Duyvil.

<doc id="1088412" wikidata="Q901405" url="?curid=1088412" title="RollerCoaster Tycoon 3">
<text>RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a 2004 construction and management simulation video game. It is the third installment in the &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; series, and was developed by Frontier Developments and published by Atari Interactive. &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; places players in charge of managing amusement parks; rides can be built or demolished, terrain and scenery can be adjusted, and prices can be controlled to keep visitors happy.

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; features two methods of gameplay. In career mode, players must complete predetermined objectives in predesigned scenarios. In the newly added sandbox mode, players have unlimited time and money to create their own custom parks and rides. Features introduced in the series include the ability to import and export custom attractions, design custom scenarios and peeps, as well as design an in-game roller coaster and a fully three-dimensional world players can view from all angles.

In 2016, publisher Atari continued the series with its fourth main installment, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon World&quot;, to largely negative reception. The same year, Frontier developed and released &quot;Planet Coaster&quot;, a spiritual successor to the &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; series, which received considerably better reviews.

==Gameplay==

Like the previous games in the series, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; is a strategy and simulation game in which players manage all aspects of an amusement park by building or removing the rides, scenery and amenities, placing shops and facilities, adjusting the park&#x27;s finances, hiring staff, and keeping the park visitors, known as &quot;peeps&quot;, happy. &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; features two main game modes. The career mode features scenarios where players must accomplish goals, such as impressing a visiting celebrity or attaining a certain park rating. Each scenario has three levels of objectives, which are ranked as Apprentice, Entrepreneur, and Tycoon; the higher the level, the more challenging the goal is to complete. A third of the scenarios are playable from the start, with the rest unlocked when the player completes the objectives at each level. The second mode of play is the sandbox mode. In sandbox mode, players are given a large, empty plot of land and unlimited funds with which to build their own custom parks. However, the land given in this mode is limited as it cannot be expanded.

&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; introduces gameplay features in the series such as the CoasterCam, which allows players to &quot;ride&quot; roller coasters and other rides, and the MixMaster, which allows the player to coordinate firework shows and time them to in-game music. Unlike the two previous versions of the game, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, the guests, called &quot;peeps&quot;, arrive in groups and show variation in gender and age, including children, teenagers and adults. A day/night cycle changes the demographics of the park&#x27;s peeps; rides at night appeal to teenagers, while the daytime attracts families with children. Peeps can be harmed and injured by crashing vehicles, but will never die as they did in the previous titles, and if placed in water they will swim out. When cars derail from the tracks, they explode after a short period, whereas in the older games, they exploded on contact. Furthermore, a feature was added in which, after a cheat code was entered, people could utilize the Peep Cam from which they could see the park through a peeps&#x27; eyes. Parks now have opening and closing times, and the time of day is displayed. Scenery is divided into themes to customize parks, with western-, spooky-, science fiction-, prehistoric-, tropic (Paradise Island)- atlantis- and adventure-themed pieces. Another feature is the ability to import coasters from previous games in the series into &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;.
The game uses full 3D graphics instead of the isometric viewpoint of the previous games; this means that players can rotate and zoom the view of the park to any degree. However, there is an option to fix the camera&#x27;s rotation to a preset angle, as in the previous games. 3D land shaping is also available for creating mountains and hills inside the park, as well as the ability to change portions of the land into water.

==Development==
Although the core features of &quot;Roller Coaster Tycoon 3&quot; are based on the previous games, Chris Sawyer, the developer of the first two games, acted only as a consultant, as the game was instead developed by Frontier Developments, since Sawyer was developing &quot;Chris Sawyer&#x27;s Locomotion&quot; at the time. It is powered by the Cobra engine.

===Expansion packs===
Two expansion packs for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; were released – &quot;Soaked!&quot; and &quot;Wild!&quot;. A bundle, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Gold&quot;, was also released, including the original game and the &quot;Soaked!&quot; expansion pack; this was followed by &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum&quot; (Deluxe for the EU version of the game), including both expansion packs and the original game. &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum&quot; is available for Windows and Mac OS X. The game was also published by Aspyr Inc. on the Mac App Store in 2012.

&quot;Soaked!&quot;, the first expansion, allows the player to build water parks, which include swimming pools, water slides and underwater aquariums, while adding more rides and scenery to the original game such as the ability to create waterfalls. Using the MixMaster feature, the expansion pack also allows players to make their own water-jet displays and co-ordinate them to music. &quot;Soaked!&quot; received an average rating of 79 on Metacritic.

&quot;Wild!&quot;, the second expansion, allows the player to build zoos and safari rides, similar to Zoo Tycoon in an amusement park setting, in which animals can be placed, and adds more ride types and scenery to the original game. Additionally, it addressed several criticisms of the first game, such as the inability to build underground, which is available without the expansion pack in the form of an update patch. &quot;Wild!&quot; received an average rating of 71 on Metacritic.

Frontier released an iOS port of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; on August 12, 2015.

===Subsequent lawsuits and Complete Edition===
The original series&#x27; creator Chris Sawyer sued Atari in 2005 for allegedly breaching the terms of a licensing agreement by not allowing auditors access to accounts from 1999 to 2001, during which he claimed he was owed US$4.8 million. Atari counter-claimed in 2007 by claiming that Sawyer broke an agreement by signing a license-agreement with developer Frontier Developments, allowing them to create a demo for console platforms based on assets and mechanics from &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;. It was claimed by Atari that this induced Frontier to breach its contractual obligations to Atari by allowing Frontier to market and/or elicit funding for Thrillville through this demo. According to Atari, without this demo, Frontier would not have been able to create Thrillville independently from Atari. The lawsuit ended with an out of court settlement.

Frontier later sued Atari in January 2017 for underpaid royalties for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;. When Atari filed for bankruptcy in 2013, Frontier modified its contract for how future royalties would be paid. Atari has paid Frontier $1.17 million to date for &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, but Frontier observed from Steam Spy that sales of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; were much larger than Atari claimed, and under the new contract, Frontier would be owed an additional $2.2 million. Frontier sought to have rights to audit Atari&#x27;s records and claim the additional royalties it is owed. Frontier&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer David Walsh confirmed the report in statements to &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;, stating that they had previously attempted to resolve the issue without legal action since April 2016. Later in May 2018, the game was pulled from both Steam and GOG due to &quot;expiring rights&quot;.

While no resolution of the case has been publicly stated, Frontier announced the release of a self-published version of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, named &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Complete Edition&quot;. Like &quot;Platinum&quot; / &quot;Deluxe&quot;, this release includes both &quot;Soaked!&quot; and &quot;Wild!&quot; expansions. Additions included in the &quot;Complete Edition&quot; were to update the game to run on more modern computers, an adjustment in aspect ratios, and the removal of all references to the game&#x27;s previous publisher - Atari. Alongside this updated computer version, a console port for the Nintendo Switch was also created. The &quot;Complete Edition&quot; was released on September 24, 2020, to Steam, Epic Games Store, and Nintendo eShop. In March 2024, Limited Run Games announced a physical version of the Switch release of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Complete Edition&quot;. On the Mac App Store, the version published by Aspyr Inc. was updated to the &quot;Complete Edition&quot;.

On 15 March 2024, Frontier sold the publishing rights to the game back to Atari, Inc. for seven million dollars. In a trading update published by the London Stock Exchange on 2 April, it was reported that Frontier made $1.5 million a year from their sales of &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Complete Edition&quot; on all platforms. This was confirmed by their parent Atari SA on 2 April. Anticipating the 25th anniversary of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, Atari SA CEO Wade Rosen said &quot;I am really pleased that we can unite this important and successful title in the series with the rest of the franchise&quot;.

On 18 February 2025, Atari and Frontier Developments announced that the Complete Edition would be released for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S consoles on 20 March.

==Reception==
===Release===
&quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; received mostly positive reviews. The game has an average rating of 81/100 at Metacritic and 84% at GameRankings.
Publications such as &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; were overall positive about the game citing its many new features. However, fans of the first two games in the series tended to be more critical. Several other criticisms stemmed from bugs and technical issues, such as the game crashing, the camera freezing, staff getting stuck on railings, low framerates and graphical glitches mainly caused when adjusting the landscape.

The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; as their 2004 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year (General)&quot;, although it lost to &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. They wrote that it &quot;overcame the series&#x27; sophomore slump with a great state-of-the-art design.&quot; During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; for &quot;Simulation Game of the Year&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to &quot;The Sims 2&quot;.

===Sales===
On the week of November 7, 2004, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; was the second best-selling PC game on Amazon.com. Within the next week, the game became the best-selling PC game on Amazon.com. According to The NPD Group, &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot; was the ninth-best-selling computer game of 2004. It claimed fifth place on NPD&#x27;s annual chart for the following year. The game also received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

In June 2015, Frontier CEO David Braben reported that the game had sold &quot;more than 10 million copies&quot;.

<doc id="1088425" wikidata="Q6734205" url="?curid=1088425" title="Mahler measure">
<text>In mathematics, the Mahler measure formula_1 of a [[polynomial]] formula_2 with complex coefficients is defined as

formula_3
where formula_2 factorizes over the complex numbers formula_5 as
formula_6

The Mahler measure can be viewed as a kind of height function. Using Jensen&#x27;s formula, it can be proved that this measure is also equal to the geometric mean of formula_7 for formula_8 on the unit circle (i.e., formula_9):
formula_10

By extension, the Mahler measure of an [[algebraic number]] formula_11 is defined as the Mahler measure of the minimal polynomial of formula_11 over formula_13. In particular, if formula_11 is a Pisot number or a Salem number, then its Mahler measure is simply formula_11.

The Mahler measure is named after the German-born Australian mathematician Kurt Mahler.

== Properties ==

* The Mahler measure is multiplicative: formula_16
* formula_17 where formula_18 is the formula_19 norm of formula_20.
* Kronecker&#x27;s Theorem: If formula_20 is an irreducible monic integer polynomial with formula_22, then either formula_23 or formula_20 is a cyclotomic polynomial.
* &quot;(Lehmer&#x27;s conjecture)&quot; There is a constant formula_25 such that if formula_20 is an irreducible integer polynomial, then either formula_27 or formula_28.
* The Mahler measure of a monic integer polynomial is a Perron number.

== Higher-dimensional Mahler measure ==

The Mahler measure formula_1 of a multi-variable polynomial formula_30 is defined similarly by the formula

formula_31
It inherits the above three properties of the Mahler measure for a one-variable polynomial.

The multi-variable Mahler measure has been shown, in some cases, to be related to special values
of zeta-functions and formula_32-functions. For example, in 1981, Smyth proved the formulas
formula_33
where formula_34 is a Dirichlet L-function, and
formula_35
where formula_36 is the Riemann zeta function. Here formula_37 is called the &quot;logarithmic Mahler measure&quot;.

===Some results by Lawton and Boyd===

From the definition, the Mahler measure is viewed as the integrated values of polynomials over the torus (also see Lehmer&#x27;s conjecture). If formula_20 vanishes on the torus formula_39, then the convergence of the integral defining formula_1 is not obvious, but it is known that formula_1 does converge and is equal to a limit of one-variable Mahler measures, which had been conjectured by Boyd.

This is formulated as follows: Let formula_42 denote the integers and define formula_43 . If formula_44 is a polynomial in formula_45 variables and formula_46 define the polynomial formula_47 of one variable by

formula_48

and define formula_49 by
formula_50

where formula_51.

===Boyd&#x27;s proposal===

Boyd provided more general statements than the above theorem. He pointed out that the classical Kronecker&#x27;s theorem, which characterizes monic polynomials with integer coefficients all of whose roots are inside the unit disk, can be regarded as characterizing those polynomials of one variable whose measure is exactly 1, and that this result extends to polynomials in several variables.

Define an &quot;extended cyclotomic polynomial&quot; to be a polynomial of the form
formula_52
where formula_53 is the &quot;m&quot;-th cyclotomic polynomial, the formula_54 are integers, and the formula_55 are chosen minimally so that formula_56 is a polynomial in the formula_57. Let formula_58 be the set of polynomials that are products of monomials formula_59 and extended cyclotomic polynomials.

This led Boyd to consider the set of values
formula_60
and the union formula_61. He made the far-reaching conjecture that the set of formula_62 is a closed subset of formula_63. An immediate consequence of this conjecture would be the truth of Lehmer&#x27;s conjecture, albeit without an explicit lower bound. As Smyth&#x27;s result suggests that formula_64 , Boyd further conjectures that
formula_65

=== Mahler measure and entropy ===
An action formula_66 of formula_67 by automorphisms of a compact metrizable abelian group may be associated via duality to any countable module formula_45 over the ring formula_69. The topological entropy (which is equal to the measure-theoretic entropy) of this action, formula_70, is given by a Mahler measure (or is infinite). In the case of a cyclic module formula_71 for a non-zero polynomial formula_72 the formula proved by Lind, Schmidt, and Ward gives formula_73, the logarithmic Mahler measure of formula_74. In the general case, the entropy of the action is expressed as a sum of logarithmic Mahler measures over the generators of the principal associated prime ideals of the module. As pointed out earlier by Lind in the case formula_75 of a single compact group automorphism, this means that the set of possible values of the entropy of such actions is either all of formula_76 or a countable set depending on the solution to Lehmer&#x27;s problem. Lind also showed that the infinite-dimensional torus formula_77 either has ergodic automorphisms of finite positive entropy or only has automorphisms of infinite entropy depending on the solution to Lehmer&#x27;s problem.

<doc id="1088440" wikidata="Q131793" url="?curid=1088440" title="Maniraptora">
<text>Maniraptora is a clade of coelurosaurian dinosaurs which includes the birds and the non-avian dinosaurs that were more closely related to them than to &quot;Ornithomimus velox&quot;. It contains the major subgroups Avialae, Dromaeosauridae, Troodontidae, Oviraptorosauria, and Therizinosauria. &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; and the Alvarezsauroidea are also often included. Together with the next closest sister group, the Ornithomimosauria, Maniraptora comprises the more inclusive clade Maniraptoriformes. Maniraptorans first appear in the fossil record during the Jurassic Period (see &quot;Eshanosaurus&quot;), and survive today as living birds. 

==Description==

Maniraptorans are characterized by long arms and three-fingered hands (though reduced or fused in some lineages), as well as a &quot;half-moon shaped&quot; (semi-lunate) bone in the wrist (carpus). In 2004, Tom Holtz and Halszka Osmólska pointed out six other maniraptoran characters relating to specific details of the skeleton. Unlike most other saurischian dinosaurs, which have pubic bones that point forward, several groups of maniraptorans have an ornithischian-like backwards-pointing hip bone. A backward-pointing hip characterizes the therizinosaurs, dromaeosaurids, avialans, and some primitive troodontids. The fact that the backward-pointing hip is present in so many diverse maniraptoran groups has led most scientists to conclude that the &quot;primitive&quot; forward-pointing hip seen in advanced troodontids and oviraptorosaurs is an evolutionary reversal, and that these groups evolved from ancestors with backward-pointing hips.

===Technical diagnosis===
Holtz and Osmólska (2004) diagnosed the clade Maniraptora based on the following characters: reduced or absent olecranon process of the ulna, greater trochanter and cranial trochanter of the femur fused into a trochanteric crest. An elongated, backwards-pointing pubic bone is present in therizinosauroids, dromaeosaurids, avialans, and the basal troodontid &quot;Sinovenator&quot;, which suggests that the propubic condition in advanced troodontids and oviraptorosaurs is a reversal. Turner &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) named seven synapomorphies that diagnose Maniraptora.

===Feathers and flight===

Modern pennaceous feathers and remiges are known in the advanced maniraptoran group Aviremigia. More primitive maniraptorans, such as therizinosaurs (specifically &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;), preserve a combination of simple downy filaments and unique elongated quills. Simple feathers are known from more primitive coelurosaurs such as &quot;Sinosauropteryx prima&quot;, and possibly from even more distantly related species such as the ornithischian &quot;Tianyulong confuciusi&quot; and the flying pterosaurs. Thus it appears as if some form of feathers or down-like integument would have been present in all maniraptorans, at least when they were young.

Maniraptora is the only dinosaur group known to include flying members, though how far back in this lineage flight extends is controversial. Powered and/or gliding flight is believed to have been present in some types of non-avialan paravians, including dromaeosaurids, such as &quot;Rahonavis&quot; and &quot;Microraptor&quot;. &quot;Zhenyuanlong suni&quot;, a dromaeosaurid, was too heavy to fly but still had wings with feathers required for flying, which suggests its ancestors had the ability for aerial locomotion. Other groups, like the Oviraptorosauria who had a tail with a tail fan of feathers with caudal anatomy resembling a pygostyle, are not known to have been capable of flight, but some scientists, such as Gregory S. Paul, have suggested that they could be descended from ancestors which flew. Paul has gone as far as to propose that Therizinosauria, Alvarezsauroidea, and the non-maniraptoran group Ornithomimosauria also descended from flying ancestors.

==Classification==
The Maniraptora was originally named by Jacques Gauthier in 1986, for a branch-based clade defined as all dinosaurs closer to modern birds than to the ornithomimids. Gauthier noted that this group could be easily characterized by their long forelimbs and hands, which he interpreted as adaptations for grasping (hence the name Maniraptora, which means &quot;hand snatchers&quot; in relation to their &#x27;seizing hands&#x27;). In 1994, Thomas R. Holtz attempted to define the group based on the characteristics of the hand and wrist alone (an &quot;apomorphy-based&quot; definition), and included the long, thin fingers, bowed, wing-like forearm bones, and half-moon shaped wrist bone as key characters. Most subsequent studies have not followed this definition, however, preferring the earlier branch-based definition.

The branch-based definition usually includes the major groups Dromaeosauridae, Troodontidae, Oviraptorosauria, Therizinosauria, and Avialae. Other taxa often found to be maniraptorans include the alvarezsaurs and &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;. Several taxa have been assigned to the Maniraptora more definitively, though their exact placement within the group remains uncertain. These forms include the scansoriopterygids, &quot;Pedopenna&quot;, and &quot;Yixianosaurus&quot;.

In 1993, Perle and colleagues coined the name Metornithes to include alvarezsaurids and modern birds, which the researchers believed were members of the Avialae. This group was defined as a clade by Luis Chiappe in 1995 as the last common ancestor of &quot;Mononykus&quot; and modern birds, and all its descendants.

Pennaraptora (Latin &quot;penna&quot; &quot;bird feather&quot; + &quot;raptor&quot; &quot;thief&quot;, from &quot;rapere&quot; &quot;snatch&quot;; a feathered bird-like predator) is a clade within Maniraptora, defined as the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Oviraptor philoceratops&quot;, &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot;, and &quot;Passer domesticus&quot; (the house sparrow), and all descendants thereof, by Foth &quot;et al.&quot;, 2014. 

The clade &quot;Aviremigia&quot; was conditionally proposed along with several other apomorphy-based clades relating to birds by Jacques Gauthier and Kevin de Queiroz in a 2001 paper. Their proposed definition for the group was &quot;the clade stemming from the first panavian with ... remiges and rectrices, that is, enlarged, stiff-shafted, closed-vaned (= barbules bearing hooked distal pennulae), pennaceous feathers arising from the distal forelimbs and tail&quot;. Ancestral morphology relating to pennaceous feathers suggests that basal species of Pennaraptora were capable of scansorial locomotion and gliding, and further evolution of said adaptation within the clade would eventually give rise to the origin of flight in avian species.

The following cladogram follows the results of a phylogenetic study by Cau (2020).
===Alternative interpretations===
In 2002, Czerkas and Yuan reported that some maniraptoran traits, such as a long, backwards-pointed pubis and short ischia were present in &quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot;, a scansoriopterygid. The authors considered it to be more primitive than true theropods, and hypothesized that maniraptorans may have branched off from theropods at a very early point, or may even have descended from pre-theropod dinosaurs. Zhang &quot;et al.&quot;, in describing the closely related or conspecific specimen &quot;Epidendrosaurus&quot; (now considered a synonym of &quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot;), did not report any of the primitive traits mentioned by Czerkas and Yuan, but did find that the shoulder blade of &quot;Epidendrosaurus&quot; appeared primitive. Despite this, they placed &quot;Epidendrosaurus&quot; firmly within Maniraptora due to a number of synapomorphies.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet===

Scientists traditionally assumed that maniraptorans were ancestrally hypercarnivorous, that is, that most non-avialan species primarily ate and hunted only other vertebrates. However, a number of discoveries made during the first decade of the 21st century, as well as re-evaluation of older evidence, began to suggest that maniraptorans were a primarily omnivorous group, including a number of sub-groups that ate mainly plants, insects, or other food sources besides meat. Additionally, phylogenetic studies of maniraptoran relationships began to more consistently show that herbivorous or omnivorous groups were spread throughout the Maniraptora, rather than representing a single side-branch as previously thought. This led scientists such as Lindsay Zanno to conclude that the ancestral maniraptoran must have been omnivorous, giving rise to several purely herbivorous groups (such as the therizinosaurs, primitive oviraptorosaurs, and some avialans) and that, among non-avians, only one group reverted to pure carnivores (the dromaeosaurids). Most other groups fell somewhere in between the two extremes, with alvarezsaurids and some avialans being insectivorous, and with advanced oviraptorosaurs and troodontids being omnivorous.

=== Reproduction ===
A 2023 study analyzing fossil eggshells assigned to &quot;Troodon&quot; with clumped isotope thermometry found that &quot;Troodon&quot;, and likely other non-avian maniraptorans, had a slowed calcification of eggs akin to that of most reptiles. This contrasts with the rapid calcification of eggs found in modern birds, indicating that most maniraptorans aside from birds retained this basal trait. This would also indicate that most non-avian maniraptorans possessed two functional ovaries, contrasting with the one functional ovary in birds, and were thus limited in the numbers of eggs each individual could produce.

<text>Áed Rúad, son of Badarn, Díthorba, son of Deman, and Cimbáeth, son of Fintan, three grandsons of Airgetmar, were, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, High Kings of Ireland who ruled in rotation, seven years at a time. They each ruled for three seven-year stints. Áed died at the end of his third stint, by drowning in a waterfall which was named &quot;Eas Ruaid&quot;, &quot;the red&#x27;s waterfall&quot; (Assaroe Falls, Ballyshannon, County Donegal), after him; previously the waterfall had been called Ess Duinn, the &quot;Rapid of Donn&quot;, and his death is described as a miracle of sea and mighty wind. Díthorba and Cimbáeth then took their turn, after which Áed&#x27;s daughter, Macha Mong Ruad, demanded to rule in her father&#x27;s place. Díthorba and Cimbáeth refused, and battle ensued. Díthorba was killed. Macha forced Díthorba&#x27;s sons to build her a palace at Emain Macha. She married Cimbáeth and the pair ruled for a further seven years, at the end of which Cimbáeth died of plague, and Macha became the only queen in the List of High Kings of Ireland.

The sources differ as to how the rotation worked. The reigns of Aéd and Díthorba are missing in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; – after the previous High King, Lugaid Laigdech, is killed by Áed, a &quot;dinsenchas&quot; story about the founding of Emain Macha is interpolated, followed by the reign of Cimbáeth, who is said to have succeeded Díthorba and ruled for twenty-eight years. The &quot;dinsenchas&quot; story tells how each of the three cousins ruled for seven years in turn, and each ruled three seven-year stints; the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; agrees, but Geoffrey Keating gives them each a single reign of twenty-one years each, except for Cimbáeth, who rules for twenty. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; synchronises Cimbáeth&#x27;s reign to that of Alexander the Great (336–323 BC). The chronology of Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates their combined reigns to 530–469 BC, the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 731–661 BC.

<text>Joyce Fairbairn (November 6, 1939 – March 29, 2022) was a Canadian senator and was the first woman to serve as the leader of the Government in the Senate.

==Early life and education==
Born in Lethbridge, Alberta on November 6, 1939, Fairbairn was the daughter of Mary Elizabeth (née Young) and Lynden Eldon Fairbairn, a judge of the District Court of Alberta, lawyer, and Liberal candidate for the 1935 and 1940 federal elections in Lethbridge. She was a teenage journalist when she was a student at Lethbridge Collegiate Institute, and wrote a column entitled &quot;Teen Chatter&quot; in the &quot;Lethbridge Herald&quot;. She attended the University of Alberta where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and Carleton University where she earned a degree in journalism. She married Michael Charles Frederick Gillan in 1967; he died in 2002.

== Political life ==
Fairbairn worked as a journalist in the Parliamentary Press Gallery in Ottawa before being hired as a legislative assistant to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1970. In 1981, she became Communications Coordinator in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. On June 29, 1984, just prior to leaving office, Trudeau recommended her for appointment as a Liberal senator for Alberta, her home province. Over the years as a senator, she held a number of positions within the Liberal Party, including Vice-Chair of the National as well as the Western and Northern Liberal Caucus from 1984 to 1991, and Co-Chair of the National Campaign Committee for her party in 1991.

When the Liberals returned to power after the 1993 election, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed Fairbairn to the cabinet as Government Leader in the Senate, the first female senator in the post, and Minister with Special Responsibility for Literacy. She served in cabinet until 1997, after which she took on the role as Special Advisor on Literacy to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. She also chaired the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, and the Special Senate Committee on the Anti-terrorism Act. She sat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry until June 2012.

Fairbairn became involved with the Paralympics movement in Canada as early as 1998. That year, to counter a funding shortfall, she spearheaded fundraising efforts to send a Canadian team to compete in the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, Australia, through &quot;Friends of the Paralympics&quot;, a group that grew and became &quot;a strong political and fundraising voice for the Canadian Paralympic Movement&quot;. By 2000, she co-founded and chaired the Canadian Paralympic Foundation, the first official charitable foundation connected to the Canadian Paralympic Committee, to secure long-term financial support for Paralympic athletes and the committee. In recognition of her role in promoting and supporting Paralympic sports across the country, she was inducted to the Canadian Paralympic Hall of Fame as a builder in 2011.

In August 2012, Fairbairn took indefinite sick leave from the Senate due to the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It was subsequently reported that Fairbairn had been declared legally incompetent in February but had continued voting in the Senate until June. The Fairbairn case led to calls for the Senate to establish rules to address similar situations should they arise. On November 30, 2012, she tendered her resignation to the Governor General with effect from January 18, 2013.

== Later life ==
On March 11, 2018, it was announced that the new middle school in Lethbridge, Alberta would be named after Fairbairn. It was named &quot;Senator Joyce Fairbairn Middle School&quot;, and opened in the fall of 2018.

Joyce Fairbairn died in Lethbridge on March 29, 2022, at the age of 82.

<text>The Mask and Wig Club, a private club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1889, is a historic collegiate musical comedy troupe. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the University of Pennsylvania, Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and audiences across the country.

The club&#x27;s performers, or &quot;The Cast,&quot; put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club&#x27;s own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff.

A number of Mask and Wig original songs were made famous on the radio by mid 20th century recording artists. &quot;The Gypsy in My Soul,&quot; written by Clay Boland and Moe Jaffe for a 1937 show, was recorded by Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, and Ella Fitzgerald. &quot;Daddy&quot;, written by Bobby Troup for a 1941 show, was recorded by Sammy Kaye, Glen Miller and the Andrews Sisters. Troup went on to write the jazz standard &quot;Route 66,&quot; which was recorded by Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby (with the Andrews Sisters), and later the Rolling Stones. The first electrically recorded album ever released was Mask and Wig&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arkansas,&quot; in April 1925.

In a September 30, 2021, press release, the club announced an initiative to remove gender as a qualification for membership, and to expand participation and membership to all genders for the first time in its 134-year history starting with the Fall 2022 recruitment cycle.

==History==
The Mask and Wig Club of the University of Pennsylvania was first conceived of in 1888 by a small group of undergraduates, led by Clayton Fotterall McMichael, who were interested in the stage and desired something the University did not offer: a troupe that would produce original humorous theatrical pieces. In 1889, therefore, McMichael and the other original founders sent out a call for undergraduate men to audition for the group and participate in the creation and production of its first performance.

McMichael and his peers envisioned a group that involved dressing up in frocks and performing spoofs and parodies. Because colleges at the time were open only to young gentlemen, any production was limited to an all–male cast. These organizations naturally saw burlesque, which was quite popular in that era, as the perfect genre. The overblown characterizations, loose plotting, musical interludes, and parody of high art made the style perfect for a group of young, well-educated, amateur men, especially since the drag tradition came &quot;built-in&quot;.

Founder McMichael combed the local bookstores for a story to produce and found it in Henry Byron&#x27;s The Nymphs of the Lurleyburg. A substantially altered version, &quot;Lurline&quot;, the Club&#x27;s first production, hit the boards at the Chestnut Street Opera House on June 4, 1889, for one night only. Backed financially by the ladies of Philadelphia high society, the Club enjoyed great success in its early years. With increasingly reliable audience turnout and revenue from ticket sales, the runs were extended and the Club established a fine tradition among Philadelphia&#x27;s theater-going society. Moreover, the club made a very strong impression on campus and it achieved great notoriety within its first year of existence.
In 1894 the Club purchased a property at 310 South Quince Street to serve as a gathering place and rehearsal hall, the Mask and Wig Clubhouse. The building had been erected by the first African-American Lutheran congregation in America as St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church in 1834, but had been sold in 1839 and converted into a coachhouse and stable, and later into a dissecting room for medical students. Prominent Philadelphia architect Wilson Eyre was commissioned to remodel the building and hired the young Maxfield Parrish, who would later become one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, to decorate the interior. The Grille Room was decorated with caricatures of members, a tradition that continues today, with the second century of members&#x27; caricatures continued upstairs at the entrance to the auditorium. Eyre expanded the clubhouse to its present size, 1901-1903.

The Club prospered throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The middle of this century was a heady time for the Club. Mask and Wig songs were the rage of the big band orchestras, radio shows, and solo acts of the day. The likes of Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Rosemary Clooney, and Les Brown all covered Mask and Wig tunes. Between 1952 and 1958, the club appeared four times on The Ed Sullivan Show. The 1961 production, &quot;Wry on the Rocks&quot;, introduced a satirical revue format in a cabaret atmosphere. In 1992, with &quot;Myth America&quot;, Mask and Wig returned the student–written book musical to its stage, a practice which continues to this day. Important in the show&#x27;s success are the traditional high standards in the caliber of performers and excellence of the material performed. The Club&#x27;s primary purpose has always been and continues to be, &quot;Justice to the stage; credit to the University.&quot;

Immediately after the end of World War II the Mask and Wig dormitory on the residence quadrangle was used to house a U.S. Army unit assigned to quickly learn the Japanese language. Upon the completion of the study, the soldiers were to be commissioned in the U.S. Army and serve in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) of the Army in Japan. This army unit had classes in the University in the Egyptian Antiquities room while being scrutinized by several mummies. Classes were also held in the Wharton School of Business. Jerry Epple, a member of the Army Specialized Training Program, says he remembers to this day the stone carving of a mask and wig near the dormitory entrance.

Mask and Wig&#x27;s yearly tour over spring break brings the show to alumni clubs across the nation.

==Organization==
===Club organization===

The Mask and Wig Club is unique in that it consists of both alumni and undergraduate members who have participated in the Annual Production. The Troupe consists of undergraduates who audition each fall and are selected into the various company sections (see below).

The Club produces the Annual Production and maintains and operates its own landmark theater at 310 South Quince Street (see below). The Clubhouse is a popular wedding and event venue in Philadelphia and was named &quot;Best Party Venue&quot; by Philadelphia Magazine in 2010.

===Undergraduate sections===
The Mask and Wig Club is made up of four distinct sections: the cast, the band, the crew, and the business staff.

The cast writes and performs material for productions. The band functions as a pit orchestra, playing original, self-arranged pieces for the Undergraduate Fall Show, and professionally arranged pieces for the Annual Production. The band also holds the headliner spot at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s annual Spring Fling festival in the Quad. The crew builds elaborate, ornate, and completely original sets for Productions. The business staff is responsible for advertising and selling tickets for the Club&#x27;s shows.

==Performances==

===Free Show===
Free Show is the first Mask and Wig show of the academic year. The show is held during the first week of the academic year and is free of charge to all new freshmen. The cast performs classic bits that are tried and true. Free Show serves a few purposes: it introduces the new freshmen of the University of Pennsylvania to one of Penn&#x27;s oldest institutions and hopes to recruit new members by displaying what membership in the group entails. In 2018, for the first time, the Free Show was performed in collaboration with Penn&#x27;s all-female musical sketch comedy troupe, Bloomers.

===Undergraduate Fall Show===
Each fall, the undergraduates produce their own sketch comedy show that runs for one week in a theater on Penn&#x27;s campus. The upperclassmen handle all aspects of production from acting direction to choreography to musical production. A notable highlight of the show is the Second Act Opener, which consists of a medley of songs from a famous musician or group, but with parodied lyrics that often follow a Penn-centered plot. Past parodied musicians include Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, The Beatles, Aerosmith, Disney, and Queen.

===ComFest===
In 1999, Mask and Wig established an annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival to showcase the talent of the nation&#x27;s best collegiate sketch comedy troupes. The mission of the festival is not just to put on a hilarious show that cultivates new talent, but also to honor and showcase a well-known comedian. Each host does a stand-up routine for the audience and participates in sketches with Mask and Wig. Past college sketch troupes include:
*Princeton Triangle Club
*University of Maryland Sketchup
*Yale Fifth Humour
*Boston College Hello Shovelhead
*Cornell University Humor Us! Sketch Comedy
*Tufts University&#x27;s Major: Undecided Sketch Comedy

===Annual Production &quot;Spring Show&quot;===
The Annual Production, colloquially known as the &quot;Spring Show&quot;, is the theatrical centerpiece of Mask and Wig. Performed at The Mask and Wig Clubhouse, the production is an original show that runs from late January to early April. While the format of the Spring Show has evolved over the years, the show currently runs as a full &quot;book&quot; musical comedy, complete with singing and tap dancing.

Unlike the Fall Show, the Annual Production is professionally composed, directed, and choreographed by some of the best talents in the industry. The script, however, is written by the Club&#x27;s cast.

===Tour===
During spring break the troupe takes their show around the country as they road trip across the United States, usually performing in areas with a high Penn alumni concentration. The trip usually includes about four to six stops. In recent years the tour has taken Wig to cities like London, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Toronto.

The tour is yet another one of the group&#x27;s many traditions. In Mask and Wig&#x27;s “heyday,” the group had its own train car that it would use to do a similar tour around the nation.

===Spring Fling===

The Mask and Wig Band traditionally headlines the last day of Spring Fling performances, which was historically a Saturday, at the stage in the Lower Quad. In 2018, the festival was moved to Penn Park along with the Mask and Wig performance. They generally perform an hour-long set of covers of popular music. Members of the cast generally sing with the band, along with female vocalists from other Penn performing arts groups.

==The Clubhouse==
===Clubhouse art===
Working in his studio just a few blocks away at Thirteenth and Walnut Streets, Maxfield Parrish received one of his first commissions in 1894 from Mask and Wig. This first job came as he was finishing his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy; it was for decoration of the stage proscenium and ticket window, illustration of a number of caricatures on the wall of the Grille Room, and most notably the Old King Cole mural. This was the start of his professional career; shortly after seeing the mural, the editor of “Harper&#x27;s” Magazine invited Parrish to do some of their covers for which he became famous. He would continue working for the Club to finish a total of 35 caricatures and illustrate the earliest program covers.
Wilson Eyre was older and more established than Parrish when he began working on the Clubhouse, and was good friends with Parrish&#x27;s father, Stephen. Eyre was the architect in charge of renovating the Club&#x27;s new home and transforming it from a stable into a “Bavarian” themed Clubhouse. His first remodel in 1894 transformed the space from the stable by adding an entry hall with stairs, designing and decorating the Grille Room, and turning the second floor into a theater. Eyre designed most of the furniture in the Grille Room; three of the original tables still exist. Eyre also oversaw the second major change. The building was enlarged in 1903 by adding 10 feet to the front creating the façade that still exists there today. Eyre&#x27;s original drawing of the front design, created in 1902, is shown to the right. Eyre&#x27;s design has endured for over a century with few changes aside from the ongoing addition of paneling for caricatures in the Grille Room and Theater.

===Clubhouse renovations===
Immediately following the close of the 2007 Spring show, the clubhouse underwent an extensive renovation. In addition to bringing the building up to modern code, the club also installed an elevator and central air conditioning unit. On the morning of March 15, 2008, a fire broke out in the attic of the clubhouse, setting back the completion date indefinitely. The club had a contingency plan in case of such an emergency and was able to put on their show. &quot;West Wing Story&quot; played for two weekends in April 2008 at the Prince Music Theater in downtown Philadelphia, marking the first annual production to be performed at a venue other than the clubhouse since 1960. With renovations still behind schedule in 2009, the annual production &quot;Oh, the Humanities!&quot; was also performed at the Prince Music Theater for three weekends, selling a record number of tickets due to the large theater capacity. The clubhouse renovation was completed in the fall of 2009, allowing the club to once again return to its own stage for the 2010 Annual Production, &quot;A Cheshire Catastrophe&quot;.

<text>Bricriu (also Briccriu, Bricne) is a hospitaller (&quot;briugu&quot;), troublemaker and poet in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

==&quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot;==
The story of &quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot; (&quot;The Feast of Bricriu&quot;) tells how he once held a lavish feast for Conchobar mac Nessa and the heroes of Ulster in his house at Dún Rudraige (modern Dundrum, County Down), but knowing his reputation the Ulstermen had to be threatened to attend. First Bricriu threatened to set the Ulster warriors at odds with each other, then to set father against son and mother against daughter, but the Ulstermen finally agreed to come when he threatened to set the two breasts of each Ulster woman beating against each other.

At the feast he promised the &quot;champion&#x27;s portion&quot; to Cú Chulainn, then to Conall Cernach, then to Lóegaire Búadach, and the three heroes proceeded to compete for the honour. Challenges were set, some judged by Ailill and Medb of Connacht, some by Cú Roí of Munster. At every test set Cú Chulainn came out top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire would accept the decision.

Finally Cú Roí, disguised as a giant churl, challenged each of the three to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Only Cú Chulainn passed this test, and was judged worthy of the champion&#x27;s portion. (Two motifs in this story, the champion&#x27;s portion and the beheading challenge, are mentioned by the Greek writer Posidonius as practices of the ancient Celts. The beheading challenge is also central to the Middle English Arthurian poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.)

==Other==
Bricriu followed Fergus mac Róich into exile in Connacht following the Deirdre affair. While he was a guest at Cruachan he caused a lot of trouble for Fergus and another lover of his, Flidais, which culminated at the &quot;Táin Bó Flidhais&quot;. In the &quot;Echtra Nerai&quot;, Bricriu mocks the singing of Fergus, comparing it to a bull-calf&#x27;s bellowing. Fergus strikes him with 5 &quot;fidchell&quot; pieces, injuring him severely. Later, Bricriu recovered but died at Cruachan at the end of the &quot;Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley), trampled to death by the two bulls as they fought.

&quot;Fled Bricrenn&quot; is preserved in the near-contemporary Leabhar na h-Uidhri (The Book of the Dun Cow) and in four later manuscripts.

The name of the village of Loughbrickland, near Banbridge, County Down, is thought to derive from Irish &quot;Loch Briccrend&quot; or Bricriu&#x27;s Lake, where he was a chieftain and lived in the &#x27;Watery Fort&#x27; (ringfort) overlooking the loch.

<doc id="1088471" wikidata="Q1088092" url="?curid=1088471" title="The New Danger">
<text>The New Danger is the second studio album by American rapper Mos Def, released on October 12, 2004, by Rawkus and Geffen Records. It is the follow-up to his breakthrough solo effort &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; (1999), after which he devoted more time into his film and stage career.

==Production==
Production for the album was handled by Mos Def, Kanye West, 88-Keys, Minnesota, Warryn Campbell, and Psycho Les. It also features contributions from Mos Def&#x27;s rock musical project Black Jack Johnson, which was named after boxing champion Jack Johnson and consists of guitarist Dr. Know, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Doug Wimbish, and drummer Will Calhoun.

==Critical reception ==
&quot;The New Danger&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics; it holds an aggregate score of 59 out of 100 at Metacritic. &quot;Blender&quot; called it &quot;mushily sentimental, self-righteously indignant and constantly in your face&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Andy Kellman said it was &quot;a sprawling, overambitious mess&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; magazine panned the album as &quot;an unsatisfying muddle of protest music, black rock, and rap&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kelefa Sanneh wrote that the record suffered from extended soul songs that meandered, dull rock songs, and some raps such as &quot;The Rape Over&quot; that were devoid of Mos Def&#x27;s usual &quot;warmth and wit&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; deemed some of the songs failed experiments but also highlighted &quot;Boogie Man Song&quot;, &quot;Modern Marvel&quot;, and &quot;Champion Requiem&quot; as more timeless material. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Tom Moon was more enthusiastic, hailing the album as an &quot;earthy, impressively diverse&quot; work that showcased Mos Def&#x27;s abilities to &quot;create deeply nuanced characterizations&quot; and &quot;broaden the hip-hop palette without sacrificing, or selling out, its core ideals&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said while Mos Def&#x27;s previous records were driven by his &quot;verbal flow&quot;, &quot;The New Danger&quot; was more interesting musically and defined by its sonic flow, which the critic described as &quot;a shadowy, guitar-drenched tone poem of the streets&quot;. In his ballot for the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, he named it the 19th best album of 2004. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; included the track &quot;Zimzallabim&quot; in their list of &quot;Ten Rap-Rock Songs That Are Actually Awesome&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The New Danger&quot; was released by Geffen Records on October 12, 2004, in the United States and October 18 in the United Kingdom. It debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its first week, and by March 2014, it had sold 513,000 copies in the US. In August 2017, the album was certified gold by the RIAA, indicating sales and their equivalents—streams and track downloads—of 500,000 units in the U.S.

<doc id="1088484" wikidata="Q3101559" url="?curid=1088484" title="George Fenneman">
<text>George Watt Fenneman (November 10, 1919 – May 29, 1997) was an American radio and television announcer. Fenneman is best remembered as the show announcer and straight man on Groucho Marx&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. Marx, said of Fenneman in 1976, &quot;There never was a comedian who was any good unless he had a good straight man, and George was straight on all four sides&quot;. Fenneman, born in Peking (Beijing), China, died from respiratory failure in Los Angeles, California, on May 29, 1997, at the age of 77.

==Early life==
Fenneman was born in Peking (now Beijing), China, the only child of Edgar Warfield and Jessico &quot;Jessie&quot; (née Watt) Fenneman. He was an infant when his parents moved to San Francisco, California, where he grew up. Fenneman&#x27;s father was a certified public accountant and worked in the import-export business. His mother was an author and a minister of the Divine Art of Living. When Fenneman was eight, he wrote and starred in his own drama before his neighborhood friends in the basement of his home. Fenneman grew up in San Francisco&#x27;s West Portal district.

==Education==
Fenneman graduated from San Francisco Polytechnic High School. In 1942 he graduated from San Francisco State College with a B.A. in Speech and Drama.

==Military service==
Poor eyesight and asthma prevented Fenneman from military action in World War II. Fenneman became a broadcast correspondent for the U.S. Office of War Information, where he met Jack Webb, a fellow staff announcer who would later hire him for Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; radio and TV series. Fenneman&#x27;s work in the Army included announcing the wartime service show &quot;Sound Off!&quot;.

In the early part of World War II, he and college classmate Bob Sweeney formed a stand-up comedy team and entertained troops at military bases.

==Broadcast career==
===Radio===
In 1941, Fenneman was hired by KSFO (AM) radio for $35 per week. He immediately found himself hosting the show &quot;Lunch at the Top of the Mark&quot;. The 22-year-old Fenneman&#x27;s first interview that day was the actor Boris Karloff. In 1942, Fenneman took a job as a radio announcer and actor at KGO (AM), increasing his salary to $55 per week. His first acting role on the station was the early California bandit Joaquin Murrieta in the production &quot;Golden Days&quot;.

Returning to broadcasting in 1946 following World War II, he moved to Los Angeles. &quot;I figured if you&#x27;re going to be in this business, you&#x27;ve got to be in southern California&quot;. In 1948, the &quot;George Fenneman Show&quot; was heard weekdays at 4:00 p.m. on KECA (AM) radio in Los Angeles. Fenneman was reported to be &quot;one of the better radio voices&quot;. In 1948, Fenneman was an announcer for the Abbott and Costello radio show. He became the announcer on the &quot;Coca-Cola Victory Parade of Spotlight Bands&quot;, heard on over 168 radio stations on the NBC Blue Network.

===&quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;===
Fenneman is best remembered as the announcer and good-natured sidekick for Groucho Marx&#x27;s comedy/quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. He won the audition as the radio show&#x27;s announcer in 1947. Fenneman stayed with the show when it moved to television in 1950, on NBC where it remained for 11 years. Fenneman was known as &quot;Groucho Marx&#x27;s man Friday, who helps him on Wednesdays (on radio) and Thursdays (on TV)&quot;.

Fenneman&#x27;s mellifluous voice, clean-cut good looks, and gentlemanly manner provided the ideal foil for Marx&#x27;s zany antics and bawdy ad libs. 

Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Dwan, director of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; said &#x27;He had a naturally good voice&quot;. One day, Fenneman met Dwan at Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles during his lunch hour. Dwan told Fenneman to immediately go to a studio where auditions were being held for a new Groucho Marx program. Dwan said Fenneman&#x27;s demeanor made him the perfect straight man for the show. Initially hired for $55 per week, Fenneman&#x27;s salary reportedly grew to &quot;more than $50,000 per year&quot;.

Dwan said &quot;He was the perfect foil for Groucho. We didn&#x27;t pick him for that reason, however. We picked him because he was very bright, someone who could keep track of the quiz score and do the math on the spot. George&#x27;s main principle was that he didn&#x27;t tell the jokes, no matter how good a reply he might have. He knew what his role was, and he was, above all, a gentleman&quot;. Fenneman got the job, and was paid $55 a week to start. Groucho frequently encouraged contestants to bet odd amounts, making the arithmetic difficult to keep straight on the fly during a live show. Dwan said &quot;Groucho had a tendency to get them (the show&#x27;s contestants) to bet odd amounts, like $17.36. So George had a bit of a task&quot;. Fenneman said he was &quot; a spring-board of interplay&quot; between him and Marx. &quot;I was the foil for a lot of his wit. It was sheer trauma for me. I showed up every night and prayed&quot;.

Fenneman was a resilient target of Marx&#x27;s frequent mispronunciations of his name (&quot;Feminine&quot;) and other light-hearted teasing. &quot;Groucho called Fenneman the male Margaret Dumont&quot;, according to Frank Ferrante, who portrayed Marx onstage in &quot;Groucho: A Life in Revue.&quot; &quot;George took it as the highest praise. Groucho called him the perfect straight man&quot;.

Fenneman said &quot;I was the gentleman, the nice fellow. Older ladies who would watch the show would see me as their son. Oh, the letters they used to write, castigating mean old Groucho for being cruel to that nice young man&quot;.

When a young female contestant referred to Fenneman as &quot;Mr. Fidderman&quot;, Marx ordered Fenneman onstage and accused him of leading a &quot;double life&quot;. On one episode Fenneman was suspended in a harness as a substitute for the show&#x27;s stuffed duck that was dropped from overhead with a $100 payoff in its beak when a contestant said the secret word during every episode. Fenneman&#x27;s wife said &quot;Everyone had told Groucho 47 times before the show, &#x27;Don&#x27;t touch him&#x27;, so George came down, and Groucho immediately came over and pushed him; and he turned upside down. He was absolutely terrified&quot;.

Fenneman said of working with Marx, &quot;I can&#x27;t impress on you too much what it meant to be working with a legend. I was 30 years old and working with this man who was 60 at the time, who&#x27;d been the biggest star of all the media&quot;.

==Success in reruns==

It was customary practice, established in radio, for a successful network series to take the summer months off and return in the fall. A summer-replacement series, usually a musical or comedy half-hour, would fill the established time slot for 13 weeks until the parent program returned. &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; was the first network TV series to &quot;continue&quot; into the summer months, with reruns of some of the previous season&#x27;s better episodes. To inform the public that these summer broadcasts were repeats and not new programs, the summer show was titled &quot;The Best of Groucho&quot;. 

After &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; ended its network run in 1961, NBC&#x27;s syndication department prepared new versions of the 1950s shows, with all mentions of the original sponsor removed or cropped out of the picture. Because the reruns had already been established as &quot;The Best of Groucho&quot;, the syndicated version took that title, and was very successful. 

Gradually the show fell out of fashion, as faster-paced game shows videotaped in color forced the old, leisurely black-and-white show off the air. The show remained a memory until 1975, when Groucho Marx accepted a huge shipment of old film prints from an NBC warehouse. Producer John Guedel, anxious to see if there was still a market for the show, sold it on a trial basis to a local station for less than $50 for each night. The show became an instant success, prompting Guedel to send the reruns into syndication almost immediately.

George Fenneman remained friends with Marx until the latter&#x27;s death in 1977. During that year, Fenneman recalled he was walking a frail Groucho Marx back to his bed during one of his last visits and Marx quietly whispered &quot;Fenneman, you always were a lousy dancer&quot;.

===&quot;The Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Show&quot;===
Fenneman also announced the &quot;Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Comedy Show&quot;, sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes. Fenneman said Martin and Lewis would shower him with sheet music or cut off his tie while he was on camera selling cigarettes. On one episode, Fenneman spoofed himself. During a parody of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, on the broadcast of October 14, 1952, &quot;Groucho Martin&quot; (Dean Martin) asks Fenneman to remind listeners about how &quot;the other couple&quot; is doing. Fenneman said &quot;The sponsor and the sponsor&#x27;s wife are way ahead with eighteen million dollars&quot;.

===Game show host===
Fenneman also hosted many game shows: in 1953, &quot;Your Claim To Fame&quot;, a panel quiz show sponsored by the Regal Amber Brewing Company of San Francisco, &quot;Anybody Can Play&quot; in 1958 with Dolores Reed, &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot;, &quot;Who In The World&quot; and &quot;Your Surprise Package&quot; in 1961. Fenneman hosted an un-aired pilot episode of &quot;Take My Advice&quot;, an NBC game show where a celebrity panel offered advice to contestants about how to handle personal problems. In 1966 he hosted two pilot episodes for &quot;Crossword&quot;, a game show that would be renamed &quot;The Cross-Wits&quot; in 1975 and aired with Jack Clark as host.

===Commercial production company===
Fenneman formed the &quot;George Fenneman Productions (Ltd.)&quot; commercial production company in 1962. His first client was the Douglas Fir Plywood Association. He also created commercials for the Paper Mate pen company.

He was the commercial spokesman for Lipton Tea during much of the 1960s, and in that role appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; when The Beatles made their second U.S. TV appearance on February 16, 1964. The entire episode (including commercials) had been taped at Miami Beach, Florida&#x27;s Hotel Deauville prior to broadcast.

Fenneman also recorded commercials for Philip Morris. From 1978 to the end of his life in 1995, Fenneman was both the public relations spokesperson and commercial announcer for the Los Angeles, California Home Savings &amp; Loan.

===Television show host===
In 1963, he hosted an ABC television program called &quot;Your Funny, Funny Films&quot;, a precursor to &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. He was also host of a highly regarded KCET-TV program, &quot;On Campus&quot;.

On January 14, 1964, Fenneman hosted the half-hour special, &quot;Here Comes a Star&quot;. During the special, Fenneman led the audience on a tour of the then brand new Hanna-Barbera Animation Studio on Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood, California. Fenneman interviewed Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera as they readied their newest cartoon show &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;. The show featured story artists, layout men, animators, inkers and painters putting together the first Magilla Gorilla cartoon. The show ended with the completed premiere episode of the cartoon.

In 1974, Fenneman co-hosted &quot;Talk About Pictures&quot;, an Emmy Award-winning program created by &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer Leigh Wiener. The show featured a wide-ranging cross-section of photographers and photography collectors including Ansel Adams, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Graham Nash. 130 episodes were broadcast on NBC&#x27;s Los Angeles affiliate KNBC. The show won a local Emmy award in 1974.

==Announcing career==
Fenneman was the announcer for a number of radio shows, including &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot;, &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot;, &quot;The Eddie Albert Show&quot; and &quot;The Hedda Hopper Show&quot;. He was also an announcer on television shows as well, including &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot; and &quot;The Donny &amp; Marie Show&quot;. He was also an announcer on the radio program &quot;Go Navy! The Navy Swings&quot;. Fenneman described the show as &quot;a labor of love&quot;.

Fenneman also narrated many commercial and industrial films including work for Lockheed Aviation and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

===&quot;Dragnet&quot;===
Fenneman was one of a pair of announcers on &quot;Dragnet&quot;. He shared narration duties with Hal Gibney on radio and the original 1951 &quot;Dragnet&quot; television series, and then with John Stephenson when Dragnet returned to TV in 1967. It was Fenneman&#x27;s voice which announced, &quot;The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent&quot;, while Stephenson would be heard at the end of the episode describing the court trials and verdicts.

On radio, Fenneman also provided the intro to the finale (and last commercial): &quot;On (date), trial was held in Department (number), Superior Court of the State of California. In a moment, the results of that trial. Now, here is our star, Jack Webb, for (sponsor)&quot;.

(Webb frequently took the cue with &quot;Thank you, George&quot; or &quot;Thank you, George Fenneman,&quot; as Fenneman was not identified in the show&#x27;s credits, which were read by Gibney and ended with &quot;Hal Gibney speaking&quot;.)

===&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;===
He was the principal commercial announcer for the radio version of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and frequently introduced &quot;Matt Dillon&quot; (William Conrad) after the episode to extoll the virtues of L&amp;M or Chesterfield cigarettes.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
Fenneman narrated &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Marge on the Lam&quot; broadcast on November 4, 1993. The episode&#x27;s closing sequence is a reference to &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Fenneman recorded the episode&#x27;s ending in a &quot;Dragnet&quot;-style summation of the three principal characters&#x27; fate.

===Residual income from announcing===
Fenneman purchased a 10 percent interest in the &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; production company. &quot;I had a good lawyer&quot; Fenneman said. &quot;Instead of the usual residuals, I get a percentage of the gross revenues (from &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;)&quot;. Fenneman also received residual payments for &quot;Dragnet&quot;. &quot;Every time you see the show and hear me say &#x27;The story you are about to see is true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent&#x27;, I get a paycheck. A small one, but they add up&quot;.

===Spurious credits===
Oft-repeated statements that Fenneman is the voice of the US Naval Observatory Master Clock or the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s radio station WWV are untrue. Those announcements were actually performed by Fred Covington (1928–1993).

==Acting career==
===Radio actor===
Fenneman played Buzz, the co-pilot on the radio show &quot;I Fly Anything&quot;, a radio adventure drama, broadcast on ABC from November 29, 1950, until July 19, 1951.

===Film and television actor===
He appeared on screen in the 1951 film &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; as &quot;Dr. Redding&quot;, Fenneman was a neighbor of &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;″s director, Christian Nyby. A spontaneous on-set script revision convinced Fenneman his future was not in movie acting. Producer Howard Hawks took a long scientific speech away from Robert O. Cornthwaite&#x27;s character Dr. Carrington, preferring to give exposition to a minor character (Fenneman). The scene was &quot;the most difficult to shoot&quot; in the science fiction film. Fellow cast member Kenneth Tobey said &quot;George didn&#x27;t even know what he was talking about, and it took him thirty takes to get through the speech&quot;. As a radio performer accustomed to reading from a script and not used to quick memorization, Fenneman stumbled over the technical gobbledegook (&quot;We have the time of arrival on the seismograph...&quot;), resulting in multiple takes of the scene. In the final film, viewers can see the other actors trying not to smile as Fenneman spouts the lines.

In the 1950s, he made appearances in serialized science and nature themed segments on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, including a February 1957 appearance as Dr. Bill Richards, who undertakes a difficult expedition into the wilderness in &quot;The Secret Of Mystery Lake&quot;.

Fenneman portrayed Randy Rambo in &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot; episode &quot;The Prying Eye,&quot; broadcast on March 28, 1961. On October 20, 1966, he appeared as a newsman in &quot;The Yegg Foes of Gotham&quot;, episode 48 of the &quot;Batman&quot; TV show.

In 1967 Fenneman appeared in the film adaptation of the Broadway show &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; as himself. In the film, he portrayed the host of a new television show who is introduced as &quot;George Fenneman&quot;. He is credited at the end as &quot;TV Announcer&quot;.

==Personal life==

Fenneman married his college sweetheart, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Jane Clifford in 1943. They had three children. He died from respiratory failure at his home in Los Angeles, California, on May 29, 1997, at the age of 77. Fenneman&#x27;s body was cremated, and the location of ashes is unknown.

<text>Netherland (2008) is a novel by Joseph O&#x27;Neill. It concerns the life of a Dutchman living in New York in the wake of the September 11 attacks who takes up cricket and starts playing at the Staten Island Cricket Club.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Netherland&quot; opens on protagonist Hans van den Broek, a Dutch financial analyst living in London with his English wife Rachel, but quickly flashes back to the years Hans spent in New York City before and in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. At the beginning of the novel, Hans is preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and making big, optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by Chuck’s magnetic ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with his Trinidadian friend who is discovered, years later, simply a body, handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.

==Publication and reviews==
The writing of &quot;Netherland&quot; occupied O&#x27;Neill for seven years. When it was finished, O&#x27;Neill had great trouble in finding an agent. The book was turned down by every major US publisher, until it was accepted by Pantheon Books, a division of Random House. Chief executive Sonny Mehta was a cricket fan, and after reading &quot;Netherland&quot;, wrote a strong personal recommendation to booksellers.

&quot;Netherland&quot; was published in May 2008 and was featured on the cover of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; where senior editor Dwight Garner called it &quot;the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we&#x27;ve yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Center fell&quot;. Later that year, the book was included in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; list of &quot;10 Best Books of 2008&quot; as chosen by the paper&#x27;s editors. 

Upon release, &quot;Netherland&quot; was generally well-received. According to &quot;Book Marks&quot;, the book received &quot;rave&quot; reviews based on 9 critic reviews with 6 being &quot;rave&quot; and 2 being &quot;positive&quot; and 1 being &quot;mixed&quot;. On &quot;Bookmarks Magazine&quot; Jul/Aug 2008 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (4.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with the critical summary stating, &quot;Few novels that reference a classic actually live up to that classic, but critics agreed that &quot;Netherland&quot;, modeled after F. Scott Fitzgerald’s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, lives up to Fitzgerald’s archetypal portrayal of the American dream&quot;. James Wood, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, called it &quot;one of the most remarkable postcolonial books I have ever read&quot;. He wrote that it has been &quot;consistently misread as a 9/11 novel, which stints what is most remarkable about it: that it is a postcolonial re-writing of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.&quot; In an interview with the author published at the end of the Harper Perennial paperback edition, Joseph O&#x27;Neill remarks, &quot;Clearly &quot;Netherland&quot; is having some sort of conversation with &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;—saying goodbye to it perhaps, and to some of the notions associated with that wonderful book.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
In the weeks leading up the announcement of the 2008 Man Booker Prize, &quot;Netherland&quot; was spoken of by some literary pundits as being the favourite to win. However, on 9 September 2008, the Booker nominee shortlist was announced and the novel, surprisingly at least for some critics at the &quot;New York Times&quot;, failed to make the list. The book was also nominated for the Warwick Prize for Writing (2008/9) and made it to the long list of that prize announced in November 2008.

&quot;Netherland&quot; won the 2009 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, and the 2009 Kerry Group Irish Fiction Award.

On 12 April 2010, Netherland was announced as one of the eight novels on the shortlist for the International Dublin Literary Award.

==Translations==
The punning title is untranslatable into Dutch, and the Dutch translation takes the title &quot;Laagland&quot; (&quot;Lowland&quot;) rather than the more literal but ambiguous &quot;Nederland&quot;.

<doc id="1088491" wikidata="Q457145" url="?curid=1088491" title="Sigismondo d'India">
<text>Sigismondo d&#x27;India (c. 1582 – before 19 April 1629) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was one of the most accomplished contemporaries of Monteverdi, and wrote music in many of the same forms as the more famous composer.

==Life==
d&#x27;India was probably born in Palermo, Sicily in 1582, though details of his life are lacking until around 1600. During the first decade of the 17th century he probably traveled widely in Italy, meeting composers, acquiring patrons at various aristocratic courts, and absorbing the musical styles at each locale. This was a time of transition in music history, as the polyphonic style of the late Renaissance was giving way to the widely diverse practices of the early Baroque, and d&#x27;India seems to have acquired an unusually broad grasp of the total stylistic practice in Italy: the expressive madrigal style of Marenzio, the grand polychoral work of the Venetian School, the conservative polyphonic tradition of the Roman School, the attempts to recover the music of the ancient world in monody and its larger vehicle, the newly developing opera, as well as the mannered, emotionally intense chromatic style of Carlo Gesualdo in Naples. d&#x27;India is known to have been in Florence, the birthplace of opera, as well as Mantua, where Monteverdi was working. In Naples he probably met Gesualdo, and by 1610 he was in Parma and Piacenza. The next year, 1611, he was hired by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, to direct music in Turin, where he remained until 1623; these were the most productive years of his life, during which he amalgamated the disparate types of music he had heard and absorbed during the years 1600–1610 into a unified style.

After leaving Turin – apparently forced out by malicious gossip – he traveled around Italy for five months before settling for a time at the D&#x27;Este court in Modena (October 1623 to April 1624), and then moved to Rome; he seems to have died in Modena, although details on the end of his life are as sparse as they were for its beginning. A record exists of his being granted an appointment in Bavaria at the court of Maximilian I, although there is no evidence he went there; he may have died first.

==Works==
d&#x27;India&#x27;s output consisted of music in most of the vocal forms of the time, including monodies, madrigals, and motets. His monodies, the most numerous and significant portion of his work, were of many types: arias, both through-composed and strophic, variations over ground basses, laments, madrigals in the monodic style, and others.

Stylistically, d&#x27;India&#x27;s music has features in common with Monteverdi&#x27;s music of the same period: expressive chromaticism, dissonances with unusual resolutions, and a keen sense of drama. Indeed, some of the longer monodies are effectively operatic scenes, though d&#x27;India did not write anything specifically called an &quot;opera.&quot;

His polyphonic madrigals often borrow textural ideas from Gesualdo, especially in juxtaposing slow, intensely chromatic music with light, almost delirious diatonic passages; in this regard d&#x27;India was one of Gesualdo&#x27;s few successors (until the 20th century). Some of d&#x27;India&#x27;s later music is unusual in showing aspects of the influence of almost &quot;all&quot; of the contemporary composers in Italy within a single piece.

<text>The Green Monster was the name of several vehicles built by Art Arfons and his half-brother Walt Arfons. These ranged from dragsters to a turbojet-powered car that briefly held the land speed record three times during 1964 and 1965.

The land speed record &quot;Green Monster&quot; set the absolute record three times during the close competition of 1964 and 1965. It was powered by a General Electric J79 taken from an F-104 Starfighter. The jet engine had a four-stage afterburner.

==Early dragsters==
The first &quot;Green Monster&quot; appeared in 1952. It was a three-wheeled dragster powered by an Oldsmobile six-cylinder engine and painted with left-over green tractor paint. The name was applied on the car&#x27;s first outing by the track announcer, Ed Piasczik (Paskey), who laughingly said, &quot;Okay folks, here it comes: The Green Monster&quot;, and it stuck to all Arfons&#x27; creations. The car only reached , short of the fastest car, but by 1953, &quot;Green Monster 2&quot;, a long six wheeled car powered by an Allison V12 aircraft engine, was hitting in the quarter mile.

&quot;Green Monster 2&quot; was painted by Arfons&#x27; mother to resemble the World War II Curtiss P-40 Flying Tigers fighter airplane, with an open mouth showing large teeth. The top speed of the car was estimated at , and it could reach in nine to ten seconds from a standing start. Running on passenger car tires required four wheels on the rear drive axle to withstand the power. At the first World Series of Drag Racing at Lawrenceville, Illinois, it clocked the highest top speed at , and eventually a world record of .

The later cars had various paint schemes where green was not necessarily the dominant color. The six-wheeled &quot;Green Monster 6&quot; became the first dragster to break in the quarter mile. &quot;Green Monster 11&quot;, Art Arfons&#x27; favorite, hit to beat Don Garlits.

Arfons used an Allison V1710 in several &quot;Green Monster&quot;s.

== Land speed racing ==

The Arfons brothers split up, and each became interested in land speed racing.

The most famous &quot;Green Monster&quot; was powered by a surplus F-104 Starfighter General Electric J79 jet engine, producing static thrust with four-stage afterburner, which Arfons purchased from a scrap dealer for $600 and rebuilt himself, over the objections of General Electric and the government, and despite all manuals for the engine being classified top secret.

The engine had been scrapped because of damage caused by ingesting a bolt. Arfons removed 60 blades out of approximately 1000 in the engine, removing broken blades and their counterparts at 180 degrees or the pair at +/-120 degrees to maintain balance. He tested it by tying it to trees in his garden, which drew complaints from his neighbors.

This car, painted in red and blue, set the land speed record three times during the close competition of 1964 and 1965 with averages of in the flying mile (despite blowing a tire on the last record run). It competed against &quot;Wingfoot Express&quot; (built by his brother Walt, who could not pilot the car himself, having suffered a stroke) and Craig Breedlove&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of America – Sonic 1&quot;, which eventually set the record at .

In 1966, Arfons returned once again to the Bonneville Salt Flats but reached an average speed of only . On run number seven at 8:03 a.m. on November 17, Arfons crashed his vehicle travelling when a wheel bearing seized. He subsequently built another &quot;Green Monster&quot; land speed record car but sold it to California rancher Slick Gardner without driving it.

==Later vehicles==
In view of his wife&#x27;s concern over the risk involved in land speed record racing, Arfons instead turned his talents to turbine-powered tractor pulling with great success, fielding a series of &quot;Green Monster&quot; tractor pullers with his son and daughter.

However, in 1989, Arfons returned to Bonneville with &quot;Green Monster 27&quot;, an , long two-wheeler. The car left the ground at , and Arfons rebuilt it into a less radical four-wheeled vehicle for 1990 but could manage only . In 1991, he tried again, but once again, he had to give up on handling problems.

<doc id="1088493" wikidata="Q2072377" url="?curid=1088493" title="List of military leaders in the American Revolutionary War">
<text>Several military leaders played a role in the American Revolutionary War. This is a compilation of some of the most important leaders among the many participants in the war. Militia: a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency or a body of citizens organized for military service. In order to be listed here an individual must satisfy one of the following criteria:
* Was a nation&#x27;s top civilian responsible for directing military affairs
* Held a commission of at least brigadier general or rear admiral in an organized military during the conflict
* Was the highest-ranking member of a given nation&#x27;s force that participated in the conflict (if that rank was not at least major general)
* Was the highest-ranking member of a given state/colonial militia
* Was a provincial or territorial governor who is documented to have directed a military action
* Was a Native American tribal leader who had a documented leadership position in military action
Some individuals held concurrent positions in more than one organization, and a number of Continental Army generals also held high-ranking positions in their state militia organizations

== United States ==

When the war began, because the American colonists feared a very strong armed force (also known as a &quot;standing army&quot;), each colony had traditionally provided its own defense through the use of local militia. Each of which had their own command hierarchy. Some states, most notably Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, also had their own navies.

Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the Continental Congress established (on paper) a regular army—the Continental Army—in June 1775, and appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war.

This act was Initially hailed as heroic, he was subsequently censured by Congress in August 1776, and was relieved of his command in January 1778.
* James Nicholson of Virginia was the designated Senior Captain in the Navy for political reasons in October 1776. He was the senior officer in the navy after Commodore Hopkins&#x27;s relief in 1778, but never exercised command over the whole navy because it had ceased to operate as an organized fleet.
* Abraham Whipple was a commodore in the Continental Navy. In one of the first military actions of the revolution in 1772, Whipple led 50 Rhode Islanders in the capture and burning of the British revenue cutter &quot;Gaspee&quot;.

==Great Britain==
At the head of the British forces was the King, George III. From 1772 to 1778 the office of Commander-in-Chief was vacant, but from 1778 to 1782 Sir Jeffery Amherst held the post, with the title of general on the Staff. He was succeeded in February 1782 by Henry Seymour Conway.

Next in importance to the Commander-in-Chief was the Secretary at War, who served as head of the War Office, and was bidden &quot;to observe and follow such orders and directions as he should from time to time receive from the King or the general of the forces&quot;. Not until 1783 was he a minister responsible to parliament. At the start of part of the war the secretary was Lord Barrington. He was replaced in 1778 by Charles Jenkinson who held this position until the fall of Lord North&#x27;s government.

===Crown and Government officials===
* King George III of Great Britain
* Frederick North, Lord North, Prime Minister (1770–1782)
* Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, Prime Minister (1782, died in office)
* William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, Prime Minister (1782–1783)
* George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies (1775–1782)
* John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty

===Commander-in-Chief of the Forces===
* Office vacant from 1772 to 1778
* Sir Jeffery Amherst (1778–1782)
* The Hon. Henry Seymour Conway (1782–1793)

===Secretaries at War===
* William Wildman Shute Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington
* Charles Jenkinson

===Commander-in-Chief, North America===

Until the war was widened into a global conflict by France&#x27;s entry in 1778, the war&#x27;s military activities were primarily directed by the Commander-in-Chief, North America.
* General Thomas Gage was commander-in-chief of North American forces from 1763 until 1775, and governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1774 to 1776. He presided over the rising tensions (with his actions sometimes contributing to them, in the opinions of some historians) that led to the outbreak of the war. He was recalled after the Battle of Bunker Hill.
* General William Howe replaced Gage, and personally directed the war effort in 1776 and 1777, including the British captures of New York City and Philadelphia. He failed to gain control over New Jersey, and his actions in taking Philadelphia contributed to the failure of John Burgoyne&#x27;s Saratoga campaign. He resigned in early 1778.
* Sir Henry Clinton served as commander-in-chief from 1778 to 1782. He oversaw the British army&#x27;s retreat from Philadelphia, and then directed the Siege of Charleston, the landing of a large body of troops early in the &quot;Southern strategy&quot;. He directed most British activities afterward from his base in New York, and played a role in negotiating Benedict Arnold&#x27;s change of allegiance. Following Cornwallis&#x27; surrender at Yorktown, he was replaced by Guy Carleton.
* Sir Guy Carleton was governor of Quebec from 1768 to 1777, overseeing the province&#x27;s defense against the 1775 invasion, and its first counterattack. Denied command of what became John Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign, he resigned in 1777. In 1782, King George appointed him to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief. He directed the withdrawal of British troops from the states and helped to organize the relocation of thousands of Loyalists to other British territories.

===Lieutenant and Major Generals===
* Mariot Arbuthnot was Vice-Admiral of the Blue in the Royal Navy, and commanded its North American station from 1779 until 1781.

<text>The pennaceous feather is a type of feather present in most modern birds and in some other species of maniraptoriform dinosaurs.

== Description ==
A pennaceous feather has a stalk or quill. Its basal part, called a &quot;calamus&quot;, is embedded in the skin. The calamus is hollow and has pith formed from the dry remains of the feather pulp, and the calamus opens below by an &quot;inferior umbilicus&quot; and above by a &quot;superior umbilicus&quot;. The stalk above the calamus is a solid &quot;rachis&quot; having an umbilical groove on its underside. Pennaceous feathers have a rachis with &quot;vanes&quot; or &quot;vaxillum &quot; spreading to either side. These vanes are composed of a high number of flattened &quot;barbs&quot;, that are connected to one another with &quot;barbules&quot;.

The barbules are tiny strands that criss-cross on the flattened sides of the barbs. This forms a miniature velcro-like mesh that holds all the barbs together, stabilizing the vanes.

Pennaceous feathers on the wing, and elsewhere, where stresses related to flight, or other activities, are high, are accordingly attached especially strongly. This strong attachment is accomplished by ligaments under the skin, which in some birds and other feathered dinosaurs results in raised bumps or marks along the rear forelimb bone (ulna). These bumps, called quill knobs (ulnar papillae), are often used as an indirect indication of strongly-attached forelimb feathers in fossil species, and can also indirectly indicate the number of secondary flight feathers in a given specimen.

Flight feathers (remiges and rectrices) are specialized types of pennaceous feathers, adapted for high loadings and often strongly asymmetric for improved flight performance.

<text>Eugene Dynarski (September 13, 1933 – February 27, 2020) was an American actor. Three of the most popular projects that he has been involved with were two Steven Spielberg films, &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, and the Westwood Studios computer game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot;.

==Acting career==
Dynarski acted on stage before he began working in films and on television.

In 1971&#x27;s &quot;Duel&quot;, Dynarski had a small role as a truck driver in a cafe that was mistakenly identified by car driver David Mann (Dennis Weaver) as his tormenting truck driver that resulted in a short-lived fight at Chuck&#x27;s Cafe. In &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot;, Dynarski plays a major supporting role as Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, appearing throughout much of the game&#x27;s Soviet campaign and, to a lesser extent, the Allied campaign. In the 1974 film &quot;Earthquake&quot;, Dynarski portrays Fred, a worker at the Mulholland Dam who becomes the first fatality of the disaster.

Dynarski also appeared in numerous television shows. He was one of 32 actors or actresses to have guest-starred in both the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (episodes &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; and &quot;The Mark of Gideon&quot;) and in one of the series&#x27; spin offs (&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;″s &quot;11001001&quot;). In &quot;Monkees&quot; TV series, Dynarski played the Dragonman&#x27;s sidekick, Toto, in the episode titled &quot;Monkee Chow Mein&quot; (original US air date: March 13, 1967). His many other TV credits include episodes of &quot;Batman&quot; (episodes 47 and 48), &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;. 

Dynarski is also known for his two appearances as Izzy Mandelbaum Jr. on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and as Helmut Jitters in the short film &quot;Apple Jack.&quot;

His final role was in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Patience&quot;. As pivotal character Ernie Stefaniuk, his performance was called heartrending and unforgettable. 

Dynarski and David Weitz, a friend, built the Gene Dynarski Theater, which opened June 20, 1979, in Los Angeles. Over years they converted a bare four-walled space into a 99-seat theater.

==Death==
Dynarski died on February 27, 2020, in Studio City, Los Angeles, at the age of 86.

<text>Bélchú (Old Irish &quot;dog-mouth&quot;, also spelled Bealchu or Bealcu) of Breifne is a warrior of Connacht in the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology.

According to legend, Bélchú finds the Ulster hero Conall Cernach close to death after his final combat with Cet mac Mágach, takes him home and tends to his wounds, intending to fight him when Conall is fit enough. As Conall recuperates, Bélchú regrets this honourable behaviour and tells his three sons to kill Conall as he sleeps in his sickbed. Conall overhears and makes Bélchú take his place in the bed, so when the sons arrive, they kill their father instead. Conall then kills the three sons, and takes all four heads home. You can also find Bélchú referenced in The Glenmasan Manuscript. The story is known as &quot;Argain Belcon Breifne&quot; or as &quot;Togail Bruidne Bélchon Bréifne&quot; (Massacre of Belcu Brefne). The site of the conflict is now the modern-day village of Belcoo, on the border of Counties Cavan and Fermanagh, which is reputedly named after Bélchú, although there are several colourful alternatives.
