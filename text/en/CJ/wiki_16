<text>Pilar do Sul is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba. The population is 29,402 (2020 est.) in an area of 681.12 km². The elevation is 689 m.

== History ==

The history of Pilar do Sul city began in 1850, when drovers, hunters and miners passed through the region to search precious metals. The place name may derive from the fact that many families from the state of Minas Gerais came to the locality to acquire stones that they used to make pestles to tenderize meat. In Portuguese the word &quot;Pilar&quot; means “to pestle.” The local stone was also used for tanning leather of hunted animals. Another possible source of the city’s name may stem from the religiosity of those Minas Gerais’ families, who had great devotion to Our Lady of Pilar, a Spanish Saint.

In 1865, Lieutenant Almeida acquired an allotment in the region and brought slaves to build a farm, and after that he built a small chapel in honor of Bom Jesus do Bomfim, to which he was devoted. In 1868, the lieutenant gave the land to the Diocese of Sorocaba. In 1877, João Batista Ribeiro, with permission of the bishop at the time, founded the town of Pilar, raising the town to the category of parish by a providential law. On May 12, 1891, through a decree, the town became a municipality, and on 20th of the same month stewardship of the town was established, with Eusebio de Moraes Cunha named as the first mayor of Pilar.

The city was slow to develop during the twentieth century. The poor roads and the sluggish growth of agriculture caused stagnation and the loss of political autonomy, with the town becoming a district of Piedade city in 1934. On November 5, 1936, Pilar regained its autonomy as a town. In March of the following year, Eugenio Theodoro Sobrinho took office as first elected mayor. In the same year, the House of Councilors passed a law that gave away lands within the town to all who wanted to build buildings of any kind. In 1944, the city officially changed its name to “Pilar do Sul.&quot;

Recently, Pilar do Sul has grown every year, giving greater emphasis to agricultural development, which is responsible for 70% of the municipal economy. Tourism, largely attributable to the beauty of local natural springs known as the &quot;Spring of Waters,&quot; has also begun to develop, providing a boost to the city’s economy.

<doc id="1084066" wikidata="Q884769" url="?curid=1084066" title="BEEP">
<text>The Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) is a framework for creating network application protocols. BEEP includes building blocks like framing, pipelining, multiplexing, reporting and authentication for connection and message-oriented peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols with support of asynchronous full-duplex communication.

Message syntax and semantics is defined with BEEP profiles associated to one or more BEEP channels, where each channel is a full-duplex pipe. A framing-mechanism enables simultaneous and independent communication between peers.

BEEP is defined in independently from the underlying transport mechanism. The mapping of BEEP onto a particular transport service is defined in a separate series of documents.

== Overview ==

Profiles, channels and a framing mechanism are used in BEEP to exchange different kinds of messages. Only content type and encoding are defaulted by the specification leaving the full flexibility of using a binary or textual format open to the protocol designer. Profiles define the functionality of the protocol and the message syntax and semantics. Channels are full-duplex pipes connected to a particular profile. Messages sent through different channels are independent from each other (asynchronous). Multiple channels can use the same profile through one connection.

BEEP also includes TLS for encryption and SASL for authentication.

== History ==
In 1998 Marshall T. Rose, who also worked on the POP3, SMTP, and SNMP protocols, designed the BXXP protocol and subsequently handed it over to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) workgroup in summer 2000. In 2001 the IETF published BEEP () and BEEP on TCP () with some enhancements to BXXP. The three most notable are:

* Using application/octet-stream as the default &quot;Content-Type&quot;
* Support multi-reply for messages
* Changing the name from BXXP to BEEP

== BEEP session ==

To start a BEEP session, an initiating peer connects to the listening peer. Each peer sends a reply containing a greeting element. The greeting contains up to three different elements:

* features: optional channel management profile feature tokens supported by the peer.
* localize: optional preferred language tags for reporting and messages.
* profile : profiles supported by the peer.

Example greeting and answer:
L: &lt;wait for incoming connection&gt;
I: &lt;open connection&gt;
L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
L: 
L: &lt;greeting&gt;
L: &lt;profile uri=&#x27;http://iana.org/beep/TLS&#x27; /&gt;
L: &lt;/greeting&gt;
L: END
I: RPY 0 0 . 0 52
I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
I: 
I: &lt;greeting /&gt;
I: END
== Profiles ==

Profiles define the syntax and semantics of messages and the protocol functionality based on BEEP. A single BEEP session can provide access to multiple profiles. To identify a profile, a unique string is assigned to it. This profile identifier has the format of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or Uniform Resource Name (URN). In the past, the URI format of the profile identifier lead to confusion, because it is similar to a web address. To avoid misunderstandings, newer profiles should use the URN format.

Example profile identifier:

== Messages and frames ==

BEEP messages are structured according to the MIME standard. There are sometimes misunderstandings about BEEP using XML in messages, but only a small subset of XML is used by channel 0 and it is transparent to the profile designer (BEEP user). It&#x27;s up to the profile designer which message content format is used. This can be any textual format like JSON or XML as well as binary data. XML is used in the channel management and the TLS standard profile defined with BEEP.

Example of a successful channel close message exchange from RFC3080.
C: MSG 0 2 . 235 71
C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
C: 
C: &lt;close number=&#x27;1&#x27; code=&#x27;200&#x27; /&gt;
C: END
S: RPY 0 2 . 392 46
S: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
S: 
S: &lt;ok /&gt;
S: END
Larger messages are split into multiple parts and distributed over a number of sequence frames.

=== Exchange types ===

BEEP defines 5 message types to allow most of the application protocol patterns needed:

Some of the most common application protocol patterns are implemented as follows:

* Request-reply using MSG for request and RPY and ERR for replies 
* Single request-multiple replies using MSG, and a series of ANS replies ended by a NUL frame
* Unacknowledged notification using MSG without a reply

=== Flow control ===

BEEP supports sequence frames (SEQ) to implement flow control at the channel level. Sequence frames are defined in RFC 3081 section 3.3.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) defines a sequence mechanism on the transport layer level and supports flow control related to the connection.
BEEP needs flow control on the channel level to make sure no channel or big message monopolizes the connection. To that end, sequence frames are used to support quality of service (QoS) and to avoid starvation and deadlock.

<doc id="1084072" wikidata="Q4986363" url="?curid=1084072" title="Buick V8 engine">
<text>The Buick V8 is a family of V8 engines produced by the Buick division of General Motors (GM) between 1953 and 1981. All were 90° water-cooled V8 OHV pushrod engines, and all were naturally aspirated except one turbocharged version of the 215.

The Buick V8 family can be divided into two sizes, big-blocks and small-blocks (block size classification refers to the engine block&#x27;s bore spacing and external dimensions, not displacement). All 1953–1966 Buick V8s and the 1967–1976 &quot;big-block&quot; engines shared a bore spacing. The small-block was produced from 1961 to 1981.

Some Buick V8s, such as the 350, 400, and 455, have the same displacements as V8s of other GM divisions, but they are entirely different designs. Buick Nailhead V8s can be distinguished by the top surfaces of their valve covers being horizontal (parallel to the ground). Later Buick small and big block V8s have a front-mounted distributor tilted to the drivers side (like Cadillacs), but siamesed center exhaust ports (unlike Cadillacs).

==First-generation Nailhead==

Buick&#x27;s first generation V8 was offered from 1953 through 1956; it replaced the Buick straight-eight. While officially called the &quot;Fireball V8&quot; by Buick, it became known by enthusiasts as the &quot;Nailhead&quot; for the unusual vertical alignment of its small-sized valves (Originally it was known to hot-rodders as the &quot;nail valve&quot;, because the engine&#x27;s small heads contained valves with long stems, which made them look like nails.)

During this era, Buick ranked smoothness above most other marketing objectives, and the Dynaflow transmission&#x27;s non-shifting design was demonstrably smoother than the other rough shifting automatics then available. With the Dynaflow, a high torque engine was needed to provide adequate acceleration, so that&#x27;s what the Nailhead was designed to deliver. 

Both the intake and exhaust valves were on the intake manifold side of a &quot;pent-roof combustion chamber&quot;. To offset restrictive port diameters and the smaller-sized valves [ intake, exhaust], the Nailhead V8s used a camshaft with greater lift and duration. The small-diameter intake runners allowed these engines to develop high torque, with many exceeding 1 ft-lb/cu in (exceptional for the time).

First-generation Nailheads were painted &quot;Late&quot; Buick Green (also called Apple Green, used from 1953 to 1965).

===264===
The produced in 1954 and 1955 was a direct replacement for the 263 straight-eight and the only engine available in Buick&#x27;s economy &quot;Special&quot; series vehicles. It was the smallest displacement Nailhead, sharing stroke and deck height with the 322, but having its own smaller bore .

===322===
The larger was the original Nailhead, used by Buick from 1953 through 1956 in the Roadmaster, Super, and Century models, and the Special in 1956. It has a bore and stroke of .

The 322 was also used in the 1956 through 1957 10,000-Series conventional-cab Chevrolet heavy duty trucks labeled as the &quot;Loadmaster&quot;.

==Second-generation Nailhead==
Buick&#x27;s second variation of the &quot;Nailhead&quot; was produced from 1957–1966. The &quot;Fireball&quot; name was dropped after 1957, but the 364 was very briefly called the &quot;B-12000&quot;, referring to the 12,000 foot pounds generated by each piston. Second generation Nailheads were painted &quot;Late&quot; Buick Green, with the exception of those installed in the 1963 Riviera, which were silver, and the 1966 Riviera, which were red.

===364===
Buick, like most of its competitors, continued to expand their V8 engine to larger displacements. The was introduced in 1957 and produced through 1961, with a (bore by stroke). The Special series cars came standard with the two-barrel carburetor version, where all other models got the four-barrel engine. 

===401 (400)===

The 364 was enlarged to and produced from 1959 to 1966. Bore and stroke were enlarged to respectively. Originally labelled a 401, it was later redesignated &quot;400&quot; (with no change to displacement) to meet 1960s GM directives for maximum allowable engine displacements in mid-size cars.

The 401/400 became Buick&#x27;s muscle car powerplant of choice, used in the company&#x27;s Skylark Gran Sport, Buick Sport Wagon and Buick Wildcat models, among others. The engine was variously designated the Wildcat 375, Wildcat 410, and Wildcat 445 depending on the torque each version produced. The Wildcat 410 was the two-barrel carbureted engine, standard on the 1962-63 LeSabre. The Wildcat 375 was a no-cost option for the 1962-63 LeSabre that used a lower compression ratio to run on lower-octane fuel. The various Wildcat engines had decals on their air cleaners indicating their version; however, the four-barrel edition of the 1966-67 small-block Buick 340 V8 was also labeled Wildcat 375 on its air cleaner, but was not a Nailhead.

The Wildcat 445, with a single four-barrel carburetor, was the standard engine in the Invicta, 1959-1966 Electra, 1962–1966 Buick Wildcat, 1963 Riviera, and 1965 Riviera (the 1964 and 1966 Riviera models used the 425 with a single four-barrel carburetor, labeled Wildcat 465, as standard equipment).

In an effort to overcome the restrictive exhaust-port design of the Nailhead, Buick drag racing enthusiasts in the 1960s adapted superchargers with a custom camshaft to feed intake air in through the exhaust ports; the larger intake ports became the exhaust outlets.

===425===

The was produced from 1963 to 1966. Its bore and stroke measured . The largest-displacement version of the Nailhead, it began as an option on the 1963 Riviera, and was later available on the Wildcat and Electra models. The 1964 and 1966 Rivieras used the 425 engine as standard equipment. Mounted on a trolley, Buick 425s were also used as starter motors for the SR-71 Blackbird supersonic jet.

Four-barrel carburetion was standard on the basic 425, called the Wildcat 465 for the torque (as measured in lb-ft) it developed. The Super Wildcat (Regular Production Option {RPO}-coded Y48) was available on the 1964 Riviera as a factory option (2,122 produced), 1964 Electras (any model, production numbers unknown), 1965 Riviera Gran Sport and 1966 Wildcat GS, which included two four-barrel carburetors and matching intake manifold. Coded &quot;MW&quot;, these parts were delivered in the car&#x27;s trunk for dealer installation. Toward the end of the 1966 model year, around May 1966, Buick offered the Super Wildcat 465 with factory-installed 
dual four-barrel Carter AFB carburetors as an &quot;MZ&quot; option. Only 179 of the 1966 Riviera GS cars were built with the MZ package.
==Big-block==
Buick introduced its &quot;Big Block&quot; V8 in 1967 to replace the largest displacement Nailheads. It retained the cylinder bore spacing and was produced in three displacements: 400, 430, and 455 cubic inches. Production continued through 1976.

=== 400===
The big-block V8 was produced from 1967-1969. This engine has a bore and a stroke of . It was the only large V8 engine available for the intermediate-sized A-body Buicks due to the GM cubic inch limit restriction in effect through 1970. Most parts except the pistons interchange with the 430 and 455. This 400 engine had the distributor towards the front of the engine, as opposed to the 401/400 nailhead, which had its near the firewall.

===430===

The was only produced from 1967 until 1969. This engine had a bore and a stroke of . The 430 four-barrel engine was rated at and of torque. This engine was used in large B-, C- and E-body Buicks. Most parts except the pistons interchange with the 400 and 455.

Applications:
*1967-1969 Buick Electra
*1967-1969 Buick Riviera
*1967-1969 Buick Wildcat
===455===
The 400-based 455 was produced from 1970–1976, with a bore x stroke of for an overall displacement of . Most parts (except pistons and heads) interchange between the 400 and the 430. The base model was rated at , while the 455 Stage 1 equipped with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor was rated at at 4600 rpm. The regular 455 produced a rated of torque at 2,800 rpm, more than any other muscle car engine. The horsepower was somewhat reduced in 1971 mainly due to the reduction in cylinder compression ratio, a change which was mandated by GM in order to cope with the introduction of new federal laws which would require new cars to use low octane gasoline in an effort to reduce exhaust emissions. Then, starting in 1972, the horsepower rating on paper would be reduced again due to a shift from SAE gross to SAE net, down to approximately . Unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters came into play in 1975 for all US manufactured cars. Tightening emissions controls would cause the engine to drop in power still further, a little at a time, through 1976.

The 455 was one of the first &quot;thin-wall casting&quot; engine blocks at GM, and because of this advance in production technology, it weighs significantly less than other engines of comparable size (for example, less than a Chevrolet 454 and only more than a Chevrolet 350).
Applications:
*1970-1976 Buick Electra
*1970-1976 Buick Estate
*1970-1976 Buick LeSabre
*1970-1976 Buick Riviera
*1970-1972 Buick Skylark
*1970 Buick Wildcat
*1971-1973 Buick Centurion
*1973-1974 Buick Century
*1973-1974 Buick Gran Sport
*1973-1974 Buick Regal
==Small-block==
Buick introduced a &quot;small block&quot; V8 in 1961 with a cylinder bore spacing; it was produced in four displacements, 215, 300, 340, and 350. This design also became the basis of a highly successful cast iron V6 engine, the Fireball. Design features include an external oil pump, a forward-mounted distributor, and an integrated aluminum timing cover which incorporates the oil pump mechanisms, leaving the oil filter exposed to oncoming air for added cooling.

With the exception of the silver 1964 300, Buick small-blocks were painted &quot;Late&quot; Buick Green through 1966. Buick engines were painted red from 1967-1974, medium metallic blue from 1975-1977, and light blue from 1978-1982.

The small-block was originally produced as an industry-first all-aluminum engine. Alas, after 3 years of production, persisting cylinder liner issues, trumped with new and cheaper thin-wall iron casting techniques, pushed a change to an iron block.

===215===
:&quot;See also Rover V8 engine&quot;

GM experimented with aluminum engines starting in the early 1950s, when Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) was pushing all automakers to use more aluminum. An early-development supercharged version of the V8 was used in the 1951 Le Sabre concept car, and the 1953 Buick Roadmaster concept car.

GM designated Buick as engine design leader, and work on a production unit commenced in 1956. Originally intended for displacement, Buick decided on a larger, size, deemed ideal for the new Y-body cars introduced for 1961, like the Skylark.

Known as the Buick Fireball, the 215 had a bore and a stroke of , for an actual displacement of . With its aluminum cylinder heads and cylinder block, at the time it was the lightest mass-production V8 in the world, with a dry weight of only . Measuring long, wide, and high (same as the small-block Chevy), it became standard equipment in the 1961 Buick Special.

At introduction, Buick&#x27;s 215 was rated at 4400 rpm. This was raised soon after introduction to at 4,600 rpm. of torque was produced at 2,400 rpm with a Rochester 2GC (2 Jet) two-barrel carburetor and 8.8:1 compression ratio. A mid-year introduction was the Buick Special Skylark version, which had 10.0:1 compression and a four-barrel carburetor, raising output to at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm.

For 1962, the four-barrel-equipped engine&#x27;s compression ratio was increased to 10.25:1 and horsepower to at 4,800 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. The two-barrel engine was unchanged. For 1963, the four-barrel was bumped to 11.0:1 compression and an even at 5,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm, /cu in. The higher output &quot;Power Pack&quot; was equipped with higher lift camshaft .0.518&quot; intake/ 0.523&quot; exhaust with increased duration 305/310 and required 99 research octane fuel.

====Pontiac usage====
Pontiac used the Buick version of the 215 in its Y-body cars, the Tempest and LeMans. At that time the engine was closely associated with the Buick brand, and Pontiac sold few cars with it, using it only in 1961 and 1962.

====Oldsmobile version====
Although sharing basic architecture with the Buick, Oldsmobile developed its own all-aluminum 215, the &quot;Rockette V8&quot;, to install in its F-85 Cutlass Y-body. Its angled valve covers were designed by Oldsmobile engineers to look like a traditional Olds V8.

Olds also released a turbocharged version, the Turbo-Rocket, in its 1962–63 Oldsmobile Jetfire. Together with Chevrolet&#x27;s turbocharged 1962 Corvair Spyder, these were the first turbochargers ever offered in passenger cars.

Produced on a separate assembly line, the Olds 215 was somewhat heavier at . Intended to alleviate a head-warping problem on high-compression versions, Oldsmobile added a sixth head bolt on the intake manifold side. This meant that the five-bolt Buick heads would fit on Oldsmobile blocks, but not vice versa. The Oldsmobile used wedge-shaped/quench combustion chambers/pistons that allowed larger valves, while the Buick had a 37-cc wedge combustion chamber and used &quot;dished head&quot; pistons. Altering the compression ratio on the Oldsmobile 215 required changing the heads, but on a Buick 215, only the pistons were changed, which was less expensive and simpler.

====Discontinuation====
Casting-sealing technology was not advanced enough at that time, and hidden porosity problems caused serious oil leaks, producing an abnormally high scrap ratio. The factory had to make extensive use of air gauging for leak checks, and was unable to detect leaks on blocks that were as much as 95% complete. This raised the cost of complete engines to more than that of a comparable all cast-iron engine, so aluminum blocks were cancelled after the 1963 model year. Another problem was clogged radiators from antifreeze mixtures incompatible with aluminum.

====Racing====
The 215&#x27;s very high power-to-weight ratio made it immediately interesting for automobile and boat racing. Mickey Thompson entered a stock-block 215-powered car in the 1962 Indianapolis 500, the first stock-block engine since 1946 and the only non-Offenhauser-powered entry in the race. Rookie driver Dan Gurney qualified eighth and raced well for 92 laps before retiring with transmission problems.

Surplus engine blocks of the Oldsmobile F85 version formed the basis of the Australian Formula One Repco V8 used by Brabham to win the 1966 Formula One world championship, although only the earliest engines had any Oldsmobile components. The majority of Repco RB620 engines were cast and built in-house at Repco.

====Sale to Rover====
Rights to these engines were purchased by the British Rover Company and used in the 1967 Rover P5B that replaced the 3 L straight six Rover engined P5. Throughout the years, the Rover Company (which became part of British Leyland in 1968), and its successor companies constantly improved the engine making it much stronger and more reliable. Capacities ranged from . This engine was used for V8 versions of the MGB GT known as the GTV8. Rover also used the engine in the 1970 Range Rover. Morgan used the Rover version in its Plus 8. American 215s have also been engine swapped into countless other platforms, especially Chevrolet Vegas and later British cars including the MG RV8 in the 1990s, Triumph TR8, and various sports sedans and sports cars by the MG Rover Group and specialist manufacturers such as TVR. The engine remains well-supported by enthusiast clubs, specialist parts suppliers, and by shops that specialize in conversions and tuning.

===300===
In 1964, Buick replaced the 215 with an iron-block engine of very similar architecture. The new &quot;small block&quot; engine had a bore of and a stroke of for a displacement of . It retained the aluminum cylinder heads, intake manifold, and accessories of the 215 for a dry weight of . The 300 was offered in two-barrel form, with 9.0:1 compression, making at 4600 rpm and at 2400 rpm, and four-barrel form, with 11.0:1 compression, making at 4800 rpm and at 3000 rpm.

For 1965, the 300 switched to cast-iron heads, raising dry weight to , still quite light for a V8 engine of its era. The four-barrel option was cancelled for 1966, and the 300 was replaced entirely by the 350 in 1968.

In 1964, while nearly all Buick engines were painted &quot;Buick Late Green&quot;, the 300 V8s were painted silver instead. In 1966 Buick engines switched to &quot;Buick Late Red&quot;, but until 1967 at least, the 300 V8 (and the 225) were still painted Buick Late Green. The Apollo 5000 GT sports car, (also sold as the Vetta Ventura) used this engine.

===340===
In 1966, the 300&#x27;s stroke was increased to in a raised block to create the &quot;340&quot;, displacing , as a replacement for the four-barrel-carbureted 300. The taller deck (raised by compared to the 215/300&#x27;s) meant the intake manifold was of a new design to bolt to the otherwise interchangeable cylinder heads.

It was offered with two- or four-barrel carburetion, the two-barrel with a 9.0:1 compression rated at at 4,000 rpm and at 2,400 rpm, and the four barrel with 10.25:1 compression, rated at at 4,000 rpm and at 2,800 rpm. It was only produced through 1967, being replaced by the new small block in 1968.

===350===

Buick adopted the popular 350 size in 1968 for their final family of V8 engines, which was produced through 1980. Although it shared the displacement of the other GM small blocks, including the Chevrolet 350, Oldsmobile 350, and Pontiac 350, the Buick blocks were of a substantially different proprietary company design. The Buick 350 featured the same bore as the version of the Buick 90° V6 and retained the stroke of the previous V8. The exact displacement is .

The major differences of the 350 in comparison to other GM V8s are Buick&#x27;s &quot;deep-skirt&quot; engine block construction, the use of cast iron with increased nickel content, under-square cylinder bore sizing, crankshaft main journals, and connecting rods. Of all the GM &quot;350s&quot;, the Buick has the longest piston stroke. This design characteristic made the engine significantly wider than the others — essentially the same as the Buick big-blocks, which have the shortest stroke of the GM big-blocks. The engine garnered a reputation as rugged and durable, and some of its design characteristics are found in other Buick-designed GM engines, such as the V6 and its 3800 descendants.

The 350 was used by Kaiser-Jeep and AMC Jeep in the Jeep Gladiator and Wagoneer models from 1968–71; in these applications, the engine was billed as the Dauntless V8.

==Other GM V8s used in Buicks==
In the mid-1970s, Buick&#x27;s 455 big block became unable to meet fuel economy/emission requirements and was phased out, with the Buick 350 remaining as a factory option until 1980. In their place a variety of other GM divisions&#x27; V8s were offered, both as standard equipment and factory options. These included:

===Oldsmobile 260===
The  was an Oldsmobile V8 engine shared with Buick:
*1975–1977 Buick Skylark

From the 1950s-1970s, each GM division had its own V8 engine family. Many were shared among other divisions, but each design is most-closely associated with its own division:
*Cadillac V8 engine
*Chevrolet Small-Block engine
*Chevrolet Big-Block engine
*Oldsmobile V8 engine
*Pontiac V8 engine
*Holden V8 engine

GM later standardized on the later generations of the Chevrolet design:
*GM LT engine — Generation II small-block
*GM LS engine — Generation III/IV small-block

<text>George Sidney Simpson (September 21, 1908 – December 2, 1961) was an American sprinter. He competed at the 1932 Olympics and won a silver medal in the 200 m, placing fourth in the 100 m event. Simpson was the first to run 100 yards in 9.4 seconds, but because he used starting blocks, the record was never ratified. He won the in both NCAA and AAU in 1930. He was also fourth in the 100 meters at the 1932 Olympics. In 1929 he unofficially equaled the 200 meters World Record 20.6 seconds. Simpson attended Ohio State and won a national title in 1929.

<text>Martin Ebon (May 27, 1917 – February 11, 2006) was the pen-name of Hans Martin Schwarz, an American journalist and author of non-fiction books and articles from the paranormal to politics, particularly as an anti-communist.

==Background==
Hans Martin Schwarz was born on May 27, 1917, in Hamburg, Germany. 

==Career==
During the 1930s, Schwarz published in &quot;Israelitisches Familienblatt&quot; among other German-Jewish periodicals.

In 1938, Schwarz emigrated to the USA, lived in New York City from 1938 onwards, and changed his name from Hans Martin Schwartz to Martin Ebon. 

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Office of War Information (formed June 1942), the U.S. Department of State (as an information officer), and by 1948 had joined the staff of &quot;Partisan Review&quot; magazine.

In January 1948, Ebon published his first book in English, &quot;World Communism Today&quot;. The book reviewed a century of Marxism, following the publication of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. praised the book as an &quot;outstanding work on communist penetration and strategy.&quot; The book was cited as an expert source, e.g., 60,000 members in the Korean Communist Party as of 1949. In March 1948, he appeared on WMAL AM radio in Washington, DC, to discuss &quot;Which Way America – Fascism, Communism, Socialism, or Democracy?&quot; with Raymond Moley (Conservative), Norman Thomas (Socialist), and Leon Milton Birkhead (Unitarian). His July 1948 article &quot;Communist Tactics in Palestine&quot; in the &quot;Middle East Journal&quot; received a favorably review as &quot;carefully documented&quot; and &quot;objective and non-partisan.&quot; In 1953, his book &quot;Malenkov: Stalin&#x27;s Successor&quot; received mixed reviews as &quot;short,&quot; quickly published (weeks after Stalin&#x27;s death), and carefully appraising thanks to the author&#x27;s previous book on world communism. It drew favorable comparison to Eugene Lyons&#x27; &quot;Our Secret Allies&quot;.

Ebon held various positions in book and magazine retailing, including:
* Managing Editor of foreign language division, Overseas News Agency; U.S. Information Agency, New York City
* Information Officer on Far Eastern desks, 1950–52; Hill &amp; Knowlton, Inc. (public relations), New York City
* Account Executive, 1952–53; Parapsychology Foundation, Inc., New York City, administrative secretary and editor, 1953–65, working closely with its founder, Eileen J. Garrett
* Lombard Associates, Inc. (public relations and publications consultants), New York City, president, 1962–82
* Consulting Editor, New American Library (publishers), 1966–83
* Executive Editor of hardcover book division, Playboy Press, 1971–72
* Lecturer in Division of Social Sciences, The New School, 1949–50, 1955–56, 1967
* Consultant, Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man, 1966–67
* Free-lance writer from 1967 on

==Personal life and death==

Ebon married Chariklia Baltazzi; they had one son.

Martin Ebon died age 82 on February 11, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Legacy ==

The Center for Jewish History houses articles written by Ebon between 1934 and 1938 for German-Jewish newspapers, plus reviews of his German-language books.

== Works ==
Ebon published dozens of books on world affairs and parapsychology.

<text>James Bayard Turner (March 28, 1941 – June 10, 2023) was an American professional football placekicker who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and Denver Broncos. He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection with the Jets and a member of their Super Bowl III championship team. Turner was chosen for the AFL All-Time Second-team and the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame.

==Career==
Turner was born and raised in Martinez, California. He graduated from John Swett High School in 1959. He played for the football team as a quarterback and was also a freestyle swimmer. Turner attended Utah State University, where he played college football for the Utah State Aggies as both a quarterback and placekicker.

The Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) selected Turner in the 19th round of the 1963 NFL draft. He signed with the Redskins, but failed a tryout with the Redskins and was released. Turner signed with the New York Jets of the American Football League (AFL) as a free agent in 1964. He set then-league records with single-season totals of 145 points and 34 field goals in 1968. Turner kicked for nine points, making two of three field goals, in the AFL Championship Game win over the Oakland Raiders. He had 10 points in the Jets&#x27; 16–7 defeat of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 1968 and 1969.

Following the 1970 season the Jets traded Turner to the Denver Broncos for Bobby Howfield. He scored four points in the Broncos&#x27; losing effort in Super Bowl XII against the Dallas Cowboys, connecting on a 47-yard field goal and an extra point following a touchdown run by Rob Lytle.

Turner finished his career with 304 of 488 (62%) field goals and 521 of 534 extra points, giving him 1,439 total points. Upon his retirement, he ranked second in field goals in NFL history, with only a fellow AFL veteran in George Blanda having more; Turner now ranks in the top 35 for kickers four decades after his career ended. He did not miss a game, playing in 228 consecutive contests. His single-season scoring record was broken by Mark Moseley in 1983, and Ali Haji-Sheikh broke Turner&#x27;s field goal record the same season. He was inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame in 1988 and the Utah State University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013.

<text>&quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; (or &quot;It&#x27;s a Long, Long Way to Tipperary&quot;) is an English music hall song first performed in 1912 by Jack Judge, and written by Judge and Harry Williams, though authorship of the song has long been disputed.

It was recorded in 1914 by Irish tenor John McCormack. It was used as a marching song among soldiers in the First World War and is remembered as a song of that war. Welcoming signs in the town of Tipperary, Ireland, humorously declare &quot;You&#x27;ve come a long way&quot; in reference to the song.

== Authorship ==
Jack Judge&#x27;s parents were Irish, and his grandparents came from Tipperary. Judge met Harry Williams (Henry James Williams, 23 September 1873 – 21 February 1924) in Oldbury, Worcestershire at the Malt Shovel public house, where Williams&#x27;s brother Ben was the licensee. Williams was severely disabled, having fallen down cellar steps as a child and badly broken both legs. He had developed a talent for writing verse and songs, and played the piano and mandolin, often in public. Judge and Williams began a long-term writing partnership that resulted in 32 music hall songs published by Bert Feldman. Many of the songs were composed by Williams and Judge at Williams&#x27;s home, The Plough Inn (later renamed The Tipperary Inn), in Balsall Common. Because Judge could not read or write music, Williams taught them to Judge by ear.

Judge was a popular semi-professional performer in music halls. In January 1912, he was performing at the Grand Theatre in Stalybridge, and accepted a 5-shilling bet that he could compose and sing a new song by the next night. The following evening, 31 January, Judge performed &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; for the first time, and it immediately became a great success. The song was originally written and performed as a sentimental ballad, to be enjoyed by Irish expatriates living in London. Judge sold the rights to the song to Bert Feldman in London, who agreed to publish it and other songs written by Judge with Williams. Feldman published the song as &quot;It&#x27;s a Long, Long Way to Tipperary&quot; in October 1912, and promoted it as a march.

===Dispute===
Feldman paid royalties to both Judge and Williams, but after Williams&#x27; death in 1924, Judge claimed sole credit for writing the song, saying that he had agreed to Williams being co-credited as recompense for a debt that Judge owed. However, Williams&#x27; family showed that the tune and most of the lyrics to the song already existed in the form of a manuscript, &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Way to Connemara&quot;, co-written by Williams and Judge back in 1909, and Judge had used this, just changing some words, including changing &quot;Connemara&quot; to &quot;Tipperary&quot;.

Judge said: &quot;I was the sole composer of &#x27;Tipperary&#x27;, and all other songs published in our names jointly. They were all 95% my work, as Mr Williams made only slight alterations to the work he wrote down from my singing the compositions. He would write it down on music-lined paper and play it back, then I&#x27;d work on the music a little more ... I have sworn affidavits in my possession by Bert Feldman, the late Harry Williams and myself confirming that I am the composer ...&quot;. In a 1933 interview, he added: &quot;The words and music of the song were written in the Newmarket Tavern, Corporation Street, Stalybridge on 31st January 1912, during my engagement at the Grand Theatre after a bet had been made that a song could not be written and sung the next evening ... Harry was very good to me and used to assist me financially, and I made a promise to him that if I ever wrote a song and published it, I would put his name on the copies and share the proceeds with him. Not only did I generously fulfil that promise, but I placed his name with mine on many more of my own published contributions. During Mr Williams&#x27; lifetime (as far as I know) he never claimed to be the writer of the song ...&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s family campaigned in 2012 to have Harry Williams officially re-credited with the song, and shared their archives with the Imperial War Museums. The family estate still receives royalties from the song.

===Other claims===
In 1917, Alice Smyth Burton Jay sued song publishers Chappell &amp; Co. for $100,000, alleging she wrote the tune in 1908 for a song played at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition promoting the Washington apple industry. The chorus began &quot;I&#x27;m on my way to Yakima&quot;. The court appointed Victor Herbert to act as expert advisor and dismissed the suit in 1920, since the authors of &quot;Tipperary&quot; had never been to Seattle and Victor Herbert testified the two songs were not similar enough to suggest plagiarism.

== Content ==
The song was originally written as a lament from an Irish worker in London, missing his homeland. Unlike popular songs of previous wars (such as the Boer Wars), it did not incite soldiers to glorious deeds, instead concentrating on the longing for home (as with the period song &quot;Keep the Home Fires Burning&quot;).

===Lyrics===
&lt;poem&gt;
:Up to mighty London
:Came an Irishman one day.
:All the streets were paved with gold
:So, everyone was gay,
:Singing songs of Piccadilly,
:Strand and Leicester Square,
:Till Paddy got excited,
:and he shouted to them there:

::Chorus
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::It&#x27;s a long way to go.
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::To the sweetest girl I know!
::Goodbye, Piccadilly,
::Farewell, Leicester Square!
::It&#x27;s a long long way to Tipperary,
::But my heart&#x27;s right there.

:Paddy wrote a letter
:To his Irish Molly-O,
:Saying, &quot;Should you not receive it,
:Write and let me know!&quot;
:&quot;If I make mistakes in spelling,
:Molly, dear,&quot; said he,
:&quot;Remember, it&#x27;s the pen that&#x27;s bad,
:Don&#x27;t lay the blame on &quot;me!&quot;&quot;

::Chorus
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::It&#x27;s a long way to go.
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::To the sweetest girl I know!
::Goodbye, Piccadilly,
::Farewell, Leicester Square!
::It&#x27;s a long long way to Tipperary,
::But my heart&#x27;s right there.

:Molly wrote a neat reply
:To Irish Paddy-O,
:Saying &quot;Mike Maloney
:Wants to marry me, and so
:Leave the Strand and Piccadilly
:Or you&#x27;ll be to blame,
:For love has fairly drove me silly:
:Hoping you&#x27;re the same!&quot;

::Chorus
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::It&#x27;s a long way to go.
::It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary,
::To the sweetest girl I know!
::Goodbye, Piccadilly,
::Farewell, Leicester Square!
::It&#x27;s a long long way to Tipperary,
::But my heart&#x27;s right there.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The parody &quot;It&#x27;s the Wrong, Wrong Way to Tickle Mary&quot; was published (as sheet music) by J. Will Callahan and Charles Brown in the United States in 1915. The bawdy lyrics suggest the performances of concert parties on the front lines of the war:

&lt;poem&gt;
::Chorus
::That&#x27;s the wrong way to tickle Mary,
::That&#x27;s the wrong way to kiss.
::Don&#x27;t you know that over here, lad
::They like it best like this.
::Hoo-ray &quot;pour les français&quot;,
::Farewell &quot;Angleterre&quot;.
::We didn&#x27;t know how to tickle Mary,
::But we learnt how over there.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Reception==
Feldman persuaded Florrie Forde to perform the song in 1913, but she disliked it and dropped it from her act. However, it became the hit song of 1913 and was widely popular when the First World War began the following year. British soldiers marching to Mons sang it. &quot;Daily Mail&quot; correspondent George Curnock saw the Irish regiment the Connaught Rangers singing this song as they marched through Boulogne on 13 August 1914, and reported it on 18 August 1914. Soon, every British newspaper had printed the lyrics to the chorus and it became a popular and patriotic tune amongst civilians. However, as soldiers lost their optimism for a quick end to the war they came to abhor the sentimental song and jeered down attempts to start it. F. T. Nettleingham, a veteran and anthologist of songs from the war, noted that the song was &quot;never Tommy&#x27;s song ... never greatly sung&quot; though it was often the subject of parody. That civilians continued to hold it to be the soldiers&#x27; anthem illustrated a gap in understanding and alienated the fighting men.

In November 1914, it was recorded by Irish tenor John McCormack, which helped its worldwide popularity. There was also a popular recording by Mark Sheridan. In the United States, there were popular versions by Billy Murray, the American Quartet, Prince&#x27;s Orchestra, and Albert Farrington.

The media of the time reported that the song was popular among soldiers despite (or because of) its irreverent and non-military theme, and was contrasted with the military and patriotic songs favoured by enemy troops. Commentators considered that the song&#x27;s appeal revealed characteristically British qualities of being cheerful in the face of hardship. &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that &quot;&#x27;Tipperary&#x27; may be less dignified, but it, and whatever else our soldiers may choose to sing will be dignified by their bravery, their gay patience, and their long suffering kindness... We would rather have their deeds than all the German songs in the world.&quot;

==Later performances==

The song was featured as one of the songs in the 1951 film &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot;, the 1960s stage musical and film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;, and the 1970 musical &quot;Darling Lili&quot;, sung by Julie Andrews. It was also sung by the prisoners of war in Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937) and as background music in &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966). It is also the second part (the other two being &quot;Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot;) of the regimental march of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; used it twice, sung by Crow T. Robot in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot; (1996), then sung again for the final television episode. It is also sung by British soldiers in the film &quot;The Travelling Players&quot; (1975) directed by Theo Angelopoulos, and by Czechoslovak soldiers in the movie &quot;Černí baroni&quot; (1992).

It is also featured in &quot;For Me and My Gal&quot; (1942) starring Judy Garland and Gene Kelly and &quot;Gallipoli&quot; (1981) starring Mel Gibson. It was sung by the crew of in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Das Boot&quot; (the arrangement was performed by the Red Army Choir). Morale is boosted in the submarine when the German crew sings the song as they begin patrolling in the North Atlantic Ocean. The crew sings it a second time as they cruise toward home port after near-disaster.

The cast of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; march off screen singing the song at the conclusion of the series&#x27; final episode, after news anchor Ted Baxter (played by Ted Knight) inexplicably recited some of the lyrics on that evening&#x27;s news broadcast.

The song is often cited when documentary footage of the First World War is presented. One example of its use is in the annual television special &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; (1966). Snoopy—who fancies himself a First World War flying ace—dances to a medley of First World War-era songs played by Schroeder. The song is included, and at that point Snoopy falls into a left-right-left marching pace. Schroeder also plays the song in &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot; (1972) at Snoopy&#x27;s send-off party. Also, Snoopy is seen singing the song out loud in a series of strips about his going to the 1968 Winter Olympics. In another strip, Snoopy is walking such a long distance to reach Tipperary that he lies down exhausted and notes, &quot;They&#x27;re right, it is a long way to Tipperary.&quot; On a different occasion, Snoopy walks along and begins to sing the song, only to meet a sign that reads, &quot;Tipperary: One Block.&quot; In a Sunday strip wherein Snoopy, in his World War I fantasy state, walks into Marcie&#x27;s home, thinking it a French café, and falls asleep after drinking all her root beer, she rousts him awake by loudly singing the song.

In 1916, survivors of the sinking of in the Battle of Jutland were identified by their rescuers on because they were singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; in their lifeboat.

In 1942, as the Japanese hell ship &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was sinking, Royal Artillery POWs trapped in the vessel are reported to have sung the song.

<text>The Irish Water Spaniel (Irish: &quot;An Spáinnéar Uisce&quot;) is a breed of dog that is the tallest of the spaniels.

== Description ==
===Appearance===
The Irish Water Spaniel is a sturdy, cobby dog native to Ireland. The coat, consisting of dense curls, sheds very little. A topknot of long, loose curls grows downward from the crown of the head and often covers the eyes, with a &quot;beard&quot; growing at the back of the throat often being accompanied by &quot;sideburns&quot;. The coat colour is a liver-puce to chocolate-brown hue, with a distinct &quot;purple&quot; undertone, not seen in many other breeds. The minimal coat shedding does not mean Irish Water Spaniels are necessarily &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;, although people who may be allergic to dogs could potentially experience less of a reaction to them.

In addition to their coat, the Irish Water Spaniel has several other distinguishing characteristics which places it amongst the more unique breeds, among these the most distinguishing being the smooth &quot;rat tail&quot;, completely free of long hairs (except at the base, where it is covered for 2–3 inches with curls). The face is entirely smooth and, unlike the poodle, should require little or no trimming to stay that way. An Irish Water Spaniel is ruggedly built and, given its name, is bred for the water. The breed has naturally webbed feet which aid in its powerful swimming skills. Altogether, the Irish Water Spaniel presents a picture of a smart, upstanding, strongly-built (but not leggy) dog, combining great intelligence and rugged endurance with a bold, dashing eagerness of temperament.

They are the largest of the Spaniel group. Dogs range in height from 22 to 24 inches (56–61 cm), and weigh 55 to 65 pounds (25–30 kg).

===Temperament===
As with most breeds classed within the American Kennel Club&#x27;s Sporting group, such as the various other spaniels, retrievers, setters, and pointers, the Irish Water Spaniel is, essentially, an active, willing and energetic companion. Similarly to its fellow sporting breeds, it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it undamaged, thus it maintains the natural instincts of loyalty and of wanting to please. The Water Spaniel has a keen sense of being a &quot;team-player&quot;, which makes it a relatively easy breed to train and discipline from a young age. Because of its great intelligence and &quot;quizzical&quot; nature, it has the reputation of being the &quot;clown&quot; of the spaniels, and will often do ordinary things in extraordinary ways. Some individual dogs may be very wary of strangers, if not properly socialised early in life; likewise, not every Irish Water Spaniel can be trusted to get along with cats or small pets, including smaller dogs. Early socialisation and training is a must.

==History==

The modern breed as we know it was developed in Ireland in the 1830s. It is not known from which other breeds Irish Water Spaniels were developed, as the acknowledged father of the breed, Justin McCarthy (from Dublin), left no breeding records. A range of breeds have been suggested, based largely on superficial traits, including the Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog, Barbet, generic &quot;old water dogs&quot;, and the now-extinct English Water Spaniel, as well as the Northern and Southern Water Spaniels. However, whether or not Irish Water Spaniels are antecedents, descendants, or hybrids of these other breeds is a matter of some speculation. It is believed, in Irish folklore, to be the descendant of the mythological cryptid, the &quot;Dobhar-chú&quot;.

==Suitability as a pet==
Irish Water Spaniels may make good family dogs, as they are usually excellent with respectful children and with other pets. They can make good guard dogs if they have been trained to do so, giving off a deep bark, and will protect their human families. Not usually an aggressive dog, Water Spaniels are nonetheless highly alert and sensitive to their surroundings.

All Irish Water Spaniels require a grooming regimen that includes maintaining healthy ears, teeth and nails. The tight double coat of the Irish Water Spaniel sheds lightly, thus many allergy sufferers have found them to be a comfortable breed with which to live or associate. The texture of the hair prevents the coat from becoming tightly woven into fabric and upholstery and any stray hairs are easily removed as they will gather together to form &quot;dust bunnies&quot;. The coat can be maintained by even the novice owner if a regular effort is maintained to keep it clean and free of mats. A thorough combing to the skin should take place every 1–2 weeks to promote healthy skin and to remove any objects from the coat. Scissoring will be required every 6–8 weeks to neaten and shape the coat while regular exposure to water will promote the correct &quot;ringlets&quot; over the body coat.

Although happy to curl up and sleep at home, regular (possibly 2-3 times, daily) walks and exercise excursions are essential for a healthy, content Water Spaniel. An unexercised Water Spaniel may become a naughty, mischievous animal. An ideal home though would be a working environment, where the dogs&#x27; minds, as well as bodies, are exercised. Many Irish Water Spaniel owners work their dogs in the shooting field, in obedience tests, in agility competitions, or in the conformation show ring.

==Irish Water Spaniel Club of Ireland==
The Irish Water Spaniel Club of Ireland is one of the oldest dog clubs in the world, supporting and promoting one of the most distinguished and oldest breed of dog in the world. The club is registered with the Irish Kennel Club.

==Irish Water Spaniel Club of America==
The IWSCA is the AKC parent club for the IWS. The club exists to preserve and protect this rare breed. The Club helps educate owners and breeders and welcomes all members who share our love of this extraordinary, versatile dog. The IWSCA&#x27;s commitment to the health of the Irish Water Spaniel is reflected in its endorsement of transparency in health findings in accordance with organisations such as Orthopedic Foundation of America (OFA), Canine Health Information Center (CHIC), Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Canine Health Foundation.

===IWSCA breeders===
Most of the breeders in the IWSCA belong to the Breeders Education Committee (BEC) The BEC exists to inform and educate IWSCA breeders on issues of health, genetics and breeding practices designed to promote the ongoing health and welfare of the Irish Water Spaniel. To this end the BEC breeders have agreed to a rigorous set of recommended breeding practices such as: open information exchange, health testing in accordance with the Irish Water Spaniel CHIC protocol, collaboration with the IWSCA Health and Genetics Committee, participation in breed-specific health studies, promotion of responsible pet ownership, and responsibility for any puppy they have bred – for the life of that dog. Individual B.E.C. breeders can be found on the IWSCA website.

==IWS Health Foundation==
The IWS Health Foundation&#x27;s aim is to serve the worldwide Irish Water Spaniel community by providing a forum for internet-based collection and circulation of information, research and educational materials relating to the health and life expectancy of the breed, and for anyone with an interest to promote research for the long-term benefit of the breed.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

<doc id="1084104" wikidata="Q656928" url="?curid=1084104" title="Canada Life Centre">
<text>Canada Life Centre (formerly Bell MTS Place) is an indoor arena in downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is the home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Winnipeg Jets and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Manitoba Moose.

The arena stands on the site of the former Eaton&#x27;s Winnipeg store, and is owned and operated by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment. The 440,000 square feet (41,000 m2) building was constructed at a cost of $133.5 million CAD. It opened on November 16, 2004, as MTS Centre, replacing the since-demolished Winnipeg Arena. It has a capacity of 15,321 for hockey and 16,345 for concerts.

==History==
With the bankruptcy of the iconic Eaton&#x27;s retailer, the famed store originally constructed in Winnipeg, various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were suggested, but ultimately the arena was deemed to be the most viable and beneficial to the city&#x27;s struggling downtown by Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray and True North. After a small but emotional resistance to losing the Western Canadian landmark by some locals and the Save the Eaton&#x27;s Coalition, which inspired a &quot;group hug&quot; of the &quot;Big Store&quot; by a reported 180 people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for the new entertainment complex.

The arena officially opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the aging Winnipeg Arena, which had been in operation since 1955. In recognizing Eaton&#x27;s history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of their store that had once graced Portage Avenue. An original store window and Tyndall stone surround is mounted in the arena concourse to house a collection of Eaton&#x27;s memorabilia. In addition, two war memorials were incorporated into the building. The Timothy Eaton statue that was once a main feature of the store is also housed on the concourse of the arena, one floor directly above where it stood on the ground floor of the original Eaton&#x27;s building.

Originally known as the &quot;True North Centre&quot; during its planning and construction stages, it was named MTS Centre as part of a naming rights agreement with Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS). It was renamed Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017, following Bell Canada&#x27;s acquisition of MTS. On June 15, 2021, True North announced that the naming rights had been sold to Winnipeg-based Canada Life Assurance Company under a 10-year agreement, renaming it Canada Life Centre.

==Events==

===Ice hockey===

====American Hockey League====
 The AHL&#x27;s Manitoba Moose were the arena&#x27;s first tenant, from its opening in 2004 to 2011. The team relocated to St. John&#x27;s prior to the 2011–12 AHL season to make way for the arrival of the Winnipeg Jets. The Moose returned to the MTS Centre for the 2015–16 season, making the arena the first (together with the SAP Center at San Jose) to be home to both an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. Only the lower bowl, which has a capacity of 8,812, is used for the majority of Moose home games.

The arena hosted the AHL All-Star Classic on February 1, 2006, in which Team Canada defeated Team PlanetUSA, 9–4.

====National Hockey League====
From 1972 to 1996, the original Winnipeg Jets played home games out of the now-demolished Winnipeg Arena. Facing mounting financial troubles, the franchise relocated to Arizona after the 1995–96 NHL season and became the Phoenix Coyotes.

The idea of Winnipeg one day returning to the NHL gained momentum after the MTS Centre opened. David Thomson and Mark Chipman were floated as potential owners of an NHL team, although many questions were raised about the MTS Centre&#x27;s potential suitability as an NHL venue. The arena&#x27;s capacity was well below that of the next-smallest NHL arena at that time, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, which sat 16,170, but lacked modern design elements. Chipman stated that the arena&#x27;s current size was sufficient for an NHL team due to the unique economics of the local market.

Prior to receiving an NHL team, the MTS Centre hosted several NHL preseason games. The first was held on September 17, 2006, between the Edmonton Oilers and the Phoenix Coyotes (the former Winnipeg Jets) in front of a sold-out crowd, which the Oilers won 5–0. The NHL exhibition game became an annual event for the MTS Centre, concluding in September 2010 when the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, led by captain and Winnipeg-born Jonathan Toews, played the Tampa Bay Lightning in front of a crowd of 14,092.

On May 19, 2011, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that Mark Chipman and True North were finalizing the purchase of the Atlanta Thrashers, with the intent of moving the team to Winnipeg. Chipman and True North had also floated a proposal to return the Coyotes to Winnipeg though this was declined in favor to keeping it in Phoenix. Twelve days later, True North chairman Mark Chipman, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, and Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger held a press conference at the MTS Centre to announce the deal, which was formally approved by the NHL Board of Governors three weeks later. As part of the transition to the NHL, the arena went through some minor renovations to bring it in line with the league&#x27;s standards, including construction of additional press boxes, shuttered lighting, flexible rink glass, and an upgraded ice refrigeration system.

As part of a partnership to subsidize the mortgage of MTS Centre in the wake of the Jets&#x27; return, the province reached a 20-year agreement with True North granting it up to $4 million in gaming revenue per year from designated video lottery terminals downtown. These VLTs would initially be located at the Tavern United sports bar next door to MTS Centre, with the option for True North to construct its own lounge at the nearby Cityplace mall. True North would open a Shark Club sports bar and gaming centre at Cityplace in 2013.

Further improvements were made over the next few years, including concourse improvements, installation of a new HD scoreboard, and the replacement of metal rails with plexiglass to eliminate obstructed views around the arena. A total of 278 premium seats were added to the upper level in 2015, slightly increasing the arena&#x27;s capacity.

Since 2011, the Canada Life Centre has been the smallest permanent arena in the NHL with a capacity of 15,321.

====Western Hockey League====
In May 2023, the Winnipeg Ice of junior hockey&#x27;s Western Hockey League announced that for the WHL Championship Series that month, they would play all home games downtown at the larger Canada Life Centre instead of their usual home, the 1,600-capacity Wayne Fleming Arena. Previously, the Brandon Wheat Kings played select games at the arena due to scheduling conflicts with the Royal Manitoba Winter Fair.

====International====
Canada Life Centre co-hosted the 2007 IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship with Selkirk, which was won by Canada. Other international matches hosted at the arena included 2005 World Junior Championship pretournament games, the fifth game of the 2007 Super Series between Canada and Russia, and the medal round of the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge.

===Curling===
Canada Life Centre hosted the 2008 Tim Hortons Brier. From 2005 through 2010 (barring the 2007–08 edition that was held in Quebec City), the arena hosted the Grand Slam of Curling&#x27;s Canadian Open.

===Combat sports===
On June 15, 2013, the arena hosted UFC 161.

In professional wrestling, it hosted a broadcast of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on February 24, 2020, which was ultimately the final non-hockey event to be held at the arena before the implementation of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; was broadcast from Canada Life Centre on September 30, 2022, as part of WWE&#x27;s first shows in Canada since the beginning of the pandemic.

On March 15, 2023, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) hosted a live broadcast of &quot;Dynamite&quot; and a taping of &quot;Rampage&quot; at Canada Life Centre, in its second-ever Canadian show. Prior to the event, AEW performer Chris Jericho—a long-time resident of Winnipeg—was honoured by Mayor of Winnipeg Scott Gillingham and Premier of Manitoba Heather Stefanson with a portion of Winnipeg’s Wordsworth Way being renamed Chris Jericho Way, and a Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal.

The chapel of St. James was built in 1666 and was a chapel of ease in the Muri parish.

This former farming village showed a steady population decline around 1950. This was followed by a sharp increase since 1970, due to the virtually fog-free area and the short commutes on the train to Zürich and Lucerne. Since 1984, there has been a bus connection to Muri.

Nordic Semiconductor has been ISO 9001 certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) since 1996, and the certificate was upgraded to ISO 9001-2000 in 2001. In 1996, Nordic Semiconductor was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange&#x27;s SME list.

==History==
Nordic Semiconductor was initially founded in 1983 as Nordic VLSI (NVLSI) in Trondheim, Norway by four post-graduates from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Initially, the company focused on the design of mixed-signal application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) within the Nordic region. In 1996, the firm went public on the Norwegian stock exchange, where it still trades . 

In 1998, NVLSI released its first wireless standard products in the 433 MHz ISM band. In 2003 NVLSI was renamed Nordic Semiconductor, often known as Nordic Semi, to reflect the company&#x27;s focus on ultra-low-power wireless devices. The same year saw the release of Nordic Semiconductor&#x27;s first wireless devices at 2.4 GHz. Since 2003, Nordic Semiconductor has maintained a clear focus on wireless products for the 2.4 GHz band and has seen its devices used in a wide range of branded consumer electronic products.

Nordic Semiconductor products support short-range low-power wireless through Bluetooth LE, Thread, Zigbee, and proprietary 2.4 GHz protocols; and low-power cellular IoT through LTE-M and NB-IoT.

2012 saw the release of the third generation of ultra-low-power wireless products. This family of products is named the nRF51 series, and incorporates the ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers at their core.

In 2015 Nordic Semiconductor introduced new 2.4 GHz ISM band SoC series, the nRF52 Series with ARM Cortex-M4 as their core.

In February 2016, the company signed the UN Global Compact.

In January 2018, Nordic Semiconductor introduced its first cellular product, the nRF91 series. With the nRF9160 system in a package (SiP), the company expanded from Bluetooth LE and short-range radio applications into cellular network solutions. The main focus is on cellular IoT by supporting LTE-M and NB-IoT.

In November 2019, Nordic Semiconductor introduced a flagship SoC containing dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 processors and a multi-protocol radio stack (NFC/BLE/BLE mesh/Zigbee/Thread/others), the nRF53 series.

In 2022, Nordic Semiconductor unveiled a low-power, dual-band Wi-Fi 6 companion chip, the nRF70 Series. ICs compatible with the nRF7002 include the nRF52 and nRF53 Bluetooth SoCs and the nRF91 cellular SiP, although Nordic claims that the device can also be used with non-Nordic host devices.

In August 2023, it was announced Nordic Semiconductor had entered into an agreement to acquire the IP portfolio of San Diego-headquartered artificial intelligence and machine learning company, Atlazo.

In October 2023, Nordic Semiconductor announced the second product, nRF54L Series, in its fourth generation of Bluetooth® Low Energy Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) family, the nRF54.

In December 2023, Nordic Semiconductor announced that after 22 years at the helm, Svenn-Tore will step down from the role of CEO. He will be replaced by Vegard Wollan, the co-inventor of the AVR microcontroller architecture. 

In May 2024, the company&#x27;s ESG risk rating was low at just 13.8%. 

==Products==
Nordic Semiconductor designs and produces SoC, SiP, and connectivity solutions for the ISM bands at 5 GHz, 2.4 GHz and 868/915 MHz bands. The products operate on low power, enabling wireless and IoT applications to use little battery and run on harvested energy. 

Current products include SoCs incorporating the ARM Cortex-M0, ARM Cortex-M4 and ARM Cortex-M33 microcontroller cores.

Popular products include the nRF24L01+ and the nRF24LE1, both using the lightweight and proprietary &quot;Enhanced ShockBurst&quot; protocol stack in 2.4 GHz ISM band. The nRF24L01+ is a simple transceiver with some logic to implement the protocol stack and is connected to a microcontroller via an SPI bus, while the nRF24LE1 can be seen as an nRF24L01 and a microcontroller in the same chip.&#x27;

===Cellular IoT ===

<doc id="1084136" wikidata="Q193936" url="?curid=1084136" title="Semyonov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast">
<text>Semyonov () is a town in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, notable for being a major center for traditional handcrafts such as Khokhloma wood painting and matryoshka dolls. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 24,473.

==Geography==
The town is situated in an area of lowland bogs and forests, about northeast of Nizhny Novgorod, the administrative center of the oblast. The Kerzhenets River flows through the town. The surrounding area includes most of the Kerzhenets Nature Reserve, a federal-level strict ecological reserve, established for the protection and scientific study of the local ecology of the region.

==History==
Rachmaninov may have been born there. Poles are buried there because of the Katyn massacre of 1940. Nazi Germany was there from late 1941 to early 1944. 
It was established in the beginning of the 17th century as a settlement of Old Believers. According to an Old Believer legend, the Old Believer settlement in the area was spurred by the existence of the ancient Olenevsky Skete (today, the village of Bolshoye Olenevo, some southeast from Semyonov), which had supposedly been founded in the 15th century by some of Venerable Macarius&#x27;s monks to commemorate their leader&#x27;s Miracle of the Moose that took place at that site, and later joined the &quot;Raskol&quot;.

The first documented mention of Semyonov was in 1644; it was referred to as Semyonov&#x27;s hamlet, later as Semyonovo village, and from 1779 as the uyezd town of Semyonov.

From the beginning of the 19th to the early 20th century, it was a center for Old Believers movement and the only place to produce Old Believers&#x27; religious items such as lestovka prayer beads.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with 1 work settlement and 190 rural localities, incorporated as the town of oblast significance of Semyonov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Semyonov is incorporated as Semyonov Urban Okrug.

==Economy and crafts==
Since 1918 Khokhloma wood painting became a major craft in Semyonov. In 1960, Semyonov was organized as a factory named &quot;Khokhlomskaya rospis&quot; (&quot;&quot;, Russian for &quot;Khokhloma painting&quot;).

This factory specialized in the production of hand-painted wooden items (ranging from tableware to toys and furniture) with unique style, and also matryoshka dolls, marketed as souvenir items. The factory offers tours around the various stages of production and visitors can see craftspeople making and painting the items in traditional Russian styles.

==Transportation==
Semyonov is located on the Nizhny Novgorod-Kotelnich railway, which is part of one of the main routes used by trains traveling from Moscow to the Urals and Siberia. The town is served by electric commuter trains, connecting it to Nizhny Novgorod in just over an hour.

<text>Jared Francis Harris (born 24 August 1961) is a British actor. His roles include Lane Pryce in the drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2009–2012), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series; King George VI in the historical drama series &quot;The Crown&quot; (2016–2017); and Valery Legasov in the miniseries &quot;Chernobyl&quot; (2019), for which he won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie&quot;.&quot; 

Harris also had roles as David Robert Jones in the science fiction series &quot;Fringe&quot; (2008–2012), Anderson Dawes in the science fiction series &quot;The Expanse&quot; (2015–2017) and Captain Francis Crozier in the series &quot;The Terror&quot; (2018). He is also known for his significant supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008), &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; (2011), and Hari Seldon, a leading character in the science fiction series &quot;Foundation&quot; (2021).

== Early life ==
Harris was born on 24 August 1961 in Hammersmith, London, the second of three sons of Irish actor Richard Harris and his first wife, Welsh actress Elizabeth Rees-Williams (1936–2022). His younger brother is actor Jamie Harris, his older brother is director Damian Harris and his maternal grandfather was politician David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore.

==Education==
Harris was educated at Ladycross School, a former preparatory boarding independent school in the coastal town of Seaford in East Sussex, as were his brothers Jamie and Damian. He says, &quot;They were famous for discipline, with cold showers every morning&quot;, and that &quot;You were never known by your first name there. You were either called by your number, or your last name. Since there were three of us, Damian was &#x27;Harris Ma&#x27; for major. I was &#x27;Harris Mi&#x27; for minor, and Jamie was &#x27;Harris Minimus,&#x27; being the youngest and the smallest&quot;. He then attended Downside School, a Catholic boarding independent school in the village of Stratton-on-the-Fosse (near the market town of Shepton Mallet) in Somerset, in South West England. He went on to Duke University in the U.S., graduating in 1984 with a BFA in drama, then returned to England to train as an actor at the Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 1989.

== Career ==
=== 1983–2008 ===

Harris began his film career directing &quot;Darkmoor&quot; (1983), an unfinished feature-length film for Duke University&#x27;s Freewater Films. His first film appearance as an actor was in &quot;The Rachel Papers&quot; (1989). He took minor roles in films such as the western romance &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992), the historical epic &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1992), and the crime drama &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994). He took the role of Benmont Tench in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995). He portrayed the role of the aged Will Robinson in the 1998 movie adaptation of the television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. That same year he portrayed Vladimir in the controversial black comedy drama film &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), written and directed by Todd Solondz. He portrayed Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s character&#x27;s doppelgänger in &quot;How to Kill Your Neighbor&#x27;s Dog&quot; (2000).

Other notable roles include Andy Warhol in &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, John Lennon in the television movie &quot;Two of Us&quot; (2000) and King Henry VIII in the 2003 BBC film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;. Harris portrayed Dr. Charles Ashford in &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; (2004). He portrayed the gruff Captain Anderson in the BBC2 adaptation of &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot;; Mac McGrath in the movie &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot;; Eamon Quinn on the FX series &quot;The Riches&quot;; and David Robert Jones on &quot;Fringe&quot;.

=== 2009–2017 ===
He gained widespread fame for his portrayal of Lane Pryce in the AMC period drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot; from 2009 until 2012. The show focuses on the lives of Ad Men in New York City during the 1960s. He first appeared in season three where he arrives as a British newcomer to Sterling Cooper, and later becomes a partner of the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Paul MacInnes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of Lane Pryce, &quot;For much of his three season tenure on the show, Lane has seemed like the archetypal Englishman...He was polite, courteous, dry-witted, stingy. He was also apparently logical and keenly stoic, keeping calm and carrying on when Sterling Cooper broke up and its successor nearly went under.&quot; Harris received critical acclaim for his final appearance in the episode &quot;Commissions and Fees&quot; as well as a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, losing to Aaron Paul for &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; in 2012. He returned to the series to direct the 11th episode of season 7, which aired in 2015. 

He portrayed Ulysses S. Grant in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s acclaimed historical drama film &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012). 

His portrayal of King George VI in the first season of &quot;The Crown&quot; received praise from critic Matt Zoller Seitz, who stated that despite the series&#x27; large ensemble, &quot;Harris still manages to communicate the character’s understated sensitivity and awareness of his circumscribed role in England’s drama so poignantly that one can’t help being moved by the performance&quot;. He received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series.

=== 2018–present ===
He portrayed Captain Francis Crozier in the 2018 series &quot;The Terror&quot;, based on the Dan Simmons novel of the same name that provided a fictional account of the fate of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition. In November 2018, Harris was one of the first recipients of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society&#x27;s Louie Kamookak Medal, awarded &quot;for making Canada&#x27;s geography better known to Canadians and to the world&quot;, for his portrayal of Captain Crozier. Harris said that he was &quot;gratified&quot; that the series inspired curiosity about the real expedition, remarking, &quot;It’s sort of fitting that history will recall that it was the RCGS that first recognized &quot;The Terror&quot;, and that we as the recipients walked in the footsteps of Louie Kamookak.&quot;

In 2019, Harris portrayed Valery Legasov in the acclaimed miniseries &quot;Chernobyl&quot;, which revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed. For that role he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. The series was produced by HBO in the United States and Sky UK in the United Kingdom.

In March 2019, Harris joined Jared Leto in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man spinoff &quot;Morbius&quot;. He plays the developer of psychohistory Hari Seldon in the &quot;Foundation&quot; television series produced for Apple TV+ which premiered in September 2021. In March 2021, Harris was announced to have joined the cast of the biographical drama film &quot;Rothko&quot;, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson.

In 2024, he played the father of a returning missing child in the British psychological thriller film &quot;Reawakening&quot;, alongside Erin Doherty and Juliet Stevenson.

==Personal life==
Harris married Jacqueline Goldenberg in 1989 and they divorced three years later.

Harris married actress Emilia Fox, the daughter of actors Edward Fox and Joanna David, on 16 July 2005. Divorce filings were made in January 2009; the divorce was finalised in June 2010.

In April 2009, Harris met Allegra Riggio, a lighting designer and television host, at a comedy club where a mutual friend was performing. They married on 9 November 2013.

Harris resides in Los Angeles.

<text>Harinder Jeet Singh Takhar (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Mississauga Centre and Mississauga—Erindale. He served in the cabinets of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne.

==Background==
Takhar was born to a Sikh family in the Indian state of Punjab, with a background in farming and civil service work. He moved to Canada in 1974, and arrived in Mississauga, Ontario in 1977. He obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and a master&#x27;s degree in economics and political science and recently added Kellogg Schlich&#x27;s EMBA degree to his FCPA and FCMA designations. 
He has been certified as a CMA. He has taught CMA and CGA-accredited courses at Sheridan College for thirteen years. Takhar held senior financial positions with AGRA Industries Limited, Linear Technology Inc./Gennum Corporation, and Timex Canada Inc. He also served as an Associate Director and Chief Financial Officer of Peel Dtsricy School Board from 1994 to 2003. In addition, he also served as the president and chief executive officer of the Chalmers Group of Companies until his election to the Ontario legislature.

Takhar received the 2001 Community Service Award from the Society of Management Accountants of Ontario for &quot;demonstrating selflessness and kindness for the benefit of society.&quot; He lives with his wife Balwinder and their two daughters in Mississauga.

==Politics==
Takhar ran in the 2003 provincial election as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Mississauga Centre. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Rob Sampson by 2,620 votes. He ran again in 2007 in the redistributed riding of Mississauga—Erindale defeating PC candidate David Brown by 6,638 votes. He was re-elected in 2011. While it was initially reported that he intended to retire, he changed his mind about running and was re-elected in June 2014.

He was appointed Minister of Transportation on October 23, 2003, by Premier Dalton McGuinty. He is the first Indian-Canadian to hold a cabinet post in Ontario. In October 2007 he was appointed as a Minister of Small Business and Entrepreneurship.

He resigned from Cabinet in 2012 to stand as a candidate in the 2013 Liberal leadership convention to choose McGuinty&#x27;s successor. Takhar ran a very focused campaign, put forward very innovative policies, and surprised everyone with the number of delegates he could secure to support his leadership bid. After the first round, he withdrew to endorse Sandra Pupatello, who went on to lose to Kathleen Wynne.

On February 11, 2013, Wynne reappointed Takhar to Minister of Government Services. Also, it made him the Management Board Chair. On May 8, 2013, he resigned from Cabinet after being hospitalized after he lost his mother .

He remained in the legislature as MPP until he decided not to seek reelection in June 2018. He currently serves as the Chairman/CEO of Chalmers Group of Companies based in Mississauga. He previously served as the Chairman of United Way of Peel and Chair of the Board of Credit Valley Hospital. He was also the founding member and president of the International Punjabi Chamber of Commerce. Takhar frequently appears on radio programs to express his views regarding political and economic issues and is a highly respected member of the South Asian community.

As a National Government it contained members of the Conservative Party, Liberal Nationals and National Labour, as well as a number of individuals who belonged to no political party. The Government oversaw the Edward VIII abdication crisis and three monarchs in 1936. In May 1937, Baldwin resigned and was replaced as prime minister by Neville Chamberlain.

<doc id="1084166" wikidata="Q1725152" url="?curid=1084166" title="The Congos">
<text>The Congos are a reggae vocal group from Jamaica which formed as the duo &quot;Ashanti&quot; Roy Johnson (tenor) (b. Roydel Johnson, 1947, Hanover, Jamaica) and Cedric Myton (falsetto) (b. 1947, Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica), later becoming a trio with the addition of Watty Burnett (baritone) (b. early 1950s, Port Antonio, Jamaica), and have been active on and off from the mid-1970s until the present day. They are best known for their &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; album, recorded with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.

==History==
Myton had previously been a member of The Tartans in the late 1960s (along with Prince Lincoln Thompson, Devon Russell and Lindburgh Lewis), and Ras Michael&#x27;s group, and had recorded with Thompson&#x27;s Royal Rasses in the mid-1970s. He formed the Congos, initially as a duo with Johnson, recording the single &quot;At the Feast&quot; for Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. Perry expanded the group to a trio with the addition of Burnett, this line-up recording the classic roots reggae album &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; in 1977 at Perry&#x27;s Black Ark studio. The album featured illustrious backing singers such as Gregory Isaacs, The Meditations, and Barry LLewellyn and Earl Morgan of The Heptones. The album has been described as &quot;the most consistently brilliant album of Scratch&#x27;s entire career&quot;.

Perry&#x27;s previous productions by Max Romeo and Junior Murvin had been huge commercial successes thanks to a deal with Island Records, but Perry was in dispute with Island at the time the Congos&#x27; album was finished, so it was released on his own Black Ark label, limiting its success overseas, and causing a rift with the group. The Congos went their own way, organising a limited pressing of the album themselves. United Kingdom label Go Feet eventually reissued the album in 1980, and although the group had recorded new material since leaving Perry, &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; proved a hard act to follow and their other releases suffered as a consequence. Albums such as &quot;Congo Ashanti&quot; were sparser and sounded ordinary compared to Perry&#x27;s kitchen-sink-and-all massive productions. 

Burnett quit the group, soon followed by Johnson, who embarked on a solo career. Myton continued to record as The Congos with various other musicians until the mid-1980s.

In the mid-1990s, The Congos reformed, with Myton and Burnett joined by Lindburgh Lewis, several albums following in subsequent years. In 2005 Myton recorded &quot;Give Them the Rights&quot; with a host of backup singers and star session players such as Sly and Robbie and Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith, very much in the spiritual 70s roots vein.
In 2006, the UK reggae revival label Blood and Fire released the album &quot;Fisherman Style&quot; featuring a remixed version of the classic cut &quot;Fisherman&quot; from &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; plus such legends as Horace Andy, Big Youth, Dillinger, Prince Jazzbo, Luciano, Freddie McGregor, Gregory Isaacs, Max Romeo, Mykal Rose, Dean Fraser, Sugar Minott, and U-Roy doing their own new versions over the original rhythm.

In 2002, they appeared on the album &quot;The Slackers and Friends&quot; by the ska/reggae band The Slackers.

In 2008, The Congos appeared in the independent feature film, &quot;Wah Do Dem&quot; which captures them performing &quot;Fisherman,&quot; and &quot;Congoman Chant,&quot; under a full moon at Helshire Beach outside Kingston. 

In 2009, Myton, Burnett, and Johnson reunited with Perry to record the album &quot;Back in the Black Ark&quot;, which, despite its title, was recorded at Myton&#x27;s studio in Portmore and at Mixing Lab, Kingston.

Levi has mentioned he is a great Otis Redding fan. They were cut in a typical mod R&amp;B soul style. His second single was for Deram 226, released 17 January 1969, and featured &quot;Meadow of My Love&quot; c/w &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;. The B-side was self-written, being credited to &#x27;Sutherland&#x27;. He recorded &quot;Fire Fire&quot; c/w &quot;Jesus Keepeth My Soul&quot; as The Youth on Pama in 1971. His next three singles were &quot;I&#x27;m a Levi&quot; and &quot;Jah Heavy Load&quot; on Concrete Jungle followed by &quot;Chariot of Love&quot; on Organisation, all produced by Dennis Harris, in 1976, before signing to Island Records. In 1985 Levi released &quot;I Do&quot;, a duet he recorded with his second wife, Madge. The song performed well on the British reggae charts, reaching top position.

<doc id="1084196" wikidata="Q6661124" url="?curid=1084196" title="Llancillo Church">
<text>Llancillo Church (also spelled Llancilo) is a Grade II*-listed redundant church in Herefordshire, England, near the Welsh border at .

Situated amongst trees and fields, it was dedicated to Saint Peter and alternatively to St Tysilio. The church was built in the 11th century and has been revised and restored since, including a Victorian restoration in the 1890s.

It contains a font from the 13th century and 17th century pulpit. One of the bells is believed to have been cast in the 13th century or earlier.

==History==

It is thought that the remote site was first used by a hermit in the 6th century but that the current chancel dates from the 11th century and the rest of the church was substantially rebuilt in the 17th century. It underwent Victorian restoration in the 1890s.

Despite being situated in Herefordshire, on the English side of the border, the church lay within the Welsh Diocese of St David&#x27;s until 1852 when it was transferred to the Diocese of Hereford.

On 22 December 2006, the building was closed for regular public worship and, in 2007, passed to the Friends of Friendless Churches to maintain and restore. Whilst Llancillo remains a civil parish, it now falls within the Church of England parish of Rowlestone and Llancillo.

==Architecture==

The sandstone building has a slate roof, and tufa dressings. It consists of a chancel and nave which is and has a porch on the south side. One of the bells in the bellcote was cast possibly in the 13th century or earlier.

There is a Tudor doorway and, inside, a 13th-century baptismal font. The oak pulpit is from 1632.

In the churchyard are the remains of a 14th century preaching cross with an octagonal base. Nearby is mound which is the site of a motte castle.

The church lies on the Walterstone ley line described by Alfred Watkins in his book, The Old Straight Track.

<text>The Communist Party of Sweden () is a Marxist–Leninist communist party in Sweden and continuation of Workers&#x27; Party – The Communists (, APK).

== History ==
The Flamman group, an orthodox pro-Soviet section within Left Party – The Communists (&quot;Vänsterpartiet Kommunisterna&quot;), emerged as an internal fraction when C.-H. Hermansson took over as party leader and distanced the party from Moscow. The group was centered on the party newspaper &quot;Norrskensflamman&quot; (&#x27;The Flame of the Aurora Borealis&#x27;; usually just called &quot;Flamman&quot;), the regional party publication in Norrbotten County. The fraction worked as a parallel party centre, and relations between it and the party leadership soured.

At the party congress in 1975, when Hermansson stepped down as party leader, the &quot;Flamman&quot; group launched Rolf Hagel as its candidate for the party leadership. Hagel was defeated by Lars Werner with 162 votes against 74. In the same year the &quot;Flamman&quot;-sympathizers were expelled from &quot;Kommunistisk Ungdom&quot; (&quot;Communist Youth&quot;), the youth league of the party.

The group broke away in 1977, and formed Arbetarpartiet Kommunisterna (&#x27;Workers Party – the Communists&#x27;, abbreviated APK). A founding congress took place in the Swedish Riksdag. A large number of foreign delegates attended the congress, indicating that APK had strong moral support from CPSU and the orthodox sector of the World Communist Movement. Two MPs (and party central committee members), Rolf Hagel and Alf Löwenborg, led the split. Hagel was elected party president. &quot;Norrskensflamman&quot; became the central party organ.

Entire VPK party units joined APK in many places, including Malmö, Gothenburg and Mälardalen. The foremost stronghold of the new party was Norrbotten County. In total, up to 25% of the entire VPK party membership (other sources claim between 10% and 15%) joined APK. To a large extent it was the trade union cadres of VPK who joined APK. Shortly thereafter, a large section of the KU district in Gävleborg County joined APK.

&quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomsförbund&quot; (&#x27;Young Communist League of Sweden&#x27;, abbreviated SKU) was created as the youth league of the party. A student wing, &quot;Marxistiska Studenter&quot; (&#x27;Marxist Students&#x27;), was founded although it never attained any importance.

APK failed to make any electoral breakthrough, and gradually the party declined. The fall of the Soviet Union had a very negative impact on the party; many members left, either to leave politics completely or to rejoin the Left Party. SKU broke away in 1990, and had a short-lived period as an independent communist youth organization.

In 1995, APK was declared financially bankrupt by state authorities, the first political party in Sweden to suffer that fate.

Directly after the bankruptcy of APK, the core around Hagel regrouped and reconstituted their party as Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (Communist Party of Sweden). In 2000 SKU was reorganized as the party youth league.

<text>RAF Daws Hill was a Ministry of Defence site, located near High Wycombe and Flackwell Heath, in Buckinghamshire, England, close to the M40 motorway.

The station was established in 1942 on land owned by Wycombe Abbey School, for use by the United States military. Initially used by the United States Army Air Forces, RAF Daws Hill was used in its later years by the United States Navy. It became an important part of US defence in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, housing a nuclear bunker with a control centre for the direction of nuclear bombers and cruise missiles. As a result of this and the wider presence of US nuclear weapons on British soil during the 1980s and 1990s, the site became home to a peace camp between 1982 and 1985.

Following a review of Ministry of Defence properties in the south-east of England, the station closed in 2007 and the site was sold to a property developer in 2011. The station&#x27;s nuclear bunker received Grade II* listed status from English Heritage in October 2013, and much of the remaining site was cleared for redevelopment as housing during 2015.

==History==
===Establishment===
American military forces were first stationed at High Wycombe in 1942, shortly after the United States&#x27; formal entrance into the Second World War. So urgent was the action that Wycombe Abbey School, situated on the land that would become the station, was given three weeks to find new facilities; failure in this effort led to the school&#x27;s closing, until the independent girls&#x27; school was returned by the US in 1945. An underground bunker, which later became a nuclear-reinforced bunker was built within the grounds of the school and was codenamed &quot;Pinetree&quot;.

The VIII Bomber Command Headquarters was at RAF Daws Hill and known as USAAF Station 1101.

In 1952, the station, formerly known as Daws Hill House, welcomed US forces again. From 1952 to 1965 the station appears to have housed a command bunker for the 7th Air Division, the UK-based elements of Strategic Air Command. The following years of the Cold War saw fluctuation in the station&#x27;s importance.

Approximately 800 personnel were stationed there when, in 1969, their numbers were reduced, so that, in the early 1970s, only a small group remained for upkeep of facilities.

Then, in 1975, activity escalated, revitalising the station&#x27;s importance to the American military in Europe. Its nuclear bunker, with 23,000 square feet (2,100 square meters) of space, housed high-tech equipment for the direction of nuclear bombers and guided missiles.

Between 1982 and 1985 there was a peace camp outside the base protesting against the bringing of United States cruise missiles to the United Kingdom.

Use of the station was reduced with the end of the Cold War; by 1992, US Defense personnel at RAF Daws Hill numbered fewer than 350.

===Closure and redevelopment===
In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence proposed to close RAF Daws Hill some years in the future, turning the of land over to other public and private use and relocating American Naval personnel and activities to other locations near London, particularly RAF Uxbridge. The plan apparently fizzled, however, when the US Navy voiced its preference to remain. High Wycombe, desiring to build at least 400 new houses by 2011 for its growing population, considered the land ideal for up to 600 houses; but nearby residents also rejected the proposal because of the changes that it would entail, including increased traffic on relatively quiet roads.

During 2007 the US Navy staged a withdrawal from the greater London area, leading to the facilities at RAF Daws Hill becoming surplus to operational requirements. Station facilities including the shops, workshops and petrol station closed in August 2007, followed by the remainder of the station later that year.

In June 2011, the site was placed up for sale by the Ministry of Defence. Taylor Wimpey subsequently bought the site, planning to build a housing estate of around 500 homes. Some personnel and their families remained on the site, occupying the housing while alternative accommodation was found. The Ministry of Defence continued to rent the 67 bungalows from Taylor Wimpey until September 2011. Local residents formed the Daws Hill Residents&#x27; Association in light of the proposals for redeveloping the site, following concerns over the impact it could have on the area.

In March 2012, the Ministry of Defence sought permission from Wycombe District Council for the demolition of the station&#x27;s Cold War bunker by the summer. However, in September 2014 it received Grade II* protected status listing from English Heritage. By January 2015 demolition of the bungalows was underway and by February 2017, 50 homes had been completed out of a projected 444. As of March 2022, all 444 homes are complete. The estate is called Pine Trees and roads have been given names such as Kennedy Avenue, Arizona Way and Eisenhower Lower Close to reflect US Forces having been previously based there.

==London Central Elementary High School==
The station was home, between 1971 and 2007, to London Central Elementary High School, part of the Department of Defense Dependents Schools, with pupils in grades K–12. Also at Daws Hill were 70 housing units for American personnel and their families. Other facilities include warehouses and those for vehicle maintenance, as well as support buildings for persons who lived and worked at the station, such as a bank, a post office, a bowling alley, sports grounds and buildings, a small exchange, an automobile refuelling station, and a social club.

The school&#x27;s final class graduated in 2007 when the school closed.

<doc id="1084213" wikidata="Q3270937" url="?curid=1084213" title="Beverage-can stove">
<text>A beverage-can stove, or pop-can stove, is a do it yourself, ultralight, alcohol-burning portable stove. It is made using parts from two aluminium beverage cans. Basic designs can be relatively simple, but many variations exist.

Total weight, including a windscreen/stand, can be less than . The design is popular in ultralight backpacking due to its low cost and lighter weight than commercial stoves. This advantage may be lost on long hiking trips, where a lot of fuel is packed, since alcohol has less energy per gram than some other stove fuels.

Of the available fuels, methanol delivers the least energy, isopropyl alcohol delivers more, butanol is hardly ever used, and pure ethanol the most. Denatured alcohol and rubbing alcohol are frequently used for this purpose, as it often contains a mixture of ethanol and other alcohols. All but isopropyl alcohol burn with a smokeless flame; it can provide both light and heat.

==History and design==
The basic design dates back more than a century. It consists of a double-wall gas generator, a perforated burner ring, and an inner preheat chamber. A similar design was patented in 1904 by New York coppersmith J. Heinrichs. Trangia has been selling a commercial version of the design since 1925, and Safesport marketed a stainless-steel stove in the 1990s. The Trangia stove burner is made from brass, although all the other associated parts that come with it are aluminium.

In the unpressurized open-top design the double wall acts as a gas generator, transferring heat from the flame to the fuel. This effect enhances combustion, producing more heat than other passive designs. The inner wall also creates a convenient preheat chamber for starting the stove. Once the fuel has warmed up, its vapor will travel up the hollow wall, pass through the perforations, and form a ring of flame. This improves air/fuel mixing and therefore combustion. Vapor also rises from the center of the stove and burns when passing through the ring of flame as long as a pot is over the stove. 

Pressurized designs have no cut-out in the top. They are filled with alcohol by separating the two halves of the burner, by opening a plug to a smaller hole in the center of the top side or by filling through the gas-jet holes.

A wick may be inserted into the hollow wall, where it will draw fuel upwards closer to the hot parts of the burner. Evaporating fuel from the wick removes heat from the top parts of the burner and subsequently the fuel at the bottom receives less heat. This slows down evaporation through the center while increasing the gas pressure inside the wall, spreading the ring of flame outwards, inwards, or vertically depending on the jet directions, while the center of the burner produces almost no flame, leading to a more controlled burn and faster starting. Suitable wick materials include fiberglass or cotton cloth. The wick will not burn because the evaporating fuel keeps it cool; also the pressure inside prevents oxygen from entering the hollow until the burner can no longer produce enough gas to support a flame. Cellulose cigarette filters wick fuel efficiently upwards but melt and burn in all but the least powerful designs. Other wick materials in use are Kevlar and other aramid fibers, carbon felt, fiberglass, and even toilet paper.

==Aluminium-can construction==

The stove is made from two aluminium can bottoms. An inner wall is cut and rolled from the can material. A ring of holes is pierced into the top with a pin. Parts can be glued with silicone sealant, high-temperature epoxy, or sealed with aluminum (thermal) foil tape, although this is not necessary. Total height is less than two inches (50 mm), though dimensions may be increased to hold more fuel or decreased to take up even less space.

The choice of aluminium has several advantages—light weight, low cost, and good thermal conductivity to aid vaporization of fuel. Modifications to the surface such as inking or painting a dark color increase the amount of radiant thermal energy captured by the stove body and change the stove&#x27;s burn profile as a function of time, fuel load, and ambient temperature. Many designs require priming to get started and most are regenerative and stable during operation. Alternative construction materials have been used, including stoves made of tin cans such as cat food tins, tuna cans, and juice cans — the basic design is very similar. Windscreens/stands can be fabricated from tin cans, cut to size with ventilation holes added. Steel beverage cans of the classic design are still in limited use and while they are heat resistant, their coating will burn off and they will rust if not cared for.

==Operation and performance==
Each stove works well to supply one or two people. When used to cook larger meals (greater than 2 cups (0.5 litres)), it is less efficient than a more-powerful stove which delivers more heat to a pot. This is because a longer time is required to reach the boiling temperature, during which more heat is lost to the surroundings.

To use the stove, a small amount of fuel is poured into the stove and ignited. The pot is then placed above the stove, on a windscreen or stand. The flame is small at first, only burning from the inner chamber. Once the fuel has warmed up (requiring about one minute) its vapor will pass through the perforations and form a ring of flame. Enough heat from the flame is passed to the fuel to maintain full combustion until the fuel runs out.

===Ratings===
* Time to boil 2 cups (500 mL): ~4–12 minutes (45 mL of fuel)
* Time to boil 4 cups (1 L): ~10–24 minutes (90 mL of fuel)
* Burn time: ~10–20 minutes (60 mL/4 tablespoons of fuel)

Boil times can be significantly reduced by using a pot of the appropriate diameter (to reduce heat loss on the sides of the pot) and especially by a wind screen which maximizes efficiency.

* Time to boil 2 cups (500 mL): ~5 minutes at 6500 ft (2000m) altitude with ambient temp of ~45F (7C) and water temp of ~55F (13C).

===Comparison with other stoves===
The stove can outperform some commercial models in cold or high-altitude environments, where propane and butane canisters might fail. Roland Mueser, in &quot;Long-Distance Hiking&quot;, surveyed hikers on the Appalachian Trail and found that this stove was the only design with a zero-percent failure rate.

Fuel usage (by weight) is about fifty percent greater than a butane/propane stove. Can stoves weigh less than , compared with for the lightest gas stoves. Many commercial stoves also require special fuel canisters, adding to overall stove weight. No such canisters are necessary in a can stove; denatured alcohol can be carried in virtually any lightweight container, such as a plastic soda bottle. The weight advantage of the beverage-can stove is diminished by the greater fuel consumption (especially on longer hikes), but may still be offset by its reliability and simplicity.

Other attributes of the beverage-can stove are its nearly silent operation and its suitability as an emergency backup.
* Denatured alcohol is a (relatively) environmentally-friendly fuel that does not leave a residue or soot. Denatured alcohol is commonly available at camping outfitters and hardware stores. Denatured alcohol is toxic to drink.
* Non-toxic pure ethanol is rarely used as stove fuel in the United States, since it is usually subject to a liquor tax. However it also has some medicinal use in treating stings and bites, as a coolant, and antiseptic. 
* These stoves operate marginally on 90% isopropyl alcohol, poorly on 70% and not at all with 50%. Water typically cannot be boiled with isopropyl rubbing alcohol, but if the more rarely found (still inexpensive) laboratory grade or &quot;gas drier&quot; is used, and the sooting is dealt with by applying a little soap solution to the pot, the fuel value of the alcohol will reduce boiling times, not increase them.

==Variations==


; Standard : The classic ultra-lightweight backpacking stove. Designed for one person, lighter than commercial models of the same design
; Inverted two-piece : Smaller and lighter than the standard version; difficult to fill
; Side-burner : Doubles as its own pot stand (holes are in the side). A tight-fitting pot can increase fuel pressure
; Pressurized : A more powerful version. A hole in the top of the stove is sealed with a thumbscrew after filling with fuel; this allows the stove to control the rate of heat output. An additional base is used to hold fuel for preheating
; Back-pressured : Back-pressured stoves simplify the pressurized design by eliminating the thumbscrew and the base needed for preheating, while still controlling the rate of energy output
; Insulated : A variation on the standard design, with an inner wall and insulated with fiberglass
; Other : Numerous designs in use
; Multiple-unit : More than one unit can be used under the same pot when cooking for a larger number of people

==Safety issues==
Alcohol stoves are inherently dangerous, since spilling is possible and the fuel burns with a nearly invisible flame. If a spill occurs the best course of action often is to step back and let the alcohol burn up. 

A stove with a deep well is wind and blow-out resistant — blowing into it can send burning alcohol flying. A stove with a small, shallow well, or a central wick may or may not be blown out to stop it from burning. A safe and lightweight snuff cap or simmer ring is added to some stove designs. Yet alcohol remains safer than most camping fuels. An alcohol fire can be extinguished with plain water, and alcohol fumes are mostly non-explosive.

Fuel must never be added when the flame is still burning. 
The Trangia fuel bottles do not automatically shut off, nor do they prevent flashback. While the valve does close if released, human reflex is not fast enough to release the valve if flashback occurs.

The Boy Scouts of America prohibits &quot;equipment that is handcrafted... due to legal concerns. Examples include alcohol-burning &#x27;can&#x27; stoves...&quot; The nearly invisible flame and the risk of spilling burning fuel can cause burns.

<text>Colonel John Hewson, also spelt Hughson (died 1662), was a shoemaker from London and religious Independent who fought for Parliament and the Commonwealth in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, reaching the rank of colonel. Considered one of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s most reliable supporters within the New Model Army, his unit played a prominent part in Pride&#x27;s Purge of December 1648. Hewson signed the death warrant for the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, for which he reportedly sourced the headsman, while soldiers from his regiment provided security. 

During the 1649 to 1660 Interregnum, he served as Governor of Dublin and MP for County Dublin until 1656. He then returned to England and was MP for Guildford before being elevated to Cromwell&#x27;s Other House in 1658. As one of the surviving Regicides of Charles I, he was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act after the 1660 Stuart Restoration. He went into exile in the Dutch Republic, and is thought to have died in Amsterdam in 1662.

==Personal details==
Very little is known of Hewson&#x27;s life prior to 1642, other than that he worked as a shoemaker in Westminster during the late 1620s and 1630s. In February 1628, he is recorded as having sold eight pairs of shoes to the Massachusetts Bay Company; this suggests he was born prior to 1604, since doing so required him to be a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, and at least 24 years old.

Hewson himself later testified he had lived as a &quot;child of wrath&quot; in a &quot;wicked and profane family&quot; in London, before being converted through the influence of a godly preacher. He was later accused of being an Anabaptist, a sect viewed as radical revolutionaries, and in consequence persecuted by Catholics and mainstream Protestants alike. 

Hewson was married twice; his first wife died in Dublin in January 1652, and he quickly remarried. The names of his partners, and whether either marriage produced children, are unknown, although one source claims he had three unrecorded &quot;Anabaptist&quot; sons. 

==First English Civil War==
Prior to the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642, Hewson probably served in the Westminster Trained Bands, which fought at Turnham Green. He subsequently joined the Parliamentarian field army, and is thought to be the &quot;John Huson&quot; listed in November 1642 as a captain in the Earl of Essex Regiment. At some point in 1643, he transferred to the army of the Eastern Association, commanded by the Earl of Manchester, and in March 1644 was appointed Lieutenant colonel of a new infantry regiment raised by John Pickering. This unit fought at Marston Moor in July, then Second Newbury in October. 
Pickering&#x27;s Regiment was incorporated into the New Model Army in April 1645 as one of its twelve authorised infantry formations, with Hewson as Lieutenant Colonel. Like Hewson, Pickering was a religious Independent with strong Anabaptist sympathies, while other officers included Major John Jubbes, a Leveller who resigned his commission in 1647, and Daniel Axtell, a Baptist and future regicide. Their appointments had to be approved by Parliament, whose moderate Presbyterian majority viewed the growth of religious and political radicalism in the army with considerable unease. The House of Lords originally replaced Pickering and all of his company commanders, including Hewson, with officers from another regiment, before pressure from the House of Commons led them to approve the original list by one vote. 

Seen as particularly close to Oliver Cromwell, in June 1645 Pickering&#x27;s was described as one of the &#x27;chiefest praying and preaching regiments in the army&#x27;. Hewson fought at Naseby in June 1645, then took part in the offensive against Royalist strongholds in South West England, including Sherborne Castle, Lacock Abbey, Bridgwater, Bristol and Basing House. While besieging Exeter in November, Pickering died at Ottery St Mary and was replaced by Hewson as colonel, with Axtell as his deputy. The regiment then joined the forces besieging the Royalist wartime capital of Oxford, whose surrender in June 1646 brought the First Civil War to an end. While stationed in the area, Hewson confirmed his reputation as a religious radical by illegally preaching in a local church, having first denounced its minister as an agent of the Antichrist.

==Second English Civil War and Cromwellian Conquest of Ireland==

Despite victory in the First Civil War, the period that followed saw increasing conflict between the moderate majority in Parliament, and more radical elements within the New Model Army. By early 1647, its soldiers were owed more than £300,000 in wages, an enormous sum for the period, while Parliament was struggling with a shattered economy, an outbreak of the bubonic plague, and the refusal of Charles I to agree a peace settlement. Hewson acted as one of the army&#x27;s representatives in negotiations with Parliament over their arrears, and in November 1647 Sir Thomas Fairfax ordered his regiment into London to seize money for paying the troops. 

When the Second English Civil War began in April 1648, Hewson helped suppress the rebellion in Kent, including the storming of Maidstone, where he was commended for his bravery. The renewed fighting convinced Cromwell and others that Charles must be removed, and Hewson played a prominent part in bringing this about. His regiment supported Pride&#x27;s Purge of December 1648, where MPs who opposed putting the king on trial were forcibly excluded or arrested. In January 1649, he served on the court that approved the Execution of Charles I, signed the death warrant and reportedly sourced the headsman, while soldiers from his regiment under Daniel Axtell provided security during the trial and execution.

Despite his religious radicalism, Hewson was an authoritarian in matters of army discipline. When 300 men from his regiment refused in May 1649 to serve in the proposed Cromwellian Conquest of Ireland, they were swiftly dismissed, after which Hewson helped Cromwell crush the Banbury mutiny. In late August, he arrived in Ireland as part of Cromwell&#x27;s expeditionary force and was present at the Siege of Drogheda, where he allegedly set fire to a church containing nearly 100 Irish and English Royalist refugees. Shortly afterwards, Hewson replaced Michael Jones as Governor of Dublin, then participated in the relief of Arklow and the Siege of Kilkenny in March 1650, where he lost an eye.

==The Interregnum and death==

After the capture of Clonmel in May 1650, Cromwell returned to England, leaving Henry Ireton in charge of reducing the remaining pockets of organised Irish resistance. Hewson continued as Governor of Dublin, and joined the Gathered church founded there by John Rogers, a leading Fifth Monarchist preacher, putting him at odds with the majority of the Dublin Castle administration, who were either Presbyterians or members of the mainstream Protestant Church of Ireland. Recalled to London for consultations in 1652, he was nominated MP for Ireland in the 1653 Barebones Parliament; unlike many of his army colleagues, he supported its dissolution, and backed Cromwell&#x27;s appointment as Lord Protector, albeit allegedly with great reluctance. 

Returning to Ireland, Hewson was elected MP for County Dublin in the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654, but later fell out with Henry Cromwell, the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Ordered back to England in 1656, he represented Guildford in the Second Protectorate Parliament, in which role he opposed Parliamentary moves to offer Cromwell the crown. In 1658, he was created Lord Hewson and took his place in Cromwell&#x27;s Other House, a body equivalent to the House of Lords abolished in 1649. The Puritan Earl of Warwick reportedly refused to attend the House in protest at the elevation of a man with Hewson&#x27;s low social origins.

Cromwell died in September 1658 and was succeeded as Lord Protector by his eldest son Richard. He proved incapable of controlling the competing factions within the New Model and Parliament, and resigned in May 1659, bringing the Protectorate to an end. The Rump Parliament dismissed in 1653 was reseated, and Hewson was appointed commander of the infantry in Ireland, but was back in London in October as a member of the Committee of Safety, set up by the army to assert its authority over Parliament. In December, the Council ordered Hewson to suppress demonstrations in London demanding a free Parliament, during which several people were killed. This destroyed their authority, and Hewson was cashiered, although he escaped further punishment. 

By April 1660, the Stuart Restoration was imminent which meant regicides like Hewson were liable to arrest and execution; he escaped to Amsterdam in May, where he is thought to have died in 1662. However, this is not known for certain, while other sources claim he died in Rouen in 1663.

<text>A compound steam engine unit is a type of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more stages.
A typical arrangement for a compound engine is that the steam is first expanded in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder, then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts directly into one or more larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinders. Multiple-expansion engines employ additional cylinders, of progressively lower pressure, to extract further energy from the steam.

Invented in 1781, this technique was first employed on a Cornish beam engine in 1804. Around 1850, compound engines were first introduced into Lancashire textile mills.

==Compound systems==
There are many compound systems and configurations, but there are two basic types, according to how HP and LP piston strokes are phased and hence whether the HP exhaust is able to pass directly from HP to LP (Woolf compounds) or whether pressure fluctuation necessitates an intermediate &quot;buffer&quot; space in the form of a steam chest or pipe known as a &quot;receiver&quot; (receiver compounds).

In a single-expansion (or &#x27;simple&#x27;) steam engine, the high-pressure steam enters the cylinder at boiler pressure through an inlet valve. The steam pressure forces the piston down the cylinder, until the valve shuts (e.g. after 25% of the piston&#x27;s stroke). After the steam supply is cut off the trapped steam continues to expand, pushing the piston to the end of its stroke, where the exhaust valve opens and expels the partially depleted steam to the atmosphere, or to a condenser. This &quot;cut-off&quot; allows much more work to be extracted, since the expansion of the steam is doing additional work beyond that done by the steam at boiler pressure.

An earlier cut-off increases the expansion ratio, which in principle allows more energy to be extracted and increases efficiency. Ideally, the steam would expand adiabatically, and the temperature would drop corresponding to the volume increase. However, in practice the material of the surrounding cylinder acts as a heat reservoir, cooling the steam in the earlier part of the expansion and heating it in the later part. These irreversible heat flows decrease the efficiency of the process, so that beyond a certain point, further increasing the expansion ratio would actually decrease efficiency, in addition to decreasing the mean effective pressure and thus the power of the engine.

===Compounding engines===
A solution to the dilemma was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his &quot;Woolf high pressure compound engine&quot; in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler first expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam occurs across multiple cylinders and, as there is less expansion in each cylinder, the steam cools less in each cylinder, making higher expansion ratios practical and increasing the efficiency of the engine.

There are other advantages: as the temperature range is smaller, cylinder condensation is reduced. Loss due to condensation is restricted to the LP cylinder. Pressure difference is less in each cylinder so there is less steam leakage at the piston and valves. The turning moment is more uniform, so balancing is easier and a smaller flywheel may be used. Only the smaller HP cylinder needs to be built to withstand the highest pressure, which reduces the overall weight. Similarly, components are subject to less strain, so they can be lighter. The reciprocating parts of the engine are lighter, reducing the engine vibrations. The compound could be started at any point in the cycle, and in the event of mechanical failure the compound could be reset to act as a simple, and thus keep running.

To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and in rare cases the stroke as well, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.

Double-expansion (usually just known as &#x27;compound&#x27;) engines expand the steam in two stages, but this does not imply that all such engines have two cylinders. They may have four cylinders working as two LP-HP pairs, or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders, with one HP cylinder exhausting into either LP cylinder, giving a 3-cylinder layout where the cylinder and piston diameter of all three are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.

Two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:
* Cross-compound – the cylinders are side by side
* Tandem compound – the cylinders are end to end, driving a common connecting rod
* Telescopic-compound – the cylinders are one inside the other
* Angle-compound – the cylinders are arranged in a vee (usually at a 90° angle) and drive a common crank.

The adoption of compounding was widespread for stationary industrial units where the need was for increased power at decreasing cost, and almost universal for marine engines after 1880. It was not widely used in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated and unsuitable for the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge (particularly in Britain). Compounding was never common on British railways and not employed at all after 1930, but was used in a limited way in many other countries.

The first successful attempt to fly a heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft solely on steam power occurred in 1933, when George and William Besler converted a Travel Air 2000 biplane to fly on a 150 hp angle-compound V-twin steam engine of their own design instead of the usual Curtiss OX-5 inline or radial aviation gasoline engine it would have normally used.

===Multiple-expansion engines ===

It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple-expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as &quot;triple-&quot; and &quot;quadruple-expansion engines&quot; respectively. These engines use a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke and hence volume. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four equal portions, one for each expansion stage. The adjacent image shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right. The valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder.

== History ==
===Early work===

*1781 – Jonathan Hornblower, the grandson of one of Newcomen&#x27;s engine erectors in Cornwall, patented a double-cylinder compound reciprocating beam engine in 1781. He was prevented from developing it further by James Watt, who claimed his own patents were infringed.
*1797 - Richard Trevithick develops an effective high pressure steam engine.
*1804 – Arthur Woolf develops the stationary &quot;Woolf high-pressure compound engine&quot;, patented in 1805. The Woolf engine lessened the increased magnitude of the continual heating and cooling of a single-expansion high pressure steam engine that leads to inefficiency. It also solved the problem that the contemporary cast iron cylinders could not handle it well.

===Double-expansion===
*1833 – Hercules (1829) was modified to use an extra low pressure cylinder, taken from Agrippina, with steam from her high-pressure cylinders. This modification was designed by Dutch engineer Gerhard Moritz Roentgen, making him the inventor of the naval compound steam engine. The steam paddle tugboat was then successfully used for service on the river Waal, becoming the first ship with a compound steam engine to enter service.
*1845 – William McNaught devised a method of fixing an additional high-pressure cylinder within an existing beam engine. To do so involved using a long pipe to connect the cylinders, and an extra set of valves to balance them. In effect this acted as a receiving chest, and a new type of compound had been invented. This system allowed greater control of the steam intake and cut-offs. An engine could be slowed by either a throttle which reduced the pressure of the steam, or by adjusting the cut-off on either cylinder. The latter was more efficient as no power was lost. The cycle was smoother as the two cylinders were not in phase.
*1865 – was launched, equipped with a 300hp compound steam engine. The engine was designed by Alfred Holt, one of her owners. Holt had persuaded the Board of Trade to allow a boiler pressure of 60psi instead of the normal 25psi - a higher pressure was needed to realise the advantages of double-expansion. The efficiency obtained enabled this ship to travel 8,500 miles before coaling. This made her competitive on routes between China and Britain.

===Multiple-expansion===

*1861 – Daniel Adamson took out a patent for a multiple-expansion engine, with three or more cylinders connected to one beam or crankshaft. He built a triple-expansion engine for Victoria Mills, Dukinfield which opened in 1867.
*1871 – Charles Normand, of Le Havre fitted a triple-expansion engine to a Seine river boat in 1871.
*1872 – Sir Fredrick J. Bramwell reported that compound marine engines, operating at 45psi to 60psi, consumed 2 lbs to 2.5 lbs of coal per hour per indicated horsepower.
*1881 – Alexander Carnegie Kirk built SS &quot;Aberdeen&quot;, the first major ship to be successfully powered by a triple expansion engine. The success relied on solving the problem of designing a boiler that could operate at the (then) high pressures needed to realise the benefits of triple expansion.
*1887 – HMS &quot;Victoria&quot; launched, the first battleship to be powered by triple expansion engines.
*1891 – Triple expansion compound marine engines, operating at 160psi, consumed on average about 1.5 lbs of coal per hour per indicated horsepower.

==Applications==
===Pumping engines===
===Mill engines===
Though the first mills were driven by water power, once steam engines were adopted the manufacturer no longer needed to site the mills by running water. Cotton spinning required ever larger mills to fulfil the demand, and this drove the owners to demand increasingly powerful engines. When boiler pressure had exceeded 60 psi, compound engines achieved a thermo-dynamic advantage, but it was the mechanical advantages of the smoother stroke that was the deciding factor in the adoption of compounds. In 1859, there was 75,886 ihp (indicated horsepower) of engines in mills in the Manchester area, of which 32,282 ihp was provided by compounds though only 41,189 ihp was generated from boilers operated at over 60psi.

To generalise, between 1860 and 1926 all Lancashire mills were driven by compounds. The last compound built was by Buckley and Taylor for Wye No.2 mill, Shaw. This engine was a cross-compound design to 2,500 ihp, driving a 24 ft, 90 ton flywheel, and operated until 1965.

===Marine applications===

In the marine environment, the general requirement was for autonomy and increased operating range, as ships had to carry their coal supplies. The old salt-water boiler was thus no longer adequate and had to be replaced by a closed fresh-water circuit with condenser. The result from 1880 onwards was the multiple-expansion engine using three or four expansion stages (&quot;triple-&quot; and &quot;quadruple-expansion engines&quot;). These engines used a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke (and hence volume) designed to divide the work into three or four, as appropriate, equal portions for each expansion stage. Where space is at a premium, two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume might be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged in-line, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing &#x27;system&#x27; was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free steam turbine.

The development of this type of engine was important for its use in steamships as by exhausting to a condenser the water could be reclaimed to feed the boiler, which was unable to use seawater. Land-based steam engines could simply exhaust much of their steam, as feed water was usually readily available. Prior to and during World War II, the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential. It was superseded by the steam turbine when speed was required, such as for warships and ocean liners. HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.

===Application to railway locomotives===

For railway locomotive applications the main benefit sought from compounding was economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power/weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place over a longer cycle, this resulting in increased efficiency; additional perceived advantages included more even torque.

While designs for compound locomotives may date as far back as James Samuel&#x27;s 1856 patent for a &quot;continuous expansion locomotive&quot;, the practical history of railway compounding begins with Anatole Mallet&#x27;s designs in the 1870s. Mallet locomotives were operated in the United States up to the end of mainline steam by the Norfolk and Western Railway. The designs of Alfred George de Glehn in France also saw significant use, especially in the rebuilds of André Chapelon. A wide variety of compound designs were tried around 1900, but most were short-lived in popularity, due to their complexity and maintenance liability. In the 20th century the superheater was widely adopted, and the vast majority of steam locomotives were simple-expansion (with some compound locomotives converted to simple). It was realised by engineers that locomotives at steady speed were worked most efficiently with a wide-open regulator and early cut-off, the latter being set via the reversing gear. A locomotive operating at very early cut-off of steam (e.g. at 15% of the piston stroke) allows maximum expansion of the steam, with less wasted energy at the end of the stroke. Superheating eliminates the condensation and rapid loss of pressure that would otherwise occur with such expansion.

Large American locomotives used two cross-compound steam-driven air compressors, e.g. the Westinghouse 8 1/2&quot; 150-D, for the train brakes.

== The Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy system ==
The presentation follows Sommerfeld&#x27;s textbook, which contains a diagram (Figure 17) that is not reproduced for copyright reasons.

Consider a 4-cylinder engine on a ship. Let x be the vertical direction, z be the fore-aft direction, and y be the port-starboard direction. Let the 4 cylinders be mounted in a row along the z-axis, so that their pistons are pointed downwards. The pistons are connected to the same crankshaft via long vertical rods. Now, we set up the fundamental quantities of the engine:

* Let formula_1 be the effective masses of the compounded piston-rod system of each cylinder.
* Let cylinder 2 to be separated from cylinder 1 with a distance of formula_2 along the z-axis, and similarly for formula_3.
* Let formula_4 be the length of each rod of the cylinder.
* Let formula_5 be the radii of the crankshaft connector of each cylinder.
* Let formula_6 be the angle of the crankshaft connector of each cylinder.
* Since the crankshaft is turned in tandem by all cylinders, formula_7 is a constant formula_8 for each of formula_9.

Now, as the engine operates, the vertical position of cylinder formula_10 is equal to formula_11. By trigonometry, we have

formula_12

As each cylinder moves up and down, it exerts a vertical force on its mounting frame equaling formula_13. The YST system aims to make sure that the total of all 4 forces cancels out as exactly as possible. Specifically, it aims to make sure that the total force (along the x-axis) and the total torque (around the y-axis) are both zero:

formula_14

This can be achieved if

formula_15

Now, plugging in the equations, we find that it means (up to second-order)

formula_16

Plugging in formula_17, and expand the cosine functions, we see that with formula_18 arbitrary, the factors of formula_19 must vanish separately. This gives us 8 equations to solve, which is in general possible if there are at least 8 variables of the system that we can vary.

Of the variables of the system, formula_20 are fixed by the design of the cylinders. Also, the absolute values of formula_21 do not matter, only their ratios matter. Together, this gives us 9 variables to vary: formula_22.

The YST system requires at least 4 cylinders. With 3 cylinders, the same derivation gives us only 6 variables to vary, which is insufficient to solve all 8 equations.

The YST system is used on ships such as the SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and SS Deutschland (1900).

<doc id="1084219" wikidata="Q499964" url="?curid=1084219" title="Gravimetry">
<text>Gravimetry is the measurement of the strength of a gravitational field. Gravimetry may be used when either the magnitude of a gravitational field or the properties of matter responsible for its creation are of interest. The study of gravity changes belongs to geodynamics.

==Units of measurement==
Gravity is usually measured in units of acceleration. In the SI system of units, the standard unit of acceleration is metres per second squared (m/s2). Other units include the cgs gal (sometimes known as a &quot;galileo&quot;, in either case with symbol Gal), which equals 1 centimetre per second squared, and the &quot;g&quot; (&quot;g&quot;n), equal to 9.80665 m/s2. The value of the &quot;g&quot;n is defined as approximately equal to the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface, although the actual acceleration varies slightly by location.

==Gravimeters==

A gravimeter is an instrument used to measure gravitational acceleration. Every mass has an associated gravitational potential. The gradient of this potential is a force. A gravimeter measures this gravitational force.

For a small body, general relativity predicts gravitational effects indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration by the equivalence principle. Thus, gravimeters can be regarded as special-purpose accelerometers. Many weighing scales may be regarded as simple gravimeters. In one common form, a spring is used to counteract the force of gravity pulling on an object. The change in length of the spring may be calibrated to the force required to balance the gravitational pull. The resulting measurement may be made in units of force (such as the newton), however, gravimeters display their measurements in units of gals (cm/s2), and parts per million, parts per billion, or parts per trillion of the average vertical acceleration with respect to the Earth.

Though similar in design to other accelerometers, gravimeters are typically designed to be much more sensitive. Their first uses were to measure the changes in gravity from the varying densities and distribution of masses inside the Earth, from temporal tidal variations in the shape and distribution of mass in the oceans, atmosphere and earth.

The resolution of gravimeters can be increased by averaging samples over longer periods. Fundamental characteristics of gravimeters are the accuracy of a single measurement (a single &quot;sample&quot;) and the sampling rate.

:formula_1

for example:

:formula_2

Besides precision, is also an important property for a gravimeter as it allows the monitoring of gravity &quot;changes&quot;. These changes can be the result of mass displacements inside the Earth, or of vertical movements of the Earth&#x27;s crust on which measurements are being made.

The first gravimeters were vertical accelerometers, specialized for measuring the constant downward acceleration of gravity on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The Earth&#x27;s vertical gravity varies from place to place over its surface by about ±0.5%. It varies by about (nanometers per second squared) at any location because of the changing positions of the Sun and Moon relative to the Earth.

The majority of modern gravimeters use specially designed metal or quartz zero-length springs to support the test mass. The special property of these springs is that the natural resonant period of oscillation of the spring–mass system can be made very longapproaching a thousand seconds. This detunes the test mass from most local vibration and mechanical noise, increasing the sensitivity and utility of the gravimeter. Quartz and metal springs are chosen for different reasons; quartz springs are less affected by magnetic and electric fields while metal springs have a much lower drift due to elongation over time. The test mass is sealed in an air-tight container so that tiny changes of barometric pressure from blowing wind and other weather do not change the buoyancy of the test mass in air. Spring gravimeters are, in practice, relative instruments that measure the difference in gravity between different locations. A relative instrument also requires calibration by comparing instrument readings taken at locations with known absolute values of gravity.

Absolute gravimeters provide such measurements by determining the gravitational acceleration of a test mass in a vacuum. A test mass is allowed to fall freely inside a vacuum chamber and its position is measured with a laser interferometer and timed with an atomic clock. The laser wavelength is known to ±0.025 ppb and the clock is stable to ±0.03 ppb. Care must be taken to minimize the effects of perturbing forces such as residual air resistance (even in a vacuum), vibration, and magnetic forces. Such instruments are capable of an accuracy of about 2 ppb or 0.002 mGal and reference their measurement to atomic standards of length and time. Their primary use is for calibrating relative instruments, monitoring crustal deformation, and in geophysical studies requiring high accuracy and stability. However, absolute instruments are somewhat larger and significantly more expensive than relative spring gravimeters and are thus relatively rare.

Relative gravimeter usually refer to comparisons of gravity from one place to another. They are designed to subtract the average vertical gravity automatically. They can be calibrated at a location where the gravity is known accurately and then transported to where gravity is to be measured. Or they can be calibrated in absolute units at their operating location.

===Applications===
Researchers use more sophisticated gravimeters when precise measurements are needed. When measuring Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, measurements are made to the precision of microgals to find density variations in the rocks making up the Earth. Several types of gravimeters exist for making these measurements, including some that are essentially refined versions of the spring scale described above. These measurements are used to quantify gravity anomalies.

Gravimeters can detect vibrations and gravity changes from human activities. Depending on the interests of the researcher or operator, this might be counteracted by integral vibration isolation and signal processing.

Gravimeters have been designed to mount in vehicles, including aircraft (note the field of aerogravity), ships and submarines. These special gravimeters isolate acceleration from the vehicle&#x27;s movement and subtract it from measurements. The acceleration of the vehicles is often hundreds or thousands of times stronger than the changes in gravity being measured.

The Lunar Surface Gravimeter was deployed on the surface of the Moon during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission but did not work due to a design error. A second device carried on the same mission, the Lunar Traverse Gravimeter, functioned as anticipated.

Gravimeters are used for petroleum and mineral prospecting, seismology, geodesy, geophysical surveys and other geophysical research, and for metrology. Their fundamental purpose is to map the gravity field in space and time.

Most current work is Earth-based, with a few satellites around Earth, but gravimeters are also applicable to the Moon, Sun, planets, asteroids, stars, galaxies and other bodies. Gravitational wave experiments monitor the changes with time in the gravitational potential itself, rather than the gradient of the potential that the gravimeter is tracking. This distinction is somewhat arbitrary. The subsystems of the gravitational radiation experiments are very sensitive to changes in the gradient of the potential. The local gravity signals on Earth that interfere with gravitational wave experiments are disparagingly referred to as &quot;Newtonian noise&quot;, since Newtonian gravity calculations are sufficient to characterize many of the local (earth-based) signals.

===Commercial absolute gravimeters===

Gravimeters for measuring the Earth&#x27;s gravity as precisely as possible are getting smaller and more portable. A common type measures the acceleration of small masses free falling in a vacuum, when the accelerometer is firmly attached to the ground. The mass includes a retroreflector and terminates one arm of a Michelson interferometer. By counting and timing the interference fringes, the acceleration of the mass can be measured. A more recent development is a &quot;rise and fall&quot; version that tosses the mass upward and measures both upward and downward motion. This allows cancellation of some measurement errors; however, &quot;rise and fall&quot; gravimeters are not yet in common use. Absolute gravimeters are used in the calibration of relative gravimeters, surveying for gravity anomalies (voids), and for establishing the vertical control network.

Atom interferometric and atomic fountain methods are used for precise measurement of the Earth&#x27;s gravity, and atomic clocks and purpose-built instruments can use time dilation (also called general relativistic) measurements to track changes in the gravitational potential and gravitational acceleration on the Earth.

The term &quot;absolute&quot; does not convey the instrument&#x27;s stability, sensitivity, accuracy, ease of use, and bandwidth. The words &quot;Absolute&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; should not be used when more specific characteristics can be given.

===Relative gravimeters===
The most common gravimeters are spring-based. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over those areas. They are basically a weight on a spring, and by measuring the amount by which the weight stretches the spring, local gravity can be measured. However, the strength of the spring must be calibrated by placing the instrument in a location with a known gravitational acceleration.

The current standard for sensitive gravimeters are the &quot;superconducting gravimeters&quot;, which operate by suspending a superconducting niobium sphere in an extremely stable magnetic field; the current required to generate the magnetic field that suspends the niobium sphere is proportional to the strength of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration. The superconducting gravimeter achieves sensitivities of (one nanogal), approximately one trillionth (10) of the Earth surface gravity. In a demonstration of the sensitivity of the superconducting gravimeter, Virtanen (2006), describes how an instrument at Metsähovi, Finland, detected the gradual increase in surface gravity as workmen cleared snow from its laboratory roof.

The largest component of the signal recorded by a superconducting gravimeter is the tidal gravity of the Sun and Moon acting at the station. This is roughly (nanometers per second squared) at most locations. &quot;SGs&quot;, as they are called, can detect and characterize Earth tides, changes in the density of the atmosphere, the effect of changes in the shape of the surface of the ocean, the effect of the atmosphere&#x27;s pressure on the Earth, changes in the rate of rotation of the Earth, oscillations of the Earth&#x27;s core, distant and nearby seismic events, and more.

Many broadband three-axis seismometers in common use are sensitive enough to track the Sun and Moon. When operated to report acceleration, they are useful gravimeters. Because they have three axes, it is possible to solve for their position and orientation, by either tracking the arrival time and pattern of seismic waves from earthquakes, or by referencing them to the Sun and Moon tidal gravity.

Recently, the SGs, and broadband three-axis seismometers operated in gravimeter mode, have begun to detect and characterize the small gravity signals from earthquakes. These signals arrive at the gravimeter at the speed of light, so have the potential to improve earthquake early warning methods. There is some activity to design purpose-built gravimeters of sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth to detect these prompt gravity signals from earthquakes. Not just the magnitude 7+ events, but also the smaller, much more frequent, events.

Newer MEMS gravimeters, atom gravimeters – MEMS gravimeters offer the potential for low-cost arrays of sensors. MEMS gravimeters are currently variations on spring type accelerometers where the motions of a tiny cantilever or mass are tracked to report acceleration. Much of the research is focused on different methods of detecting the position and movements of these small masses. In Atom gravimeters, the mass is a collection of atoms.

For a given restoring force, the central frequency of the instrument is often given by

:formula_3 (in radians per second)

The term for the &quot;force constant&quot; changes if the restoring force is electrostatic, magnetostatic, electromagnetic, optical, microwave, acoustic, or any of dozens of different ways to keep the mass stationary. The &quot;force constant&quot; is just the coefficient of the displacement term in the equation of motion:

:m mass, a acceleration, b viscosity, v velocity, k force constant, x displacement
:F external force as a function of location/position and time.

F is the force being measured, and is the acceleration.

: + higher derivatives of the restoring force

Precise GPS stations can be operated as gravimeters since they are increasingly measuring three-axis positions over time, which, when differentiated twice, give an acceleration signal.

The satellite borne gravimeters GOCE, GRACE, mostly operated in gravity gradiometer mode. They yielded detailed information about the Earth&#x27;s time-varying gravity field. The spherical harmonic gravitational potential models are slowly improving in both spatial and temporal resolution. Taking the gradient of the potentials gives estimate of local acceleration which are what is measured by the gravimeter arrays. The superconducting gravimeter network has been used to ground truth the satellite potentials. This should eventually improve both the satellite and Earth-based methods and intercomparisons.

Transportable relative gravimeters also exist; they employ an extremely stable inertial platform to compensate for the masking effects of motion and vibration, a difficult engineering feat. The first transportable relative gravimeters were, reportedly, a secret military technology developed in the 1950–1960s as a navigational aid for nuclear submarines. Subsequently in the 1980s, transportable relative gravimeters were reverse engineered by the civilian sector for use on ship, then in air and finally satellite-borne gravity surveys.

==Microgravimetry==
Microgravimetry is an important branch developed on the foundation of classical gravimetry. Microgravity investigations are carried out in order to solve various problems of engineering geology, mainly location of voids and their monitoring. Very detailed measurements of high accuracy can indicate voids of any origin, provided the size and depth are large enough to produce gravity effect stronger than is the level of confidence of relevant gravity signal.

==History==
The modern gravimeter was developed by Lucien LaCoste and Arnold Romberg in 1936.

They also invented most subsequent refinements, including the ship-mounted gravimeter, in 1965, temperature-resistant instruments for deep boreholes, and lightweight hand-carried instruments. Most of their designs remain in use with refinements in data collection and data processing.

==Satellite gravimetry==
Currently, the static and time-variable Earth&#x27;s gravity field parameters are determined using modern satellite missions, such as GOCE, CHAMP, Swarm, GRACE and GRACE-FO. The lowest-degree parameters, including the Earth&#x27;s oblateness and geocenter motion are best determined from satellite laser ranging.

Large-scale gravity anomalies can be detected from space, as a by-product of satellite gravity missions, e.g., GOCE. These satellite missions aim at the recovery of a detailed gravity field model of the Earth, typically presented in the form of a spherical-harmonic expansion of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational potential, but alternative presentations, such as maps of geoid undulations or gravity anomalies, are also produced.

The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) consisted of two satellites that detected gravitational changes across the Earth. Also these changes could be presented as gravity anomaly temporal variations. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) also consisted of two spacecraft orbiting the Moon, which orbited for three years before their deorbit in 2015.

<text>USS &quot;Hoe&quot; (SS-258), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the hoe, one of various sharks, especially the dogfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hoe&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, on 2 January 1942. She was launched on 17 September 1942, sponsored by Miss Helen Hess, and commissioned on 16 December 1942.

== First and second war patrols, May – October 1943 ==

After shakedown, &quot;Hoe&quot; sailed 19 April 1943 via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 15 May. She departed on her first combat war patrol 27 May, and patrolled the Guam-Palaus area. &quot;Hoe&quot; damaged two freighters before returning 11 July to Pearl Harbor via Ulithi and Midway Atoll.

&quot;Hoe&quot;&#x27;s second patrol, conducted west of Truk, was marred by considerable engine trouble. The submarine departed 21 August, damaged one tanker, and eluded several depth charge attacks before returning to Pearl Harbor 18 October 1943. She also took part in the search for downed aviators off Wake Island, 8–9 October.

== Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, January – August 1944 ==

Following extensive repairs, &quot;Hoe&quot; set out on her third patrol 26 January 1944. Patrolling between Mindanao and Halmahera, the submarine made an attack 16 February which damaged one ship. Although shadowed by escort vessels, &quot;Hoe&quot; detected another convoy 25 February and in two separate attacks sank tanker &quot;Nissho Maru&quot;. She returned to Fremantle, Australia, 5 March for refit and training.

&quot;Hoe&quot; began her fourth war patrol from Fremantle 4 April, and operated in the South China Sea, the vital Japanese sea supply line. She attacked a convoy 8 May, but scored no hits. Two more attacks 17 May and 19 May resulted in several damaged freighters and severe retaliatory depth charge attacks on &quot;Hoe&quot;. She returned to Fremantle 2 June 1944. Her fifth war patrol, in the same area, was conducted between 29 June and 23 August 1944.

== Sixth and seventh war patrols, September 1944 – January 1945 ==

The veteran submarine sailed on her sixth patrol 15 September as leader of a coordinated attack group consisting of &quot;Hoe&quot;, , and . Operating southwest of Lingayen Gulf, the submarines accounted for some 38,000 tons of valuable Japanese shipping in five night surface attacks. &quot;Hoe&quot; was credited with the sinking of passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kohoko Maru&quot; 8 October, and returned to Fremantle 22 October.

Her seventh patrol, 23 November 1944 to 3 January 1945, resulted in no sinkings. Part of this cruise was conducted in coordination with and .

== Eighth war patrol, February – March 1945 ==

&quot;Hoe&quot;&#x27;s final war patrol began 8 February 1945, when she again headed for the South China Sea. By this time the vigorous American submarine offensive had taken its toll and little Japanese shipping could be found. The submarine did detect a tanker with an escort 25 February and in a well-conducted submerged attack sank the escort, &quot;Shōnan&quot;.

Two days before, while patrolling off Indochina, she and had been involved in one of the most unusual accidents of the war. While steaming at a depth of &quot;Hoe&quot; struck an object and broached, sustaining only light damage. Subsequent analysis proved that she had actually collided with &quot;Flounder&quot;, one of the few submerged collisions on record. Ending her last patrol at Pearl Harbor 6 March, &quot;Hoe&quot; returned to the United States for overhaul and repairs.

== Post-war service ==

She sailed again for the Western Pacific 5 July 1945 and was just entering Apra Harbor, Guam, when the war ended. A few days later she sailed for the East Coast via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, arriving New York 29 September 1945.

&quot;Hoe&quot; decommissioned 7 August 1946 at New London, Conn., and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In September 1956 she was taken out of reserve to act as a Naval Reserve Training Ship in a noncommissioned status in the 3rd Naval District. She was subsequently sold 23 August 1960 to Laneett Inc., Boston, Massachusetts.

Hoe received seven battle stars for World War II service. Her first, third, fourth, sixth, and eighth patrols were designated successful.

<doc id="1084250" wikidata="Q980971" url="?curid=1084250" title="Mentone, Texas">
<text>Mentone () is an unincorporated town in and the county seat of Loving County, Texas, United States. As of 2020, the population was 22, up from a population of 19 in 2010, almost one-quarter of the county&#x27;s 82 people at the time.

Mentone was, until recent years, the least-populated unincorporated county seat in the United States, but lost that distinction with the 2010 census to Gann Valley, South Dakota, which had a population of 14. Mentone was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1967 as the &quot;Smallest County Seat in Texas&quot;.

==History==
Named after Menton, France, by a French surveyor, present-day Mentone is actually the second such named community in Loving County; an earlier Mentone was founded south of the current town in 1893, but was abandoned in 1905. A second town on that site was called Juanita and then Porterville, but was deserted anew when Mentone was re-established in 1931, with most residents moving to the new town. The town on the current site was named Ramsey before being renamed. During its heyday, Mentone boasted five cafes, five gas stations, two hotels, two drugstores, two recreation halls, two barbershops, a dance hall, a machine shop, and a dry cleaner. It also had its own newspaper, the &quot;Mentone Monitor&quot;, which published from 1932 to 1935.

After reaching a high population mark around 600 residents in the 1930s, the population has declined ever since, and in 2000, it had only 15 people, &quot;more or less&quot;, according to &quot;National Geographic&quot; (the total population of Loving County itself, as of 2020, was 64).

Today, according to &quot;National Geographic,&quot; Mentone contains little more than a courthouse, two stop signs, a gas station, a post office, and a school building (which has since been demolished, as enrollment fell to just two pupils and was merged with nearby Wink schools in the 1970s). A volunteer fire department serves the town, but no hospitals or cemeteries are there, and no doctors or lawyers. Until 1988, Mentone had no potable water of its own; local wells yielded water with a high mineral content that clogged pipes and killed grass. Drinking water was trucked in from Pecos, away, until improvements started in 2010 that guaranteed the potability of Mentone&#x27;s water.

Mentone&#x27;s tiny church (the oldest building in Loving County) is visited every Saturday by a minister from a nearby town who holds interdenominational services there.

Mentone was the home of the first elected female sheriff in Texas, Edna Reed Clayton DeWees, who was appointed to the job in January 1945, then won an election to continue in the office through 1947. She never carried a firearm, and reported only two arrests during her entire term. This is not unusual in Loving County; since the inception of the county, fewer than 200 criminal cases have been filed in District Court. Later, DeWees returned as county and district clerk, a job she held from 1965 to 1986. In Loving County, the posts of county clerk, probate clerk, and district clerk are managed by the same official. DeWees died January 22, 2009, having survived her husbands George Clayton and Lawrence DeWees.

===Free Town Project===

In February 2006, Mentone became the focus of a &quot;New York Times&quot; article detailing an alleged attempt by Lawrence Pendarvis, a man convicted of 129 counts of possession of child pornography, Bobby Emory, and Don Duncan to &quot;take over&quot; the town and Loving County. According to the article, Pendarvis and his associates, part of the &quot;Free Town Project&quot;, planned to buy parcels of land in the county, then move in enough of their supporters to outvote earlier residents and take control of local government.

According to a website for Pendarvis&#x27; movement, their objectives were to &quot;Remove oppressive regulations... and stop enforcement of laws prohibiting victimless acts among consenting adults&quot; Additionally, the group sought &quot;to ensure that the sheriff&#x27;s office or the town police are never allowed to waste valuable town resources... to oppress our residents by the investigation or enforcement of violations of laws that punish truancy, drug trafficking, prostitution, obscenity, organ trafficking, and other victimless &#x27;crimes&#x27;.&quot;

Although Pendarvis, Emory, and Duncan claimed to have legally bought in Loving County in 2005, and registered to vote accordingly, the county sheriff, Billy Burt Hopper, determined that this land had been sold to a different buyer. Misdemeanor charges were filed against the three men, who had left the state by this time. Pendarvis claimed to have a cancelled check to prove his purchase of the land in question, but no deed was ever produced, and the original landowners denied having sold land to Pendarvis or his associates. The three were subsequently featured on a &quot;wanted&quot; poster issued by Sheriff Hopper and the local Texas Rangers (displayed at Hopper&#x27;s office), and threatened with arrest should they return to Loving County.

As of 2017, Pendarvis&#x27; website is no longer operational.

==Geography==
Mentone is located in southwestern Loving County at an elevation of . It is situated on State Highway 302, west of Odessa and north of Pecos. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Mentone CDP has an area of , all land. The town is east of the Pecos River.

=== Climate ===
Mentone experiences an arid desert climate with hot summers and cool winters. Due to Mentone&#x27;s aridity, the diurnal temperature variation is substantial, and helps lower nighttime temperatures. Most precipitation falls in the summer and early fall.
==Demographics==
Since 2010, Mentone has been included in the larger Mentone, Texas census-designated place delineated by the United States Census Bureau for its purposes in compiling, storing and analyzing census data. Because of this, demographics taken from this census apply to the entire CDP and not just the community proper.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 22 people, 7 households, and 3 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Mentone is served by the Wink-Loving Independent School District. Loving County&#x27;s school system was closed and consolidated into Wink&#x27;s ISD in 1972 because the enrollment had fallen to two students.
All of Loving County is zoned to Odessa College.

<text>Maffei was a manufacturer of railway locomotives based in Munich, Germany. Established in 1836, it prospered for nearly a century before going bankrupt in 1930 and becoming amalgamated with the firm of Krauss to form Krauss-Maffei. Following another 70 years of prosperity Krauss-Maffei merged with Demag and Mannesmann in 1999, the resulting conglomerate in turn being sold to Siemens AG.

Perhaps J. A. Maffei&#x27;s most famous product was the S3/6 4-6-2 locomotive of 1908.

In 1836, Joseph Anton, Ritter von Maffei established the &quot;J. A. Maffei&quot; locomotive works in the English Garden district of Munich. The aim was to make Bavaria competitive in the machine industry. From these small beginnings a locomotive works eventually developed.
In 1864, they delivered their 500th locomotive. Maffei, as a Munich town councillor, was praised for the building of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof. Well-known products of the locomotive works are the Bavarian S 2/6 express locomotive which held the 1907 German speed record of 154.5 km/h) and the Bavarian S 3/6. Examples of the S 3/6 are preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich and in the Nuremberg Transport Museum.

Maffei, amongst other things, involved itself with the building of the Augsburg Munich line and supported Johann Ulrich Himbsel in the building of the Munich - Starnberg line. Maffei, at Lake Starnberg, built their first steamer &quot;Maximilian&quot;. By 1926, they had built 44 steam ships.

In 1930, the form of J.A.Maffei went into bankruptcy and in 1931, merged with the Krauss Company to form Krauss-Maffei. The Maffei mansion in Feldafing, by Lake Starnberg, today houses a museum and exhibitions.</text><links>

<doc id="1084263" wikidata="Q417383" url="?curid=1084263" title="Glutamate dehydrogenase">
<text>Glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH, GDH) is an enzyme observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic mitochondria. The aforementioned reaction also yields ammonia, which in eukaryotes is canonically processed as a substrate in the urea cycle. Typically, the α-ketoglutarate to glutamate reaction does not occur in mammals, as glutamate dehydrogenase equilibrium favours the production of ammonia and α-ketoglutarate. Glutamate dehydrogenase also has a very low affinity for ammonia (high Michaelis constant formula_1 of about 1 mM), and therefore toxic levels of ammonia would have to be present in the body for the reverse reaction to proceed (that is, α-ketoglutarate and ammonia to glutamate and NAD(P)+). In the brain, the NAD+/NADH ratio in brain mitochondria encourages oxidative deamination (i.e. glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia). In bacteria, the ammonia is assimilated to amino acids via glutamate and aminotransferases. In plants, the enzyme can work in either direction depending on environment and stress. Transgenic plants expressing microbial GLDHs are improved in tolerance to herbicide, water deficit, and pathogen infections. They are more nutritionally valuable.

The enzyme represents a key link between catabolic and anabolic pathways, and is, therefore, ubiquitous in eukaryotes. In humans the relevant genes are called &quot;GLUD1&quot; (glutamate dehydrogenase 1) and &quot;GLUD2&quot; (glutamate dehydrogenase 2), and there are also at least five GLDH pseudogenes in the human genome as well.

==Clinical application==

GLDH can be measured in a medical laboratory to evaluate the liver function. Elevated blood serum GLDH levels indicate liver damage and GLDH plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of liver disease, especially in combination with aminotransferases. GLDH is localised in mitochondria, therefore practically none is liberated in generalised inflammatory diseases of the liver such as viral hepatitides. Liver diseases in which necrosis of hepatocytes is the predominant event, such as toxic liver damage or hypoxic liver disease, are characterised by high serum GLDH levels. GLDH is important for distinguishing between acute viral hepatitis and acute toxic liver necrosis or acute hypoxic liver disease, particularly in the case of liver damage with very high aminotransferases. In clinical trials, GLDH can serve as a measurement for the safety of a drug.

Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) can be used as screening tool for patients with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection. The enzyme is expressed constitutively by most strains of C.diff, and can thus be easily detected in stool. Diagnosis is generally confirmed with a follow-up EIA for C. Diff toxins A and B.

==Cofactors==
NAD+ (or NADP+) is a cofactor for the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction, producing α-ketoglutarate and ammonium as a byproduct.

Based on which cofactor is used, glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes are divided into the following three classes:
* EC 1.4.1.2: L-glutamate + H2O + NAD+ formula_2 2-oxoglutarate + NH3 + NADH + H+
* EC 1.4.1.3: L-glutamate + H2O + NAD(P)+ formula_2 2-oxoglutarate + NH3 + NAD(P)H + H+
* EC 1.4.1.4: L-glutamate + H2O + NADP+ formula_2 2-oxoglutarate + NH3 + NADPH + H+

==Role in flow of nitrogen==
Ammonia incorporation in animals and microbes occurs through the actions of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase. Glutamate plays the central role in mammalian and microbe nitrogen flow, serving as both a nitrogen donor and a nitrogen acceptor.

==Regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase==
In humans, the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase is controlled through ADP-ribosylation, a covalent modification carried out by the gene sirt4. This regulation is relaxed in response to caloric restriction and low blood glucose. Under these circumstances, glutamate dehydrogenase activity is raised in order to increase the amount of α-ketoglutarate produced, which can be used to provide energy by being used in the citric acid cycle to ultimately produce ATP.

In microbes, the activity is controlled by the concentration of ammonium and or the like-sized rubidium ion, which binds to an allosteric site on GLDH and changes the Km (Michaelis constant) of the enzyme.

The control of GLDH through ADP-ribosylation is particularly important in insulin-producing β cells. Beta cells secrete insulin in response to an increase in the ATP:ADP ratio, and, as amino acids are broken down by GLDH into α-ketoglutarate, this ratio rises and more insulin is secreted. SIRT4 is necessary to regulate the metabolism of amino acids as a method of controlling insulin secretion and regulating blood glucose levels.

Bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase was found to be regulated by nucleotides in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Carl Frieden.
 In addition to describing the effects of nucleotides like ADP, ATP and GTP he described in detail the different kinetic behavior of NADH and NADPH. As such it was one of the earliest enzymes to show what was later described as allosteric behavior.
The activation of mammalian GDH by L-leucine and some other hydrophobic amino acids has also been long known, however localization of the binding site was not clear. Only recently the new allosteric binding site for L-leucine was identified in a mammalian enzyme.

Mutations which alter the allosteric binding site of GTP cause permanent activation of glutamate dehydrogenase, and lead to hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome.

==Regulation==
Allosteric regulation:

This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.

Allosteric inhibitors:
* Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
* Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
* Palmitoyl-CoA
* Zn2+

Activators:
* Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
* Leucine
* l-isoleucine
* l-valine
* Guanosine diphosphate

Other Inhibitors:
* EGCG

Additionally, Mice GLDH shows substrate inhibition by which GLDH activity decreases at high glutamate concentrations.

== Isozymes ==

Humans express the following glutamate dehydrogenase isozymes:

<text>The Downpatrick and County Down Railway (DCDR) is a 5 foot, 3 inch (1,600 mm) gauge heritage railway in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is operated by volunteers and runs passenger trains using steam and diesel locomotives, diesel railcars, and vintage carriages. The railway has approximately three miles (4.8 km) of track in a triangular-shaped layout, which connects the town of Downpatrick with the historical sites of Inch Abbey to the north and King Magnus’ Grave to the south. It also houses a museum of railway artefacts and rolling stock originating from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, dating from the 1860s to the 1980s.

The DCDR&#x27;s development was spearheaded by a group of local railway enthusiasts in the early 1980s, and work started on building the railway in 1985. Most of its track is on part of the now-closed Belfast and County Down Railway (BCDR) mainline which ran between Belfast, Downpatrick, and Newcastle. The heritage railway first opened to the public in December 1987, and originally consisted of little more than a short stretch of track with an E-class diesel locomotive and a brake van. It has expanded incrementally since then, and reached its current length with the completion of the Inch Abbey line in 2005.

The DCDR is the only five-foot, three-inch gauge heritage railway in Ireland, which has been the standard gauge on the island since the 1840s. With its Downpatrick terminus located at the foot of Down Cathedral and next to the Saint Patrick Centre, the railway has become a major tourist attraction for the town and has accumulated several hundred members. It currently has three steam and eight diesel locomotives, five of which are on loan from the Irish Traction Group, as well as the largest collection of Victorian railway carriages in Ireland. Some of these have been overhauled by the railway&#x27;s volunteers from a dilapidated state, and have received awards for their restoration. 

==History==

=== Belfast and County Down Railway ===
The first railway in Downpatrick was opened to the public in March 1859, with the completion of the Belfast and County Down Railway mainline from Belfast Queen&#x27;s Quay. Downpatrick&#x27;s railway facilities included a substantial station building on Market Street, a two-road train shed, a goods store, an engine shed, and a turntable. The line was constructed under the management of the BCDR&#x27;s chief engineer Sir John Macneill, and included a bridge over the marshy estuary of the River Quoile, just outside Downpatrick. The original bridge consisted of lattice trusses supported by timber piles driven into the riverbed, and was replaced with a steel girder bridge in 1929. As it was built on the floodplain of the River Quoile, the line towards Downpatrick often suffered from flooding, particularly during the winter months.

The railway originally terminated at Downpatrick, but in 1869 a separate company, the Downpatrick, Dundrum and Newcastle Railway, built an extension from Downpatrick to the seaside town of Newcastle. The Newcastle line was operated by the BCDR and purchased by them in 1881. The extension created an inconvenience wherein a train running between Belfast and Newcastle had to stop in Downpatrick and uncouple its locomotive, which moved via a run-round loop to the other end of the train in order to continue its journey. This significantly increased journey times and caused excessive congestion at the Downpatrick terminus.

The opportunity arose in 1892 to end this cumbersome practice with the opening of the Downpatrick, Killough and Ardglass Railway and, with it, Downpatrick Loop Platform. The Ardglass line was built and operated by the BCDR, and branched off from their mainline about a kilometre south of Downpatrick station. In conjunction with this, a loop line was constructed to directly link the Newcastle and Belfast lines, with the Loop Platform located at the South Junction. This enabled Newcastle-bound trains from Belfast (and vice versa) to bypass the main Downpatrick station, and instead call at the Loop Platform where passengers intending for Downpatrick or Ardglass could board a local train. Meanwhile, the mainline train could carry on without having to run around. This resulted in an unusual triangular-shaped layout, the trackbed of which forms the basis of most of the DCDR&#x27;s operational railway line.

=== Decline and closure of the Belfast – Newcastle Line ===
Following the 1945 Ballymacarrett rail crash and the resultant £80,000 (the equivalent of over £3,530,000 in 2020) it had to pay in compensation, the BCDR was financially ruined. This was a deciding factor in the nationalisation of the company, which became part of the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) in 1948. The UTA&#x27;s railways were in need of significant investment following years of underfunding during World War II; as a result, Northern Ireland&#x27;s devolved government established a tribunal to determine the future of its public transport system. In December 1949 the tribunal authorised the closure of all ex-BCDR lines except the Bangor branch, as part of an effort to avoid excess expenditure on railway maintenance and to divert assets towards improving the UTA&#x27;s road services.

The entire Belfast – Newcastle line south of Comber, including Downpatrick, was closed on Sunday 15 January 1950. The track and almost all of the railway infrastructure was removed in 1953, and the station was used by the UTA&#x27;s bus division, which became Ulsterbus in 1968. Most of the trackbed along the line was sold by the UTA to private individuals who owned adjoining land: the trackbed in the Downpatrick area was sold to Charles Mulholland, 3rd Baron Dunleath, and was left largely undisturbed until the arrival of the DCDR. Although the 1929-built Quoile Bridge was dismantled for scrap, the Loop Platform and several smaller nearby bridges were left intact. The station building was demolished shortly after Ulsterbus moved to a new depot in the town in 1975, and part of the former station yard was used as a storage depot by the Department of the Environment&#x27;s Road Service.

=== Heritage Railway ===
Local architect Gerry Cochrane M.B.E. was inspired to start the scheme after taking a walk along the route of the line, and by 1982 had gained support to rebuild part of the line as a heritage steam railway from the local council. Lord Dunleath, whose father had purchased the railway trackbed adjacent to his estate after the closure of the BCDR in Downpatrick, gave the newly formed society a package of land on which to build the line and station for a peppercorn rent. This was on the approaches to the old Downpatrick station, which had been demolished in the 1970s. Work started on rebuilding the railway in 1985, with public trains finally running in the town again in Friday 4 December 1987, making it the first Irish gauge heritage railway in Ireland to carry passengers over its own track. Track has been relaid on nearly 6 km (4 mi) of Belfast and County Down Railway trackbed, and a 1.6 km (1 mi) extension south to the hamlet of Ballydugan is planned.

The railway began life as the Downpatrick &amp; Ardglass Railway, as the original intention was to extend the railway to this fishing port on the south coast of County Down. This name was dropped in 1996 following the abandonment of this proposal and the railway was renamed the Downpatrick Railway Museum until 2005 when the new name, Downpatrick &amp; County Down Railway was adopted following the opening of the Inch Abbey extension.

Between March 2020 and July 2022 (apart from a temporary resumption of service during Christmas 2021) the railway was closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteers continued work throughout the closure period, and normal service resumed on 16 July 2022

The railway was once again closed to the public in November 2023, after excessive rainfall during Storm Ciarán submerged the entire site under 3 - 6ft of floodwater for nearly a week. The railway was closed for almost a full year whilst volunteers assessed and repaired the damage caused by the flood to rolling stock and infrastructure, finally reopening on October 26 2024.

==Operations==

Approximately three miles (4.8 km) of Irish standard gauge track are open , along which a steam locomotive, currently either O&amp;K No. 1 or 3, and 1950s-60s era diesel locomotives are run, drawing preserved rolling stock. Passenger trains are usually operated with brake/generator standard class coach 3223, which was built in 1954 by Córas Iompair Éierann, brake/standard class coach 728, which was built in 1951 by the Ulster Transport Authority, and Park Royal brake/standard class coach 1944, also built in 1954 by Córas Iompair Éierann. Stock is added to or withdrawn from the &#x27;running set&#x27; as maintenance allows. Older carriages built by the Great Southern and Western Railway and Belfast and County Down Railway were operated on the line, but as 1950s/1960s stock became available the DCDR moved these vintage carriages inside for overhaul and display. These vintage coaches are now used on a select few special running days, such as European Heritage Open Days and for private contracts, as they are too historically important for everyday wear and tear.

The railway also aims to have an at least partially operational mechanical signalling system, using the preserved King&#x27;s Bog and Bundoran Junction signal cabins along with multiple semaphores that are on the site. Related to this is the Double Track Project, which will allow simultaneous operation on the North and South lines.

Every year, the DCDR operates the following trains:
* Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Specials, which are held on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day and operate to Inch Abbey.
* Easter Specials, which take place over a couple of days around the Easter Period, and operate to Inch Abbey.
* May Day Specials, which take place on May Day and operate to Inch Abbey.
* Summer Specials, which take place every weekend during summer and operate to Inch Abbey. Some of these days involve special events, as well as an annual diesel day. 
*EHOD Days, which run in conjunction with the last Summer Specials weekend. These offer visitors free cab rides in a diesel as well as behind-the-scenes tours.
* Halloween Specials, which take place on the weekend prior to, and on, Halloween night, and operate to Magnus&#x27; Grave.
* Santa Specials, which take place on the weekend prior to Christmas, and operate to the Loop Platform.
* Mince Pie Specials, which take place on either the last or last weekend of the year, and operate to Magnus&#x27; Grave or Inch Abbey - these are usually diesel-hauled.

Bank Holidays, shunts, private charters and film contracts make for extra trains throughout the year too.

On operating days, visitors have access to the BCDR Museum which is housed upstairs in Downpatrick railway station, the Downpatrick East signal cabin, a model railway room, the workshop viewing area (Where carriages can be seen undergoing restoration) and the Carriage Gallery.

A gift shop and buffet carriage, the latter of which will be parked at Inch Abbey or Downpatrick Loop Platform railway station, are open on operating days.

== Stations &amp; Buildings ==

=== Stations ===

* Downpatrick Station is the principal station on the DCDR network, where all passenger trains originate from. It has two platforms, though one of these is currently out of use. The original BCDR station was sited on Market Street, but was demolished and replaced by a supermarket before the DCDR was established.
* Downpatrick Loop Platform has no road access, which helped it to escape demolition in the 1950s. It serves as the interchange point between the DCDR&#x27;s South and Loop lines. Downpatrick Loop has two platforms.
* King Magnus&#x27; Halt is the current terminus of the South Line. It has one platform and serves the grave of Viking King Magnus Barefoot, a site previously inaccessible before the arrival of the railway. Magnus Halt was not an original BCDR station, though it is located at the site of the BCDR&#x27;s Ardglass Junction.
* Inch Abbey Halt is the current terminus of the North Line. It has two platforms and serves the ruins of Inch Abbey. The station was not part of the BCDR, as it is located on a short deviation away from the original trackbed.

=== Buildings &amp; Structures ===

Several of the railway&#x27;s buildings, including its engine shed and two signal cabins, are original railway structures that were first erected in different parts Northern Ireland and later rebuilt brick-by-brick at Downpatrick.

* Downpatrick Station Building was originally the town&#x27;s Gas Manager&#x27;s House, sited across the road from the DCDR and moved over brick-by-brick.
* Downpatrick Signal Cabin, a BNCR structure, was moved brick-by-brick from Kingsbog Junction on the Belfast–Derry line. 
* Downpatrick East Signal Cabin, a GNR structure, was originally Bundoran Junction&#x27;s North Cabin. It was moved to DCDR in 2011 and opened to the public in 2017.
* Downpatrick Locomotive Shed, a BNCR structure, was moved stone-by-stone from Maghera where it was originally the goods shed.
* Downpatrick Station Canopy was originally attached to the Maghera Shed.
* Downpatrick Water Tower was moved from Antrim station.
* The Arch, which spans the main gate, bears the name of the railway and is based on an original design at Cookstown.
* Bridges 163 &amp; 164 are original BCDR bridges, and carry the Back and South lines respectively across a narrow stream.
* Downpatrick Loop Platform and Canopy are the only BCDR buildings left in Downpatrick. 
* The Cutting is just beyond the limit of passenger operations on the South Line. It carries trains up a slight gradient, with vertical retaining walls on either side.
* The Quoile Bridge is the longest bridge on the DCDR. It carries the North Line over the River Quoile, and though the spans are newly fabricated, the concrete centre pier is original.

=== Carriage Gallery ===
Completed in 2012, the Carriage Gallery is the DCDR&#x27;s museum with rolling stock that is not being used to run public trains during their visit. Like the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, the Carriage Gallery houses vehicles in an indoors environment where the public can get up close and learn about both the vehicles in question, and Irish railways in general. Despite its name, the Carriage Gallery also contains locomotives, both steam and diesel, and even a road-going tar boiler. Designed in homage to the Victorian railway termini with their grand overall roofs, the Gallery collection is arranged across 3 roads with 4 platform faces, allowing visitors the chance to enter the vehicles. The condition of the exhibits ranges from fully restored to as-discovered so that visitors can appreciate the huge work required, with some carriages still in the hen-house state they were found in on farms across the country.

The Carriage Gallery was officially opened by the Earl Of Wessex in 2014.

==Rolling Stock==

=== Overview ===
The railway hosts three steam locomotives, eight diesel locomotives, seven diesel railcar sets, twenty-four carriages, thirty-eight wagons and four permanent way vehicles, making for a total of eighty-three railway vehicles. If the railcar constituent coaches are considered as individual carriages, the total is ninety vehicles.

==== Engines ====
At present O&amp;K Nos. 1 and 3 are the operational steam locomotives. 1875-built 0-6-0 tank engine, GSWR No.90, delivered to Downpatrick on Sunday 30 September 2007, is Ireland&#x27;s oldest steam engine capable of operation. Two E Class diesels, Nos. E421 and E432, were acquired in 1986, with E421 working the Society&#x27;s first passenger trains. However, the E Class could not start from cold and thus three G Class diesels arrived at the railway to facilitate shunting and works trains - one was purchased privately by a volunteer from Westrail, and two are on long-term loan from the Irish Traction Group (ITG). The ITG also loans three mainline diesels to the railway - CIÉ A class No.A39R (arrived 22 November 2009), 141 class No. 146 (arrived 27 November 2010) and 201 Class No. C231. (arrived 7 June 2014).

==== Railcars ====
Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway Railcar B, built in 1947, was donated to the railway by Iarnród Éireann in 2006. This railcar arrived in poor condition and it will be some time before the DCDR can return it to operational condition. Prototype BR-Leyland railbus, RB3, which was modified in the early 1980s to run on Irish metals and was used for a period by Northern Ireland Railways, was acquired by DCDR in 2001, with the hope of using it to run midweek trains as it did not require as large a crew as locomotive-hauled trains. However, due to several faults inherent with the prototype Railbus&#x27; design, this did not come to fruition. Three more ex-NIR railcars are owned by DCDR, comprising the last 450 Class, 458 &quot;Antrim Castle&quot;, which arrived in 2014 and has been converted to a buffet train, and two 80 class railcars which arrived in 2018.

==== Carriages ====
There are four main &#x27;carriage rakes&#x27;. These are:

* Old Buffet: Conventional 1950s carriages formerly used as the buffet train and Santa&#x27;s Grotto during the Autumn and Winter months. Shown in pink on the tables below.
* New Buffet: A 450 Class railcar and DBSO used as the buffet train during the Spring and Summer months. Shown in blue on the tables below.
* Everyday Running Set: 1950s carriages used during most running days. Shown in green on the tables below.
* Vintage Running Set: Antique carriages (Edwardian period or earlier) normally on display in the Carriage Gallery, but brought into service for special events. Shown in brown on the table below.

The everyday running set currently consists of CIÉ 1944 and UTA 728, with generator van CIÉ 3223 being added for Autumn/Winter operations to provide heat and light. On special days, the Vintage Set is used, consisting of BCDR Nos. 72 and 148, and GSWR 836. 836 is also sometimes added to the everyday running set on very busy days, creating a high-capacity rake along with 1944 and 728 capable of seating over 200 people. The buffet set is publicly accessible on running days when it is parked in a platform (the New Buffet at Inch Abbey during Spring and Summer, and the Old Buffet at the Loop Platform in Autumn and Winter).

The remainder of the carriage fleet is considerably varied, with a mix of six- and four-wheeled and bogie carriages, and representatives from virtually every time period and Irish gauge railway company - including the BCDR (The DCDR owns 5 of the 6 extant BCDR carriages), GNR, GSWR, GSR, UTA, NIR, CIÉ, and most significantly, the Ulster Railway, which is represented by No. 33, the sole surviving UR vehicle and Ulster&#x27;s oldest carriage. Other notable carriages are BCDR Railmotor No. 72 and Royal Saloon No. 153, both of Ireland&#x27;s extant Travelling Post Offices and the last AEC railcar. Two carriages, GSWR No.&#x27;s 1097 and 1287, arrived at the railway in the mid-2000s on loan from RPSI, though ownership was later transferred to DCDR.

==== Wagons ====
The DCDR also has a large selection of wagons, goods vans and underframes. Ex-NCC brake van No. 33 was the railway&#x27;s first passenger-carrying vehicle. Included in the railway&#x27;s wagon fleet is the most powerful steam crane in Ireland, NCC No. 3084. As the wagons do not contribute to bringing in revenue like engines and carriages, most are in storage except for a small few in use by the railway&#x27;s Permanent Way or Locomotive Departments. In time, DCDR hopes to construct a dedicated goods shed in order to finally give its wagons a permanent home. In August 2022, a complete ballast train composed of three hoppers and a plough van were delivered to the railway from North Wall, Dublin across two days, supported by Iarnród Éireann.

A small fleet of permanent way vehicles, all acquired from NIR, and some road/rail on-track plant are used by the railway&#x27;s Permanent Way department.

<text>Colin Murray &quot;Gem&quot; Archer ( &quot;&quot;; born 7 December 1966.) is an English guitarist and singer. He is best known as a member of the rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds, making him, alongside Chris Sharrock, one of the only members of Oasis to have been part of both Liam and Noel Gallagher&#x27;s post-Oasis projects. He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo.

Archer joined Oasis as second lead guitarist in November 1999, and contributed to the writing of some of the band&#x27;s songs. Oasis went on a 15-year hiatus in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other Oasis members excluding his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye. After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Different Gear, Still Speeding&quot; and 2013&#x27;s &quot;BE&quot;, the band had officially disbanded in October 2014. In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with Oasis member Noel Gallagher.

==Career==
=== The Edge and the Contenders ===
Archer began his musical career in a group called the Edge in the early 1981. They released two singles, &quot;Take a Walk&quot; and &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;. In early 1987, he was part of a band called the Contenders. He then formed Whirlpool in 1991 and signed to Food Records and EMI Publishing. Simon Scott was also involved on a live basis playing keyboards and back-up vocals. After gigging around the UK and recording for 18 months the group folded. This laid the foundations for Heavy Stereo, with Gem taking over the role of singer.

=== Heavy Stereo ===
Archer formed Heavy Stereo with bassist Nez and guitarist Pete Downing both previously of Redcar indie band 2 Lost Sons who were subsequently signed with Creation Records. The band&#x27;s only album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Déjà Voodoo&quot;, did not enjoy much critical or commercial success. However, Heavy Stereo&#x27;s next release did receive more attention through demos of new material, a critically acclaimed contribution to The Jam tribute album, &quot;Fire and Skill: The Songs of the Jam,&quot; and opening on a Paul Weller tour.

=== Oasis ===
Archer heard a report on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; that Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs had left Oasis after a massive row with Noel Gallagher. He claims, &quot;I thought, Shit! They&#x27;ll split now. I was a real fan, and I&#x27;m not just saying that. For me, Oasis had breathed life back into rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; He was unaware that Noel Gallagher – who knew Archer from both their days on the Creation Records label – had rung his home in London and invited him to Olympic Studios, where Oasis were mixing &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;. &quot;We went to the pub and I couldn&#x27;t stand not knowing if I was a part of the band. After less than half a pint of Guinness I said, &#x27;What does Liam say?&#x27; And Noel said, &#x27;It&#x27;s my f*cking band. I&#x27;ll have who I want.&#x27;&quot; Archer claims the rest of Heavy Stereo were pleased for him to join Oasis.

Since Archer did not perform on the &quot;Giants&quot; album, he received no royalties and, for the first few performances, was paid a standard session wage, about £85 a gig, as the new Oasis rhythm guitarist. His first official duty was to appear on the &quot;Go Let It Out&quot; video – on which he played lead guitar, as Andy Bell had yet to take over bass, so Noel played bass with Liam on acoustic guitar and vocals. Archer played his first rhythm guitar set at a session for alternative radio in Philadelphia.

Though Archer was officially referred to as Oasis&#x27; rhythm guitarist, his role in Oasis was much more than that. In live settings, he and Noel often switched between lead and rhythm guitar and both Noel and Liam Gallagher have praised Archer for his contributions in the studio. Archer also had a role as a songwriter. His first songwriting contribution after joining Oasis was &quot;Hung in a Bad Place&quot;, which appeared on Oasis&#x27; fifth album &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;. This song was picked up for use in a commercial for Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the US. His role was expanded on Oasis&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth&quot;, which features Archer&#x27;s &quot;A Bell Will Ring&quot; and &quot;Love Like a Bomb&quot;, the latter of which he co-wrote with singer Liam Gallagher. He also contributed the B-sides &quot;Eyeball Tickler&quot; and &quot;The Quiet Ones&quot; – an acoustic song. He also wrote &quot;To Be Where There&#x27;s Life&quot; on the 2008 album &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;. Archer has said that he found it quite daunting to submit songs for consideration to the band because of Noel Gallagher&#x27;s stature as a songwriter, whom he cites as one of his favourite songwriters. Archer, in rare occasions, contributed backing vocals to Oasis songs, such as on &quot;The Meaning of Soul&quot;, &quot;Force of Nature&quot;, and on the band&#x27;s cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot;, played piano on &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Mucky Fingers&quot;.

=== Beady Eye ===

Noel Gallagher quit Oasis in August 2009, following an argument with his brother in Paris. Gallagher placed part of the blame for his decision to leave on Archer, and Andy Bell, for a lack of support saying &quot;the lack of support and understanding from my... band mates has left me with no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new.&quot; Soon afterwards the band announced they had split. However, Archer, Bell, Liam Gallagher and Oasis live drummer Chris Sharrock resolved to work together on a new project under a new name, Beady Eye. While Noel Gallagher maintains a friendship with Archer, as well as Oasis drummer Chris Sharrock, he claims that he has not spoken with his brother Liam or former Oasis bassist Andy Bell.

Archer contributed guitar, bass and backing vocals to Beady Eye&#x27;s debut album &quot;Different Gear, Still Speeding&quot;, released on 28 February 2011.

Archer also contributed guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals on Beady Eye&#x27;s second album &quot;BE&quot;, released on 10 June 2013.

On 25 October 2014, Liam Gallagher announced, via Twitter, that Beady Eye had disbanded.

=== Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds ===
In December 2015, Archer appeared with Noel Gallagher at an acoustic gig in Lincoln on 6 December 2015, followed by an appearance for BBC Radio 2 the following night.

In October 2016, Gem joined Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds for their performance of &quot;Half the World Away&quot; dedicated to Caroline Aherne for Channel 4&#x27;s Stand Up to Cancer telethon; leading to speculation he had become a permanent member of the band.

In July 2017, it was confirmed that Gem had become a permanent member of Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds.

=== Other work ===
Outside of Oasis, Archer has collaborated with a few other artists, most notably Paul Weller. He has contributed acoustic guitar to the song &#x27;One x One&#x27; on Weller&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Illumination&quot; and guitars and mellotron to the song &#x27;Echoes Round The Sun on Weller&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;22 Dreams&quot;. He participated in an acoustic tour of the US with Weller when Steve Cradock of Ocean Colour Scene was unavailable, and provided guitar and backing vocals at the 2010 NME Awards when Weller performed a live set having received the &#x27;Godlike Genius Award&#x27;.

He also contributed guitar to David Holmes&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Killed&quot;.

He also assisted Noel Gallagher in producing the first Proud Mary album, a band signed to Gallagher&#x27;s Sour Mash record label.

According to album notes, Gem also worked with his good friend and previous Oasis and Beady Eye colleague Andy Bell on his debut solo album (not under the “Glok” alias) called “The View from Halfway Down”, contributing some drums, bass and guitar tracks, and also providing some of the recording work.

==Personal life==
On 1 August 2013, Archer was admitted to hospital with serious head trauma and a fractured skull after a freak accident at home, by falling down a flight of stairs. After several scans, to ensure that there was no long-term effects, Beady Eye&#x27;s V-Festival act was cancelled, so that he could be kept under observation. He was later said to be in a stable condition.
He loves dutch food. 

On 26 November 2022, Archer married Christine Mary Biller in London.

<text>Peace River (originally named Peace River Crossing and known as  in French) is a town in northwest Alberta, Canada. It is along the banks of the Peace River at its confluence with the Smoky River, the Heart River and Pat&#x27;s Creek. It is approximately northwest of Edmonton and northeast of Grande Prairie on Highway 2. It was known as the Village of Peace River Crossing between 1914 and 1916.

The Peace River townsite is nearly below the relatively flat terrain surrounding it. Pat&#x27;s Creek used to be an open channel through the town but is now channelled through a culvert under the town streets, re-emerging at the mouth on the Peace River at the Riverfront Park.

The population in the Town of Peace River was 6,729 in 2011, a 6.6% increase over its 2006 population. There are significant nodal settlements and subdivisions in the vicinity of the town on acreages along Highway 2 to the west, Highways 684 (Shaftesbury Trail) and 743 as well as the southwest portion of Northern Sunrise County. Regionally, there are various First Nation communities to the northeast, French-Canadian farming communities to the south and to the east, and Mennonite and Hutterite German-Canadian farming communities to the north and northwest of the town.

Peace River was the site of the 2004 Alberta Winter Games. In 2010, Peace River, in conjunction with Grimshaw and surrounding municipalities, jointly hosted the 2010 Alberta Summer Games.

== History ==
After the last glacial ice sheets melted from the northern parts of the Canadian prairies, an ice-free corridor allowed people from Asia to make a way deep into the Americas. When the Ice Age ended, many of these groups moved back north following the large herds of grazing animals which were, in turn, following the grasses northward in the warming climate. In the Peace River area, the two major language groups were the Athapaskan and the Algonquian.

In 1670, following the arrival of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Eastern Canada, guns began making their way westward as trade goods and the Algonquian speaking Cree began pushing the Athapaskan speakers Dunne-za or Beaver further west. The Beaver in turn pushed the Sekani deep into the Rocky Mountain Trench in the mid-18th century. A truce was eventually agreed to by the Cree and the Beaver and the great river they called Unchagah (the Peace River) became the boundary between their hunting territories.

The North West Company pushed westward in the late 18th century in an attempt to reach the Pacific Ocean, creating rivalry with the other major fur-trading company, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

=== Historical sites and architecture ===

The Northern Alberta Railway (NAR) station was built in 1916 by the Central Canada Railway. It served as a major hub of activity from 1916 to 1956 for passengers. The station was continued for use for freight and the station was closed in 1981. The NAR station suffered a fire in 1986. It was restored back to its former state in 1991, costing nearly $300,000 to complete. It currently houses the Tourist Information Centre in Peace River. It is located on 94 Avenue block of 100 Street next to the railway tracks that cross through Peace River.

The NAR station was used again as a railway station for first time in about 30 years by passengers when the Alberta Prairie Steam Tours, owners of the passenger cars, sent eight coaches to Peace River in September 2006, thereby enabling riders to travel like the pioneers of the area did in the 1920s. It involved short trips to DMI, a pulp mill 20 kilometres north of the Town of Peace River, and to Grimshaw. The train ride also included on-board entertainment.
The Catholic St. Augustine Mission located along Shaftesbury Trail on River Lot 22 was established in 1888 when the missionaries first came to the Peace country to evangelize and educate the First Nations people. Alongside the mission is an old cemetery. This site is located within the Peace River Provincial Correctional Centre which was built in 1968.

Third Mission Heritage Suites located at 100 Avenue block of 98 Street adjacent to Riverfront Park and across from the original Hudson&#x27;s Bay Factor&#x27;s House (1904). was formerly the priests’ house that was moved by CAT over the ice to Peace River in 1958 and functioned as residential apartments before being renovated into a hotel suite.

Anglican Mission Site was established on River Lot 11 on Shaftesbury Trail in 1886, all that remains now is a small cemetery.

The St. James Anglican Cathedral Church was built in 1936. The parish also erected Athabasca Hall around the same time adjacent to it. With the Athabasca Hall being the largest facility in town at that time, the hall bookings became too much for the parish decided to lease it to the Peace River Recreation Board in 1972 for 20 years. In 1979, the parish&#x27;s first dean emeritus sold it to the Town of Peace River and used the proceeds to add a new church hall connected to the cathedral.
The McNamara Hotel was built in 1921 by Martin Joseph McNamara. It has burnt down twice in the past; once in 1926 and 1993, and rebuilt both times.

Fort Fork site, located in the Peace River Wildland Provincial Park is a national historic site. The fort was erected in 1792 by the North West Company. Alexander Mackenzie wintered at Fort Fork in 1792 as did David Thompson in 1802. The fort was abandoned in 1805 and has since been almost completed eroded by the Peace River. A flag planted at Fort Fork&#x27;s former site is all that remains. Mackenzie Cairn was erected on River Lot 19 in the Municipal District (M.D.) of Peace No. 135 in 1929 to commemorate Fort Fork.
A wooden statue stands at the Riverfront Park in Peace River to commemorate Henry Fuller Davis, one of the most famous figures in the Town of Peace River&#x27;s history. His “Twelve-Foot Davis” nickname stems from the 12-foot land claim during the Cariboo Country gold rush in British Columbia which netted him almost $30,000 worth of gold. He took these profits and staked it all on a trading post close to where the Town of Peace River stands today. It is for this reason that the Town of Peace River is sometimes referred to as the Land of Twelve-Foot Davis. Twelve-Foot Davis&#x27; gravesite is designated a park and is located on the top of Grouard Hill just east of the town.

Dr. Greene Cairn located in Greene Valley Provincial Park is a historical fixture that remembers Dr. William Greene for his contributions to the community and to the organizations to which he belonged to. Born and raised in San Francisco, Dr. Greene was a medical doctor and dentist in addition to being among first eight men to fly, according to a 1910 edition of New York Sun.

== Geography ==

Physiographically, the Town of Peace River lies within the Peace River Formation, a stratigraphical unit of middle Albian age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. The area developed on sediments of the former lake bottom of Glacial Lake Peace, which covered most of the areas in the region that were below 610 m in elevation.

The specific landform in which the town is situated is the Peace River Lowland which was incised by the Peace River and its tributaries right through the area&#x27;s former glacial lake sediments and into the Cretaceous bedrock. The Peace River Lowlands is flanked by the Buffalo Head Hills to the east and the Whitemud and Clear Hills to the west.
The general area is categorized ecologically as aspen parkland with mixedwood stands understory. There is a variety of wetland habitats in the area with several being quite marshy with shallow water, soft bottoms, and abundant aquatic vegetation. Some of the lakes and sloughs are used by various waterfowls, both migrating and resident, for nesting. The parkland also supports a host of terrestrial and aquatic animals. It is also Canada&#x27;s most northerly agricultural region.

The Greene Valley Provincial Park lies just east of the town in the Northern Sunrise County and the Peace River Wildland Provincial Park is to the south on the east bank of the Peace River. These parks and the rest of the river valley, including some river islands, provide habitat for wildlife such as moose, deer, bear, coyotes, bats, reptiles, birds and numerous fish species. Maintaining natural areas in the river valley and limiting use to suitable recreational use has minimized impacts to wildlife habitat.

Historically, the town has been the subject of flooding. However, the town has developed a continuous dike system to prevent flood damage from to 1:100 year flood events and protect against ice-jam floods. As a result, the risk of flooding has been significantly reduced and no longer poses the same threat to the town.

On 30 November 2022, starting at 16:55 local time, a series of seismic events occurred to the southeast of Peace River. At 17:55, a 5.59-magnitude earthquake at an approximate depth of struck the area. Researchers at Stanford University later said the seismic event was likely to have been caused by human activities linked to the local gas-and-oil extraction industry. No damage or injuries were reported. On 16 March 2023, three slightly smaller tremors occurred less than away from the site of the original event.

=== Climate ===

The Peace River area is generally characterized by a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with low year-round precipitation. Its dry climate results in reduced humidity throughout the year.

Moisture coming with Pacific Ocean air is lost over the mountain ranges as precipitation before moving into the area, while air from the Arctic flows uninterrupted into the region. Due to cold air drainage, the river valley is often completely filled with stratus and fog while outside the valley is clear. The fog usually clears in a few hours. Winds in town are channeled along the Peace River valley (towards the northeast or southwest) while winds outside the valley are quite variable. During both summer and winter, the wind patterns outside the valley are mostly from the southwest or north. The passage of a migratory low to the north of Peace River will cause southwest winds to shift around to the north.

Winters are often cold enough to see the formation of an ice cover on the Peace River from January to late March or early April. The ice cover is composed of juxtaposed frazil ice pans and break-away border ice pieces that consolidate in the river flow direction. This produces a very jagged surface. The formation of ice cover results in a gradual increase in river water levels in town and is monitored by both Alberta Environment and BC Hydro. BC Hydro operates two hydroelectric dams on the Peace River in British Columbia: the W. A. C. Bennett Dam and Peace Canyon Dam. These dams have significant effect on the Peace River&#x27;s water levels.

Summer frequently features thunderstorms that are preceded with persistent winds and occasionally produce small grain-sized hail. Tornadoes and severe winds are a rarity in the Peace River area, although it is suspected that Grimshaw, a town 20 kilometres to the west, was struck by a tornado on 30 June 2003.

Due to Peace River&#x27;s northerly latitude, the summer solstice on 21 June brings 17 hours and 41 minutes of daylight. This turns around in when the area sees less than seven hours of daylight during the winter solstice on 21 December. Regardless of the season, when there is daylight out, Peace River will usually have sunny skies. There is on average 2,060 hours of sunshine every year.

An exposed field will have a different microclimate than sheltered locations. The temperature in the Peace River valley has been observed to be up to 5 °C warmer than that of the prairie land surrounding it. The unique micro-climate tends to help vegetables thrive in the Peace River valley.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Peace River was on 4 July 1926. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 January 1911.

===Contemporary issues===

==== Urban planning ====

The Town of Peace River is bounded by the M.D. of Peace No. 135 to the west and southwest, Northern Sunrise County to the east, the County of Northern Lights to the north and Birch Hills County further south at the confluence of the Peace and Smoky Rivers. In recognizing the need to plan for the growth of the Town of Peace River, the M.D. of Peace No. 135, Northern Sunrise County and the County of Northern Lights participated in the Peace River Inter-Municipal Development Plan (IDP) in July 1999. Through the adoption of the Peace River IDP, the four municipalities confirmed their commitment to cooperate and work together for the purpose of realizing the opportunities associated with the future growth of the Peace River area. The IDP addresses the future land use planning of the Peace River area, as well as other matters related to the physical, social and economic development of the region. The four municipalities are in the process of updating the IDP. In preparation for this, the municipalities also reviewed and updated their respective municipal development plans. While Northern Sunrise County established a serviced industrial area, the Sunrise Gateway Business Park on its own on the eastern boundary of the town, the M.D of Peace and County of Northern Lights included in their municipal development plans areas of joint development planning with the Town of Peace River on lands abutting the town to the north and to the west. The joint development planning was a partnership agreement to share the costs of servicing the lands and then jointly collecting taxes instead of the town annexing these lands. This was in response to the town&#x27;s growing need for commercial and industrial land, and also part of its long-term plan to have industrial establishments on the scenic banks of the Peace River cede the riverfront to future residential development while gradually relocating to industrial parks now to be located away from the river bank.

With a land area of , the population density in the Town of Peace River averages compared to Grimshaw&#x27;s and Manning&#x27;s . The lower population density of Town of Peace River relative to surrounding communities is attributable, in part to the rugged terrain in the river valley. The town&#x27;s 2010 Municipal Development Plan indicates that of the land base or 58.3% of the town&#x27;s total land area is developable and has actually been developed. The density based on developed land is . The existing land base just meets the 30 year requirement of residential development based on the 2006 Peace River Growth study that projected the population growing to 28,200 citizens. If future residential development occurs at higher than current densities and in more land-efficient manner, the town&#x27;s existing residential land supply should last even longer. Citadel Park Area Structure Plan for example is on a parcel of land with a projection to accommodate 1600 persons, for a density of . Due to the topographic constraints of the valley as well as the need to protect the natural areas and agricultural lands, the town is committed to optimize the existing developable land base as indicated in the 2010 Municipal Development Plan. Not only does higher density development lead to efficient use of available land and of existing infrastructure, but it also supports public transit.

==== Downtown revitalization ====

In 2009, the town engaged Avi Friedman, an architect and professor at McGill School of Architecture on an ambitious downtown revitalization and tourism development master plan. It can be found at the town&#x27;s website. The highlights of his design recommendations were:
*Redevelopment of the Riverfront District to include a marina, an upgraded Riverfront Park with lights and paving as well as high density residential development.
*Opening the south end of Main Street to the Heart River with a ramp up the earthen dyke and landscaping as well as the addition of an open air public art gallery to act as a counterpoint to the traffic circle on the north end of it.
*Opening up the west end of 96 Avenue to the river with terraced ramps and landscaping. A commercial/light industrial entity currently occupies parcel of land at the west end of 96 Ave.
*Creation of a heritage and welcoming park north of 100 Street between 94 Avenue and 96 Avenue adjacent to the Tourist Information Centre run by the Peace River &amp; District Chamber of Commerce. Currently Linc Park occupies a small portion of these lands and is connected to Pat&#x27;s Creek Trail and Friendship Trail.
*Densification of Main Street and the downtown in general with a minimum of 3 storey buildings as well as aesthetic additions to Main Street like large-scale awnings and street furniture.
*Upgrading the Twelve Foot Davis (baseball) Ball Park into a festival square equipped with better sitting and a stage. The baseball diamond currently hosts PeaceFest and Peace River Pow Wow. Peace River Aboriginal Inter-agency Committee made a formal request in June 2008 to erect a dance arbour for hosting traditional Aboriginal events.

==== Neighbourhoods ====

The Town of Peace River has various distinct neighbourhoods separated by geographic features of the area. The Downtown core is the civic business, administrative, social services and cultural centre of the town. It is split vaguely into three districts - the Commercial District, a Mixed Commercial/Residential District, and a Riverfront District.

The Commercial District is centred on the intersection of Main Street (100 Street), which forms part of Highway 744, and 100 Avenue. It spans from a block on either side of Main Street and along 100 Avenue. The Commercial District consists mostly of government, professional and commercial offices, financial institution, restaurants, cafés, retail stores and hotels.

The Riverfront District borders the Peace River and River Road between 94 Avenue to the north and 102 Avenue to the south adjacent to the Heart River bridge. It is home to restaurants, an enclosed shopping mall, an arts performance hall, a mini-golf facility, hotels, a museum, a convention centre, apartments, parks, trails and a boat launch.

The Mixed Commercial/Residential District makes the rest of the Downtown and consists of a mixture of low density and high density housing, government offices, professional and commercial offices, recreational facilities, hotels, bars, retail stores and restaurants.

Outside of Downtown core, the South End is the oldest neighbourhood in the town. It is located immediately south of the Downtown core, across the Heart River bridge, and west of Judah Hill. It is developed in a long and somewhat linear form parallel to the Peace River. The South End consists of mostly older single detached homes, a relatively small number of duplexes and apartments and various seniors&#x27; residences including a large seniors&#x27; apartment lodge immediately across the Heart River bridge on 103 Avenue, which is managed by the North Peace Housing Foundation. The South End stretches a far as 118 Avenue block after which the bank slopes become too unstable and has resulted in slides in past.

The North End is located north of the Highway 2 and west of Kaufman Hill, and is also developed in a linear form parallel to the Peace River. The North End is actually two neighbourhoods: Springfield and Norglen, which are seamlessly connected. The town&#x27;s schools and most of its recreational facilities are located in the North End. In addition to single detached housing, the North End consists of the majority of the town&#x27;s high density housing. The North End has a boat launch. Bewley Island, a sizable Crown owned island on the Peace River is also located on the North End of town.

West Peace lies southeast of the old Highway 2 alignment on the west shore of the Peace River. It includes two sub-neighbourhoods - Upper and Lower West Peace - that are divided by Shaftesbury Trail (Highway 684). Upper West Peace is on the west side of Highway 684 to the foot of the Misery Mountain Ski Hill. Lower West Peace is on the east side of Highway 684 and abuts Sisson Island, an 83 Acre privately owned island on the Peace River. Both Upper and Lower West Peace are predominantly developed with low density housing with some interspersed medium-density housing. Lower West Peace features a boat launch.

The Pines neighbourhood is located north of Upper and Lower West Peace, generally between the old and current Highway 2 alignments and more specifically across 100 Avenue from the Lions Camp Site. It was named for the numerous pine trees that grew in the area. The pine trees have since been chopped down after being ravaged by pine beetles. The Pines is single detached housing neighbourhood.

Rosedale is located to the south of Lower West Peace between Highway 684 and the Peace River. It consists of single detached housing with relatively larger lots on un-paved roads.

Shaftesbury Estates is further south of Rosedale separated by a short strip of undeveloped land and St. Germaine Creek along Highway 684 and abutting the Peace River. It is the town&#x27;s most rapidly growing neighbourhood and consists of single detached housing.

Saddleback Ridge, or Saddleback, is atop the West Hill immediately behind Misery Mountain and south of Highway 2 behind an industrial area. Rolling Hills neighbourhood is often considered to be part of Saddleback, although it is separate neighbourhood of single detached housing with some duplexes and row housing. Saddleback consists mostly of single detached housing, and after a bylaw amendment allowed medium density housing and not high density residential.
Westbrook Estates is approximately 1 kilometre south of Saddleback, west of 80 Street separated by a stretch of undeveloped wilderness with trails through which St. Germain Creek and one of its tributaries cut while flowing to the Peace River. It is flanked by Misery Mountain to the east and Brick Hill on the west side. It consists single detached housing on acreages and lacking in town sewer and potable piped water services.

West Hill Commercial District extends from 80 Street to 73 Street on either side of Highway 2. The District encompasses Freson Centre which is home to most of the big-box stores in Peace River, a veterinary clinic, hotels, coffee shops, fast food restaurants, car and holiday trailers dealerships and the Northern Lakes College Peace River Campus. The Peace River Community Health Centre is also located in the District, on 68 Street and south of Highway 2.

Area structure plans containing new residential neighbourhoods were adopted in 2009 and 2010, including St. Germaine Creek on a recently annexed land northwest of the intersection of Highway 2 and Highway 743, and Citadel Park on land west of Highway 684 between the Pines and Upper West Peace. Future residential development is also planned in Westview on the lands adjacent to the Peace River Community Health Centre.

== Economy ==
While the Government of Alberta is the largest employer in the town, with over 15 government departments located within its municipal boundaries, it is followed in close second by resource extraction, principally forestry, agriculture, oil and gas and their support services. Over the years, Peace River&#x27;s economy has expanded to include professional services, manufacturing, health/social services and construction. 

The Town of Peace River sits in the proximity of Peace River Oil Sands, Alberta&#x27;s 3rd largest oil sands deposit. In May 2010, Penn West Energy Trust signed a $1.25-billion deal with China Investment Corporation to finance operations in the Peace River oil sands area in anticipation of significantly ramping up its production. As part of the deal, $817 million took 45% stake in the oil sands operations and $435 million took 5% equity stake in the trust itself. In January 2010, Shell submitted a regulatory application for an 80,000 barrel-per-day expansion.

The Peace River is the largest river in Alberta and yet has the least water allocation licenses. Only 0.2% of provincial water allocations and only 0.3% or 9.1 million cubic metres of all estimated water use in the province are in the Lower Peace Region, implying that less than 1% of the average annual flow is allocated or used. It is for this reason that large energy projects are being considered in the region. In March 2008, Bruce Power made an application with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to build a 4 GW nuclear power plant in the area 30 kilometres west of the Town of Peace River around Lac Cardinal. After a detailed review of that site and other potential sites, Bruce Power Alberta, a subsidiary of Bruce Power announced that it has selected a different site approximately 30 kilometres north of the Town of Peace River. As of 12 December 2011 Bruce Power announced that it would no longer proceed with a nuclear power option in Alberta stating that: “We’ve decided the new nuclear option in Alberta is not something our company will be progressing further.”

By comparison, in the same year of 2007 the provincial rate was 165 police officers per capita and the national rate was 195. Between May 2007 and May 2008 the number of &quot;Criminal Code&quot; crimes that were recorded by the Peace Regional RCMP Detachment was 232 while between May 2008 and May 2009 the number was 231. In the May 2008 report, 140 were in the Town of Peace River while in the May 2009 was 134. These figures project to an average of 2169 crimes per 100,000 in the Town of Peace River and 1540 crimes per 100,000 in the entire region including Grimshaw, whose population exceeded 15,000 persons in 2006. This is compared to just below 10,000 crimes per 100,000 persons in Alberta and 7,000 crimes per 100,000 persons nationally.

Perhaps the most violent crimes in the area has seen in recent times is the swarming assault of two RCMP officers in Cadotte Lake, a hamlet about 90 kilometres northeast of Peace River in March 2010. With back-up from RCMP in Peace River, Red Earth Creek and High Prairie, the offenders were apprehended and charged.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The Town of Peace River is located on Highway 2 to southern Alberta and near Highways 35 to Northwest Territories, and Highway 43 to British Columbia and Alaska thereby making it an important ground link to these destinations. These highways also provide access to the rich oil and gas fields and forests.

What was formerly the Northern Alberta Railway tracks through the town provide the only rail crossing over the Peace River in Alberta. The Canadian government built the Great Slave Lake Railway which started at Roma, a few kilometres west of the Town of Peace River on the Northern Alberta Railways and ran north to the southern shores of Great Slave Lake at Hay River, Northwest Territories. It is Canada&#x27;s most northern railroad. The federal government&#x27;s intent was to ease shipment of lead-zinc ore from the Pine Point Mines southwest of the lake. Currently Canadian National Railway owns and operates the line.

====Road network====
The road system in Peace River is on a grid where roads are numbered with avenues run east to west and streets run north to south. Postfix letter &quot;A&quot; is added to the name numbers of street that do not conform to the grid, lying between two streets that conform. With 100 Avenue and 100 Street located in the downtown core, the avenue numbers increase southwards and street numbers decrease eastwards. Some roads still bear the historical street names assigned in the pioneering days, in addition to the modern road numbering nomenclature, especially in the downtown area.

====Airport====

The town owns and manages a municipal airport, the Peace River Airport located 5 kilometre west on Highway 2. Northern Air has regular flights from it to and from Edmonton International Airport Monday through Friday. They also charter flights from Peace River Airport as well as air ambulance. Peace Air once headquartered at the airport ceased operations in 2007.

The Peace River Airport Steering Committee has been set up to assess viability and regionalization potential the airport. The committee has representatives from the Town of Peace River, Northern Sunrise County, M.D. of Peace No. 135, County of Northern Lights and the Town of Grimshaw, and is working on a business plan.

====Public transit====
The town&#x27;s Community Services Department managed the Peace River Transit, a small bus network operated by the Bus Company. The 2006 Census indicated that 1.4% of people in the Peace River used public transit to go to work, while 7.3% chose to walk or bike to work (the provincial averages are 9.2% and 7.1% respectively). According to the Peace River Transit Pilot Project Survey, 38% of the lower income earners used Peace River Transit. Statistics from Community Services Department indicated that the ridership had been on a steady climb since its inception in 2005. By June 2010, the number of rides provided for that month was almost 80% of the total rides provided in the entire year of 2005. Because the transit buses were not wheelchair accessible, special taxi passes were also made available at a discounted rate to seniors, mentally/physically challenged persons, low income individuals/families and students at Northern Lakes College through the Community Services Department. Peace River&#x27;s transit system was discontinued in early 2011, due in part to high operating costs. However, the taxi pass program is still available to eligible individuals.

Among the bigger challenges facing the town (and other small towns) with respect to mass transit is the low overall population density and dispersed development that results in a pattern of travel that is less focused on the downtown and hence more difficult to serve by transit. Studies show that for every 1% increase in residential density, there is a 0.22% rise in transit ridership. However, destination density, such as clustered employment locations, tend to have a larger impact on transit ridership than residential density alone.

=== Utilities ===
The Town of Peace River extracts water from the Peace River at the Shaftesbury Water Treatment Plant. The treatment process involves clarification, sedimentation, filtration, chlorination and fluoridation. The potable water is then pumped to the three reservoirs the town owns. Sanitary waste is piped to the wastewater treatment plant in the north end of town that involves secondary treatment and extended aeration. Residential garbage pickup is contracted out to Allen Bros. Trucking Ltd., a private company.

The Town of Peace River provides municipal sanitary sewer and treated potable water against a unique set of topographical and climatic conditions. There is a significant annual variation in temperature compounded by dramatic changes in elevation within town that leads to frequent leaks and breaks in water mains and sewer trunks. The dramatic changes in elevation also necessitate a large number of lift stations to pump both treated drinking water and sewage across large distances. When combined with the maintenance issues associated with the unstable soils, these factors lead to very high infrastructure costs for urban development within the valley.

===Health care===
The Peace River area is served by the Peace River Community Health Centre, which is a site for Rural Alberta North &amp; Rural Family Medical Training Program for University of Alberta. Other hospitals in the area include the Grimshaw/Berwyn Community Health Complex in Grimshaw, the Manning Community Health Centre in Manning and the Sacred Heart Community Health Centre in McLennan. Peace River Mental Health Clinic in downtown Peace River provides psychiatric care for patients in the region. When very specialized care is required, patients are often transferred to Edmonton via air ambulance. Initially these hospitals were run by the Peace Country Health Services. They are now administered by Alberta Health Services, the provincial health authority since a reorganization in 2008, that plans and delivers health services on behalf of the Ministry of Health.

Drop-in health needs are catered for at the Associate Medical Clinic in downtown Peace River. The clinic is working on plans for a new state-of-the-art medical clinic, Centre of Medical Excellence to be located adjacent to the Peace River Community Health Centre in West Hill. The over facility is intended to increase both the capacity and the efficiency of medical care in the region. Conceptual plans are located at Associate Medical Clinic website.

There is a handful of pharmacies, dental offices, chiropractic clinics and optometrists in town.

==Education==
Both public and separate schools are available within the Town of Peace River. The Peace River School Division operates eighteen public schools and two outreach campuses in the area. Peace River based schools are Springfield Elementary School, T.A. Norris Middle School, Peace River High School and Outreach Campus. The Holy Family Catholic Regional Division provides elementary to Grade 12 Catholic education programming Peace River schools: Good Shepherd School and Glenmary Catholic Junior/Senior High School. The Conseil scolaire du Nord-Ouest No. 1 is a francophone education region offering Catholic and Public education to Section 23 children. They operate École des Quatre-Vents, a public school in Peace River. Peace River Adventist Junior Academy is another separate school in town.

Post-secondary education is offered at Northern Lakes College Peace River Campus. The college has recently expanded the program selection to include trades training in carpentry, electrical, welding and crane and hoisting equipment operator. The Peace River Campus also hosts NAIT administered Boreal Research Institute, a partnership of the private sector, the education system, and the community.

Peace Adult Literacy runs a volunteer adult literacy program. They located in the Horizon Learning Centre in the new Horizon Credit Union Office on Main Street.

==Media==
The region is served by two weekly newspapers, the Peace River Record-Gazette and Mile Zero News. The Peace River Record-Gazette is based in Peace River while Mile Zero News is based in Grimshaw. Although the Record-Gazette reports mostly on the Town of Peace River, Nampa, St. Isidore and Northern Sunrise County and the Mile Zero News reports mostly on Grimshaw, the M.D. of Peace No. 135 and the County of Northern Lights, there is significant overlap in the news coverage by the two newspapers.

The Town of Peace River has two locally based radio stations: CKKX-FM (Kix FM) and CKYL-FM (River Country), both owned by Peace River Broadcasting. Other radio stations available in the area include CIAM-FM, CHFA-FM, CBX, CKUA and CFGP-FM.

<text>Natalino Otto, stage name of Natale Codognotto (24 December 1912 – 4 October 1969) was an Italian singer. He started the swing genre in Italy.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Natalino Otto was born at Cogoleto, province of Genoa, in northern Italy.

His career as a singer and musician started in the clubs of his native region, Liguria. During the 1930s he worked as an entertainer on board transatlantic liners on the routes between Europe and North America, which gave him the opportunity to get to know American music genres, especially jazz and swing.

In 1935, he was hired by an Italian-American radio station in New York. Back in Italy in 1937, Otto presented an innovative repertoire, strongly influenced by American music of that era. But he had to face Italian Fascist regime censorship, that banned anything foreign. He was forced to translate song titles and lyrics into Italian. The Italian state radio company EIAR did not broadcast his songs, and labelled them as &quot;barbaric negro antimusic&quot;.

Banned from the radio, Natalino Otto worked for recording companies instead, together with two great Italian bandleaders, Gorni Kramer and Pippo Barzizza. In a short while he won the audience with his records – one of the few Italian singers of those times, if not the only one, to achieve success without his songs playing on the radio. Italian people danced to his swing tunes, which earned him the nickname &quot;King of Rhythm&quot;.

=== Cinema and Sanremo Festival ===
Thanks to his popularity, also the movie industry wanted him. He was offered singer roles in a few films. He was the leading character in &quot;The Whole City Sings&quot; directed by Riccardo Freda in 1945. He also starred in &quot;La casa senza tempo&quot; and &quot;Carosello del varietà&quot;.

During the 1950s, Natalino Otto took part for five times to the Sanremo Music Festival. His best result was a third place in 1955 with a song titled &quot;Canto nella Valle&quot;. In that year he married Flo Sandon&#x27;s, also an Italian singer. They had a daughter Silvia born in 1956.

In the early 1960s, Otto retired from the public scene, but he continued to be involved in show organization, recordings and musical research.

He died in Milan in 1969.

==Overview==
Natalino Otto was a very prolific singer. He recorded over two thousand songs during his career. His greatest hits were &quot;Ho un sassolino nella scarpa&quot;, &quot;Mamma voglio anch&#x27;io la fidanzata&quot;, &quot;Mister Paganini&quot;, &quot;Polvere di stelle&quot;, &quot;Op op trotta cavallino&quot;, &quot;Natalino studia canto&quot;, &quot;Il valzer del boogie-woogie&quot;, &quot;La classe degli asini&quot;.

Natalino Otto and his wife Flo Sandon&#x27;s are credited with the discovery of one of Italy&#x27;s greatest singers of all times – Mina. On the night of 24 September 1958 the Happy Boys, a band of teen-age students was playing in the Rivaloro del Re dance hall, Cremona. Otto and his wife were present, and were greatly impressed by the singer of that group. They went to meet her at the end of the concert and proposed her a trial recording session. One month later, Mina&#x27;s first single was out.

<doc id="1084332" wikidata="Q353388" url="?curid=1084332" title="Andy Bell (Welsh musician)">
<text>Andrew Piran Bell (born 11 August 1970) is a Welsh musician. He is one of two vocalists and guitarists of the rock band Ride, and was formerly the bassist of Oasis from 1999 until their breakup in 2009. Bell was also a member of Hurricane #1 as well as Liam Gallagher&#x27;s post-Oasis project Beady Eye until their breakup in 2014.

With Ride, Bell helped pioneer shoegaze, an alternative rock subgenre which reached its peak popularity in the early 1990s. Bell also wrote one song or more on each of Oasis&#x27; final three albums.

== Career ==

===Ride===
Bell formed Ride with Mark Gardener (guitarist), whom he met at Cheney School in Oxford and Laurence Colbert (drummer) and Steve Queralt (bassist), whom he met doing Foundation Studies in Art and Design at Banbury in 1988. While still at Banbury the band produced a tape demo including the tracks &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; and &quot;Drive Blind&quot;. In February 1989, Ride were asked to stand in for a cancelled student union gig at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) that brought them to the attention of Alan McGee. After supporting The Soup Dragons in 1989 McGee then signed them to Creation Records which is a key event in Bell&#x27;s life.

With Ride, Bell released three EPs between January and September 1990, entitled &quot;Ride&quot;, &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Fall&quot;. While the EPs achieved a degree of chart success per release, enough critical praise was received to make Ride the darlings of music journalists. The first two EPs were eventually released together as &quot;Smile&quot; in 1992, while the &quot;Fall&quot; EP was later incorporated into CD releases of their debut LP, &quot;Nowhere&quot;, released in October 1990, which was hailed as a critical success, with the media dubbing Ride &quot;the brightest hope&quot; for 1991. On &quot;Nowhere&quot;, Bell contributed &quot;Seagull&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, &quot;In a Different Place&quot;, Polar Bear&quot;, &quot;Dreams Burn Down&quot;, &quot;Paralysed&quot;, and &quot;Vapour Trail&quot;.

There was a rumour in early 1991 that Robert Smith (The Cure) refused to appear in the Great British Music Weekend concert unless Ride were also in the list of acts playing. Ride did appear along with The Wedding Present, Carter USM and The Cure. &quot;Nowhere&quot; was followed in March 1992 with &quot;Going Blank Again&quot;. The twin rhythm guitars of Bell and Gardener, both distorted, both using wah-wah pedals and both feeding back on each other was seen as the highlight of the album&#x27;s critical and chart success. On &quot;Going Blank Again&quot;, Bell contributed &quot;Not Fazed&quot;, &quot;Chrome Waves&quot;, &quot;Time Of Her Time&quot;, &quot;Cool Your Boots&quot; and &quot;Making Judy Smile&quot;.

Despite having a solid fanbase and some mainstream success, the lack of a breakthrough contributed to intra-band tension, especially between Gardener and Bell. Their third LP, &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, was released in 1994, after shoegazing had given way to Britpop. On &quot;Carnival of Light&quot;, Bell contributed &quot;Birdman&quot;, &quot;Crown Of Creation&quot;, &quot;Endless Road&quot;, &quot;Magical Spring&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Where It Comes From&quot;. The band were joined at Creation Records by Oasis, who shot to fame in 1994 with their debut &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. As label mates, Bell was an early fan of the band and became friendly with the Gallagher brothers.

1995 saw the dissolution of the band while recording their fourth album, &quot;Tarantula&quot;, due to creative and personal tensions between the two guitarists. Bell penned several of the songs for the album, one of which – &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; – has been interpreted as a lament for the band&#x27;s situation. Additionally, Bell contributed &quot;Black Nite Crash&quot;, &quot;Sunshine / Nowhere To Run&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&quot;, &quot;Walk On Water&quot;, &quot;Mary Anne&quot;, &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;, &quot;Burnin&quot;, and &quot;Starlight Motel&quot;. Upon release of the album, it was announced that it would be deleted after one week.

Since the break-up, both Bell and Gardener have been more reflective on the reasons why the group disintegrated, with Bell especially admitting his own part in the process.

In 2014 it was announced that Ride had re-formed and tour for eight months throughout in Europe and North America in 2015. This took in two headline shows at Primavera Sound and London’s Field Day. November 2016 brought further news many Ride fans have been anticipating: there would be a new album in 2017. Producer and DJ Erol Alkan broke the news on Twitter that he had been in the studio with the band, with their first album in 20 years released in Summer 2017. &#x27;Weather Diaries&#x27;, Ride&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released on 16 June 2017 on Wichita Recordings.

In August 2019, Ride released their sixth studio album, &quot;This Is Not a Safe Place&quot;, which reached number 7 in the UK charts. The release has been supported with a world tour.. While performing supporting Noel Gallagher in Taunton, Somerset in August 2023, the band confirmed that work on its latest album had been completed, with a release date yet to be decided.

===Hurricane #1===
Bell returned in 1997 with Hurricane #1, another Creation signing. Inspired by Oasis, Bell had drafted in a more gutsy singer, Alex Lowe, who would sing the songs Bell wrote for him. The same year, they released their first album, also called &quot;Hurricane #1&quot;. Their first single, &quot;Step into My World&quot;, reached number 29 in the UK charts (a re-mix reached number 19 that year), and other less successful singles &quot;Just Another Illusion&quot; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Only the Strongest Will Survive&quot;, was released in 1998 and the title track was released as a single reaching number 19. Notably, this album contains the only Hurricane #1 song not written by Bell, &quot;What Do I Know?&quot;, which was written by Alex Lowe.

Hurricane #1 drew attention for their similarity to Oasis. Bell himself said &quot;Hurricane No. 1 is not so much influenced by Oasis, it&#x27;s inspired by Oasis&quot;. Their albums did not sell well in comparison to Ride. In 1999, it was reported in the music press that Bell would be touring as guitarist with the band Gay Dad. But this never happened because Bell had by that time been asked to join Oasis.

===Oasis===

During 1999 with Hurricane #1 on hiatus, Bell moved from Oxford to live with his wife and daughter in Sweden. Bell was invited to join Oasis because they were looking for replacements for founding members Paul Arthurs and Paul McGuigan. At the last minute Bell had to learn to play bass as well as the entire Oasis catalogue before his first Oasis gig.

While with Oasis, Bell regularly made songwriting contributions to the band. On &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;, Bell wrote the song &quot;A Quick Peep&quot;. His song &quot;Thank You For the Good Times&quot; was featured as the B-side of &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; from the same album. On &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe The Truth&quot;, he wrote &quot;Turn Up the Sun&quot; (which also opened every live show on that Oasis tour) and &quot;Keep the Dream Alive&quot;. On &quot;Dig Out Your Soul&quot;, he wrote &quot;The Nature of Reality&quot;.

===Beady Eye===
Noel Gallagher quit Oasis in August 2009, following an argument with his brother. Following the end of Oasis, Bell and the other former members formed Beady Eye. Bell changed from playing bass to guitar, his main instrument before joining Oasis, both live and in the studio for the band. Beady Eye&#x27;s debut album &quot;Different Gear, Still Speeding&quot; contains four songs written by Bell: &quot;Four Letter Word&quot;, &quot;Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Kill for a Dream&quot;, and &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;. Bell also contributed &quot;World Outside My Room&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Four Letter Word&quot;.

Bell played guitar and keyboards and provided backing vocals on Beady Eye&#x27;s second album, 2013&#x27;s &quot;BE&quot;. It contained three songs written by Bell: &quot;Face the Crowd&quot;, &quot;Soon Come Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m just Saying&quot;, and also co-wrote &quot;Flick of the Finger&quot;. He also contributed &quot;Dreaming of Some Space&quot; to the B-side of &quot;Second Bite of the Apple&quot;. Beady Eye disbanded in October 2014.

===Production work===
In addition to being a songwriter and musician, Bell has for a number of years actively been involved in record production. He receives co-production credit for both albums recorded by Hurricane #1, namely the eponymous &quot;Hurricane #1&quot; and &quot;Only The Strongest Will Survive&quot;.

During late 1995, after the sessions for &quot;Tarantula&quot; were completed but prior to the official announcement of Ride&#x27;s break-up, Bell undertook production duties on Britpop band The Kynd&#x27;s debut single &quot;Egotripper&quot;, which was released in October 1996.

Bell also undertook production duties for the fifth studio album &quot;Fear &amp; Love&quot; by Swedish band Weeping Willows, released in 2007. Weeping Willows draws upon early Roy Orbison and The Smiths as their main influences. On &quot;Fear &amp; Love&quot;, Bell brought some English folk music influences, and some 1960s styled British Invasion sounds. The album was more or less recorded live in the studio, by playing the songs until the band got them right with minimal digital post-production. Weeping Willows prior two albums relied on extensive post-production and remix styled studio techniques. Reaching number 2 in the Swedish charts, Scandinavian music critics have given &quot;Fear &amp; Love&quot; a warm welcome and compared some songs to The Coral, The Verve, Talk Talk and Oasis.

===Solo activities and projects===
Bell has been good friends with Magnus Carlson, the lead singer in Weeping Willows, and together they have embarked on some musical projects. Bell and Carlsson were resident DJs at Swedish club, Bangers &#x27;n&#x27; Mash during the mid-noughties. Bell also undertakes occasional DJ sets in UK clubs, for example, &quot;This Feeling&quot; nightclub in London. In 2003, Bell collaborated with the Stockholm based Irish-Swedish electronica/acid house duo, DK7, by providing guitar on the tracks &quot;Heart Like a Demon&quot; and &quot;White Shadow&quot; for their &quot;Disarmed&quot; album. During the autumn of 2006 Carlson and Bell teamed up with Janne Schaffer and performed at an event dedicated to the late 1970s singer-songwriter, Ted Gärdestad. In addition to his role as producer, Bell played a number of instruments on eight of the twelve tracks on the 2007 album &quot;Fear &amp; Love&quot; by Weeping Willows, ranging from glockenspiel and piano to guitar. He has also performed solo gigs at smaller Swedish summer festivals including the 2006 &#x27;Fest-i-val&#x27; in Umeå Sweden.

On May 10, 2007, Bell played the bass on &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; with Pink Floyd regulars David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and Jon Carin at The Madcap’s Last Laugh, a tribute concert to Pink Floyd&#x27;s recently deceased founding member, Syd Barrett, at Barbican Hall in London.

In July 2007, Bell appeared with friend and former fellow Ride member Mark Gardener onstage with Californian rock band The Brian Jonestown Massacre at the Oxford &quot;Truck&quot; Music Festival On 19 December 2007, Bell joined Weeping Willows on stage for an event called &quot;An Evening With Weeping Willows at Chinateatern&quot; He lined up with other prominent guests such as The Soundtrack of Our Lives&#x27; Martin Hederos, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen vocalist Ian McCulloch and Jens Lekman.

Bell has worked with Swedish band The Most on various recordings and contributed guitars and vocals on the song &quot;Now I Feel&quot; from the EP &quot;Moderation in Moderation&quot; (a title suggested by Bell). He stated on several occasions his intention to record and release a solo album. He said, &quot;I will get around to it, it&#x27;s just waiting for the songs to turn up that suit my voice. I&#x27;ve got one so far, give me about five years and I&#x27;ll have an album&#x27;s worth.&quot;

During 2008, Bell collaborated with British-American electronica group SPC ECO on the track &quot;Silver Clouds&quot;, on which he plays an electronic sitar drone machine and an old custom dulcimer, as well as devising the song&#x27;s lyrics. The song was made available in 2009 as a bonus track to the Japanese edition of SPC ECO&#x27;s album &quot;3-D&quot;. In 2009 he released his first solo recording under the Grapefruit name, an instrumental track also entitled &quot;Grapefruit&quot; which he contributed to the &quot;One by One: KZK Adidas Originals by Originals&quot; compilation album, a Japan only release via Sony Music.

Bell released his first solo single &quot;Plastic Bag&quot; on 23 October 2019 on 7 inch clear vinyl as a subscription for the Sonic Cathedral Singles Club. &quot;Plastic Bag&quot; and its B-side &quot;The Commune&quot;, were reissued digitally on 10 July 2020. His second solo single, and the first single from his debut solo album, was &quot;Love Comes in Waves&quot; and was released on 11 August 2020.

Bell released his debut studio album, &quot;The View from Half Way Down&quot; on 9 October 2020.

In 2022, Bell released a new album, &quot;Flicker&quot;, released as both single-CD and double-LP.

In 2023 Bell became part of a supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos with Shaun Ryder, Zak Starkey and Bez releasing their debut single &quot;Gorilla Guerilla&quot; in June ahead of a performance at the Glastonbury Festival.

===Scoring and soundtracks===
In 2015, Bell scored the short film &quot;Midnight of My Life&quot; and worked as a producer on Dave Galafassi&#x27;s track &quot;Hello Halo&quot;; it was performed by actress Toni Collette on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy film &quot;Miss You Already&quot;.

===Post-election changes===

Note: These by-election results are taken from newspaper reports, and may not exactly match the official returns.

Gordon Beard (PC) became (Ind) in 1968.

Turtle Mountain (results overturned and seat declared vacant, January 30, 1968), March 4, 1968:
*Edward Dow (L) 2443
*Allan Rose (PC) 2240
*Peter Sawatsky (SC) 610

Four seats became vacant in 1968:
*Dufferin Roblin (PC, Wolseley) and Rod Clement (Lib, Birtle-Russell) resigned to seek election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1968 Canadian general election. Both were unsuccessful.
*Gordon Beard (Ind, Churchill) resigned his seat after protesting that the government was not paying sufficient attention to issues affecting northern Manitoba.
*Harry Shewman (PC, Morris) died in office.

By-elections for all four ridings were called for February 20, 1969. The Progressive Conservative, Liberal, and New Democratic parties fielded candidates in all four ridings, and there was also an independent candidate in Churchill. The Social Credit Party intended to field a candidate in Morris, but ultimately did not do so.



The results for Birtle-Russell, Morris and Wolseley are taken from the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, 21 February 1969. The result from Churchill reflects the findings of a judicial review, and is taken from the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, 19 March 1969.

<doc id="1084336" wikidata="Q3631135" url="?curid=1084336" title="Hicky's Bengal Gazette">
<text>James Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette or the Original Calcutta General Advertiser was an English-language weekly newspaper published in Kolkata (then Calcutta), the capital of British India. It was the first newspaper printed in Asia, and was published for two years, between 1780 and 1782, before the East India Company seized the newspaper&#x27;s types and printing press. Founded by James Augustus Hicky, a highly eccentric Irishman who had previously spent two years in jail for debt, the newspaper was a strong critic of the administration of Governor General Warren Hastings. The newspaper was important for its provocative journalism and its fight for free expression in India.

==Newspaper history==
James Hicky began publication of James &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot; on 29 January 1780, having first printed a prospectus announcing that he would begin printing a newspaper. The idea of printing a newspaper in India had been floated twelve years earlier by the Dutch Adventurer William Bolts, but James Hicky was the first to execute the concept. James Hicky&#x27;s newspaper was printed once a week on Saturday, and retailed for Rs 1. Its circulation was estimated to be around four hundred copies per week, although possibly more.

Hicky initially avoided political controversy. As he observed the effect his paper had, he became more political and his neutral editorial policy shifted to an independent one. His slogan became &quot;Open to all Parties, but influenced by None&quot;. After he learned that competitors with ties to the East India Company were intending to launch a rival newspaper, the &quot;India Gazette&quot;, he took a strongly anti-Company stance. James Hicky accused an East India Company employee, Simeon Droz, of supporting the &quot;India Gazette&quot; as punishment for James Hicky&#x27;s refusal to pay a bribe to Droz and Marian Hastings, Warren Hastings&#x27; wife.

In retaliation for James Hicky&#x27;s accusation, Hastings&#x27; Supreme Council forbid James Hicky from mailing his newspaper through the post office. On 18 November 1780, the same day that the first &quot;India Gazette&quot; was published, James Hicky modified the name of his newspaper from James &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette; or, Calcutta General Advertiser&quot;, to James &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette; or the Original Calcutta General Advertiser&quot; to emphasize that his newspaper was founded first.

James Hicky claimed Hastings&#x27; order violated his right to free expression, and accused Hastings of corruption, tyranny, and even erectile dysfunction. James Hicky also accused other British leaders in Calcutta of corruption, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, Elijah Impey of taking bribes, and the leader of the Protestant Mission, Johann Zacharias Kiernander of stealing from an orphaned children&#x27;s fund. Hicky&#x27;s editorial independence was short lived as Hastings and Kiernander sued him for libel. After four dramatic trials in June 1781, the Supreme Court found Hicky guilty and sentenced him to jail.

James Hicky continued to print his newspaper from jail, and continued to accuse Hastings and others of corruption. He was finally suppressed when Hastings instituted fresh lawsuits against him. &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot; ceased publication on 30 March 1782 when its types were seized by an order of the Supreme Court. The next week, its types and printing press were publicly auctioned and sold to the &quot;India Gazette&quot;.

==Editorial policy==

&quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot; was known for its sarcastic and provocative writing style. Unlike many newspapers of its time, the newspaper discussed taboo topics like female masturbation, and proto-class consciousness, arguing for the rights of the poor and against taxation without representation. It was strongly anti-war and anti-colonial and routinely ridiculed East India Company leadership for their expansionist and imperialist objectives.

==Contemporary views==
The memoirist William Hickey (who was not related to the paper&#x27;s founder) describes its establishment shortly after he had succeeded (in his capacity as an attorney-at-law) in having James Hicky released from debtor&#x27;s jail:

&quot;At the time I first saw James Hicky he had been about seven years in India. During his confinement he met with a treatise upon printing, from which he collected sufficient information to commence [as a] printer, there never having been a press in Calcutta ... it occurred to Hicky that great benefit might arise from setting on foot a public newspaper, nothing of that kind ever having appeared. Upon his types &amp;c., therefore reaching him, he issued proposals for printing a weekly paper, which, meeting with extraordinary encouragement, he speedily issued his first work. As a novelty every person read it, and was delighted. Possessing a fund of low wit, his paper abounded with proof of that talent. He had also a happy knack at applying appropriate nicknames and relating satirical anecdotes&quot;.

Hicky benefited little from the paper, as William Hickey further tells us that he allowed it &quot;to become the channel of personal invective, and the most scurrilous abuse of individuals of all ranks, high and low, rich and poor, many were attacked in the most wanton and cruel manner ... His utter ruin was the consequence&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette&quot; was the first printed newspaper to be published in Asia. The newspaper became famous not only among the British soldiers posted in India at that time but also inspired Indians to write newspapers of their own.

==Surviving collections==
Six archives are known to have collections (all incomplete) of &quot;Hicky&#x27;s Bengal Gazette:&quot;
# University of Melbourne
# University of Heidelberg. From George Livius. Available for free online.
# National Library of India
# High Court of Calcutta (only an extraordinary issue dated 25 June 1781).
# British Library. Two collections. One originally from the British Museum, from George Livius. The other, less complete collection, is originally from a private auction and from the India Office Library.
# University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Bancroft Library. Collected by H. Morse Stephens sometime before 1907. This collection was likely once owned by Paul Ferris, one of Hicky&#x27;s assistants.

<doc id="1084342" wikidata="Q655163" url="?curid=1084342" title="Jacob Miller (musician)">
<text>Jacob Miller (4 May 1952 – 23 March 1980) was a Jamaican reggae artist and Rastafari from Mandeville, Jamaica. His first recording session was with the producer Clement &quot;Sir Coxsone&quot; Dodd in the late 1960s. While pursuing a solo career, he became the lead singer for Inner Circle, a Jamaican roots reggae band. Miller recorded and toured with Inner Circle before he died in a car crash in early 1980 at age 27.

== Early life ==
Born in Mandeville, Jamaica, in 1952, he was the only son of Joan Ashman, a choir singer and pianist. He never knew his father. As a child, he was mainly raised by his great aunt. His mother recounts him having an especially friendly personality. One day in Half Way Tree, he threw all his money in the air to give away to friends. According to his mother, he had a strong inclination toward music—often playing rhythms with his hands or drumsticks on pots, pans, and various items. In 1960, at the age of eight, he moved to Kingston, Jamaica.

== First recordings ==
The move to Kingston would prove to be a seminal event in his life. Although still very young, Miller began spending much of his spare time hanging around the city&#x27;s recording studios, most notably Clement &quot;Sir Coxsone&quot; Dodd&#x27;s now-famous Studio One. He was hoping to become the studio&#x27;s next big child star.

At just thirteen years old, he recorded three songs at Studio One for Dodd, but most notably &quot;Love is a Message&quot;. The two brothers and owners of the &quot;Rockers Sound System,&quot; Horace and Garth Swaby, played the song often around the time of its release (Horace would later become famous under the stage name Augustus Pablo). The song did not garner any real success, nor did it get much attention from Dodd; however it resulted in Horace Swaby befriending Miller and sparking an interest in him as a musician with potential.

== Musical career ==
After the Swaby brothers launched their own label in 1972, Horace—who&#x27;d taken the stage name Augustus Pablo—recorded a version of &quot;Love is a Message&quot; called &quot;Keep on Knocking&quot; in 1974. In the next year and a half, Miller recorded five more songs for Pablo, &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot;, &quot;False Rasta&quot;, &quot;Who Say Jah No Dread&quot;, &quot;Each One Teach One&quot;, and &quot;Girl Named Pat&quot;, each of which became a Rockers classic with King Tubby dubs on their b-sides. These singles developed Miller&#x27;s reputation as a great singer, and their success ultimately drew Inner Circle to hire him as a replacement lead singer.

Inner Circle was an emerging reggae group made popular playing covers of American Top 40 hits. Band leader Roger Lewis said Jacob Miller was &quot;always happy and jovial. He always made jokes. Everyone liked jokes.&quot; Adding Miller as lead singer, the band&#x27;s lineup was Roger Lewis on guitar, Ian Lewis on bass, Bernard &quot;Touter&quot; Harvey on keyboards, and Rasheed McKenzie on drums. Coining Miller as Jacob &quot;Killer&quot; Miller, the group continued to build popularity. In 1976, Inner Circle signed with Capitol Records. They released two albums, &quot;Reggae Thing&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Ready for the World&quot; in 1977.

At the same time, Miller continued pursuing a solo career, recording &quot;Forward Jah Jah Children,&quot; &quot;Girl Don&#x27;t Come&quot; produced by Gussie Clarke, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Natty&quot; produced by Joe Gibbs. &quot;I&#x27;m a Natty&quot; is a cover of the Wailers song &quot;Soul Rebel&quot; from their album &quot;Soul Rebels&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m a Natty&quot; features sampling from the Wailers&#x27; original track and its lyrics changed by Miller. He earned second place in Jamaica&#x27;s 1976 Festival Song competition with the song &quot;All Night &#x27;Till Daylight&quot; and produced his first solo album in 1976, &quot;Tenement Yard&quot;. While most of Miller&#x27;s solo work was backed by Inner Circle members, his preferred rockers style diverged from the tendency of Inner Circle to experiment with other genres, including pop, soul, funk and disco.

The track which has brought Miller the most lasting recognition is the dub reggae hit &quot;King Tubby Meets The Rockers Uptown&quot; with Augustus Pablo, a dub of &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot;, engineered by King Tubby. AllMusic called Miller&#x27;s vocal version, &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot;, &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and wrote: &quot;It says much about King Tubby&#x27;s genius that his phenomenal dub of this number would eclipse Jacob Miller&#x27;s own sublime vocal version&quot;. Decades later in 2004, the popular &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; video game franchise would use the dub version, &quot;King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown&quot;, in the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; on their in-game reggae radio station &quot;K-Jah West&quot;.

Other notable tracks featuring Miller&#x27;s vocals with Augustus Pablo&#x27;s music and/or dubs include &quot;Keep on Knocking&quot;, &quot;False Rasta&quot;, and &quot;Who Say Jah No Dread&quot;. The album &quot;Who Say Jah No Dread&quot; features two versions of each of these tracks; the original and a dub engineered by King Tubby.

== Acting and Personality ==
Miller made an eponymous cameo appearance in the cult classic roots reggae film &quot;Rockers&quot;, alongside several roots reggae musicians including Gregory Isaacs and Burning Spear. In &quot;Rockers,&quot; Miller plays a singer for a hotel&#x27;s house band—which is in fact Inner Circle—who are joined on drums by the film&#x27;s eponymous hero, Leroy &quot;Horsemouth&quot; Wallace (himself a musician). The band plays a shortened, live version of Inner Circle&#x27;s hit &quot;Tenement Yard&quot; during a scene. The film features what is, thus far, the only publicly-accessible video footage of Miller when he was not on stage. &quot;Rockers&quot; depicts Miller as he was in real life—a fun-loving and eccentric reggae singer who loved to play, eat, and sing.

== 1978: The One Love Peace Concert and &quot;Heartland Reggae&quot; (film) ==
In what were possibly his greatest performances of all time, Miller appeared at the One Love Peace Concert in 1978. The &quot;Peace Concert&quot; took place at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica on 22 April 1978, along with many of the most popular reggae acts of the day. Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, U-Roy, Judy Mowatt, Dennis Brown, Althea and Donna, and many more roots reggae artists and locally famous Rastafari were in attendance. The event drew countrywide attention. Rising tensions between the two dominant political parties, the Jamaica Labor Party and the People&#x27;s National Party, had many Jamaicans worried the concert would erupt into violence. Two bitter political rivals—Edward Seaga and incumbent prime minister Michael Manley—were to meet onstage and shake hands in front of Miller and other artists. Inner Circle wrote a song specially for the occasion titled &quot;Peace Treaty&quot;, which was a reggae interpretation of the popular folk tune &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;.

Jacob Miller and Inner Circle sets are featured prominently in the concert documentary film &quot;Heartland Reggae&quot;, which showcases the musical performances at the &quot;One Love Peace Concert&quot;, and chronicles the historical event of the aforementioned two political rivals shaking hands onstage. Miller played two separate sets at the concert—one at night on the main stage opening for Bob Marley and the Wailers, and during the daytime the following day on a small stage in an open field near the National Stadium. In both sets, Miller and Inner Circle played their new &quot;Peace Treaty&quot; song. During Inner Circle&#x27;s daytime set on a smaller stage nearby—as highlighted in the film &quot;Heartland Reggae—&quot;Miller brazenly donned a policeman&#x27;s hat and lit an enormous spliff (until 2015 cannabis was strictly illegal in Jamaica), followed by cheers of delight from the audience.

== Later life and death ==
In March 1980, Jacob Miller went with Bob Marley and Island Records founder Chris Blackwell to Brazil, to celebrate Island opening new offices in South America. Not long after returning to Jamaica Sunday, 23 March 1980, Miller and one of his sons died in a car accident on Hope Road in Kingston, Jamaica. Miller and Inner Circle had been preparing for an American tour with Bob Marley and the Wailers, and the next album, &quot;Mixed Up Moods&quot;, had been recorded before his death. The papers praised Miller in the announcement of his death, saying, &quot;He took the world by storm and would be missed for his playfulness, gaiety and laughter.&quot; Additionally, Archbishop Yeshaq of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church who hosted his funeral service said that &quot;Miller had a desire to help those in the ghetto [...] and made a plea for man to stop destroying his own brothers and sisters.&quot;

Jacob Miller was the cousin of British reggae artist Maxi Priest. Every year his Christmas album goes on heavy rotation during the holiday season in Jamaica, and is enjoyed amongst Jamaicans abroad as well.

<text>Adam Noah Levine ( ; born March 18, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter, television presenter, and actor. He is the frontman of the pop rock band Maroon 5, for which he serves as lead vocalist, guitarist, and sole continuous member. 

Levine began his musical career in 1994 with the band Kara&#x27;s Flowers, for which he served as lead vocalist and lead guitarist. After the commercial failure of their only album, &quot;The Fourth World&quot;, the group was reformed in 2001 as Maroon 5 – with James Valentine replacing him as lead guitarist. In 2002, they released their first album, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, which went multi-platinum in the US; since then, they have released six more albums: &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot; (2007), &quot;Hands All Over&quot; (2010), &quot;Overexposed&quot; (2012), &quot;V&quot; (pronounced: &quot;five&quot;) (2014), &quot;Red Pill Blues&quot; (2017), and &quot;Jordi&quot; (2021). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received multiple accolades, including three Grammy Awards. As a solo artist, Levine achieved concurrent commercial success with his guest appearance on Gym Class Heroes&#x27; 2011 single &quot;Stereo Hearts&quot;, which peaked within the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

From 2011 to 2019, and again from 2025–present, Levine has been featured as a coach on NBC&#x27;s reality talent show &quot;The Voice&quot;. The winners of multiple seasons (1, 5, and 9) belonged to his team. In 2012, Levine made his acting debut as the recurring character Leo Morrison in the second season of the television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. He also appeared in the films &quot;Begin Again&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2016), &quot;Fun Mom Dinner&quot; and &quot;The Clapper&quot; (both 2017). Levine launched his eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with Kmart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records, and a production company, 222 Productions, which produced television shows &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Songland&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that &quot;sources familiar with his many business dealings&quot; estimated Levine would earn more than $35 million that year.

==Early life==
Adam Noah Levine was born on March 18, 1979, in Los Angeles to Fredric Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor. They divorced when he was seven and Levine underwent therapy. Growing up, he spent weekdays with his mother and weekends with his father. He has a younger brother. Levine&#x27;s father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish; however, according to &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, he is spiritual but not religious. He chose not to have a Bar Mitzvah as a child because of the custom of receiving Bar Mitzvah gifts, explaining: &quot;I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and years and years and years of cultural heritage.&quot; Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, and television producer and writer Peter Noah.

Levine describes his family as &quot;very musical&quot; and credits his mother with &quot;start[ing] me out on the path.&quot; He also attributes his mother&#x27;s idols – Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles – to shaping his musical style, calling them &quot;a huge part of my upbringing&quot;. Levine attended Brentwood School, where he met Jesse Carmichael and Mickey Madden, his future bandmates. He carried his musical interests to high school, where he states he was &quot;a little rebellious. I didn&#x27;t want to do the things they were teaching me ... [music] consumed my every thought.&quot;

==Kara&#x27;s Flowers==
In February 1994, Levine, along with friends Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden, and Ryan Dusick formed garage band Kara&#x27;s Flowers. In 1995, the group played their first gig at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, with Levine performing vocals and guitar. The band was discovered while they were performing in Malibu by independent producer Tommy Allen, who along with his partner John DeNicola, had them record an 11-track album. Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to Reprise Records through producer Rob Cavallo.

In August 1997, the band released their first album, titled &quot;The Fourth World&quot; and also appeared on an episode of the drama series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Despite high expectations, it had little success, selling about 5,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouwman intrview/2004/April13_2_38_8.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reprise decided to drop the band after Cavallo&#x27;s exit from the label. Disappointed with the results of their album, the band broke up. Later, Levine would say of the experience: &quot;Kara&#x27;s Flowers was just floating up the wall beneath the sticks. Make a record quickly, put it out. No touring base, no nothing. Just try to make it happen right out of the gate and it just doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.

==Maroon 5==

After the break up of Kara&#x27;s Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue higher studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: &quot;That&#x27;s when I started waking up to the whole hip-hop, R&amp;B thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was &quot;not&quot; Brentwood High&quot;. They dropped out after a semester, and reunited with Madden and Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained the need for a makeover for the band: &quot;We were just so sick of being a typical rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration.&quot; The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before it caught the attention of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. Following Berkman&#x27;s advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine &quot;seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer [Levine], so he could be the star I perceived him to be&quot;.

Around this time, Levine had been working as a writer&#x27;s assistant on the CBS television show &quot;Judging Amy&quot;; the program&#x27;s producer Barbara Hall was his family friend. While on the show, he would spend time writing songs about his ex-girlfriend. These songs were put into Maroon 5&#x27;s debut album &quot;Songs About Jane,&quot; which was released in June 2002. The album slowly gained airplay, and eventually became a sleeper hit, selling an estimated 10 million copies and becoming the tenth best-selling album of 2004, two years after its release. In 2005, Maroon 5 won their first Grammy Award, for Best New Artist. The next year, they won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the second &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; single &quot;This Love&quot;.
By 2006, the band began recording again, and in May 2007, Maroon 5&#x27;s second album &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot; was released. Levine described the album as &quot;a vast improvement&quot;, explaining: &quot;I think this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically&quot;. To support the album, the band performed on a ten-date club tour which visited small venues in Europe and the United States from April to June 2007. The album and its lead, third and penultimate singles (&quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot;, &quot;Won&#x27;t Go Home Without You&quot; and &quot;If I Never See Your Face Again&quot;, respectively) each received Grammy nominations, although only &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot; secured a win.

After winding down from a world tour in support of &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot;, the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Levine said Lange &quot;worked me harder than anyone ever has&quot;. In 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album, &quot;Hands All Over&quot;. The album did not initially meet expectations. In an interview with &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Levine explained that the album suffered from being &quot;all these disparate ideas and songs that didn&#x27;t make any sense together&quot;. After the moderate success of the album&#x27;s first three singles, the band released &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot; (featuring Christina Aguilera) which Levine classified as &quot;one of those songs that was definitely a risk; it&#x27;s a bold statement&quot;. The single became a worldwide success; it was the ninth-best-selling digital single of 2011 with sales of 8.5 million copies and, , the eighth-best-selling digital single of all time. Levine later credited the song with &quot;totally reviving the band&quot;.
Since &quot;Moves Like Jagger&quot; was the first time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, entitled &quot;Overexposed&quot;. Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levine&#x27;s public ubiquity. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he opined that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: &quot;It&#x27;s very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it – but mostly I love it&quot;. The album and its lead single &quot;Payphone&quot; gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance nominations. In support of &quot;Overexposed&quot;, the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012 to 2013 (with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts), and also headlined the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, which included &quot;The Voice&quot; contestant Tony Lucca.

In 2014, Maroon 5 continued their collaboration with Ryan Tedder, Max Martin and others to release their fifth studio album &quot;V&quot; (pronounced: &quot;five&quot;). Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with &quot;Overexposed&quot;, saying: &quot;We developed a really nice system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them ... this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs.&quot; Five singles were released from it. In support of the album, the band undertook the Maroon V Tour, which kicked off with a show in Dallas in February 2015.

In 2007, Levine had stated that he believed Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: &quot;Eventually I want to focus on being a completely different person because I don&#x27;t know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond&quot;. But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:&quot;I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [but] we don&#x27;t have any plans on disbanding any time soon&quot;. He has also turned down the idea of having a solo career, stating that &quot;there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band&quot;. On February 10, 2017, Levine received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the recording industry.

==Other activities==

===Musical collaborations===

Levine has collaborated with several musical artists. In 2005, he was featured on the song &quot;Live Again&quot; by hip-hop duo Ying Yang Twins. The same year, he appeared on Kanye West&#x27;s album &quot;Late Registration&quot;, on the third single &quot;Heard &#x27;Em Say&quot;, a collaboration Levine called &quot;very pure and very easy&quot;. The song was created during an airplane flight that he and West shared, and its refrain was later used for the Maroon 5 song &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot; from &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot;. He also appeared on Alicia Keys&#x27; third album &quot;Alicia Keys: MTV Unplugged&quot;, as part of the cover of The Rolling Stones song &quot;Wild Horses&quot;. Around the same time, he featured on fellow Octone Records singer K&#x27;naan&#x27;s single &quot;Bang Bang&quot;.

In 2009, he recorded &quot;Gotten&quot;, a song for Slash&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Slash&quot; (2010). In February 2010, he was among approximately 80 musicians who sang on the charity-single remake of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, called &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti&quot;. In 2011, he appeared on the Gym Class Heroes song, &quot;Stereo Hearts&quot;. Levine also worked with hip-hop artist 50 Cent on his song &quot;My Life&quot;, recording the vocals almost two years before it was released as a single in 2012, which included rapper Eminem. In 2013, Levine wrote a song called &quot;My Most Terrible Secret&quot; performed by the cast of &quot;Community&quot;, in the episode &quot;Intro to Felt Surrogacy&quot;.

In 2015, Levine was featured on the song &quot;Painkiller&quot; by Rozzi Crane and the duo, R. City&#x27;s single &quot;Locked Away&quot;. In 2016, Levine collaborated with The Lonely Island for the song &quot;I&#x27;m So Humble&quot;, on the soundtrack album &quot;&quot;, which they also appeared in the . In April 2019, Levine and 29 other musical acts were featured on the charity single &quot;Earth&quot;, which raises climate change awareness. In late 2019, Levine collaborated with American actor and musician Joe Pesci, on his third album &quot;Pesci... Still Singing&quot;, with two songs &quot;Baby Girl&quot; and a cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;.

In 2020, Levine was featured on two songs &quot;Trust Nobody&quot;, with rapper Lil Wayne on his album &quot;Funeral&quot; and &quot;Same Guy&quot; by Jack Harlow on the album &quot;Thats What They All Say&quot;. Levine is also featured as a singer for his band&#x27;s song &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; in the music rhythm game, &quot;Band Hero&quot;. Levine has contributed with two songs for the soundtracks of the John Carney films: &quot;Lost Stars&quot; in &quot;Begin Again&quot; and &quot;Go Now&quot; in &quot;Sing Street&quot;.

===Television, film and media===
Levine has made four notable comic appearances on television. During 2007, he appeared in the 33rd-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in an SNL Digital Short called &quot;Iran So Far&quot;, performing with Andy Samberg, Fred Armisen and Jake Gyllenhaal. Levine played himself while singing a humorous bridge to a &quot;love song&quot; for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In 2008, he performed on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot;. He also had a cameo on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; for the night of stars and endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election. In 2013, he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and featured alongside Kendrick Lamar on Lonely Island&#x27;s digital short &quot;YOLO&quot;, which parodies the acronym for &quot;You Only Live Once.&quot; His hosting was generally disliked by reviewers, who called it &quot;mediocre&quot; and &quot;subpar.&quot; He appeared on season 40 of &quot;SNL&quot; where he played Freddie Mercury and sang a snippet of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in the &quot;Joan Rivers&quot; sketch.

From 2011 to 2019, Levine served as a contestant judge/coach on the reality talent television show, &quot;The Voice&quot;. The contestants of his team who won in the series are Javier Colon (season 1), Tessanne Chin (season 5) and Jordan Smith (season 9). &quot;The Voice&quot; has been credited with reviving Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;faltering&quot; career after the sub-par sales of &quot;Hands All Over&quot; as well as increasing Levine&#x27;s popularity. According to polling firm E-Poll Market Research, awareness of Levine has nearly tripled since he joined the show. He has also been described as the &quot;breakout&quot; star of the series, with #TeamAdam and @AdamLevine scoring a respective 203,000 and 2.14 million Twitter mentions in the show&#x27;s third season, higher than all the other coaches. In 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; estimated that Levine was paid $10–12 million for each season of &quot;The Voice&quot;. In May 2019, Levine left the series after sixteen seasons and eight years. In June 2024, it was revealed that Levine would return to &quot;The Voice&quot; for the 27th season set to air in the spring of 2025.

In 2012, Levine appeared as a recurring character in &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot;, the second season of the television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with his wife, played by Jenna Dewan. The scenes were shot around his band&#x27;s summer touring schedule. In an interview with &quot;E!&quot;, he said of his role: &quot;It sounded like so much fun and that&#x27;s why I wanted to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley&quot;. However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn&#x27;t watch the episodes because &quot;it&#x27;s just so weird and disturbing&quot;.

In June 2012, Levine was cast in the musical romance-drama film &quot;Begin Again&quot; (originally titled &quot;Can a Song Save Your Life?&quot;). The film was directed by John Carney and Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo acted in the lead roles. In it, he plays Dave Kohl, Knightley&#x27;s songwriting partner and former boyfriend of five years, who leaves her behind on finding success in the music industry. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to generally favorable reviews from critics.

In November 2013, Levine was named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sexiest Man Alive, becoming the first singer and the second non-actor (after John F. Kennedy, Jr.) to claim the title. He was ranked No. 41 on &quot;Glamour&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Sexiest Men of 2012&quot; list. In 2008, he appeared on &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Single and Sexy Men&quot; list. He was elected TV&#x27;s Most Crushworthy Male Reality Host/Judge in a poll held by Zap2it. In April 2012, &quot;Shalom Life&quot; ranked him Number 7 on its list of &quot;Top 50 Hottest Jewish men in the world&quot;. Levine stripped naked for testicular cancer awareness for a centerfold in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; UK&#x27;s February 2011 issue.

===222 Productions===
In 2013, Levine started a production company 222 Productions and the first project was &quot;Sugar&quot; (2018), a YouTube Premium web television series which was inspired by the music video for the Maroon 5 song of the same name. It follows music artists to crash events for unsuspecting fans. The company produced a reality competition series &quot;Songland&quot;, which premiered on NBC on May 28, 2019, where Levine served as executive producer. The company signed a deal with Wheelhouse Entertainment.

In October 2008, Levine collaborated with First Act to create the First Act 222 Guitar, which was fashioned to his specifications. The guitar was sold via Target stores. Two years later he launched his own fashion line, entitled &quot;222&quot;, at the Project Trade Show in Las Vegas. The collection features jeans, basic T-shirts and leather jackets. The venture was organized in partnership with his father, Fred Levine (who operates a chain of specialty boutiques), and his cousin, Sami Cooper.

In June 2011, Levine took part in an educational campaign to raise awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The project, titled &quot;Own It&quot;, was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with ADHD as a teenager, said: &quot;This campaign is important to me because it can help young adults and adults realize that there&#x27;s a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid&quot;. In connection to this, he wrote an article in &quot;ADDitude Magazine&quot; about his personal experience with it.

Levine founded his own record label, 222 Records in February 2012. He stated that he was inspired to start the label to sign on Rozzi Crane, an USC music student he discovered through a mutual friend. She became the first singer signed on to the label, followed by &quot;Glee&quot; actor Matthew Morrison, Mexican artist Diego Boneta, and &quot;The Voice&quot; season 2 contestant and part of Team Adam, the singer Tony Lucca. It was reported that he was negotiating further with potential distributors, as well as organizing staff, to operate as a full-fledged record company with departments such as marketing, radio and publicity.

In September 2012, Levine was in the Philippines to collaborate with the clothing company Bench; they launched the menswear collection. In January 2013, Levine announced he would be enter a partnership with Sears Holdings to launch a multi-department lifestyle brand of apparel and accessories collections. The company owns Kmart and ShopYourWay, a shopping social platform; it also includes rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. The menswear collection was launched on October 1 that year and conducts business via 500 Kmart stores across the US, as well as online. In an official statement, Levine said: &quot;Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity for me and I am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection&quot;. In an interview with &quot;People&quot;, he commented further, &quot;it was cool that they really promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in&quot;. Later, Levine became a celebrity spokesperson for Proactiv. In the commercial, Levine shares details about his acne experiences in high school, and promotes Proactiv Plus.

Levine collaborated with ID Perfumes to create his debut eponymous scent. The line was launched at the Premiere Fragrance Installation in Los Angeles in February 2013. The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy&#x27;s department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: &quot;The task was to make something that I would wear. So that was a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and it smells great&quot; The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, in which he said that he wanted to &quot;put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward&quot;. In January 2020, Levine announced that he is the new Ambassador of the brand Shure for the wireless earphones and headphones, the Aonic 215 and 50, is available on electronic stores on April 2, 2020.

==Artistry==

Levine&#x27;s interest in music started at around ten years of age, when he first started playing the guitar. He found music as an outlet for his feelings, stating: &quot;I picked up a guitar and that was it. I fell so madly in love with it, it&#x27;s all I did&quot;. He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but he was so nervous that he played with his back to the audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Phish and Michael Jackson. He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, he explained the diversity of his influences: &quot;I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the &#x27;70s&quot;.

Levine remembers that listening to &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; by Aaliyah convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of the band he was performing with at the time, Kara&#x27;s Flowers. His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved hip-hop, R&amp;B, gospel and soul music. He took to changing his musical style, extensively emulating Stevie Wonder. Subsequently, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; was released, deemed &quot;bluesy funk&quot; and similar to the sound of English pop rock band Busted. Critics also drew comparisons between Levine and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay.

While earlier work was deemed &quot;vaguely funky white-soul&quot; and &quot;rock&quot;, recent ones have been judged to have a more reggae, anthemic pop sound, evoking comparisons to Coldplay. Levine refuses to fit his music into a genre, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s so much variety in music, it&#x27;s silly to belong to a specific club and try to sound a certain way&quot;. He considers himself an orthodox lyricist sticking to conventional themes, acknowledging: &quot;Romance, love, the lack thereof are still very big themes. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I&#x27;m still limited to that one thing.&quot; He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview: &quot;I was so sick of typical lyrics like &#x27;Ooh, baby&#x27; and &#x27;I love you&#x27; and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach&quot;.
Levine is a tenor, with a 4 octave vocal range and has been noted for his falsettos. Salon wrote: &quot;When he&#x27;s crooning come-ons, his voice lends the music a satisfying lewdness, a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency.&quot; In a review of &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described his vocals as &quot;smug, R&amp;B-slick deadpan ... there&#x27;s a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery&quot;. In another review, Allmusic wrote &quot;he knows that he&#x27;s a pop guy, somewhat in the tradition of Hall &amp; Oates, but he isn&#x27;t trying to be retro, he&#x27;s ... making records that are melodic, stylish, and soulful&quot;. In a review of the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; also commented positively on his on-stage presence, which &quot;exude[s] a sense of up-for-anything playfulness ... combined with a rock solid work ethic and a clear love for their audiences and performing&quot;.

Levine&#x27;s popularity outside of his musical work has seen him tagged as a &quot;stand-alone star,&quot; which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine&#x27;s fame has been a boost to the band, with &quot;Paper&quot; writing: &quot;Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks in no small part to their frontman&#x27;s uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining&quot;. &quot;Delta Sky&quot; described him as &quot;a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man&quot;. He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: &quot;We talked about it a long time ago and decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman.&quot;

==Personal life==
In early 2010, while performing at the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas, Levine met Russian &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue model Anne Vyalitsyna and they soon began a relationship. They ended the relationship in April 2012 in an &quot;amicable and supportive manner&quot;.

In May 2012, Levine began dating Behati Prinsloo, a Namibian Victoria&#x27;s Secret model. The couple married on July 19, 2014, with Jonah Hill officiating the wedding. Levine and Prinsloo have two daughters, Dusty Rose (b. September 21, 2016) and Gio Grace (b. February 15, 2018). On January 28, 2023, Levine and Prinsloo had a third child, who is their first son.

Levine is supportive of gay rights. In 2011, Levine made a video on Maroon 5&#x27;s official YouTube account in support of the It Gets Better Project. In January 2012, he announced that Maroon 5 had changed the location of their post-Grammy Awards show because of the &quot;unnamed Los Angeles restaurant&#x27;s backing of Proposition 8&quot;. He has a gay brother.

In 2013, Levine was mentioned in a hostile work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group&#x27;s Santa Monica location was &quot;infiltrated with pervasive drug use where you could smell marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges&quot;. The guard claimed that when she complained about the cannabis smoke coming from one of the studios, she was told that &quot;it&#x27;s Adam Levine—if he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it&#x27;s OK&quot;. In an official statement to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, UMPG (Universal Music Publishing group) described the allegations as &quot;absurd&quot;.

In July 2020, Levine and Prinsloo collaborated with Ferrari and Save the Children to raise funds to support U.S. education programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Levine and Prinsloo founded a tequila company called Calirosa. The brand&#x27;s tequila bottles were made available from December 2021.

In September 2022, Levine was accused by at least four women of cheating on his then-partner, Prinsloo, with them. DMs, texts, and TikTok videos were presented as evidence. Levine denied having an affair, but has admitted to &quot;crossing&quot; the line and has &quot;addressed ... and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family&quot;.

<text>Jesse Royal Carmichael (born April 2, 1979) is an American musician, best known as the keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the pop rock band, Maroon 5. He is one of only two remaining original members of the group, along with frontman Adam Levine. He also has a solo project called 1863 and a side project titled Circuit Jerks.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and Kara&#x27;s Flowers ===
Jesse Carmichael was born in Boulder, Colorado, United States. Carmichael first started playing piano at a young age, his father Bob getting him his own keyboard at age 7. The first songs he learned were Mozart and Bach tunes, with the two composers being some of his biggest influences even to this day. Carmichael began learning guitar in the seventh grade, after his older sister gifted him one for Christmas. At that point, his musical taste was largely influenced by Grunge.

Later that year, the Carmichael family would move, and Jesse would begin attending a new school, which would be Brentwood School in Los Angeles. It was there at Brentwood where he&#x27;d meet Adam Levine, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick. The three would introduce him to classic rock bands like The Beatles and The Kinks (although his father did show him &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;). Not long after, the four would start a band called Kara&#x27;s Flowers, and almost as fast would begin searching for a label to release their music. After self-releasing an album titled &quot;We Like Digging?&quot;, the band were signed to Reprise Records. In 1997, they released their debut studio album, &quot;The Fourth World&quot;. Although the group got the help of Rob Cavallo, the album flopped, and the band would soon be dropped from the label. After the failure of &quot;The Fourth World&quot;, the band would slow down. Carmichael and Levine would attended Five Towns College in Dix Hills, New York. While in college, Carmichael turned his sights back on the keyboards. After only a semester, the two would drop out and return to California, bringing with them new musical influences.

=== Maroon 5 ===

On March 9, 2012, Carmichael announced he would be taking a break from performing with Maroon 5 for an undetermined amount of time to focus more on his studies of &quot;music and the healing arts&quot;. During his hiatus, the band&#x27;s touring keyboardist, PJ Morton was promoted to an official member and took over Carmichael&#x27;s keyboard duties to fill-in for his absence. However several months later, on October 10, 2012, Carmichael confirmed that he would be returning to the band after they completed their Overexposed World Tour, expanding the group&#x27;s membership to six after Morton&#x27;s promotion. He rejoined in time for the band to record their fifth studio album &quot;V&quot; (2014). After his return to the band, he began playing guitar in the band more often, in part due to him playing it more often during his hiatus, but also due to the addition of Morton and friend and longtime collaborator Sam Farrar.

== Personal life ==
On July 27, 2018, Carmichael&#x27;s fiancé (now wife) Tara gave birth to their first son. On August 19, 2020, their second son was born.

Carmichael was Adam Levine’s best man during his wedding in 2014.

Carmichael spends his time trying to learn more about music. He attended Santa Monica College from 2001 to 2002, and again in 2005. Nowadays, he visits numerous teachers for his piano and guitar playing, as well as his vocal performance, and also takes orchestration lessons.

=== Other ventures ===

In 2016, Carmichael joined with musician and producer Jason Lader and formed a side project titled Circuit Jerks. The group released an extended play titled &quot;EP1&quot; on September 9, 2016. He also released a solo EP under the name &quot;1863&quot;, which was chosen due to it being the year Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

<text>James Burgon Valentine (born October 5, 1978) is an American musician who is the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the pop band Maroon 5.

== Early life ==
Valentine was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and has three sisters and one brother. His mother is a former beauty queen, who was a school teacher before becoming a stay-at-home mom to raise her five children. His younger sister, Amanda Valentine, has been a contestant on &quot;Project Runway&quot; two times starring in Season 11 and Season 13, as well as &quot;Project Runway All Stars&quot; once in Season 6. James is an Eagle Scout. He was the president of his high school Lincoln Southeast High School&#x27;s student council in Lincoln, Nebraska. He graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and attended Berklee College of Music.

In addition to guitar, Valentine is also a percussionist, playing in orchestra and jazz band in his youth.

== Career ==
Valentine played in Lincoln bands: Montag, Kid Quarkstar, Mondello and Happy Dog. In 2000, Happy Dog changed its name to Square and he moved to Los Angeles from Anaheim, California, where he taught private guitar lessons out of his home. Valentine had also played with Reel Big Fish, firstly when guitarist Aaron Barrett broke his hand in 2000, and later in 2001, when Barrett fell down some stairs. Valentine displayed a picture from one Reel Big Fish show he played during Maroon 5&#x27;s appearance on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;. Eventually the members of Square and Kara&#x27;s Flowers became friends and when Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick began looking for another guitarist, Valentine was approached. The band Kara&#x27;s Flowers changed their name to Maroon. Personal tensions in Square helped the decision to join the band and shortly afterward, Kara&#x27;s Flowers became Maroon 5.

Valentine is a friend of John Mayer, whom he met in 1996 at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Valentine once tried to get Mayer to move to Lincoln to play guitar for the Lincoln blues rock band Baby Jason and the Spankers. An opening slot on Mayer&#x27;s 2003 summer tour helped bring widespread exposure to Maroon 5. Valentine contributed guitar work to Mayer&#x27;s September 2006 release &quot;Continuum&quot; on the songs &quot;Stop This Train&quot; and &quot;In Repair.&quot;

Valentine also played guitar on Jenny Lewis&#x27; 2006 solo album, &quot;Rabbit Fur Coat&quot; with The Watson Twins and has appeared in her music video for the first single, &quot;Rise Up with Fists!!&quot;.

=== Phases ===

Phases (originally called JJAMZ) is a band composed of James Valentine (Maroon 5), Jason Boesel (Rilo Kiley/Conor Oberst), Alex Greenwald (Phantom Planet), Michael Runion (solo), and Z Berg (The Like). The group was started at karaoke night at Guys in Hollywood. The band name was an acronym using the first letter of each member&#x27;s name. The group was means of escape from each member&#x27;s respective bands. &quot;[Phases] started at an interesting time in all of our lives. We all needed some kind of escape from relationships or our other bands. It was a tumultuous time, and the lyrics just came out. It was like word vomit. I can&#x27;t remember.&quot; said Z Berg, lead vocalist for the Like. The band played their first concert at the Echo Plex on January 27, 2009. They released their debut album &quot;Suicide Pact&quot; on July 10, 2012. Later, Valentine left the band due to work with Maroon 5 and the band changed their name to Phases.

== Personal life == 
Valentine married yoga instructor Alexis Novak on February 6, 2023.

<doc id="1084355" wikidata="Q262903" url="?curid=1084355" title="Lisp Machines">
<text>Lisp Machines, Inc. was a company formed in 1979 by Richard Greenblatt of MIT&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to build Lisp machines. It was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

By 1979, the Lisp Machine Project at MIT, originated and headed by Greenblatt, had constructed over 30 CADR computers for various projects at MIT. Russell Noftsker, who had formerly been administrator of the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab some years previously and who had since started and run a small company, was convinced that computers based on the artificial intelligence language LISP had a bright future commercially. There were a number of ready customers who were anxious to get machines similar to ones they had seen at MIT.

Greenblatt and Noftsker had differing ideas about the structure and financing of the proposed company. Greenblatt believed
the company could be &quot;bootstrapped&quot;, i.e. financed practically from scratch from the order flow from customers (some of whom were willing to pay in advance). This would mean that the principals of the company would retain control. Noftsker favored
a more conventional venture capital model, raising a considerable sum of money, but with the investors having control of the company. The two negotiated at length, but neither would compromise. The ensuing discussions of the choice rent the lab into two factions. In February, 1979, matters came to a head. Greenblatt believed that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the funding of the company. Most sided with Noftsker, believing that a commercial venture fund-backed company had a better chance of surviving and commercializing Lisp Machines than Greenblatt&#x27;s proposed self-sustaining start-up. They went on to start Symbolics Inc.

Alexander Jacobson, a consultant from CDC, was trying to put together an AI natural language computer application, came to Greenblatt, seeking a Lisp machine for his group to work with. Eight months after Greenblatt had his disastrous conference with Noftsker, he had yet to produce anything. Alexander Jacobson decided that the only way Greenblatt was going to actually start his company and build the Lisp machines that Jacobson needed, was if he pushed and financially helped Greenblatt launch his company. Jacobson pulled together business plans, a board, and a partner, F. Stephen Wyle, for Greenblatt. The newfound company was named &quot;LISP Machine, Inc.&quot; (LMI), and was funded mostly by order flow including CDC orders, via Jacobson.

==History of LMI==
The following parable-like story is told about LMI by Steven Levy and used for the first time in &quot;&quot; (1984). Levy&#x27;s account of hackers is in large part based on the values of the hackers at MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Among these hackers was Richard Stallman, whom Levy at the time called the last true hacker.

When Noftsker started Symbolics, while he was able to pay salaries, he didn&#x27;t actually have a building or any equipment for the programmers to work on. He bargained with Patrick Winston that, in exchange for allowing Symbolics&#x27; staff to keep working out of MIT, Symbolics would let MIT use internally and freely all the software Symbolics developed. Unfortunately this openness would later lead to accusations of intellectual property theft.

In the early 1980s, to prevent software from being used on their competitors&#x27; computers, manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such proprietary software had existed before, but this shift in the legal characteristics of software was triggered by the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976; see software copyright.

While both companies delivered proprietary software, Richard Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab. Stallman had proclaimed that &quot;the prospect of charging money for software was a crime against humanity.&quot; He clarified, years later, that it is blocking the user&#x27;s freedom that he believes is a &quot;crime&quot;, not the act of charging for a copy of the software.
Symbolics had recruited most of the remaining MIT hackers including notable hacker Bill Gosper, who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics forced Greenblatt to also resign at the AI lab, by citing MIT policies. So for two years at the MIT AI Lab, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman singlehandedly duplicated the efforts of the Symbolics programmers, in order to prevent them from gaining a monopoly on the lab&#x27;s computers. Although LMI was able to benefit from Stallman&#x27;s freely available code, he was the last of the &quot;hackers&quot; at the lab. Later programmers would have to sign non-disclosure agreements not to share source code or technical information with other software developers.

== Struggle and decline ==
Lisp Machines, Inc. sold its first LISP machines, designed at MIT, as the LMI-CADR. After a series of internal battles, Symbolics began selling the CADR from the MIT Lab as the LM-2. Symbolics had been hindered by Noftsker&#x27;s promise to give Greenblatt a year&#x27;s head start, and by severe delays in procuring venture capital. Symbolics still had the major advantage that while none of the AI Lab hackers had gone to work for Greenblatt, a solid 14 had signed onto Symbolics. There were two AI Lab people who choose not to be employed by either: Richard Stallman and Marvin Minsky.
Symbolics ended up producing around 100 LM-2s, each of which sold for $70,000. Both companies developed second-generation products based on the CADR: the Symbolics 3600 and the LMI-LAMBDA (of which LMI managed to sell around 200). The 3600, which shipped a year late, expanded on the CADR by widening the machine word to 36-bits, expanding the address space to 28-bits, and adding hardware to accelerate certain common functions that were implemented in microcode on the CADR. The LMI-LAMBDA, which came out a year after the 3600, in 1983, was mostly upward compatible with the CADR (source CADR microcode fragments could be reassembled), but there were improvements in instruction fetch and other hardware differences including use of a multiplier chip and a faster logic family and cache memory. The LAMBDA&#x27;s processor cards were designed to work in a NuBus-based engineering workstation, the NuMachine, which had been originated by Steve Ward&#x27;s group at MIT, and, through a separate chain of events, was being developed by Western Digital Corporation. This allowed the popular LAMBDA &quot;2x2&quot; configuration whereby two machines shared one infrastructure, with considerable savings. Texas Instruments (TI) joined the fray by investing in LMI after it ran out of money, purchasing and relocating the NuBus engineering workstation unit from Western Digital, licensing the LMI-LAMBDA design and later producing its own variant, the TI Explorer.

Symbolics continued to develop the 3600 family and its operating system, Genera, and produced the Ivory, a VLSI chip implementation of the Symbolics architecture. Texas Instruments shrunk the Explorer into silicon as the Explorer II and later the MicroExplorer. LMI abandoned the CADR architecture and developed its own K-Machine, but LMI went bankrupt in 1987 before the machine could be brought to market.

==GigaMos Systems==
LMI was reincarnated as GigaMos Systems; Greenblatt was one of its officers. GigaMos, through the ownership of a Canadian backer named Guy Montpetit, bought the assets of LMI through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Prior to the incorporation of GigaMos, LMI developed a new Lisp machine called the &quot;K-machine&quot; which used a RISC-like architecture. Montpetit subsequently became embroiled in a 1989 Canadian political scandal which, as a side-effect, resulted in the seizure of all the assets of GigaMos, rendering the company unable to meet payroll.

==Inspiration for Stallman and Free Software==
According to Richard Stallman, the dispute between LMI and Symbolics inspired Stallman to start software development for the GNU operating system in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in October 1985. These were forerunners of the open-source-software movement and the Linux operating system.

<text>Big Choice is a full-length album by the California punk band Face to Face, released in 1995. It was released on Victory Music in 1995, and then re-released on A&amp;M Records. &quot;Disconnected&quot; was released to alternative radio on January 20, 1995. &quot;Debt&quot; was released as a single on August 15, 1995. 

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that singer &quot;[Trever] Keith dwells on his inner struggles in self-questioning songs that focus on the gap between idealistic aspirations and flawed, frustrating realities.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Trever Keith and Matt Riddle unless otherwise noted.
# &quot;Struggle&quot; – 3:07
# &quot;I Know You Well&quot; – 2:42
# &quot;Sensible&quot; – 2:58
# &quot;A-OK&quot; – 2:57
# &quot;You Lied&quot; – 3:27
# &quot;Promises&quot; – 3:15
# &quot;Big Choice&quot; – 3:24
# &quot;It&#x27;s Not Over&quot; – 2:26
# &quot;Velocity&quot; – 3:17
# &quot;Debt&quot; – 2:19
# &quot;Late&quot; – 3:37
# (blank) * – 1:16
# &quot;Disconnected&quot; * – 3:20
# &quot;Bikeage&quot; * (cover of Descendents) – 2:09

The &#x27;*&#x27; marks indicate that it&#x27;s a bonus track. Those songs were featured on the 1995 re-release as bonus tracks. The original pressing had just the first eleven tracks. The twelfth track is sometimes referred to as &quot;Untitled&quot; or &quot;Song 12&quot;, but is actually titled as blank. The track features a conversation about re-recording &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which originally appeared on their first album &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Away&quot; and would be the following track on this album, because no one could &quot;hear a single&quot; until KROQ-FM first played it. However, the track is not featured on the track listing from the back cover of the album. Rock poster artist Jim Evans (T.A.Z.), worked closely with the band to create the unique album art featuring the &quot;Big Choice&quot; game machine.

<doc id="1084391" wikidata="Q1867453" url="?curid=1084391" title="Lochnagar">
<text>Lochnagar or  is a mountain in the Mounth, in the Grampians of Scotland. It is about south of the River Dee near Balmoral. It is a popular hill with hillwalkers, and is a noted venue for summer and winter climbing. At the foot of the mountain is a lochan, Lochan na Gaire, from which the mountain&#x27;s name derives.

== Names ==
The English name refers to a mountain loch in the northeast corrie, , the &#x27;little loch of the noisy sound&#x27;. or , &#x27;mountain of breasts&#x27; or &#x27;breast-shaped mountain&#x27;, is probably the original Gaelic name for the mountain.

The summit itself is , meaning &#x27;small cairn of faeces&#x27; in Gaelic, or less euphemistically, &#x27;little pile of shit&#x27;. Peter Drummond, former chairman of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, has also suggested that is a corruption of (&#x27;slope&#x27;), which would lend a translation of &#x27;little cairn of the slope&#x27;.

== Geography ==

Lochnagar is located on the Royal Estate of Balmoral. Its principal feature is a north-facing corrie, around which most of the subsidiary tops, as well as the main peak, sit. The corrie is the location of many classic summer and winter climbing routes. The mountain is a Munro and is popular with hillwalkers at all times of the year, with the most common ascent route being from Glen Muick. Care should be taken on the summit in poor visibility: the plateau has few obvious features and has steep cliffs on its northern edge.

== Climate ==
Lochnagar&#x27;s summit experiences an Alpine Tundra Climate, with freezing, snowy winters and cool summers. The nearest UK Met Office weather station is at Braemar northwest. The yearly temperature range is usually between . January has the highest average frosts, despite February nights being colder; January has an average of 26.9 frost days, compared with 24.3 in February. There is the risk of a frost at any time of the year, even in July and August, when each month averages 1 air frost every 10 years.

==Nature and conservation==
Lochanagar lies within the Cairngorms National Park, and also gives its name to &quot;Deeside and Lochnagar National Scenic Area&quot;, one of 40 such areas in Scotland. The designated national scenic area is in size, and covers the mountains surrounding Lochnagar as far south as the head of Glen Doll, as well Deeside to the north.

The mountain forms part of two designated Special Protection Areas, due to its importance for breeding dotterel (&quot;Charadrius morinellus&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;).

==Cultural references==
Due to its location on the Balmoral estate the mountain has many royal links, and Queen Victoria climbed to the summit in 1848. In the film &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;, John Brown and Benjamin Disraeli hike up Lochnagar to discuss the need for the Queen to return to active involvement with government. It is also the setting for a children&#x27;s story, &quot;The Old Man of Lochnagar&quot;, originally told by Prince Charles. In 2023, a recessional tune entitled &quot;The Call of Lochnagar&quot; was composed for the service at which Charles III was presented the Honours of Scotland.

The poet Lord Byron spent time in the area in his youth, and wrote the poem, &quot;Lachin y Gair&quot; (also known as &quot;Dark Lochnagar&quot;), which also forms the basis of a song which would eventually be composed by Beethoven.

A malt-whisky distillery located near the Balmoral estate on the south side of the River Dee produces the Royal Lochnagar Single Malt whisky.

The hill gives its name to one of the houses at Aboyne Academy.

<doc id="1084394" wikidata="Q7448220" url="?curid=1084394" title="Self-surgery">
<text>Self-surgery is the act of performing a surgical procedure on oneself. It can be an act taken in extreme circumstances out of necessity, an attempt to avoid embarrassment, legal action, or financial costs, or a rare manifestation of a psychological disorder.

==Genitals==
These surgeries are generally the least life-threatening. Sometimes people resort to self-surgery in the form of castration in an attempt to control their sexual urges, or due to gender dysphoria.

Boston Corbett, the soldier who killed Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassin John Wilkes Booth, had performed self-surgery earlier in life. He castrated himself with a pair of scissors in order to avoid the temptation of prostitutes. Afterwards, he went to a prayer meeting and ate a meal before going for medical treatment.

==Abdominal==
Successful abdominal self-surgery is extremely rare. A few well-publicized cases have found their way into the medical literature.
*On February 15, 1921, Evan O&#x27;Neill Kane carried out his own appendectomy in an attempt to prove the efficacy of local anesthesia for such operations. He is believed to have been the first surgeon to have done so. However, Kane previously performed appendectomies (on others) with local anesthetic. In 1932, he performed an even more risky self-operation of repairing his inguinal hernia at the age of 70.
*In August of 1944, Jock McLaren, an Australian Army officer, conducted an appendectomy on himself without anaesthesia of any kind, using only a pocket knife and a mirror. He then proceeded to suture himself with what he had on hand - &quot;jungle fibre&quot;. Though not qualified in human medicine or surgery, McLaren had considerable knowledge of veterinary medicine.
*On April 30, 1961, Leonid Rogozov removed his own infected appendix at the Soviet Novolazarevskaja Research Station in Antarctica, as he was the only physician on staff. The operation lasted one hour and 45 minutes. Rogozov later reported on the surgery in the &quot;Information Bulletin of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition&quot;.
*A male student who had already performed a self-castration was the subject of a 1979 case report by Kalin. The student, some time after his self-castration, also attempted to reduce the activity of his adrenal glands with an injection of bovine serum albumin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and Freund&#x27;s adjuvant. When this produced an abscess at the injection site, he resorted to self-surgery. His psychiatrist reported:
*In 2000, a Mexican woman, Inés Ramírez, was forced to resort to self-surgery – a &quot;self-inflicted caesarean section&quot; – because of lack of medical assistance during a difficult labour: &quot;She took three small glasses of hard liquor and, using a kitchen knife, sliced her abdomen in 3 attempts ... cut the uterus itself longitudinally, and delivered a male infant. Both mother and child reportedly survived and are now well.&quot;

==Medically supervised==
Jerri Nielsen was the sole physician on duty at the U.S. National Science Foundation Amundsen–Scott Antarctic research station in 1999 when she found a lump on her breast. She was forced to biopsy the lump herself. Her experience made international news and was the basis for her autobiography, &quot;Ice Bound&quot;. The lump was found to be cancerous, so she self-administered chemotherapeutic agents. She remained cancer-free for several years but died in 2009 after her cancer reappeared and spread to her brain.

==Self-trepanation==
Trepanation involves drilling a hole in the skull. The most famous instances of self-trepanation are those of Amanda Feilding, Joey Mellen (Feilding&#x27;s domestic partner), and Bart Huges (who influenced Mellen and Feilding). In 2023, Michael Raduga performed self-neurosurgery that included electrical stimulation of the motor cortex.

==Amputation of trapped limbs==
*In 1993, Donald Wyman amputated his leg with his pocketknife after it was pinned by a tree.
*In 1993, Bill Jeracki was fishing near St. Mary&#x27;s Glacier in Colorado, when a boulder pinned his left leg. Snow was forecast and without a jacket or pack, Jeracki did not believe he would survive the night. Fashioning a tourniquet out of his flannel shirt and using his bait knife, he cut his leg off at the knee joint, using hemostats from his fishing kit to clamp the bleeding arteries.
*In 2000, British Special Air Service veteran and adventurer, Sir Ranulph Fiennes received severe frostbite on his left hand in a failed solo North Pole expedition. After abandoning the trip and while waiting in England for further medical care, the pain of the necrotized tissue became unbearable. Fiennes retired to his garden shed and amputated his own digits with a power saw after clamping them in a vise. He survived and went on to other expeditions, including summitting Mount Everest and an abandoned Antarctic traverse. 
*In 2002, Doug Goodale cut off one of his arms at the elbow in order to survive an accident at sea.
*In 2003, Aron Ralston was on a canyoneering trip in Bluejohn Canyon (near Moab, Utah), when a boulder fell and pinned his right forearm down, crushing it. First he tried to chip away the rock around his hand with his pocket knife, but gave up the attempt after two days. Next he tried to lift and move the boulder with a simple pulley system made with rope and gear, but that failed too. On the sixth day, which he did not expect to live to see upon falling asleep the night earlier, a dehydrated and delirious Ralston had a vision of himself as a one-armed man playing with his future son. Upon a subsequent fit of rage he discovered that he could bow his arm against the chockstone far enough to snap the radius and ulna bones. Using the dull blade on his multi-use tool, he cut the soft tissue around the break. He then used the tool&#x27;s pliers to tear at the tougher tendons. He was careful not to sever the arteries before attaching an improvised tourniquet. After he cut the main bundle of nerves, leading to agonizing pain, he cut through the last piece of skin and was free. In bad physical shape, and having lost more than a litre of blood, he managed to rappel 70 feet down and hike another 8 miles, when he ran into a Dutch family who offered help and guided him to a rescue helicopter which happened to be nearby looking for Ralston and took him to a hospital. His story was dramatized in the film &quot;127 Hours&quot; (2010).
*In 2003, an Australian coal miner trapped three kilometres underground by an overturned tractor cut off his own arm with a box-cutting knife. The 44-year-old man, who was not identified by police, was working late at the Hunter Valley mine when the tractor tipped over, crushing his arm and trapping him.

== Mouth ==

During 1992-1993 Vendée Globe, a solo race around the world, sailor Bertrand de Broc who had be hit full in the face by a rope, had to sew his tongue himself after a doctor telexed instructions on how to sew stitches into the wound.

<doc id="1084395" wikidata="Q216793" url="?curid=1084395" title="Josh Holloway">
<text>Joshua Lee Holloway (born July 20, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford on the ABC television show &quot;Lost&quot; and as Will Bowman on the USA Network science fiction drama &quot;Colony&quot;. He also had a recurring role in the third season of the Paramount Network western series &quot;Yellowstone&quot;.

== Early life ==
Holloway was born in San Jose, California, the second of four boys of a nurse mother and a surveyor father. His family moved to the Blue Ridge Mountains of Georgia when he was two. He was raised in Free Home, Georgia. Holloway is related to Baptist preacher Dr. Dale Holloway, and author and World War II prisoner of war Carl Holloway. He is also a descendant of Robert E. Lee. Holloway attended Cherokee High School in Canton, Georgia, graduating in 1987. He developed an interest in movies at a very young age. He studied at the University of Georgia but left after one quarter due to financial constraints.

== Career ==

Holloway moved to Los Angeles, where he began a successful career as a runway and print model, including for brands Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. In 1993, Holloway appeared in the Aerosmith video for the song &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; as a thief who tries to steal Alicia Silverstone&#x27;s backpack from a diner, only to be caught and beaten up by her.

Holloway eventually started acting. His first role was as &quot;Good Looking Guy&quot; in an episode of &quot;Angel&quot; in 1999, followed by a role in the comedy &quot;Doctor Benny&quot; and in the movies &quot;Mi Amigo&quot;, &quot;Moving August&quot;, and &quot;Cold Heart&quot;. Following these roles, he gained recognition for his lead role in the Sci-Fi Channel movie &quot;Sabretooth&quot; with David Keith and John Rhys-Davies. He also made appearances in &quot;Good Girls Don&#x27;t&quot; episode &quot;Addicted To Love&quot;; &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;My Other Left Foot&quot;; &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot; episode &quot;Separation Anxiety&quot;; &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; episode &quot;Medieval Crimes&quot;; and &quot;&quot; episode &quot;&quot;.His big break came when he was cast as James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford in the hit television series &quot;Lost&quot;. The show propelled Holloway to celebrity status, but left him with little time to leverage his fame with other roles. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, he took himself out of consideration for a role in a Brad Pitt Western due to the demands of his filming schedule. Nevertheless, he found time to star in the thriller &quot;Whisper&quot; and he also ventured into the world of video games in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;. In the game, he plays the role of a Brotherhood of Nod intelligence officer named Ajay whose primary role is to assist players by supplying information that is crucial to upcoming battles. In May 2007, 20th Century Fox approached Holloway for the second time and offered him the role of Gambit in &quot;X-Men 4&quot;. In 2005, &quot;People&quot; magazine named Holloway one of the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot;. In January 2006, &quot;In Touch Weekly&quot; named Holloway the &quot;hottest hunk&quot; on television. In the same month, Holloway was voted the seventeenth-sexiest guy worldwide by British readers of &quot;OK!&quot; magazine. In the same year, he was voted the second-sexiest star in Hollywood by &quot;Us Weekly&quot;.

In March 2007, Holloway was selected as the new face for Davidoff&#x27;s fragrance Cool Water worldwide. In Spring 2008, Holloway was selected as the first male spokesperson for Magnum ice cream of Turkey. Previous Magnum spokespersons include Eva Longoria and Elizabeth Hurley. In the same year he made the top ten list of &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Sexiest Stars.

Holloway appeared in the 2009 film &quot;Stay Cool&quot;, a comedy written by the Polish brothers. Artist Salvador Larroca is believed by Comic Book Resources columnist Timothy Callahan to have used Holloway as the model for his rendition of Tony Stark during his run on &quot;Iron Man&quot;, which began in 2008. In June 2010, Holloway won a Saturn Award for &quot;Best Actor on Television&quot; for his role on &quot;Lost&quot;. In September 2010, Holloway was added to the cast of &quot;&quot;, which was released in December 2011. In 2014, Holloway starred in the lead role in the CBS television show &quot;Intelligence&quot; as a cybercrime agent who can &quot;access the entire electromagnetic spectrum&quot; with his mind.

In 2016, Holloway began starring in &quot;Colony&quot; as Will Bowman, a former FBI agent who, in a bid to protect his family, is forced to collaborate with the occupational government to bring down the growing resistance movement inside the L.A. colony in the near future. &quot;Colony&quot; marked a &quot;Lost&quot; reunion for Holloway and executive producer Carlton Cuse.

== Personal life ==
At the end of shooting the &quot;Lost&quot; pilot in Oahu, Hawaii, Holloway proposed to his long-time girlfriend, Yessica Kumala. The couple married on October 1, 2004. They have two children.

<text>Martin David Kruskal (; September 28, 1925 – December 26, 2006) was an American mathematician and physicist. He made fundamental contributions in many areas of mathematics and science, ranging from plasma physics to general relativity and from nonlinear analysis to asymptotic analysis. His most celebrated contribution was in the theory of solitons.

He was a student at the University of Chicago and at New York University, where he completed his Ph.D. under Richard Courant in 1952. He spent much of his career at Princeton University, as a research scientist at the Plasma Physics Laboratory starting in 1951, and then as a professor of astronomy (1961), founder and chair of the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (1968), and professor of mathematics (1979). He retired from Princeton University in 1989 and joined the mathematics department of Rutgers University, holding the David Hilbert Chair of Mathematics.

Apart from serious mathematical work, Kruskal was known for mathematical diversions. For example, he invented the Kruskal count, a magical effect that has been known to perplex professional magicians because it was based not on sleight of hand but on a mathematical phenomenon.

==Personal life==
Martin David Kruskal was born to a Jewish family in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle. He was generally known as Martin to the world and David to his family. His father, Joseph B. Kruskal Sr., was a successful fur wholesaler. His mother, Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer, became a noted promoter of the art of origami during the early era of television and founded the Origami Center of America in New York City, which later became OrigamiUSA. He was one of five children. His two brothers, both eminent mathematicians, were Joseph Kruskal (1928–2010; discoverer of multidimensional scaling, the Kruskal tree theorem, and Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm) and William Kruskal (1919–2005; discoverer of the Kruskal–Wallis test).

Martin Kruskal&#x27;s wife, Laura Kruskal, was a lecturer and writer about origami and originator of many new models. They were married for 56 years. Martin Kruskal also invented several origami models including an envelope for sending secret messages. The envelope could be easily unfolded, but it could not then be easily refolded to conceal the deed. Their three children are Karen (an attorney), Kerry (an author of children&#x27;s books), and Clyde, a computer scientist.

==Research==

Martin Kruskal&#x27;s scientific interests covered a wide range of topics in pure mathematics and applications of mathematics to the sciences. He had lifelong interests in many topics in partial differential equations and nonlinear analysis and developed fundamental ideas about asymptotic expansions, adiabatic invariants, and numerous related topics.

His Ph.D. dissertation, written under the direction of Richard Courant and Bernard Friedman at New York University, was on the topic &quot;The Bridge Theorem For Minimal Surfaces&quot;. He received his Ph.D. in 1952.

In the 1950s and early 1960s, he worked largely on plasma physics, developing many ideas that are now fundamental in the field. His theory of adiabatic invariants was important in fusion research. Important concepts of plasma physics that bear his name include the Kruskal–Shafranov instability and the Bernstein–Greene–Kruskal (BGK) modes. With I. B. Bernstein, E. A. Frieman, and R. M. Kulsrud, he developed the MHD (or magnetohydrodynamic) Energy Principle. His interests extended to plasma astrophysics as well as laboratory plasmas.

In 1960, Kruskal discovered the full classical spacetime structure of the simplest type of black hole in general relativity. A spherically symmetric spacetime can be described by the Schwarzschild solution, which was discovered in the early days of general relativity. However, in its original form, this solution only describes the region exterior to the event horizon of the black hole. Kruskal (in parallel with George Szekeres) discovered the maximal analytic continuation of the Schwarzschild solution, which he exhibited elegantly using what are now called Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.

This led Kruskal to the astonishing discovery that the interior of the black hole looks like a &quot;wormhole&quot; connecting two identical, asymptotically flat universes. This was the first real example of a wormhole solution in general relativity. The wormhole collapses to a singularity before any observer or signal can travel from one universe to the other. This is now believed to be the general fate of wormholes in general relativity. In the 1970s, when the thermal nature of black hole physics was discovered, the wormhole property of the Schwarzschild solution turned out to be an important ingredient. Nowadays, it is considered a fundamental clue in attempts to understand quantum gravity.

Kruskal&#x27;s most widely known work was the discovery in the 1960s of the integrability of certain nonlinear partial differential equations involving functions of one spatial variable as well as time. These developments began with a pioneering computer simulation by Kruskal and Norman Zabusky (with some assistance from Harry Dym) of a nonlinear equation known as the Korteweg–de Vries equation (KdV). The KdV equation is an asymptotic model of the propagation of nonlinear dispersive waves. But Kruskal and Zabusky made the startling discovery of a &quot;solitary wave&quot; solution of the KdV equation that propagates non-dispersively and even regains its shape after a collision with other such waves. Because of the particle-like properties of such a wave, they named it a &quot;soliton&quot;, a term that caught on almost immediately.

This work was partly motivated by the near-recurrence paradox that had been observed in a very early computer simulation of a certain nonlinear lattice by Enrico Fermi, John Pasta, Stanislaw Ulam and Mary Tsingou at Los Alamos in 1955. Those authors had observed long-time nearly recurrent behavior of a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators, in contrast to the rapid thermalization that had been expected. Kruskal and Zabusky simulated the KdV equation, which Kruskal had obtained as a continuum limit of that one-dimensional chain, and found solitonic behavior, which is the opposite of thermalization. That turned out to be the heart of the phenomenon.

Solitary wave phenomena had been a 19th-century mystery dating back to work by John Scott Russell who, in 1834, observed what we now call a soliton, propagating in a canal, and chased it on horseback. In spite of his observations of solitons in wave tank experiments, Scott Russell never recognized them as such, because of his focus on the &quot;great wave of translation,&quot; the largest amplitude solitary wave. His experimental observations, presented in his Report on Waves to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1844, were viewed with skepticism by George Airy and George Stokes because their linear water wave theories were unable to explain them. Joseph Boussinesq (1871) and Lord Rayleigh (1876) published mathematical theories justifying Scott Russell&#x27;s observations. In 1895, Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries formulated the KdV equation to describe shallow water waves (such as the waves in the canal observed by Russell), but the essential properties of this equation were not understood until the work of Kruskal and his collaborators in the 1960s.

Solitonic behavior suggested that the KdV equation must have conservation laws beyond the obvious conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum. A fourth conservation law was discovered by Gerald Whitham and a fifth one by Kruskal and Zabusky. Several new conservation laws were discovered by hand by Robert Miura, who also showed that many conservation laws existed for a related equation known as the Modified Korteweg–de Vries (MKdV) equation. With these conservation laws, Miura showed a connection (called the Miura transformation) between solutions of the KdV and MKdV equations. This was a clue that enabled Kruskal, with Clifford S. Gardner, John M. Greene, and Miura (GGKM), to discover a general technique for exact solution of the KdV equation and understanding of its conservation laws. This was the inverse scattering method, a surprising and elegant method that demonstrates that the KdV equation admits an infinite number of Poisson-commuting conserved quantities and is completely integrable. This discovery gave the modern basis for understanding of the soliton phenomenon: the solitary wave is recreated in the outgoing state because this is the only way to satisfy all of the conservation laws. Soon after GGKM, Peter Lax famously interpreted the inverse scattering method in terms of isospectral deformations and Lax pairs.

The inverse scattering method has had an astonishing variety of generalizations and applications in different areas of mathematics and physics. Kruskal himself pioneered some of the generalizations, such as the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities for the sine-Gordon equation. This led to the discovery of an inverse scattering method for that equation by M. J. Ablowitz, D. J. Kaup, A. C. Newell, and H. Segur (AKNS). The sine-Gordon equation is a relativistic wave equation in 1+1 dimensions that also exhibits the soliton phenomenon and which became an important model of solvable relativistic field theory. In seminal work preceding AKNS, Zakharov and Shabat discovered an inverse scattering method for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

Solitons are now known to be ubiquitous in nature, from physics to biology. In 1986, Kruskal and Zabusky shared the Howard N. Potts Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute &quot;for contributions to mathematical physics and early creative combinations of analysis and computation, but most especially for seminal work in the properties of solitons&quot;. In awarding the 2006 Steele Prize to Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura, the American Mathematical Society stated that before their work &quot;there was no general theory for the exact solution of any important class of nonlinear differential equations&quot;. The AMS added, &quot;In applications of mathematics, solitons and their descendants (kinks, anti-kinks, instantons, and breathers) have entered and changed such diverse fields as nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and ocean, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. Nonlinearity has undergone a revolution: from a nuisance to be eliminated, to a new tool to be exploited.&quot;

Kruskal received the National Medal of Science in 1993 &quot;for his influence as a leader in nonlinear science for more than two decades as the principal architect of the theory of soliton solutions of nonlinear equations of evolution&quot;.

In an article surveying the state of mathematics at the turn of the millennium, the eminent mathematician Philip A. Griffiths wrote that the discovery of integrability of the KdV equation &quot;exhibited in the most beautiful way the unity of mathematics. It involved developments in computation, and in mathematical analysis, which is the traditional way to study differential equations. It turns out that one can understand the solutions to these differential equations through certain very elegant constructions in algebraic geometry. The solutions are also intimately related to representation theory, in that these equations turn out to have an infinite number of hidden symmetries. Finally, they relate back to problems in elementary geometry.&quot;

In the 1980s, Kruskal developed an acute interest in the Painlevé equations. They frequently arise as symmetry reductions of soliton equations, and Kruskal was intrigued by the intimate relationship that appeared to exist between the properties characterizing these equations and completely integrable systems. Much of his subsequent research was driven by a desire to understand this relationship and to develop new direct and simple methods for studying the Painlevé equations. Kruskal was rarely satisfied with the standard approaches to differential equations.

The six Painlevé equations have a characteristic property called the Painlevé property: their solutions are single-valued around all singularities whose locations depend on the initial conditions. In Kruskal&#x27;s opinion, since this property defines the Painlevé equations, one should be able to start with this, without any additional unnecessary structures, to work out all the required information about their solutions. The first result was an asymptotic study of the Painlevé equations with Nalini Joshi, unusual at the time in that it did not require the use of associated linear problems. His persistent questioning of classical results led to a direct and simple method, also developed with Joshi, to prove the Painlevé property of the Painlevé equations.

In the later part of his career, one of Kruskal&#x27;s chief interests was the theory of surreal numbers. Surreal numbers, which are defined constructively, have all the basic properties and operations of the real numbers. They include the real numbers alongside many types of infinities and infinitesimals. Kruskal contributed to the foundation of the theory, to defining surreal functions, and to analyzing their structure. He discovered a remarkable link between surreal numbers, asymptotics, and exponential asymptotics. A major open question, raised by Conway, Kruskal and Norton in the late 1970s, and investigated by Kruskal with great tenacity, is whether sufficiently well behaved surreal functions possess definite integrals. This question was answered negatively in the full generality, for which Conway et al. had hoped, by Costin, Friedman and Ehrlich in 2015. However, the analysis of Costin et al. shows that definite integrals do exist for a sufficiently broad class of surreal functions for which Kruskal&#x27;s vision of asymptotic analysis, broadly conceived, goes through. At the time of his death, Kruskal was in the process of writing a book on surreal analysis with O. Costin.

Kruskal coined the term asymptotology to describe the &quot;art of dealing with applied mathematical systems in limiting cases&quot;. He formulated seven Principles of Asymptotology: 1. The Principle of Simplification; 2. The Principle of Recursion; 3. The Principle of Interpretation; 4. The Principle of Wild Behaviour; 5. The Principle of Annihilation; 6. The Principle of Maximal Balance; 7. The Principle of Mathematical Nonsense.

The term asymptotology is not so widely used as the term soliton. Asymptotic methods of various types have been successfully used since almost the birth of science itself. Nevertheless, Kruskal tried to show that asymptotology is a special branch of knowledge, intermediate, in some sense, between science and art. His proposal has been found to be very fruitful.

<text>Reformed Theological Seminary (RTS) is a theological seminary in the Reformed theological tradition with campuses in multiple locations in the United States. Founded by conservatives in the Southern Presbyterian Church, the Presbyterian Church in the United States, in 1966, it serves primarily students from more conservative branches of the Presbyterian and Reformed traditions.

==Founding==

In 1966, conservatives from the Southern Presbyterian Church, the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), concerned about the increasing influence of liberalism and neo-orthodoxy in the denomination&#x27;s seminaries and pulpits, established Reformed Theological Seminary, independent from the PCUS, along &quot;Old School&quot; Presbyterian lines, to educate ministers. RTS has largely served the Presbyterian Church in America since that denomination&#x27;s founding in 1973, then later the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and in more recent years serves a large population of students from Particular Baptist and independent churches.

==Leadership==
RTS is governed by a board of trustees exercising oversight through its administration. RTS is led by its executive committee, the chancellor of the RTS system and through the respective campus presidents. Ligon Duncan is Chancellor and CEO.

==Academics==
RTS follows the Reformed tradition, including Covenant Theology.

===Accreditation===
Reformed Theological Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada to award the MDiv, MABS, MAR, MATS, MAC, MACC, and DMin degrees. It is also accredited by Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award masters and doctorate degrees. The MAC degree program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs.

===Programs of study===

RTS&#x27;s institutional focus is on training students (especially in its Presbyterian and Reformed branches) to be pastors, missionaries, educators, and Christian counselors. RTS offers Doctor of Ministry (DMin), Master of Divinity (MDiv), and Master of Arts (MA) degrees in several subjects. Through its Global program, RTS offers the Master of Arts (Biblical studies) degree (MABS) and the Master of Arts (Theological Studies) degree (MATS). The degrees can be earned completely online.

===Faculty===
RTS has had many notable faculty members, adjunct professors, and visiting lecturers, including R.C. Sproul, John Frame, Roger Nicole, Ronald H. Nash, Steve Brown, Douglas F. Kelly, Richard L. Pratt, Jr., Michael J. Kruger, Justin S. Holcomb, Bruce Waltke, Willem A. VanGemeren, and Tim Keller.

In April 2010, Bruce Waltke offered to resign his professorship at Reformed Theological Seminary because of controversy over a video made by The BioLogos Foundation where he discussed his positive views on evolution. Waltke wrote in a letter that he found no fault with the administration of RTS on the matter.

==Campuses==
RTS has campus locations in Jackson, Mississippi; Orlando, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Washington, D.C.; as well as its Global Campus. RTS also has sites in New York City, as well as Dallas and Houston in Texas.

RTS&#x27;s Washington, D.C. campus is a member of the Washington Theological Consortium.

RTS&#x27;s global campus traces its origins to the Orlando campus, from which distance education was first offered for RTS students in the early 1990s. In 1998, the Global campus became a separate &quot;campus&quot;. The global campus eventually became the first online seminary to offer accredited degrees.

<text>Joseph Benjamin Higgs (3 June 1940 – 18 December 1999) was a reggae musician from Jamaica. In the late 1950s and 1960s he was part of the duo Higgs and Wilson together with Roy Wilson. He was a popular artist in Jamaica for four decades and is also known for his work tutoring younger musicians including Bob Marley and the Wailers and Jimmy Cliff.

==Biography==
Higgs was instrumental in the foundation of modern Jamaican music, first recording in 1958 for producer and businessman (and later Jamaican Prime Minister) Edward Seaga, both as a solo artist and with Roy Wilson. He is often called the &quot;Godfather of Reggae&quot;. His first release (with Wilson) was &quot;Oh Manny Oh&quot; in 1958, which was one of the first records to be pressed in Jamaica and went on to sell 50,000 copies. Higgs and Wilson also recorded for Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The partnership with Wilson dissolved in 1964 when Wilson emigrated to the United States. Higgs then concentrated on a solo career and also worked with Carlos Malcolm and the Afro-Jamaican Rhythms, before joining Lynn Taitt&#x27;s The Soul Brothers as lead vocalist.

Higgs mentored young singers in his yard and began working with Bob Marley in 1959. In fact, it was at one of the informal music lessons Joe Higgs held in Trench Town, that Bob and Bunny Livingston met Peter Tosh. Marley acknowledged later on that Higgs had been an influential figure for him, while Higgs described their time together: &quot;I am the one who taught the Wailers the craft, who taught them certain voice technique&quot;. It was Higgs who introduced the Wailers to Dodd in 1963.

Higgs has also been described as the &quot;Father of Reggae&quot; by Jimmy Cliff. For a while Higgs toured with Cliff, acting as his bandleader as well as writing songs for Cliff including &quot;Dear Mother&quot;, and also performed with The Wailers on their US tour when Bunny Wailer refused to go on the tour in 1973. Higgs wrote &quot;Steppin&#x27; Razor&quot; in 1967 as his entry in the Festival Song Contest, later recorded by Tosh without crediting Higgs. Higgs later won a court case to establish his rights as composer but never received any profits from the song&#x27;s success.

Higgs won the Jamaican Tourist Board Song Competition in 1972 with &quot;Invitation to Jamaica&quot;, released as a single on his own Elevation label, and much of his best-known solo work was issued in the 1970s. Singles included &quot;More Slavery&quot; (released on Micron), &quot;Creation&quot; (Ethnic Fight), &quot;Let Us Do Something&quot; (Elevation), and &quot;World Is Upside Down&quot; (Island). His debut album, &quot;Life of Contradiction&quot;, had been recorded in 1972 for Island Records, but as Island boss Chris Blackwell felt that it would be difficult to market it remained unreleased until 1975, when it was issued by Micron Music, and has been described as &quot;a seminally sophisticated work combining reggae, jazz, and rhythm and blues influences to create a new texture that would have a profound effect on the best Jamaican music to follow&quot;. As well as The Wailers, Higgs also helped several other singers and groups including The Wailing Souls.

His second album, &quot;Unity Is Power&quot;, was released in 1979 and further singles followed on Cliff&#x27;s Sunpower label and Bunny Wailer&#x27;s Solominic imprint. His 1983 single &quot;So It Go&quot;, with a lyric critical of the Jamaican government of the day was banned from airplay and led to harassment which would eventually lead to Higgs relocating to Los Angeles, where he lived for the rest of his life. Two further albums were released in the 1980s, &quot;Triumph&quot; (1985) and &quot;Family&quot; (1988), and in 1990 he recorded &quot;Blackman Know Yourself&quot; on which he was backed by the Wailers Band, and includes covers of the Marley/Lee Perry songs &quot;Small Axe&quot; and &quot;Sun Is Shining&quot;. In 1995, his final album was issued, &quot;Joe and Marcia Together&quot;, a collaboration with his daughter.

A majority of Higgs&#x27; songs were connected to his impoverished life in Trenchtown where he grew up. Higgs considered that it was out of the poverty and violence of Kingston&#x27;s shantytowns such as Trenchtown and Johnstown that the reggae music had grown. Before reggae hit big on the western music scene with Bob Marley, it was understood as a &quot;ghetto music&quot;. Higgs was the very first artist out the ghetto music scene to have lyrics which primarily dealt with everyday troubles. In his own words:
&quot;Music is a matter of struggle. It&#x27;s not good that it&#x27;s known you&#x27;re from Trenchtown. Reggae is a confrontation of sound. Reggae has to have that basic vibrant sound that is to be heard in the ghetto. It&#x27;s like playing the drum and bass very loud. Those are the basic sounds. A classical reggae should be accepted in any part of the world. Freedom, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s asking for; acceptance, that&#x27;s what it needs, and understanding, that&#x27;s what reggae&#x27;s saying. You have a certain love come from hard struggle, long suffering. Through pain you guard yourself with that hope of freedom, not to give up...&quot;&quot;

Higgs died of cancer on 18 December 1999 at Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles. At the time of his death he was working with Roger Steffens on an official biography, and had been working on a collaboration with Irish artists, including John Alexander Reed and Ronald Padget for the &quot;Green on Black&quot; album. He was survived by twelve children, including his daughter Marcia, who is a rapper, and son Peter, a studio guitarist.

In 2006, the Joe Higgs Music Awards were established in his honour.

==Quotations==

From memorial website:

*&quot;Joe Higgs was a brother amongst the Wailers for years. He was encouragement, and he inspired us and kept us together.&quot; – Peter Tosh (1976)
*&quot;We looked up to Joe Higgs. He was something like a musical guardian for us. He was a more professional singer, because he was working for years with a fella named Roy Wilson as Higgs &amp; Wilson. They had a lotta hits and they had the knowledge of the harmony techniques, so he taught us [The Wailers] them. And he helped in the studio, to work out our different parts.&quot; – Bunny Wailer (1980&#x27;s)
*&quot;Joe Higgs helped me understand that music. He taught me many things.&quot; – Bob Marley

<text>The Super Friendz are a Canadian indie rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were initially active between 1994 and 1997, before reforming in 2002, with sporadic activity since then.

Contemporaries of Sloan, their early work was on Sloan&#x27;s Murderecords label.

==Career==
The Super Friendz were formed in 1994 by three King&#x27;s College students Charles Austin (vocals and bass), Matt Murphy (vocals and guitar), Drew Yamada (vocals and guitar). Until 1996, the band had no permanent drummer, at various times Chris Murphy (no relation to Matt) of Sloan, Cliff Gibb of Thrush Hermit, and Dave Marsh filled the role until Lonnie James was chosen as a permanent member.

In 1994, The Super Friendz released the cassette &quot;Sticktoitiveness&quot; independently, and the single &quot;By Request&quot; on Murderecords, and later toured Canada with Sloan.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Mock Up, Scale Down&quot; was released on Murderecords on July 14, 1995. The singles &quot;10 lbs.&quot;, &quot;Karate Man&quot; and &quot;Rescue Us from Boredom&quot; were released from the album, which was a Juno Award nominee for Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1996.

In 1996, the band contributed the song &quot;Blue Tattoo&quot; to the compilation album &quot;A Tribute to Hard Core Logo&quot;. On July 23, 1996, the band released the EP &quot;Play the Game, Not Games&quot; on Murderecords. The songs on &quot;Play the Game&quot;—especially the contributions of Austin and Yamada—were significantly more experimental than on the album.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Slide Show&quot;, was released on February 25, 1997. Critical response to the album was highly favorable, although some identified signs of creative tension in the album&#x27;s diverse array of styles.

On May 23, 1997, a compilation album of sorts was released for the United States market on March Records. It was titled, confusingly, &quot;Sticktoitiveness&quot;, but rather than the 1994 cassette, it contained new mixes of most songs on &quot;Mock Up, Scale Down&quot; and five from &quot;Play The Game, Not Games.&quot;

By August 1997, the band had broken up.

==Post-breakup==

Matt Murphy later re-emerged with a new band called The Flashing Lights. He has also played with the bands City Field and Cookie Duster, and starred in the film &quot;The Life and Hard Times of Guy Terrifico&quot;. In 2015, he formed a new band, TUNS, with Chris Murphy and Mike O&#x27;Neill.

Austin and Yamada launched the project Neuseiland with Joel Plaskett, then of Thrush Hermit. Austin is now a recording engineer and producer in Halifax, and has contributed to albums by Buck 65, Matt Mays, Joel Plaskett, Garrett Mason and many others.
Yamada later toured with O&#x27;Neill and others, before leaving the music industry full-time to pursue post-secondary education. James went on to release two critically acclaimed solo records on Teenage USA, as well as recording and touring as a drummer in Royal City.

==Reunion (2002-present)==

In late December 2002, the Super Friendz came back together for a special holiday reunion. The band recorded a reunion album, &quot;Love Energy&quot;, which was released June 30, 2003 on Outside Music. A small tour followed that September. Dave Marsh has been the band&#x27;s drummer from the 2002 reunion to present. 

In early 2006, a fourth studio album was self-produced, with the working title of &quot;Mick Mojo McKinzey Skunk&quot; but it has yet to be released. Song titles included &quot;Altamont,&quot; &quot;Every Year,&quot; &quot;Home Again,&quot; &quot;Shannon Park,&quot; &quot;Local Heroes,&quot; and &quot;Majesty of Rock.&quot;

Between the years of 2012 to 2014, the band has performed at such music festivals as the 2012 Halifax Pop Explosion, North by Northeast 2013, and Hillside Music Festival.

The original cassette &quot;Sticktoitiveness&quot; was remastered and released as a CD in March 2006. &quot;Mock Up, Scale Down&quot; was reissued on Murderecords on vinyl as a 2×LP in 2013.

<text>Malcolm David Kelley (born May 12, 1992), sometimes credited as just Malcolm Kelley, is an American actor and singer best known for portraying the character Walt Lloyd on the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; and as one half of the pop duo MKTO.

==Career==
===Acting===
Kelley&#x27;s first major acting role was in the 2002 film &quot;Antwone Fisher&quot;, in which he played the title character as a child. Prior to this, he appeared in several small television roles in programs such as &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Judging Amy.&quot; His next film role was &quot;You Got Served,&quot; in which he was cast in the supporting role of Lil&#x27; Saint.

In 2004, he was cast to play Walt in the TV show &quot;Lost.&quot; A regular cast member in the show&#x27;s first season (2004–2005), he appeared only occasionally thereafter due to a dramatic growth spurt. He returned for an appearance in &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, Lost&#x27;s third season finale, and twice more in the fourth season, with the episodes &quot;Meet Kevin Johnson&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home&quot;, and reprised his role in the fifth season with the episode &quot;The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham&quot;. He reprised the role of Walt a final time in the Season 6 DVD box set mini-episode &quot;The New Man in Charge&quot;.

Following his departure from the main cast of &quot;Lost,&quot; Kelley appeared in several television roles, including the recurring character of Benjamin Cooley on &quot;Saving Grace.&quot;

In 2010, he appeared in the lead role of Finn on the TeenNick program &quot;Gigantic.&quot; The show was canceled after one season in 2011.

In 2014, he appeared in a guest role as himself and Tony Oller on &quot;The Thundermans&quot; as MKTO.

In 2017, he played Black in the film &quot;True to the Game&quot; and Michael Clark in &quot;Detroit&quot;.

===Music===
In 2012, Kelley and his former &quot;Gigantic&quot; co-star Tony Oller formed the pop duo MKTO. They were signed to Columbia Records. In 2013 Kelley recorded together with Celine Dion, the song &quot;save your soul&quot; for Dion&#x27;s late 2013 release &quot;loved me back to life&quot;. But their duet version was only included on the album&#x27;s vinyl version. On the regular version, save your soul only contains Dion&#x27;s vocals.

The duo&#x27;s debut self-titled album, was released on April 1, 2014. Their single &quot;Classic&quot; was a major hit in the summer of 2014, reaching number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<doc id="1084420" wikidata="Q7524279" url="?curid=1084420" title="Singulation">
<text>Singulation is a method by which an RFID reader identifies a tag with a specific serial number from a number of tags in its field. This is necessary because if multiple tags respond simultaneously to a query, they will jam each other. In a typical commercial application, such as scanning a bag of groceries, potentially hundreds of tags might be within range of the reader.

When all the tags cooperate with the tag reader and follow the same anti-collision protocol, also called singulation protocol,
then the tag reader can read data from each and every tag without interference from the other tags.

== Collision avoidance ==

Generally, a collision occurs when two entities require the same resource; for example, two ships with crossing courses in a narrows. In wireless technology, a collision occurs when two transmitters transmit at the same time with the same modulation scheme on the same frequency. In RFID technology, various strategies have been developed to overcome this situation.

== Tree walking ==
 There are different methods of singulation, but the most common is &quot;tree walking&quot;, which involves asking all tags with a serial number that starts with, for instance, a 0 to respond. If more than one responds, the reader might ask for all tags with a serial number that starts with 01 to respond, and then 010. It keeps refining the qualifier until only one tag responds. Note that if the reader has some idea of what tags it wishes to interrogate, it can considerably optimise the search order. For example with some designs of tags, if a reader already suspects certain tags to be present then those tags can be instructed to remain silent, then tree walking can proceed without interference from these.

This simple protocol leaks considerable information because anyone able to eavesdrop on the tag reader alone may be able to determine all but the last bit of a tag&#x27;s serial number. Thus a tag can be (largely) identified so long as the reader&#x27;s signal is receivable, which is usually possible at much greater distance than simply reading a tag directly. Because of privacy and security concerns related to this, the Auto-ID Labs have developed two more advanced singulation protocols, called Class 0 UHF and Class 1 UHF, which are intended to be resistant to these sorts of attacks. These protocols, which are based on tree-walking but include other elements, have a performance of up to 1000 tags per second.

The tree walking protocol may be blocked or partially blocked by RSA Security&#x27;s blocker tags.

== ALOHA ==

The first offered singulation protocol is the ALOHA protocol, originally used decades ago in ALOHAnet and very similar to CSMA/CD used by Ethernet. These protocols are mainly used in HF tags. In ALOHA, tags detect when a collision has occurred, and attempt to resend after waiting a random interval. The performance of such collide-and-resend protocols is approximately doubled if transmissions are synchronised to particular time-slots, and in this application time-slots for the tags are readily provided for by the reader. ALOHA does not leak information like the tree-walking protocol, and is much less vulnerable to blocker tags, which would need to be active devices with much higher power handling capabilities in order to work. However when the reader field is densely populated, ALOHA may make much less efficient use of available bandwidth than optimised versions of tree-walking. In the worst case, an ALOHA protocol network can reach a state of congestion collapse. The Auto-ID consortium is attempting to standardise a version of an ALOHA protocol which it calls Class 0 HF. This has a performance of up to 200 tags per second.

== Slotted Aloha ==

Slotted Aloha is another variety offering better properties than the initial concept. It is implemented in most of the modern bulk detection systems, especially in the clothing industry.

== Listen before talk ==

This concept is known from polite conversation. It applies as well to wireless communication, also named &quot;listen before send&quot;. With RFID it is applied for concurrence of readers (CSMA) as well as with concurrence of tags.

<doc id="1084436" wikidata="Q7754877" url="?curid=1084436" title="The Old Man of Lochnagar">
<text>The Old Man of Lochnagar is a 1980 children&#x27;s book written by King Charles III, at that time the Prince of Wales, and illustrated by Sir Hugh Casson. The story revolves around an old man who lives in a cave in the cliffs surrounding the corrie loch under the Lochnagar, a mountain which overlooks the royal estate at Balmoral in Scotland where the Royal Family spend much of their summer holidays.

The story of the Old man of Lochnagar originated as a bedtime story King Charles had told some years earlier to entertain his brothers, Andrew and Edward, when they were children. The book was published in 1980 in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust charity.

The book was later adapted into an animated short film by the BBC in 1993, with Robbie Coltrane providing the voice of the hermit and Prince Charles narrating. The film was titled &quot;The Old Man of Lochnagar&quot; in the UK and &quot;The Legend of Lochnagar&quot; in North America. The book was also adapted into a musical stage play. In 1984, Prince Charles read the story on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;. He has also read it in Welsh and Scottish Gaelic translations on television.

In 2007, National Youth Ballet of Great Britain received permission from the Prince of Wales to create a new ballet based on the story. With choreography by Drew McOnie and a commissioned score by Nigel Hess, the ballet received its première at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London on 14 October 2007 and was performed from 24 to 27 October at Leatherhead Theatre in Surrey.

== Plot ==
The book comprises six parts.

===Part One===
The old man loses his grip while attempting to scale the Lochnagar cliff and falls into the loch, where he meets &quot;lagopus Scoticus&quot;, a &quot;freshwater variant of Neptune&quot;. The man and lagopus Scoticus converse using bubbles which display their thoughts in written text and go hunting for &quot;Loch-haggis&quot; in a &quot;sea-rover&quot; underwater vehicle. After the hunt, the old man &quot;feast[s] on Loch-haggis and suffer[s] terribly from wind&quot;, before going to sleep beside the loch.

===Part Two===
The old man wakes up with &quot;a slight hangover&quot;, then sneezes so violently that the force directed into the ground shoots him up into the air. He ends up on top of Lochnagar but is then swept up by a golden eagle that carries him as far as Balmoral, where he bounces on a trampoline before coming to rest. He goes to the fountain and meets Mr Toad, who happens to have tenancy there. The toad offers help and agrees to take the man back to his cave. The man goes to sleep.

===Part Three===
Having slept for &quot;several days&quot; the man wakes and goes to use his specially-designed toilet. The toilet is so designed that bagpipes are played when it is flushed. On the toilet, the man reads books given to him by the Gorms – a race of &quot;friendly little people&quot; who live in &quot;the stone cairns near Lochnagar&quot; – in which they describe their world and promise to invite him to visit &quot;when their research scientists ha[ve] discovered the right formula for a potion which, when drunk, would shrink the old man to the size of the little people&quot;. The man decides to go to Loch Muick and calls &quot;twelve cock capercaillie&quot; towards him. He harnesses them to a carriage and flies to the loch, landing his craft on the water &quot;like a flying boat&quot;. He gives the birds &quot;sugared daddy-long-legs&quot; as a reward. The old man then gets two ospreys called &quot;Skean&quot; and &quot;Dhu&quot; to fish trout from the water for him. The capercaillie, ospreys and the old man all eat the fish together in the evening, exchanging stories until late at night.

===Part Four===
The man risks flying home to his cave by night, and has a few near-accidents on the way. He sleeps a few hours, then receives a letter and package from &quot;a grouse with an evil look in its eye&quot; as he is eating breakfast. It is an invitation to join the Gorms in their cairn; however, the man drinks the bottle without reading the warning on the front and thus has to make his way to the Gorms in a shrunken state, journeying &quot;through giant clumps of heather and gigantic boulders&quot;. A group of Gorms laugh at his struggle as they see him arriving, then also as he slips on the floor upon entering. He descends a flight of stairs to a &quot;vast hall&quot; where the &quot;king of the Gorms&quot; is sitting &quot;[a]t the far end of the room&quot;.

===Part Five===
The man slips as he approaches the king and is once again laughed at by the Gorms. He later discovers that the king wears rubber soles to prevent this happening to him and that the king also wears a &quot;peculiar rubber matt&quot; over his bottom to &quot;prevent him slipping off his throne all the time&quot;. The king gives him a tour of the cairn and its industries. The reader discovers that is the Gorms who manufacture copper and put it on copper beach trees and go out on &quot;heathercraft&quot; to spray heather with a &quot;purple liquid&quot; without which it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be as beautiful and purple as it is&quot;. The man then sees women &quot;milking hind stag beetles&quot;, but accidentally &quot;dilute[s] the special shrinking mixture&quot; in his stomach and begins to grow back to full size. He is rushed out of the cairn before he grows back fully.

===Part Six===
The old man decides to visit London after overhearing the conversations of &quot;people having picnics in the heather&quot;. He boards a train at Ballater, but the train is stopped near Aboyne by cows on the line. The cows are then cleared but the train is impeded again at Aberdeen, whence it can go no further because &quot;heavy falls of snow ha[ve] blocked the line to London&quot;. The man decides to return to Ballater, but sees on the platform a woman dressed entirely in tartan and wearing a &quot;huge hat [...] angrily prodding the station-master with her umbrella&quot;, in protest over the London service&#x27;s cancellation.

The story ends by saying that the old man was secretly rather pleased not to go to London. &quot;He couldn&#x27;t think of anywhere more special to be&quot;, concludes the storyteller, &quot;than to be living at the foot of Lochnagar.&quot;

<text>The [[Border Force]] National Museum (previously - UK Border Agency) is located in Liverpool, England and holds the national collection of HM Revenue and Customs, one of the most important collections of its type held anywhere in the world. Originally HM Customs &amp; Excise National Museum, the collection is now a gallery located on the basement floor of the Merseyside Maritime Museum at the Albert Dock.

The exhibits tell the story of smuggling and contraband from the 18th century to the present day. They include an extensive display of tools of the job, prints, paintings and photographs relating to the work of the UK Border Agency and HM Revenue and Customs. Other items look at the ingenious and often dangerous world of smuggling, prohibited goods and concealment.

==History==
The museum was established in 1994 a partnership between National Museums Liverpool and HM Customs &amp; Excise, which in 2005 merged with the Inland Revenue to form HM Revenue and Customs. The museum was designed to educate the public about smuggling and contraband from 1700s to the present day.

The museum was named as HM Revenue and Customs National Museum in May 2008 (known as &#x27;Seized! Revenue and Customs Uncovered&#x27;) and then became the UK Border Agency National Museum (known as &#x27;Seized! The Border and Customs uncovered&#x27;) following a new lead partnership with the UK Border Agency in 2009. Following the rename of the UK Border Agency in 2012 to Border Force, the museum is now known as &quot;Seized! The Border and Customs uncovered Border Force National Museum&quot;.

Since May 2008 the collection has been located in the basement of Merseyside Maritime Museum. Fraser Randall was chosen to carry out a refurbishment of the exhibition by National Museums Liverpool. The construction company created setworks, interactives, audio visual and graphics works. The exhibition designers updated the collection with the ability for visitor interaction and family-friendly displays. The cost of the refurbishment totalled £500,000.

<text>Lars Erik Ansgar Leijonborg (born 21 November 1949) is a Swedish politician, Minister for Higher Education and Research 2006-2009 and Head of the Ministry of Education and Research 2006–2007. During a ten-year period from 1997 to 2007, he served as chairman of the Liberal People&#x27;s Party ().

He announced on 11 June 2009 that he would be leaving the Cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt as soon as a successor was appointed. He was replaced by Tobias Krantz on 17 June 2009.

== Biography ==
Lars Leijonborg grew up in Solna north of Stockholm. In 1971 he became the leader of the Liberal Youth of Sweden (&quot;Liberala ungdomsförbundet&quot;), the Liberal Party&#x27;s youth organisation. In 1974 he graduated from his studies in social work at Stockholm University. He was party secretary from 1980 to 1983 and editor-in-chief for the party magazine &quot;NU&quot; from 1983 to 1984. After a brief period as a management consultant, he was elected a member of the Riksdag (parliament) in 1985. In 1990 he became the party&#x27;s second deputy chairman. Succeeding Maria Leissner, on 15 March 1997 he was unanimously elected chairman of the party.

In the 1998 parliamentary elections, &quot;Folkpartiet&quot; received 4.7% of the vote, just above the 4% threshold for parliamentary representation. It was the worst election result the party had seen since World War I. Even within the party, Leijonborg&#x27;s position was questioned by many. The youth organisation he once headed openly called for his resignation. Despite the internal opposition, he managed to hold on to his position. And when, in the campaign before the 2002 parliamentary elections, the party suddenly surged after launching a proposal on making a Swedish language test one of the requirements for a naturalized Swedish citizenship, Leijonborg was nicknamed &quot;the Lion King&quot; (&quot;Leijonkungen&quot;) in the tabloids. The election result, 13.3%, was a success for the party and for Leijonborg personally, but since the party&#x27;s centre-right partners failed to gain ground, the Social Democrats could remain in government. In 2006 the party was a part of the Alliance for Sweden, which won the election, although after a scandal where members of the party had hacked into a rival party&#x27;s computer network, the Liberal Party lost almost six percentage points compared to the 2002 election, getting a total of 7.5% of the votes.

On 6 October 2006 Lars Leijonborg was made Minister for Education and Research in the Cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt. On 16 October 2006, Leijonborg temporarily took over the responsibilities for Minister for Culture Cecilia Stegö Chilò, who resigned that day. Eight days later, on 24 October, Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth assumed the post as Minister for Culture.

Leijonborg announced his resignation as party leader on 23 April 2007. He resigned from his post in September 2007. His successor as chairman, Minister for Schools Jan Björklund also took office as the new head of the Ministry of Education and Research. Leijonborg remained in the cabinet, keeping his political assignments as a minister for higher education and research but resigned from the government on 11 June 2009.

Leijonborg is a member of the congregationalist Mission Covenant Church of Sweden ().

<text>Bidston Windmill is situated on Bidston Hill, near Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula, England.

==History==
It is believed that there has been a windmill, on this site, since 1596. 
The mill was ideally placed to catch the wind and was able to produce over of flour every 3 to 5 minutes. However, the mill was difficult to access by cart. The previous structure, a wooden peg mill, was destroyed by fire in 1791 (although some sources state 1793). 
During a gale, the sails got out of control and the friction produced by the revolving wooden mechanism caused the entire mill to burst into flames.

The current building was built around 1800 and continued working as a flour mill until about 1875. 
After falling into disuse the windmill and the land, on which it stands, was purchased by Birkenhead Corporation and restored from 1894.

There is a plaque on the windmill, which reads as follows:

The building was badly damaged in 1927, once again. A public subscription was then raised, in order to carry out the necessary repairs. 
The windmill has been reconditioned several times, since. During 2006, the roof of the windmill was replaced as part of a refurbishment program, in order to maintain the structure.

<doc id="1084467" wikidata="Q379570" url="?curid=1084467" title="Reveille">
<text>&quot;Reveille&quot; ( , ), called in French &quot;Le Réveil&quot; is a bugle call, trumpet call, drum, fife-and-drum or pipes call most often associated with the military; it is chiefly used to wake military personnel at sunrise. The name comes from (or ), the French word for &quot;wake up&quot;.

==Commonwealth of Nations and the United States==
The tunes used in the Commonwealth of Nations are different from the one used in the United States, but they are used in analogous ways: to ceremonially start the day. British Army Cavalry and Royal Horse Artillery regiments sound a call different from the infantry versions, known as &quot;The Rouse&quot; but often misnamed &quot;Reveille&quot;, while most Scottish Regiments of the British Army sound a pipes call of the same name, to the tune of &quot;Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet?&quot;, a tune that commemorates the Battle of Prestonpans. For the Black Watch, since the Crimean War, &quot;Johnnie Cope&quot; has been part of a sequence of pipe tunes played at an extended reveille on the 15th of every month known as &quot;Crimean Long Reveille&quot;.

In modern times, the U.S. military plays (or &quot;sounds&quot;) &quot;Reveille&quot; in the morning, generally near sunrise, though its exact time varies from base to base. On U.S. Army posts and Air Force bases, &quot;Reveille&quot; is played by itself or followed by the bugle call &quot;To the Colors&quot; at which time the national flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel outdoors are required to come to attention and present a salute in uniform, either to the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible. While in formation, soldiers are brought to the position of parade rest while &quot;Reveille&quot; plays then called to attention and present arms as the national flag is raised. When in a vehicle, personnel are expected to stop and render honors. On board U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard facilities, &quot;Reveille&quot; is generally sounded separately from morning colors. &quot;Reveille&quot; is sounded at an earlier time such as 06:00 (6 am), and then the flag is generally raised at 08:00 (8 am) while &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; or the bugle call &quot;To the Colors&quot; is played. On some U.S. military bases, &quot;Reveille&quot; is accompanied by a cannon shot.

In Commonwealth Remembrance Day and Remembrance Sunday services, and ANZAC Day services, &quot;Last Post&quot; begins the period of silent reflection, and &quot;Reveille&quot; ends it. The two tunes symbolize sunset and sunrise respectively, and therefore, death and resurrection. (&quot;Reveille&quot; is often replaced by &quot;The Rouse&quot;, a bugle call commonly mistaken for &quot;Reveille&quot;, although these are actually two different tunes.) Winston Churchill had &quot;Last Post&quot; sounded at his funeral, followed by &quot;Reveille&quot;, as did Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth II.

&quot;To Reveille&quot; or &quot;to sound Reveille&quot; is often used among military personnel as a term meaning &quot;to notify personnel that it is time to wake up&quot;, whether the bugle call is actually sounded or not. Units lacking the personnel or equipment necessary to play the tune will often assign the duty to &quot;sound Reveille&quot; to the last watch of the night, who must ensure that others are roused at the proper time, by any appropriate means (often by actually shouting the word &quot;reveille&quot; until everyone is awake).

The &quot;Reveille&quot; is still played in all the Australian Defence Forces. It was originally played by drums.

===Lyrics===
====Australia====
Although there are no official lyrics to &quot;Reveille&quot;, these unofficial lyrics for the Commonwealth &quot;Reveille&quot; have been recently popularized:

====British====
The first lines of the British Cavalry &quot;Reveille&quot; were for many years rendered as:

The infantry and general &quot;Rouse&quot; ran:

The &quot;Reveille&quot; and &quot;Rouse&quot; are two separate calls which are often confused. The &quot;Reveille&quot; is the first bugle sound of the day to awaken the troops. See the words above, in the Australian section (it is the same as British). The &quot;Rouse&quot; is the second call and, shorter call, sounded after &quot;Reveille&quot; to remind people that they should now be well up and about. On ceremonial occasions, &quot;Rouse&quot; is often sounded instead of &quot;Reveille&quot; because it is shorter and much easier to play. 
&quot;The Goon Show&quot; featured as the introduction of &#x27;Bloodnok&#x27;s Rock and Roll&#x27;, the first four bars of the Revelle in 4/4 time, followed by Secombe: &quot;Company &#x27;shun! Shoulder Arms! From the right...Number!&quot;...

In the Royal Navy, &quot;Reveille&quot; was usually verbalized, preceded by a blast from the bo&#x27;sun&#x27;s call as:
Often, even in modern times, this was extended with other bits and pieces, often a weather report, and sometimes even comical rhymes thought up by the quartermaster. An example heard onboard the frigate in 1979 went thus: &quot;Wakey, wakey, rise and shine, get up, get up, the day is fine, the birds are singing, so why don&#x27;t you? And if you can&#x27;t sing then you know what you can do! Don&#x27;t turn over...Turn Out!&quot; (The quartermaster in question was admonished severely by the officer of the day!!)

====United States====
To the U.S. tune:

Another set of lyrics to the U.S. tune above:

Still another U.S. version goes:

Most famous is Irving Berlin&#x27;s comic adaption of the tune and the lyrics in his 1918 song &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, inspired by his experience as a draftee in the First World War. Recast from the original military 2/4 time to a more swinging 6/8 rhythm, the words

are set to the initial notes of the bugle call, followed by

===Music===
&quot;Reveille&quot; and &quot;Rouse&quot; are composed, like nearly all bugle music, solely from the notes of the major triad, usually notated in C as: C, the tonic; E, the mediant; and G, the dominant.

Both the Commonwealth and United States &quot;Reveilles&quot; can be played with any combination of valves (or all open valves), because they were first played on a bugle, which lacks valves and plays only notes from the harmonic series.
==Australia==
&quot;Reveille&quot; is played as the first call of the day when in barracks. It also concludes the ANZAC day dawn service. &quot;Rouse&quot; is played at the conclusion of silence for other commemorative services.

==Denmark==
The &quot;Reveille&quot; was previously used throughout the Royal Danish Army, but is now only played at sunrise and sunset at the Guard Hussar Regiment barracks, by buglers from the mounted squadron&#x27;s drum and bugle corps. It is also played every morning at the Royal Life Guard barracks in Copenhagen while the flag is hoisted at the garrison.

==Germany==
&quot;&quot; is the wake up call on ships of the German Navy, the . It comes from the Low German word for &quot;rise&quot;. Every day on a German Navy ship starts with a wake-up call, the , which is started by the , a whistle from the boatswain&#x27;s call given 5 minutes before the main wake-up call. The wake-up call is given by a long whistle and the call: (&#x27;Rise, rise, wake up, get your hammock ready&#x27;).

==India==
In the Indian Army, &quot;Reveille&quot; is sounded at 06:00 (or sunrise), and the regimental colours are hoisted. As this also signals the start of the physical training parade, for practical reasons, servicemen must awake prior to the sounding of reveille.

==Ireland==
In the Irish Army, &quot;Reveille&quot; is sounded at dawn and at military wreath-laying ceremonies, as on the National Day of Commemoration.

==Sweden==
In Sweden, &quot;&quot; can be played on bugle, trumpet or drum. Today, it is usually played from a recording. There is also a reveille for military band composed by Johann Heinrich Walch that is used as the reveille of the Swedish Armed Forces.

==United States==
In the U.S. military, Reveille is generally played at 6:30 a.m. as the morning bugle call. It was originally conducted in 1811 as &quot;Troop&quot;, and was designed to muster the unit or for roll call, but later came to mark when the flag was raised in the morning and honors paid to it.

===Boy Scouts of America===
Within the Boy Scouts of America, it is common for &quot;Reveille&quot; to be sounded as a &quot;wake up&quot; for a large encampment of scouts, usually a camporee, jamboree or summer camp. The music may be played over the camp&#x27;s intercom or bugled or trumpeted by the camp bugler. An individual scout unit may also sound &quot;Reveille&quot; to rouse the scouts and scouters on a weekend trip, though this is less common.

Troop Bugler is a position of leadership in some troops.

An instrumental rock version of the melody was recorded as &quot;Reveille Rock&quot; in 1959 by Johnny and The Hurricanes and released on Warwick Records, catalog number M-513. The record charted Billboard number 25 and number 14 in the UK.

<doc id="1084470" wikidata="Q299700" url="?curid=1084470" title="Daniel Dae Kim">
<text>Daniel Dae Kim (born August 4, 1968) is an American actor. He portrayed Jin-Soo Kwon in &quot;Lost&quot;, Chin Ho Kelly in &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, Gavin Park in &quot;Angel&quot;, and Ben Daimio in &quot;Hellboy&quot;. He also provided the voice of Chief Benja in the animated film &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot; (2021) and Johnny Gat in the &quot;Saints Row&quot; video game series. He runs production company 3AD, which produced the television series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Kim was born on August 4, 1968, in Busan, South Korea, to mother Jung Kim and father Doo-tae Kim. He moved to the United States with his family when he was one year old and grew up in New York City, Easton, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Freedom High School in Bethlehem in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania.

In 1990, Kim graduated from Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania with double bachelor&#x27;s degrees in theater and political science. While attending Haverford, he spent the 1989 spring semester studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center. He went on to earn an MFA from New York University&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program in 1996.

==Career==
After graduation, Kim made a name for himself playing numerous roles in a wide variety of television programs. He appeared in &quot;&quot; as a treasury agent as well as episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and &quot;ER&quot;. He was a regular on the short-lived &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spin-off &quot;Crusade&quot; and had recurring roles on &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;24&quot;. He also portrayed Dr. Tsi Chou in a 2008 miniseries based on the acclaimed Michael Crichton novel &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;.

Kim&#x27;s film credits include a Shaolin monk in &quot;American Shaolin&quot; (1992), which enabled him to showcase his skills in Tae Kwon Do. Then came a small part in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) as a scientist working in Doctor Octavius&#x27; laboratory, and the drama &quot;Crash&quot; (2004). He also had minor roles in films such as &quot;The Jackal&quot; (1997), &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; (1999), &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Cave&quot; (2005).

===2004–2010: &quot;Lost&quot; and mainstream prominence===
From 2004 to 2010, Kim served as a regular cast member on the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot;, in which he played Jin-Soo Kwon, a lowly Korean fisherman-turned-hitman who crashes onto a mysterious island with his wife, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim). Since the role required him to speak exclusively in Korean, he said he was forced to quickly relearn the language, which he had not spoken with any great frequency since high school. He would go on to play the character up until the 2010 series finale. Throughout the show&#x27;s run, he, along with his fellow cast members, received numerous accolades, including a 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble. He was individually honored with an AZN Asian Excellence Award, a Multicultural Prism Award, and a Vanguard Award from the Korean American Coalition, all for Outstanding Performance by an Actor. Kim was also named one of &quot;People Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Sexiest Men Alive&quot; in 2005.

Kim provided the voice of the character Johnny Gat for the &quot;Saints Row&quot; video game series, which debuted in 2006. That same year, Kim provided the voice for Metron in the final two episodes of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

Kim played the King of Siam in Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; from June 12–28, 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England. 

In January 2016, it was announced Kim would make his Broadway debut as the King of Siam in Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; from May 3 – June 26, 2016, at the Lincoln Center Theatre in New York.

===2010–2017: &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;===


In February 2010, shortly after &quot;Lost&quot;&#x27;s conclusion, it was announced that Kim would join the CBS reboot &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as Chin Ho Kelly, the role originally made famous by actor Kam Fong. He was the first actor to be officially cast on the show. That series premiered on September 20, 2010, to strong ratings and solid critical acclaim.

He served as a speaker at the 2014 University of Hawaii commencement ceremony.

Kim made his directorial debut with the &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; season five episode &quot;Kuka&#x27;awale&quot;. He departed the show together with Grace Park, the female lead, in late June 2017 prior to the eighth season due to a salary dispute with CBS. They had been seeking pay equality with co-stars Alex O&#x27;Loughlin and Scott Caan, but CBS would not agree to it. It was the first time since the reboot started that the show did not feature any Asian actors in the main cast.

Kim co-starred in &quot;The Divergent Series: Insurgent&quot;, the sequel to 2014&#x27;s &quot;Divergent&quot;, playing Jack Kang, the leader of the Candor faction.

===2018–present: Producing and &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;===

As the founder of the film and television production company 3AD, Kim in January 2014 signed a first-look development deal with CBS Television Studios, the first of its kind with an Asian-American actor. 3AD is currently producing the ABC television series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, based on the 2013 South Korean series of the same name. He is an executive producer on &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; and joined the show during its second season in the role of chief of surgery, Dr. Jackson Han.

In 2019, Kim played the role of Ben Daimio in the reboot film &quot;Hellboy&quot;. He replaced Ed Skrein in the role to avoid a whitewashing controversy, as the character was Asian-American in the original comics. Kim provides the voice of Chief Benja in the Disney animated film &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, which was released in March 2021.

In August and September 2023, he portrayed Francis in the Los Angeles production of &quot;Peter Pan Goes Wrong&quot;.

==Activism==
Kim has voiced concerns about Asian American discrimination in the United States. After testing positive for COVID-19, he spoke out against the xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic, stating: &quot;Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people. ... Yes, I&#x27;m Asian. And yes, I have coronavirus. But I did not get it from China, I got it in America. In New York City. Despite what certain political leaders want to call it, I don&#x27;t consider the place where it&#x27;s from as important as the people who are sick and dying.&quot;

Prior to the 2022 runoff election in Georgia, Kim tweeted about state laws that make it challenging for students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to establish their eligibility to vote, citing VoteRiders as a resource for more information about valid voter ID.

==Personal life==
On June 12, 1993, Kim married Mia Rhee. They have two sons who were born in 1996 and 2002.

During production of &quot;Lost&quot;, Kim and his family split their residency between Los Angeles and Hawaii. He continued his residency in Hawaii after being cast in &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;.

Kim is an avid collector of fine vintage watches. Some of his watches from his personal collection have been featured in some of his films.

<doc id="1084474" wikidata="Q3495297" url="?curid=1084474" title="Toronto—St. Paul's (federal electoral district)">
<text>Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s is a federal electoral district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1935. Before the 2015 election, the riding was known as St. Paul&#x27;s.

The small but densely populated riding covers the area to the north and northwest of Downtown Toronto, often called Midtown Toronto. Prior to the 2006 election, the riding was for forty years a federal “bellwether” riding; always voting for the party that would form the next government. The seat was also a Liberal stronghold for 30 years starting with the 1993 Liberal landslide, and it would continue to vote that way even in the 2011 election, when the party under Michael Ignatieff was reduced to 3rd place for the first time and won only 34 seats nationwide. The streak was broken in a by-election on June 24, 2024, when Conservative candidate Don Stewart won the seat after it was vacated by the resignation of Carolyn Bennett.

The riding has a large Jewish population, currently the fifth-largest in Canada at 10.9 percent behind Thornhill, Mount Royal, Eglinton—Lawrence and York Centre. 

==Geography==
As of 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding includes the southern two-thirds of the wealthy Toronto neighbourhood of Forest Hill, plus the neighbourhoods of Deer Park, Davisville Village, Chaplin Estates, South Hill, Humewood-Cedarvale, the southern two-thirds of Fairbank, and the northern half of Summerhill.

In the last couple of federal elections, the Liberals have been strong throughout the riding, but were particularly strong in middle-class areas such as Fairbank and in Rosehill (a sub neighbourhood of Deer Park). They were also especially strong in Davisville Village in 2019, but this support has dropped. Their weakest neighbourhood in both elections was the more upper-class Forest Hill, which is the strongest neighbourhood for the Conservatives. For the NDP, their strongest neighbourhoods have been Davenport, Tarragon Village and Humewood.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will gain the remainder of Davisville Village from Don Valley West, the area north of the CPR (Moore Park area) in University—Rosedale, and lose the area south of Vaughan Road and west of Winona Drive (in Oakwood Village) to the riding of Davenport. The changes will come into effect in the next Canadian federal election.

==History==

The riding of Toronto—St. Pauls was created in 1933 from parts of the Toronto East Centre, Toronto Northeast, Toronto South and Toronto West Centre ridings.

It consisted initially of the central part of the City of Toronto (&quot;Downtown Toronto&quot;). It was bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by Sherbourne Street and on the north and west by a line drawn from Sherbourne Street west along Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the belt line railway, south and west along the western limit of the city, south along Dunvegan Road, east along St. Clair Avenue, south along Poplar Plains Road, west along Dupont Street, south along St. George and Beverley Streets, east along Queen Street, south along John Street.

In 1947, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by a line drawn from the Bay north along Sherbourne Street, west along Bloor Street East and north along Yonge Street, on the north by the south boundary of Ward Nine of the city of Toronto, and on the west by a line drawn from the Bay north on John Street, west along Queen Street West, north on Beverley Street and along St. George Street, east along Dupont Street, north along Davenport Road and Poplar Plains Road, west along St. Clair Avenue West, north along Dunvegan Road, east and north along the city limit to the southern boundary of Ward Nine.

In 1966, the southern part of the riding, what would be considered to be &quot;Downtown Toronto&quot; was removed from the electoral district (added to Rosedale electoral district) and the riding was shifted northward redefined to consist of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded by a line drawn from Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Elmsthorpe Avenue, west along Eglinton Avenue, north along Castlewood Road, west along Briar Hill Avenue, south along Old Park Road and Glen Cedar Road, southeast along Claxton Boulevard, south along Bathurst Street and east along Bloor Street to Yonge Street.

In 1976, the riding lost its territory south of CP Railway to Spadina, while its eastern boundary was moved to Yonge Street, taking in a chunk of Eglinton, and its western boundary was shifted westward, following (from south to north) Christie Street, St. Clair Avenue, Humewood Drive, the Toronto city limit, Vaughan Road, Eglinton Avenue and the city limit again, taking in parts of York South and Trinity. 

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway line north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north and east along the eastern limit of the City of York, east and north along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Yonge Street and westerly along the CPR line to Ossington Avenue (removing lands between the CPR lands and Bloor Street).

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north along the eastern limit of the City of York, east along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Belt Line (formerly the Canadian National Railway), east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south and east along the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, south along the ravine situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south and east along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Woodlawn Avenue East, south along Yonge Street, and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.

In 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Holland Park Avenue, north along Oakwood Avenue, west along Rogers Road, north along Dufferin Street, east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south along the former eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, southeast along the Don River Tributary situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Jackes Avenue, south along Yonge Street and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.

In the 2012 electoral redistribution, St. Paul&#x27;s lost territory to Don Valley West, gained a small fraction from Davenport and was renamed Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will gain the remainder of Davisville Village from Don Valley West, and the area north of the CPR (Moore Park area) in University—Rosedale. It will lose the area south of Vaughan Road and west of Winona Drive (in Oakwood Village) to Davenport.

=== Churches named for St. Paul in the electoral district ===

From its creation until 1966, the electoral district included two prominent churches named for St. Paul the apostle: St. Paul&#x27;s, Bloor Street at 227 Bloor Street East, which is the largest Anglican church in Toronto by seating capacity; and St. Paul&#x27;s-Avenue Road United Church at Avenue Road and Webster Avenue, which was the church of many of Toronto&#x27;s elite. The electoral district ceased to include 227 Bloor Street East after a redefinition of the district&#x27;s boundaries in 1966. In 1980, the congregation at St. Paul&#x27;s-Avenue Road United Church moved to 427 Bloor Street West during a church merger creating Trinity-St. Paul&#x27;s United Church. The electoral district ceased to include 427 Bloor Street West after a boundary redefinition in 1987. Therefore, Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s no longer contains a St. Paul&#x27;s.

<doc id="1084486" wikidata="Q713427" url="?curid=1084486" title="Ba Maw">
<text>Ba Maw (, ; 8 February 1893 – 29 May 1977) was a Burmese lawyer and political leader, active during the interwar period and Second World War. He was the first Burma Premier (1937–1939) and head of State of Burma from 1942 to 1945.

==Early life and education==
Ba Maw was born in Maubin. He came from a distinguished family of mixed Mon-Burman parentage. His father, Shwe Kye was an ethnic Mon from Amherst (now Kyaikkhami) and well-versed in French and English languages. Thus Shwe Kye served as a royal diplomat who accompanied Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung in the Burmese diplomatic missions to Europe in the 1870s, and worked as an assistant tutor to Royal tutor Dr. Mark at the last royal palace of the last Burmese monarchy. Ba Maw&#x27;s elder brother, Professor Dr Ba Han (1890–1969), was a lawyer as well as a lexicographer and legal scholar, and served as Attorney General of Burma from 1957– 1958. He was brought up as a Christian and later converted to Buddhism to win the favor of Burmese Buddhists.

After an education at Rangoon College, Ba Maw obtained MA degree from the University of Calcutta in 1917. Then he was educated at Cambridge University in England and received a law degree from Gray&#x27;s Inn where he was called to the bar in 1923. He went on to obtain a doctoral degree from the University of Bordeaux, France. Ba Maw wrote his doctoral thesis in the French language on aspects of Buddhism in Burma.

==Academic career ==
After graduating from Rangoon College in 1913, Ba Maw began working as a teacher at Rangoon Government High School and later at ABM school. In 1917, he got an MA from the University of Calcutta, and became the first English lecturer at Rangoon University where he worked for the next four years.

== Law career ==
From the 1920s onwards, Ba Maw practiced law and dabbled in colonial-era Burmese politics. He achieved prominence in 1931 when he defended the rebel leader, Saya San. San had started a tax revolt in Burma in December 1930, which quickly grew into a more widespread rebellion against British rule. San was captured, tried, convicted and hanged. One of the presiding judges that tried San was another Burmese lawyer, Ba U.

Ba Maw acted as the lead counsel for Saya San and other rebel leaders. According to Ba Maw, the government &quot;...under the cloak of judicial trail, went on enforcing the law against thousands of villagers who knew nothing of that law, but only how they were unable to pay their taxes in time, and their homes and villages were wrecked...&quot;

==Politics==

=== British Burma ===
In 1934, Ba Maw served as education minister, and then in 1937, he became premier under the new Burmese constitution. In July 1940, Ba Maw resigned from the Legislature of Burma. During a conference of the Sinyetha, he issued seven orders, one of which was, &quot;to refuse to participate in the war in any way as long as freedom was refused to the Burmese.&quot; On 6 August 1940, he was arrested for violating the Defence of Burma Rules, and taken to Mandalay for trial.

According to Ba Maw, &quot;My trial in itself was a ritual sort of affair, brief and formal and without any touch of drama in it. All the drama was taking place outside [...] where people everywhere had begun to speak with greater racial feeling and defiance.&quot; On 28 August, Ba Maw was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for a year. Originally jailed in Mandalay, he was later relocated to Mogok, in northern Burma.

=== Burma under Japanese Occupation ===
On 13 April 1942, Ba Maw escaped from Mogok during the Thingyan festival. He and his wife Khin Ma Ma Maw hid out in the hills of Mang Lon until the third week in May, when they established contact with the Japanese. On 4 June, during the Japanese occupation of Burma, Ba Maw was made Chief Civilian Administrator, while Aung San agreed to reform the Burmese Independence Army as the Burma Defense Army. On 1 August 1942, Ba Maw was inaugurated as the head of the Burmese government.

As the war situation gradually turned against the Japanese, the Japanese government advanced its previously vague promise to grant Burma independence after the end of the war. The Japanese felt that this would give the Burmese a real stake in an Axis victory in the Second World War, creating resistance against possible re-colonization by the western powers, and increased military and economic support from Burma for the Japanese war effort. A Burma Independence Preparatory Committee chaired by Ba Maw was formed 8 May 1943.

The nominally independent State of Burma was proclaimed on 1 August 1943 with Ba Maw as &quot;Naingandaw Adipadi&quot; (head of state) as well as prime minister. The new state quickly declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, and concluded a Treaty of Alliance with the Empire of Japan. Ba Maw attended the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo in November 1943, where he made a speech speaking of how it was the call of Asiatic blood that drew them together into a new era of unity and peace.

Dissatisfied with him, in 1944 a secret clique within the Imperial Japanese Army made up of Kawabe, Isomura and Ozeki decided to hatch a conspiracy to get rid of Ba Maw and replace him with U Nu. The clique contacted U Nu, but U Nu disagreed with the plan and notified Ba Maw of the plot. Although the conspiracy only involved a few officers and not the entire Imperial Japanese Army, this fact fueled Ba Maw&#x27;s distrust of his Japanese allies. However, he decided to continue collaborating with them until the end of the war because he believed that the priority was to ensure the independence of the British Empire.

During their rule, these Japanese soldiers supported the demonstrations in support of the restoration of the monarchy that took place in Shwedagon. According to Ba Maw, Japanese militarists believed that a puppet monarchy similar to Manchukuo would be easier to manage and better serve their interests. The military viewed Taw Phya Gyi, eldest grandson of Thibaw, last king of Burma, as the favorite candidate to occupy the throne. Taw Payagyi was a young man with no experience or aspirations and no political background, so he was just the kind of easy-to-control nominal Head of State they were looking for.

However, the new state failed to secure popular support or diplomatic recognition due to the continued presence and activities of the Imperial Japanese Army, and after their collaborationist allies, the Burma National Army defected to the Allies side, the government collapsed.

Ba Maw fled just ahead of advancing British forces via Thailand to Japan, where he was captured later that year by the American occupational authorities and was held in Sugamo Prison until 1946. 

=== Independent Burma ===
Ba Maw was allowed to return to Burma, after Burma became independent of the United Kingdom. When he returned to Burma in August 1946, he was invited by Aung San to join the AFPFL and take an important post in the newly independent government, but Ba refused and reorganized the Mahabama Party as an opposition force. He remained active in politics. He was jailed briefly during 1947, on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of Aung San, but was soon released.

After General Ne Win (1910–2002) took over power in 1963, Ba Maw was again imprisoned (like many prominent Burmese of the period who were detained during the time of Ne Win regime, from the 1960s to the 1980s, his imprisonment was without charge or trial) from about 1965 or 1966 to February 1968. During the period of his imprisonment Ba Maw managed to smuggle out a manuscript of his memoirs of the war years, during less than two of which (from 1 August 1943 to March 1945) he was Head of State (in Burmese &quot;naing-ngan-daw-adipadi&quot;, lit. &#x27;paramount ruler of the State&#x27;).

He never again held political office. His book &quot;Breakthrough in Burma: Memoirs of a Revolution, 1939–1946&quot;, an account of his role during the war years, was published by Yale University Press (New Haven) in 1968. In the post-war period he founded the Mahabama (Greater Burma) Party. He died in Rangoon on 28 May 1977.

==Family==
Ba Maw married Khin Ma Ma Maw (13 December 1905 – 1967) on 5 April 1926. The couple went on to have 7 children including Binnya Maw and Tinsa Maw. His daughter Tinsa Maw married Bo Yan Naing of the Thirty Comrades in June 1944.

<doc id="1084487" wikidata="Q6431076" url="?curid=1084487" title="Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center">
<text>The Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center (KOSC), is a public observatory in Vestal, New York opened to the public on June 16, 1974, by the Kopernik Society of Broome County to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus () in 1973. Its mission is to offer hands-on investigations and outreach programs for educating all ages about astronomy and science using advanced optical telescopes, computers and other tools. It is the first science laboratory facility in New York State designed for K-12 teachers, students and their families, and has been one of the best-sited and best equipped public observatories in the Northeast United States for nearly the last 40 years.

==History==

===Original construction===
In 1973, the Kopernik Polish Cultural Society of Broome County organized to build a community observatory to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (). The Society&#x27;s goal was for everyone in the region, regardless of ethnic background, to experience the universe firsthand at the new Kopernik Observatory. The Kopernik Society secured donations of materials, services and funds from the community and planned for construction to begin in the fall of 1973. General Contractor Edward Nezelek, Chairman of the Kopernik Observatory committee, completed the observatory in the spring of 1974. 
The facility, designed by James Kilcy, consisted of a astronomical observatory with two telescope domes.

After the Observatory was opened to the public on June 16, 1974, the Kopernik Society donated the facility to the people of the Southern Tier region, to be operated by the Roberson Museum and Science Center as the Roberson-Kopernik Observatory, part of Roberson&#x27;s educational initiative and to complement the major planetarium already in operation at its Binghamton site.

===Major expansion===
With major support from the Kopernik Society, the Decker Foundation, and many other community organizations, Roberson undertook a $2 million expansion of the Observatory to create the Kopernik Space Education Center in 1992. It would convert the Roberson-Kopernik Observatory into the first science laboratory facility in New York State designed for K-12 teachers, students and their families. The envisioned expansion would add a third equatorial room with a large telescopes, four classrooms, a space science theater, and laser physics and computer-imaging laboratories. Construction of the Center began in the Fall of 1992, Kenneth R. Gay II was the Architect, and the facility addition opened in June 1993.

The Kopernik Society and the Roberson Museum hosted a grand 25th anniversary celebration event on June 5, 1999, at the Kopernik Space Education Center. The celebration showcased Kopernik&#x27;s facilities, programs, and the partnership with the Polish community that made it all possible. The 25th anniversary guests included scientists, NASA officials, long time supporters and students from Kopernik Talent Search programs. The event highlighted the growth of the Kopernik facility from a local observatory into a science education center of national significance.

===Financial troubles===
Fortunes changed by 2005 when the Kopernik Space Education Center operated at a $45,000 loss. 
The Roberson Museum and Science Center, under severe financial strain, was seriously considering cutting major funding and programs at the Observatory while continuing its summer program and Friday night astronomy sessions in 2006.

The funding changes concerned the Kopernik Society of Broome County and supporters of the Observatory.

The Kopernik Society conducted months of negotiations out of which an agreement was reached that returned ownership and operation of the Kopernik Space Education Center from the Roberson Museum back to the Kopernik Society in March 2007.

The name of the center changed to the Kopernik Observatory and Science Education Center and it needed to generate about $54,000 each year from federal / state grants, fund-raisers, and company / public donations. Under the transfer agreement Kopernik had to balance its operating budget through 2011, otherwise Roberson could resume control of the facility.

===Independent operation===
The name was changed again to Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center.
Celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2014 with a grand gala at the Binghamton University campus. Windsor native and Former NASA Astronaut Douglas H. Wheelock was the keynote speaker.

===Observatory Directors===
* Richard DeLuca, (1973–1975)
* Richard Aguglia, (1975–1981)
* Vacant (1981)
* E. Jay Sarton, (1982–1996)
* Carol Stowell (1996–1999)
* Kristen Gordon (2006–2011)
* Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Deskur, (2011 (interim), 2012–present)

==Programs and services==
Its mission is to offer hands-on investigations and outreach programs for educating all ages about astronomy and science using advanced optical telescopes, computers and other tools. It is the first science laboratory facility in New York State designed for K-12 teachers, students and their families and has been one of the best-sited and best equipped public observatories in the Northeast United States for nearly the last 40 years.

The Observatory is a member of the Association of Science-Technology Centers and participates in the ASTC Passport Program. The Passport Program allows members of a participating institution to visit other participating institutions for free, provided the member is visiting an institution more than 90 miles from their home institution.

===Public programs===
The Observatory holds public events every Friday evening, but due to changing seasonal sunsets times the Observatory adjusts its program starting times; March–May at 8:00 pm, June–July at 8:30 pm, August–November at 8:00 pm, December–February at 7:00 pm. Friday evening topics include Optical Astronomy, Radio Astronomy, Technology, and related subjects.

There are a number of special events that are held throughout the year.

====Winter Star Party====
The annual Winter Star Party, held since 2006, is usually on the last Saturday in January. Doors open at 6 pm and programs are held regardless of sky conditions. There are typically several speakers on various astronomy topics or brave the cold and see winter constellations, along with the Moon, Jupiter, the Orion Nebula, and much more through the Observatory&#x27;s large telescopes.

====RocketFest====
The RocketFest has been held every June since 2008. Rocket building workshops will run every 3 hours starting at 9 a.m. and ending at 6 pm. Assistance is available to help assemble the model rocket, prepare the engine, and launch the rocket. Reservations are necessary to hold a place in one of the workshops and to pre-order the type of rocket including Standard rockets (A- or B-powered), suitable for younger children and beginning rocket builders, and Advanced rockets (D-powered) have stronger engines and are appropriate for those with more experience.

====AstroFest====
Kopernik AstroFest is a celebration of the night sky and amateur astronomy held annually in October since 1982. The 3-day event is sponsored jointly by the Observatory and the Kopernik Astronomical Society. AstroFest includes speakers on a variety of topics, demonstrations, an amateur astronomy roundtable discussion, the Kopernik AstroFest Solar Star Party, and nightly observing if skies are clear. Overnight non-fire camping is allowed on the facility grounds for an additional nominal cost.

====Moonlight Café====
On selected Saturday evenings in the Spring and Fall the main building of KOSC is transformed into a Moonlight Café. It is an adults-only evening where one can enjoy fresh-brewed coffee, tea, and delicious desserts along with a fascinating introduction to the stars and outer space. Registration is through SUNY Broome&#x27;s Continuing Education Program.

===School programs===
The Observatory offers opportunities for students of all ages to experience a range of science, technology, engineering and math topics, known as STEM education. Classes run through the school year, on weekends and school holidays at the facility in addition to bringing programs directly to schools for individual classrooms or the entire school. The programs are aligned with mesh with New York State Department of Education and Pennsylvania Department of Education standards so they supplement what&#x27;s being taught in the classroom.

====Link Summer STEM exploration camps====

Since 1992 the Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center (KOSC) has offered week-long camps for students in grades 1–12. The camps are sponsored by the Link Foundation since 1994, in memory of local inventor / explorer Edwin A. Link, the Link Summer STEM Exploration camps offer hands-on, high-tech adventures in science, technology, engineering, and math. Students housed at Binghamton University with commuter and residential options are available.

Starting after the July 4 weekend, the Observatory offers week-long summer camps and day camps for students in grades one through 12. The camps are sequenced so that each year a student can come back and learn something new.

====Summer science day programs====
* Young Scientists (grades 1 &amp; 2)
* Junior Astronomers (grades 3 &amp; 4)
* Earth Science (grades 5 &amp; 6)
* Young Engineers: (grades 2 &amp; 3)
* Junior Engineers: (grades 4 &amp; 5)
* Master Engineers: (grades 5 &amp; 6)

==Facilities and equipment==
The Observatory is the first science laboratory facility in New York State designed for K-12 teachers, students and their families and has been one of the best-sited and best equipped public observatories in the Northeast United States since its founding. The facility contains multiple types of equipment to support its primary mission.

===Optical telescopes===
The observatory has three main optical telescopes:
* E. Jay Sarton Telescope in the eastern equatorial room is a f/12 &quot;Super Planetary&quot; Refractor manufactured by Astro-Physics of Machesney Park, Illinois, USA, which uses a G11 equatorial mount from Losmandy of Los Angeles, California. The telescope is dedicated to former Observatory Director E. Jay Sarton.
* Broome County Telescope in the western equatorial room is a f/11 &quot;C14&quot; Schmidt–Cassegrain reflector manufactured by Celestron of Torrance, California, USA, which uses a Celestron CGE Computerized German Equatorial Mount. The telescope was donated in 1987 to the Observatory as &quot;A gift from the people of the Southern Tier&quot;. 
* KAS Telescope in the southern equatorial room is a f/8 Ritchey–Chrétien reflector and German equatorial mount manufactured by Optical Guidance Systems of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, US. The telescope was donated by the Kopernik Astronomical Society. It is one of the largest publicly usable telescopes in New York State. 
* The Robert &quot;Barlow Bob&quot; Godfrey Heliostat is mounted in the main building&#x27;s physics laboratory/classroom. It is basically two mirrors angled just right to reflect light into an f/12 refractor telescope that runs about down through the ceiling and projects the solar image projected as a diameter white-light image onto the classroom wall. The mirrors track the sun through electric servo motors. The telescope was dedicated in 2014 to Robert A. &quot;Barlow Bob&quot; Godfrey.

There are a number of other telescope available for use including four Orion Newtonians, one Meade Newtonian, and twelve f/4.2 Astroscan aluminized and overcoated borosilicate glass parabolic primary mirror with a focal length of . A SBIG STL-1301E CCD camera is also available.

===Amateur radio station===
The Kopernik Observatory &amp; Science Center has a permanent amateur radio station using the club call sign: K2ZRO. The station is often open during public programs on Friday evenings. The call sign K2ZRO belonged to Kazimierz Deskur, one of the founding members of the Kopernik Society, who built the Kopernik Observatory. Deskur heard some of the first signals from Sputnik, and this led to his interest in amateur radio satellites (the facility has an original Sputnik QSL card). He was an early pioneer in amateur radio satellites and developed a device called the OSCARLocator, a great circle map-like device to aid hams in tracking them.

==Location and climate==
The facility is located atop a hill in Vestal, New York, southwest of Binghamton, New York within the Allegheny Plateau. The site lies on the western ridge line of the Choconut Creek, part of the Susquehanna River Basin, a few hundred feet north of the New York – Pennsylvania border. The surrounding area is a product of significant glaciation that has removed any sharp relief of the hills seen in other unglaciated areas of the plateau. The tops of the hills in the area, including where the Observatory is located, approximate the level of a peneplain that was uplifted to form the plateau.

The Observatory is located in a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), characterized with cold, snowy winters and warm, wet summers. The surrounding region is the 10th rainiest area in the United States, with 162 rainy days a year. With 212 cloudy days annually, it is also the seventh cloudiest city in the country, and the cloudiest east of the Rocky Mountains.

==Associated organizations==

===Kopernik Astronomical Society===
The Observatory is also the home of the Kopernik Astronomical Society (KAS), a group of dedicated observational astronomers. The Kopernik Astronomical Society&#x27;s (KAS) mission is to provide the Binghamton, NY area with resources to those who are interested in astronomy, space, and science collaboration. This is accomplished by providing support for the Kopernik Observatory and Science Center through volunteerism, hosting public outreach events, education programs, and by sharing experiences and information to anyone who might have a question. In addition to outreach, the KAS embarks on adventures for astronomical observation through field trips to dark sky parks, conferences, star parties, as well as observation sessions at Kopernik Observatory.

The Society meets the 1st Wednesdays of each month. Meetings start at 7 pm and last about one hour, followed by observing (if clear). These meetings consist of an overview of next month&#x27;s events, equipment issues, and observing tips.

===Binghamton Amateur Radio Association===
The Binghamton Amateur Radio Association, Inc. (BARA), founded in 1919, has a rich history of technical achievements, community service and having fun in just about all aspects of amateur radio. It holds a Club Call of W2OW from the FCC. General meetings are open to all, club members and non-members alike, and are held on the Third Wednesday of every month, starting at 7 pm at the Kopernik Observatory.

<doc id="1084490" wikidata="Q208425" url="?curid=1084490" title="Michael Bradley (soccer)">
<text>Michael Sheehan Bradley (born July 31, 1987) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a midfielder. He is currently an assistant coach at Norwegian club Stabæk.

The son of soccer coach Bob Bradley, Michael began his professional career in Major League Soccer with the MetroStars in 2004. He then spent several years in Europe, playing in the Dutch Eredivisie with Heerenveen, German Bundesliga with Borussia Mönchengladbach, English Premier League with Aston Villa, and Italian Serie A with both Chievo and Roma. He returned to MLS with Toronto FC in 2014, making over 300 total appearances and lifting the MLS Cup as captain in 2017, before retiring with the club in 2023.

A former captain of the United States national team, Bradley made over 150 international appearances between his senior debut in 2006 and 2019. He was selected to the squad for several major tournaments, including five CONCACAF Gold Cups and two FIFA World Cups, winning two of the former. He was also a member of the sides that finished runners-up at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and reached the semi-finals of the Copa América Centenario.

==Early life==
Bradley was born in Princeton, New Jersey, son to Bob Bradley, former coach of the United States national team and Los Angeles FC. While his father was the head soccer coach at Princeton University, the family lived in Pennington, New Jersey.

Michael spent his teenage years in Palatine, Illinois while his father coached the Chicago Fire of Major League Soccer (MLS), and he grew up playing for Sockers FC, who went to the 2002 National Championships and finished third. He later attended the United States Under-17 Men&#x27;s National Team Residency Program in Bradenton, Florida – the dedicated facility for the training of the under-17 national team – for four semesters, from 2002 to 2004. As a child, he idolized Roy Keane, a renowned midfielder for Manchester United and the Republic of Ireland.

==Club career==

===MetroStars===
Before leaving Bradenton, Bradley signed a Project-40 contract with MLS, turning professional at the age of sixteen, and entered the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected thirty-sixth overall by the MetroStars, who at the time were coached by his father. Bradley did not see any playing time in his rookie season, missing out with a foot injury, but went on to gain a starting spot in 2005, playing 30 out of 32 matches for the Metro. Just weeks after his father was fired as the club&#x27;s coach, he headed in his first professional goal in a victory over Chivas USA on the last day of the 2005 season, sending the team to the playoffs.

===SC Heerenveen===
In January 2006, Bradley became the youngest MLS player to ever be sold when he was transferred to Heerenveen for $250,000 and a portion of any sell-on fee His first start for the Dutch club came on April 16, 2006, in a match against AZ. He found success early, earning five starts and helping the club to a coveted UEFA Cup spot in his first half-season. Upon the retirement of Paul Bosvelt after the 2006–07 season, Bradley took the veteran&#x27;s starting place in central midfield. Bradley scored sixteen Eredivisie goals and twenty in all competitions during the 2007–08 season.

In January 2008, Bradley broke the record for the most goals scored in a single season by an American soccer player playing in a European first division, which was previously held by Brian McBride with his thirteen goals for Fulham in the Premier League. On January 26, 2008, Bradley extended his record to eighteen, with sixteen league goals.

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===
====2008–2011====

On August 31, 2008, Bradley signed a four-year deal with Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach for an undisclosed fee. It was later revealed that Bradley had agreed to a switch to English club Birmingham City on the condition that the club retained its Premier League status. However, they did not and he made his Gladbach debut on September 20 in a loss against Hertha Berlin. On November 15, 2008, Bradley scored his first goal for Mönchengladbach against Bundesliga powerhouse Bayern Munich with an eighty-first minute equalizing header. The game ended 2–2.

Early in the 2009–10 season, Bradley was briefly suspended after an argument with manager Michael Frontzeck over playing time. However, the two later reconciled and Bradley re-established himself as a starter with the club before assisting a goal against Bayern Munich with a one-touch volley pass, and scoring the winning goal on a low free kick against Hannover 96. On January 30, 2011, Aston Villa of the Premier League confirmed via their official website that they were in talks to sign Bradley on a loan deal until the end of the 2010–11 season.

====Loan to Aston Villa====
Bradley completed the loan deal to Aston Villa on January 31, 2011. Bradley was paraded in front of the fans at Villa Park on February 5 before kick off of the Premier League match against Fulham. On February 12, Bradley made his Aston Villa debut, coming on in the second half after Jean Makoun was sent off. It was said that Bradley would not join Villa on a permanent basis after Alex McLeish declined to extend his contract. He made only three Premier League appearances and one FA Cup appearance.

===Chievo===
Bradley joined Italian Serie A club Chievo on August 31, 2011. He made his Chievo debut on September 18, coming on in the second half for Paolo Sammarco. He has been nicknamed &quot;The General&quot; by the local fans. Bradley scored his first goal in Italian soccer in a 3–2 victory over Catania on April 7 to take his side up to ninth in the league standings.
===Roma===
On July 16, 2012, Bradley joined Roma, signing a four-year contract for a transfer fee of €3.75 million. The following day, he made his debut for Roma as a starter in a 2–1 pre-season victory against Austrian Bundesliga club Rapid Wien, going head-to-head with fellow U.S. international Terrence Boyd. On July 25, Bradley scored his first goal for his new club in a friendly against Liverpool at Fenway Park in Boston. On August 19, Bradley scored his second pre-season goal against Greek club Aris. On August 26, Bradley made his league debut as a starter for Roma in their 2–2 draw against Catania; he picked up the assist in Roma&#x27;s game-tying goal in the 90th minute. On October 7, in his first game back after a month-long groin injury, Bradley scored his first goal for the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; in Roma&#x27;s 2–0 win over Atalanta.

In late January 2013, Bradley received praise from freelance writer for ESPN.com Michael Cox, stating that Serie A were choosing midfielders like Bradley who &quot;epitomize[d] the new breed of Serie A midfielder, who&#x27;s all about energy and hard running, rather than the typical number 10.&quot; On May 26 of that year, Bradley started in midfield for Roma as the club fell 1–0 to Rome rivals Lazio in the final of the Coppa Italia.

On September 6, Bradley was sidelined due to an injury he suffered on national team duty against Costa Rica. He returned to action for Roma on October 27, where he scored a goal against Udinese, the only goal either side scored during the match.

===Toronto FC===

On January 9, 2014, Roma announced the sale of Bradley to Toronto FC of Major League Soccer for $10 million. As part of the transfer, the two clubs agreed to a partnership including two friendly matches at BMO Field over six years, and a player development program for Toronto FC players at Roma&#x27;s training facility.

Bradley made his debut with Toronto in their season opener at Seattle Sounders FC on March 15, 2014, the game ended in a 2–1 away victory with both goals coming from newly acquired Jermain Defoe. He scored his first goal for Toronto three weeks later on April 5 against the Columbus Crew, a game which ended in a 2–0 away victory.

He was named captain prior to the 2015 season.

Bradley captained and scored once for Toronto FC in the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals in a derby against Montreal Impact in which Toronto won on an aggregated score of 7–5, to take Toronto FC to the MLS Cup Final for the first time in their history. On December 10, 2016, Toronto lost the final at home to Seattle Sounders FC 5–4 in penalty shoot-out following a goalless draw after extra-time in which Seattle had no shots on target; Bradley missed Toronto&#x27;s second penalty.

The arrival of Spanish playmaker Victor Vázquez in midfield at the beginning of the 2017 season saw less of a burden placed on Bradley and star forward Sebastian Giovinco to create goalscoring opportunities for Toronto; furthermore, Greg Vanney&#x27;s switch in tactics from a 4–4–2 diamond to a 3–5–2 formation often saw Bradley occupy more of a supporting role in midfield, which left the Spaniard free to take on the majority of playmaking duties, although the midfield duo often switched positions and effectively shared the team&#x27;s defensive and creative responsibilities, forming a notable partnership throughout the season. On June 27, Toronto defeated Montreal 2–1 at home in the second leg of the 2017 Canadian Championship final to capture the title for the second consecutive season, edging Montreal 3–2 on aggregate. On September 30, 2017, Bradley won his first Supporters&#x27; Shield with a 4–2 home win over New York Red Bulls, to clinch top of the league with the most points that season. On December 9, 2017, Bradley helped Toronto defeat Seattle 2–0 in the 2017 MLS Cup at BMO Field, to lift the title for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, and complete an unprecedented domestic treble.

After a 2–1 home loss to Guadalajara on April 18, in the first leg of the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League Finals, Toronto managed a 2–1 away win in the return leg on April 25, which took the match straight to penalty shoot-out; Bradley missed the decisive spot kick as Toronto lost the shoot-out 4–2.

On March 2, 2019, Bradley scored a brace for Toronto in their 3–1 win away against Philadelphia Union to kick off Toronto FC&#x27;s regular Major League Soccer season. He made his 200th appearance for the club on November 10, a 3–1 away defeat to Seattle Sounders in the 2019 MLS Cup Final.

At the beginning of 2020, he had ankle surgery and was expected to miss a significant portion of the season. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic interrupting the MLS season, he only missed two games and was able to return upon the league restart in the MLS is Back Tournament.

In 2022, Bradley scored a brace against Charlotte FC in a 4–0 home win that saw the debuts of Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, both of whom assisted on Bradley&#x27;s goals. The performance led Bradley to be voted MLS Player of the Week.

On October 17, 2023, Bradley announced that he would retire from professional soccer following Toronto FC&#x27;s season-ending match held four days later.

==International career==
In May 2006, Bradley was brought into the United States national team&#x27;s training camp prior to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. While not a member of the World Cup squad or an alternate, Bradley was on the roster for the three send-off friendlies played before the tournament. He earned his first cap in the May 26 match against Venezuela in Cleveland.

In late 2006, Bob Bradley, Michael&#x27;s father, was hired as head coach of the national team, and Michael would establish himself as a key player for the U.S. during his father&#x27;s tenure. Bradley earned his first international start on March 28, 2007, during a friendly against Guatemala. He was a starter at the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup and helped lead the U.S. to the title, though he was sent off for a late tackle in their semi-final win against Canada. The next month, he started every match for the U.S. at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where he scored the game-winning goal in the 107th minute against Uruguay in the round of 16. He scored his first senior international goal on October 17, 2007, with a game-winner in the 87th minute against Switzerland in a friendly in Basel. Following these performances, Bradley was named U.S. Soccer&#x27;s Young Athlete of the Year for 2007. On February 11, 2009, facing Mexico in Columbus for a 2010 World Cup qualifier, Bradley scored both goals of a 2–0 U.S. victory.
During the United States&#x27; surprise run to the final of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, Bradley scored the second goal against Egypt off an assist from Landon Donovan, helping the Americans advance to the semi-final on goal differential after beating the Egyptians 3–0. He started in the 2–0 upset victory against Spain in the semi-finals, but was sent off late in the game. The resulting suspension kept Bradley out of the tournament final, which the U.S. lost 3–2 to Brazil. Bradley was later reported to have confronted referee Jorge Larrionda following the match, resulting in him receiving an additional three-match suspension to be served during the 2009 Gold Cup.

Bradley was a key player for the U.S. at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, starting all four matches in central midfield. In the group stage, he scored the equalizer in a comeback 2–2 draw against Slovenia. He captained the national team for the first time in an August 10, 2010 friendly against Brazil, played in his birthplace of New Jersey. At the 2011 Gold Cup, Bradley featured in each game, forming a new midfield partnership with Jermaine Jones, and scored the opening goal in the final against Mexico, though the Americans went on to lose 4–2.

Following the Gold Cup loss, Bob Bradley was fired as national team coach and replaced by Jürgen Klinsmann, under whom Michael remained a key starter in midfield. He started each game for the U.S. as they reached the last 16 at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. After Clint Dempsey had his captaincy removed as punishment for a controversial incident with a referee, Klinsmann named Bradley the national team&#x27;s new permanent captain ahead of the 2015 Gold Cup. In the United States&#x27; opening tournament game against Honduras on July 7, Bradley earned his 100th international cap at the age of 27. Bradley would also captain the U.S. as they hosted the centennial Copa América in 2016, reaching the semi-finals.

Although not initially included in the final squad for the 2017 Gold Cup, Bradley would be one of six alternate players later added to the U.S. roster for the knockout stage. Bradley went on to play every minute of the United States&#x27; three knockout games, lifting his second Gold Cup title after they defeated Jamaica in the final. For his performances, Bradley was awarded the Golden Ball, recognizing him as the best player of the tournament.

Bradley was a mainstay of the United States&#x27; 2018 World Cup qualification campaign, and would score the opener in a crucial match against Mexico at the Azteca Stadium on June 11, 2017, chipping an effort over goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa from roughly 40 yards out to help the Americans earn a 1–1 draw. However, after a shock defeat to Trinidad and Tobago on October 10, the United States failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Bradley was one of several senior players to receive extensive criticism from American media and fans, citing his subpar performances and a lack of leadership shown as captain of the team. After returning to club duty with Toronto FC, both Bradley and fellow national teammate Jozy Altidore would routinely be booed and jeered by opposition fans when playing MLS games in American stadiums.

On July 7, 2019, Bradley played the full 90 minutes as the U.S. lost the final of the 2019 Gold Cup by a single goal to Mexico. The match made him the third American to reach 150 international caps, after Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan. Bradley made his final appearance for the national team on October 15, 2019, in a 2–0 loss to Canada in Nations League.

==Style of play==
A hard-working, intelligent, and physically imposing right-footed player, Bradley was capable of playing in several midfield roles, and was used in the center, in a holding role, in a box-to-box role, in the hole, or even in a more withdrawn creative role as a deep-lying playmaker. He was also utilized as a central defender on occasion. Bradley&#x27;s tenacity, ball-winning abilities, energy, tactical intelligence, and positional sense enabled him to recover the ball and quickly transition from defense to attack by making forward runs, while his vision and range of passing allowed him to dictate the tempo of his team&#x27;s play in midfield or create goalscoring opportunities after retrieving possession. In addition to his stamina and playing ability, he was also known for his communication and leadership skills.

==Coaching career==
On October 23, 2023, Stabæk Fotball announced that Bradley would become an assistant coach. He reunited with his father, who was head coach of the club at the time.

==Personal life==
Bradley speaks fluent English, Italian, Dutch, German, and Spanish. He is married to Amanda, a former University of Rhode Island tennis player. The couple have a son and a daughter, born in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Bradley&#x27;s father, Bob, managed sides including the United States men&#x27;s national team and Toronto FC for a brief period while his son was captain of the club. Scott Bradley, the younger brother of Bob and uncle of Michael, played as a catcher in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Seattle Mariners, and served as long-time coach of the Princeton Tigers. Michael Bradley&#x27;s sister married the Australian-born soccer player Andy Rose.

<doc id="1084519" wikidata="Q574639" url="?curid=1084519" title="Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League">
<text>The Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL) was a broad popular front that ruled Burma (now Myanmar) between 1947 and 1958. It included both political parties and trade unions as members. 

The league evolved out of the anti-Japanese resistance organization Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO) founded in August 1944 during the Japanese occupation by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), the Burma National Army and the socialist People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (PRP). The AFO was renamed AFPFL in March 1945.

An AFPFL delegation under the leadership of Aung San led the negotiations for independence in London in January 1947. After winning the elections of April 1947 for a Constitutional Assembly, the AFPFL leadership drafted the new constitution for a sovereign Burma. It initially included a Marxist faction led by Thakin Than Tun, but they were purged from the party in October 1948.

The AFPFL determined Burma&#x27;s post-independence politics and policies until June 1958, when the party split into two factions, the Clean AFPFL and the Stable AFPFL.

==History==
===Fight for independence===
The origins of the league go back to the clandestine anti-Japanese resistance organization AFO that was founded by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) led by Thakin Soe, the Burma National Army (BNA) led by Aung San, and three socialists from the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (PRP), Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Chit, and Ba Swe in August 1944. The AFO was renamed Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League at a meeting held from 1–3 March 1945. The name change indicated that the aim of the organization was both to liberate Burma from the Japanese and achieve independence.

The communist leaders Thakin Soe and Thakin Than Tun served as first president respectively general secretary of the league. Personal issues led to Thakin Soe&#x27;s ouster from the CPB and consequently to his absence at the first post-war conference of the AFPFL held at the Naythurain theater on the Kandawgyi Lake from 16 to 19 August 1945 in Rangoon. Aung San chaired the conference and eventually superseded Thakin Soe as president of the AFPFL.

Dissent and ideological rifts with the communists over leadership and strategy in the independence struggle began soon to emerge within the league. Thakin Soe, after splitting from the CPB and forming the Red Flag Communist Party, started a rebellion in 1946. Though the CPB, dubbed the White Flag Communists, continued to co-operate with the AFPFL, its leader Thakin Than Tun resigned as general secretary in July 1946 after contentions with Aung San and other AFPFL leaders, and was replaced by the socialist Kyaw Nyein. When Aung San accepted in September 1946 the British governor&#x27;s invitation to lead the Executive Council and became the de facto premier of Burma, the communists accused him of having sold out to the British and settled for a &quot;sham independence&quot;. In November, the CPB was officially expelled from the AFPFL.

In January 1947, Aung San and other AFPFL leaders such as Thakin Mya, Tin Tut, and Kyaw Nyein negotiated in London the independence for Burma. The British however made independence contingent upon the agreement of Burma&#x27;s major ethnic minorities. Therefore, Aung San and other AFPFL colleagues among them Aung Zan Wai, Pe Khin, Bo Hmu Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Myoma U Than Kywe and Sein Mya Maung took part in the Panglong Conference in February 1947 and convinced representatives from the Shan, Kachin, Chin and Kayah to support the negotiations for independence and join the future independent state of Burma.

General elections for a constitutional assembly were held in April 1947, which the AFPFL won amidst an election boycott by the opposition, taking 173 of the 210 seats and running unopposed in over fifty constituencies. Aung San headed the constitutional assembly and was set to become Burma&#x27;s prime minister, but was assassinated together with six other members of his cabinet on 19 July, a date commemorated as Martyrs&#x27; Day. U Nu succeeded Aung San as leader of the AFPFL and Premier of Burma.

===Independence and civil war===
Burma declared independence from Britain in January 1948, and the CPB went underground the following March after U Nu ordered the arrest of its leaders for inciting rebellion. Other groups also soon dropped out of the AFPFL to join the rebellion, not only the White-band faction of the People&#x27;s Volunteer Organisation (PVO) formed by Aung San as a paramilitary force out of the demobbed veterans, but also a large part of the Burma Rifles led by communist commanders calling themselves the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA). The AFPFL government had plunged into civil war with not only Burman insurgent groups but also ethnic minorities including the Karen National Union (KNU), Mon, Pa-O, nationalist Rakhine and the Mujahideen of Rakhine Muslims.

The first post-independence general elections were held over several months in 1951 and 1952, with the AFPFL and its allies winning 199 of the 250 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

===Parliamentary rule and split===
Although the AFPFL was returned to office again in the 1956 elections, the results came as a shock as the opposition left-wing coalition, known as the National United Front (NUF) and led by Aung Than, older brother of Aung San, won 37% of the vote and 48 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

By 1958, despite an economic recovery and the unexpected success of U Nu&#x27;s &quot;Arms for Democracy&quot; offer that saw the surrender of a large number of insurgents, most notably the PVO, the AFPFL had become riven with internal splits, which worsened following the party&#x27;s congress in January 1958. In July 1958 it formally split, with one group led by Prime Minister U Nu, which he named the &quot;Clean AFPFL&quot;; the other was led by Kyaw Nyein and Ba Swe and was known as the Stable AFPFL.

The majority of AFPFL MPs were supporters of the Stable faction, but U Nu was able to narrowly escape defeat in parliamentary motion of no-confidence by only eight votes with the support of the opposition NUF. Still dogged by the &quot;multicoloured insurgency&quot;, the army hardliners feared the communists being allowed to rejoin mainstream politics through Nu&#x27;s need for continued support by the NUF, and was compounded by the Shan Federal Movement lobbying for a loose federation. The volatile situation culminated in a military caretaker government under General Ne Win that presided over the 1960 general elections, which were won by U Nu&#x27;s Clean AFPFL.

Following the restoration of multi-party democracy after the 8888 Uprising, two new parties were established using the AFPFL name, the AFPFL (founded 1988) and the AFPFL (Original). Both contested the 1990 elections, but received less than 0.05% of the vote and failed to win a seat.

==Policies==
The league with its different political parties and mass and class organizations was held together by the common leadership of first Aung San and then U Nu. During its time in office, the AFPFL pursued a nationalist policy based on unity and consensus, upheld parliamentary democracy and presided over a mixed economy comprising both state and private enterprise. It spent most of this period in its history fighting several communist, socialist and ethnic separatist rebel groups for control over the future of the country. It also fought a successful war against Nationalist Chinese (KMT) forces who occupied the far north of the country for several years after the KMT&#x27;s defeat by the Chinese Communist Party. Its foreign policy followed strict neutrality supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955, shunning the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) on account of the American support of the KMT on one hand, and facing the communist insurgencies on the other.

<text>Tablet was a bi-weekly alternative newspaper in Seattle, Washington published from 2000 to 2005. &quot;Tablet&#x27;s&quot; focus was on the music, arts, politics and culture of the Pacific Northwest.

==History==
Founded by co-op of writers and publishers, its first issue came out on October 1, 2000. The paper began as a bi-weekly newspaper with a print run of 20,000. It was distributed for free at rock clubs, record stores, galleries and similar businesses, as well as to newsstands and newspaper boxes. Distribution included the Northwest cities of Seattle, Portland, Spokane, Bellingham, Tacoma, Bellevue, Vancouver and Olympia. Its main rivals were the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Stranger&quot;. In the &quot;Utne Reader&#x27;s&quot; 2001 Alternative Press Awards, &quot;Tablet&quot; won the Reader&#x27;s Choice award for &quot;Best New Title.&quot; Guest writers for &quot;Tablet&quot; included Margaret Cho and Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D.

In March 2004, the paper&#x27;s owners De Kwok, Eric Hildebrandt, Dan Halligan and Sarah Sherman, relaunched the paper as a monthly glossy covered magazine. The magazine was higher profile than the newspaper and included more fashion and music coverage. &quot;Tablet&quot; worked extensively with the Rat City Rollergirls, Bumbershoot, the Seattle Erotic Art Festival, Vain, Three Imaginary Girls, the Seattle Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, KEXP, Seattle Art Museum, Henry Art Museum, Seattle International Film Festival, Seattle Public Libraries, Roq La Rue, Richard Hugo House, Grand Illusion Cinema, I Heart Rummage, Home Alive, the Independent Media Center and most of Seattle&#x27;s alternative music venues. &quot;Tablet&quot; folded in September 2005 after its 103rd issue.

<text>Ian Joseph Somerhalder ( ; born December 8, 1978) is an American retired actor. He is known for playing Boone Carlyle in ABC&#x27;s science fiction adventure drama television series &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010) and Damon Salvatore in the CW supernatural teen drama series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; (2009–2017).

==Early life==
Somerhalder was born on December 8, 1978, in Covington, Louisiana, United States. His mother, Edna (), is a massage therapist of Choctaw and Irish descent originally from Mississippi, while his father, Robert Somerhalder Sr., is an independent building contractor of Cajun descent. Somerhalder is the second of three children, with an older brother and a younger sister.

Somerhalder graduated from Saint Paul&#x27;s School, a private school in Covington. He embarked on a modeling career from age 10 to 13. Somerhalder&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 14, and he subsequently lived with his mother. At age 17, Somerhalder decided to refocus on acting and began studying with acting teacher William Esper.

==Career==

In the summer of 2000, Somerhalder starred in the short-lived WB series &quot;Young Americans&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. He played Hamilton Fleming, the son of the dean of a prestigious boarding school. In 2002, Somerhalder played bisexual character Paul Denton in Roger Avary&#x27;s adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; novel, &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, alongside James Van Der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon, and Jessica Biel.

In 2004, Somerhalder scored his breakthrough role when he played Boone Carlyle in &quot;Lost&quot;. Despite his character&#x27;s death in the twentieth episode of the first season, he returned to the role of Boone for seven more episodes between 2005 and 2010, including the series finale. He was the first major character to die. Following his departure from the show, ABC signed him to another one-year contract. In 2005, he stated that being a part of &quot;Lost&quot; was &quot;the greatest experience&quot; of &quot;the greatest year of his life&quot;.

In 2009, Somerhalder appeared in the movie &quot;The Tournament&quot; where he played the role of an assassin participating in a lethal competition with other assassins. He appears in the coffee table book &quot;About Face&quot; by celebrity photographer John Russo. Also in 2009, Somerhalder began playing the role of Vampire Damon Salvatore as a series regular in The CW television drama series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. The series premiere attracted The CW&#x27;s highest premiere ratings of any season premiere since the network began in 2006. The series has continued to be the highest-rated series on its channel with both his performance and the show receiving a positive response from critics. He began directing &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; in its third season and produced the series at the start of season 8. He received several Teen Choice Award&#x27;s and a People&#x27;s Choice Award for his participation on the series.

Somerhalder acted in the short subject &quot;Time Framed&quot; (2013). He played Dr. Luther Swann as a series regular in the Netflix science fiction horror series &quot;V Wars&quot;, which ran from 2019 to 2020.

In 2020, Somerhalder shot footage for and served as an executive producer on the film &quot;Kiss the Ground,&quot; a documentary centered on regenerative agriculture. He returned as an executive producer on its follow-up documentary, &quot;Common Ground&quot;, in 2023. 

In a 2024 interview, Somerhalder revealed that he had retired from acting a while back after relocating outside of Los Angeles, though he would still be involved in producing and environmental activism.

==Foundations and causes==
Somerhalder was involved in the cleanup after the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil drilling disaster on April 22, 2010. His efforts included cleaning of oiled wildlife and taping public service announcements to let the public know how they could help. Somerhalder also supports the St. Tammany Humane Society, an organization for animal shelter and welfare. On November 13, 2010, he hosted a Bash on the Bayou charity fundraiser for the Society. During the event, Somerhalder was presented with a donation of $11,100 by &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; fandom for his birthday project.

Together with his &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; co-stars Candice Accola and Michael Trevino, Somerhalder supports the It Gets Better Project, which makes it a goal to prevent suicide among LGBT youth associated with The Trevor Project. For his second campaign, Somerhalder teamed up with &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; co-star Paul Wesley to release a limited edition shirt designed by a fan, with the words &quot;Blood Brothers Since 1864.&quot; This campaign sold almost 10,000 shirts.

On December 8, 2010, Somerhalder&#x27;s 32nd birthday, he launched the &quot;Ian Somerhalder Foundation&quot; which he hopes will educate people on the importance of protecting the environment and animals: &quot;Instead of gifts this year, my birthday wish is that we come together and raise funds to support projects that protect our habitat and nurture our furry friends. To spread awareness for his foundation, Somerhalder sponsors and often walks in Mardi Paws, a parade and organization held in his hometown of Covington. He opposes GMO foods and factory farming, and supports ecologist Allan Savory in his crusade to let cows graze in sync with nature to enrich soil, enhance biodiversity, and reverse climate change. In 2011, Somerhalder visited Savory in Africa and announced he was making a documentary about him with the goal of winning him a Nobel Prize.

Somerhalder is also a celebrity campaigner for RYOT, a Los Angeles-based media company known for RYOT.org, its cause-based, take action online news source.

==Personal life==
Somerhalder dated his &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot; co-star Nina Dobrev from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, he began dating actress Nikki Reed. They married on April 26, 2015, in Malibu, California. They had a daughter in 2017 and a son in 2023.

While working on &quot;Lost,&quot; Somerhalder and Maggie Grace adopted a feral cat named Roo which they found &quot;literally dying&quot; in the jungle on the set, which later became Grace&#x27;s &quot;travel buddy.&quot; Somerhalder had stated that being a part of &quot;Lost&quot; was &quot;the greatest experience&quot; of &quot;the greatest year of his life&quot;. Somerhalder has remained close friends with his former &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot; co-star Paul Wesley, and in 2020, they announced the launch of a straight bourbon whiskey named Brother&#x27;s Bond Bourbon.
