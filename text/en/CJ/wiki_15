<text>USS &quot;Haddo&quot; (SS-255), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the haddo.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Haddo&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 21 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Charles F. Russell, and commissioned on 9 October 1942.

==Atlantic war patrols, April – July 1943==
After conducting shakedown off New England, &quot;Haddo&quot; departed New London 9 April 1943 to patrol the shipping lanes to Rosneath, Scotland. She arrived 30 April and joined Submarine Squadron 50 (Subron 50), which was assigned to patrol off Norway and Iceland and stand ready in case of a breakthrough of the German fleet from Norway. When it became clear after three patrols that targets were scarce in this region, &quot;Haddo&quot; and her sister submarines were sent back to the United States.

==Fourth–sixth war patrols, November 1943 – July 1944==
&quot;Haddo&quot; returned to New London 29 July 1943 and steamed via the Panama Canal to Mare Island, Calif. Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, she reached Pearl Harbor 25 November and put to sea 14 December on her fourth war patrol, in Philippine waters. The submarine made few contacts and terminated the patrol at Fremantle, Australia, 4 February 1944.

Sailing from Fremantle 29 February, &quot;Haddo&quot; embarked on her fifth war patrol in waters off Borneo, Java, and Indochina. After a disappointing attack 8 March in which two torpedoes exploded prematurely, she made an attack on a tanker and escort 14 March which produced unconfirmed results. Moving to the Indochina coast, she sank a small craft with gunfire the night of 23 March and damaged freighter &quot;Nichian Maru&quot; 29 March before returning to Fremantle 22 April 1944.

&quot;Haddo&quot; departed Fremantle 18 May 1944 to conduct her sixth war patrol in the East Indies. After suffering an air attack off Morotai 30 May, she sighted heavy smoke and proceeded to investigate. The smoke was a lure that concealed a Japanese patrol boat. After evading this one, &quot;Haddo&quot; encountered six more of the smoking lures. &quot;Haddo&quot; sank two small craft 11 June and scouted the Tawi Tawi anchorage on 14 June. Shortly thereafter she was detected by a patrol airplane and pursued for almost 10 days. Her sixth war patrol was terminated 16 July at Fremantle.

==Seventh war patrol, August – October 1944==
For her seventh war patrol &quot;Haddo&quot; joined a coordinated attack group with five other submarines to cruise Philippine waters. Japanese convoys ventured into the Palawan area with strong air cover during the day, but usually anchored with escort protection for the night.

Learning from that a convoy had been attacked by 4 days before and trailed to Paluan Bay, the submarines closed for the attack. As the convoy headed out to sea before daylight 21 August, &quot;Ray&quot; sank one transport while the escort vessels pursued &quot;Harder&quot;. At this point &quot;Haddo&quot; entered the fray, launched six torpedoes at three targets, and dived to avoid air attack. Over one hundred depth charges churned the sea, but &quot;Haddo&quot; had already sunk cargo ships &quot;Kinryu Maru&quot; and &quot;Norfolk Maru&quot;.

Next day &quot;Haddo&quot; followed &quot;Harder&quot; in for an attack on a small convoy with escorts, and &quot;Haddo&quot; succeeded in sending escort ship &quot;Sado&quot; to the bottom. Following a lone destroyer and awaiting her opportunity. &quot;Haddo&quot; was suddenly turned upon by the Japanese ship. She launched a four-torpedo spread &quot;down the throat&quot; of the destroyer, which veered off and headed for Manila.

Cruising off Cape Bolinao 23 August, the submarine was about to torpedo a tanker close to shore when she detected a pursuing destroyer. With four torpedoes she ripped off the warship&#x27;s bow. &quot;Haddo&quot; then maneuvered to finish off her antagonist, but her last torpedo missed. Despite the efforts of two Japanese trawlers and another destroyer, &quot;Asakaze&quot; soon sank, giving &quot;Haddo&quot; another kill.

Diverting to New Guinea to refuel and rearm, &quot;Haddo&quot; continued her seventh war patrol. She sank a sampan 8 September and 21 September found a convoy and maneuvered into position ahead of it. While turning to avoid a destroyer, &quot;Haddo&quot; lost depth control, and was not able to regain it in time to effectively attack the cargo ships. She subsequently headed for Subic Bay, and lifeguard duty, but on the way detected a hospital ship (&quot;Takasago Maru&quot;) and survey ship in company. Disregarding the former, she sent the survey ship, &quot;Katsuriki&quot;, to the bottom.

On 22 September, while serving on lifeguard station in Subic Bay,&quot;Haddo&quot; rescued Hollis Hills, a US Navy pilot shot down by antiaircraft fire. Hills was an American who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force before the United States entered the war, after which he joined the USN. Notably, while flying an RCAF P-51 Mustang over France in 1942, he had become the first P-51 pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft.

&quot;Haddo&quot; returned to Fremantle 3 October 1944. For this outstanding patrol the submarine received the Navy Unit Commendation.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols, October 1944 – July 1945==
&quot;Haddo&quot; returned to the waters off Manila for her eighth war patrol. Departing Fremantle 20 October she sank oiler &quot;Hishi Maru No. 2&quot; on 9 November, Serving as lifeguard boat for aircraft, she was credited with sinking &quot;No.3 Kyoei Maru&quot; on 6 December 1944, (but postwar accounting showed the target was only damaged) before terminating her eighth war patrol at Pearl Harbor 27 December. From there she was sent to Mare Island shipyard for much-needed repairs, arriving 5 January 1945.

&quot;Haddo&quot; departed on her ninth war patrol 16 May 1945. Cruising the East China and Yellow Seas, she attacked a convoy emerging from the fog 1 July and quickly sank a small coastal defense vessel (Type D escort ship &quot;CD-72&quot;) and cargo ship, &quot;Taiun Maru No. 1&quot;. Clearing the area, she heard automatic gunfire, and soon saw a frigate bearing down hard upon her. &quot;Haddo&quot;&#x27;s skipper decided not to dive and instead turned on a parallel but opposite course, and the frigate shot by with her guns blazing. &quot;Haddo&quot; suffered little damage, and was able to avoid a companion escort and finally reach deep water. That evening she sank two sailing junks and then set course for a new station off Port Arthur. She sank a trawler 3 July, survived a furious depth charge attack by patrol vessels, and proceeded to Guam arriving 16 July 1945.

==Post-war==
&quot;Haddo&quot; departed on her 10th and last war patrol 10 August 1945 but it was soon terminated by the surrender of Japan. She then headed for Tokyo Bay, where she witnessed the signing of the surrender on board the battleship and departed for home. Touching at Hawaii, &quot;Haddo&quot; arrived at Panama 28 September and New London 6 October 1945. Decommissioning 16 February 1946, &quot;Haddo&quot; was kept in reserve until her name was stricken from the Navy List 1 August 1958. She was sold for scrap 30 April 1959 to Luria Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia, Pa.

In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Haddo&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service. Her fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth war patrols were designated successful.

<doc id="1083645" wikidata="Q992460" url="?curid=1083645" title="Himno de Riego">
<text>The &quot;Himno de Riego&quot; (&quot;Anthem of Riego&quot;) is a song dating from the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot; (1820–1823) of Spain and named in honour of Colonel Rafael del Riego, a figure in the respective uprising, which restored the liberal constitution of 1812. The lyrics were written by Evaristo Fernández de San Miguel, while the music is typically attributed to José Melchor Gomis.

It was declared the national anthem of Spain in 1822, remaining so until the overthrow of the liberal government the next year in 1823, and was also one of the popular anthems used in the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874) and, with much more prominence, the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). It continued to be used by the Second Republican government in exile until it was dissolved in 1977 upon the end of the Francoist Spanish State in 1975.

== History ==
The &quot;Himno de Riego&quot; was written between 31 January and 6 February 1820 in the town of Algeciras by Evaristo Fernández de San Miguel, lieutenant colonel of the flying column headed by Rafael del Riego, who had previously rejected another text by Antonio Alcalá Galiano.

It was declared the official national anthem of Spain on 7 April 1822 when the Cortes Generales approved the corresponding decree, which was signed by King Fernando VII in Aranjuez two days later and finally published in the &quot;Gaceta de Madrid&quot; on 14 April. However, the liberal government was overthrown and the constitution repealed by Fernando VII in October 1823, with the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; resuming its role as the national anthem.

In the First Republic of 1873 to 1874, part of the greater 1868–1874 Sexenio Democrático achieved by the overthrow of Isabella II in the Glorious Revolution, the anthem occupied a discreet position; the most popular anthems used at this time were &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and the &quot;Himno de Garibaldi&quot;. However, by the time of the Second Republic of 1931 to 1939, the anthem had once again gained popularity to the point of becoming the primary institutional representative of the government during this period.

Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;Himno de Riego&quot; was never declared the official anthem of the Second Republic. According to one opinion, it can be deduced that the republicans did not consider the 1822 declaration of the song as the national anthem superseded or repealed.

== Lyrics ==

=== Original lyrics (1820–1823) ===
The following is the original version used during the &quot;Trienio Liberal&quot; (1820–1823).
=== First short version (1931–1939) ===
The following is the version used during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). It consisted of verses one, three and seven of the original version, with a few minor lyrical changes.
=== Second short version ===
The following version consists of the first and last verses of the original, with a few minor lyrical changes.
==Satirical lyrics==

This alternative version was extremely popular amongst Spaniards, particularly in Catalonia, during the Spanish Civil War. The rudeness of the lyrics reflects the dislike of Republican Spain for the church and the monarchy. After the war, these lyrics continued to be sung by Franco&#x27;s detractors and enemies.

&lt;poem lang=&quot;es&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;(Spanish)
Si los curas y frailes supieran,
la paliza que les van a dar,
subirían al coro cantando:
&quot;¡Libertad, libertad, libertad!&quot;

(Spanish)
Si los Reyes de España supieran
lo poco que van a durar,
a la calle saldrían gritando:
&quot;¡Libertad, libertad, libertad!&quot;

(Catalan)
La Reina vol corona?
Corona li darem...
que vingui a Barcelona
I el coll li tallarem!

(Spanish)
Un hombre estaba cagando,
y no tenía papel,
pasó el Rey Alfonso XIII
¡Y se limpió el culo con él!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt; 
If priests and monks knew;
the beating they&#x27;re going to receive,
they&#x27;d make a chorus and sing:
&quot;Liberty, liberty, liberty!&quot;
If the Kings of Spain knew
how little they&#x27;re going to last,
they&#x27;d go out on the street and sing:
&quot;Liberty, liberty, liberty!&quot;
The queen wants a crown?
We&#x27;ll give her a crown...
Let her come to Barcelona
And we&#x27;ll cut her head off!
A man was pooping
But had no paper.
King Alfonso XIII came by
So he wiped his ass with him.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;es&quot;&gt;&quot;Spanish translation of Catalan verse&quot;
¿La reina quiere corona?
Corona le daremos
que venga a Barcelona
¡Y el cuello le cortaremos!&lt;/poem&gt;

== Incidents involving the incorrect use of the anthem ==

=== 1952 Cusco Cathedral bell dedication ceremony ===
Che Guevara claims that, when the famous bell of the Cusco Cathedral in Peru was rededicated at the expense of the Francoist Spanish government after a 1950 earthquake, the bell was made to play the Spanish national anthem, which then erroneously played the Himno de Riego, to the consternation of attending Spanish officials.

=== 1968 European championship controversy ===
On October 1, 1967, during the qualifying stage for the European championship in Prague, the &quot;Himno de Riego&quot; was performed by mistake instead of the then official anthem of Spain &quot;Marcha Real&quot;.

=== 2003 Davis Cup controversy ===
At the 2003 Davis Cup finals held in Australia, James Morrison performed &quot;Himno de Riego&quot; instead of Spain&#x27;s current national anthem, the &quot;Marcha Real&quot; (Royal March). Australian tennis officials claimed there was an error on the CD provided to the musician, but Spanish sport authorities still issued an official protest.

== Notes ==

: 1.Used by the Government in Exile until its dissolution in 1977.

<text>Patricia Ann Ruth Noble (3 February 1944 – 23 January 2021) was an Australian singer and actress. Initially performing as Patsy Ann Noble, she was a teenage pop singer in the early 1960s, with regular appearances on the Australian music and variety television series &quot;Bandstand&quot;. In November 1961, she released her biggest hit single, &quot;Good Looking Boy&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in Melbourne and Top 20 in Sydney. At the 1961 Logie Awards, she won the Best Female Singer of the Year award from &quot;TV Week&quot;. By 1962, she had transferred to the United Kingdom and continued her singing career by releasing singles there. 

In 1965, Noble started her television acting career, and by 1967, she was using Trisha Noble as her stage name. By the 1970s, she had relocated to the United States and had guest roles on various television series including &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;. In 1983, Noble returned to Australia where she expanded into a career as a theatrical actress.

In 2005, Noble had a minor role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; as Jobal Naberrie, the mother of lead character Padmé Amidala, and thus the maternal grandmother of characters Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.

==Early life and family==
Patricia &quot;Trisha&quot; Ann Ruth Noble was born on 3 February 1944 in Marrickville and grew up in Sydney, Australia. Her father was Clarence Lancelot &quot;Buster&quot; Noble (1 March 1913 – 15 July 1990), a comedian and singer; her mother was Helen De Paul (born Helen McGoulrick, 1921–2007), an entertainer, singer, dancer, and comedian on the Tivoli circuit. During World War II, Buster served as a sergeant in the Waratahs Entertainment Unit in the AIF from November 1942 to January 1946. Noble has a younger sister, Amanda. In 1950, Noble appeared onstage with her parents and had her own radio programme. By age 14, she was qualified to teach ballet.

==Music career==
Noble rose to fame as a teenage singing star in the 1960s under the name Patsy Ann Noble. Her singing career was encouraged by Brian Henderson, the compere of the Australian version of &quot;Bandstand&quot;, where she made regular appearances. She was signed to the Australian HMV Records and released her first single &quot;Like I&#x27;m in Love&quot; / &quot;I Love You So Much It Hurts&quot; in November 1960. She became good friends with a young Peter Allen, who had formed the successful Allen Brothers with Chris Bell, and released one of his compositions &quot;Busy Lips&quot; in January 1961. However, it was not until Johnny Devlin, a New Zealand singer-songwriter, handed her the lyrics of &quot;Good Looking Boy&quot; in November 1961 that she had her first Top 10 hit in Melbourne. &quot;Good Looking Boy&quot; was also top 20 in Sydney, but did not chart internationally. It was released in the United Kingdom, but did not reach the Top 100.

Noble won the &#x27;Best Female Singer of the Year&#x27; Logie Award for 1961, presented by &quot;TV Week&quot;. By December 1962, Patsy Ann had scored herself two No. 1 and four Top 10 singles in Australia. In 1962, she travelled to London where she was given a two-year contract with Columbia Records. There, she released many &quot;girl group&quot;-sounding pop songs including &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; (February 1963), &quot;I&#x27;m Nobody&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1963), and &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; (1963), but received little commercial success – although she continued to score hits between 1963 and 1965 in Australia. In 1963, she appeared in the British musical film &quot;Live It Up!&quot; (with music produced by Joe Meek), although only in a singing role. In June 1965, Noble released &quot;He Who Rides a Tiger&quot; which peaked at No. 21 on the British Top 30, and No. 15 on Australia&#x27;s Top 40.

During the 1960s, Noble released six albums in Australia and one in England, the most popular being &quot;The Blonde Bombshell&quot; (1961) which received an award for most outstanding vocal performance on an album. 

==Acting career==
In the second half of the 1960s, she turned to acting and made her dramatic screen debut in a 1965 BBC television production entitled &quot;The Snowball&quot;, and soon found herself appearing on other television series, including the 1966 &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode &quot;Not So Jolly Roger&quot; (in which her recording &quot;He Who Rides a Tiger&quot; was featured), &quot;Callan&quot; (1970, &quot;The Same Trick Twice&quot;) with Edward Woodward, and films such as &quot;Death Is a Woman&quot; (1966), in which Noble had a lead role as the femme fatale), and &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969).

After 1967, Noble had changed her name to Trisha Noble in order to distance herself from her years as a teen singer. She relocated to the United States beginning in 1971 and appeared in films and television series. She guest-starred on &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; as Sabrina, a superhuman thief in the episode &quot;Cruise Ship to the Stars&quot;. In a guest appearance on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in 1976, she played a female reporter who tries to seduce Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) during the episode &quot;Ted&#x27;s Temptation&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; (series 1) as high priestess of the Vestal Virgins.

In 1975, Noble appeared in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Playback&quot;, in which she meets the murderer (played by Oskar Werner) in an art gallery wearing a low-cut dress. She was cast by the director who had spotted her in a party wearing the same dress. In 1976–77, she had the ongoing role of Yvonne Holland on the soap opera &quot;Executive Suite&quot;, and appeared in the 1977 television miniseries &quot;The Rhinemann Exchange&quot; and &quot;Testimony of Two Men&quot;. In 1979, she featured on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; as Odette Lependieu in the two-part episode &quot;Never Send a Boy King To Do a Man&#x27;s Job&quot;.

In 1980, Noble played the role of heiress Phyllis Morley in the mystery comedy film &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; starring Tim Conway and Don Knotts. Another ongoing role was as Detective Rosie Johnson on the police drama &quot;Strike Force&quot; (starring Robert Stack) on ABC in 1981–82. She also appeared in Season 4 of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; as Laela.

Soon after &quot;Strike Force&quot; was cancelled, Noble returned to Australia in 1983 with her son Patrick because her father, Buster, was seriously ill. She re-established a career there as a theatrical actress. In 1986, she appeared in the television miniseries &quot;Body Business&quot;. In 2002, Noble filmed a small role as Padmé Amidala&#x27;s mother (and thus the maternal grandmother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa), Jobal Naberrie, in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; which was cut from the final film – but included on the DVD release. Noble briefly reprised the role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; in 2005. In 2003 Trisha Noble played the role of Ellie Greenwich&#x27;s &quot;Ma&quot; to critical acclaim in &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; at &quot;The Star&quot; in Sydney, showcasing both her comic onstage genius as well as her vocal range, never failing to bring the audience to tears with her stunning rendition of &quot;Look of Love&quot;. She continued to perform on the live stage and, as of 2007, appeared with the new National Music Theatre Company, Kookaburra, in their premiere season of &quot;Pippin&quot; as Berthe at the Sydney Theatre.

==Death==
Noble died on 23 January 2021, at the age of 76, after what was described as an 18-month battle with mesothelioma.

<text>A tintype, also known as a melanotype or ferrotype, is a photograph made by creating a direct positive on a thin sheet of metal, colloquially called &#x27;tin&#x27; (though not actually tin-coated), coated with a dark lacquer or enamel and used as the support for the photographic emulsion. It was introduced in 1853 by Adolphe Alexandre Martin in Paris. It competed with both the ambrotype process and the older and established daguerreotype, finding particular adoption in North America. Tintypes enjoyed their widest use during the 1860s and 1870s, but lesser use of the medium persisted into 1930s and it has been revived as a novelty and fine art form in the 21st century. It has been described as the first &quot;truly democratic&quot; medium for mass portraiture.

Tintypes were particularly used for portraits. They were at first usually made in a formal photographic studio, like daguerreotypes and other early types of photographs. At the time though the process like the professional were called specifically &quot;ferrotype&quot; and &quot;ferrotypist&quot; respectively (not &quot;photograph|er&quot;). Later on tintypes were most commonly made by ferrotypists working in booths, tents, or the open air at fairs and carnivals, as well as by itinerant sidewalk photographers (with carts or wagons). Because the lacquered iron support was resilient and later did not need drying, a tintype could be developed and fixed and handed to the customer only a few minutes after the picture had been taken.

The tintype saw the Civil War come and go, documenting the individual soldier and horrific battle scenes. It captured scenes from the Wild West as it was easy to produce by itinerant photographers working out of covered wagons. They captured farming families in front of their new home (&quot;house portraits&quot;), emerging towns as well as the frontier landscape, for which large plates were used.

It began losing artistic and commercial ground to higher quality albumen prints on paper in the mid-1860s, yet survived for well over another half century, living mostly as a carnival novelty. The tintype&#x27;s immediate predecessor, the ambrotype, was done by the same process of using a sheet of glass as the support. The glass was either of a dark color or provided with a black backing so that, as with a tintype, the underexposed negative image in the emulsion appeared as a positive. Tintypes were sturdy and did not require mounting in a protective hard case like ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.

== Technical details ==

There are two historic tintype processes: wet and dry. In the wet process, a collodion emulsion containing suspended silver halide crystals had to be formed on the plate just before it was exposed in the camera while still wet. Chemical treatment then reduced the crystals to microscopic particles of metallic silver in proportion to the intensity and duration of their exposure to light, resulting in a visible positive image. The later prefabricated, hence more convenient dry process was similar but used a gelatin emulsion which could be exposed in the camera dry.

In both processes, a very underexposed negative image was produced in the emulsion. Its densest areas, corresponding to the lightest parts of the subject, appeared gray by reflected light. The areas with the least amount of silver, corresponding to the darkest areas of the subject, were essentially transparent and appeared black when seen against the dark background provided by the lacquer. The image as a whole therefore appeared to be a dull-toned positive. This ability to employ underexposed images allowed shorter exposure times to be used, a great advantage in portraiture.

To obtain as light-toned an image as possible, potassium cyanide was normally employed as the photographic fixer. It was perhaps the most acutely hazardous of all the several highly toxic chemicals originally used in this and many other early photographic processes.

To overcome the uniqueness of each picture multi-lensed cameras and single-lens cameras with a movable back holding the plate were invented. Three men from Boston are to name here. John Roberts first made use of multiple lenses, mounting as many as 32 of them on one camera. A twelve-lensed camera for example, developed in 1858, made a dozen so-called &quot;gem&quot; portraits with one exposure. A patent for a movable plate holder was registered by Albert S. Southworth in 1855. In 1860 both methods were combined in patents by Simon Wing, who promoted these cameras successfully and tried to enforce licensing, but failed with the Supreme Court ruling his patents invalid due to their use prior to his patents. Portrait sizes ranged from gem-size to . From about 1865 to 1910, the most popular size, called &quot;Bon-ton&quot;, ranged from to .

Each tintype is usually a camera original, so the image is usually a mirror image, reversed left to right from reality. Sometimes the camera was fitted with a mirror or right-angle prism so that the result would be right-reading.

== History ==
The process was first described by Adolphe-Alexandre Martin in France in 1853. In 1856 it was patented by Hamilton Smith in the United States and by William Kloen in the United Kingdom. It was first called &quot;melainotype&quot;, then &quot;ferrotype&quot; by V. M. Griswold of Ohio, a rival manufacturer of the iron plates, then finally &quot;tintype&quot;. 

=== Ambrotype as a precursor ===
The ambrotype was the first use of the wet-plate collodion process as a positive image. Such collodion glass positives had been invented by Frederick Scott Archer in 1851. Although it is a widely held belief James Ambrose Cutting might have named the process after himself, in actuality, &quot;ambrotype&quot; was first coined by Marcus Aurelius Root, a well known daguerreotypist, in his gallery as documented in the 1864 book &quot;The Camera and the Pencil&quot;.

The tintype was essentially a variant of the ambrotype, replacing the latter&#x27;s glass plate with a thin sheet of japanned iron (hence &quot;ferro&quot;). Ambrotypes often exhibit some flaking of their black back coating, cracking or detachment of the image-bearing emulsion layer, or other deterioration, but the image layer on a tintype has proven to be typically very durable, although the iron support might oxidize at its corners.

=== Success of the tintype ===

Compared to their most important predecessor, the daguerreotype, tintypes were not only very inexpensive, they were also relatively easy and quick to make. A photographer could prepare, expose, develop and varnish a tintype plate and have it ready for the customer in a few minutes. Although early tintypes were sometimes mounted in protective ornamental cases, like daguerreotypes and ambrotypes, uncased tintypes in simple paper mats were popular from the beginning. They were often transferred into the precut openings provided in book-like photograph albums like the later prints on cardboard.

One or more hardy, lightweight, thin tintypes could be carried conveniently in a jacket pocket. They became very popular in the United States during the American Civil War. Although prints on paper (&quot;see&quot; cartes de visite and cabinet cards) soon displaced them as the most common type of photograph, the tintype process continued to enjoy considerable use throughout the 19th century and beyond, especially for casual portraiture by novelty and street photographers. In contrast to the considerable amount of manuels, books and articles in journals on the different photographic processes, they were seldomly treating the ferrotype. Whereas Edward M. Estabrooke stated in his almost unique extensive monograph &quot;The Ferrotype and How to Make It&quot;, published in 1872, that the amount of ferrotypes taken would probably surmount the production of all other techniques combined. His book and the introduction of low cost variants known as &quot;Gem ferrotypes&quot; and the invention of the photo booth in 1888, helped to sustain the tintype&#x27;s longevity.

=== Contemporary usage ===
John Coffer, as profiled in a 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, travels by horse-drawn wagon creating tintypes.

In 2013, California Air National Guard member and artist Ed Drew took the first tintypes in a war zone since the Civil War, when he photographed Air Force pilots serving in the Afghan War.

The contemporary photographer Victoria Will created a series of tintypes of Hollywood stars at the 2014 and 2015 Sundance Film Festivals, including portraits of Anne Hathaway, Nick Cave, and Ewan McGregor. The portraits were later published as a book.

Organisations such as the penumbra foundation still continue to use this technique, offering tintype photography sessions. Their work has been featured in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

<text>Monrad Charles Wallgren (April 17, 1891September 18, 1961) was an American politician who served as the 13th governor of Washington from 1945 to 1949, as well as representing that state in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.

Wallgren, of Swedish descent, was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1891. His family moved to Texas in 1894 and then to Everett, Washington in 1901. He attended public schools and business college in Everett, graduating from the Washington State School of Optometry in Spokane, Washington in 1914. He worked in retail jewelry and optometry from 1915 to 1932, as well as serving in the Washington National Guard from 1917 to 1919 and 1921 to 1922. He was an outstanding player of carom billiards.

In 1932, Wallgren ran for election to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. He defeated incumbent Republican Albert Johnson, and took office in the 73rd United States Congress on March 4, 1933. Near the end of his fourth term in 1940, Wallgren ran for United States Senate to replace fellow Democrat Lewis B. Schwellenbach, who was retiring to accept a judicial nomination. Wallgren won the election, and was also appointed to finish the rest of Schwellenbach&#x27;s term. He took office on December 19, 1940.

While Wallgren served portions of two different terms (the end of Schwellenbach&#x27;s and the one that Wallgren was elected to), he served less than 6 years in the Senate. In 1944, he successfully ran for Governor of Washington against incumbent Republican Arthur B. Langlie, resigning from the Senate on January 9, 1945 to serve as governor from then until 1949. He was defeated for re-election as governor by Langlie in 1948, and was nominated by President Harry Truman as the chairman of the National Security Resources Board. That nomination was later withdrawn, and Wallgren served as chairman of the Federal Power Commission in 1950 and 1951. He then retired from public service.

In 1961, Wallgren died of complications resulting from a traffic accident.

<doc id="1083662" wikidata="Q197698" url="?curid=1083662" title="Craig Levein">
<text>Craig William Levein (born 22 October 1964) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who was most recently the manager of Scottish Premiership club St Johnstone.

During his playing career he played for Cowdenbeath and Heart of Midlothian, making over 300 league appearances for Hearts until he was forced to retire due to injury. He also won 16 caps for Scotland and was part of their 1990 FIFA World Cup squad.

After retiring as a player Levein became a manager, working at club level for Cowdenbeath, Heart of Midlothian, Leicester City, Raith Rovers and Dundee United. Levein was appointed Scotland manager in 2009, but he left this position after the team failed to win any of its first four matches in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. He returned to Hearts in 2014 as director of football, then served as their manager from August 2017 to October 2019. After a spell advising Brechin City, Levein was appointed St Johnstone manager in November 2023, before being relieved of his duties in September 2024.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Levein was born in Dunfermline and attended Inverkeithing High School, where he was in the football team alongside another future Scottish international footballer, Gordon Durie. He was a supporter of Raith Rovers. His early football career saw him turn out for Dalgety Bay, Leven Royals and Inverkeithing under-16s. At the age of 15, however, he gave up football for a year, only resuming when his brother, who played for junior club Lochore Welfare invited him to training there. Levein subsequently signed for Lochore and after trials with several senior clubs he finally joined Cowdenbeath in 1981. He quickly established himself in the first team and soon became a target for larger clubs.

===Hearts===

In 1983, he moved to Heart of Midlothian for a fee of £40,000 and soon found himself a regular place in their first team. Levein won the SPFA Young Player of the Year award in 1985 and 1986, becoming the first player to retain the title. In the latter season Hearts chased a league and cup double. Two goals in the last 10 minutes of the season by Albert Kidd gave Hearts their first league defeat in 31 games, which handed the league title to Celtic. Levein missed that game through illness. He returned to the Hearts team the following week in the 1986 Scottish Cup Final, which Hearts lost 3–0 to Aberdeen.

1986 brought further woe for the young Levein when he picked up a serious knee injury in a reserve team game against Hibernian. The injury was to change his life. He had a recurrence of the injury in 1988 when he collapsed unchallenged in a game against Rangers and spent a second year out of the game.

It was not just injuries that kept Levein from playing during his time at Hearts: he was given a 12-game ban after punching, and breaking the nose of, Hearts teammate Graeme Hogg during a pre-season friendly against Raith Rovers.

Levein was forced to retire from playing in 1997, due to another serious knee injury. He made 401 appearances for Hearts.

===Scotland===

He made his Scotland debut in March 1990, a 1–0 win against reigning world champions, Argentina, at Hampden Park and played well enough to earn a place in Scotland&#x27;s 1990 World Cup squad. Levein won 16 caps for the Scotland national team.

==Coaching and managerial career==
After being forced into retirement as a player, Levein had coaching positions at Hearts and at Livingston. In November 1997 he was appointed as manager of Cowdenbeath and turned a struggling team into one that could challenge for promotion. Cowdenbeath were promoted in 2001, but Levein had left in December 2000 to take over as manager at Hearts.

=== Hearts manager ===

His time in charge of Hearts was successful, where he guided them to third place in the SPL in two successive seasons and thus into European competition. He was the first manager to take Hearts into Europe in successive seasons since the 1960s.

=== Leicester City ===
His impressive record in Scotland caught the attention of Leicester City, who appointed Levein as manager on 29 October 2004. However, after a poor start to the 2005–06 season, which left the club third from bottom in the Championship relegation zone, he was sacked as manager on 25 January 2006.

===Raith Rovers===
Levein was appointed as manager of his boyhood heroes, Scottish Second Division club Raith Rovers, on 5 September 2006, on a non-contract basis. However, after Dundee United parted company with Craig Brewster, Levein left his non-contract role at Raith Rovers to take up the job at Tannadice.

===Dundee United===
He was unveiled to the press on 30 October 2006. Levein guided United to four successive home victories, earning him &#x27;Manager of the Month&#x27; for November 2006, later repeating the award in March 2007 and again in October 2007. On 21 January 2008 he was appointed Director of Football at the club, giving him a seat on the Board of Directors in addition to his existing managerial responsibilities. In August 2008, he was fined £5000 by the SFA for accusing a referee (Mike McCurry) of bias after a game against Rangers.

During his tenure, United regularly finished in the top half of the Scottish Premier League. The club reached the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final, which United led twice before losing to Rangers on a penalty shootout. Levein signed a new contract with United in December 2008, but he left the job in December 2009 to become Scotland national football team manager. United went on to win the 2009–10 Scottish Cup under his successor Peter Houston, who had been Levein&#x27;s assistant. Levein overhauled the club&#x27;s youth system, which subsequently brought through players such as Ryan Gauld and John Souttar.

===Scotland manager===
On 23 December 2009, Levein left Dundee United to become the new Scotland manager. He agreed to a -year deal. Scotland won 1–0 in his first match in charge, a friendly against the Czech Republic, with the goal coming from Celtic captain Scott Brown. However, his second game in charge would not be as successful, with Scotland going down 3–0 to Sweden on 12 August 2010. This was also followed by a disappointing 0–0 draw with Lithuania and an unconvincing 2–1 victory over Liechtenstein in the first two Euro 2012 qualifying matches.

Levein dropped in-form striker Kenny Miller and played an ultra-defensive 4–6–0 against Czech Republic in their third game. The match ended in a 1–0 defeat, with Levein attracting criticism for his negative tactics. Levein later said that he had adopted the formation after seeing Russian club Rubin Kazan achieve a good result against FC Barcelona with that approach. He also conceded that he perhaps should not have done this without knowing the players well, early in his tenure as manager.

In the following game, against World and European champions Spain, Levein adopted a more conventional 4–5–1 formation with Miller in attack. Scotland lost 2–3 despite coming back from 0–2 down to draw level at 2–2. Scotland then beat Faroe Islands 3–0 in a friendly where Levein gave seven debuts due to 9 withdrawals from the initial squad. Scotland won the first two matches of the 2011 Nations Cup with ease, beating Northern Ireland 3–0 and Wales 3–1. The Scots lost 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland in their third game, meaning that the Republic won the tournament.

In order to reach the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs, Scotland realistically needed to beat the Czech Republic in their next qualifier. The match ended in a 2–2 draw, after two late controversial penalty kick decisions by Dutch referee Kevin Blom both went against Scotland. 1–0 wins in the next two qualifiers against Lithuania and Liechtenstein kept their chances mathematically alive, but a 3–1 defeat by Spain coupled with the Czech Republic winning in Lithuania eliminated Scotland.

For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Scotland were drawn into UEFA qualifying Group A with Belgium, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Wales. Preparations started with a 1–1 draw in Slovenia, but the team suffered a 5–1 defeat by the United States in May. Scotland bounced back with a 3–1 friendly win against Australia in August. Levein attracted criticism for selecting Ian Black for that match, despite him playing in the fourth-tier Scottish Third Division. Levein had previously said that it would be &quot;very difficult&quot; for any player to go from playing in the Third Division to an international match, and had left out Lee Wallace for that reason. Black received a mixed reception when he appeared as a late substitute, with some sections of the crowd booing him.

Levein stated his belief that Scotland were capable of winning all of their qualifying games, but the first two matches ended in home draws against Serbia and Macedonia. Levein was again criticised for adopting negative tactics. Levein then recalled Steven Fletcher and Kris Commons, but Scotland fell to two away defeats against Wales and Belgium, which left the Scots bottom of Group A with only 2 points from 4 games. He was relieved of his duties on 5 November 2012, following talks with the Scottish Football Association.

===Return to Hearts===
Levein returned to Hearts in May 2014, as he was appointed director of football by new owner Ann Budge. In that role, Levein oversaw the appointments of Robbie Neilson and Ian Cathro as head coach of Hearts. Four weeks after Cathro was sacked in August 2017, Levein was appointed first team manager. He signed a three-year contract as manager, while also continuing as director of football.

Levein was sacked as Hearts manager and director of football on 31 October 2019, although he was retained in an advisory role until May 2020.

===Brechin City===
During the 2020–21 season Levein worked for BBC Scotland as a pundit. He joined Brechin City as an advisor to their board of directors in June 2021, shortly after their relegation to the Highland League.

===St Johnstone===
Levein returned to management in November 2023 with St Johnstone. However, he was sacked in September 2024, following a set of 4 consecutive losses in the SPFL.

<text>The Hong Kong Government Flying Service (HKGFS) is a disciplined unit and paramilitary flying organisation of the Government of Hong Kong.

The service has its head office in, and operates from, the southwestern end of Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok. Before the opening of the Chek Lap Kok airport in 1998, it operated from the old Kai Tak Airport, the former Hong Kong International Airport. GFS patrols as far as to the south, to include the Hong Kong Flight Information Region and the Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre area of responsibility, which covers most of the South China Sea basin.

== History ==
The Government Flying Service was established on 1 April 1993, when Hong Kong was under British rule. It then took over all the non-military operations of the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force (RHKAAF), which was an auxiliary unit of the United Kingdom Royal Air Force. After Hong Kong was handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997, the GFS remained as a government unit of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and is responsible for search and rescue (SAR), air ambulance, firefighting, and police operations.

Starting in 2012, the GFS operates from the HKCEC heliport, adjacent to Golden Bauhinia Square. The site is also open to commercial traffic.

In August 2020, a GFS Bombardier Challenger 605 maritime patrol aircraft was believed to have assisted Chinese authorities in intercepting 12 Hong Kongers who were attempting to flee to Taiwan due to increasingly onerous conditions in Hong Kong and enhanced exit controls. The Hong Kong government denied that they had cooperated with Chinese authorities. On December 21, 2020, the United States Bureau of Industry and Security amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding a new ‘Military End User&#x27; (MEU) List, as well as the first tranche of 103 entities, which includes 58 Chinese and 45 Russian companies. Government Flying Service was added as one of 103 entities to the MEU List.

In 2022, a new site at the southernmost corner of the former Kai Tak airport was opened, featuring one landing/takeoff pad, two parking pads, one repair hangar for the new Airbus H175 helicopter and an operations/office building. The site had been earmarked since 2007 and planning permission was given in 2017 as part of the area&#x27;s redevelopment, as well as limitations of new high rise buildings in the Tung Chung area near the existing base affecting marginal weather operations. The possibility of opening the base to commercial cross-boundary traffic has been raised since 2011.

== Operations ==
GFS consists of five divisions:

* Operations Division – all emergency response and operational matters (i.e. search and rescue)
* Training and Standards Division – professional standards and development
* Corporate Safety Division - safety-related initiatives and cross-section safety management matters 
* Engineering Division – maintenance of GFS aircraft and ground-support equipment in accordance with the Civil Aviation Department standards
* Administration Division – general administration, personnel support services

Helicopters can land on five highways in Hong Kong to attend to road related recovery operations. For long-range search and rescue operations, the GFS initially use fixed wing aircraft which then guide helicopters to the location.

*Air ambulance service response time (type A+/A) – 20 minutes (within island zone) / 30 minutes (outside island zone)
*Search and rescue callout time 0700-2159 -(within 50 nm/92.5 km of GFS HQ) – 1hr / 1hr 40m (with additional/specialized equipment)
*Search and rescue callout time 2200-0659 -(within 50 nm/92.5 km of GFS HQ) – 2hr
*For SARs outside 50 nm / 92.5 km – add 30mins per 50 nm
*Fixed Winged Aircraft 0700-2159 – (within 50 nm/92.5 km of GFS)- 50m, (between 50 nm/92.5 km to 100 nm/185 km of GFS)- 1hr 5m, (beyond 100 nm/185 km of GFS)- add 15m per 50 nm.
The GFS operates primarily from Chek Lap Kok airport, where headquarters and all fixed wing aviation is based. Some helicopters are based in the Kai Tak division and a helipad is available in Wan Chai next to the HKCEC.

== Rank ==
Prior to the creation of the GFS, the ranks within the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force were the same as the RAF. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the transition to local staff in the RHKAAF in preparation for the civil transfer to the GFS role.

Ranking of personnel of the GFS are civilian aviation roles and are as follows:

Pilot II and Cadet Pilot ranks were created in the 1990s for local pilots with less flying experience.

== Controllers ==
List of past controllers of the GFS:

* Captain Brian Cluer - former RAF fighter pilot and General Manager of Operations, Cathay Pacific
* Captain Brian Butt Yiu-ming - formerly with Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force and Chief Inspector with Hong Kong Police specializing in the counterfeit detection

== Crest ==
The current crest of the force was adopted in 1997, prior to which the Hong Kong Coat of Arms was used on GFS aircraft. The current is topped with the Hong Kong Bauhinia flower. In the centre of the crest is a navy blue (sometimes purple) and light blue roundel background. In the middle of the crest is a four bladed propeller, and a Chinese dragon in the front (similar to the RHKAAF crest). Along the bottom of the roundel are the letters GFS representing the english name of the service. Underneath the roundel are a pair of wings joined by a ribbon with the Chinese characters &quot;政府飛行服務隊&quot;, the Chinese name of the service.

== GFS in the media ==
* The service&#x27;s official theme song, &quot;Wishing You Well So Much&quot; (多想你好), was sung by Andy Lau in 2003.
* The TVB drama &quot;Always Ready&quot; was filmed inside GFS HQ in 2005 and starred Ekin Cheng.

== Incidents ==
* 26 August 2003 – A Eurocopter EC 155 B1 crashed on a hill at Pak Kung Au near Tung Chung on Lantau Island killing two aircrew (Pilot Pang Fu-kwok and Airman Chan Man-tik).
* 27 December 2010 – One of the GFS&#x27;s Eurocopter Super Puma Mk II helicopters (B-HRN) ditched in Shing Mun Reservoir after the loss of its number 2 engine. It was in the process of collecting water from the reservoir to drop on a hill fire. None of the three crew members were injured. The Civil Aviation Department said on the following day it had retrieved the flight data recorder. Pending a final report, an interim bulletin issued in February 2012 reported that the number 2 engine was correctly shut down automatically by the engine control unit because the turbine had begun to overspeed, because there appeared to be no fault in the turbine or the fuel systems the overspeed was possibly the result of a disconnection of the engine from the main gearbox because of wear to the freewheel unit that connected the two. The Helicopter was rebuilt by the engineering team after it was recovered from the reservoir.

==Other campuses==
Concord University&#x27;s main campus is located in Athens, West Virginia. The university also operates in a center near Beckley. The facility was established to coordinate the public colleges serving the region with five founding institutions. US Senator Robert C. Byrd secured $10 million from the US Department of Health and Human Services to develop the campus and begin building the facility. It is named the Erma Byrd Higher Education Center (after the deceased spouse of Senator Byrd) in Beaver. The center was designed to also serve as a catalyst to attract business and industry to the area. Concord University&#x27;s Beckley office coordinates classes at the Erma Byrd Center as well as at several other facilities in and surrounding Beckley.

==Campus organizations==
Concord sponsors nearly 200 on-campus organizations, including fraternities, sororities, religious and political organizations, an Art Society, chapters of Delta Zeta, Alpha Sigma Alpha, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Phi Alpha Delta, Alpha Phi Omega, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Phi, Sigma Tau Delta, Alpha Sigma Tau, Gay-Straight Alliance, College Republicans, Young Democrats, a chapter of Amtgard known as the &quot;Shire of Nowhere Mountains,&quot; and a community theatre organization known as the Appalachian Shakespeare Project.

The Concord University Student Government Association (SGA) is responsible for many changes on campus and is active in every aspect of Concord life. All organizations are required to send a representative to all SGA meetings if they would like to ability to vote in the Student Senate and obtain budgetary privileges to request funds from the Student Government&#x27;s Discretionary fund. The Student Government at Concord University is especially advanced compared to other SGAs in West Virginia, and is noted for its model judicial system wherein a student court, composed entirely of students, handles the majority of adjudications for most student offenses. The Student Government is also one of few student governments in the state of West Virginia that have a voting member on the university&#x27;s Board of Governors.

==Residence life==

There are five residence halls on campus. North (female) and South (male) Towers house the fraternities and sororities as well as Honors and several sports teams. Each floor has two lounges. There is one co-ed hall, Sarvay, which is also the oldest building on campus still standing. Sarvay is traditionally a female dorm, but, due to a shortage of housing, men lived on the first floor. The other two halls are Wilson for women and Woodell, nicknamed &quot;The Woo,&quot; for men. Housing is not divided by year. Several floors are set aside as &quot;substance free,&quot; and the rest allow alcohol if both residents are over 21.

The North and South Towers complex underwent a major renovation, which was completed in 2017.

As of the fall semester of 2018, the only residence halls open were North Tower, South Tower, and Wilson Hall, due to lack of enrollment.

Wilson Hall now acts as a co-ed hall, with men and women living on separate floors.

==Athletics==
Concord University, known athletically as the &quot;Mountain Lions&quot;, is home to many intercollegiate and intramural athletics teams. The men&#x27;s intercollegiate teams include: baseball, basketball, football, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis, and track and field. The women&#x27;s intercollegiate teams include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, and track and field. Concord University is an NCAA Division II school, and a member of the Mountain East Conference. The Office of Student Affairs provides intramurals in many athletic activities, including flag football, volleyball, and basketball.

<text>Leona Dombrowsky (born April 29, 1957) is a former Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2011 who represented the ridings of Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington and Prince Edward—Hastings. She served as a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Dombrowsky was born in Belleville, Ontario and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1979. She was elected as a Catholic School trustee on the Hastings-Prince Edward Separate School Board in 1985, and served as its Chair from 1991 to 1996. In 1998, she was elected to the amalgamated Algonquin-Lakeshore Catholic District School Board. She was also a Director of the Ontario Catholic Trustees Association during this period, and served on the Tweed Parks &amp; Recreation Committee from 1991 to 1997. As of 2012, she served as a justice of the peace.

==Politics==
Dombrowsky was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, as a Liberal in the rural riding of Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington (which surrounds the city of Kingston, Ontario) defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Harry Danford by about 2,000 votes. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives; despite her lack of experience, Dombrowsky soon emerged as a prominent voice in the opposition benches, serving as Official Opposition Critic for Community, Family and Children&#x27;s Services and Deputy House Leader.

The Liberals won the provincial election of 2003, and Dombrowsky was re-elected by about 8,000 votes over her Progressive Conservative opponent. On October 23, 2003, she was appointed Minister of the Environment. In this capacity, she was responsible for overseeing changes to the province&#x27;s water supply system (the safety of which was called into question after a tragic outbreak of e-coli in Walkerton, Ontario). Dombrowsky&#x27;s ministry hired more full-time water inspectors and also called for the phasing out of coal-fired electrical generating plants.

On June 29, 2005 Dombrowsky became Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. On January 18, 2010, Dombrowsky was named Minister of Education.

In the 2011 election, she lost her seat to Progressive Conservative Todd Smith.

<doc id="1083721" wikidata="Q253728" url="?curid=1083721" title="Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix">
<text>In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix, CKM matrix, quark mixing matrix, or KM matrix is a unitary matrix that contains information on the strength of the flavour-changing weak interaction. Technically, it specifies the mismatch of quantum states of quarks when they propagate freely and when they take part in the weak interactions. It is important in the understanding of CP violation. This matrix was introduced for three generations of quarks by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, adding one generation to the matrix previously introduced by Nicola Cabibbo. This matrix is also an extension of the GIM mechanism, which only includes two of the three current families of quarks.

==The matrix==
===Predecessor – the Cabibbo matrix===

In 1963, Nicola Cabibbo introduced the Cabibbo angle () to preserve the universality of the weak interaction. 
Cabibbo was inspired by previous work by Murray Gell-Mann and Maurice Lévy,
on the effectively rotated nonstrange and strange vector and axial weak currents, which he references.

In light of current concepts (quarks had not yet been proposed), the Cabibbo angle is related to the relative probability that down and strange quarks decay into up quarks ( ||   and   || , respectively). In particle physics terminology, the object that couples to the up quark via charged-current weak interaction is a superposition of down-type quarks, here denoted by .
Mathematically this is:

:formula_1

or using the Cabibbo angle:

:formula_2

Using the currently accepted values for   ||   and   ||   (see below), the Cabibbo angle can be calculated using

:formula_3

When the charm quark was discovered in 1974, it was noticed that the down and strange quark could transition into either the up or charm quark, leading to two sets of equations:

:formula_4
:formula_5

or using the Cabibbo angle:

:formula_6
:formula_7

This can also be written in matrix notation as:

:formula_8

or using the Cabibbo angle

:formula_9

where the various || represent the probability that the quark of flavor decays into a quark of flavor . This 2×2 rotation matrix is called the &quot;Cabibbo matrix&quot;, and was subsequently expanded to the 3×3 CKM matrix.

===CKM matrix===

In 1973, observing that CP-violation could not be explained in a four-quark model, Kobayashi and Maskawa generalized the Cabibbo matrix into the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix (or CKM matrix) to keep track of the weak decays of three generations of quarks:

:formula_10

On the left are the weak interaction doublet partners of down-type quarks, and on the right is the CKM matrix, along with a vector of mass eigenstates of down-type quarks. The CKM matrix describes the probability of a transition from one flavour quark to another flavour quark. These transitions are proportional to ||.

As of 2023, the best determination of the individual magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements was:
:formula_11

Using those values, one can check the unitarity of the CKM matrix. In particular, we find that the first-row matrix elements give: formula_12 

making the experimental results in line with the theoretical value of 1.

The choice of usage of down-type quarks in the definition is a convention, and does not represent a physically preferred asymmetry between up-type and down-type quarks. Other conventions are equally valid: The mass eigenstates , , and of the up-type quarks can equivalently define the matrix in terms of &quot;their&quot; weak interaction partners , , and . Since the CKM matrix is unitary, its inverse is the same as its conjugate transpose, which the alternate choices use; it appears as the same matrix, in a slightly altered form.

==General case construction==
To generalize the matrix, count the number of physically important parameters in this matrix which appear in experiments. If there are generations of quarks (2 flavours) then

* An  ×  unitary matrix (that is, a matrix such that , where is the conjugate transpose of and is the identity matrix) requires 2 real parameters to be specified.
* 2 − 1 of these parameters are not physically significant, because one phase can be absorbed into each quark field (both of the mass eigenstates, and of the weak eigenstates), but the matrix is independent of a common phase. Hence, the total number of free variables independent of the choice of the phases of basis vectors is 2 − (2 − 1) = ( − 1)2.
** Of these, ( − 1) are rotation angles called &quot;quark mixing angles&quot;.
** The remaining ( − 1)( − 2) are complex phases, which cause CP violation.

=== = 2 ===
For the case  = 2, there is only one parameter, which is a mixing angle between two generations of quarks. Historically, this was the first version of CKM matrix when only two generations were known. It is called the Cabibbo angle after its inventor Nicola Cabibbo.

=== = 3 ===
For the Standard Model case ( = 3), there are three mixing angles and one CP-violating complex phase.

==Observations and predictions==
Cabibbo&#x27;s idea originated from a need to explain two observed phenomena:
#the transitions and had similar amplitudes.
#the transitions with change in strangeness had amplitudes equal to of those with 
Cabibbo&#x27;s solution consisted of postulating &quot;weak universality&quot; (see below) to resolve the first issue, along with a mixing angle , now called the &quot;Cabibbo angle&quot;, between the and quarks to resolve the second.

For two generations of quarks, there can be no CP violating phases, as shown by the counting of the previous section. Since CP violations &quot;had&quot; already been seen in 1964, in neutral kaon decays, the Standard Model that emerged soon after clearly indicated the existence of a third generation of quarks, as Kobayashi and Maskawa pointed out in 1973. The discovery of the bottom quark at Fermilab (by Leon Lederman&#x27;s group) in 1976 therefore immediately started off the search for the top quark, the missing third-generation quark.

Note, however, that the specific values that the angles take on are &quot;not&quot; a prediction of the standard model: They are free parameters. At present, there is no generally-accepted theory that explains why the angles should have the values that are measured in experiments.

==Weak universality==
The constraints of unitarity of the CKM-matrix on the diagonal terms can be written as

::formula_13

separately for each generation . This implies that the sum of all couplings of any &quot;one&quot; of the up-type quarks to &quot;all&quot; the down-type quarks is the same for all generations. This relation is called &quot;weak universality&quot; and was first pointed out by Nicola Cabibbo in 1967. Theoretically it is a consequence of the fact that all SU(2) doublets couple with the same strength to the vector bosons of weak interactions. It has been subjected to continuing experimental tests.

==The unitarity triangles==
The remaining constraints of unitarity of the CKM-matrix can be written in the form

:formula_14

For any fixed and different and , this is a constraint on three complex numbers, one for each , which says that these numbers form the sides of a triangle in the complex plane. There are six choices of and (three independent), and hence six such triangles, each of which is called a &quot;unitary triangle&quot;. Their shapes can be very different, but they all have the same area, which can be related to the CP violating phase. The area vanishes for the specific parameters in the Standard Model for which there would be no CP violation. The orientation of the triangles depend on the phases of the quark fields.

A popular quantity amounting to twice the area of the unitarity triangle is the Jarlskog invariant (introduced by Cecilia Jarlskog in 1985), 
:formula_15 
For Greek indices denoting up quarks and Latin ones down quarks, the 4-tensor formula_16 is doubly antisymmetric,
:formula_17
Up to antisymmetry, it only has non-vanishing components, which, remarkably, from the unitarity of , can be shown to be &quot;all identical in magnitude&quot;, that is,
:formula_18
so that 
:formula_19

Since the three sides of the triangles are open to direct experiment, as are the three angles, a class of tests of the Standard Model is to check that the triangle closes. This is the purpose of a modern series of experiments under way at the Japanese BELLE and the American BaBar experiments, as well as at LHCb in CERN, Switzerland.

==Parameterizations==
Four independent parameters are required to fully define the CKM matrix. Many parameterizations have been proposed, and three of the most common ones are shown below.

===KM parameters===
The original parameterization of Kobayashi and Maskawa used three angles (, , ) and a CP-violating phase angle (). is the Cabibbo angle. For brevity, the cosines and sines of the angles are denoted and , for respectively. 
::formula_20

===&quot;Standard&quot; parameters===
A &quot;standard&quot; parameterization of the CKM matrix uses three Euler angles (, , ) and one CP-violating phase (). is the Cabibbo angle. This is the convention advocated by the Particle Data Group. Couplings between quark generations and vanish if . Cosines and sines of the angles are denoted and , respectively.
::formula_21

The 2008 values for the standard parameters were:

A third parameterization of the CKM matrix was introduced by Lincoln Wolfenstein with the four real parameters , , , and , which would all &#x27;vanish&#x27; (would be zero) if there were no coupling. The four Wolfenstein parameters have the property that all are of order 1 and are related to the &#x27;standard&#x27; parameterization:

Although the Wolfenstein parameterization of the CKM matrix can be as exact as desired when carried to high order, it is mainly used for generating convenient approximations to the standard parameterization. The approximation to order , good to better than 0.3% accuracy, is:
::formula_22

Rates of CP violation correspond to the parameters and .

Using the values of the previous section for the CKM matrix, as of 2008 the best determination of the Wolfenstein parameter values is:
: =.22500 ± 0.0067,   = ,   = 0.159±0.010,   and   = 0.348±0.010.

==Nobel Prize==
In 2008, Kobayashi and Maskawa shared one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature&quot;. Some physicists were reported to harbor bitter feelings about the fact that the Nobel Prize committee failed to reward the work of Cabibbo, whose prior work was closely related to that of Kobayashi and Maskawa. Asked for a reaction on the prize, Cabibbo preferred to give no comment.

<text>Hailsham is a town, a civil parish and the administrative centre of the Wealden district of East Sussex, England. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it is called &quot;Hamelesham&quot;. in one part, yet mentioned in another part of the same book as ‘’’Tilux’’’, the land of Ricard de Tunbrige. The town of Hailsham has a history of industry and agriculture.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hailsham&quot; is thought to come from the Saxon &quot;Haegels Ham&quot;, meaning the clearing or settlement of Haegel, Hella or a similar name, possibly even &quot;Aella&#x27;s Ham&quot;, the clearing of Aella the Saxon. The name of the town has been spelt in various ways through the ages from ‘Hamelsham’ (as it was referred to in the Domesday Book), &quot;Aylesham&quot; in the 13th century, and later Haylesham, to its present spelling.

==History==

The site of Hailsham has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic age. It was an Ancient British settlement that existed before the Romans invaded Kent and Sussex in 43 AD. The Anglo Saxons invaded Sussex in the year 477 AD. The Saxons are thought to have invaded at an original landing place at Selsey. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in 491 AD they attacked and took the British stronghold of Anderida which was the fort that is believed to have been built by the Ancient British and the Romans at what is now Pevensey, just a few miles from Hailsham, thereby consolidating their conquest and forming the small kingdom of the South Saxons, or Sussex.

In Roman and Saxon times, the lowland marsh area between Anderida and the site of Hailsham, today known as the Pevensey Levels, is presumed to be unreclaimed at that time, so that much of the levels would have been a saltmarsh and at high tide, a lagoon. The link between Hailsham and the levels is preserved in the name of the access routes such as Marshfoot Lane and Saltmarsh Lane.

The manor of Hailsham is recorded in the Domesday Survey completed by the Normans in 1086, 20 years after the conquest, when there were just four households, as well as ploughing land and salt houses. There was some activity in this part of Sussex during the baronial wars and in the armed rivalry between Matilda and Stephen.

During the 17th century civil war between Charles I and Parliament, Hailsham and this part of Sussex declared against the royalist cause.

Little is known of the town of Hailsham before the 1086 Domesday Book, but evidence of a Roman road from Leap Cross across the Common indicates some occupation prior to this.

===Market town status===
Henry III granted the town a Market Charter in 1252. Originally, the market was held in the High Street and in Market Square, only moving to its present location in 1868. Sheep and cattle were driven from miles around along the various ancient droves until the arrival of the railway station and motor lorries. Today, the weekly livestock markets, together with the monthly farmers’ market continue whilst stall markets are held weekly in the town centre on Saturdays or Thursdays.

===Hailsham Museum &amp; Heritage Centre===
Glimpses of the town&#x27;s past are to be found in photographs and artefacts available for viewing at the Heritage Centre in Blackman&#x27;s Yard, Market Street, which is run by members of the Hailsham Historical and Natural History Society. A small display is available to members of the public including period kitchen, farming and agriculture, local industry and wartime memorabilia.

==The Parish of Hailsham==
The civic parish of Hailsham is approximately in breadth and from north to south between its extreme points. Its boundary (going in a clockwise direction) runs from its most northerly limit, near Carter&#x27;s Corner Place, in a southerly direction around Magham Down, over the Herstmonceux road and crosses the low-lying farmlands, passing close to New Bridge and on across Horse Eye Level to Rickney.

It then turns westwards taking an irregular course over the Glynleigh Level, across the Cuckoo Trail (former railway line) to the main Eastbourne road (A22), continuing northwards along this for about three-quarters of a mile until it goes west and north again to take in some of the woodlands around Cacklebury.

It runs on the west side of the A22 in a northerly direction between Hailsham and the River Cuckmere to Hempstead, where it turns east to meet the A22. It then runs northwards to the point where the Cuckmere crosses the A22 and follows the river eastwards to Horsebridge and the A271.

On an irregular course eastwards, sometimes following the A271 and sometimes to the north of it, until Amberstone where it completes its delineation by a final straight mile along the line of the road to Carter&#x27;s Corner Place.

This includes the areas, which under the Wealden Parishes Order 1991, were transferred to Hailsham being a large area of Hellingly Parish (the residential areas around Anglesey Avenue, Upper Horsebridge and Lansdowne Drive) along with several smaller areas to the east, south and west (transferred from Arlington, Hellingly and Pevensey Parishes). A further area of Hellingly Parish (between the A22 and Anglesey Avenue) was transferred to Hailsham under the Wealden Parishes Order 1993.

==Geography and climate==
In the county of East Sussex, about from the coast, and between the well-wooded hills of the southern Forest Ridge and the undulating chalk countryside of the South Downs, Hailsham is surrounded by &quot;much attractive and unspoilt scenery&quot;. Hailsham is the largest settlement in the southern half of the Wealden district, and the largest inland town in East Sussex with around 8,500 homes and a population of just over 20,000.

===Location and accessibility===
Hailsham is north of Eastbourne; south of Tunbridge Wells; west of Hastings; and east of the County town of Lewes. London is some away.

* Average House Price: For the year 2012, £200,463

===Crime===
Hailsham falls below the national average for reported robbery, burglaries and other criminal offences.

Local/regional crime figures
(statistics are per 1,000 of the population within the local authority (Wealden) area (2008/09)
On Saturday 18 August 2018, a unit on Diplocks Way Industrial Estate was raided by the National Crime Agency where a large number of handguns and ammunition were discovered. Three men have appeared in court and all been charged with firearms offences. More than 30 handguns and a ‘significant’ amount of ammunition was seized in what the NCA describe as a &#x27;sophisticated gun factory&#x27;.

==Governance and administration==
In Hailsham, there are three tiers of local government which manage between them the majority of local community services and amenities.

===Town===
At the local level, Hailsham is represented by Hailsham Town Council. The councillors are elected from seven wards: Hailsham Central Ward (3 seats); Hailsham East Ward (3 seats); Hailsham South Ward (2 seats); Hailsham North Ward (3 seats); Hailsham West Ward (3 seats); Hailsham North West Ward (3 seats) and Magham Down Ward (1 seat).

Paul Holbrook was elected as Town Mayor &amp; Chair in May 2023 and Anne Marie Ricketts is the current Deputy Town Mayor &amp; Vice-Chair. Both remain in post until May 2024.

===District===
Hailsham is the home of Wealden District Council. District Council Elections are held every four years. Fifty five Councillors in total are elected, six of these from the three wards that make up Hailsham. The May 2011 election returned 47 Conservative, 3 Liberal Democrat, 4 Independent Democrat and 1 No party allegiance/non-group.

===County===
The next level of government is the East Sussex County Council with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. For these elections Hailsham is combined with Herstmonceux to return two seats.

===Parliament===
Hailsham is in the Sussex Weald parliamentary constituency. Prior to Brexit in 2020, Hailsham was part of the South East England constituency in the European Parliament. The current MP for the area is Conservative Nus Ghani, one of the Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons. Former MP&#x27;s include former Minister of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Charles Hendry (2001-2015) and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith (1965-2001.)

==Economy==
Many years ago it became the market town for the prosperous surrounding agricultural district. There are local light industrial undertakings.

===Industry and commerce===

Hailsham was granted a charter to hold a market in 1252 by King Henry III.
From 1997 to 2012, there was much controversy over the sale of Hailsham Cattle Market and its redevelopment into a supermarket. The land freehold was, until being sold to market operator South East Marts in January 2012, owned by supermarket chain Aldi who planned to build a supermarket on the site, although the amended planning application was rejected by Wealden District Council in November 2007. Should the market have closed as a result of development, the nearest alternatives would have been in Ashford, Kent or Salisbury, Wiltshire. Local MP Charles Hendry, the National Farmers Union among others spoke out against closure. and the Public Inquiry lodged by Aldi against the District Council&#x27;s decision to refuse planning permission commenced on 11 February 2009 and ended on 19 February 2009.

Hailsham&#x27;s traditional industry was rope making, which included supplying ropes for public hanging to Great Britain and the Colonies. Currently, light industry survives in two large industrial estates to the west of the town, located in Diplocks Way and Station Road, and several smaller ones including those situated in Hackhurst Lane (Lower Dicker) and north of Old Swan Lane, all of which provide a source of employment for local residents.

===Shopping and retail===

Hailsham has a variety of local and national shops, restaurants and several supermarkets. The main shopping area has developed along the High Street and George Street. A parade of units at St Mary&#x27;s Walk made a contribution to retail facilities in Hailsham.

The Quintins development, near the Vicarage Field precinct, was opened in the late 1980s, creating a focus for shopping in Hailsham. The shopping centre was named after Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone. At the heart of the centre was the Co-operative (supermarket) until its closure on 15 July 2011 following which it was replaced by an ASDA supermarket. There is a Waitrose supermarket nearby in Vicarage Field and in North Street there is a Tesco supermarket which opened on 3 November 2008. Plans to redevelop the Quintins Centre car park to include provision a new large food store, additional units to the North Street frontage and a new car park deck were submitted for public consultation but this development has not taken place.

===Hailsham Forward===
Following a government-commissioned report compiled by Mary Portas, Hailsham Town Council and the local Chamber of Commerce took the decision in September 2012 to form a Town Team (Hailsham Forward), which was set up to take a closer look at ways to revitalise the town&#x27;s High Street and surrounding urban environment, increase footfall and spend within the town.

Hailsham Forward&#x27;s key actions for the next five years include a pedestrian-friendly High Street, parking time restrictions, the creation of loading bays in the town centre, traffic wardens, a review of business rates and shop rents, improvements to shop frontages and signage, and the attraction and retention of a broader diversity of retail outlets (independent national/chain) to fill empty retail units in the town centre.

===Hailsham Street Market===
One of the Hailsham Town Team&#x27;s main initiatives since it was established in 2013 was the establishment of a regular town centre market. The market, which is based in Vicarage Field, is open between 8.30am and 1.30pm every Saturday.

===Hailsham Farmers&#x27; Market===
Established in 1998, Hailsham Farmers&#x27; Market operates on the second Saturday of each month in the Cattle Market, Market Street, from 9.00am to 12.30pm.

=== Chamber of Commerce ===
Hailsham &amp; District Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1984 and exists to support and encourage growth and prosperity within the business community of Hailsham and its environs. The Chamber meets every first Thursday of the month.

==Housing and development==
Extensive development has taken place in Hailsham since 1945 by private developers, with the northern part of the town now largely developed right up to the boundary with Hellingly. Wealden planning policies may result in further development in and around Hailsham, together with increased local infrastructure and services.

The Hailsham &amp; Hellingly Masterplan, submitted to Wealden District Council as supplementary planning guidance in 2009, planned a holistic approach to the town&#x27;s infrastructure: roads; sewerage and drainage; transport; retail; employment land; housing; healthcare; education and training; leisure, recreation and the arts. Among the Masterplan&#x27;s proposals were long-term visualisations for the town&#x27;s roads, including two major (new) relief roads which would make the High Street and town centre more pedestrian-friendly, a community-based diagnostic and treatment centre with GP surgeries, and a community park/complex.

Hailsham town councillors have agreed to support plans for improved infrastructure, including roads, schools and healthcare provision, in light of proposed future new housing developments and will work with Wealden District council to develop an “Area Action Plan” to ensure the required infrastructure in advance of any development.

The Hailsham Neighbourhood (Development) Plan, written and recently submitted by a group made up of members from the community and from Hailsham Town Council, proposes a number of policies relating to what infrastructure and development is needed to sustain future housing growth in Hailsham, taking into consideration local environment and sustainability, design, housing type, traffic and transport, economy, services and facilities.

==Education==

===Primary===

Hailsham has several primary schools, including Hawkes Farm, Grovelands, Phoenix Academy (formerly Marshlands School), Burfield Academy (formerly Hailsham Academy) and White House Academy. Burfield Academy opened in September 2015, under the name of Hailsham Academy, in brand new buildings on its campus on Oaklands Way. Hailsham Community College Primary Academy (part of the Hailsham Community College Academy Trust) opened in September 2019.

===Secondary===
The town has one secondary comprehensive school, Hailsham Community College, located in Battle Road, which achieved a specialist status of sports college.

The town also has an independent secondary school, Bede&#x27;s School, formerly St Bede&#x27;s School.

In literature, the novel &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; uses the fictional Hailsham school as a background, although filming for the screen adaptation was done at Ham House, Surrey.

==Healthcare==
Hailsham is served by five NHS doctors’ practices, one health centre, one physiotherapy unit and four NHS dental practices. Hospitals serving this area are located in Eastbourne, Hastings, Uckfield and Crowborough, and are managed by the East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust.

==Transport==

===Road===

Hailsham is near the junction of two major roads, the A22 road to Eastbourne and the A27 South Coast Trunk Road. 
Hailsham is served by Brighton &amp; Hove route 28 linking with Eastbourne, Lewes and Brighton. Stagecoach Buses on routes that serve the town, extending to Eastbourne, Bexhill and Uckfield). Cuckmere Buses, an independent charity run by volunteers, provides supplementary bus links into Hailsham to and from neighbouring villages. The Hailsham Bus Alliance was set up by Hailsham Town Council in January 2012 to drive forward improvements to the planning of bus routes and bus stop networks.

=== Railways ===
Hailsham used to have a railway station on the Cuckoo Line, running from Polegate to Tunbridge Wells. The line from Polegate was opened in May 1849 and finally closed as part of the Beeching cuts in 1968. The southern of disused line between Polegate and Heathfield is now a cycleway-footpath known as the Cuckoo Trail. Hailsham Railway station outlived the rest of the Cuckoo Line by three years, the section north of Hailsham closing to passenger traffic in 1965. The track was retained with a weekly freight service until April 1968, when a bridge at nearby hamlet Horsebridge was damaged by a road vehicle. With the whole line due for closure, the damaged railway infrastructure was never repaired.

The closure of the section from Polegate to Hailsham was disputed — British Railways going so far as to admit that the town was growing at the time of closure and that the town would soon outgrow other public transport. Despite this, passenger services finished on 9 September 1968 with the final train, composed of two Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) units, leaving Hailsham station to the sound of detonators on the line and the tune of Auld Lang Syne sung by a large crowd who had gathered. After 119 years of railway operation into Hailsham, the line was gone.

Following many years of service, Hailsham Pavilion closed as a cinema in 1965. It served as a bingo hall until 1987, before being purchased by Wealden District Council using a Compulsory Purchase Order, after its owners fell into receivership. By 1999, the Hailsham Old Pavilion Society (H.O.P.S.) had raised enough money to restore the old cinema and signed a 31-year lease at a peppercorn rent.

== The town crest ==
The Hailsham Town Crest was designed by a parish councillor and adopted by Hailsham Town Council for use on all official documents. It was crafted by local resident P. V. Collings in the form of a shield, which was presented to the council, and now hangs in the Town Council offices at The Inglenook in Market Street.

The shield is divided into four sectors. The upper left of these shows the six gold martlets and crown of the armorial bearings of the County of East Sussex. The remaining three quadrants each depict a facet of the town&#x27;s history or culture.

The upper right shows a sheaf of corn, crook and rake, to illustrate the agricultural and rural connections from which Hailsham derived its status as a market town. The lower right shows a mill, possibly the last surviving mill - Hamlin&#x27;s Mill in Mill Road.

Finally, the lower left quadrant depicts a ball of twine and rope &quot;dolly&quot;, representing Hailsham&#x27;s entry into light industry, in the form of ropemaking, which supported factories and &quot;ropewalks&quot; within the town&#x27;s boundaries.

==Sites of interest==
===Buildings and architecture===
Many parts of Hailsham have been lost to redevelopment prior to preservation orders being introduced. The town retains a number of buildings which display evidence of antiquity. The houses are mainly Victorian in character with more modern residential developments around the original town centre.

* War memorial – The High Street war memorial was unveiled on 28 November 1920 by Lord Leconfield, the then Lord Lieutenant of the county. It records the loss to the community of the 86 men killed in World War I and a further 35 lost during the Second World War. The memorial comprises a wheel cross with Celtic lettering under which the names of the dead are listed on two tablets.
* St Mary&#x27;s Church (now called Hailsham Parish Church) – St Mary&#x27;s Church is a grade-listed building and dates back to the early 15th century, although there is evidence of a church on this site in the early 13th century. The building was substantially rebuilt in Victorian times. Five of the peal of eight bells date from 1663 and three from 1889. The present clock was installed to celebrate Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.https://sussexparishchurches.org/church/hailsham-st-mary/
* The Old Vicarage – Now &quot;The Grange&quot;, the Old Vicarage was built 1701-1705 for the Reverend Thomas Hooper as a vicarage for the adjacent church. The architectural style of the house exemplifies what many refer to as the Mary-Anne style which reflect the Dutch domesticity of the William and Mary period, combined with the more grand and formal style of the Queen Anne period, is an early 18th-century residence and a Grade II listed building.
* Fleur de Lys and Inglenook – The &quot;Fleur de Lys&quot; and &quot;Inglenook&quot; in Market Street – one building divided in two in the late 19th century, but now reinstated as one – was originally built in the reign of Elizabeth I (1542) as part of the original hostelry of the town. Later to become the Workhouse, after which it was converted to shops and residential dwellings, it is now the Hailsham Town Council’s offices and meeting room.

* The Grenadier – In 1803, Hailsham Barracks were built to quarter troops intended to man the Martello towers, which defended the Pevensey areas from Napoleon. The barracks were closed after the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.
* The Old Court House - The Old Court House was erected in 1861 consisting of a Court Room together with an office and residence for the Police Superintendent. Prior to 1861, the first Police Station was located at the top of Hailsham High Street. Offenders were placed in the stocks situated in front of the Terminus Hotel, and a gibbet was built on the corner of Summerheath Road and Western Road.
* The Stone – A Grade II listed building, &quot;The Stone&quot; is probably the oldest house in Hailsham and possibly named after an old boundary stone in the grounds, and originally built around 1320 in the style of the Wealden Hall houses. Featuring inglenook fireplaces, a bread oven, a priest hide, and with evidence of early sliding shuttered windows, it was once owned by Cardinal Wolsley.
* Cortlandt – Originally called &quot;Newhouse&quot;, Cortlandt was renamed after one of its previous occupants, Philip van Courtlandt, an American who fought on the British side in the American War of Independence. The renaming was undertaken by William Strickland.

* The Old Court House – Erected in 1861 consisting of a Court Room together with an office and residence for the Police Superintendent, The Old Court House was, prior to 1861, the first Police Station in Hailsham.
* The Old Brewery – Built in 1827 by Thomas Gooch from Norfolk, The Old Brewery was renowned for strong beers. The building was used by a succession of brewers and was, for a while, used as a Catholic place of worship.
* Hamlin&#x27;s Mill – The one mill believed to be the town&#x27;s last surviving one was Hamlin&#x27;s Mill (where the remains of the mill&#x27;s ancillary buildings can still be seen today). The mill was a smock type built in 1834, and was destroyed by fire on 17 November 1923. It was replaced by a powder mill, but by 1969, it was being used as a sack mill when it was again destroyed by fire.
* Harebeating Mill – Harebeating Mill, a post mill located at St Wilfrid&#x27;s Green just off the top of Hailsham High Street, was previously known as Kenward&#x27;s Mill. Only the lower floor of the mill remains and this, together with a more modern upper storey, has been converted into a private house.
* Michelham Priory – Michelham Priory at Upper Dicker in Hailsham, was founded for Augustinian Canons in 1229 in the Sussex Weald. It is surrounded by a great medieval moat, with 7 acres of lawns and gardens. Parts of the Priory buildings were destroyed at the Dissolution in 1636, and the remaining buildings formed the nucleus of a fine Tudor house built in the late 16th century. The property was owned by the Sackville family from 1603 to 1897 and was given to the Sussex Archeological Trust in 1959.

===Parks and gardens===
* Hailsham Country Park covers approximately 22 acres and incorporates woodland, an open field area, wildflower meadow, two ponds and a lake. A water course skirts the open field area and all-weather footpaths can be found throughout the park. The various woodland sites within the Country Park have a very good selection of tree species including birch, oak, ash, maple and wild cherry. Wildlife residing in the area includes voles, mice, lizards and weasels. The Hailsham Country Park received South &amp; South East in Bloom Silver Awards in 2009 and 2010, in recognition of the efforts of volunteers to restore the park&#x27;s wildflower meadow and the planting of additional trees in recent years.

* The Common Pond in Bellbanks Road has been a focal point in Hailsham for centuries and is considered to be the town&#x27;s &quot;Jewel In The Crown&quot;. The commons were largely enclosed in 1855, but the pond area was retained by the lord of the manor, Lord Sackville. It was finally bought by the Council in 1922 for £300, and became a public open space. Radical works to the 1.86 acre site began in 1996. The pond base was then excavated and surplus clay used to extend the existing central island, before the construction of a second island and a sloping marginal wetland area along and over a section of the south perimeter wall. Many thousands of carp and other fishes were removed, and not replaced.
* The Dennis King Memorial Orchard &amp; Sensory Garden was officially opened in 2010 to help reverse the trend in the loss of traditional English orchards and create a fully accessible community garden for local residents. Advice and recommendations were received from the East Sussex Association of Blind and Partially Sighted People (ESAB) and Thrive, a national charity dedicated to enabling positive change in the lives of disabled and disadvantaged people through the use of gardening and horticulture.

===Other sites of interest===

* Burfield Park – In 1807, Thomas Burfield, a local saddle maker, founded his rope company in Hailsham. Ropes were produced for the demands of the re-emerging yachting industry, which was just recovering after World War II. Furthermore, all the official hangman&#x27;s ropes used here and in the colonies were made in Hailsham. Today, Marlow Ropes has a new purpose-built factory and warehouse, and continues to manufacture ropes on the same site.
* Market Square – the site of the original market, with sellers spreading out into the adjoining roads. A market cross was erected in the square to make sure all deals were seen to be &quot;done in the sight of the Lord&quot;. The cross was removed around 1880, to allow carts to turn the corners of the roads leading to the square.
* Amberstone Farm – On Sunday, 26 June 1814, the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia and their suites halted on their way to Dover at Amberstone Farm, which, at the time, was in the hands of Samuel Rickman, whose son was born soon afterwards. The child was by imperial request, named Alexander.

<text>Lamb Chop is a sock puppet anthropomorphic sheep created by the puppeteer and ventriloquist Shari Lewis. The character first appeared during Lewis&#x27;s guest appearance on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in March 1956 and later appeared on &quot;Hi Mom&quot; (1957–1959), a local morning show that aired on WRCA-TV in New York, New York.

==History==
===Concept and creation===
Lamb Chop has been described as a &quot;6-year-old girl, very intuitive and very feisty, a combination of obstinacy and vulnerability...you know how they say fools rush in where wise men fear to go? Well, Lamb Chop would rush in, then scream for help.&quot; Lamb Chop, in all her shows, had referred to her close friend, a girl named Lolly Pincus.

From 1960 to 1963, Lewis had her own musical-comedy network television program, &quot;The Shari Lewis Show&quot;. As children&#x27;s programming turned more towards animation in the mid-1960s, she continued to perform in a wide range of venues. 

In 1992, Lamb Chop and Lewis began their own PBS children&#x27;s show, &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot;, an Emmy Award winner for five consecutive years. The show was approximately 25 minutes per episode. On PBS, it premiered September 10, 1992 and was last shown on January 1, 1997. From 2007 to 2009, it was shown on Qubo. 

In 1993, when Lewis appeared before the U.S. Congress in an oversight hearing on the Children&#x27;s Television Act, Lamb Chop provided her own testimony.

In 1998, Lamb Chop co-starred with Lewis on the short-lived spin-off &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;. The show was canceled after Lewis&#x27; death in 1998. The last episode of &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot; aired on January 17, 1999.

Prior to her death, Shari Lewis sold the rights of Lamb Chop to Golden Books Family Entertainment. When Golden filed for bankruptcy, Classic Media (later renamed DreamWorks Classics and now part of NBCUniversal) acquired Golden&#x27;s entertainment catalog.

=== Mallory Lewis reimagining ===
Two years after Lewis died in 1998, her daughter, producer and writer Mallory Lewis, began to perform with Lamb Chop. Mallory Lewis had worked closely with her mother when producing &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; and &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;. About her mother and Lamb Chop she said:

Shari Lewis&#x27;s other puppet, Hush Puppy, made his comeback at the Iowa State Fair in 2010. Until 2024 Mallory Lewis didn’t perform Charlie Horse, as doing his voice was hard on her vocal cords. He did make a comeback via social media videos in early 2024. Lewis&#x27;s daughter still owns the live performing rights to the Lamb Chop characters.

Mallory Lewis and Lamb Chop perform mainly for the US military. Lamb Chop is an honorary three-star general in the Marines.

In the first year&#x27;s collection of &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot; dailies, &quot;Out Whom Shall We Gross?&quot;, the August 31, 1993 strip quotes Lamb Chop as saying, &quot;A virtuous man&#x27;s honesty exists only in proportion to the pyre upon which he atones for it.&quot;

Mallory Lewis described Lamb Chop&#x27;s values as a &quot;liberal Jewish Democrat&quot;.

<doc id="1083737" wikidata="Q313313" url="?curid=1083737" title="M. N. Roy">
<text>Manabendra Nath Roy (born Narendra Nath Bhattacharya, better known as M. N. Roy; 21 March 1887 – 25 January 1954) was a 20th-century Indian revolutionary, philosopher, radical activist and political theorist. Roy was the founder of the Mexican Communist Party and the Communist Party of India (Tashkent group). 

He was also a delegate to the Communist International congresses and Russia&#x27;s aide to China. In the aftermath of World War II Roy moved away from orthodox Marxism to espouse the philosophy of radical humanism, attempting to chart a third course between liberalism and communism.

==Early life (1887–1910s)==

===Early years===

Narendra Nath &quot;Naren&quot; Bhattacharya was born on 21 March 1887 in Arbelia, North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, near Calcutta (Kolkata).

The Bhattacharyas were Sakta Brahmins – a family of hereditary priests. Roy&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the head priest of the goddess &quot;Kheputeswari&quot; in the village of Kheput, Midnapore district. His father Dinabandhu Bhattacharya also served as a priest before moving to the village of Arbelia with his 12 children.

Following the death of his first wife, Roy&#x27;s father married Basantakumari Devi, the niece of Dwarkanath Vidyabhushan. He then taught Sanskrit at a nearby school. The couple had a total of eight children, including the fourth-born Naren.

Roy&#x27;s early schooling took place at Arbelia. In 1898, the family moved to Kodalia and he continued his studies at the Harinavi Anglo-Sanskrit School, where his father taught, until 1905. He was considered tall, strong and athletic for his age.

He later enrolled at the National College under the tutelage of Sri Aurobindo, before studying at Bengal Technical Institute (now Jadavpur University) where he studied engineering and chemistry. However, much of Roy&#x27;s knowledge was gained through self-study.

===Indian independence movement===
Towards the end of the 19th century, revolutionary nationalism began to spread among the educated middle classes of Bengal, inspired by the writings of Bankim and Vivekananda.

According to one biographer, Roy agreed with Bankim that true religion was not being cloistered from the world, but working actively for the public good. Vivekananda reinforced this and advanced the idea that Hinduism and Indian culture were superior to anything the Western world could offer.

He formed a rationalist group with his cousin Hari Kumar Chakravarti (1882–1963). Members included Satkori Banerjee (Bandhopadhyay), brothers Saileshvar and Shyamsundar Bose, Roy&#x27;s cousins Phani and Narendra Chakravarti, and Mokshadacharan Samadhyayi, an organiser of the Anushilan Samiti in Chinsura.

In July 1905, the partition of Bengal was announced, scheduled to start in October. A mass movement aimed at annulling the partition emerged, giving radical nationalists like Roy an opportunity to build broader support. Following his high school expulsion for organising a meeting and a march against the partition, Roy and Chakravarti moved to Kolkata and joined the Anushilans.

Under Mokshada&#x27;s leadership, on 6 December 1907 Roy committed political theft to raise money for the Anushilans. When arrested, he was carrying two seditious books by Barin Ghosh. Defended by J. N. Roy (close friend of Bagha Jatin) and Promothonath Mukherjee, he was released on bail, thanks to his reputation as a student and social worker. 

Barin sent Prafulla Chaki with Charuchandra Datta to see Bagha Jatin at Darjeeling who was posted there on official duty, and do away with the Lt. Governor. On explaining to Prafulla that it was not the right time, Jatin promised to contact him later. Though Prafulla was impressed by him, Barin cynically commented that it would be too much effort for a government officer to serve a patriotic cause. Phani returned from Darjeeling and, fascinated by Jatin&#x27;s charisma, he informed his friends about him. On hearing Barin censuring Phani for disloyalty, Roy decided to meet Dada but was caught by Barin.

The &quot;Howrah-Shibpur Trial&quot; (1910–11) brought Bhattacharya closer to Jatindra Mukherjee.

===The Hindu-German conspiracy===
Many Indian nationalists, including Roy, became convinced that only through a revolution would they be able to achieve India&#x27;s independence from the British Empire. So revolutionary nationalists looked to a rival imperial power, that of Kaiser Wilhelm&#x27;s Germany, as a potential source for funds and weapons.

In August 1914, World War I began, affecting both the UK and Germany. Expatriate Indian nationalists organised as the Indian Revolutionary Committee in Berlin made an informal appeal to the German government to support a revolution in India. Towards the end of the year, the Germans had agreed to provide funding and material to start an uprising against British rule. Revolution seemed near.

The task of attaining said funding and material was entrusted to Roy. He was sent to Java, where over the next two months he was only able to obtain little funding and no armaments.

In early 1915, Roy set out again, leaving India to search for the German armaments which were believed to be en route somewhere in the Pacific. Roy would not see his homeland again for 16 years.

The plan seemed fantastic, as Roy later recounted in his posthumously published memoirs:

Last minute however, the money failed to materialise and the German Consul General had seemingly vanished the day when he was to issue orders for the plan, Roy recalls.

Disgusted but still holding out hope, Roy left Indonesia for Japan, hoping to win Japanese support for their cause, despite Japan&#x27;s nominal alliance with Great Britain. There he met with Chinese nationalist leader Sun Yat-sen, who had escaped to Japan following the failure of the July 1913 uprising in Nanking.

Sun Yat-sen refused to assist Roy in his task of organising an anti-British revolution in India, instead informing Roy that Japanese support would prove sufficient. His inability to assist was due to Hong Kong&#x27;s status as a British colony, Sun&#x27;s own base of operations. Efforts to raise money from the German Ambassador to China were likewise unsuccessful.

Roy&#x27;s activities soon drew the attention of the Japanese secret police. When he learned he was going to be served formal notice to leave Japan, not wishing to be deported to Shanghai, Roy immediately left the country and arrived in Korea.

He tried to make his way to Peking (Beijing), but he was identified by the British authorities, who detained him. However, he was able to escape jail time due to the British Consul General&#x27;s ill ease with holding a British subject indefinitely without formal charges.

Efforts to raise funds from the German consulate at Hankow resulted in a tentative agreement. However, this plan also failed due to the scale of the commitment, which had to be approved in Berlin according to Admiral Paul von Hintze. Roy decided to search for German funding from the German Ambassador in the United States, before heading to Germany. Employees of the German embassy were able to assist Roy in stowing away aboard a German-crewed American ship bound for San Francisco.

Although they knew he was on the ship, British colonial authorities stopping the vessel in international waters were unable to locate Roy hidden in a secret compartment. In an effort to throw the British off his trail, and in an effort to obtain more suitable accommodations for the long trans-Pacific voyage, Roy disembarked from Kobe, Japan.

In Kobe, he used a fake French-Indian passport previously obtained for him by the Germans in China. Posing as a seminary student bound for Paris, Roy obtained an American visa, bought a ticket, and sailed for San Francisco.

==Communist movement (1910s–1929)==


During his stay in Palo Alto, a period of about two months, Roy met his future wife, Evelyn Leonora Trent (alias Shanthi Devi). The pair fell in love and journeyed together across the country to New York City.

It was in the New York City public library that Roy began to develop his interest in Marxism. His socialist transition owed much to Bankim Chandra Chatterjee&#x27;s essays on communism and Vivekananda&#x27;s message of serving the proletariat. Due to the presence of British spies, Roy fled to Mexico in July 1917 with Evelyn. German military authorities, on the spot, gave him large amounts of money.

Mexican president Venustiano Carranza and other liberal thinkers appreciated Roy&#x27;s contributions to the &quot;El Pueblo&quot; newspaper. The Socialist Party he founded in December 1917 later became the Communist Party of Mexico in 1919, the first Communist Party outside Russia. The Roys lodged a penniless Mikhail Borodin under special circumstances. Due to Borodin&#x27;s grateful reports, Moscow planned to invite Roy to the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow during the summer of 1920.

A few weeks before the Congress, Vladimir Lenin warmly received Roy. At Lenin&#x27;s behest, Roy formulated his own ideas supplemented from Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and the Colonial Questions&quot;.

Roy&#x27;s writings were published by the &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; (Inprecor), the weekly bulletin of the Communist International. Roy served as a member of the Comintern&#x27;s Presidium for eight years and at one stage was the Political Secretariat, the executive committee, and the World Congress.

Commissioned by Lenin to prepare the East—especially India—for revolution, Roy founded military and political schools in Tashkent. In October 1920, as he formed the Communist Party of India, he contacted his revolutionary colleagues who, at this time, were determining allegiances between Radicalism (&quot;Jugantar&quot;) and Mohandas K. Gandhi&#x27;s novel programme.

Close to the &quot;Jugantar&quot; in spirit and action, C. R. Das inspired Roy&#x27;s confidence. From Moscow, Roy published his major reflections, &quot;India in Transition&quot;, which were translated into other languages. In 1922, Roy&#x27;s own journal, the &quot;Vanguard&quot;, was published. This was followed by &quot;The Future of Indian Politics&quot; (1926) and &quot;Revolution and Counter-revolution in China&quot; (1930), while he was moving between Germany and France.

Leading a Comintern delegation appointed by Joseph Stalin to develop an agrarian revolution in China, Roy reached Canton in February 1927. Despite fulfilling his mission, a disagreement between the CCP leaders and Borodin led to breakdown of communication. Roy returned to Moscow where Trotskyists and Zinovievists were fighting the Stalinists. Here he voted for Trotsky&#x27;s expulsion from the executive committee of the Comintern.

Stalin refused to meet Roy and give him a hearing at the plenum in February 1928. Denied treatment for an infected ear, Roy escaped with Nikolai Bukharin&#x27;s help, sparing himself from Stalin&#x27;s anger. Shortly after Trotsky&#x27;s deportation on 22 May 1928, Roy received permission to go abroad for medical treatment on board a Berlin-bound Deruluft plane. In December 1929, the Inprecor announced Roy&#x27;s expulsion from the Comintern, almost simultaneously with Bukharin&#x27;s fall from grace.

==In India (1930–1954)==
Roy returned to India for the first time in December 1930. Upon reaching Bombay, Roy met with Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose, the former of whom recalled that despite significant political differences, &quot;I was attracted to him by his remarkable intellectual capacity.&quot;

Roy&#x27;s political activity in India proved to be brief as on 21 July 1931 he was arrested in Bombay on an arrest warrant issued in 1924. Roy was taken to Kanpur to face charges under Section 121-A of the Indian Penal Code which was &quot;conspiring to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty in India.&quot;

No trial was held in open court; rather, the proceedings were conducted inside the jail in which Roy was held. Roy was allowed neither trial by jury nor defense witnesses, nor was he allowed to make a defense statement. Proceedings were conducted from 3 November 1931 until 9 January 1932 when Roy was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.

Roy was taken to the Bareilly Central Jail, however he was able to smuggle out the defence statement which he was not allowed to present in court. This disallowed declaration was published in full by Roy&#x27;s supporters in India as &quot;My Defence&quot;, and in abridged form in New York as &quot;I Accuse&quot;.

Roy was unapologetic for his views against British colonial rule, declaring:

Roy filed an appeal to the Allahabad High Court, but this was dismissed on 2 May 1933. Roy&#x27;s sentence was, however, reduced from 12 to 6 years. Roy ultimately served 5 years and 4 months, sitting in five different jails. Dismal prison conditions took a severe toll on Roy&#x27;s health, and he suffered lasting damage to his heart, kidneys, lungs, and digestive tract as a result of his time behind bars. Roy also lost several teeth, was frequently feverish, and suffered constant pain from a chronically infected inner ear.

Despite his imprisonment, Roy still managed to contribute to the Indian independence movement. A steady stream of letters and articles were smuggled out of jail. He also wrote a 3,000-page draft manuscript provisionally titled &quot;The Philosophical Consequence of Modern Science&quot;. His followers, including A. A. Alwe, formed the Bombay Provincial Working Class Party in 1933 to continue his work while he was imprisoned.

Released in November 1936 in bad health, Roy went to Allahabad for recovery. Defying the Comintern order to boycott the Indian National Congress, Roy urged Indian communists to join this Party. Jawaharlal Nehru, in his address at the Faizpur session in December 1936, described Roy as:

From the podium, Roy in his speech recommended the capture of power by &quot;Constituent Assembly&quot;. Unable to collaborate with Gandhi, however, Roy stuck to his own conviction. In April 1937, his weekly &quot;Independent India&quot; appeared and was welcomed by progressive leaders like Bose and Nehru, however was criticised by Gandhi and the staunch Communists who accused Roy of deviation.

==Personal life and Radical Humanism==
In marrying Ellen Gottschalk, his second wife, &quot;Roy found not only a loving wife but also an intelligent helper and close collaborator.&quot; They settled in Dehra Dun. Roy proposed an alternative leadership, seizing the crisis following Bose&#x27;s re-election as the Congress President in 1938. In Pune, he formed his &quot;League of Radical Congressmen&quot;. Disillusioned with both bourgeois democracy and communism, he devoted the last years of his life to the formulation of an alternative philosophy which he called &quot;Radical Humanism&quot; and of which he wrote a detailed exposition in &quot;Reason, Romanticism and Revolution&quot;.

In his biography, &quot;In Freedom&#x27;s Quest&quot;, Sibnarayan Ray writes: 

With the declaration of World War II, Roy (in a similar position as Sri Aurobindo) condemned the rising totalitarian regimes in Germany and Italy, instead supporting England and France in the fight against fascism. He severed connections with the Congress Party and created the Radical Democratic Party in 1940. Gandhi proceeded to lead the &quot;Quit India&quot; movement in August 1942. In response, the British colonial government imprisoned without trial nearly the entire Indian National Congress leadership. Roy&#x27;s views clearly differed from the mainstream of the independence movement. According to Roy, a victory for Germany and the Axis powers would have resulted in the end of democracy worldwide and that India would never be independent. In his view, India could only win her independence in a free world. 

Sensing India&#x27;s independence to be a post-war reality following the defeat of the Axis powers and the weakening of the British Empire, Roy wrote a series of articles in &quot;Independent India&quot; on the economic and political structures of the new India, presenting a ten-year plan, and drafting a &quot;Constitution of Free India&quot; (1944).

Roy in his philosophy devised means to ensure human freedom and progress. Remembering Bagha Jatin who &quot;personified the best of mankind&quot;, Roy worked &quot;for the ideal of establishing a social order in which the best in man could be manifest.&quot; In 1947, he elaborated his theses into a manifesto, &quot;New Humanism&quot;, expected to be as important as the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; by Karl Marx a century earlier.

==Death and legacy==
A planned lecture tour to the United States was canceled on 25 January 1954 due to Roy&#x27;s death from a heart attack.

Beginning in 1987, Oxford University Press began the publication of the &quot;Selected Works of M. N. Roy&quot;. A total of 4 volumes were published through to 1997, gathering Roy&#x27;s writings through his prison years. Project editor Sibnarayan Ray died in 2008, however, so the project was prematurely terminated. Noted personalities like T. M. Tarkunde, Govardhandas Parekh, V. B. Karnik, Sunil Bhattacharya, B. R. Sunthankar, Saleel Wagh, V. R. Jawahire and Dr. Nalini Taralekar were influenced by M. N. Roy and his philosophy.

<doc id="1083745" wikidata="Q747983" url="?curid=1083745" title="USS Columbia (SSN-771)">
<text>USS &quot;Columbia&quot; (SSN-771) is the 21st flight III, or Improved (688i) attack submarine of the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1995, the submarine is assigned to Submarine Squadron 7 and homeported in Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.

&quot;Columbia&quot; is the eighth U.S. warship to bear the name, though the first to be named for three cities: Columbia, Illinois, Columbia, Missouri and Columbia, South Carolina.

The contract to build &quot;Columbia&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 14 December 1988 and her keel was laid down on 21 April 1993. She was the 33rd &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class boat built by Electric Boat, and was launched on 24 September 1994 with the slide down a 1,300-foot wooden ramp, the last American submarine to do so, giving her the title of &quot;The Last Slider&quot;. &quot;Columbia&quot; was sponsored by Hillary Clinton, and commissioned on 9 October 1995.

== Service history ==
From March to May 1999, &quot;Columbia&quot; operated off the California coast, participating in exercises and making port visits.

In 2011, the submarine deployed to the Western Pacific Ocean (WestPac), including a port visit at Yokosuka, Japan.

In May 2014, &quot;Columbia&quot; left on another western Pacific deployment, again stopping in Yokosuka on 5 November and returning to her homeport of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on 21 November.

In 2016, &quot;Columbia&quot; deployed on a six-month patrol in the western Pacific, making port visits at Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan, and Guam.

In 2018, the sub made another WestPac deployment, stopping at Yokosuka in May.

In October 2018, the submarine began a mid-life overhaul at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. She left dry dock on 16 July 2020 and returned to the Navy on 17 May 2021.

In September 2021, &quot;Columbia&quot; participated in the 62nd annual UNITAS exercise off South America.

=== 2019 shooting ===
On 4 December 2019, while &quot;Columbia&quot; was in dry dock, a crew member on guard duty shot and killed two civilian employees and injured another before shooting and killing himself. Machinist&#x27;s Mate Auxiliary Fireman Gabriel Romero, 22, used duty weapons issued to him as a member of the submarine&#x27;s Topside Roving Patrol. Later investigation by the Navy determined that Romero was &quot;likely unfit&quot; for service on a submarine and that officers and senior enlisted sailors aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; had failed to recognize and coordinate action on his deteriorating mental state.

==Awards==
In July 2015, the ship was awarded the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy, as the Pacific Fleet ship that improved the most in the previous year, based on the Battle Efficiency Competition.

==Future U.S. submarine of the name==

On 25 July 2016, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced that the lead ship of the planned of ballistic missile submarines would also be named , after the District of Columbia. This raised the possibility that the attack sub &quot;Columbia&quot; might still be in active service when the new ballistic missile sub was commissioned in 2031, although the attack sub would be 37 years old by that point. As of 2022, 36 &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class boats have been retired, and only three were in service longer than 37 years.

On 3 June 2022, the Navy announced that the new sub would be named USS &quot;District of Columbia&quot; to eliminate the possibility that two ships in commission might bear the same name, which is forbidden by federal law.

<text>Joseph Michael Schenck (; December 25, 1876 – October 22, 1961) was a Russian-born American film studio executive.

==Life and career==
Schenck was born to a Jewish family in Rybinsk, Yaroslavl Oblast, Russian Empire. He emigrated to New York City on July 19, 1892, under the name Ossip Schenker; and with his younger brother Nicholas eventually got into the entertainment business, operating concessions at New York&#x27;s Fort George Amusement Park. Recognizing the potential, in 1909 the Schenck brothers purchased Palisades Amusement Park and afterward became participants in the fledgling motion picture industry in partnership with Marcus Loew, operating a chain of movie theaters.

In 1916, through his involvement in the film business, Joseph Schenck met and married Norma Talmadge, a top young star with Vitagraph Studios. He would be the first of her three husbands, but she was his only wife. Schenck supervised, controlled and nurtured her career in alliance with her mother. In 1917, the couple formed the Norma Talmadge Film Corporation, which became a lucrative enterprise. They divorced in 1934; Schenck then built a home in Palm Springs, California.

After parting ways with his brother, Joseph Schenck moved to the West Coast where the future of the film industry seemed to lie. Within a few years Schenck was made the second president of the new United Artists.

The Political Graveyard reports that he was an alternate delegate from California to the 1928 Republican National Convention.

In 1933, he partnered with Darryl F. Zanuck to form Twentieth Century Pictures to produce motion pictures for United Artists, until 20th Century merged with Fox Film in 1935. As chairman of the new 20th Century Fox, he was one of the most powerful and influential people in the film business. Caught in a payoff scheme to buy peace with the militant unions, he was convicted of income tax evasion and spent time in prison. He was granted a presidential pardon by Harry Truman in 1945. Following his release, he returned to 20th Century Fox where he became infatuated with the then unknown Marilyn Monroe, and played a key role in launching her career.

==Honors==
One of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in 1952 he was given a special Academy Award in recognition of his contribution to the development of the film industry. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6757 Hollywood Blvd.

==Death==
Schenck retired in 1957 and shortly afterwards suffered a stroke, from which he never fully recovered. He died in Los Angeles, California, in 1961 at the age of 84, and was interred in Maimonides Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="1083768" wikidata="Q1358271" url="?curid=1083768" title="Mindhunters">
<text>Mindhunters is a 2004 American crime slasher film directed by Renny Harlin and starring Kathryn Morris, LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Patricia Velásquez, Clifton Collins Jr., Christian Slater, and Val Kilmer. It was written by Wayne Kramer and Kevin Brodbin with an uncredited rewrite by Ehren Kruger. Unusually, the last country to receive this film was the United States in 2005, because of the film&#x27;s distribution rights being changed from 20th Century Fox to Dimension Films.

In the film, a group of FBI profilers in training are tasked with tracking a serial killer to pass their exam. But they find themselves targeted by an actual killer. The team suspect that one of their members is their enemy, hiding among them.

==Plot==
Profiler Jake Harris is the instructor of the Mindhunters, a group of FBI agents training as profilers. His training approach consists of assigning them variants of real investigations, including sets, props, and actors, to play out each scenario. Alongside Harris is J.D., an experienced agent leading the group.

The group travels to an island off the coast of North Carolina to complete their final training exercise. There, they are joined by Gabe, a skilled profiler and outside observer who requested to see Harris&#x27;s teaching methods in action. The Navy uses the island to train for hostage rescue and outbreak scenarios; it features target dummies, vehicles on mechanical rails, and small-town storefronts. Harris plans on using the town for their final exam, tracking serial killer &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;.

The following morning, the group finds a dead cat with a broken pocket watch in its mouth. Later, during the investigation of the &quot;puppeteer&quot; scenario, J.D. dies after triggering a mechanism that causes a tank of liquid nitrogen (mislabeled as helium) to freeze him instantly. Realizing that J.D.&#x27;s death was intentional, the group tries to leave the island, but their boat explodes before they can board. At the base, the group realizes that the broken watches and clocks found at each scene point to the fact that there is a real killer nearby who has co-opted the exercise and is hunting them down. The killer&#x27;s M.O. indicates that they plan to kill someone at a time designated by the broken clocks. After a search of the island reveals nobody else present, the group concludes that the killer must be one of them.

Suspicions initially point to Gabe, as Mindhunter Lucas found maps and documents of the island in his luggage. While confronting him, they all pass out as their coffee has been drugged. They awaken to discover that the killer murdered Mindhunter Rafe, draining his blood and leaving his severed head on a table. Gabe later saves Mindhunter Vince from another trap involving broken water pipes and electrocution. A secondary trap kills Mindhunter Bobby when he goes to turn off the water. They then discover that the killer wrote letters on their cloths that spell out Croatoan, the Roanoke Colony that disappeared, making them realize that the killer is only looking to be infamous.

Mindhunter Nicole becomes the next to die after smoking a cigarette laced with acid. The island&#x27;s speakers start broadcasting a taunting message from Harris, making the group realize that he is in the island. Gabe, Lucas and Mindhunter Sara search for Harris, only to find him and two other agents dead in a hidden storefront. Harris has been strung up to wires from the ceiling as a marionette. The three turn on each other after triggering another trap, and Lucas is shot during the ensuing confrontation. Vince eventually is trapped in a freezer and dies when his gun backfires on him, as the killer sabotaged it.

Gabe later ambushes Sara. In the ensuing fight, Gabe overpowers Sara before being attacked by Lucas. Sara eventually hits Gabe with a fire extinguisher and subdues him. Lucas reveals that he was wearing a bulletproof vest, allowing him to survive getting shot. Sara thinks that she found a way to get one step ahead of the killer. Knowing that the killer was relying on timed mechanisms and remotes, as well as enjoying watching their anxiety under pressure, she changed a clock to appear slow by fifteen minutes, and covered it in a powder that glows phosphorescently under blacklight. Reasoning that the killer would not be able to resist setting the clock to the correct time, she grabs a black light, finding the marking powder on Lucas&#x27; hands. Lucas confesses that he killed his parents. Struggling to find more thrilling targets, he joined the FBI and planned to kill his fellow profilers, the only people he thought would be &quot;worthy prey&quot;. Lucas tries to drown Sara, who eventually kicks him into the water.

The two struggle and recover their weapons underwater, though she manages to shoot Lucas dead before he can kill her. Gabe recovers from his wounds, and when morning arrives, he and Sara flag down a U.S. Navy helicopter to leave the island.

==Production==
Wayne Kramer sold the original spec screenplay of &quot;Mindhunters&quot; to 20th Century Fox. The title of his screenplay was originally called &quot;Unsub&quot; (Unknown Subject), but Fox executives preferred the title &quot;Mindhunters&quot; and changed it before the deal was announced to the entertainment press. Kramer never felt comfortable with the title change because there was already a non-fiction book by John Douglas called &quot;&quot;.

Renny Harlin was originally attached to direct the film adaptation of &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; based on Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story, but left to helm this movie instead. Gerard Butler was set to the play the role of Lucas Harper, but dropped out to star in &quot;Timeline&quot;. Ryan Phillippe was also considered for the part, before Jonny Lee Miller eventually signed on. Phillippe&#x27;s then-wife, Reese Witherspoon, was offered to play Sara Moore, but she turned it down and Kathryn Morris was later cast. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Gary Busey were all offered the part of Jake Harris, but they rejected the film before Val Kilmer agreed to do the movie.

&quot;Mindhunters&quot; was filmed entirely in the Netherlands. Locations included Amsterdam (Amsterdam-Noord), The Hague, Delft, beach town Zandvoort, training village of the Police Academy in Ossendrecht and Radio Kootwijk on the Veluwe heath lands in the Gelderland province. Post-production of the film was moved to England to decrease the budget. Filming and production went from January to September 2002, yet the film was not released until 2004 (2005 in the USA). During the editing process, Harlin toned down much of the violence, in order to secure a PG-13 rating in the United States, yet the MPAA felt that the overall tone of the film was too dark and still issued it an R; following this Harlin reinserted the deleted scenes.

==Box office==
The film was a box office letdown, making only $4,476,235 domestically against a production budget of $27 million.

==Reception==
&quot;Mindhunters&quot; received generally negative reviews and it currently holds a 24% rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: &quot;A retread of &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; that lacks the source material&#x27;s wit.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses an average of the critics&#x27; reviews, the film scored 33/100, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert, of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave &quot;Mindhunters&quot; 2½ stars. His comments were: &quot;I will leave you with only one clue. In &#x27;House of Wax&#x27;, which opened last week, the movie theater is playing &#x27;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&#x27;. In this movie, the theater marquee advertises &#x27;The Third Man&#x27;. No, the male characters are not numbered in order, so you can&#x27;t figure it out that way, nor is the killer necessarily a woman. So think real hard. What else do you know about &#x27;The Third Man&#x27;? If you have never seen &#x27;The Third Man&#x27;, I urge you to rent it immediately, as a preparation (or substitute) for &#x27;Mindhunters&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="1083771" wikidata="Q1571933" url="?curid=1083771" title="Sunday Trading Act 1994">
<text>The Sunday Trading Act 1994 (c. 20) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom governing the right of shops in England and Wales to trade on a Sunday. Buying and selling on Sunday had previously been illegal, with exceptions, under the Shops Act 1950.

==Background==
Following the defeat of the Shops Bill 1986, which would have enabled widespread Sunday trading, compromise legislation was introduced in July 1994 in England and Wales, coming into force on 26 August 1994, allowing shops to open, but restricting opening times of larger stores i.e. those over to a maximum of six hours, between 10:00-18:00 only. Large retail park shops usually open 11:00-17:00, with supermarkets more usually choosing 10:00-16:00. In Central London, for example on Oxford Street, many shops choose to open from 12:00-18:00. This includes large 24-hour supermarkets, which meant that supermarkets have to close on Saturday night to allow six continuous hours of shopping within the allotted time.

However, some of the stores open half an hour earlier to allow people to &quot;browse&quot;, but do not allow sales before the allotted time. Deliveries to the large stores are not permitted to be loaded or unloaded before 09:00. Large shops were excluded from opening on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day (when it fell on a Sunday), but the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 made it illegal for large shops to open on Christmas Day regardless of whatever day of the week it falls upon.

Shops in Scotland, where Sunday trading had always been generally unregulated, retained the right to open at any time. However, the right for workers in Scotland to refuse to work on a Sunday was later conferred by the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003. Northern Ireland has separate laws governing Sunday opening.

The Sunday Trading Bill had met with considerable opposition from the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society and other groups such as the Keep Sunday Special campaign, a coalition body which includes the shopworkers&#x27; trade union USDAW. USDAW finally agreed to support six-hour Sunday trading in return for a promise that Sunday working would be strictly voluntary. This decision played an important role in encouraging many Labour MPs to back the bill in a free vote. They asked for a guarantee of premium pay, but the Government&#x27;s position was that that was a matter for negotiation between shopworkers or their unions and their employers and the Act says nothing about the rate of pay for Sunday working.

==2012 suspension==
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games, the Sunday Trading (London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games) Act 2012 was passed stipulating that Sunday trading laws would be suspended by the government on eight weekends from 22 July during the Olympics and Paralympics. This was a temporary measure, and the relaxation expired at the end of the summer.

==Ongoing debate==
The debate over Sunday trading laws was reignited in 2014, when a ComRes poll commissioned by pressure group &#x27;Open Sundays&#x27; revealed that 72% of people believe they should be able to shop whenever is convenient to them. The debate gained further political traction in May of the same year, when Philip Davies MP tabled five amendments to the Deregulation Bill which aimed at abolishing or liberalising the current Sunday trading laws. Although these amendments were ultimately rejected, the debate continued to receive attention, with Davies appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Daily Politics&quot; on 2 July 2014 and labelling the current regulations as &quot;completely absurd and unjustifiable&quot;.

It was proposed in the July 2015 Budget that the Sunday trading laws might be relaxed and shops over be able to open longer. However this proposal was defeated in a House of Commons vote.

==Exemptions==
Some categories of large shops are exempt from the Sunday Trading Act 1994:

*Airport shops
*Pharmacies
*Goods from exhibition stalls
*Farm shops that sell their own produce (including fishmongers)
*Petrol filling stations
*Railway stations
*Motorway service stations

Small shops with a floor area of under and up to 280 square metres (3,000 square feet) may open if they wish to.

<text>The Chicago Storm was an indoor soccer team in the Major Indoor Soccer League from 2004 to 2008 and the Xtreme Soccer League in 2009. The team folded after playing in a local indoor league, the Ultimate Soccer League.

==History==
The Storm played home games during its first two seasons at the UIC Pavilion on the West Side of Chicago. Former Chicago Sting and Chicago Fire soccer great Frank Klopas coached the team during its first two seasons, and Ted Chronopoulos captained the team for their inaugural 2004 season. Chicago Sting leading scorer Karl-Heinz Granitza worked for the club&#x27;s front office in 2005. In 2005–06, the Storm started the season with a 2–6 record but improved over the second half of the season to make the play-offs.

With attendance an issue, the team moved its home games to the newly built Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, a northwest suburb of Chicago, for the 2006–07 season. Steve Morris, a former Illinois soccer player of the year, replaced Klopas as coach for the 2006–07 season.

The Storm had a developmental team in 2008 called the Tormenta. They made the playoffs that year despite a late season slide, but lost to Monterrey in the quarterfinals after losing on a golden goal.

After the MISL folded, the Storm played in the Xtreme Soccer League. After the XSL folded with just one year of play, the Storm joined the Ultimate Soccer League.

<doc id="1083785" wikidata="Q7883641" url="?curid=1083785" title="Underground Literary Alliance">
<text>The Underground Literary Alliance is a Philadelphia-based and internationally membered group of writers, zinesters and DIY writers. They seek to expose what they see as the corruption and insularity in the American book-publishing establishment while providing alternative avenues for writers who don&#x27;t easily fit into mainstream institutions and agendas.

Among many other activities, they have gained considerable attention for their exposure of an insular literary practice whereby establishment authors serve on juries to award monetary prizes to their writing friends. In particular they have been able to point out cases where the prizewinning authors are in fact already wealthy, and thus can be seen as taking money from other authors who actually need it.

In general the ULA favors direct, vernacular writing over the more cryptic and mannered styles of the present-day academy. They present their literary aesthetic in their communal lit-zine, &quot;Slush Pile&quot;.

A quote from Karl Wenclas, the organization&#x27;s Publicity Director: &quot;The Underground Literary Alliance is the most controversial writers&#x27; group in America. We stand up for writers, expose corruption in the publishing world, and work to create a fun &amp; exciting alternative to the literary mainstream.&quot;

==History==
The Underground Literary Alliance has its roots in the independent zine scene that flourished in the 1990s. The founders of the group were zinesters who connected with each other through &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Guide to the Underground Press&quot; or through other underground writers. These founders, and their zines, were: Karl Wenclas, &quot;New Philistine&quot;; Michael Jackman, &quot;inspector 18&quot;; Steve Kostecke, &quot;Seoul in Slices&quot;; Joe Smith, &quot;The Die&quot;; Ann Sterzinger, &quot;Bottle-Fed&quot;; and Doug Bassett, a literary theorist. The six of them met in Hoboken, New Jersey, in October, 2000, in order to launch the group and commence their activism by signing a statement of protest against a Guggenheim grant given to Rick Moody, an already-wealthy writer. The text of the statement read as follows:

&quot;We the undersigned protest the year 2000 Guggenheim grant to well-known author Rick Moody, because it exemplifies the practice of giving financial assistance to already successful and affluent writers, well-connected, who clearly don’t need the help—while other writers abjectly struggle—and because this runs counter to the implicit charitable purpose behind the tax-exempt status of a foundation like John Simon Guggenheim.&quot;

In addition to the six who met in Hoboken, this protest was later signed by over 30 other zinesters. It was also sent out to approximately 300 of the American lit world’s biggest-named writers, editors, and agents—but none of them signed.

Since its founding, the ULA has constantly engaged in its own brand of “literary activism” which has gained the group a notoriety for exposing what they see as corruption in the American literary world and for harshly criticizing corporate-promulgated literary fiction.

Current ULA members include Patrick Simonelli, editor of litvision.org, Leopold McGinnis, author of &quot;Game Quest&quot;, Tom Hendricks, creator of the Zine Hall of Fame, and poet Frank Walsh.

The ULA launched its own independent press in 2006.

As of December 1, 2010, the Underground Literary Alliance appeared disbanded, with no viable webpage. Co-founder Steve Kostecke died in April 2011.

==Literary activism==
===Guggenheim grant protest===
In late 2000, the six founders of the ULA signed a protest against the $35,000 Guggenheim grant awarded to Rick Moody, an already-wealthy author.

===Debate with George Plimpton &amp; The Paris Review===
In early 2001, the ULA held a press conference at CBGBs in New York City which was attended by George Plimpton, staffers at &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, and staffers of &quot;Open City&quot; magazine. The ULA debated with those who attended about what they perceive to be the irrelevancy and lack of integrity of the current realm of corporate/academia-sponsored literature.

===KGB Crash===
In early 2001, the ULA crashed a literati reading at KGB in New York City. The members present disrupted the reading with arguments about how literature has died under the current corporate system – and were then thrown out of the venue.

===Firecracker Awards===
Late 2001, the ULA protested against &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly Concern&quot; being awarded Best Zine of the Year by the Firecracker Alternative Books Award because they felt McSweeney’s did not fit an accepted definition of zine.

===Perceived Cronyism in the Lit World===
The ULA protested the 2002 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) award of $20,000 to Jonathan Franzen, an already-wealthy author and highly publicized best-selling author of &quot;The Corrections&quot;. Rick Moody was on the NEA panel, and the ULA contested that this was an example of the literati insularly awarding each other.

===Housing Works===
In early 2003, members of the ULA were kicked out of a reading at Housing Works in New York City for requesting a discussion of issues, including a looming war. They stated that they were confronting the writers about what they saw as a lack of social or political relevancy to the stories being read that night.

===Amazon.com &amp; the New York Times Article===
In early 2004, a glitch at Amazon.com revealed that Dave Eggers (of McSweeney’s and &quot;The Believer&quot; magazine) had posted an anonymous response to reviews he believed were posted by ULA members (as reported by the New York Times). David Eggers suggested that a series of negative reviews at amazon.com were the result of ULA members retaliating against an article about them in &quot;The Believer&quot;. As a policy, the ULA does nothing anonymously, and says the negative reviews were not posted by members of the ULA.

===Howl Protest &amp; the Associated Press Podcast===
In April 2006, the ULA protested against the reading of Allen Ginsberg’s &quot;Howl&quot; at Miller Theater at Columbia University, which was hosted by elite literati and had no representation of the &quot;underground&quot;, from which the Beat Generation had sprung. The AP covered the protest and reported on it by means of a podcast.

===Peter Matthiessen and the CIA Connection===
In January, 2007, the New York Times reported that Peter Matthiessen had been working for the CIA at the time of the founding of the Paris Review, and that for two years he used the magazine as his cover. This article publicized the fact first revealed by Matthiessen himself to author Frances Stonor Saunders in her 1999 book &quot;The Cultural Cold War.&quot; The ULA also reported the connection between the CIA and Matthiessen, in May, 2005, in an article by Richard Cummings, who has described himself as &quot;a member of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, having served on the Board of the AFIO-New England chapter.&quot; The ULA article also went on to allege that The Paris Review exercised covert influence over the London Review of Books.

<text>Old Man&#x27;s Lake, also known as Bilsland Lake, is a small lake near Magnetawan, in the Almaguin Highlands, Parry Sound District, Ontario, Canada. It is spring fed and hosts a handful of cottages. The lake drains over a small waterfall into Ahmic Lake.

Old Man&#x27;s Lake received its name because, the story goes, the area once was divided into three large farms. Two farms were owned by two sons and the “Old Man” had the other. His house was on the east shore. The farm still exists today (although it is much smaller).

==Ecology==
Old Man&#x27;s Lake has a diverse fish population including smallmouth bass and yellow perch.

<doc id="1083790" wikidata="Q1403224" url="?curid=1083790" title="Felipe Quispe">
<text>Felipe Quispe Huanca &quot;Mallku&quot; (Quechua language: &quot;condor&quot;), (22 August 1942 – 19 January 2021) was a Bolivian historian and political leader. He headed the Pachakuti Indigenous Movement (MIP) and was general secretary of the United Union Confederation of Working Peasants of Bolivia (CSUTCB).

== Biography ==
Quispe founded the Tupak Katari Indian Movement in 1979 and the Tupak Katari Guerrilla Army in 1990. His honorific name, Mallku, refers to the spirit of the mountains that surround and protect the People, and therefore is the source of life. &quot;Mallku&quot; means &quot;peak&quot; both in geography and in hierarchy.

In 1984, he was one of the leading organisers of the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, a failed armed insurrection against the government. Quispe was arrested for his involvement in the movement on August 19, 1992. Quispe has worked for the establishment of a Tawantinsuyu republic — which would take the name &quot;Collasuyu&quot; — in the Aymara-majority regions of Bolivia.

Quispe was a staunch opponent of the neoliberal Washington consensus, and was also strongly against U.S.-led schemes toward coca eradication, which he sees as destroying a critical part of Aymara culture. He was involved heavily in the Bolivian Gas War.

Quispe ran failed campaigns in the 2002 and 2005 presidential elections, which saw the victory of indigenous Evo Morales, leader of MAS (Movimiento al socialismo). Quispe was a vocal critic of Morales&#x27; government, characterising it as representing &quot;neoliberalism with an Indian face&quot;.

Quispe died on 19 January 2021 in El Alto from cardiac arrest.

<text>Narayana (, ) is one of the forms and epithets of Vishnu. In this form, the deity is depicted in yogic slumber under the celestial waters, symbolising the masculine principle and associated with his role of creation. He is also known as Purushottama, and is considered the Supreme Being in Vaishnavism.

== Etymology ==
Narayan Aiyangar states the meaning of the Sanskrit word &#x27;Narayana&#x27; can be traced back to the Laws of Manu (also known as the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, a &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot; text), which states:

This definition is used throughout post-Vedic literature such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;. &#x27;Narayana&#x27; is also defined as the &#x27;son of the primeval man&#x27;, and &#x27;Supreme Being who is the foundation of all men&#x27;.

*&#x27;Nara&#x27; (Sanskrit नार) means &#x27;water&#x27; and &#x27;man&#x27;
*&#x27;Yana&#x27; (Sanskrit यान) means &#x27;vehicle&#x27;, &#x27;vessel&#x27;, or more loosely, &#x27;abode&#x27; or &#x27;home&#x27;

L. B. Keny proposes that Narayana was associated with the Dravidian, and ultimately, the Indus Valley Civilisation, prior to his syncretism with Vishnu. To this end, he states that the etymology of the deity is associated with the Dravidian &quot;nara&quot;, meaning ‘water’, &quot;ay&quot;, which in Tamil means &quot;to lie in a place&quot;, and &quot;an&quot;, which is the masculine termination in Dravidian languages. He asserts that this is also the reason why Narayana is represented as lying on a serpent in the sea. He quotes, &quot;This Nārāyana of the Āryan pantheon seems to be the supreme being of the Mohenjo-Darians, a god who was probably styled Ān, a name still kept in Tamil literature as Āndivanam, the prototype of the historic Siva&quot;.

==Description==

In the &quot;Vedas&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;, Narayana is described as having the divine blackish-blue color of water-filled clouds, four-armed, holding a Padma (lotus), Kaumodaki gada (mace), Panchajanya shankha (conch), and Sudarshana chakra (discus).

=== Hinduism ===

As stated in the epic &quot;Itihāsa,&quot; the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;:

As per texts like the &quot;Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Garuda Purana, and the Padma Purana&quot;, Narayana is Vishnu himself, who incarnates in various avatars.

According to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, he is also the &quot;Guru of the Universe&quot;. The Bhagavata Purana declares Narayana as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who engages in the creation of 14 worlds within the universe Brahma who is Deity of rajas-guna, himself sustains, maintains and preserves the universe as Vishnu by accepting sattva-guna. Narayana himself annihilates the universe at the end of &quot;Maha-Kalpa&quot; as Kalagni Rudra who is presiding deity of tamas-guna.

According to the &quot;Bhagavata Purana, Purusha Sukta, Narayana Sukta,&quot; and the &quot;Narayana Upanishad&quot; from the &quot;Vedas,&quot; he is the ultimate soul.

According to Madhvacharya, Narayana is one of the five vyuhas of Vishnu, which are cosmic emanations of God, in contrast to his incarnate avatars. Madhvacharya separates Vishnu&#x27;s manifestations into two groups: Vishnu&#x27;s vyuhas (emanations) and His avataras (incarnations). The Vyuhas have their basis in the Pancharatras, a sectarian text that was accepted as authoritative by both the Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita schools of Vedanta. They are mechanisms by which the universe is ordered, was created, and evolves. Narayana possesses the chatur-vyuha aspects of Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, who evolve one after the other in the development of the universe. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Krishna is also synonymous with Narayana and Arjuna is referred to as Nara. The epic identifies them both in plural &#x27;Krishnas&#x27;, or as part incarnations of the earlier incarnations of Vishnu, recalling their mystical identity as Nara-Narayana.

Narayana (as Krishna) is also described in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; as having a universal form (&quot;Vishvarupa&quot;) which is beyond the ordinary limits of human perception or imagination.

In the &quot;Narayana Sukta&quot;, Narayana is essentially the supreme force and/or essence of all: &quot;&#x27;Nārāyaṇa parabrahman tatvam Nārāyaṇa paraha&#x27;.&quot;

Narayana&#x27;s eternal and supreme abode beyond the material universe is Vaikuntha, a realm of bliss and happiness called Paramapada, which means the final or highest place for liberated souls, where they enjoy bliss and happiness for eternity in the company of the supreme lord. Vaikuntha is situated beyond the material universe and hence, cannot be perceived or measured by material science or logic. Sometimes, Kshira Sagara, where Narayana or Vishnu rests on Shesha in his reclining &quot;ananta shayana&quot; form, is also perceived as &quot;Vaikuntha&quot; within the material universe.

The &quot;Śruti&quot; texts mention Narayana as the primordial being who was present even when Brahma and Ishana (Shiva) were not present. He is conceived as the Supreme Soul in the texts.

===Buddhism===
The &quot;Mahāsamaya Sutta&quot; (DN 20) of the Pali Canon mentions a deity by the name &quot;Veṇhu&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Viṣṇu&quot;), though the text suggests that this name may also signify a class of deva. He also appears in the &quot;Veṇḍu Sutta&quot; (SN 2.12) as &quot;Veṇḍu&quot; where he addresses Gautama Buddha by celebrating the joy experienced by those who follow the Dhamma. He also makes brief mention of Manu.

Mahayana Buddhism elaborates on the character of this deity, where he is often called &quot;Nārāyaṇa&quot; (; ) or more rarely, &quot;Narasiṃha&quot; () and &quot;Vāsudeva&quot; (). Literature often depicts him as a Vajradhara (). He is present in the Womb Realm Mandala and is among the twelve guardian devas of the Diamond Realm Mandala. He is associated with Śrāvaṇa in esoteric astrology. His queen consort is Nārāyaṇī. He is said to have been born from Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s heart. The Buddhas are sometimes described as having a firm vajra body like Nārāyaṇa.

The &quot;Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra&quot; describes him as having three faces with a greenish-yellow complexion. He holds a wheel in his right hand and rides upon a garuḍa. Chapter 6 of the &quot;Yiqiejing Yinyi&quot; explains that he belongs to the Kāmadhātu and is venerated for the acquisition of power. Chapter 41 adds that he has eight arms that wield various &quot;Dharma weapons&quot; (&quot;dharmāyudha&quot;) with which he subjugates the asuras.

He appears as an interlocutor in several Mahayana sutras, including the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Sarvapuṇyasamuccayasamādhi Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā Dhāraṇī&quot;.

He is also mentioned in several places in the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot;, one of the &quot;Sutras&quot; that describe the life of Gautama Buddha. It is said that because the Buddha is &quot;endowed with the great strength of Nārāyaṇa, he is called the great Nārāyaṇa himself.&quot;

The Chinese Manichaean manuscript &quot;Moni Guangfo&quot;, a syncretic religious text incorporating both Buddhist and Manichaean elements, considers Nārāyaṇa () to be one of the Five Buddhas, with the other buddhas being Zoroaster, Śākyamuni, Jesus, and Mani.

=== Jainism ===
Balabhadra and &quot;Narayana&quot; are mighty half-brothers, who appear nine times in each half of the time cycles of the Jain cosmology and jointly rule half the earth as half-chakravarti. Ultimately &quot;Prati-naryana&quot; is killed by &quot;Narayana&quot; for his unrighteousness and immorality. Narayana are extremely powerful and are as powerful as 2 Balabhadras. Chakravartins are as powerful as 2 Narayanas. Hence Narayanas become half-chakravartins. Tirthankaras are much more powerful than Chakravartins. In Jain &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, there is a friendly duel between cousin brothers Neminatha (Tirthankara) and Krishna (Naryana) in which Neminath lost to Krishna without any effort at all. There is also a story of Neminatha lifting the conch of Krishna and blowing it without any effort. The Jain &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes Krishna&#x27;s conflict with Jarasandha, who he kills.

==Literature==

Narayana is hailed in certain parts of the &quot;Vedas&quot; like the &quot;Narayana Suktam&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Suktam&quot;. He is also hailed in selective Vaishnava &quot;Upanishads&quot; like the &quot;Narayana Upanishad&quot;, &quot;Mahanarayana Upanishad&quot;, and the &quot;Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad&quot;.

The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; relates an episode where Narayana grants Rudra (Shiva) a boon. The destroyer deity seeks two boons. Firstly, he wishes to be the greatest of the devotees of Narayana, as well as bearing the reputation of the same throughout the world. Secondly, he desires the ability to offer salvation to whoever seeks refuge in him.

The prowess of Narayana is described in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;:

Ramanuja&#x27;s prayer of surrender to Narayana in the &quot;Sharanagati Gadyam&quot; of the &quot;Tiruvaymoli&quot; was and is significant to his Sri Vaishnava adherents, as it became a model prayer for future generations. In this prayer, Ramanuja describes Narayana to be the &quot;beloved consort of Sri and of Bhumi and Nila&quot;. He is stated to reside in his abode of Vaikuntha, where he assumes the role of the creation, preservation, as well as the destruction of the universe. Narayana is extolled to be the same as the Ultimate Reality, Brahman. He is regarded to be the refuge of all creation, the master of spiritual as well as material entities, as well as the dispeller of the miseries of his devotees. He ends his prayer by saluting Narayana and his consort Sri, to whom he surrenders to his &quot;lotus-like feet&quot;.

<text>Child&#x27;s Play is a charitable organization that donates toys and games to children&#x27;s hospitals worldwide. It was founded in 2003 by Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins, authors of the popular video games-related webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. The charity is seen as a way to refute mainstream media&#x27;s perception of gamers as violent and antisocial. As of 2022, Child&#x27;s Play had processed over $55,147,529.24 in donations since its inception.

== Logistics ==
With the help of hospital staff, Child&#x27;s Play sets up gift wishlists on Amazon.com, full of video games, books, toys and movies. These wishlists send items directly to the facilities as in-kind donations. Instead of buying items off the wishlists users can donate money through PayPal or check. This money is used to make annual wholesale purchases to provide technology like iPads and Xbox systems as well as games and movies.

The charity also has a space for corporate sponsors who have donated. The sponsors also earn a corporate sponsorship level (Silver, Gold and Platinum) and get linked back on Childsplaycharity.org. These sponsors include several video game marathons such as the Mario Marathon and Desert Bus for Hope, as well as YouTube series such as Far Lands or Bust by Kurtjmac.

== History ==
Child&#x27;s Play was announced on November 24, 2003, by the authors of Penny Arcade as a challenge to their readership, and as a response to the often negative portrayal of video gamers in the media, most notably a HeraldNet article by Bill France entitled &quot;Violent video games are training children to kill.&quot; (France later made an apology in the same column, praising the effort.) It received positive press on many popular weblogs, including Slashdot and received direct endorsement from Wil Wheaton. In less than one month of publicity and operation, the charity raised over $250,000 in cash and toys for the Children&#x27;s Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.

In 2004, the charity was expanded and partnered with children&#x27;s hospitals in Seattle; Oakland, California; San Diego, California; Houston, Texas; and Washington, D.C.

By January 5, 2005, when the final numbers for 2004 were tabulated, the charity had raised over $310,000 ($60,000 more than the previous year), and gained forty corporate sponsors in the process. Among these sponsors were Nintendo, Midway Games, Cerulean Studios, and THQ.

In 2005, the charity was again expanded to partner with an additional seven children&#x27;s hospitals across the United States, as well as children&#x27;s hospitals in Toronto and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is also partnered with Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital in Liverpool, England. At the time when they stopped accepting donations, the community had raised $605,000. There was an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 Child&#x27;s Play Charity Dinner. The winning bid of $20,000 was placed by Christian Boggs. Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid on an original pencil sketch of the PAX 2005 program cover on eBay. 100% of the profits went to the American Red Cross.

In 2006, the charity was further expanded, adding four hospitals in the United States, two in Australia, and one in Egypt. In addition to this, on December 13, 2006 there was a charity dinner and auction, where items participants were able to bid on included a gaming day for four in the Penny Arcade office, an appearance in a Penny Arcade strip, a tour of Bungie and recording session for the voice of a character in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, and a two-year subscription to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and the Burning Crusade special edition signed by all the developers. The year 2006 also became the first time that the 1 million dollar mark was reached.

In 2007, the charity added a hospital each in Hawaii and New Zealand.

During the 2008 Penny Arcade Expo, Harmonix announced that three songs from the Expo will be made available for download for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; video game. The proceeds of these three songs will go to the charity.

On November 13, 2009, Mike Krahulik announced that after one week, the Child&#x27;s Play 2009 total had already reached $455,863.80.

In 2010, Epic Games held a vote-by-purchase event between July 29 and September 6 to determine the fate of a character, Clayton Carmine, in their upcoming game &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;. Gamers voted by purchasing Xbox avatar T-shirts through Xbox live, or real life T-shirts at San Diego Comic-Con, with all purchases counting towards the vote. The voting campaign raised over $150,000, all of which was donated to Child&#x27;s Play.

In 2011, Mike Krahulik announced the first annual Child&#x27;s Play Invitational Golf Tournament to be held at the Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, California on June 5, 2011. All proceeds from the event go to the partner hospitals &amp; facilities in the Child&#x27;s Play network. The Golf Tournament was subsequently held at Angeles National Golf Course in Sunland, California, on June 8, 2012, and Inglewood Golf Club in Kenmore, Washington, on May 20, 2013.

In November 2013, Program Coordinator Jamie Dillion announced the first ever expansion of Child&#x27;s Play to benefit children in domestic violence facilities. The program was announced as a pilot and is scheduled to expand to open applications in Spring 2014. The shelter program will provide a pre-built game cart with game system, television, and games and will serve emergency shelters, long term shelters, advocacy centers and more.

In 2016, the charity raised over $160k at their Annual Dinner Auction, provided nearly 30 grants to libraries, shelters, schools, trauma centers, transitional housing, day programs and more to help them purchase games and systems. Also helped supply VR setups to hospitals for therapy and distraction along with iPads to special education classrooms and inpatient psychiatric units.

<doc id="1083815" wikidata="Q3558982" url="?curid=1083815" title="Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization">
<text>The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization is a document signed in 2004 by a number of non-profit organizations, scientists, academics and other individuals urging the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to focus on the needs of developing countries with respect to intellectual property legislation.

The authors and signatories believe that the &quot;world is facing a crisis in the governance of knowledge, technology, and culture&quot;, in particular due to unequal access to vital medicines and education, anticompetitive economic practices, concentration of ownership, technological measures such as digital rights management (DRM), the fair compensation of authors and creators, and the locking up of the public domain by private interests.

The Declaration criticises WIPO for embracing &quot;a culture of creating and expanding monopoly privileges, often without regard to consequences&quot;, and calls for the organization to shift its focus from intellectual property as an end in and of itself, to a means for benefiting humanity. In particular, it calls for a moratorium on the now-common practice of harmonizing intellectual property legislation throughout the developing world to the laws as they exist in the United States and Europe.

In 2009 this resulted into the WIPO Development Agenda, which incorporated some of the proposals.

<doc id="1083817" wikidata="Q2017456" url="?curid=1083817" title="San Diego Sockers (1978–1996)">
<text>The San Diego Sockers were a professional soccer and indoor soccer team based in San Diego, California. The team played in the indoor and outdoor editions of the North American Soccer League (NASL) until 1984 as well as the original Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) and the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). The franchise folded in 1996 and was the last surviving NASL franchise.

The Sockers are considered the most successful indoor soccer team. They made the playoffs in all but one of their 16 seasons of playing indoors.

==History==
The team began as the Baltimore Comets in 1974 but moved to San Diego as the San Diego Jaws in 1976. After a one-year stay in Las Vegas as the Las Vegas Quicksilvers, the team returned as the San Diego Sockers in 1978. They were owned by Bob Bell and played their indoor games at the San Diego Sports Arena.

Initially, victories came slowly for the club but mounted quickly and they experienced moderate success over their outdoor history winning several division titles. However, the San Diego Sockers won the North American Soccer League (NASL) Indoor Championships of 1981–82 and 1983–84.
Success was far from over for the San Diego Sockers. When the NASL folded, the San Diego Sockers moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League and won eight championships: 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. The Sockers carried their success from one league to the next. They switched to the Continental Indoor Soccer League for three more years from 1993 to 1995. However, after several ownership changes, Sockers folded after the 1996 season.

There have been two subsequent revivals of the Sockers. The first was a franchise in the WISL that later joined the second MISL before folding in 2004. A second started play in the PASL-PRO in 2009.

<doc id="1083821" wikidata="Q1093154" url="?curid=1083821" title="Eight Is Enough">
<text>Eight Is Enough is an American comedy-drama/sitcom television series that aired on ABC from March 15, 1977, to May 23, 1981. The show was modeled on the life of syndicated newspaper columnist Tom Braden, a real-life parent with eight children, who wrote a book by the same title.

==Synopsis==
The show centers on a Sacramento, California, family with eight children (from oldest to youngest: David, Mary, Joanie, Susan, Nancy, Elizabeth, Tommy, and Nicholas). The father, Tom Bradford (based on Tom Braden, played by Dick Van Patten), is a newspaper columnist for the fictional &quot;Sacramento Register&quot;. His wife Joan, based on Joan Braden, was a homemaker and took care of the children.

Joan was played by actress Diana Hyland (born Diane Gentner) and in early 1977, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. While undergoing a mastectomy, doctors discovered her cancer had metastasized. During filming her health suddenly deteriorated, and Hyland died on March 27, 1977, having filmed only four episodes. As a result, her character&#x27;s death was written into the second season of the series.

The second season begins in the fall of 1977 with Tom as a widower. He eventually meets and falls in love with Sandra Sue &quot;Abby&quot; Abbott (Betty Buckley), a widowed schoolteacher who comes to the house to tutor Tommy after he breaks his leg in a football game. Abby and Tom marry in one of the series&#x27; TV movie broadcasts on November 9, 1977. The role went to Buckley after being approved by network chief Brandon Tartikoff, who felt that the character of Miss Collins, the sympathetic high school gym teacher she had played in the 1976 film &quot;Carrie&quot;, would translate seamlessly to the series.

In the fourth season, in another of the series&#x27; TV movie broadcasts in September 1979, both David and Susan get married in a double wedding. As the series progresses, Abby receives her Ph.D. in education and starts a job counseling students at the local high school; oldest son David starts his own construction company; second-eldest daughter Joanie works as a TV producer; eldest daughter Mary becomes a medical doctor; third daughter Susan marries a baseball player, Merle &quot;The Pearl&quot; Stockwell, and has a baby; second-youngest son Tommy becomes a musician in a rock-and-roll band.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
*Dick Van Patten as Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bradford Sr.
*Diana Hyland as Joan Wells Bradford (season 1)

In the pilot, the role of David was played by Mark Hamill, Nancy was played by Kimberly Beck, and Tommy was played by Chris English. When ABC screened the pilot, they were unhappy with the performances of Beck and English, who were let go and replaced by Dianne Kay and Willie Aames. Hamill sought to get out of his five-year contract on &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; to take the opportunity to star as Luke Skywalker in George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;; Lorimar Productions granted his request and the role was re-cast with Grant Goodeve.

==Production==
The show was developed by writer William Blinn and was a Lorimar Production. It was originally distributed by Worldvision Enterprises. For the first three years the show filmed interior scenes at The Burbank Studios now known as the Warner Bros. Ranch. From the fourth season the show filmed interiors at MGM Studios in Culver City.

The home featured in the exterior shots was on Chiquita St, near Lankershim Boulevard in Los Angeles. The house has since been demolished and replaced. The interiors for seasons one through three were filmed on Soundstage 9 The Burbank Studio. Seasons four and five were shot on two stages at MGM in Culver City.

The show&#x27;s team of producers included Robert L. Jacks, Gary Adelson, Greg Strangis, and Phil Fehrle. Executive producers were Lee Rich and Philip Capice.

As a production of the Lorimar stable, who were concurrently producing CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Waltons&quot;, writers were often contracted by the producers and were shared between both programs. (&quot;Waltons&quot; co-star Will Geer also made an &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; guest appearance during season 2.) Regular writers included Peter Lefcourt, the writing teams of Gwen Bagni and Paul Dubov, Rod Peterson and Claire Whittaker, Bill Nuss and Dusty Kay (brother of &quot;Nancy Bradford&quot; Dianne Kay), Nick Thiel and David Braff, J. Miyoko Hensley and Steven Hensley, Bruce Shelly, Sandra Kay Siegel, Gil Grant, Karen I. Hall, and Hindi Brooks, who soon became the show&#x27;s long-time story editor. In-house directors included Philip Leacock, Harry Harris, and Irving J. Moore. As an in-joke, the character name of one of Nicholas Bradford&#x27;s best friends was Irving Julius Moore, a nod to the director of the same name whose middle name was, in fact, Joseph.

==Music==

===Theme===
For the show&#x27;s first two seasons, an upbeat instrumental piece written by Fred Werner was used as the show&#x27;s opening theme. Beginning with the show&#x27;s third season, this was replaced by a slowed-down vocal theme titled &quot;Eight Is Enough,&quot; which was sung by series co-star Grant Goodeve. The song had music by Lee Holdridge and lyrics by Molly-Ann Leikin, and was first heard in a longer arrangement on the last episode of the second season titled &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;, which was also performed by Goodeve.

==Score==
Early episodes had instrumental music by Fred Werner and Alexander Courage, but the show&#x27;s real musical stamp came from composer Earle Hagen, who had a knack of composing memorable cues as he had previously been the in-house composer on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. He composed a love theme for Tom and Abby, a theme that permeated the show in various incarnations throughout the remainder of the series. Some later episodes were scored by John Beal and Miles Goodman.

Back-to-back industry strikes in the show&#x27;s last seasons affected the show&#x27;s score, with both the 1980 SAG actors&#x27; strike and 1981 writers&#x27; strike forcing cost-cutting measures. Some of the later episodes were tracked with a combination of uncredited library music and original music by Hagen, Beal, and Goodman.

==Reception and cancellation==
The series jump-started acting careers for several of its young stars. It cemented teen idol status for Grant Goodeve (David), Willie Aames (Tommy), and Ralph Macchio, who played Abby&#x27;s orphaned nephew Jeremy later in the show&#x27;s last season. Aames went on to star with Scott Baio in &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;. Goodeve started a minor singing career, following his rendition of the show&#x27;s theme song (see Theme section) and initially hosted HGTV&#x27;s &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot;. Macchio gained the most fame in feature films, such as &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and its sequels as well as &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;.

After the end of the show&#x27;s fifth season (112 one-hour episodes), production costs and declining ratings caused the show to be cancelled with seven other shows that season (including &quot;The Waltons&quot;). &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s headline on the cancellation stated &quot;Eight Shows In, Eight Shows Out&quot;. In a 2000 episode of &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, Dick Van Patten stated that no one contacted him to inform him of the cancellation. Instead, he read about it in a newspaper.

The series had two reunion movies on NBC. In &quot;Eight Is Enough: A Family Reunion&quot; on October 18, 1987, Mary Frann replaced Betty Buckley as Abby; Buckley had been filming &quot;Frantic&quot; during its production. Then came &quot;An Eight Is Enough Wedding&quot; on October 15, 1989, this time with Sandy Faison as Abby. Both movies aired opposite Game 2 of the World Series on ABC.

==Nielsen Ratings==

*1977–1978 — #12
*1978–1979 — #11
*1979–1980 — #12

==Syndication==
Reruns of all 112 episodes of &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; have aired sporadically since the show&#x27;s syndication debut in September 1982. The show aired on FX from 1994 to 1997, on PAX in 1998, and as part of a marathon celebrating the 50th anniversary of Warner Bros. Television on TV Land in 2005. &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; also aired on the Chicago-based MeTV and MeToo, a sister station of MeTV, from 2008 to 2010 before MeTV spread to other markets around the U.S.

During its network run, the show was distributed by Worldvision Enterprises (also internationally in rebroadcasts), and later by Lorimar-Telepictures. All syndication rights are now held by Lorimar&#x27;s successor, Warner Bros. Television.

From 2006 until 2009, the series was formerly available for streaming online on AOL&#x27;s In2TV service.

The series is also available for purchase online on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.

Beginning in 2023, the series is available for streaming online on Tubi via the WBTV All Together Now FAST channel.

As of 2024, the complete series is also available on The Roku Channel, a free service and includes limited commercials.

===International===
In Italy, RAI public networks aired the first season of &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; under the title &quot;Otto Bastano&quot; in 1978, the literal Italian translation of the original title. The remaining seasons were aired in the 1980s on Retequattro, a commercial network from Fininvest (now Mediaset), under the title &quot;La Famiglia Bradford&quot;. The Italian version excludes the laugh track.

The French version, &quot;Huit, ça suffit!&quot;, which excludes the laugh track, was successful in the 1980s in France and Quebec, and with the francophone Canadian audience in general.

In Spain during the same period, &quot;Con Ocho Basta&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;) ran on &#x27;s Friday night line-up.

In the Philippines, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot; aired on GMA Radio-Television Arts from 1978 to 1981.

<text>Mary Anne Veronica Chambers, (born September 8, 1950) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada, and was named Chancellor of the University of Guelph in September 2022. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 until 2007, and served in the cabinet in the government of Premier Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Chambers was born in Jamaica, and emigrated to Canada in 1976. She is a graduate of The Immaculate Conception High School. She was a banker prior to entering political life. She joined Scotiabank in 1976, and was involved in the expansion of computer and electronic services within the organisation. She was also involved in a number of task forces concerning the role of women in the workplace. In 1988, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto with a major in Commerce.

Chambers was named a Senior Vice-President of the bank in 1998, retiring from the position in December 2002. She is also a former director of &quot;Grace, Kennedy (Ontario) Ltd.&quot; and &quot;Grace Foods International Ltd.&quot;, prominent food distribution companies belonging to a parent organization in Jamaica.

Chambers was a member of the Rouge Valley Health System, serving as Vice-Chair for a time. She was a member of the Board of Governors at the University of Toronto from 1993 to 2001, and Vice-Chair of the Governing Council from 1998 to 2001. She helped to author a University policy that no student would be prevented from studying at Toronto for inadequate financial resources.

Chambers was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the United Way of Greater Toronto from 1994 to 2001, and was President of the Canadian Club of Toronto from 1998 to 1999. In 2003, she was awarded the Jamaican Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation for Service to Jamaica by Jamaican Prime Minister Percival James Patterson, in recognition of her work within Toronto&#x27;s Jamaican community.

==Politics==
Chambers was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the provincial election of 2003, as a Liberal in the riding of Scarborough East, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Steve Gilchrist by over 7000 votes. The Liberals won the provincial election, and Chambers was appointed Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities on October 23, 2003. In early 2004, she reaffirmed her government&#x27;s election pledge not to raise tuition rates.

Chambers was appointed Ontario Minister of Children and Youth Services in June 2005. On July 11, 2007, she announced that she would not be running for re-election to the Ontario Legislature. In 2015, she was made a member of the Order of Ontario. On May 17, 2015, she spoke in support of the nomination of NDP candidate Adaoma Patterson for Brampton West.

<text>Digby Augustus Stewart Mackworth Dolben (8 February 1848 – 28 June 1867) was an English poet who died young from drowning. He owes his poetic reputation to his cousin, Robert Bridges, poet laureate from 1913 to 1930, who edited a partial edition of his verse, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 1911.

He was born in Guernsey, and brought up at Finedon Hall in Northamptonshire. His father, William Harcourt Isham Mackworth (1806—1872), a younger son of Sir Digby Mackworth, the 3rd Baronet, took the additional surname Dolben after he married Frances, the heiress of Sir John English Dolben, the 4th Baronet.

He was educated at Cheam School and Eton College, studying under the influential Master William Johnson Cory whose principles of pedagogy and collection of verses &quot;Ionica&quot; inspired his own poetry. At Eton, his distant cousin Bridges was his senior and took him under his wing.

Dolben caused considerable scandal at school by his behaviour. He marked his romantic attachment to another pupil a year older than he was, Martin Le Marchant Gosselin, by writing love poetry. He also defied his strict Protestant upbringing by joining a High Church Puseyite group of pupils. He then claimed allegiance to the Order of St Benedict, affecting a monk&#x27;s habit. He was considering a conversion to Roman Catholicism.

In 1865 on his seventeenth birthday, he was introduced by Bridges, by then an undergraduate at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to Gerard Manley Hopkins who was at Balliol. According to the account given by his biographer Norman White, this encounter greatly perturbed Hopkins.

Hopkins&#x27;s biographer Robert Bernard Martin asserts that Hopkins&#x27;s meeting with Dolben, &quot;was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life&quot;.
Hopkins kept up a correspondence with Dolben, wrote about him in his diary and composed two poems about the youth, &quot;Where art thou friend&quot; and &quot;The Beginning of the End.&quot; Hopkins&#x27; High Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Dolben&#x27;s death greatly affected Hopkins, although his feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled by that time.

Dolben drowned in the River Welland when bathing with the ten-year-old son of his tutor, Rev. C. E. Prichard, Rector of South Luffenham in Rutland. Dolben was then aged 19 and preparing to go up to Oxford.

Bridges guaranteed Dolben&#x27;s reputation with &quot;Three Friends: Memoirs of Digby Mackworth Dolben, Richard Watson Dixon, Henry Bradley&quot; (1932), as well as the careful editing of his poetry. Subsequently, &quot;The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848–1867&quot; (1981) has given a less selective picture.

Hopkins&#x27; infatuation for Dolben and Dolben&#x27;s tragic death feature in Simon Edge&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hopkins Conundrum&quot; (2017).

<doc id="1083841" wikidata="Q998220" url="?curid=1083841" title="Black Panther (character)">
<text>Black Panther is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #52, published in July 1966. On Earth-616, Black Panther&#x27;s birth name is T&#x27;Challa, and he is the son of the previous Black Panther, T&#x27;Chaka. He is the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced society drawing from a supply of vibranium, a fictional metal of extraordinary properties. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T&#x27;Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, expertise in his nation&#x27;s traditions, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies. The character became a member of the Avengers in 1968, and has continued that affiliation off and on in subsequent decades.

The storylines of the 1970s written by Don McGregor were critically acclaimed and introduced T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s nemesis Erik Killmonger. These stories also engage with significant social issues of the time, such as the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S. state of Georgia. A subsequent story addressed the issue of apartheid in South Africa. However, Black Panther was a somewhat neglected character of low popularity until his reinvention by Christopher Priest in the late 1990s. Priest re-emphasized the importance of Wakanda as an independent and technologically advanced African nation. Priest also introduced the Dora Milaje, Black Panther&#x27;s female bodyguards. In subsequent series written by Reginald Hudlin, T&#x27;Challa married Storm of the X-Men. Hudlin&#x27;s stories emphasize Black cultural pride and achieved greater commercial success. In Hudlin&#x27;s era, the role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also temporarily given to T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s sister Shuri while he was briefly in a coma. While T&#x27;Challa and Storm&#x27;s marriage was annulled in a subsequent storyline, their relationship has continued in other narratives. The Black Panther comics became particularly commercially successful in 2016, partly as a result of the literary fame of their writer, the journalist and essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates. The first issue of his series was the best-selling comic book of that month. Coates&#x27;s series call into question the legitimacy of monarchy in Wakanda and articulate a more democratic vision.

Black Panther is the first Black superhero in American mainstream comics. The character is also an early example of the Afrofuturist aesthetic. He has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films, and video games. Chadwick Boseman portrayed T&#x27;Challa in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s films: &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). He also voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021), which was released after his death. The &quot;Black Panther&quot; film was a notable critical and popular success. Letitia Wright&#x27;s character Shuri, who had appeared in previous MCU films, took on the Black Panther mantle in &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022), following Boseman&#x27;s death in 2020.

==Publication history==
===Creation===

The origin of the character has been disputed by both Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, with both claiming the impetus for the idea. However, both of the creators have said they were motivated by general humanistic and inclusive values, rather than any social or political awareness of the civil rights movement.

Kirby claimed sole credit for creating the character in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #134 (February 1990), stating that he realized an absence of Black characters in his comics, and believed that they should be added for &quot;human reasons&quot;.

In another interview, Kirby declared: &quot;I came up with the Black Panther because I realized I had no blacks in my strip. I&#x27;d never drawn a black. I needed a black. I suddenly discovered that I had a lot of black readers. My first friend was a black! And here I was ignoring them because I was associating with everybody else.&quot;

Lee, in contrast, claimed he created the character because, in the mid-1960s, he wanted to include more African and African American characters in Marvel Comics. Lee later recollected: &quot;I suddenly realized that there were no black superheroes, and I felt we ought to have one. There were no black heroes that I knew about, and there were certainly no black heroes who were the king of their own country in Africa. [...] He didn&#x27;t live in a village with thatched huts--although that&#x27;s what you saw on the surface. Underneath was that fantastic city that he had created, which was completely scientific and had all the latest equipment of every type in it. And we realize that the Black Panther is one of the world&#x27;s great scientists--[just like] Reed Richards. So, again, I wanted to go against [stereotypes].&quot;

While there is no documentation to establish the veracity of either claim to originality, by 1966 Kirby is thought to have been largely plotting the book on his own and explaining the stories to Lee when the pages arrived in the Marvel offices. In a 1968 interview, Lee said:

Roy Thomas has made claims that support Lee&#x27;s version of events, while Kirby is supported by his wife and prior artwork. In 1963, Lee and Kirby included a black character, Gabe Jones, in the ensemble cast of &quot;Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos&quot;, and Lee encouraged artists to include black characters in crowd scenes. In a 1998 interview, Lee explained his motivation: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t thinking of civil rights. I had a lot of friends who were black, and we had artists who were black. So, it occurred to me... why aren&#x27;t there any black heroes?&quot; Soon after Black Panther was introduced, Marvel added two more recurring black characters: Jill Jerrold in &quot;Modeling with Millie&quot;, and Bill Foster in &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

Co-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who had a black panther as a helper. Jack Kirby&#x27;s original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name Coal Tiger; this was a swashbuckler. Lee asked for the concept art to be revised.

There was some debate at Marvel, with Lee wondering how far to go with the introduction of a Black superhero, which was commercially risky in that era. In the first version of the cover for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #52, Kirby drew the Black Panther wearing a cowl that exposed his face. In the published version, the cowl became a full facemask. Previews in other comics did not show the cover at all, indicating that Lee was hesitant.

Black Panther first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #52, published in July 1966, and the following issue in August of the same year.

===Predecessors===
The Black Panther is the first Black superhero in American mainstream comic books. Very few Black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included Lothar in the comic strip Mandrake the Magician and the characters in the single-issue &quot;All-Negro Comics&quot; #1 (1947). Marvel&#x27;s 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics also introduced Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title &quot;Jungle Tales&quot;. and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first Black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured Black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;.

Influences on the character included historical figures such as 14th-century Mali Empire sultan Mansa Musa and 20th-century Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey, as well as Biblical figures such as Ham and Canaan. Other scholars have identified other precursors: Harry Wills, a champion boxer of the early 20th century nicknamed the Black Panther, and a predominately African-American armored combat unit in World War II also called the Black Panthers, the 761st Tank Battalion of the US Army. Lee and Kirby also borrow from typical pop cultural tropes of their era inspired by Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s Tarzan, but subvert or transform stereotypes common in the &quot;jungle adventure&quot; genre.

The name Black Panther predates the founding of the Black Panther Party in October 1966, though not the black panther logo of the party&#x27;s predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO). Scripter Stan Lee denied that the comic, which pre-dates the political usage of the term, was, or could have been, named after any of the political uses of the term &quot;black panther&quot;, including the LCFO, citing &quot;a strange coincidence&quot;.

In a guest appearance in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #119 (February 1972), the Black Panther briefly used the name &quot;Black Leopard&quot; to avoid connotations with the Party, but the new name did not last. The character&#x27;s name was changed back to Black Panther in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #105, with T&#x27;Challa explaining that renaming himself made as much sense as altering the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s name, and he is not a stereotype. &quot;Avengers&quot; writer Roy Thomas said that the Black Panther name &quot;had more resonance,&quot; but that the political implications limited the character&#x27;s prominence.

===Early years: 1960s and early 1970s===
Subsequent to his first appearance, Black Panther made guest appearances in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #97–99 and &quot;Captain America&quot; 100 (January – April 1968). The Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City to join the titular American superhero team in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #52 (May 1968). He appeared in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he also made solo guest-appearances in three issues of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and fought Doctor Doom in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #6–7 (June &amp; August 1971), in that supervillain&#x27;s starring feature.

===1970s and 1980s===
He received his first starring feature with &quot;Jungle Action&quot; #5 (July 1973), a reprint of a story in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #62 (March 1969) that focused on Black Panther. A new series, titled &quot;Panther&#x27;s Rage,&quot; began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed series ran in &quot;Jungle Action&quot; #6–18 (1973-1975).

One now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first graphic novel&quot;:

&quot;Panther&#x27;s Rage&quot; also introduces T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s nemesis Erik Killmonger, a rival for the throne of Wakanda who recurs in subsequent series. Rebecca Wanzo, a scholar of African-American literature, describes &quot;Panther&#x27;s Rage&quot; as &quot;the first major step in decolonizing the character.&quot; The cast of the story arc is almost entirely Black.

The second and final arc in &quot;Jungle Action&quot;, also written by McGregor, was titled &quot;Panther vs. the Klan&quot; and ran in 1976. The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team. Scholars Burton P. Buchanan, Ivan Alcime, and Carlos D. Morrison point out that the story was published at a time of resurgence for the Klan in Georgia, and that the story prescribes a self-defense strategy for Black people in response.

African-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the &quot;Jungle Action&quot; &quot;Black Panther&quot; feature:

Qiana J. Witted points out that the artists in this period incorporated African American popular culture of the era, such as T&#x27;Challa wearing a &quot;modified version of the gold-chain outfit worn by singer Isaac Hayes for the Watts, Los Angeles, community benefit concert that was released as the 1973 documentary film &quot;Wattstax&quot;.&quot;

Though popular with college students, the overall sales of &quot;Jungle Action&quot; were low. Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character&#x27;s co-creator Jack Kirby—newly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a time—as writer, penciler, and editor. In the series, Black Panther searches for a magic artifact called King Solomon&#x27;s Frog. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively. He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). &quot;Black Panther&quot; ran 15 issues (January 1977 – May 1979). Because the series was discontinued, the contents of what would have been &quot;Black Panther&quot; #16–18 were published in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #51–53.

In 1980, Black Panther appeared as a guest star in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #84-86, written by Ed Hannigan. This story introduced Black Panther&#x27;s rivalry with Namor and his kingdom of Atlantis, which becomes a recurring conflict in future story lines. Later in the year, Black Panther appeared in a back up story in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #100 that establishes his relationship with Storm of the X-Men.

A four-issue miniseries, &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 2, (July – October 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan. McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in &quot;Panther&#x27;s Quest&quot;, published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; (issues #13–37, Feb.–December 1989). The story takes place in South Africa. In the view of critic Todd Steven Burroughs, &quot;&#x27;Quest&#x27; attempts to show how oppressive apartheid is for everyone involved.&quot;

===1990s===
McGregor later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries &quot;Black Panther: Panther&#x27;s Prey&quot; (September 1990 – March 1991).

Writer Christopher Priest&#x27;s and penciller Mark Texeira&#x27;s 1998 series &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 3 re-invented the character. Scholar Todd Steven Burroughs describes the new vision for the Black Panther as &quot;a combination of Frank Miller&#x27;s Batman and South African president Nelson Mandela.&quot; Priest was the first Black creator to become an editor at Marvel. Inspired by the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Coming to America&quot;, Priest and his artists returned to the fundamental sovereignty of Wakanda. He revisited Erik Killmonger and other characters introduced in &quot;Panther&#x27;s Rage&quot;, together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross and the Dora Milaje, the Panther&#x27;s female bodyguards. In their original characterization, the Dora Milaje are beautiful teenage girls who are, officially speaking, the Panther&#x27;s potential wives. Dora Milaje is said to translate from Hausa to &quot;adored ones.&quot; Priest made the Panther god another form of the Egyptian goddess Bastet, originally depicted as a black cat.

The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest&#x27;s initial concept was inspired by Batman but also one of Batman&#x27;s nemeses, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, the mysterious leader of a League of Assassins. Priest believed this &quot;fearsome African warrior&quot; would simply be too intimidating for the Marvel universe. Priest says the device of Ross&#x27;s character contributed greatly to his ability to write the series: &quot;I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to.&quot; He added his opinion that the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his initial creation by Lee and Kirby. Priest believed Black Panther was generally considered a dull &quot;also-ran&quot; with no evident powers.

To reinvent the character, he emphasized Black Panther&#x27;s role as a monarch of a technologically advanced independent nation, and hence one of the most powerful figures in the Marvel universe. Influenced by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, he aimed to introduce moral ambiguity and political complexity to the world of Black Panther. Priest also envisioned the series as a political satire, comparing it to &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In Priest&#x27;s characterization, T&#x27;Challa actually joined the Avengers in order to spy on them, protecting Wakanda&#x27;s national interests. Ta-Nehisi Coates has said that Priest &quot;had &quot;the&quot; classic run on Black Panther, period, and that&#x27;s gonna be true for a long time.&quot;

Jim Dandeneau of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also states that Priest&#x27;s is &quot;probably the definitive run of Black Panther. This is where Wakanda stopped being backstory and started being a living, breathing place, with geography and politics and history that all contributed to its depth and beauty. It&#x27;s also where a bunch of what&#x27;s going on the screen started: Priest introduced Everett K. Ross and the Dora Milaje almost immediately in his first issue. Priest had been separated from Marvel for several years before coming back to write this book under a separate, independent line within Marvel as the rest of the company went bankrupt around it. So, he was given a lot of leeway to write the story he wanted to, and what came out was one of the greatest runs on any comic ever.&quot;

Cultural critic Douglas Wolk agrees that Christopher Priest&#x27;s run established the canonical version of the character, although: &quot;The tone of Priest&#x27;s run was wildly different from any other Black Panther stories before or since--it&#x27;s basically a political comedy--but Priest&#x27;s central insight was that T&#x27;Challa isn&#x27;t actually a superhero in the ordinary sense,&quot; but rather a monarch. He also says that the first issue of the run makes no sense at first reading, and requires a continuing interpretation of future issues. He argues that this is unique in mainstream superhero comics.

===2000s===
&quot;Black Panther&quot; #25-27 (December 2000-February 2001) reintroduce Storm as a major character in Black Panther&#x27;s world. Priest intended their love affair as a consistent aspect of their youthful development, but did not believe they could form a durable relationship.

The last 13 issues of Priest&#x27;s series (#50–62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T&#x27;Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series &quot;The Crew&quot;, running concurrently with the final few &quot;Black Panther&quot; issues. &quot;The Crew&quot; was canceled with issue #7.
In 2005, Marvel began publishing &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 4, which ran 41 issues (April 2005 – November 2008). It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin is a Hollywood writer and director who was at that time the president of the entertainment division of Black Entertainment Television. He wanted to add &quot;street cred&quot; to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership. As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs. The Black Panther comics that Hudlin wrote sold much better than any previous series featuring the character, including Priest&#x27;s. According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2005) #1 was the 27th best-selling comic book in February 2005. Hudlin&#x27;s series also received positive notice from figures outside the comic book world, such as Ice Cube and Ziggy Marley.

In 2006, during Hudlin&#x27;s run, T&#x27;Challa marries Storm of the X-Men, and she appeared as a prominent supporting character in many subsequent storylines. Readers and critics compared the wedding to the relationship of Jay-Z and Beyoncé, although they did not marry until two years later. This wedding takes place during Marvel&#x27;s Civil War event, and presented a temporary truce in the conflict of that storyline. Subsequently, as a result of the conflict among superheroes during this era, the two characters replace Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman in the Fantastic Four. Douglas Wolk observes that the wedding is the most well-known moment in Hudlin&#x27;s run, and contends that the &quot;mutual admiration leading to matrimony seemed to come out of nowhere,&quot; that neither have much in common &quot;besides being superheroes with somewhat formal speech patterns and connections to Africa and divinity,&quot; and that while &quot;one is a champion of a cross-sectional group, the other is a monarch of a physical nation.&quot; Hudlin responded to such criticisms in a 2010 interview, declaring that the wedding was set up for months by two different storylines and that the two characters are perfectly matched.

In Hudlin&#x27;s series, the Dora Milaje are a clearly military organization, with shaven heads, rather than the attractive teenage girls previously established by Priest. In addition, Hudlin established T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s complex friendship with Luke Cage, another prominent Black superhero created several years after Black Panther. While T&#x27;Challa is from an African nation that was never colonized, Cage is a street-level New York superhero of a vastly different culture. Hudlin explores these differences in the interactions between the two heroes. Like Priest, Hudlin emphasizes Black Panther&#x27;s power and independence; as he puts it, T&#x27;Challa is &quot;an INTERNATIONAL player who&#x27;s equally at home at the Davos Conference in Switzerland, meeting with Colin Powell in D.C., kicking it in Harlem with Bill Clinton and Al Sharpton, and brokering deals off the coast of Cuba with Fidel Castro and Prince Namor.&quot;

In 2008, Jason Aaron concluded the fourth volume of &quot;Black Panther&quot; with a war story about battling a Skrull invasion of Wakanda, tying in with Marvel&#x27;s Secret Invasion event. &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 5 launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s sister Shuri.

Tyler Huckabee of &quot;IGN&quot; included Hudlin&#x27;s &quot;Black Panther&quot; comic book series in their &quot;10 Best Black Panther Comic Books&quot; list, stating, &quot;Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s run is more traditionally superhero-esque in nature than many other titles on this list, featuring costumed villains and super guest stars like the X-Men and Namor. It also introduces a number of characters who&#x27;ve become key players in the Black Panther&#x27;s life (like his sister Shuri) and tells what has now become the definitive origin story.&quot;

Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer, joined by artist Will Conrad.

===2010s===
Both T&#x27;Challa and Shuri fight Doctor Doom, alongside members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Doomwar&quot; (April – September 2010). &quot;Doomwar&quot; introduces the Midnight Angels, an armored division of the Dora Milaje. In this period, T&#x27;Challa has given up his powers and has been replaced by his sister. At the conclusion of the story, Doom steals Wakanda&#x27;s supply of vibranium, and T&#x27;Challa destroys all of it in response.

T&#x27;Challa then accepts an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood. Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he became the lead character in &quot;Daredevil&quot; beginning with issue #513 (February 2011); the series was retitled &quot;Black Panther: The Man Without Fear&quot;. He takes on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner to be close to the people. He fights street crime and various enemies of Daredevil, in this case relying on his own athletic ability and without the traditional Black Panther powers and Wakandan technology. He also confronts a new version of the Hate-Monger, a Silver Age emblem of bigotry who represents contemporary racist and anti-immigrant ideology. In Fantastic Four #608, written by Jonathan Hickman, T&#x27;Challa again meets the Panther god Bast. Bast reveals that catastrophe will come to Wakanda and that T&#x27;Challa will need to be reborn as a new Black Panther. His restored powers exceed his previous strength, and he is also given the collective memories of all the previous Black Panthers. Black Panther then takes part in the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; event. As a result of this conflict, his marriage to Storm is annulled.

For three years, beginning in 2013, Black Panther did not have in his own solo title but instead appeared as one of the primary members of &quot;New Avengers&quot;, written by Jonathan Hickman. Hickman later recalled that this was a conscious cross-media marketing plan to lead toward a relaunch of &quot;Black Panther&quot; coinciding with the feature film. In this series, Black Panther works together with a secret team of the most powerful heroes, the Illuminati. He often finds himself torn between the needs of his particular nation and more global concerns. In particular, he has a mortal conflict with Namor, who is responsible for a bloody invasion of Wakanda. Black Panther then joins &quot;The Ultimates&quot;, written by Al Ewing. The group battles Galactus.
A new &quot;Black Panther&quot; series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016. Marvel intended the series to respond to contemporary social justice concerns. Coates was previously a correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and won the National Book Award for his essay &quot;Between the World and Me&quot;. As Todd Steven Burroughs writes, &quot;The announcement that Ta-Nehisi Coates––the writer whom Toni Morrison called the heir to novelist and essayist James Baldwin––was going to write a new, ongoing &quot;Black Panther&quot; title shook both the Marvel Universe and café society.&quot; In Coates&#x27;s first storyline, titled &quot;A Nation Under Our Feet&quot;, T&#x27;Challa faces a popular uprising against his monarchy. At the conclusion of the story, Wakanda is reformed into a constitutional democracy, with the Black Panther continuing as a figurehead king rather than a ruler. This series introduces a new version of The Crew, now including Storm, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, and Manifold.

According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2016) #1 was the best-selling comic book in April 2016, while #2 was the 9th best-selling comic book in May 2016. The first issue received positive reviews from &quot;Comics Beat&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;. Critics found the second issue compelling and unusual, but enigmatic. Critic Todd Steven Burroughs characterizes the story as &quot;ultra-cerebral,&quot; and suggests that some of the previous authors of the character may have found it pretentious. He interprets the story as a fascinating deconstruction of Wakanda that removes &quot;what [Coates] might call the intellectual crutch of Black nationalism&quot; from the mythos of Black Panther.

In Coates&#x27; second storyline, &quot;Avengers of the New World&quot;, Wakanda&#x27;s mythology was expanded, showing the panther goddess Bast as a member of a pantheon known as The Orisha, the term orisha, a Yoruba word for spirit or deity from Yoruba mythology, the pantheon is composed of Egyptian gods and other origins, such as Kokou, an orisha from Benin. Coates also wrote a six-issue series called &quot;Black Panther and the Crew&quot; that addresses the problem of police killings and also suggests that the Marvel universe includes a number of previously unknown superheroes from the Bandung Conference. Coates also co-wrote a new series called &quot;Black Panther: World of Wakanda&quot; together with Roxane Gay that detailed more about the Dora Milaje.

In 2017, the Africanfuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote the series &quot;Black Panther: Long Live the King&quot;.

In February 2018, Christopher Priest, Don McGregor, and Reginald Hudlin each contributed one story to the &quot;Black Panther&quot; Annual #1.

In spring 2018, Coates wrote a new Black Panther series. Titled &quot;The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda&quot;, this is a space opera. According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018) #1 was the 5th best-selling comic book in May 2018.

Oliver Vestal of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018) #1 a score of 97%, writing, &quot;&quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 made for a strong start to the series. Ta-Nehisi Coates uses thorough world-building to establish a plot and characters. Daniel Acuña uses a mix of blurry and clear details and a dark palette to reflect the tone of the issue.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 a grade of 8.6 out of 10, asserting, &quot;&quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 is a promising start for this new era of Coates&#x27; run. It&#x27;s certainly different enough from previous incarnations. And Acuna&#x27;s art ensures that the book looks better than it has since Brian Stelfreeze was drawing it. Issue #1 gives readers a fresh start with the character while also offering plenty of incentive to stick around and see where this strange odyssey is heading.&quot;

===2020s===
In 2021, John Ridley wrote a new five-issue Black Panther series. According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2021) #1 was the 10th best-selling comic book in November 2021.

Hannibal Tabu of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; gave &quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 a grade of 8.5 out of 10, saying, &quot;This John Ridley script is a rush of adrenaline and smarts all at once, with clever elements introduced along the way. T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s secret balances both the old ways of Wakanda as personified by the White Wolf and the modern egalitarian Wakanda he&#x27;s trying to build. Then there&#x27;s the visual storytelling from Juann Cabal, Federico Blee, and Joe Sabino, which will tickle the fancy of fans of, well, any Marvel project featuring Sebastian Stan, basically. They feature a great Avengers fight scene (that also mixes in wonderful character work) with a gorgeous view of an evolving Wakanda. &quot;A king&#x27;s business is getting things done,&quot; T&#x27;Challa says at one point. With a great espionage-tinted take, this issue takes that business very seriously.&quot; Tim Adams of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, saying, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s new era of Black Panther gets off to a captivating start. Whereas the previous volume by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Daniel Acuna primarily took place in the stars, John Ridley, Juann Cabal, and Federico Blue deliver the beginnings of an espionage tale. Marvel Stormbreaker artist Juann Cabal is quickly rising as a superstar artist after fan-favorite runs on X-23 and Guardians of the Galaxy. His work with Blee on Black Panther remains top-notch, and watching T&#x27;Challa balance his responsibilities between being the chairperson of the Avengers and ruler of Wakanda is even stressful for the reader. The main plot reveals some major secrets Black Panther has been keeping, which has those closest to him questioning his actions in an understandable way. Something I always enjoy with a first issue is an end-of-page teaser offering clues to future storylines, and this one has some juicy scenes of stories-to-come.&quot;

In July 2022 the limited series &quot;Wakanda&quot; was announced, written by Stephanie Williams and illustrated by Paco Medina, the series will have a backup series titled &quot;History of the Black Panthers&quot;, written by Evan Narcisse and illustrated by Natacha Bustos. In August 2022, Marvel announced the one-shot &quot;Black Panther: Unconquered&quot;, written by Bryan Edward Hill and illustrated by Alberto Foche.

In January 2023, a new &quot;Black Panther&quot; series was announced, written by Eve Ewing and illustrated by Chris Allen.

According to the ComicHub system at local comic book shops selling American comics, &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2023) #1 was the 11th best-selling comic book in June 2023.

Hannah Rose of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 is a subtle and humane study of a changing character and shifting fictional landscape. Although a slow burn in turns of action, and offers questions with no easy answers, this issue is worth checking out precisely for those reasons.&quot; Charlie Ridgely of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Black Panther&quot; #1 a grade of 5 out of 5, stating, &quot;If a king has no kingdom, what does he become? That&#x27;s one of the central questions that writer Eve L. Ewing sets out to answer in her exciting new &quot;Black Panther&quot; series at Marvel Comics. This new take on the iconic character strips away so much of what we&#x27;ve always thought the Black Panther to be, focusing on who T&#x27;Challa is at his core. The result, at least in this week&#x27;s debut issue, is a fantastic exploration of a character readers have known for years, making him seem both brand new and entirely familiar.&quot;

Bryan Edward Hill writes &quot;Ultimate Black Panther&quot; with art by Stefano Caselli, which takes place in an alternate continuity from the mainstream Marvel universe. The comic is about Black Panther defending the continent of Africa from the deities Khonshu and Ra. Hill said &quot;I was invigorated by this opportunity because in addition to my immense respect for Jonathan Hickman&#x27;s detailed storytelling, the idea of shepherding this bold new take on Black Panther in this event gives me a platform to do the kind of broad, epic, storytelling I&#x27;ve always wanted to do in comics. My influences range from the history of Black Panther comics, to Ryan Coogler&#x27;s incredible work with the recent films, to Frank Herbert&#x27;s world-building capacity of &quot;Dune&quot;. This is something people won&#x27;t expect, in the best of ways, and full credit to Marvel and editors Wil Moss and Michelle Marchese for bringing this creative possibility to me.&quot;

==Characterization==
===Fictional character biography===
T&#x27;Challa is born in Wakanda to T&#x27;Chaka, the Black Panther, and Queen N&#x27;Yami. N&#x27;Yami dies in childbirth, and T&#x27;Chaka&#x27;s second wife, Ramonda, gives birth to Shuri. Ramonda vanishes shortly after. T&#x27;Challa defeats his uncle during a ritual event; this earns him the right to ingest a powerful ancestral heart-shaped herb. The herb gives him superhuman strength and speed, and he inherits the title of Black Panther. However, in T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s boyhood Klaw invades Wakanda and murders T&#x27;Chaka during an attempt to seize Wakanda&#x27;s valuable natural resource, vibranium. T&#x27;Challa and the Wakandans drive Klaw from the country and wound him. As an adolescent, T&#x27;Challa goes on a walkabout manhood ritual and meets a young orphan in Cairo, Ororo Munroe (who will later become known as Storm). He is sent abroad and graduates from Oxford University. He travels the world and returns to claim his throne in Wakanda.

Klaw returns to Wakanda to resume his attempt to steal the vibranium; this time, he is equipped with strange new weapons based on sound. T&#x27;Challa invites the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and attempts to neutralize them individually. He does this to test himself as preparation to battle Klaw. The Fantastic Four and T&#x27;Challa learn mutual respect for one another and team up to defeat Klaw together. T&#x27;Challa later leaves Wakanda and joins the Avengers, on Captain America&#x27;s recommendation. T&#x27;Challa later reveals that he joined the team in order to spy on them and determine their possible effects on Wakanda&#x27;s national interest. He lives in New York City and works as an inner-city school teacher under the secret identity &quot;Luke Charles.&quot; He meets and establishes a relationship Monica Lynn, a soul singer, who accompanies him on his return to Wakanda. However, upon his return, T&#x27;Challa finds that Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan who was exiled to the U.S. because his father assisted Klaw, is prepared to usurp his title. T&#x27;Challa eventually defeats Killmonger in a battle atop a waterfall. Along with Lynne, T&#x27;Challa then leaves Wakanda again to investigate the murder of Lynne&#x27;s sister. He determines that the Ku Klux Klan are to blame, and defeats them in combat as well. In later adventures, he reunites with his stepmother Ramonda and confronts apartheid in South Africa. He enters into conflict with a rival monarch, Namor of Atlantis. He also works together with a staffer of the United States Department of State, Everett K. Ross, and a team of female bodyguards called the Dora Milaje. He leaves Monica Lynn, re-connects with Storm, and deals with a renegade Dora Milaje named Nakia who feels jilted by him and seeks revenge. Erik Killmonger returns and destabilizes the economy of Wakanda in a renewed effort to conquer it. Killmonger defeats T&#x27;Challa and becomes a new Black Panther, but he is poisoned by the heart-shaped herb during his ascension ceremony. Killmonger is rendered comatose and T&#x27;Challa returns to his position.

Later, T&#x27;Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council and hides in New York City. While recovering, he trains a police officer, Kasper Cole, to be the new Black Panther. T&#x27;Challa eventually recovers, Cole becomes White Tiger, and T&#x27;Challa returns to Wakanda.

Klaw again attempts to invade Wakanda and to cause a war with Wakanda&#x27;s neighbor, Niganda. The U.S. government sends an army of Deathloks, cyborg warriors, to occupy Wakanda and fight Klaw. It becomes evident that Klaw&#x27;s invasion is actually a ruse to advance U.S. Imperialism. Klaw holds T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s mother hostage, but he refuses to negotiate. Black Panther and the Wakandans successfully defeat the Deathloks and Klaw.

T&#x27;Challa marries Storm. They tour the world. Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America against Iron Man in the civil war among superheroes sparked by the superhero registration initiative. They then temporarily join the Fantastic Four. Killmonger again tries to conquer Wakanda, but he is killed by Monica Rambeau. Storm and Black Panther then repel another invasion, from the alien Skrulls.

Storm returns to the X-Men and Black Panther returns to Wakanda. T&#x27;Challa suffers a brutal attack after meeting with Doctor Doom and Namor. His sister Shuri is trained as the next Black Panther. T&#x27;Challa is temporarily in a coma; the supervillain Morlun tries to devour his body. Shuri rescues her brother from Morlun, and is officially inaugurated as a new Black Panther while T&#x27;Challa recovers. T&#x27;Challa and Shuri team up to fight Doctor Doom, along with the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and Deadpool. T&#x27;Challa remains wounded, so he is mystically charged by a Wakandan healer. Now returned to power, T&#x27;Challa leads a Dora Milaje army. However, because Doom is on the verge of taking control of Wakanda&#x27;s vibranium, T&#x27;Challa takes the desperate measure of de-powering all of it. Now stripped of his power, T&#x27;Challa leaves Wakanda, while Shuri searches the world for new vibranium. Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T&#x27;Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, while Murdock takes a leave of absence. T&#x27;Challa takes on a new secret identity in New York, presenting himself as &quot;Mr. Okonkwo&quot;, an immigrant from Democratic Republic of the Congo and a manager of a restaurant. Simultaneously, he takes on Daredevil&#x27;s job as a crime-fighter.

Upon his return to Wakanda, T&#x27;Challa serves as a second to his sister, Shuri, who remains the kingdom&#x27;s active ruler. T&#x27;Challa calls on the Fantastic Four to help him with conflict with Necropolis, a tomb below Wakanda. T&#x27;Challa meets Bast, the Panther god, who shows him prophecies of future disasters and restores all of his Black Panther powers so that he will be able to face these challenges. He also gains all the collective memories of previous Black Panthers. Shortly after, the Avengers come into conflict with the X-Men. Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave. Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled because of her connection to her fellow mutant, Namor.

T&#x27;Challa calls on an elite and secret group of superheroes to face a new threat to the universe and all alternative universes. This group, the Illuminati, includes Mister Fantastic, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Black Bolt, Beast, and Namor. T&#x27;Challa has discovered incursions from parallel Earths that could lead to the destruction of universes. T&#x27;Challa must temporarily put his animosity toward Namor aside, though Black Panther vows to kill Namor when the crisis passes. Wakanda launches a secret attack on Atlantis, Namor&#x27;s kingdom, just as Thanos invades Earth. Namor deceives Thanos and leads him to attack Wakanda. The Avengers defeat Thanos, but Shuri learns about T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s collaboration with Namor in the Illuminati. In response to T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s refusal to disclose the extent of their activities, she expels him from Wakandan leadership. T&#x27;Challa is also called upon to destroy a parallel world in order to preserve his own. He is unwilling to do so, and the spirit of his father strips him of the Black Panther powers as a result. Namor then destroys the parallel planet himself and reveals his role in sending Thanos to Wakanda; T&#x27;Challa tries to kill him, and the Illuminati expel him from their group. Namor takes over the Necropolis, beneath Wakanda, and T&#x27;Challa and Shuri invade this subterranean city. T&#x27;Challa ultimately works together with the Illuminati to defeat Namor. T&#x27;Challa is able to transport Namor to another world and abandon him there. However, the various universes continue to collide and threaten all of existence. Doctor Doom, however, is able to create a new reality with himself in control. T&#x27;Challa and Namor are forced to join forces to eventually defeat Doom and restore the previously existing universe. T&#x27;Challa joins a new group called the Ultimates in order to fight Galactus.

Shuri appears to have been killed by invaders. T&#x27;Challa loses his connection with Bast, and his people begin calling him &quot;Haramu-Fal&quot;, meaning &quot;the Orphan King.&quot; Wakanda is damaged and lacking in resources and connections as a result of the various invasions and wars. Wakanda experiences a national crisis as a result of its economic and political difficulties, loss of life, and the blow to their pride as a historically undefeated nation. A political conflict takes place when two of the Dora Milaje attempt to protect women from rape by foreign chieftains and are punished for doing so by Wakanda authorities. They respond by rejecting Wakandan authority and creating their own outpost. Partly as a result of this conflict, Wakandans generally become skeptical of the monarchy. This natural discontent is exploited by Zenzi, who works together with an American businessman to overthrow T&#x27;Challa. At the same time, a university professor named Changamire spreads democratic ideas among Wakandans. An insurgency develops against the Black Panther, and T&#x27;Challa consults with various dictators. Black Panther forms a new group called the Crew, including Storm and Luke Cage in order to counter this insurgency. T&#x27;Challa recruits Changamire to mediate the conflict.

Shuri is revealed to be comatose rather than dead. Her soul is transported to a new realm of Wakandan memory. She learns about their culture prior to the discovery of vibranium. T&#x27;Challa works together with Eden Fesi to recover Shuri. She becomes a new being, Aja-Adanna, who can maintain all Wakandan memory. Shuri can then consult T&#x27;Challa on the future of the nation. Shuri now has the ability to transform into a flock of black birds, a single large black bird, or a stone. Shuri helps to reconcile T&#x27;Challa with the dissident elements of the Dora Milaje. Wakanda embarks on a new path toward a democracy, with monarchy only performing a ceremonial role.

Black Panther later establishes his quest to go across the universe with his people, and found an Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda on Planet Bast, located in the Benhazin Star System.

===Personality and motivations===
T&#x27;Challa is a shrewd political actor whose main concern is the survival and prosperity of his nation, Wakanda. Tom Brevoort, an editor of Black Panther stories at Marvel, says that Black Panther is unique because of his strategic planning. McGregor&#x27;s stories establish that he is emotionally intelligent and naturally intuitive, rather than aristocratic. He is extraordinarily skilled in combat, but often applies deception and strategy to achieve his goals. While he often works independently or alongside the Avengers in order to achieve the collective good, he also has the vast resources of Wakanda at his disposal. In Ta-Nahesi Coates&#x27;s characterization, T&#x27;Challa has an adventurous spirit and does not actually enjoy the burden of being king.

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Black Panther has acute senses as well as extraordinary &quot;speed, strength, reflexes, durability, healing, and stamina.&quot; These capacities partly come from his own training and partly from the properties of a Wakandan heart-shaped herb. The relationship between the heart-shaped herb and Wakanda&#x27;s vibranium resources is unclear.

Black Panther has &quot;peak human&quot; athletic abilities and is one of the most effective fighters in hand-to-hand combat in the Marvel Universe. In his first published appearance, he defeats all of the members of the Fantastic Four single-handedly. For decades after, he was represented as much less formidable, with no distinct powers. Christopher Priest believes this was one of the reasons why the character was under-utilized.

In his contemporary incarnation, he has an armored, bulletproof suit with razor-sharp claws in its finger gauntlets. His mask includes communications equipment, his eye lenses can read ultraviolet and infrared signals, his suit can switch to a camouflage mode, and he has vibranium lacing in his soles to absorb impact. In addition, he has special armor for unusual occasions. Black Panther is unique among superheroes in that he generally has the resources of an entire nation supporting him.

==Themes and motifs==
===Racism and Black pride===
While the early writers of the story were white men, the subsequent authors Priest, Hudlin, and Coates are all Black American men. These writers used the character also to comment on US racism and stereotypes. For example, a cognitive psychologist has argued that Priest&#x27;s depiction of assumptions made by white characters in his stories are an early media representation of microaggressions. This is particularly evinced in the character of Everett Ross, who is constantly misunderstanding his experiences of Africa and Black people because of his unconscious prejudices. Particularly in the Reginald Hudlin period, Black Panther is positioned as a uniquely Black superhero, representing the best and most powerful aspects of contemporary Black masculinity. Reginald Hudlin, one of the character&#x27;s most decisive writers, argues that Black Panther is &quot;the African equivalent of Captain America. Both represent the best of their nations. Not just physically but as moral paragons.&quot;

===Colonialism and decolonization===
The stories also explore imaginary approaches to the circumstances, opportunities, and difficulties of small, resource-rich nations in the Global South. Black Panther&#x27;s character and his fictional kingdom, Wakanda, constitute an early example of what was later called Afrofuturism. As Scott Bukatman writes, Wakanda is &quot;an African nation never conquered, never colonized, never subservient. Small wonder Wakanda was foundational to the ethos and aesthetic later labeled Afrofuturist.&quot; Black Panther&#x27;s first story also establishes that Wakanda is in possession of a valuable natural resource (vibranium) and that various powers wish to violate Wakanda&#x27;s sovereignty in order to obtain that resource. While Lee and Kirby disavowed political motivation, historians of popular culture have commented on the coincidence of Black Panther&#x27;s creation at the same time as Third World revolutionary movements and US Black Power organizations, such as the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Adilifu Nama reads T&#x27;Challa as &quot;an idealized composite of third-world Black revolutionaries and the anticolonialist movement of the 1950s that they represented,&quot; and compares him to Jomo Kenyatta, Patrice Lumumba, and Kwame Nkrumah. However, while many third-world revolutionaries believed in some version of socialism, Wakanda is portrayed as a monarchy. Moreover, while African independence movements were usually skeptical of US national interests they perceived as imperialist, Black Panther is a friendly ally of Captain America and other American superheroes. Martin Lund suggests that the early appearances of Black Panther are partly meant to suggest a clearly anti-communist model of independent African state, to calm Western anxieties about decolonization. Later writers of Black Panther comics such as Ta-Nehisi Coates, Roxane Gay and Nnedi Okorafor, in the 2010s and &#x27;20s, explicitly make the ideal of monarchy problematic and strive to portray a more democratic and inclusive vision of African nationalism. Coates and Gay also emphasize the agency of women and lesbian characters.

===Challenges and transformation of the human body===
The series often emphasizes the vulnerability of the human body, or, conversely, a technologically armored heroic body. In Billy Graham&#x27;s illustrations for Don McGregor&#x27;s 1970s Black Panther stories, his costume is often destroyed and he is frequently depicted as resisting or overcoming immense exertion or suffering. Todd Steven Burroughs describes McGregor&#x27;s rendition of the Panther as &quot;a kind of warrior-priest who could endure suffering as well as any Hindu yogi.&quot; In contrast, Priest&#x27;s and Hudlin&#x27;s runs of Black Panther depict him as extraordinarily powerful, with an armored, bulletproof suit that is rarely damaged. In addition, the later version of the Panther suit includes razor-sharp claws.

==Supporting characters==
===Allies===
Black Panther draws from the combat skills of his bodyguards, the Dora Milaje. When facing cosmic threats, he works together with the Avengers, and has a particularly respectful relationship with Captain America. He also works together with the Crew, which includes Luke Cage and Misty Knight. T&#x27;Challa also sometimes works together with an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, Everett Ross, who is generally hapless.

===Other Black Panthers===
The mantle of the Black Panther is passed down from generation to generation among the rulers of Wakanda. In the diegetic world of the character, there have been thousands of Black Panthers. In the comics, these include a Stone-Age Black Panther named Mosi During World War II, the Panther was named T&#x27;Chanda, who first defeated Captain America and then allied with him to fight the Nazis.

T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s father is T&#x27;Chaka. After having married a woman named N&#x27;Yami, believing she cannot have children, he adopts a child with her, Hunter; however, she later becomes pregnant and dies giving birth to her first child, T&#x27;Challa; from the relationship with a woman of another tribe T&#x27;Chaka then has a second son, Jakarra, and finally remarries with Ramonda, with whom he has his only daughter, Shuri. To protect the kingdom, T&#x27;Chaka instituted a policy of strong isolationism. He is killed by Ulysses Klaw after having surprised him when he was trying to illegally extract vibranium in his kingdom.

Erik Killmonger challenges and beats T&#x27;Challa in a duel for the throne, overthrowing him as king of Wakanda and taking on the role as the Black Panther. He becomes comatose after attempting to ingest the heart-shaped herb to acquire the Black Panther&#x27;s powers, as he is not of royal blood.

When T&#x27;Challa ends up in a coma because of Doctor Doom, Shuri becomes his substitute as the Black Panther and queen of Wakanda which, after the rise of her half-brother to &quot;king of the dead&quot; creates, for the first time in history, two avatars of the Panther Goddess.

===Romantic interests===
In the Don McGregor period, T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s romantic partner was Monica Lynne, an African-American singer. He also had a long-standing relationship with Ororo Munroe, also known as Storm of the X-Men, and they were married for years. Since their divorce, they maintain a close and intimate relationship.

===Villains===
T&#x27;Challa has frequently battled Erik Killmonger, his rival for the throne of Wakanda. He is also frequently in conflict with Doctor Doom and Namor.

==Other versions==

Alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on Black Panther, in which the character&#x27;s origins and context differ from the mainstream setting.

===Ultimate Marvel===

In the alternate reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T&#x27;Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.

Fury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther&#x27;s plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates. This turns out to be a ruse in which Captain America impersonates the Panther, allowing T&#x27;Challa to escape and return home to Wakanda.

After Ultimatum, the Black Panther joins the New Ultimates.

===Ultimate Universe===

During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker visited Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. T&#x27;Challa is the ruler of Wakanda who has Okoye as his queen. Following a nightmare, T&#x27;Challa goes to the Citadel of Knowledge where his father T&#x27;Chaka works. When T&#x27;Chaka assumes that T&#x27;Challa had another nightmare, he claims to T&#x27;Challa that the Gods are trying to speak to him. He is told by T&#x27;Challa to speak with the Divine Mother of the Voduk-Khan who wants T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s counsel. Arriving at the Temple of the Vodu-Khan, T&#x27;Challa meets with Matron Imala who states that enemies will be in Wakanda&#x27;s midst. At the Royal Court of Wakanda, T&#x27;Challa is told by Faxul and Anon about Lord Ra and Lord Khonshu who make up the duo Moon Knight. All T&#x27;Challa and Okoye can recommend at the time is a reconnaissance mission to see if they are a threat. During Wakanda&#x27;s annual Celebration of Life, a female suicide bomber working for Lord Khonshu and Lord Ra crashes the event to take out T&#x27;Challa only for T&#x27;Chaka to push T&#x27;Challa out of the way and take the blast. Upon T&#x27;Challa becoming Black Panther and seeing his father&#x27;s burning remains, he gives the orders to call Okoye, Shuri, and the Vodu-Khan as he quotes &quot;Our enemies call themselves Moon Knight. Wakanda is at war&quot;.

In light of what happened to T&#x27;Chaka, T&#x27;Challa is told by Okoye about different Wakandans being suspected of being collaborators of Moon Knight. He states to Okoye that he will speak with the Vodu-Khan. At the Temple of the Vodu-Khan, Matron Imala tells T&#x27;Challa that a woman of light will come to him as their fates are intertwined. She will give him an heir. Outside the perimeters of Wakanda, the Dora Milaje are holding their own against Moon Knight&#x27;s forces as Shuri tells T&#x27;Challa that it&#x27;s time to turn the tide. Black Panther uses his vehicle to fell the attackers. In the war room, T&#x27;Challa learns from Shuri that Moon Knight is targeting resources. T&#x27;Challa states that someone is feeding Moon Knight information as they are not in the war room. Faxul and Anon reveal that Moon Knight is moving their resources to an area that the migratory animals avoid as T&#x27;Challa states that he will go there alone. When Faxul and Anon state that they are T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s spies and should do the job, T&#x27;Challa states that they are needed in Wakanda to keep his family safe. While Faxul will protect Okoye, Anon will protect Shuri. As Black Panther arrives at the location, his ship crashes and he is ambushed by some soldiers. Just then, lightning from the sky strikes the soldiers as Black Panther sees his flying rescue who he claims is the &quot;woman made of light&quot; that Matron Imala has foretold of.

Following the rescue, Black Panther is taught by Killmonger how to hunt for his own food as seen when Killmonger kills a gazelle and coordinates Black Panther how to harvest the meat while leaving the carcass behind. At the campfire, Black Panther learns that Killmonger used to live in Wakanda before he &quot;got tired of living in paradise while people who looked like me suffered in the world beyond it&quot;. To show Black Panther something with help from Ororo Munroe (who goes by the name of Storm and Wind-Rider), he had his head covered with a hood. Upon arrival being told to take the hood off, they arrive at a cave where they meet Ororo in an underground cave of Vibranium. Black Panther is shown a large green orb that Killmonger and Ororo don&#x27;t want to fall into the enemy hands.

Black Panther returns to Wakanda and saves Shuri from a Moon Knight operative that used to be a Dora Milaje. He states that Lord Khonshu has infected her and that the Vodu-Khan will probe her mind. Just then, the Moon Knight operative is reduced to a skeleton in front of them. As Okoye confronts Black Panther about why he was away for a long time, he tells her that Lord Ra and Lord Khonshu think that they are gods. At the Temple of the Sacred Dead the next morning, T&#x27;Challa introduces Shuri and Okoye to Killmonger and Storm.

Shuri is shown a large metal orb that is not Vibranium as T&#x27;Challa asks Storm to use her abilities on it. Once that was done, a bunch of plants emerge from it causing it to be incinerated. T&#x27;Challa considers its properties to be alchemical as it enhances life. With Lord Ra and Lord Khonshu being silent, T&#x27;Challa advises Shuri not to inform anyone about it as he needs to speak to the Vodu-Khan about it. At the temple of the Vodu-Khan, T&#x27;Challa speaks with Matron Imala about what he has learned. Matron Imala states that the large green orb spreads life like a plague and has been blind to all of existence. Then she states that Lord Ra and Lord Khonshu want it for its power and that she has seen what is to come. Black Panther is told not to let the large green orb fall into Lord Ra and Lord Khonshu&#x27;s hands.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
Black Panther became widely popular since the release of the film &quot;Black Panther&quot; in 2018. Many sources have commended the significance of the character, particularly with regard to the representation of Black people. For example, Anubhav Chaudhry of &quot;Sportskeeda&quot; described Black Panther as a &quot;powerful, regal, and intelligent black hero,&quot; writing, &quot;The introduction of the Black Panther in 1966 marked a pivotal moment in the history of comic books, opening the doors for diverse characters to enter the mainstream.&quot; Laura Bradley of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; included Black Panther in their &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Most Iconic Characters&quot; list, describing him as the &quot;first superhero of African descent in the comics world.&quot; Fred Bluden of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asserts, &quot;As a technological genius, diplomat, statesman, and superhero, Black Panther helped to encourage the creation of other prominent black superheroes who were more than stereotypes. As a character, and a cultural milestone, his importance cannot be overstated.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked Black Panther 1st in their &quot;100 Best Marvel Characters&quot; list. Joseph J. Darowski, in the introduction to &quot;The Ages of Black Panther: Essays on the King of Wakanda&quot;, argues that &quot;The Black Panther&#x27;s place in popular culture history is secured even as it is constantly evolving.&quot; Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Black Panther 26th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s Rank Every Avenger Ever&quot; list, writing, &quot;The Black Panther has one of the most interesting backstory/mythologies in comic books.&quot; &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; ranked Black Panther 79th in their &quot;200 Greatest Comic Book Character of All Time&quot; list.

In 2020, following the death of Chadwick Boseman, Disneyland unveiled a mural at Anaheim&#x27;s Downtown representing the actor giving the Wakanda salute to a young fan wearing a Black Panther mask. In 2021, a wax figure of T&#x27;Challa / Black Panther was unveiled at Madame Tussauds London, inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) incarnation of the character. In 2022, BuyCostumes.com announced that T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s Black Panther costume was the 8th most popular Halloween costume for kids.

==In other media==

In 2018, Marvel Studios released a film adaptation titled &quot;Black Panther&quot;, starring Chadwick Boseman as T&#x27;Challa and directed by Ryan Coogler. &quot;Black Panther&quot; was met with positive reviews from film critics. It became the highest-grossing solo superhero film of all time, the third-highest-grossing film of the MCU and superhero film overall, the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time, and the highest-grossing film by an African-American director. It is the fifth MCU film and 33rd overall to surpass $1billion, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018. It made history as the first superhero film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Chadwick Boseman also portrayed T&#x27;Challa / Black Panther in other media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. T&#x27;Challa appears in the live-action films &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019). The actor voices three alternate timeline versions of T&#x27;Challa in season one of the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;, which were released posthumously. In &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022), T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s sister Shuri (portrayed by Letitia Wright) takes over the mantle of the Black Panther.

Black Panther&#x27;s first animated appearance was in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, voiced by Keith David. In 2010, he later appeared in a self-titled animated TV series on Black Entertainment Television, voiced by Djimon Hounsou. This series was a literal adaptation of Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s arc of the comic series. Subsequently, Black Panther appeared as a supporting character in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;, voiced by James C. Mathis III. and &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, voiced again by James C. Mathis III. The fifth season of the show is named &quot;Black Panther&#x27;s Quest&quot;, with the narrative focus on Black Panther, Shuri, and Wakanda rather than the Avengers. The season was first announced at San Diego Comic-Con, and Daisy Lightfoot provided the voices for Shuri. For young children, the Black Panther appears in &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;, voiced by Tru Valentino. In 2023, Disney announced a new animated series called &quot;Eyes of Wakanda&quot; that will tell the stories of T&#x27;Challa&#x27;s ancestors.

Black Panther has also featured in several video games, such as &quot;&quot;, voiced by Phil LaMarr.

<doc id="1083844" wikidata="Q5426575" url="?curid=1083844" title="FLUID">
<text>FLUID (Fast Light User Interface Designer) is a graphical editor and GUI builder that is used to produce FLTK source code. FLUID edits and saves its state in text .fl files, which can be edited in a text editor for finer control over display and behavior.

After designing the application, FLUID compiles the .fl file into a .cxx file, which defines all the objects from the .fl file, and an .h file, which declares all the global ones. FLUID also supports localization of label strings using message files and the GNU gettext or POSIX catgets interfaces.

A simple program can be made by putting all non-interface code (including a codice_1 function) into the .fl file, thus making the .cxx file a single source file to compile. Most programs are more complex than this, so other .cxx files can be written that call the FLUID functions. These .cxx files must codice_2 the .h file, or they can #include the .cxx file so it still appears to be a single source file.

Normally the FLUID file defines one or more functions or classes, which output C++ code. Each function defines one or more FLTK windows, and all the widgets that go inside those windows.

Widgets created by FLUID are &quot;named&quot;, &quot;complex named&quot;, or &quot;unnamed&quot;. A named widget has a legal C++ variable identifier as its name (i.e. only alphanumeric and underscore), and is defined by a global variable or class member that will point at the widget after the function defining it is called. A complex named object has punctuation such as &#x27;.&#x27; or &#x27;-&gt;&#x27; or any other symbols in its name. In this case, FLUID assigns a pointer to the widget to the name, but does not attempt to declare it. This can be used to get the widgets into structures. An unnamed widget has a blank name and no pointer is stored.

Widgets may either call a named callback function that one writes in another source file, or one can supply a small piece of C++ source and FLUID will write a private callback function into the .cxx file.

==Code View window==
While editing the program FLUID the user can look at the Code View window which shows exactly how the C++ output of the program would look. The Code View window supports auto refreshing (when something in the program is changed, Code View will automatically change the source code being shown) which can be disabled by the user. It won&#x27;t let the user change the code being shown through it. Code View is part of FLUID and is not automatically shown on startup. It can be enabled through FLUID&#x27;s menu.

<doc id="1083854" wikidata="Q936517" url="?curid=1083854" title="Argentine Libertarian Federation">
<text>The Argentine Libertarian Federation (in Spanish, &quot;Federación Libertaria Argentina&quot;, FLA) is a libertarian communist federation which operates in Argentina, out of the City of Buenos Aires, San Pedro, La Pampa Province, and Rosario. Founded in October 1935 with the name of the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina (FACA, &quot;Federación Anarco-Comunista Argentina&quot;) the FLA adopted its current name in 1955. It is governed by the Declaration of Principles and the Organic Charter approved by its congress. Its structure and operation are federative and are coordinated by Local Councils and the National Council.

Since 1985, the FLA has been publishing the political journal &quot;El Libertario&quot;. Prior to that, FLA published &quot;Acción Libertaria&quot;. The FLA is a member of the International of Anarchist Federations (IAF-IFA), the anarchist international which includes member organisations from Italy, Spain, Great Britain, France, Germany and other nations.

==History==
In October 1935, the Federación Libertaria Argentina was founded in La Plata as the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina (, FACA) as a continuation of the Regional Committee for Anarchist Relations (, CRRA), an anarchist assembly that had met since 1932. The FACA was the first specifically anarchist organization in the country.

It established its headquarters in Buenos Aires, and undertook multiple activities in various parts of the country, continuing those previously carried out by the CRRA. One of the first relevant activities it carried out was its participation in the campaign for the freedom of the Bragado Prisoners: Pascual Vuotto, Reclus de Diago and Santiago Mainini were anarchists that had been arbitrarily detained and tortured by the police during the Infamous Decade, falsely accused of having planted a bomb in the town of Bragado on August 5, 1931.

===Spanish Civil War===
Less than a year after the FLA was founded, on July 19, 1936, the Spanish social revolution took place, in the context of the Spanish Civil War launched after the failed coup by nationalist and fascist sectors of the Spanish Army on July 17. In response, different organizations and parties, both communists and anarchists, formed solidarity committees with the Spanish Republic against the military coup. The Coordinating Commission for Aid to Spain was then formed and, for its part, FACA promoted the creation of Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA) and actively participated in the Spanish Propaganda Service founded by the CNT-FAI, appointing and sending delegates from the Federation. Anita Piacenza, Jacobo Prince, Jacobo Maguid and José Grunfeld went to Catalonia to represent the FLA and gave support to the different libertarian organizations in that region, they directed and collaborated in the CNT newspaper &quot;Solidaridad Obrera&quot;.

The first FACA delegate to arrive in Spain was Jacobo Maguid, who went to Catalonia in November 1936 to serve as head of the organizing committee of the International Anarchist Congress. He also worked actively in the FAI Regional Committee, on the newspaper &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot; and in the magazine &quot;Tiempos Nuevos&quot; until December 1938.

This social revolution led many militants to participate directly in the conflict, traveling as combatants to Spain or in support tasks from Argentina. Hundreds of anarchists traveled to join the CNT and the FAI, including members of the FORA such as Diego Abad de Santillán and the FACA, such as Anita Piacenza, Jacobo Maguid, Jacobo Prince and José Grunfeld, among others.

==Activities==
In its own premises, the Casa de los Libertarios, the federation carries out regular meetings, administration, attention to visitors and correspondence, it also has a bookstore, library and archive. Each year they hold conferences, round tables, book presentations, film and video exhibitions, commemorative events, fraternization meetings, artistic and musical evenings. Until the beginning of 1971, 210 issues of its journalistic organ &quot;Acción Libertaria&quot; were published. After a long interruption, from 1985 the newspaper &quot;El Libertario&quot; appeared as its mouthpiece.

Editorial Reconstruir, created and promoted by the FLA, has to its credit a large production of books and brochures, in addition to the bimonthly magazine of the same name published until 1976. Although with less intensity, it continues in the work of disseminating books and publishing works with his own stamp.

<text>The Zimbabwe national football team (nicknamed &quot;The Warriors&quot;) represents Zimbabwe in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA), formerly known as the Football Association of Rhodesia. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals, but has qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations five times. Zimbabwe has also won the COSAFA Cup a record six times. The team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==
Southern Rhodesia played their first official match against the England Amateur national football team as part of the latter&#x27;s tour of South Africa and Rhodesia in June 1929. Southern Rhodesia lost their first two matches against England 4–0 and 6–1, respectively. In 1965, following Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence as Rhodesia, FIFA requested that the Football Association of Rhodesia reform to be a multi-racial organisation. Prior to this, only white Rhodesians were selected for the national football team but after 1965 the team became multi-racial. In 1969, Rhodesia took part in the Oceanic 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament. This was their first attempt to qualify for the FIFA World Cup. Contrary to the team being viewed as the representative team of white Rhodesians, the team was multi-racial including black players. They were drawn against the Australia national football team. Both legs were held in Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique as the Rhodesian team were unable to get Australian visas. Rhodesia drew the first leg 1–1 but lost the second leg 3–1 thus eliminating Rhodesia from qualification.

In 1980, following the country&#x27;s reconstitution as Zimbabwe, they played their first FIFA World Cup qualifying match for 11 years against the Cameroon national football team. However they lost 2–1 on aggregate after a 1–0 win in the first leg in Salisbury and a 2–0 loss in the second leg. Following this, the country passed a law that people who held British passports would not be permitted to hold a Zimbabwean passport, which mean that players such as goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar, who is considered to be Zimbabwe&#x27;s greatest goalkeeper,were not selected for the national team for 10 years. Following a change in policy that allowed Grobbelaar to play for Zimbabwe, who entered the country on his British passport, Zimbabwe under manager Reinhard Fabisch were one match away from qualifying for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However, they lost their final qualifying match to Cameroon.

In 2004, Zimbabwe qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations. During their first match against Egypt, their former anthem &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot; was accidentally played instead of &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu weZimbabwe&quot;, an act which Information Minister Jonathan Moyo called &quot;a cheap attempt by the organisers to demoralise our boys&quot;.

In 2015, the Zimbabwe national football team were banned from participating in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying due to an unpaid debt to former coach, José Claudinei. At the time, the team was experiencing its strongest period for many years, qualifying for both the 2017 and 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.

On 1 March 2022, Zimbabwe, along with Kenya, was suspended again from international sport due to the interference of the government. Earlier in November 2021, Harare and Nairobi dissolved their federations and were replaced with government-officials. On 31 March, the suspension was made indefinitely and was ratified by FIFA. Suspension is set until Zimbabwe and Kenya meet the demands given by FIFA. The team has produced some of the finest footballers the likes of the legendary Peter Ndlovu who played for Zimbabwe 100 times. He featured in the English premier for Coventry City, Birmingham City, Sheffield United and Huddersfield. Peter Ndlovu is well remembered for the hatrick he scored at Anfield against Liverpool, Bruce Grobelaar former Liverpool Goalkeeper, Norman Mapeza former Galatasary defender, Benjan Mwaruwaru former Man city player. Knowledge Musona former Anderletch and Bundesliga player. Khama Billiat former Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs player.

<text>Never, Never, Land is the second album by the British electronic music act UNKLE, released on 22 September 2003. On 24 October 2004 an expanded edition entitled &quot;Never, Never, Land Revisited&quot; was released. The original album debuted at No. 71 in Australia. It was promoted by four singles: &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;, &quot;In a State&quot;, &quot;Reign&quot; and &quot;Safe in Mind&quot;, which was released only as a 12&quot; promo.

The tracks on the album contain audio samples from the movies &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, &quot;THX 1138&quot; and &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. &quot;Panic Attack&quot; samples the beat from &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot; and &quot;Inside&quot; samples the beat from &quot;New Dawn Fades&quot;, both original songs by English post-punk band Joy Division.

<text>A CUSIP () is a nine-character numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a North American financial security for the purposes of facilitating clearing and settlement of trades. All CUSIP identifiers are fungible, which means that a unique CUSIP identifier for each individual security stays the same, regardless of the exchange where the shares were purchased or venue on which the shares were traded. CUSIP was adopted as an American national standard by the Accredited Standards Committee X9 and is designated ANSI X9.6. CUSIP was re-approved as an ANSI standard in December 2020. The acronym derives from Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures.

The CUSIP system is owned by the American Bankers Association (ABA) and is operated by FactSet Research Systems Inc. The operating body, CUSIP Global Services (CGS), also serves as the national numbering agency (NNA) for North America, and the CUSIP serves as the National Securities Identification Number (NSIN) for products issued from both the United States and Canada. In its role as the NNA, CUSIP Global Services (CGS) also assigns all US-based ISINs.

== History ==
The origins of the CUSIP system go back to 1964, when the financial markets were dealing with what was known as the securities settlement paper crunch on Wall Street. At that time, increased trading volumes of equity securities, which were settled by the exchange of paper stock certificates, caused a backlog in clearing and settlement activities. In fact, stock markets had to close early on some days just to allow back-office processing to keep pace. To address the challenge, the New York Clearing House Association approached the ABA to develop a more efficient system for the trading, clearing, and settlement of securities trades by uniquely identifying all current and future securities. Their work was unveiled four years later, in December 1968, with the first publication of the CUSIP directory. 

Over the ensuing years, a growing number of market authorities and regulators came to recognize the value of the CUSIP system and embrace its usage. With sustained reinvestment from the operators of the CUSIP system, CUSIP coverage has steadily grown over the years. It now covers multiple asset classes including government, municipal, and international securities (through the CUSIP International Numbering System, or CINS); initial public offerings (IPOs); preferred stock; funds, certificates of deposit; syndicated loans; and US and Canadian listed options. The CGS database contains issuer and issue-level identifiers, plus standardized descriptive data, for more than 62 million financial instruments and entities. CGS is also the designation numbering agency responsible for assigning the ISIN in over 35 countries. 

CUSIP operates under the guidance of the industry-appointed CUSIP Board of Trustees, made up of senior-level operations and data executives from major banks and other financial institutions. 

=== Antitrust review ===
In November 2009, the European Commission charged S&amp;P Capital IQ with abusing its position as the sole provider of ISIN codes for U.S. securities by requiring European financial firms (in the European Economic Area) and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. The European Commission described the behavior as unfair pricing, noting that in cases such as clearing or regulatory compliance, there are no acceptable alternatives.

In its formal statement of objections, the European Commission alleged that S&amp;P Capital IQ was abusing its position by requiring financial services companies and information service providers to pay license fees for the use of U.S. ISINs. The European Commission claimed that comparable agencies elsewhere in the world either do not charge fees at all, or do so on the basis of distribution cost, rather than usage.

While strongly disagreeing with the European Commission, CGS/S&amp;P Capital IQ offered to create a low-cost, low-value feed of certain US ISINs for use by market participants in the European Economic Area. A formal agreement was reached on November 15, 2011.

==Format==
A CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric code. The first six characters are known as the base (or CUSIP-6), and uniquely identify the issuer. Issuer codes are assigned alphabetically from a series that includes deliberately built-in gaps for future expansion. The 7th and 8th digit identify the exact issue. The 9th digit is a checksum (some clearing bodies ignore or truncate the last digit). The last three characters of the issuer code can be letters, in order to provide more room for expansion.

Issuer numbers 990 to 999 and 99A to 99Z in each group of 1,000 numbers are reserved for internal use. This permits a user to assign an issuer number to any issuer which might be relevant to his holdings but which does not qualify for coverage under the CUSIP numbering system. Other issuer numbers (990000 to 999999 and 99000A to 99999Z) are also reserved for the user so that they may be assigned to non-security assets or to number miscellaneous internal assets.

The 7th and 8th digit identify the exact issue, the format being dependent on the type of security. In general, numbers are used for equities and letters are used for fixed income. For discount commercial paper, the first issue character is generated by taking the letter code of the maturity month and the second issue character is the day of the maturity date, with letters used for numbers over 9. The first security issued by any particular issuer is numbered &quot;10&quot;. Newer issues are numbered by adding ten to the last used number up to 80, at which point the next issue is &quot;88&quot; and then goes down by tens. The issue number &quot;01&quot; is used to label all options on equities from that issuer.

Fixed income issues are labeled using a similar fashion, but due to there being so many of them they use letters instead of digits. The first issue is labeled &quot;AA&quot;, the next &quot;A2&quot;, then &quot;2A&quot; and onto &quot;A3&quot;. To avoid confusion, the letters I and O are not used since they might be mistaken for the digits 1 and 0.

CUSIP also reserves the special characters &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;@&#x27; and &#x27;#&#x27; for use with private placement numbers (PPNs) used by the insurance industry.

The 9th digit is an automatically generated check digit using the &quot;Modulus 10 Double Add Double&quot; technique based on the Luhn algorithm. To calculate the check digit every second digit is multiplied by two. Letters are converted to numbers based on their ordinal position in the alphabet, starting with A equal to 10.

== TBA CUSIP format ==
There is a special assignment of CUSIP numbers for TBA Security. Working with the MBSCC, CUSIP Global Services (CGS) developed a specialized identification scheme for TBA (To Be Announced) mortgage-backed securities.

TBA CUSIPs incorporate, within the identifier itself, a security’s mortgage type (Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac), coupon, maturity and settlement month.

TBA Algorithm:
* Position 1–2: Product Code (e.g., single-family mortgage, ARM, Balloon, etc.)
* Position 3: Type of Mortgage (Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)
* Position 4–6: Coupon
* Position 7: Maturity
* Position 8: Settlement Month
* Position 9: Check Digit
* The exact values for each position are available in a spreadsheet called the TBA Grid.

==Check digit lookup table==
The values below are summed for the first 8 characters, then reduced to 1 digit by formula_1:
==Check digit pseudocode==

 algorithm Cusip-Check-Digit is
 input: &quot;cusip&quot;, an 8-character CUSIP.
 &quot;sum&quot; := 0
 for 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; &lt; 8 do
 &quot;c&quot; := the &quot;i&quot;th character of &quot;cusip&quot;
 if &quot;c&quot; is a digit then
 &quot;v&quot; := numeric value of the digit &quot;c&quot;
 else if &quot;c&quot; is a letter then
 &quot;p&quot; := ordinal position of &quot;c&quot; in the alphabet (A=1, B=2...)
 &quot;v&quot; := &quot;p&quot; + 9
 else if &quot;c&quot; = &quot;*&quot; then
 &quot;v&quot; := 36
 else if &quot;c&quot; = &quot;@&quot; then
 &quot;v&quot; := 37
 else if &quot;c&quot; = &quot;#&quot; then
 &quot;v&quot; := 38
 end if
 if &quot;i&quot; is not &quot;even&quot; then
 &quot;v&quot; := &quot;v&quot; × 2
 end if
 &quot;sum&quot; := sum + int(&quot;v&quot; div 10) + &quot;v&quot; mod 10
 repeat
 return (10 - (&quot;sum&quot; mod 10)) mod 10

<text>Henry Scadding (July 29, 1813 – May 6, 1901) was a Canadian writer and Anglican clergyman.

==Life and career==
Scadding was born at Dunkeswell in Devon, England, and he immigrated to York, Upper Canada (now Toronto, Ontario) in 1821 with his parents, John Scadding and Melicent Triggs. He was educated at Upper Canada College and then attended St. John&#x27;s College at Cambridge University in Cambridge, England, from which he graduated in 1837. 

Scadding was the first boy enrolled at Upper Canada College and now has a Day Boy House named after him there, called Scadding&#x27;s. In 1838, he was appointed to a tutorship at Upper Canada College and was ordained a priest of the Church of England. On August 14, 1841, he married Harriet Eugenia Baldwin (d. 1843) and they had one daughter, Henrietta Millicent Scadding (June 1, 1842 – 1926).

In 1847, Scadding became the rector of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto, a post he held until 1875. He was also a canon of St. James&#x27; Cathedral in Toronto.

Scadding wrote many books, including the &quot;Memorial of the Reverend William Honywood Riply&quot; (1849), &quot;Shakespeare the Seer—the Interpreter&quot; (1864), &quot;Truth&#x27;s Resurrection&quot; (1865), &quot;Christian Pantheism&quot; (1865), &quot;Toronto of Old&quot; (1873), &quot;The Four Decades of York, Upper Canada&quot; (1884) and &quot;A History of the Old French Fort at Toronto&quot; (1887). In his writings, Scadding was principally interested in history and religious themes.

He also edited the &quot;Canadian Journal of Science, Literature, and History&quot; from 1868 to 1878. Scadding was a co-founder and the first president of the York Pioneers, a Toronto-based historical society that preserved Scadding Cabin, which had been built by his father in the early days of the town of York.

==Career==
After graduating from college, Ryan worked at MTV in its special-effects department. She began acting in commercials while studying acting and improvisation in New York City. As an other actor named Susan Ryan was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild, Ryan instead used her middle name. In 2000, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She appeared in the Broken Lizard films &quot;Super Troopers&quot; and &quot;Beerfest&quot;, as well as &quot;Big Helium Dog&quot; and several independent films. Ryan&#x27;s most notable film role was in the 2003 film &quot;Open Water&quot;, for which she won the 2004 Saturn Award for Best Actress. Despite the film&#x27;s success, she appeared in only one film in the next five years. She appeared in four films in 2008 and two in 2009, including &quot;Under New Management&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;.

<text>This is a list of Mazda motor vehicle models. Mazda had used a number of different marques in the Japan market, including Autozam, Eunos, and Efini, although they have been phased out. In the early 1990s Mazda almost created a luxury marque, Amati, to challenge Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus in North America, but this never happened, leaving the near-luxury Millenia to the Mazda brand. Many Mazda vehicles have been rebadged and sold with the Ford brand during the alliance of both companies. Most are noted in the pages of individual vehicles.

Previous sports models of Mazda&#x27;s regular vehicles go by the Mazdaspeed name. Mazdaspeed is Mazda&#x27;s in-house race and street car tuning arm and is highly involved in both amateur and professional motorsports.

<doc id="1083893" wikidata="Q958875" url="?curid=1083893" title="Israel Vibration">
<text>Israel Vibration are a reggae harmony group, originating from Kingston, Jamaica. Lascelle &quot;Wiss&quot; Bulgin, Albert &quot;Apple Gabriel&quot; Craig, and Cecil &quot;Skelly&quot; Spence all contracted childhood polio, and went on to be a Jamaican roots reggae group in the 1970s. The trio initially met as children at a rehabilitation center.

==History==
Bulgin (born 1955), Craig (1955–2020), and Spence (1952–2022) first met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic, all polio patients in the epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950s. Several years later they formed Israel Vibration. Craig attended the Alpha Boys School but ran away at the age of fourteen, living on the streets. Spence was a member of the band Hot Lickers, appearing on Jamaican television with the group at the age of twelve. He also played in the Jamaican wheelchair basketball team but was forced out in 1969 after adopting the Rastafarian faith, something which the three had in common when they were later reunited.

Spence and Craig got together in Kingston and sought out Bulgin, who at the time was working as a tailor. They formed a vocal group, initially adopting the name Israel Vibration Israel Vibrates, soon becoming simply Israel Vibration. They survived on money earned singing in the streets for several years, and in 1975 attempted to launch a recording career at Channel One Studios, but the track they recorded there (&quot;Bad Intention&quot;) was not released.

Funding for their first album came in the form of a grant from the Twelve Tribes of Israel branch of Rastafarai after Hugh Booth, a member of the Twelve Tribes, had overheard the three men singing in a wooded area outside Kingston. Apple and Wiss were living in the area, which they had converted into a home. Recorded at the Treasure Isle studio in 1976, their debut release was the single &quot;Why Worry&quot;, released on the Twelve Tribes label late that year. The single was successful enough for the group to be offered support slots at shows by artists such as Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley.

They then began working with producer Tommy Cowan, releasing &quot;The Same Song&quot; (on which they were backed by members of Inner Circle) on his Top Ranking label in 1977, and an album of the same name followed in 1978. The album, and its dub counterpart, &quot;Israel Tafari&quot; (aka &quot;Same Song Dub&quot;) were a success internationally, leading to a deal with EMI label Harvest to reissue the album in the UK, the label also releasing a second album, &quot;Unconquered People&quot; in 1980.

For their third album, &quot;Why You So Craven&quot; (the title track aimed at their former producer Cowan), they worked with Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes but disagreements meant that they left the album unfinished, with Lawes getting The Tamlins to complete it.

The group relocated to New York in 1982 to seek professional health care, and escape the growing dancehall movement in Jamaica, but struggled to break through there and they split up. They each attempted to launch solo careers, with Bulgin releasing the &quot;Mr Sunshine&quot; album in 1985, but by 1987 they decided to relaunch Israel Vibration. Having all been turned down when they approached Gary &quot;Dr. Dread&quot; Himmelfarb, founder of RAS Records, during their solo period, they received a positive response when they approached him as a group. They were flown to Washington, D.C., to record a new album at the Lion and Fox Recording Studios in College Park, Maryland, backed by the Roots Radics. &quot;Strength of my Life&quot; was the group&#x27;s fourth album. The band stayed with RAS into the 21st century, releasing more than a dozen albums for the label.

In 1997, Apple Gabriel left the group to pursue a solo career, releasing the album &quot;Another Moses&quot; in 1999. Skelly and Wiss continue to record albums and tour the world as Israel Vibration, backed by longtime associates Roots Radics. In December 2014 they were reportedly recording a new album set for release in early 2015. The new album, entitled &quot;Play It Real&quot; was released on 31 March 2015 via Utopia. On March 23, 2020, Albert &quot;Apple Gabriel&quot; co-founder and former member of the group died due to &#x27;compilation sickness&#x27;, earlier reports indicated that Albert was not well for quite some time, this was supposedly due to some of the polio infections left in his body. On a Facebook post on March 7, 2020, he had indicated that he had had a stroke. He died on March 23, 2020. On August 26, 2022, Cecil &quot;Skelly&quot; Spence died of lung cancer.

<doc id="1083901" wikidata="Q1995866" url="?curid=1083901" title="Storge">
<text>Storge ( ; ), or familial love, refers to natural or instinctual affection, such as the love of a parent towards offspring and vice versa.

In social psychology, another term for love between good friends is &quot;philia&quot;.

==Extent==
Storge is a wide-ranging force which can apply between family members, friends, pets and their owners, companions or colleagues; it can also blend with and help underpin other types of ties such as passionate love or friendship.

Thus &quot;storge&quot; may function as a general term to characterize the love between exceptional friends, and their desire to care compassionately for one another.

==Storge love ==
Sometimes the term is used to refer to the love between married partners who are committed and plan to have a long relationship together, particularly as a fundamental relational foundation after initial infatuation (limerence).

Another interpretation for storge is to be used to describe a sexual relationship between two people that gradually grew out of a friendship—storgic lovers sometimes cannot pinpoint the moment that friendship turned to love. Storgic lovers are friends first; the friendship and the storge can endure even beyond the breakup of the relationship. They want their significant others also to be their best friends. They will choose their mates based on similar goals and interests—homogamy. Storgic lovers place much importance on commitment and find that their motivation to avoid committing infidelity is to preserve the trust between the two partners. Children and marriage are seen as legitimate long-term aims for their bond, while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles.

==Advantages==
The advantages of storgic love may be how much storgic lovers love their own families and understand each other. In addition, two people who are deeply devoted to one another can feel the intimacy that they share.

<text>USS &quot;Hake&quot; (SS/AGSS-256) was a of the United States Navy that served during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hake&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched 17 July 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Martha Richards Fletcher, wife of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, and commissioned 30 October 1942.

==Operational history==

=== Atlantic war patrols, April – July 1943 ===
&quot;Hake&quot; departed for shakedown off New London soon after commissioning and after bringing crew and equipment up to fighting efficiency began her first war patrol from New London 8 April 1943. Her mission on this patrol was to search out and destroy German submarines in the North Atlantic, but no contacts were gained and she arrived Helensburgh, Scotland, to terminate the patrol 29 April. She departed for her second patrol, off the Azores and again on antisubmarine patrol, 27 May 1943 and after encountering few submarines returned to New London 17 July.

=== Third and fourth war patrols, December 1943 – April 1944 ===
Newly assigned to the Pacific, &quot;Hake&quot; departed New London 25 August 1943 for San Diego, via the Panama Canal. After a training period off the California coast, she sailed for the western Pacific 6 December. &quot;Hake&quot; armed at Pearl Harbor and departed for her third war patrol 27 December 1943. She sighted the transport &quot;Nigitsu Maru&quot; en route to Japan 11 January 1944 and after a day-long chase to gain position sank her the next day. The submarine then continued to her cruising grounds off the Philippine Islands, patrolling off Luzon and later moving south to Mindanao.

The night of 26 January she attacked a tanker, damaged her, and in turn suffered considerable damage from depth charge attacks before making her escape. Hake next encountered three ships with two escorts 1 February. With the three targets in a line of bearing after a perfect approach, the submarine launched a spread of six torpedoes, sinking two of the three, &quot;Tacoma Maru&quot;, and &quot;Nanka Maru&quot;. The attack achieved complete surprise and &quot;Hake&quot; was not attacked by the screening vessels. She then departed for Fremantle, Australia, terminating the patrol there 20 February 1944.

&quot;Hake&quot;&#x27;s fourth war patrol was spent in the South China Sea near Singapore, following departure from Fremantle 18 March 1944. She encountered her first target 27 March off southwest Borneo, and it was a submariner&#x27;s dream: an unescorted tanker. Two torpedoes sent the ship, &quot;Yamamizu Maru&quot;, to the bottom. After an attack on convoy Hi-55 during the night of 1 April in which &quot;Hake&quot; damaged several ships, she battled escorts and searched for more transports until 30 April, when she arrived at Fremantle.

=== Fifth and sixth war patrols, May – September 1944 ===
For her fifth war patrol, commencing 23 May, &quot;Hake&quot; was assigned the area southwest of Mindanao. Her duty was to attack shipping and to act as a picket to alert American forces to the approach of the Japanese fleet, which was expected to sortie from Tawi Tawi to the Mariana Islands. Sighting destroyer &quot;Kazagumo&quot; 8 June, the sub closed for the attack and succeeded in sinking her adversary, but fierce attacks prevented her from sinking any of the accompanying destroyers. &quot;Hake&quot; also succeeded in sinking two transports during this patrol. Cargo ship &quot;Kinshu Maru&quot; was sunk 17 June after four hits, and a heavily laden troop transport was sunk 3 days later at the entrance to Davao Gulf. She returned to Fremantle 11 July 1944. During this patrol, &quot;Hake&quot; was the witness to the loss of .

&quot;Hake&quot; returned to her patrol area off the Philippines, departing 5 August. During this, her sixth war patrol, she attacked another destroyer, damaging it, but made few additional contacts because of extremely heavy air and surface patrolling by Japanese forces. She arrived at Fremantle Harbor 24 September 1944.

=== Seventh, eighth, and ninth war patrols, October 1944 – August 1945 ===
Departing 20 October for her seventh war patrol, &quot;Hake&quot; encountered few contacts in her patrol area. Operating with and the ill-fated , which was lost on the patrol, &quot;Hake&quot; spent a harrowing 16 hours 7 – 8 November, counting nearly 150 depth charges and sustaining considerable damage.

On 19 November &quot;Hake&quot; torpedoed Japanese light cruiser &quot;Isuzu&quot; west of Corregidor, damaging her rudder.

&quot;Hake&quot; was subsequently sent on a special mission off Panay Island, where she rendezvoused with Filipino guerrillas to bring on board 29 U.S. aviators shot down in recent air attacks. Her valuable cargo safe, &quot;Hake&quot; returned to Australia, arriving Fremantle 16 December.

&quot;Hake&quot; departed Fremantle for her eighth war patrol 12 January 1945. After searching the South China Sea (now almost denuded of targets) for almost a month, she headed for San Francisco, arriving 13 March. After overhaul she departed San Francisco some 2 months later and began her ninth war patrol in the Pacific 20 July 1945. &quot;Hake&quot; acted as lifeguard ship for the air strikes against Japan, and after the surrender had the distinction of being 1 of 12 submarines to witness the historic ceremonies on board the battleship in Tokyo Bay.

=== Post-war service ===
Following the signing, &quot;Hake&quot; started on the long trek back to New London, via the Panama Canal. She decommissioned at New London 13 July 1946, entered the reserve fleet, and was taken out of reserve 15 October 1956 to serve as a Reserve Training Ship for 4th Naval District at Philadelphia, Pa. Her classification was changed to AGSS-256, auxiliary submarine, 6 November 1962. She continued to serve out of commission as a training ship for reservists at Philadelphia until she was struck from the Navy List 1 March 1967 to be sold.

&quot;Hake&quot; received seven battle stars for her service in World War II.

<text>Suuret suomalaiset (&quot;Great Finns&quot;) was a 2004 television show broadcast in Finland by Yle (the Finnish Broadcasting Company), which determined the &quot;100 greatest Finns of all time&quot; according to the opinions of its viewers. The viewers were able to vote during a programme which lasted from October to December 2004. The show was a Finnish spin-off of the BBC&#x27;s programme &quot;Great Britons&quot;. 

==The list==
===The winner===
During the final stage of voting, people had the chance to vote for the following three leading candidates: Risto Ryti, C.G.E. Mannerheim and Urho Kekkonen. The winner was baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a war hero, Marshal of Finland, and president.

===Top Ten===
#C.G.E. Mannerheim (1867–1951) (President of Finland, 1944–1946, and Marshal of Finland)
#Risto Ryti (1889–1956) (President of Finland, 1940–1944)
#Urho Kekkonen (1900–1986) (President of Finland, 1956–1982)
#Adolf Ehrnrooth (1905–2004) (infantry general, a figurehead for the Finnish veteran community)
#Tarja Halonen (1943–) (first female President of Finland, 2000–2012)
#Arvo Ylppö (1887–1992) (famed pediatrician)
#Mikael Agricola (1510–1557) (Protestant reformer and creator of literary Finnish language)
#Jean Sibelius (1865–1957) (world-famous composer of romantic music)
#Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872) (national author)
#Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) (anthropologist)

==Facetious voting and speculation on manipulated results==
Everybody in the top ten can be regarded as &quot;serious&quot; candidates, but right after those first ten are a number of candidates that have probably been selected in a more humorous sense. Positions 11–14 are held by:
* Position 11, Matti Nykänen (1963–2019) – A four-time Olympic gold medalist who is also known for his later ill-fated careers as a singer and a stripper. He is a person loved dearly by the Finnish sensationalist press.
* Position 12, Väinö Myllyrinne (1909–1963) – The tallest Finnish person ever. In the Finnish language, the words &quot;great&quot;, &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;big&quot; can all be expressed with the word &quot;suuri&quot;, which is used in the name of the program. Thus, voting for Myllyrinne was a kind of joke.
* Position 13, Ville Valo (1976–) – The vocalist of the famous Finnish alternative rock band HIM.
* Position 14, Lalli – A mythical and possibly apocryphal figure who, according to a medieval legend, killed Bishop Henry in Finland in 1156.

After the results were published, much speculation started on the issue of whether Yle had manipulated the results to keep facetious candidates out of the top ten. Yle has condemned the accusations but has refused to publish the number of votes that candidates below top ten received.

The person most conspicuously not appearing on the list is the international diplomat and former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari, who has been a perennial favourite in Finland for the Nobel Peace Prize, and was finally awarded it in 2008.

==Advocates==

<doc id="1083910" wikidata="Q3980611" url="?curid=1083910" title="Marching percussion">
<text>Marching percussion instruments are percussion instruments (usually drums, such as snare, bass, and tenor drums) specially designed to be played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics to sling their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums).

The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. These instruments are used by marching bands, corps of drums, drum and bugle corps, fanfare bands, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a &quot;drumline&quot; or &quot;battery.&quot;

==Breakdown==
===Drumline===

A &quot;&quot;drumline&quot;,&quot; also known as the &quot;&quot;battery&quot;,&quot; or &quot;&quot;batterie&quot;,&quot; is a section of percussion instruments usually played as part of a musical marching ensemble. A drumline can also be a section on their own competing against other drumlines. Marching bands, drum and bugle corps, and indoor percussion ensembles are some examples of groups that include a drumline.

The term &quot;drumline&quot; derives from the North American drum &amp; bugle corps activity. In the 1940&#x27;s 1950&#x27;s, 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, state and national drum &amp; bugle corps championships were sponsored by two Veterans organizations, the American Legion and the VFW. Corps had to submit to Inspections. Inspection Judges would look for dirty or missing uniform parts, damaged equipment, loose threads, badly polished shoes, bad grooming and the like. National Championships were often lost because of infractions discovered by the Inspection Judge. The corps had to stand in line, by section, or in a single line during these Inspections. Thus there was a &quot;horn line&quot;, a flag line&quot;, and a &quot;drum line&quot;. These terms are still common today in the drum corps activity. 

Prior to the late 1970&#x27;s marching bands had &quot;drum sections&quot; not drum lines (or drumlines). The &quot;drum line&quot; term began to be used by other marching percussion ensembles in the 70&#x27;s along with the instrumentation used in the drum &amp; bugle corps activity. This includes multi-tenor drums and pitched bass drums with split parts, embellishments like back-sticking and stick tosses, and innovations like mylar drumheads. All of these were developed in and originated in the North American drum &amp; bugle corps activity.

The battery marches on the field in a group as opposed to the stationary front ensemble. The battery usually consists of snare drums, bass drums, tenor drums, and cymbals. In the past, marching timpani were common, as were marching keyboard percussion instruments such as glockenspiels and xylophones. However, due to the addition of the front ensemble, all pitched percussion instruments have since been grounded. A relatively small number of bands, mostly at the collegiate level, continue to field such traditional marching keyboard instruments; however, most bands have phased out their use.

====Snare drums====

Marching snare drums have high-tension heads made out of Kevlar or PET film. In the past, snares were typically carried with slings. Slings caused the drums to tilt right causing discomfort in the left hand. Due to this discomfort, traditional grip was created.

Most modern snare drums have rigid over-the-shoulder harnesses that hold the drum with the playing surface parallel to the ground, which affords the option of performing with matched grip. Even with the option of performing matched grip, most competitive groups opt to use traditional grip. Traditional grip allows for more exciting visuals or tricks which are important in the competitive drumming world.

The center, or head, snare player (a position typically held by the most experienced snare drummer) is usually the ensemble&#x27;s leader. When rehearsing or performing, the center snare may &quot;tap off&quot; the ensemble, setting the tempo with a solo rhythm.

Musically, the snare drum section has the most rudimentarily challenging &quot;book&quot;, or music. The instrument&#x27;s role is that of the soprano line, typically carrying the melody or the main rhythm of the ensemble.

Marching snare drums are deeper in size than snares normally used for orchestral or drum kit purposes. This gives the drum the big, full sound necessary for outdoor use. Standard sizes (listed as diameter x depth) are 13x11 and 14x12 inches. Smaller sizes such as 13x9 have become increasingly popular in recent times with the proliferation of indoor drum lines.

The modern &quot;high tension&quot; snare was developed in response to the higher head tensions made possible with the development of Kevlar and other high strength fibers bonded into the drumhead. High tension drums began and were perfected in the pipe band market and later moved into the marching band and drum corps areas. The bottom (or &quot;resonant&quot;) side of the drum has a tightly tuned head and synthetic gut or metal snare wires, which are often secured to the drum using a strainer to limit their movement and make the sound more staccato. For outdoor use, a projector or &quot;scoop&quot; - a piece of curved plastic - may be attached to the back of the bottom hoop to help project the sound forward to the audience.

Snare drums used in pipe bands are similar in construction to standard marching snare drums, with two key differences. First, the drum has an additional set of snares, directly under the batter (top) head. Second, the snares under the bottom head are made of coiled steel wires, similar to a drum set (as opposed to the synthetic &quot;gut&quot; snares on a corps-style drum). These differences tend to give the pipe drums a &quot;snappier&quot; snare sound, emphasizing the higher frequencies of the drum. Recently, corps-style drums have been produced with steel wire snares underneath the batter head (while remaining the gut snares under the bottom head). These snares are able to be switched on and off separate from the bottom snares, which allows units to use the second snares as a specific effect or as a permanent modification to the sound of the drum.

The head of the snare drum can also be varied to give the drum a different sound. Depending on the music or style that the drumline plays, different brands and types of heads may be used. For maximum volume and stick articulation, a head made of woven Kevlar fibers is used and usually tuned to very high tension. If the player desires a slightly &quot;softer&quot; feel, then an aramid fiber head may be used. Additionally, if more overtones and the softest head-feel are desired, the player may want to consider a heavy clear head with a center reinforcement dot. This type of head is rarely used today among competitive drumlines, mostly owing to its lack of outdoor projection in comparison with Kevlar, but nonetheless, it may still be used if a unique timbre is desired. One of the most famous marching bands utilizing this head is the Ohio State University Marching Band, however, recently, they have switched to the more modern high-tension Aramid-fiber heads.

====Tenor/quad drums====

Marching tenor drums (also called quads/quints) are single-headed tonal drums. Modern tenor configurations usually have four drums and one to two special effect drums known as spocks. The spocks are tuned relatively high and are used to play parts that cut through the ensemble. Tenor players add pitch variety to the drumline with drums of different sizes.

Tenor players use matched grip and generally play with mallets with plastic disc-shaped heads, though traditional drumsticks and softer mallets are commonly used to achieve different timbres.

Single tenor drums, also known as flubs, are popular in HBCUs, pipe bands or as starting points for inexperienced drummers and are beaten using soft or hard mallets. Either in the single or the multiple form, these tenors can be mounted on the chest, like bass drums, or horizontally, like traditional snares.

Tenor drums are aptly the tenor voice of the ensemble, as well as one of the most melodic. Tenor drums often have parts that mirror what the winds or front ensemble is playing. Because there is often more than one drum, various visuals can be used when performing drum changes such as &quot;crossovers&quot; or &quot;sweeps&quot;.

Marching multiple tenor drums can weigh anywhere between 30 and 45 pounds, depending on the model, and number of drums. This means they are typically the heaviest drums in the drumline.

Modern marching bands and drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several single-headed tom-toms played by a single drummer. The bottoms of the shells are open and beveled to project the sound of the drum forward. Double-ply PET film heads are typically used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drumsticks, drum brushes, and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtones, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.

A full-size set of tenors consists of 10, 12, 13, and toms arranged in an arc, often with an additional one or two smaller (6 or 8-inch) toms called &quot;gock&quot;, &quot;shot&quot;, or &quot;spock&quot; drums inside of the arc. Because a full-sized set of tenors with a carrier can exceed 55 pounds smaller and lighter versions of tenors outfitted with 8, 10, 12, and toms are often used by lines with smaller or younger players. All multi-tenors based on the four-drum configuration are called &quot;quads&quot; despite the fact that there may be a total of five or six drums counting the gock drums. Sets with one gock drum are called &quot;quints&quot;, and sets with two gock drums are called &quot;sextets&quot;, &quot;squints&quot;, &quot;hexes&quot;, or &quot;sixpacks&quot;. To produce different sounds between spock drums with the same diameter, the head type, shell depth, and/or tuning between the two drums may vary. A common name for all multi-tenors is simply, &#x27;Tenors&#x27;. Tenor drums have often been compared to the Latin percussion timbales, as many musicians, including Tito Puente use a setup similar to modern marching tenors.

Lines of as few as 1 or 2 tenor drummers are common in high schools and junior high schools. Many large college marching bands have 5 or more. Most drum corps consider 4 or 5 tenors to be optimal.

The modern multi-tenors evolved from horizontally mounted dual single-headed bass drums first used by the Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps in the late 1960s. Early multi-tenors had shells with a flat bottom. These drums sounded a lot like timpani, so they were called &quot;timp-toms&quot;. As drum sizes got smaller, more drums began to be added to multi-tenor configurations. The largest sets of multi-tenors had 7 drums and were carried by both the 1977 and 1992 Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps tenor lines.

Scottish pipe bands use a single tenor drum as part of their drum corps section. Traditional marching bands and drum corps may also use single tenors, which are double-headed drums much like snare drums but without snares, and only use either mallets (one or two, the former used in Spain and Italy and the latter in the UK and Commonwealth, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) or sticks (the latter in marching bands in France). The Scottish form tenors are played with bigger mallets, while regular single tenors have small mallets, all are covered with felt or cotton. Such drums are used either with the sling mount or shoulder mount. Some show bands such as those at historically black colleges and universities use both single tenors and multi-tenors.

====Bass drums====


Bass drums used by modern ensembles come in a variety of sizes, with a 14 inch &quot;universal&quot; depth, and diameter measured in 2 inch increments from 14 to 32 inches. The heads of these drums are usually made of a smooth white PET film, which gives a tonality that is midway between clear and coated heads. Unlike tenors and snares, bass drums are mounted so that the cylindrical shell of the drum is mounted on the player&#x27;s harness and the two drum heads of the drum face out sideways. The player can then play on both heads, one arm for a drum head on either side. Each drummer plays and carries one drum, and a line is created by having several people carry different-sized drums. Such drums are called &quot;tonal bass drums&quot;. The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps were the first marching unit to use and standardize tonal bass drum tuning. Many groups try to use the largest size bass drum that is comfortable for the physically largest bass drummer to carry as the bottom bass drum, as larger people are generally better able to carry a bigger drum for many hours.

In corps-style bands, each bass drummer only plays one segment of the entire bass drum part, unlike the snares and tenors. This is known as a &quot;split part&quot;. A &quot;unison&quot; refers to when all or some bass drummers play together at the same time. Lines can vary in size from as few as 3 players in small high schools to as many as 9 in very large college marching bands. A line of 5 (with individual drum sizes ranging from 18 to 32-inches) is the most common in a drum corps. Some traditional groups, such as some show-style marching bands from historically black colleges and universities continue to use a non-tonal bass drums, where each drum is roughly the same size and each drummer plays the same part.

Pipe bands and some traditional groups use a single bass drummer, who typically carries the pulse of the group. The bass drums used by pipe bands have seen an increase in size and more of a focus on tone in recent times. Typical sizes range from 12 to 18-inches deep by 28 inches in diameter. The goal is to produce a subtle deep tone which is usually in tune with the drones of the bagpipe. Various muffling techniques (sometimes referred to as &quot;treatments&quot;) can be used on bass drums to achieve a desired sound. The most common of these involve applying foam weatherstripping, either on the head directly or on the shell of the drum. Some drumhead manufacturers make heads that are &quot;pre-muffled.&quot; These heads usually have separate pieces of PET film or other material which are set into the head&#x27;s flesh hoop and touch the head to control overtones.

Drumlines most frequently use pitched bass drums as tonal drums split between several percussionists. Marching bass drums, which produce the deepest sound in the battery, are larger drums carried on harnesses or straps with the heads facing to the left and right of the player. The musicians carrying the bass drums typically line up in drum size order, but will also assume various positions for the purpose of a drill. Bass drummers use mallets with rounded or cylindrical heads often made of hard felt. High school, Colleges, and drum corps drumlines typically consist of four to six different bass drum sizes to ensure enough for a melody. Sometimes, in smaller bands, one may see only two or three bass drummers perform. A bass drum can weigh anywhere between 15 pounds and 40 pounds, depending on the model and size. Each drummer plays a unique part, though the entire bass drum part is conceived as a whole. This allows for a melodic passage to be carried throughout the bass drumline, having runs of notes that flow up or down the drums and in pitch. In addition to these &quot;split&quot; parts, bass drummers will also have unison notes, where everyone plays at the same time. In addition to splits and unison hits, sometimes the basses will play a rim click, in which they will hit a metal bar attached to the rim of the drum. This is mainly used for subdividing rhythms, and are mainly used when the snares play one or more rim shots and the basses have a unison note on the offbeat.

====Cymbals====
Marching cymbals are typically pairs of clash cymbals usually around 18 to 20-inches in diameter. Cymbals larger than 20-inches are usually too heavy to be marched comfortably and cymbals smaller than 18-inches lack the sonic capabilities to project from the field to the stands. Oftentimes, each player in a cymbal line will have a different sized pair of cymbals than their peers because to carry out different sounds and tones depending on what the music or percussion director calls for.

Cymbals are typically not played in the same manner as orchestral crash cymbals. Marching cymbalists use a special type of grip known as the &quot;Garfield grip&quot; (named after its use by the Garfield Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps) where the hand goes through the leather strap and twists, causing the hand to be flat against the bell of the cymbal. This allows for greater control over the cymbals and for the cymbalists to perform visual effects – movements such as twirls and flips that are eye-pleasing.

Among the differences between marching and orchestral cymbal are the many types of specialty crashes and effects. Crash-chokes are played beginning with a normal crash but pulled into the body at the shoulders or stomach as to effectively stop the sound after attaining the desired crash. Slides, or sizzle-sucks, are played using the right cymbal to drive into the left, where the outer edge hits half-way between the bell and the edge of the left cymbal. After the right cymbal slides up on the left, it is brought back straight into the body. The cymbal is stopped by catching the air pocket inside of the cymbals. The cymbals maintain contact at all times. The desired sound is a &quot;sizzle then choke&quot; effect.

Cymbal parts are often split in the same manner as bass drum parts – each cymbalist plays one component of a larger part. Snare drummers may play on the cymbals as ride cymbals or like hi-hats.

Many contemporary field ensembles do not utilize a cymbal line, instead having cymbals played within the front ensemble. In indoor percussion ensembles, the trend seems to be towards keeping or expanding cymbal sections.
====Mallet percussion====

The glockenspiel is the mallet percussion instrument most often used as a part of the battery. The tradition of marching the glockenspiel as part of the battery is common in many countries, such as in the Filipino drum and lyre corps. In the early 1970s, mallet percussion was first allowed into drum corps in competitive circuits, such as Drum Corps International. At first, only glockenspiels and xylophones were allowed, but starting in 1976 marimbas and vibraphones were also allowed. The 27th Lancers Drum and Bugle Corps even rigged up homemade racks to march tubular bells.

Eventually, in 1981, within North American bands and corps, mallet instruments were allowed to be grounded, as arrangers felt limited by the instruments they were able to write for, and marching the heavy equipment became detrimental to the members&#x27; health. Since then, most corps or bands have kept their mallet instruments in the front as part of the front ensemble, or &quot;pit&quot; (other countries, however, have kept the practice of marching the glockenspiel while adopting the front ensemble tradition).

====Timpani====
Like the marching mallet percussion, timpani were marched when drum corps required everything to be marched. The marching timpani were made of fiberglass, and were played by a four- or five-man line (similar to a modern-day bass drum line). The timpani were cranked by a handle sticking up on the side of the drum. Sometimes intricate, complex music was made using the possibilities of 4 or 5 players. While one man was cranking/tuning, another was playing. To help with intonation issues, some timpani came equipped with tuning gauges.

During concert pieces, timpani were often grounded momentarily, using a tripod leg system. Eventually, in 1981, like the mallet instruments, timpani were allowed to be grounded paving the way to the modern-day front ensemble. Some corps, like the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps, started using balanced action timpani played by only one player to open up new positions for other members. However, not all corps could afford a new set of concert timpani and simply grounded their marching timpani.

====Turkish crescents====
In several countries, there exists a Turkish-derived tradition of carrying a Turkish crescent as part of the percussion section of bands or field music, by itself having Central Asian origins. It arrived in Europe as part of the trend of adopting Turkish musical forms in the 18th century, when Turkish musicians from various Ottoman military bands in the Ottoman Empire, majority of them Janissaries, were employed to form part of a growing number of military bands, introducing this instrument to the West together with the cymbals and bass drum. By the 19th century, it had been adopted as part of the percussion battery of military marching bands in a number of countries.

Its heyday in Europe was from the mid-18th to mid-19th century, when it was commonly played often by elaborately dressed black Africans in a number of countries (like France and the United Kingdom), who made all manner of contortions while playing the instrument in the battery section. Some of these gestures survive today, in the stick twirling by bass and tenor drummers. An aspect of the elaborate costumes survives in the leopard skin apron worn by bass drummers in British military bands; however the use of the &quot;Jingling Johnny&quot; was discontinued in the British Army in 1837. By the 19th up to the early 20th century, Turkish crescents were used in processions honoring important dignitaries as part of the band percussion section or in front of the leading ranks. They were skillfully twirled by dignified performers, much as batons are handled today by drum majors. This aspect survives today in the use of Turkish crescents as mostly symbolic objects in military marching bands. Today, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Chile, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia, among others, still preserve the use of the instrument, albeit in the ceremonial form, but not playable, as part of the percussion unit or at the head of the band and/or field music ensemble. It is still a valuable part of the Ottoman bands that still use it to this day in Turkey, where they form part of the percussion unit.

The instrument is held vertically and when played is either shaken up and down or twisted. Sometimes there is a geared crank mechanism for rotating it. Most often, the bearer of the instrument holds the pole or the bottom part carefully in order to ensure great care in using the instrument, as seen in a number of bands and field music in several countries, as the instrument is secured on a strap similar to those of British side drums.

== Stick heights ==

=== Snares and tenors ===
Marching bands in general and especially marching drum lines emphasize uniformity. To achieve absolute uniformity, every member of the drumline must play with proper stick heights. A stick height is an approximate measurement of how high the bead of the stick comes off the drum head on any given note. Regularly used heights range from 3&quot; to 12&quot;, with 1&quot; and 15&quot; being used mostly for visual effect. Snares and tenors can use this chart to establish guidelines for stick heights, but techniques and specifications may vary between lines and can be changed depending on what the music calls for. While those sticks or mallets used in multiple tenors follow those of mallet percussion, traditional drumsticks of the same height, as well as soft wrapped mallets made of yarn or felt, are used, while the latter are useful for those playing the single tenor, but there are differences, with small coverings for the usual marching single tenor and large ones for the Scottish form.

=== Bass drums ===
Bass drums do not use the same guidelines as snares and tenors. They are grouped in a different section of the battery. Below are the guidelines for bass drum heights. Again, techniques and specifications vary between drumlines. (All fractions are based on the Forte / perpendicular height. Establish this height first and then work the others around it.) It is advised for a player to commence in “set” position with the mallets about 1 inch away from the head.

Stick heights are not only important for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights on the right and left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick or mallet heights, it is advisable to set up a drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if the left heights are even with the right heights. If the player has access to a video camera, it can be personally recorded for later viewing. It is easier to watch one&#x27;s mallet or stick heights and critique one&#x27;s performance when not being focusing on playing.

==Harnesses==

The original harnesses for the marching glockenspiel and xylophone were made of straps, which sometimes interfered with playing on the high end of the instrument or interfered with four-mallet playing. There were poles on the high and low ends of the keyboards sticking up a few inches, with straps going around the player&#x27;s neck, making them look similar to a peanut vendor. Eventually, before the use of marching marimbas and vibraphones, a new style of harness was made. The new harness was a vest, similar to what is usually used today for marching percussion.

Harnesses for the timpani were originally just slings. Corps usually used 2 snare slings and hook them around the player, and onto his timpani. Some corps rigged wooden blocks between the drum and the player, to help balance issues, as the drums were carried high on the body. Some corps used harnesses for a few years, while some continued using slings.

<text>The 2004 National League Championship Series (NLCS) was a playoff series in Major League Baseball’s 2004 postseason played from October 13 to 21 to determine the champion of the National League. It featured the Central Division champion and overall #1 seed St. Louis Cardinals, and the wild-card qualifying Houston Astros. This marked the first time in either Major League that two teams from the Central Division met in a Championship Series.

In a series in which all seven games were won by the home team, the Cardinals won 4–3 to advance to the World Series against the American League champion Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox reached their first World Series since 1986, with the Cardinals playing in their first since 1987. While the NLCS was an exciting back-and-forth series, it was overshadowed in media attention by Boston&#x27;s 3-0 comeback in the ALCS.

==Game summaries==

===Game 1===
Wednesday, October 13, 2004 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri , mostly clear
The series opener at St. Louis&#x27; Busch Stadium was a slugfest involving five home runs, 17 runs, and 22 hits, eventually won by St. Louis, 10–7. Houston struck the first blow of the series when Carlos Beltrán hit a two-run home run in the top of the first inning after a leadoff single off Woody Williams. The Cardinals answered with a home run by Albert Pujols in the bottom half after a one-out triple off Brandon Backe, tying the game at two. Houston took a 4–2 lead in the fourth inning on a two-run home run by Jeff Kent, but the Cards tied it again in the fifth on Larry Walker&#x27;s RBI double off Backe and Scott Rolen&#x27;s RBI single off Chad Qualls. In the sixth, Edgar Renteria and Reggie Sanders hit back-to-back leadoff singles before a sacrifice bunt moved them up one base. Pinch hitter Roger Cedeno&#x27;s groundout scored Renteria to put the Cardinals up 5-4 for the first time in this game. Tony Womack followed with an RBI single, then stole second before scoring on Walker&#x27;s single aided by shortstop Jose Vizcaino&#x27;s error. After Qualls walked Pujols, Chad Harville in relief walked Rolen to load the bases before Jim Edmonds cleared them with a double to put the Cardinals up 10–4. The Astros cut it to 10−6 with a two-run home run from Lance Berkman in the eighth off Ray King. Next inning, a two-out solo home run from Mike Lamb off Julián Tavárez made it 10−7. Craig Biggio then hit a ground-rule double before Jason Isringhausen relieved Julián Tavárez and got Beltran to ground out to first on the first pitch to end the game. All seven of the Astros&#x27; runs in Game 1 were scored on home runs.

===Game 2===
Thursday, October 14, 2004 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri , scattered showers
The Astros scored three runs off Cardinals&#x27; Matt Morris on home runs by Carlos Beltran in the first and Morgan Ensberg in the fourth. Lance Berkman added an RBI single in the fifth with two on, but in the bottom of the inning, two-run home runs from Larry Walker off starter Peter Munro and Scott Rolen off reliever Chad Harville put the Cardinals up 4−3. The Astros tied it in the seventh off Kiko Calero when Berkman hit a leadoff double, stole third and scored on Ensberg&#x27;s single, but the Cardinals retook the lead in the bottom of the eighth inning with back-to-back home runs from Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen off Dan Miceli. Jason Isringhausen pitched a scoreless ninth despite allowing two walks as the Cardinals&#x27; 6−4 win put them up 2−0 in the series heading to Houston.

===Game 3===
Saturday, October 16, 2004 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas , roof closed
In the first game of the series played in Houston&#x27;s Minute Maid Park, the Cardinals went up 1−0 in the first on Larry Walker&#x27;s one-out home run, but the Astros tied it in the bottom of the inning off Jeff Suppan on Lance Berkman&#x27;s RBI single before Jeff Kent&#x27;s two-run home run put them up 3−1. Jim Edmonds&#x27; leadoff home run in the second cut it to 3−2, but the Astros added two insurance runs in the eighth on home runs from Carlos Beltran off Dan Haren and Berkman off Ray King. Roger Clemens pitched seven innings for the 5−2 win, which left the Astros trailing 2–1 in the series.

===Game 4===
Sunday, October 17, 2004 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas , roof closed
The Cardinals struck first in Game 4 when Roy Oswalt walked Larry Walker with one out before Albert Pujols hit a two-run home run. Scott Rolen then doubled, moved to third on a groundout, and after a walk, scored on John Mabry&#x27;s single to put the Cardinals up 3−0. The Astros cut it to 3−1 in the bottom of the inning when Carlos Beltran walked with one out off Jeff Bagwell&#x27;s double off Jason Marquis. In the top of the third, Pujols drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Rolen&#x27;s single and scored on Jim Edmonds&#x27; sacrifice fly, but the Astros cut the lead to 4−3 when Beltran and Bagwell singled with one out and scored on Lance Berkman&#x27;s double. Pujols&#x27;s single with two on in the fourth put the Cardinals up 5−3, but the Astros cut the lead back to one on Berkman&#x27;s leadoff home run in the sixth off Kiko Calero. Jose Vizcaino doubled two outs later and scored on Raul Chavez&#x27;s single to tie the game. Next inning, Beltran&#x27;s home run off Julián Tavárez put the Astros up 6−5. Brad Lidge pitched two shutout innings for the save as the Astros evened the series with the Cardinals at two games apiece. Beltrán tied records for the most home runs in a single postseason (8) and most consecutive postseason games with a home run (5). The latter record would be broken by Daniel Murphy in Game Four of the 2015 NLCS.

===Game 5===
Monday, October 18, 2004 at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas , roof closed
The Astros defeated the Cardinals 3–0 in Game 5 with Jeff Kent driving in the winning runs with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth off Jason Isringhausen. Astros starter Brandon Backe took a perfect game into the fifth inning, when he walked Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds, and allowed only one hit (a single to second baseman Tony Womack in the sixth) in eight innings. The Cardinals&#x27; Woody Williams was nearly as effective, allowing only one hit (a two-out single to Jeff Bagwell in the first) and two walks over seven innings. Kent&#x27;s home run was the first walkoff postseason home run for an Astro player since Alan Ashby in Game 1 of the 1981 National League Division Series. Houston led the best-of-seven series 3–2 and was one win away from their first World Series appearance.

===Game 6===
Wednesday, October 20, 2004 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri , overcast
Returning to St. Louis, Matt Morris started Game 6 for the Cardinals, as did Pete Munro for the Astros. The scoring began with Carlos Beltrán walking with one out, stealing second, moving to third on a single, and scoring on Lance Berkman&#x27;s sacrifice fly in the first. The Cardinals responded in the bottom of the inning with a two-run home run by Albert Pujols. In the third, Beltrán singled with two outs and scored on Jeff Bagwell&#x27;s double to tie the game. Again, the Cardinals responded when Édgar Rentería hit a two-run single scoring Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen in the bottom of the inning. Mike Lamb&#x27;s home run in the fourth cut the Cardinals&#x27; lead to 4−3. In the top of the ninth inning Bagwell hit a two-out single off Jason Isringhausen, scoring Morgan Ensberg for the tying run. The game went into extra innings and ended when Jim Edmonds, who hit 42 home runs in the regular season, hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the 12th off Dan Miceli, sending the series to a Game 7 showdown.

===Game 7===
Thursday, October 21, 2004 at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri , overcast
The final, deciding Game 7 started off with Astros&#x27; leadoff man Craig Biggio smacking a home run in the game&#x27;s first at-bat off Cardinals&#x27; starter Jeff Suppan to make it 1–0. The Astros&#x27; threat continued in the second by putting two men on, but, thanks to a tremendous catch by center fielder Jim Edmonds, the Cardinals were able to get out of the inning unscathed. In the third, however, the Astros made it 2–0 with Carlos Beltrán, who walked and stole second, scoring on Jeff Bagwell&#x27;s sacrifice fly aided by Edmonds&#x27;s error. The Cardinals cut it to 2−1 in the bottom of the inning when Tony Womack hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Jeff Suppan&#x27;s bunt groundout. Then in the sixth Albert Pujols doubled to score Roger Cedeno from third to tie the game and Scott Rolen put the Redbirds ahead with a two-run home run off Roger Clemens. St. Louis added another run in the eighth off Roy Oswalt when pinch hitter Marlon Anderson hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Larry Walker&#x27;s single. Jason Isringhausen shut down Houston in the ninth to win the Cardinals their first National League pennant in 17 years.

<doc id="1083914" wikidata="Q5230476" url="?curid=1083914" title="David A. Hargrave">
<text>David Allen Hargrave (May 25, 1946 – August 29, 1988), known as &quot;The Dream Weaver&quot;, was a prolific and sometimes controversial American game designer and writer of fantasy and science fiction role-playing games (RPGs). Hargrave&#x27;s most notable written works were based upon his own mythical world of &quot;Arduin&quot;.

==Military service==

Hargrave served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War for six years, serving from August 28, 1964, through August 20, 1970. While in Vietnam, Hargrave regularly served as a combat photographer, often in the line of fire.

==Role playing games==

===Arduin===
From the mid-1970s through 1988 Hargrave was very active in the role-playing community. He authored ten books based upon his &quot;Arduin&quot; game world. Hargrave also produced four &quot;Arduin Dungeon Modules&quot; and several fantasy item collections, which were published by Grimoire Games. Hargrave originally submitted his Arduin Grimoire to Greg Stafford&#x27;s publishing house Chaosium, in 1977, but Stafford rejected it as too derivative of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Hargrave wound up self-publishing Arduin before having it published over the years at small press companies: The aforementioned Grimoire Games, then later Dragon Tree Press, and finally Emperors Choice Games.

===Historical context===
Hargrave&#x27;s work was perhaps the first &quot;cross-genre&quot; venture into fantasy RPG, and it included everything from interstellar wars to horror and historical drama. His work was, however, based principally upon the medieval fantasy genre. Arduin was in fact one of the earliest challengers to TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and a leading representative of the high-entropy, multiversal campaigns then prevalent in RPG circles of the era.

===Controversy===
While Hargrave was considered one of the best Gamemasters, he was also known for having a somewhat volatile personality. The original role-playing community at large was split between love and mere tolerance of Hargrave&#x27;s passions (his falling-out with Greg Stafford, which resulted in Hargrave naming a spell after him as revenge, is one such example.)

===Other works===
Hargrave also frequently contributed to various magazines such as &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, &quot;Alarums and Excursions&quot;, and &quot;Abyss&quot;. As a game designer, he authored various &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; adventures for Chaosium, Inc., and was an integral part of the design team for the sci-fi game &quot;Star Rovers&quot;, among others.

===Multiversal Trading Company===
Around 1979, Hargrave operated a game store in Concord, California, called Multiversal Trading Company. 

===Death===
For years, Hargrave had suffered a heart disability with diabetic complications. He died in his sleep August 29, 1988. He was survived by his wife, Brigitte Hargrave.

<doc id="1083915" wikidata="Q258516" url="?curid=1083915" title="Pre-Christian Alpine traditions">
<text>The central and eastern Alps of Europe are rich in folklore traditions dating back to pre-Christian times, with surviving elements originating from Germanic, Gaulish (Gallo-Roman), Slavic (Carantanian) and Raetian culture.

== Survival through the ages ==

Ancient customs survived in the rural parts of Austria, Switzerland, Bavaria, Slovenia, western and northern Croatia and north eastern Italy in the form of dance, art, processions, rituals and games. The high regional diversity results from the mutual isolation of Alpine communities. In the Alps, the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and paganism has been an ambivalent one. While some customs survived only in the remote valleys inaccessible to the church&#x27;s influence, other customs were actively assimilated over the centuries. In light of the dwindling rural population of the Alps, many customs have evolved into more modern interpretations.

==Pastoral traditions==
Around September 8, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, it is customary to bring the cattle down from the upland pastures for the winter. In Bavaria, women weave fir wreaths decorated with paper roses and small mirrors to ward off demons during the downhill journey. It has been suggested that this may have been derived from end-of-summer festivals for the Germanic goddess Iðunn; however, it is also appropriate that shepherds would have come down from the alps on the feast of the birth of Mary as Saint Joachim did on hearing it heralded by an angel while sheltering among Jewish shepherds.

==Winter traditions==

===Krampus===
The word &quot;Krampus&quot; originates from the Old High German word for claw (&quot;Krampen&quot;). In the Alpine regions, the Krampus is a mythical horned figure represented as accompanying Saint Nicholas. Krampus acts as an anti–Saint Nicholas, who, instead of giving gifts to good children, gives warnings and punishments to the bad children. Traditionally, young men dress up as the Krampus in the first two weeks of December, particularly in the evening of December 5, and roam the streets frightening children and women with rusty chains, hammers and bells. This figure is believed to originate from stories of house spirits such as kobolds or elves.

===Perchten===

Originally, the word &quot;Perchten&quot; (plural of &quot;Perchta&quot;) referred to the female masks representing the entourage of an ancient goddess, &quot;Frau Perchta&quot;, or &quot;Pehta Baba&quot; as it is known in Slovenia. Some claim a connection to the Nordic goddess Freyja, though this is uncertain. Traditionally, the masks were displayed in processions (&quot;Perchtenlauf&quot;) during the last week of December and first week of January, and particularly on January 6. The costume consists of a brown wooden mask and brown or white sheep&#x27;s skin. In recent times Krampus and Perchten have increasingly been displayed in a single event, leading to a loss of distinction of the two. Perchten are associated with midwinter and the embodiment of fate and the souls of the dead. The name originates from the Old High German word &quot;peraht&quot; (&quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;bright&quot;).

Sometimes, &quot;der Teufel&quot; is viewed to be the most &quot;schiach&quot; (&quot;ugly&quot;) Percht (masculine singular of &quot;Perchten&quot;) and &quot;Frau Perchta&quot; to be the most &quot;schön&quot; (&quot;beautiful&quot;) Perchtin (female singular of &quot;Perchten&quot;).

==Spring traditions==
Chalandamarz is an ancient festival celebrated by the Romansh speaking part of the Swiss Canton Graubünden. It is celebrated on the first of March and marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring. Its object is to scare away the evil spirits of winter and wake up the good spirits of spring.

== Badalisc ==

The Badalisc is a &quot;good&quot; mythological animal who lives in the woods of Andrista, in Val Camonica, Italy. During an annual town festival someone dresses up as the creature and is &quot;captured&quot; and brought to the town. The animal is made to tell the people of the town gossip. At the end of the festival the creature is released until the next year&#x27;s ceremony.

<doc id="1083916" wikidata="Q16420820" url="?curid=1083916" title="Bertha">
<text>Bertha is a female Germanic name, from Old High German &quot;berhta&quot; meaning &quot;bright one&quot;. It was usually a short form of Anglo Saxon names &quot;Beorhtgifu&quot; meaning &quot;bright gift&quot; or &quot;Beorhtwynn&quot; meaning &quot;bright joy&quot;. 

The name occurs as a theonym, surviving as Berchta, a figure in Alpine folklore connected to the Wild Hunt, probably an epithet of &quot;*Frijjō&quot; in origin.

&quot;Bertha&quot; appears as a Frankish given name from as early as the 6th century.
The monothematic &quot;Bertha&quot; as a given name may, however, not originate with the theonym but rather as a short form of dithematic given names including the &quot;bright&quot; element. 
This is notably the case with the mother of Charlemagne, Bertrada (properly &quot;berht-rada&quot; &quot;bright counsel&quot;) called &quot;Bertha Broadfoot.&quot; Carolingian uses of the name &quot;Bertha&quot;, as in the case of Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne and Bertha, daughter of Lothair II, are in this tradition.

In modern times, the name is associated with an unusually large example of a class of objects. Many large machines are nicknamed Bertha for the World War I howitzer known as Big Bertha.

<doc id="1083920" wikidata="Q192828" url="?curid=1083920" title="Angola national football team">
<text>The Angola national football team () represents Angola in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Angolan Football Federation. Nicknamed &quot;Palancas Negras&quot; (Black Sable antelopes), the team is a member of both FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

Angola reached its highest FIFA ranking of 45th in July 2000. Their greatest accomplishment was qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, their only World Cup to date.

==History==
Angola played their first game against Congo on 8 February 1976, losing 3–2. On 26 June 1977, Cuba became Angola&#x27;s first non-African opponent when the two countries met in Angola, with Angola winning 1–0. Angola entered World Cup qualifying for the first time in the 1986 qualifying competition. Angola defeated Senegal on penalties in the first round before narrowly losing to Algeria 3–2 on aggregate in the second round.

Angola qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 1996. They were drawn in Group A with South Africa, Egypt and Cameroon. They lost their first two games to Egypt and South Africa, but managed a 3–3 draw against Cameroon. They finished bottom of the group and did not reach the second round. Angola then qualified for their second successive African Cup of Nations in 1998, but again failed to reach the second round, drawing 0–0 with South Africa and 3–3 with Namibia, and losing 5–2 to Ivory Coast.

After missing the last 3 tournaments, they qualified for the 2006 African Nations Cup. They recorded their first African Cup of Nations win against Togo, winning 3–2, two goals coming from Flávio and the other coming from Maurito. They also drew 0–0 against Congo DR and lost 3–1 against Cameroon. Angola&#x27;s best performance then came in the 2008 African Nations Cup. They were drawn in Group D with Tunisia, South Africa and Senegal. They drew 1–1 and 0–0 with South Africa and Tunisia, then defeated Senegal 3–1, two goals coming from Manucho. In the quarter-finals they were beaten by eventual winners Egypt 2–1, but Manucho scored again, finishing with four goals in total.

Angola also won the COSAFA Cup in 1999, 2001 and 2004.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
Angola qualified for the 2006 World Cup after only losing one game in the qualifiers ahead of favourites Nigeria.

When picking the squad, Gonçalves sought advice from Chelsea manager José Mourinho, whose wife was born in Angola. Angola&#x27;s &quot;Golden Generation&quot; saw players like Akwá, João Ricardo, Paulo Figueiredo, Flávio Amado and Jamba selected to go to the World Cup. Angola played six warm-up games against South Korea, Mauritius, Lesotho, Argentina, Turkey and USA.

Angola played their first World Cup finals game against the Portuguese side, who won the match 1–0, the only goal coming from Pauleta. There was a very friendly environment in and around the stadium during this match because of the links and friendship between the countries of Angola and Portugal. Angola drew 0–0 in their second game with Mexico, and still had a chance of qualifying for the second round had they beaten Iran in their final group game, but the match finished 1–1 after goals by Flávio and Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh. Angola were eliminated from the tournament only losing one game.


===2010 World Cup failure===
After the 2006 World Cup, many of Angola&#x27;s most experienced players such as Akwá and João Ricardo retired from the international game, but the expectation was still high for the team to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The team had a bye through the first round of qualification and in the second round they were drawn in Group 3 along with Benin, Uganda and Niger. Despite winning their first two matches, Angola failed to proceed to the third round, missing out by two points.

===2010 Africa Cup of Nations===
As hosts of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, Angola were seeded in Group A along with Mali, Algeria, and Malawi. Coached by Manuel José, in their first game they drew 4–4 with Mali, after letting a 4–0 lead slip in the last 11 minutes (including three goals in stoppage time). They recovered from this by beating Malawi 2–0 in the second match, and topped the group by drawing 0–0 with Algeria. They were knocked out in the quarter final after a 1–0 defeat by eventual finalists Ghana.

<text>Mablethorpe is a seaside town in the civil parish of Mablethorpe and Sutton, in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 3,611. On 1 April 1974 the parish was changed to form &quot;Mablethorpe and Sutton&quot;. The population including nearby Sutton-on-Sea was 12,531 at the 2011 census and estimated at 12,633 in 2019.

The town was visited regularly by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a 19th-century Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Some town features have been named after him, such as Tennyson Road and the now closed Tennyson High School.

==History==
===Roman Empire===
A hoard of Roman treasure was found in Mablethorpe in the 1980s, as were a Roman brooch and pottery.

===Mablethorpe Hall===
Mablethorpe has existed as a town for many centuries, gaining its market town charter in 1253. Coastal erosion means some of it was lost to the sea in the 1540s. Records of the Fitzwilliam family of Mablethorpe Hall date back to the 14th century. In the 19th century, it was a centre for ship breaking in the winter. Mablethorpe Hall is to the west of the town along Alford Road near the Church of St Mary. The Mablethorpe church parish includes Trusthorpe.

===Town lifeboats===

Mablethorpe&#x27;s first lifeboatstation was built in 1883. It was closed temporarily in 1917 due to crew shortages in the First World War but the closure was made permanent in 1920. It reopened as an inshore lifeboat station in 1965. It operates two lifeboats, an and a smaller D-class.

===East Coast floods===
In 1953, Mablethorpe was hit by the disastrous East Coast floods. The seawall was breached on 31 January. A granite rock memorial was unveiled on the coast on 31 January 2013 on the 60th anniversary of the disaster, in memory of the town&#x27;s 42 victims.

===In literature===
Mablethorpe is the destination for the fictional Morel family&#x27;s first holiday in the still popular D. H. Lawrence novel, &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, published in 1913: &quot;At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as they wished for thirty shillings a week. There was immense jubilation. Paul was wild with joy for his mother&#x27;s sake. She would have a real holiday now. He and she sat at evening picturing what it would be like. Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty. There was wild rejoicing and anticipation. Paul told Miriam. She seemed to brood with joy over it. But the Morels&#x27; house rang with excitement.&quot;

Mablethorpe is the seaside setting for the Ted Lewis crime novel &quot;GBH&quot;, published in 1980. The novel was his last and has been described as a &quot;lost masterwork&quot;.

==Transport==
Mablethorpe and much of east Lincolnshire lost its rail service in 1970 to the Beeching Axe, despite its long history. The station site is now the town&#x27;s sports centre.

Stagecoach operate an hourly service to Skegness, as well as a service to Louth and Lincoln. Grayscroft Coaches operates several services from a base in Victoria Road. Brylaine runs a service between Mablethorpe and Alford and Spilsby, usually every two hours.

Lincolnshire County Council operates a demand-responsive CallConnect service linking remoter areas to connection points at Alford, Chapel St Leonards and Mablethorpe for mainline bus services.

==Geography==
Mablethorpe, in the East Lindsey council district, is administered with Sutton-on-Sea and Trusthorpe as the civil parish of Mablethorpe and Sutton. The original parish of Mablethorpe covers a rectangular area inland along Alford Road towards Maltby le Marsh, as far as Grange Leisure Park, where Earl&#x27;s Bridge crosses West Bank. The south of the former parish follows the Trusthorpe Drains, which are crossed at Bamber&#x27;s Bridge on &quot;Mile Lane&quot;. Out towards Alford lies &quot;Strubby Airfield&quot;, with the Strubby Aviation Club and Lincs Gliding Club. To the north is the large parish of Theddlethorpe St Helen, which extends to the River Great Eau at Saltfleetby. The town is the eastern terminus of the A52. The town is also accessed by the A1104 and A16 through Alford. The A157 heads west towards Louth and is said to be the &quot;sixth bendiest A-road in the UK&quot;.

== Demographics ==

At the 2021 census, Mablethorpe and Sutton had a population of 12,668.

==Commerce==
The town&#x27;s one retail bank branch, Barclays, closed in July 2019. There are four supermarkets – a Co-op (which also includes a branch of Boyes), Lidl and from October 2021 the very first Tesco opened its doors. &#x27;Lord Bros&#x27; an independent supermarket on Victoria Road has been open since the early 1960s. Branches of some high street chains are present, but most shops in Mablethorpe are independently operated. Market days vary through the year: Monday (Summer),Thursday (year round).
===Leisure===
Family attractions include a small fairground and an award-winning beach with traditional seaside amusement arcades and one of the largest family entertainment centers in England named The Mirage. One of Mablethorpe&#x27;s long-standing features, its sand train, takes visitors to and from the northern end of the beach. Mablethorpe Seal Sanctuary and Wildlife Centre is also north of the town.

A Time and Tide Bell installed on the beach near the Seal Sanctuary in 2019 is one of a series around the UK, rung by high tides.

Mablethorpe&#x27;s cinema, the &quot;Loewen&quot; in Quebec Road, was previously known as the &quot;Bijou&quot;. &quot;The Dunes&quot; leisure complex lies on Mablethorpe&#x27;s seafront. The seafront also gained a skatepark in 2008, which includes a small funbox, a spine and two quarter pipes.

Several small caravan parks and guest houses provide tourist accommodation.
==Electric power==
Just over a mile north-east of the town, near the Seal Sanctuary, was the now-closed Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal, which supplied 5 per cent of the UK&#x27;s gas. To the west is the Bambers wind farm, housing eight turbines and producing five MW of power since November 2004. An extension called Bambers II opened in November 2006 and produces an additional five MW of power. The two turbines of Mablethorpe wind farm, which produce 1.2 MW of power, were the first such in Lincolnshire when built in July 2002. All three wind farms are owned by Ecotricity and stand at the corner of West Bank and the Trusthorpe Drains. Mablethorpe&#x27;s &quot;Star of the East&quot; is on the seafront.

==Media==
The local weekly newspapers are the &quot;Mablethorpe Leader&quot; and &quot;The East Lindsey Target&quot;. 

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire &amp; That’s Tv Humber, Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter. 

Radio coverage for Mablethorpe is provided by BBC Radio Lincolnshire and Hits Radio Lincolnshire.

==Education==
The community&#x27;s primary school is Mablethorpe Primary Academy School. The Mablethorpe site of Monks&#x27; Dyke Tennyson College closed in August 2016.

==Events==

Mablethorpe hosts a unique beach-hut festival each September. Privately owned beach huts compete in outward design, amidst a backdrop of poetry, music, and drama.

Mablethorpe has long hosted motorbike sand racing each winter and spring. This has inspired the Lincolnshire Bike Week, following the Mablethorpe and Sutton-on-Sea Bike Nights.

Each summer Mablethorpe hosts an illuminations event (a &quot;switch on&quot;), for which a celebrity is invited. Those officiating have included Barbara Windsor, Timmy Mallett and Wolf and Hunter of &quot;Gladiators&quot;.

<text>Fresno Pacific University (FPU) is a private Christian university in Fresno, California, United States. It was founded as the Pacific Bible Institute in 1944 by the Pacific District Conference of U.S. Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches. The university awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965. The first master&#x27;s degree program was introduced in 1975.

==History==
At the time of its founding, Pacific Bible Institute was located in a large home at 1095 N. Van Ness Ave. There were five staff members and twenty-eight students. By the time the first school year was finished, a former YWCA building at the corner of Tuolumne and L streets (originally designed by Julia Morgan) had been purchased, and the next school year began in this building.

By 1958, land was purchased for the construction of the current campus near the corner of Butler and Chestnut, along with the Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary and the new Butler Avenue Mennonite Brethren Church. Construction began on a new classroom building that year, and two dormitory buildings one year later. The classroom building was ready for use in the fall of 1959, but the dorm buildings were not completed until 1961 because of financial difficulties.

The Bible Institute became an accredited junior college in 1961, and decided to develop a four-year program two years later, in 1963. In 1964, Pacific Bible Institute changed its name to Pacific College, and became accredited with the WASC the next year. By 1967, the decision was made to add graduate courses, and the accreditation for the first master of arts program was received from WASC in 1975. The college changed its name to Fresno Pacific College in 1976 and to Fresno Pacific University in 1997.

In 2010 the Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary became a part of the university, and changed its name to Fresno Pacific University Biblical Seminary.

The university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2015 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students. Same-sex sexual activity by students (as well as any heterosexual sexual activity outside of marriage) is a violation of university residential policies. In 2015 then-president Richard Kriegbaum stated that gay marriage was &quot;anti-Christian.&quot;

<doc id="1083950" wikidata="Q7157511" url="?curid=1083950" title="Peace camp">
<text>Peace camps are a form of physical protest camp that is focused on anti-war and anti-nuclear activity. They are set up outside military bases by members of the peace movement who oppose either the existence of the military bases themselves, the armaments held there, or the politics of those who control the bases. They began in the 1920s and became prominent in 1982 due to the worldwide publicity generated by the Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp. They were particularly a phenomenon of the United Kingdom in the 1980s where they were associated with sentiment against American imperialism but Peace Camps have existed at other times and places since the 1920s.

==Reasoning behind the protest==
In the United Kingdom, people came to live outside military bases at protest camps in order to witness their opposition to and nonviolently protest against the presence of nuclear weapons in Europe that were directed against the then Soviet Union by the United States, calling for nuclear disarmament. The women at Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp were particularly against the placing of US cruise missiles there, something they claimed made the area a direct target of Soviet Union aggression. During the 1980s the United States Air Force had land-based cruise missiles at several of the above locations, not only Greenham Common; they have since been moved back to the United States, though there remains a US military presence in the UK, and the UK continues to possess and develop nuclear weapons itself. Due to these factors the concept of the peace camp remains alive today; and because of the presence of Faslane Peace camp there has continuously been at least one peace camp outside a military base in the UK since 1982.

==History==

The first peace camps are known to have originated in the 1920s.

=== 1980s ===
The first modern peace camps were the various (initially mixed but later) women-only peace camps at the military base at Greenham Common, England, set up in 1981. Greenham Common Women&#x27;s Peace Camp maintained a presence at the camp until 2000. Women-only peace camps were based at Waddington, Lincs from April – September 1982 and Capenhurst October 1982 – March 1983. Other, mixed-sex, peace camps sprang up at the military bases of Upper Heyford, Daws Hill in High Wycombe, RAF Molesworth, Lakenheath, Naphill and Faslane. Faslane Peace Camp, which was established in 1982, is still in existence today. There has been a women&#x27;s peace camp at Aldermaston for one weekend a month since 1985 that continues to meet.

==== Naphill ====
A bunker was constructed for RAF Strike Command on National Trust land (Bradenham Village) near High Wycombe, England between 1983 and 1985. Naphill Peace camp was set up to witness and oppose this construction. &quot;The Angry Pacifist&quot; magazine was produced out of Naphill Peace camp.

==== White House Peace Vigil ====
Thomas and Concepcion Picciotto are founders of the longest running peace vigil in the US. The White House Peace Vigil has been located opposite the White House at Lafayette Square on the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. since June 3, 1981.

==== Brambles Farm, Waterlooville, Hampshire ====
The Brambles Farm Peace Camp was set up in 1982 on the site of a research and development facility for the production of the Spearfish 7525 torpedo for the Royal Navy. The camp, although anti-war and anti-nuclear in its beliefs, was also supported and attended by local people demonstrating against the loss of green space and the lack of public consultation. The protesters held up the construction work for a number of months and was visited by some 3,000 people from this country and abroad. A Torpedo Town festival was held in the area for a number of years afterwards, the largest in 1991 at Liphook in Hampshire when some 25,000 people danced to the Spiral Tribe sound system. These festivals fell foul of the rave party and free festival crackdown in the early 1990s by the Tory government.

==== Seneca County, New York ====
In 1983, feminists established the Seneca Women&#x27;s Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice in Romulus, New York, the site of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, to demand the abolition of nuclear weapons.

=== 21st century ===
In 2001 Brian Haw set up the Parliament Square Peace Campaign outside the Houses of Parliament in London. In August 2007 others who had joined him were evicted but he was allowed to stay.

A peace camp was set up at Fairford on 17 February 2003 in protest against the Iraq War.

In February 2005, peace activists and residents began a peace camp at the village of Daechuri, South Korea, in opposition to the expansion of Camp Humphreys, which declared autonomy from Korea on February 7, 2006. As of October 2006, resisting residents remain on-site, despite demolition of homes owned by residents who have accepted compensation.

On May 13, 2005, protesters set up a peace camp on Drake&#x27;s Island, just off Plymouth.

In August 2005, Cindy Sheehan set up Camp Casey, a peace camp named after her son, outside the Texas ranch of United States President George W. Bush, through which she has attracted considerable media attention.

==Alternate usages of the term==
The term peace camp is primarily used for a form of anti-war protest camp particularly prevalent in the UK in the 1980s, however, it is also sometimes used to describe political factions before or during wartime that are opposed to a particular war. These are not a physical camps but political alliances. Currently, there is an Israeli peace camp.

In addition, the term is sometimes used for summer camps that bring together youth from different groups in conflict (e.g., Palestinian and Israeli youth) to work towards transformation and improvement of mutual relations. While the organizers of such camps clearly support peaceful solutions, participants may not do so or at least not to the same extent. In addition, these camps are not intended as a &quot;protest camp&quot;, but rather to constructively work towards their goals and bring about change in the participants, which are intended to serve as disseminators of peaceful attitudes in their home communities.

In the early 19th Century, &quot;Apaches de Paz&quot; or Apache peace camps were established for the purpose of religious conversion. They were established near presidios in the early 19th century by the Spanish in what is now Mexico and the southwestern United States. These were administrated by the Roman Catholic Church to convert the Apaches to Roman Catholicism and - in the eyes of the Spanish - gaining the salvation of the Apaches. Rations and farming supplies were also given out at the camps in an attempt to turn the Apaches into farmers.

<text>The ATG Javelin was an American small high-speed personal jet that was developed by the Aviation Technology Group (ATG) prior to its bankruptcy. Planned for FAA certification under 14 CFR part 23, the Javelin had a design resembling a fighter aircraft, an unusual concept for civilian jets. The Javelin MK-20 derivative, developed in cooperation between ATG and Israel Aerospace Industries, was expected to fill the jet trainer role for various air forces. The first prototype took flight on 30 September 2005, flown by retired Air Force 2nd Lt and test pilot Robert Fuschino.

ATG halted all further development on the Javelin in December 2007 after failing to get $200 million to finance further development. The company subsequently declared bankruptcy in 2008, ending the development of the Javelin.

Javelin design rights were bought by Rud Aero, a very small airplane manufacturer. They had partnered with another very small firm, Stavatti Aerospace to offer a variant of the Javelin for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s T-X program. This proved unsuccessful, with the Boeing-Saab T-7 Red Hawk being selected by the US Air Force on 27 September 2018.

<text>Rudolf Dreikurs (February 8, 1897, ViennaMay 25, 1972, Chicago) was an Austrian psychiatrist and educator who developed psychologist Alfred Adler&#x27;s system of individual psychology into a pragmatic method for understanding the purposes of reprehensible behaviour in children and for stimulating cooperative behaviour without punishment or reward.

He suggested that human misbehavior is the result of feeling a lack of belonging to one&#x27;s social group. When this happens the child acts from one of four &quot;mistaken goals&quot;: undue attention, power, revenge or avoidance (inadequacy). His overall goal was that students would learn to cooperate reasonably without being penalized or rewarded because they would feel that they are valuable contributors to the classroom.

In 1952, Dreikurs organized a group of followers of Adlerian Psychology to found the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology. He was an active leader in the organization until his death.

<doc id="1083981" wikidata="Q986508" url="?curid=1083981" title="Penápolis">
<text>Penápolis is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is of 63,757 inhabitants (IBGE/2020). The city has an area of 710.8 km².

==Historical formation==

The region was first populated by the &quot;Crowned Indians&quot; (or Kaingang or still Caingangue). The first presence of the Brazilian State in the region was, in the end of the 19th century, a military colony in the Salto do Avanhandava, that was nicknamed &quot;Banishment&quot;.

The Patrimony appeared in donated lands, in 1906, by the Farmer Eduardo Jose de Castilho, to the priests &quot;Capuchinhos&quot;. These and the enterprising colonel Manuel Bento de a Cruz had established the Patrimony of Santa Cruz of the Avanhandava, on 25 October 1908.

Immediately afterwards, on 2 December 1908, the patrimony became a new town.

The pioneers had found its biggest obstacles in the attacks of the Indians and the &quot;malaria&quot;. The Indians alone finally had been pacified with the action of colonel Candido Rondon.

==Administrative history==
On 17 November 1909, the patrimony was raised as a district, and became Vila de Pennapolis, in honour to the just-deceased president Afonso Pena. It became a city on 22 December 1913. It was raised to a judicial district on 10 October 1917. The installation of the judicial district occurred on 27 July 1918.

The original territory of the city of Penápolis was vast, going until the River Paraná, but much of it was reduced with its successive dismemberments in new cities.

==Economy==
At the beginning of its population boom, the forest, coffee, sugar cane, cattle industries, carriage and railroad transport were the base for the economy of the city. Later came the dairy industry. Currently it relies on alcohol-sugar agro-industry, an industrial district and a strong private educational sector.

==Cultural aspects==

Little remained of the previous culture of the Crowned Indians. The city was, however, enriched with other Brazilian and European traditions, since immigrants of several European countries established there. Migration from Minas Gerais also introduced traditions of that region, in the form of candies, cheeses, and in artisanal activities related to the sugar cane culture.

The beaches at the edge of Tietê River, along with the artificial lakes created by the Nova Avanhandava Power Plant are major tourist attractions.

Famous people born in Penápolis include: the Bishop of the Diocese of Duke of Caxias, Dom Mauro Morelli; the Bishop of the Armenian Church of São Paulo, Dom Vartan Waldir Boghossian; the actress Pepita Rodrigues and the composer and singer Francisco Gottardi (the Southerner), of the pair &quot;caipira&quot; Sulino &amp; Marrueiro and Sabrina Sato, daughter of Omar Rahal and Kika Sato. She participated on Big Brother and since then became a celebrity. Now she is part of the cast of Panico, a comedy show on TV and radio.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Transportation ==
Penápolis is served by Dr. Ramalho Franco State Airport.

<doc id="1083982" wikidata="Q1420475" url="?curid=1083982" title="Laser Doppler velocimetry">
<text>Laser Doppler velocimetry, also known as laser Doppler anemometry, is the technique of using the Doppler shift in a laser beam to measure the velocity in transparent or semi-transparent fluid flows or the linear or vibratory motion of opaque, reflecting surfaces. The measurement with laser Doppler anemometry is absolute and linear with velocity and requires no pre-calibration.
==Technology origin==
The development of the helium–neon laser (He-Ne) in 1962 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories provided the optics community with a continuous wave electromagnetic radiation source that was highly concentrated at a wavelength of 632.8 nanometers (nm) in the red portion of the visible spectrum. It was discovered that fluid flow measurements could be made using the Doppler effect on a He-Ne beam scattered by small polystyrene spheres in the fluid.

At the Research Laboratories of Brown Engineering Company (later Teledyne Brown Engineering), this phenomenon was used to develop the first laser Doppler flowmeter using heterodyne signal processing. This instrument became known as the laser Doppler velocimeter and the technique was called laser Doppler velocimetry. It is also referred to as laser Doppler anemometry.

Early laser Doppler velocimetry applications included measuring and mapping the exhaust from rocket engines with speeds up to 1000 m/s, as well as determining flow in a near-surface blood artery. Similar instruments were also developed for solid surface monitoring, with applications ranging from measuring product speeds in production lines of paper and steel mills to measuring vibration frequency and amplitude of surfaces.

==Operating principles==
In its simplest and most presently used form, laser Doppler velocimetry crosses two beams of collimated, monochromatic, and coherent laser light in the flow of the fluid being measured. The two beams are usually obtained by splitting a single beam, thus ensuring coherence between the two. Lasers with wavelengths in the visible spectrum (390–750 nm) are commonly used; these are typically He-Ne, Argon ion, or laser diode, allowing the beam path to be observed. A transmitting optics system focuses the beams to intersect at their waists (the focal point of a laser beam), where they interfere and generate a set of straight fringes. As particles (either naturally occurring or induced) entrained in the fluid pass through the fringes, they scatter light that is then collected by a receiving optics and focused on a photodetector (typically an avalanche photodiode).

The scattered light fluctuates in intensity, the frequency of which is equivalent to the Doppler shift between the incident and scattered light, and is thus proportional to the component of particle velocity which lies in the plane of two laser beams. If the sensor is aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction, the electrical signal from the photodetector will then be proportional to the full particle velocity. By combining three devices (e.g., He-Ne, Argon ion, and laser diode) with different wavelengths, all three flow velocity components can be simultaneously measured.

Another form of laser Doppler velocimetry, particularly used in early device developments, has a completely different approach akin to an interferometer. The sensor also splits the laser beam into two parts; one (the measurement beam) is focused into the flow and the second (the reference beam) passes outside the flow. A receiving optics provides a path that intersects the measurement beam, forming a small volume. Particles passing through this volume will scatter light from the measurement beam with a Doppler shift; a portion of this light is collected by the receiving optics and transferred to the photodetector. The reference beam is also sent to the photodetector where optical heterodyne detection produces an electrical signal proportional to the Doppler shift, by which the particle velocity component perpendicular to the plane of the beams can be determined.

The signal detection scheme of the instrument is using the principle of optical heterodyne detection. This principle is similar to other laser Doppler-based instruments such as laser Doppler vibrometer, or laser surface velocimeter. It is possible to apply digital techniques to the signal to obtain the velocity as a measured fraction of the speed-of-light, and therefore in one sense Laser Doppler velocimetry is a particularly fundamental measurement traceable to the S.I. system of measurement.

==Applications==
In the decades since the laser Doppler velocimetry was first introduced, there has been a wide variety of laser Doppler sensors developed and applied.

===Flow research===
Laser Doppler velocimetry is often chosen over other forms of flow measurement because the equipment can be outside of the flow being measured and therefore has no effect on the flow. Some typical applications include the following:
*Wind tunnel velocity experiments for testing aerodynamics of aircraft, missiles, cars, trucks, trains, and buildings and other structures
*Velocity measurements in water flows (research in general hydrodynamics, ship hull design, rotating machinery, pipe flows, channel flow, etc.)
*Fuel injection and spray research where there is a need to measure velocities inside engines or through nozzles
*Environmental research (combustion research, wave dynamics, coastal engineering, tidal modeling, river hydrology, etc.).
One disadvantage has been that laser Doppler velocimetry sensors are range-dependent; they have to be calibrated minutely and the distances where they measure has to be precisely defined. This distance restriction has recently been at least partially overcome with a new sensor that is range independent.

=== Automation ===
Laser Doppler velocimetry can be useful in automation, which includes the flow examples above. It can also be used to measure the speed of solid objects, like conveyor belts. This can be useful in situations where attaching a rotary encoder (or a different mechanical speed measurement device) to the conveyor belt is impossible or impractical.

===Medical applications===
Laser Doppler velocimetry is used in hemodynamics research as a technique to partially quantify blood flow in human tissues such as skin or the eye fundus. Within the clinical environment, the technology is often referred to as laser Doppler flowmetry; when images are made, it is referred to as laser Doppler imaging. The beam from a low-power laser (usually a laser diode) penetrates the skin sufficiently to be scattered with a Doppler shift by the red blood cells and return to be concentrated on a detector. These measurements are useful to monitor the effect of exercise, drug treatments, environmental, or physical manipulations on targeted micro-sized vascular areas.

The laser Doppler vibrometer is being used in clinical otology for the measurement of tympanic membrane (eardrum), malleus (hammer), and prosthesis head displacement in response to sound inputs of 80- to 100-dB sound-pressure level. It also has potential use in the operating room to perform measurements of prosthesis and stapes (stirrup) displacement.

===Navigation===
The Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology used in NASA&#x27;s Project Morpheus lunar lander to automatically find a safe landing place contains a lidar Doppler velocimeter that measures the vehicle&#x27;s altitude and velocity. The AGM-129 ACM cruise missile uses laser doppler velocimeter for precise terminal guidance.

===Calibration and measurement===
Laser Doppler velocimetry is used in the analysis of vibration of MEMS devices, often to compare the performance of devices such as accelerometers-on-a-chip with their theoretical (calculated) modes of vibration. As a specific example in which the unique features of Laser Doppler velocimetry are important, the measurement of velocity of a MEMS watt balance device has allowed greater accuracy in the measurement of small forces than previously possible, through directly measuring the ratio of this velocity to the speed of light. This is a fundamental, traceable measurement that now allows traceability of small forces to the S.I. System.

==History==
&quot;Peruíbe&quot; in the Tupi language (spoken by many Tupi tribes along the Brazilian coast in the 16th century) means &quot;river of the shark&quot;. Originally as the region of Mongaguá, Peruibe belonged to the Itanhaém territory that stretched from São Vicente to Cananéia, both Portuguese villages founded during the colonial times. As Mongagua (nowadays a city), Peruibe, as a municipality, was created back on 18 February 1959 for administrative convenience. Back in the 16th century, the region of Peruibe (and the one of Itanhaém) would have had a bad reputation since most Tupiniquim Indians living there were put into slavery by the Portuguese, working in sugarcane plantations around São Vicente Island. The Abarebebe as the Indigenous peoples called Father Leonardo Nunes, or &quot;the priest that flies&quot; – since he was seen frequently walking on foot all around the long beach between Itanhaem and Peruibe, was the one who fought against this practice that hurt so many Indian families. He even converted an Indian Chaser who was then killed by the Indians, dying as a martyr. It was there, on the rock of Abarebebe that the Jesuits (also Father Joseph of Anchieta) built the first church of that part of the coast, named Church of Saint John Baptist that served also as a school and refuge against the Indian attacks. The sacred objects were taken to Itanhaem when its first church was finished a little later.

Nowadays Peruibe is a modern city presenting many luxury boroughs and restaurants. The public interest for the city is rising since there is a nature reserve named Parque da Juréia (Jureia Natural Park), featuring pristine beaches (Prainha, Guarau, Parnapoa or Parnapuã, Juquiazinho, Desertinha, Carambore and Barra do Una), which is also a &quot;local caiçara&quot; (native) community of fishermen, sheltering also an immense diversity of flora and fauna. The city is surrounded by the Sea Mountain Range (&quot;Serra do Mar&quot;) the south end of which, near Barra do Una, is called the Juréia Massif.

==Tourism==
Peruíbe attracts many tourists throughout the year. In Peruibe there are two areas of tourist interest: urban and ecological. The principal urban attractions are the Tower of TV and Mirante (Torre de TV e Mirante), Ruins of the Abarebebe (Ruínas do Abarebebê), Flórida square (Praça Florida), New Commercial Center-Padre Anchieta Avenue (Centro Comercial Novo-Avenida Padre Anchieta), Old Commercial Center-region of the Estação (Centro Comercial Velho-Região da Estação), Ambrósio Baldin Square (Praça Ambrósio Baldin) and Portinho.

Ecological tourist spots include the Rio Preto Bridge (Ponte do Rio Preto), Costão Beach (Praia do Costão), Mountain range of the Itatins (Serra do Itatins), Quarter of the Guaraú (Bairro do Guaraú), Guaraú River (Rio Guaraú), Guaraú Beach (Praia do Guaraú), Prainha, Bar of Una (Barra do Una), Una River (Rio Una) and Una Beach (Praia do Una).

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Sovetskaya Rossiya (, &quot;Soviet Russia&quot;) is a political newspaper in Russia. It kept its name after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and presently presents itself as a leftist independent newspaper. Its current editor is MP Valentin Chikin.

==History==
&quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; was first published on July 1, 1956. On January 1, 1974, it became the official press organ of the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR. The newspaper was published six times a week; in 1975, its circulation was 2,700,000 copies. In 2007, the circulation was 300.000, the newspaper is published three times a week.

==Political tendency==
The newspaper has friendly ties with the Communist Party. During the time of the Soviet Union, &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; was known for its opposition to Mikhail Gorbachev and support for neo-Stalinism. Notably, it published &quot;A Word to the People&quot;, a letter signed by, among others, three of the Gang of Eight who participated in the August Coup against others. It also published &quot;I Cannot Forsake My Principles&quot;, an infamous Stalinist critique of Gorbachev.

==Rossiya Tournament==
The newspaper arranged the Rossiya Tournament, an international bandy competition held every other year in Russia in 1972-1990. This tournament lived on for another two decades, but from 1992 it was called the Russian Government Cup and was arranged by the Russian government instead.

<doc id="1084026" wikidata="Q2327432" url="?curid=1084026" title="Christian humanism">
<text>Christian humanism regards classical humanist principles such as universal human dignity, individual freedom, and the importance of happiness as essential and principal or even exclusive components of the teachings of Jesus.

Proponents of the term trace the concept to the Renaissance, linking their beliefs to the scholarly movement and worldview often called just humanism.

==Terminology==
Historian Margaret Mann Phillips wrote that the basis of Christian humanism was &quot;the belief that all that is good comes from God, and the pre-Christian ages were inspired by Holy Spirit for his own purposes.&quot;

In the Renaissance, the initial distinguishing factor between Christian humanism and other varieties of humanism was that Christian humanists not only discussed religious or theological issues in some or all of their works (as did all Renaissance humanists) but according to Charles Nauert,

made a connection between their humanistic teaching and scholarship on classical languages and literature, on the one hand, and on the other hand, their study of ancient Christianity, including the Bible and the Church Fathers... Even more important, they associated their scholarly work (classical as well as biblical and patristic) with a determination to bring about a spiritual renewal and institutional reform of Christian society. That connection between their scholarly efforts and their longing for spiritual and institutional renewal is the specific characteristic that distinguishes &quot;Christian humanists&quot; as a group from other humanists who just happened to be religious.

Modern theologians such as Jens Zimmerman make a case for the concept of Christian humanism as a cogent force throughout the history of Christianity. In Zimmerman&#x27;s account, Christian humanism as a tradition emerges from the Christian doctrine that God, in the person of Jesus, became human in order to redeem humanity, and from the further injunction for the participating human collective (the church) to act out the life of Christ.

The term has been criticized by figures associated with the modern secular humanist movement, with some noting that it lacks coherence, or is in fact used to argue for the &quot;exceptionalism&quot; of Christianity.

Some modern Christian humanists, for example, go so far as to suggest that other understandings of humanism are inauthentic, saying that, &quot;common humanity, universal reason, freedom, personhood, human rights, human emancipation and progress, and indeed the very notion of secularity... are literally unthinkable without their Christian humanistic roots.&quot;

==History==

===Renaissance===

Scholars since the 18th century have agreed that some sort of change took place in Western European civilization in the period from 1300 to 1600. However, the extent and nature of this change have been widely debated. Some have seen the period as one in which a radically new sense of the world and humanity emerged, whereas others have seen instead the gradual development of ideas that had long been current. Nevertheless, there are elements in Renaissance thought that recur frequently in comparison to earlier centuries. In the Middle Ages, people typically yielded some of their identity to corporations—the church, the state, the feudal society, the guild, the university, and the monastic order. With the Renaissance came an increased sense of individuality and a celebration of uniqueness and individual self-determination. The literature of the period is filled with statements such as the following about the dignity, excellence, rationality, and power of individual human beings:

* Human beings are made &quot;in the image of God&quot;, meaning that each one has the possibility of being a person of creativity and moral excellence.
* Human beings are free; we are not enslaved by sin or psychological obstructions; we are able to set our own course, determine our own destiny.
* Human beings are actors on the human scene; we are creators, second only to God; we are the God-appointed governors of the world.
* Human beings have immortal souls, which is God&#x27;s way of verifying the preciousness of humankind.
* Human beings may achieve fame—the personal glory attained by an individual who thrusts himself or herself forward in some important, heroic, or prominent way.
Renaissance humanism is linked to those who, following Pico della Mirandola, emphasized the dignity and potential of created humankind. And those, such as Petrarch and Thomas More, who believed the humanities could aid the precepts and study of divinity. And those such as Erasmus who also promoted human flourishing.

===Origins===
Christian humanism originated towards the end of the 15th century with the early work of figures such as Jakob Wimpfeling, John Colet, and Thomas More; it would go on to dominate much of the thought in the first half of the 16th century with the emergence of widely influential Renaissance and humanistic intellectual figures such as Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples and especially Erasmus, who would become the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance. These scholars committed much of their intellectual work to reforming the church and reviving spiritual life through humanist education, and were highly critical of the corruption they saw in the Church and ecclesiastical life. They would combine the greatest morals in the pre-Christian moral philosophers, such as Cicero and Seneca with Christian interpretations deriving from study of the Bible and Church Fathers. The Waldensians have been viewed as a humanistic synthesis of Christianity.

====Jakob Wimpfeling====

Although the first humanists did little to orient their intellectual work towards reforming the church and reviving spiritual life through humanist education, the first pioneering signs and practices of this idea emerged with Jakob Wimpfeling (1450–1528), a Renaissance humanist and theologian. Wimpfeling was very critical of ecclesiastical patronage and criticized the moral corruption of many clergymen; however, his timidity stopped him from converting his work from speech to action for fear of controversy. Although he loved reading many of the classics of the writings of classical antiquity, he feared introducing them to mainstream Christianity and sought to use the works of the Latin Church Fathers and a few Christian poets from the Late Roman Empire towards creating a new form of education that would provide church leaders educated in Christian religion, prominent Church authors and a few important classical writings and hence improve Christendom&#x27;s condition.

====John Colet====

John Colet (1467–1519) was another major figure in early Christian humanism, exerting more cultural influence than his older contemporary, Jakob Wimpfeling. Being attracted to Neoplatonic philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola and gaining an appreciation for humanistic methods of analyzing texts and developing detailed ideas and principles regarding them, he applied this humanistic method to the epistles of Paul the Apostle.

In 1505, he completed his doctorate in theology, and then became the Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. From there, he used his fortune to found near the cathedral St Paul&#x27;s School for boys. The school was humanistic, in its teaching of Latin, Greek and moral preparation of its students, as well as its recruitment of prominent humanists to recommend and compose new textbooks for it. The best Christian authors were taught, as well as a handful of pagan texts (predominantly Cicero and Virgil), however, Colet&#x27;s restrictions on the teaching of other classical texts was seen as anti-humanistic and quickly reverted by the school&#x27;s headmasters. After his death, the school at St. Paul&#x27;s become an influential humanistic institution. His notable convocation sermon urged his fellow priests to &quot;return to the God of love and peace&quot;.

====Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples====
Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples (1453–1536) was, alongside Erasmus, the first of the great Christian humanists to see the importance of integrating Christian learning, in both the patristics and biblical writings, with many of the best intellectual achievements of ancient civilizations and classical thought. He was educated in the University of Paris and began studying Greek under George Hermonymus due to his interest in contemporary cultural changes in Italy. He taught humanities as Paris and, among his earliest scholarly works, was writing an introduction to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. He would write many other works on Aristotle and promote the use of direct translations of Aristotle&#x27;s work from the original Greek rather than the medieval Latin translations that currently existed.

His focus then began to shift to the Greek Church Fathers whom he personally considered abler sources for the pedagogy of spiritual life than medieval scholasticism, and his goal became to help revive spiritual life in Europe, retiring in 1508 to focus on precisely this. He began publishing various Latin texts of biblical books such as the Psalms and Pauline epistles and was keen to study textual variations between surviving manuscripts. According to Nauert, these &quot;biblical publications constitute the first major manifestation of the Christian humanism that dominated not only French but also German, Netherlandish, and English humanistic thought through the first half of the sixteenth century&quot;.

====Erasmus====

Erasmus (1466–1536) was the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance and the most widely influential Christian humanist scholar in history, becoming the most famous scholar in Europe in his day. He believed that &quot;learning and scholarship were a powerful weapon both for the cultivation of personal piety and institutional church reform&quot;, which is called &quot;instrumentalism&quot;.

One of the defining components of his intellectual success was his mastery of Greek.

He had published his &quot;Handbook of a Christian Knight&quot; () in 1503, writing about his new intellectual direction, the (&#x27;Christ&#x27;s philosophy&#x27;). It became incredibly popular with 29 Latin editions between 1519–1523 and receiving translations into English, Dutch, German, French, and Spanish.

The popularity of Erasmus and his work was further amplified by the success of his literary works such as &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, published in 1511, and &quot;Colloquies&quot;, published in 1518. He also gained incredible success as a textual scholar, interpreting, translating and editing numerous texts of Greek and Roman classics, Church Fathers and the Bible. This textual success began when he discovered and published Lorenzo Valla&#x27;s &quot;Annotations on the New Testament&quot; in 1504–1505, and in a single year, in 1516, Erasmus published the first Greek edition of the New Testament, an edition of the works of the Roman philosopher Seneca, and a four-volume edition of St. Jerome&#x27;s letters. His satires and criticisms were widely popular and renowned for decades to come, and he succeeded in having &quot;truly and fully&quot; founded Christian humanism.

===Contemporary===
Literary critic Lee Oser has suggested that Christian humanism ended with Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope; however, it began again with G.K. Chesterton, T.S. Eliot and J.R.R. Tolkien.

Personalism, an intellectual stance that emphasizes the importance of human persons, has been treated as a modern name for the Christian humanism associated with Pope John Paul II and John Henry Newman.
Incarnational humanism is a type of Christian humanism which places central importance on the Incarnation, the belief that Jesus Christ was truly and fully human. In this context, divine revelation from God independent of the Incarnation is seen as untrustworthy precisely because it is exempt from the vagaries of human discourse.

Jens Zimmermann argues that &quot;God&#x27;s descent into human nature allows the humans ascent to the divine&quot;. &quot;If God speaks to us in the language of humanity, then we must interpret Gods speech as we interpret the language of humanity.&quot; Incarnational humanism asserts a unification of the secular and the sacred with the goal of a common humanity. This unification is fully realized in the participatory nature of Christian sacraments, particularly the Eucharist. The recognition of this goal requires a necessary difference between the church and the world, where both &quot;spheres are unified in their service of humanity&quot;. Critics suggest it is quite wrong to establish a separate theology of the incarnation, and that proponents tend to abstract Jesus from his life and message.

==Criticism==
Andrew Copson refers to Christian humanism as a &quot;hybrid term... which some from a Christian background have been attempting to put into currency&quot;. Copson argues that attempts to append religious adjectives such as Christian to the life stance of humanism are incoherent, saying these have &quot;led to a raft of claims from those identifying with other religious traditions – whether culturally or in convictions – that they too can claim a &#x27;humanism&#x27;. The suggestion that has followed – that &#x27;humanism&#x27; is something of which there are two types, &#x27;religious humanism&#x27; and &#x27;secular humanism&#x27;, has begun to seriously muddy the conceptual water.&quot;

<doc id="1084037" wikidata="Q321940" url="?curid=1084037" title="Dave Sime">
<text>David William Sime (; July 25, 1936 – January 12, 2016) was an American sprinter, multi-sport athlete at Duke University, and a pioneering ophthalmologist. He won a silver medal in the 100-meter dash (photo finish) at the 1960 Olympic Games, and held several sprint records during the late 1950s.

==Early life==
Sime was born on July 25, 1936, in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Evelyn and Charles Sime, neither of whom graduated from high school. He grew up in Fair Lawn and played football and baseball at Fair Lawn High School, but did not run track. He was a charter member of the Fair Lawn High School Athletics Hall of Fame.

Sime applied to the United States Military Academy at West Point, as his dream was to become a pilot, but discovered he was color blind and accepted a baseball scholarship to Duke University in North Carolina.

==Duke University==
Sime was a member of Duke&#x27;s baseball and track and field teams, and played football for a season in 1958 while a first-year medical school student. His beginnings in track were accidental: his 100-yard dash on an unmowed grass surface in baseball shoes was a rapid 9.8 seconds, and the coaches soon asked him to join the track team. Opting not to play freshman football, he had gone out for fall track to stay in shape for baseball. Sime hit over .400 as a freshman and had the intention continuing in baseball for coach Ace Parker, but his success during winter track changed that. Parker was a former multi-sport athlete and recognized the exceptional speed and Olympic potential; Sime focused on track in 1956, then split time between both sports in 1957.

Sime achieved his greatest collegiate victory as a 19-year-old sophomore at the Drake Relays in April 1956, where he was named the meet&#x27;s outstanding performer after setting a meet record in the 100-yard dash in 9.4 seconds; he handed Bobby Morrow of Abilene Christian his first loss in over thirty races in the 100, and was inducted into the Drake Relays Athlete Hall of Fame in 1959. Sime was named the ACC Athlete of the Year in 1956 for his accomplishments in track and baseball. Prior to the Olympic trials, he and Morrow appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1956.

Sime was selected by the Detroit Lions in the 29th round (341st overall) of the 1959 NFL draft, but he opted not to play football professionally and continued at medical school.

In 2010, Duke named him their most outstanding athlete of the 20th century.

==Olympics==

Sime was unable to make the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne at age twenty due to a leg injury in his first attempt to ride a horse. Four years later (and midway through medical school), he competed in Rome and won a silver medal in the 100 meters, edged out by Armin Hary of Germany in a photo finish.

Sime anchored the U.S. to an apparent victory in the 4 × 100 m relay, posting a world record time of 39.4 seconds. The team was disqualified because at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box. During his career, he held world records at 100 yards, 220 yards, and the 220 yd low hurdles.

During the Rome Olympics, Sime worked with the CIA trying to entice Soviet long-jumper Igor Ter-Ovanesyan to defect; the attempt failed.

==Ophthalmology==
Sime never played sports professionally. He graduated in the top 10% of his class at the Duke University School of Medicine. He then practiced medicine as an ophthalmologist in Florida, where he was a pioneer in intraocular lens implants.

==Personal life==
Sime&#x27;s eldest child, Sherrie, went to the University of Virginia, where she was the school&#x27;s top-ranked singles tennis player. His son Scott was a state wrestling champion and all-state football player at Coral Gables Senior High School before going on to his father&#x27;s alma mater at Duke, where he was a starting fullback.

Sime&#x27;s youngest child, Lisa, attended Stanford University, where she was a standout soccer player. There she met her future husband, Ed McCaffrey, a Cardinal wide receiver who went on to win three Super Bowls and a Pro Bowl during a 13-year NFL career. Three of their first four sons (his grandsons): Max, Christian, and Luke McCaffrey, are an American football coach and a former NFL wide receiver, an NFL running back, and an NFL wide receiver, respectively.

After a lengthy battle with cancer, Sime died at age 79 in 2016.

<text>Our Lady of the Pillar () is the name given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the context of the traditional belief that Mary, while living in Jerusalem, supernaturally appeared to the Apostle James the Greater in AD 40 while he was preaching in what is now Spain. Those who adhere to this belief consider this appearance to be the only recorded instance of Mary exhibiting the mystical phenomenon of bilocation. Among Catholics, it is also considered the first Marian apparition, and unique because it happened while Mary was still living on Earth.

This title is also associated with a wooden image commemorating the apparition, which is now enshrined at the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. Pope Callixtus III granted indulgences for visitors to the shrine in 1456. Pope Innocent XIII in 1730 mandated her veneration throughout the Spanish Empire. On 20 May 1905, Pope Pius X granted the image a canonical coronation.

Our Lady of the Pillar is considered the Patroness of Aragon and its capital Zaragoza, Hispanic people, the Hispanic world, and of the Spanish Civil Guard. Her feast day is 12 October, which coincides with the National Day of Spain.

==History==

===Early tradition===


Catholic tradition holds that, in the early days of Christianity, the Apostles of Jesus spread the Gospel throughout the known world, with James the Greater evangelizing in Roman Hispania (modern-day Spain). He confronted great difficulties in his missionary efforts and faced severe discouragement. In AD 40, while he was praying by the banks of the Ebro at Caesaraugusta (Zaragoza), Mary bilocated from Jerusalem, where she was living at the time, and appeared to James, accompanied by thousands of angels, to console and encourage him.

Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of Marian devotion in Zaragoza is found in Christian tombs dating from the Roman period, which appear to bear images representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. In the 4th century, the presence of votive images placed on columns or pillars is attested. The oldest written testimony of devotion to the Blessed Virgin in Zaragoza is usually identified as that of Pedro Librana in 1155. There is evidence that the site attracted pilgrims from across the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th century, e.g. reflected in the work &quot;Milagros de Nuestra Señora&quot; by Gonzalo de Berceo, dated to the 1250s or early 1260s. The appellation &quot;Santa María del Pilar&quot; is attested for 1299. The claim that the first church had been the oldest in Hispania, built in AD 40 by James the Greater, is first recorded in 1318.

A book by Michael O&#x27;Neil (2015) called Exploring the Miraculous indicates that there are various traditions about earliest approvals by the church of this Marian apparition. From his book:

&quot;For example, one of the great pilgrimage sites in Spain, Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, originating in a miracle and housing an ancient jasper Marian image on a column, did not always recognize Our Lady under this title. According to the legend relating to the apostle St. James the Greater and his travels in Spain, on January 2 in the year 40, he was disheartened with his lack of success in proclaiming the gospel in Caesaraugusta (present-day Zaragoza) by the river Ebro, when he saw Mary (still alive at the time) miraculously appear on a pillar, comforting him and calling him to return to Jerusalem. The first written mention of the Virgin of Zaragoza comes from a bishop in the middle of the twelfth century, and Zaragoza’s co-cathedral’s name did not originally include a reference to El Pilar, being called Santa Maria Mayor. In 1296, Pope Boniface VIII conferred an indulgence on pilgrims visiting this shrine but still without mention of Our Lady of the Pillar. One of the legal councils of Zaragoza first wrote about Our Lady under this title in 1299, promising safety and privileges to pilgrims who came to visit the shrine. In 1456, Pope Calixtus III issued a bull encouraging pilgrimage to Our Lady of the Pillar and confirming the name and the miraculous origin. So, despite the lack of early extant texts about the miracle story and the name of this devotion, the enduring tradition delivers the story to us today.&quot; 

In other interpretations, the tradition of the Marian apparition can be traced to the 15th century: In either 1434 or 1435, a fire destroyed the alabaster altarpiece. The replacement altarpiece features bas-relief representations of the Marian apparition. The image of the Virgen del Pilar venerated today also dates to this period. It executed in the late Gothic style of Juan de la Huerta.

Pope Calixtus III in a bull issued on 23 September 1456 declares a seven-year indulgence for those who visit Our Lady of Saragossa. The text of the bull specifically mentions a pillar, for the first time suggesting the existence of an image known as &quot;Our Lady of the Pillar&quot;.
The feast day of 12 October was officially introduced by the Council of Zaragoza in 1640.

According to the account by María de Ágreda (d. 1665) in her &quot;Mystical City of God&quot;, Mary, mother of Jesus, was transported from Jerusalem to Hispania during the night, on a cloud carried by angels. During the journey, the angels also built a pillar of marble, and a miniature image of Mary with the Child Jesus.

===Approval===
The apparition of Our Lady of the Pillar was accepted as canonical by Pope Innocent XIII in 1723. So many contradictions had arisen concerning the miraculous origin of the church that Spain appealed to Innocent XIII to settle the controversy. After careful investigation, the twelve cardinals, in whose hands the affair rested, adopted the following account, which was approved by the Sacred Congregation of Rites on 7 August 1723, and later inserted in the lessons of the office of the feast of our Lady of the Pillar, celebrated on 12 October:

James returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a martyr, beheaded in AD 44 during the reign of Herod Agrippa. His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain. The year AD 40 is the earliest recognised Marian apparition in the Catholic Church, dating to a time when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was still alive. 
Pope Clement XII allowed the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar all over the Spanish Empire in 1730. Since the feast day (12 October) coincides with the discovery of the Americas (12 October 1492), Mary was later named as Patroness of the Hispanic World under this title.

==Image==
===Zaragoza===
A fire in 1434 burned down the church that preceded the present basilica.
The construction of the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, Zaragoza was started in 1681 and ended in 1711. 
The wooden statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is in the Late Gothic style. It stands tall, on a pillar of jasper with a height of .
The statue depicts Mary with the Child Jesus on her left arm, who has a dove sitting on his left palm.

Some reports state that an earlier wooden image was destroyed when the church burned down in 1434, consistent with an attribution of the current image to Juan de la Huerta (d. 1462) or his school.

It appears that folk belief in some cases may be inclined to regard the Saragossa image as miraculous, sculptured by the angels as they transported Mary from Jerusalem to Saragossa (Zaragoza); this mystical tradition goes back to María de Ágreda (d. 1665), herself the object of frequent &quot;mystical bilocation&quot; (i.e. she reported that she was often &quot;transported by the aid of the angels&quot; ), who gave an account to this effect in her &quot;Mystical City of God&quot;; however, unlike the tradition of the Marian apparition itself, the miraculous origin of the image is not part of the tradition recognized by the Holy See as canonical.

Since the 16th century, the pillar is usually draped in a skirt-like cover called &quot;manto&quot; &quot;mantle&quot;.
As a whole, it is protected by a bronze case and then another case of silver.
The image was canonically crowned in 1905 during the reign of Pope Pius X. The crown was designed by the Marquis of Griñi, valued at 450,000 pesetas (c. US$2.6 million as of 2017).

===Other depictions===
&quot;Our Lady of the Pillar&quot; is a common motif of the Madonna and Child in Spanish art; extant examples other than the Saragossa image date from the Renaissance period onward. Depictions become especially numerous following the introduction of the feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730.

==Feast day==


The feast of Our Lady of the Pillar is celebrated on 12 October and she is the Patroness of the Hispanic peoples and the Spanish Civil Guard. A grand nine-day festival known as &quot;Fiestas del Pilar&quot; is celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza) every year in her honour. The modern &quot;Fiestas del Pilar&quot;, as they developed since the 19th century, begin on the weekend preceding 12 October and they end on the Sunday after 12 October (i.e. they move between 5–13 and 11–19 October). They were declared as a &quot;national holiday of touristic interest&quot; (&quot;Fiesta de Interés Turístico Nacional&quot;) by the &quot;Ministerio de Comercio y Turismo&quot; in 1980.

As 12 October coincides with the day of the year 1492 when land was first sighted on Columbus&#x27;s First Voyage, the &quot;Fiesta de la Raza Española&quot;, first proposed in 1913 by Faustino Rodríguez-San Pedro y Díaz-Argüelles to fall on the same date. In the United States, this was later called &quot;Columbus Day&quot;, as Columbus tends to be more associated with Italy and Italian-Americans, rather than the Spanish and Latin America in the U.S. 
The &quot;Fiesta de la Raza Española&quot; was declared the national holiday of Spain in a decree by Antonio Maura and king Alfonso XIII
of 1918. The alternative name &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; was proposed in the late 1920s by Ramiro de Maeztu, based on a suggestion by Zacarías de Vizcarra.
After the Civil War, on 12 October 1939, the &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; was celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza), presided by Francisco Franco, with a special devotion to the &quot;Virgen del Pilar&quot;. Chilean foreign vice-secretary Germán Vergara Donoso commented that the &quot;profound significance of the celebration was the intimate inter-penetration of the homage to the Race and the devotion to Our Lady of the Pillar, i.e. the symbol of the ever more extensive union between America and Spain.&quot;
The name of &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; was introduced as the official name of the national holiday in a decree of 9 January 1958.
During the transition to democracy, there was a proposal to shift the national day to 6 December, the day of adoption of the Constitution, but in the end, in a decree of 1982, the day of 12 October was retained, under the name of &quot;Fiesta Nacional de España y Día de la Hispanidad&quot;. In 1987, the name was reduced to just &quot;Día de la Fiesta Nacional de España&quot;.
