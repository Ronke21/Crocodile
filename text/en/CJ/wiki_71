<text>Jeffrey B. Fager (born December 10, 1954) is an American television producer who is the former chairman of CBS News and former executive producer of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

==Biography==
Fager was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts, to an Episcopalian family, the son of Margaret (née Bulkley) and Charles Anthony Fager. He graduated from Colgate University in 1977. He began his career in broadcast news in Boston and joined CBS News in 1982 from San Francisco, California, CBS affiliate KPIX-TV, where he was a broadcast producer.

Fager was Executive Producer of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; from 1996 to 1998 and held senior and field producer positions for that and other CBS News programs, including &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; He left the &quot;Evening News&quot; in 1998 to become the first executive producer of &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;. In June 2004, he assumed the position of Executive Producer of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In February 2011, it was announced that Fager would lead the news division of CBS as Chairman of CBS News, a newly created position. In tandem with the newly appointed president, David Rhodes, Fager would head CBS News while continuing to executive produce &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

After stepping in as Chairman of CBS News, Fager said he would &quot;restore CBS News to where it should be, where it needs to be&quot;, using the original reporting and storytelling of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; as a benchmark for its other news programs.

On January 1, 2015, Fager stepped down as chairman but continued in his executive producer role of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; until his 2018 departure from CBS News. David Rhodes continued to serve as President of the CBS News Division.

==Personal life==
Fager is married to Melinda Wooster; they live in New Canaan, Connecticut, with their three children.

==Termination for harassment==
In 2018, nineteen current and former CBS employees told &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Fager allowed harassment in the news division. Six former employees also told the magazine that while inebriated at company parties, he touched employees in ways that made them uncomfortable.

Fager was ousted from CBS News on September 12, 2018. CBS News reported that Fager had sent a threatening text message to Jericka Duncan, one of the network&#x27;s correspondents, when she sought his response to the report in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The text read &quot;Be careful, There are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me, and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up, that will become a serious problem.&quot;

<doc id="1105518" wikidata="Q1911710" url="?curid=1105518" title="Maury Maverick">
<text>Fontaine Maury Maverick Sr. (October 23, 1895 – June 7, 1954) was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas, representing the 20th district from January 3, 1935, to January 3, 1939. He is best remembered for his independence from the party and for coining the term &quot;gobbledygook&quot; for obscure and euphemistic bureaucratic language.

== Background ==
Maverick was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Albert and Jane Lewis (Maury) Maverick. His paternal grandparents were Samuel Maverick, one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence and the source of the word , and Mary Ann Adams Maverick. He studied at Texas Military Institute, the Virginia Military Institute, and the University of Texas. Maverick&#x27;s ancestor is Samuel Maverick (colonist), who is one of the earliest settlers of Massachusetts, one of the largest original land owners, and the first to bring slaves to Massachusetts.

==Career==
===Early years===
Maverick was admitted to the bar in 1916 and practiced law in San Antonio. He was a first lieutenant in the infantry in World War I and earned the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. He served with the 28th Infantry Regiment, part of the 1st Division, and was involved in the Meuse–Argonne offensive.

In the 1920s, he was involved in the lumber and mortgage businesses.

===Government service===
From 1929 to 1931, he was the elected tax collector for Bexar County.

He was elected to the Seventy-fourth Congress in 1934, with support from the Hispanic population of his district, and re-elected in 1936 to the Seventy-fifth. During his 1934 campaign, Maverick enlisted Lyndon Johnson, a then little-known congressional secretary, to work for him during the Democratic primary. In the House, he was an ardent champion of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. He angered the conservative Democrats running the party back in Texas, including John Nance Garner.

Maverick was the sole Texas Democrat to vote for the Anti-Lynching Bill of 1937.

A split between FDR and Vice president John Nance Garner over Supreme Court reorganization put Congressman Maverick in an extremely weakened position, leaving him unable to fund his reelection, which lead to his defeat in the primary for a third term in 1938. This was primally accomplished at the direction of Garner&#x27;s reactionary Conservative allies in the district. Maverick returned to Texas where he was elected Mayor of San Antonio, again with support from minority voters, serving from 1939 to 1941, when he was labeled a Communist and defeated. Future president Johnson was running for senate and secretly made a pact with Maverick enemies: Johnson would help defeat Maverick if Maverick&#x27;s enemies would back Johnson for senate. During World War II, he worked for the Office of Price Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, and served on the War Production Board and the Smaller War Plants Corporation.

While serving at the Smaller War Plants Corporation he sent a message to his staff telling themMemoranda should be as short as clearness will allow... Put the subject matter--the point--and even the conclusion in the opening paragraph and the whole story on one page... Stay off the gobbledygook language. It only fouls people up...

===Later years===

After the war, he practiced law in San Antonio.

==Personal and death==

Maverick was a cousin of congressmen Abram Poindexter Maury and John W. Fishburne of Virginia and nephew of congressman James Luther Slayden of Texas, who married Ellen (Maury) at a Maury home called &quot;Piedmont&quot; in Charlottesville, Virginia, now part of the University of Virginia. They are related to Matthew Fontaine Maury, Dabney Herndon Maury, and the early and prominent Fontaine, Dabney, Brooke, Minor, Mercer, Herndon, Slaughter, and Slayden families of Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas.

He married Terrell Louise Dobbs and had a daughter and a son, San Antonio newspaper editorialist Maury Maverick, Jr. (who died in 2003 at the age of 82).

Maverick died on June 7, 1954. His widow later married the distinguished Texas author and historian Walter Prescott Webb.

<text>Battersea was a railway station on the West London Extension Railway located on Battersea High Street in Battersea, south-west London. Built at the request of the parishioners of Battersea, it opened on 2 March 1863. To prevent overloading the embankment, it was built of wood, with brick pillars under the platforms and structures, but was laid with broad gauge track, because the WLER carried GWR trains. It closed on 14 September 1940 or 21 October 1940 after air raid damage during the Blitz of World War II.

The station was south of Battersea Railway Bridge, at the end of the now pedestrianised area of Battersea High Street by the junction with Simpson Street. It was demolished after closure and no remains are visible today. The site, and an access route from Gwynne Road, continue to remain the property of Network Rail, allowing for potential reconstruction should the need arise in future.

It should not be confused with another station originally opened as &quot;Battersea&quot; on 1 October 1860 (along with Victoria station), but was renamed on 1 July 1862 to &quot;Battersea Park&quot;, and located on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, adjacent to the pier on the south bank of the River Thames, next to Victoria Railway Bridge. It closed on 1 November 1870.

<text>Nepal Rashtrabadi Gorkha Parishad (Nepal Nationalist Gorkha Council), a pro-monarchy political party in Nepal. The party was founded in 1951 by members of the erstwhile Rana dynasty. The party was led by Bharat Shamsher JBR and MG Mrigendra Shamsher JBR.

In 1990, a group reorganized a party under the same name.

== History ==
The party was known as Gorkha Dal until 1952, when it was suppressed after an armed mob had attacked the residence of B.P. Koirala. According to Levi, the party was a far-right communal creation of the Ranas.

The party won 19 seats in the 1959 general elections and was the largest opposition in the House of Representatives.

Shamsher was arrested in the 1960 royal coup, but was released in the fall of 1961 after giving support to the King. He was able to travel abroad, visited the Rome session of the Socialist International and then went to India. In India he denounced the royal regime in Nepal and pledged cooperation with the Nepali Congress to overthrow it. A month later he announced the merger of the party with the Nepali Congress. The Gorkha Parishad leaders in Kathmandu did however condemn this action. The party later disappeared, and its leaders went either to the opposition Nepali Congress or to work in the Panchayat system.

<text>Ankerite, also known as &quot;brown spar&quot; () is a calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese carbonate mineral of the group of rhombohedral carbonates with the chemical formula . In composition it is closely related to dolomite, but differs from this in having magnesium replaced by varying amounts of iron(II) and manganese. It forms a series with dolomite and kutnohorite.

== Name and history ==
It was first recognized as a distinct species by Wilhelm von Haidinger in 1825, and named for Matthias Joseph Anker (1771–1843) of Styria, an Austrian mineralogist.

In 19th-century mineralogy, as well as in mining and among geologists, ankerite and its close analogues from the dolomite series were more often known by the capacious, expansive name of ″brown spar″. This is partly because this mineral is the extreme (with the highest content of divalent iron ions) member of the dolomite-ankerite isomorphic series, as a result of which dirty-brown varieties of dolomite, contaminated with impurities, could also be encountered under the name of &quot;brown spar&quot;.

== Properties ==
The crystallographic and physical characters resemble those of dolomite and siderite. The angle between the perfect rhombohedral cleavages is 73° 48′, the hardness is 3.5 to 4, and the specific gravity is 2.9 to 3.1. The color is white, grey or reddish to yellowish brown.

== Genesis ==
Ankerite occurs with siderite in metamorphosed ironstones and sedimentary banded iron formations. It also occurs in carbonatites. In sediments it occurs as authigenic, diagenetic minerals and as a product of hydrothermal deposition. It is one of the minerals of the dolomite-siderite series, to which the terms brown-spar, pearl-spar and bitter-spar have been historically loosely applied.

It has been found in Western Tasmania, in mines in Dundas, Tasmania.

<text>Have Quick (also HAVEQUICK, short HQ) is an ECM-resistant frequency-hopping system used to protect military aeronautical mobile (OR) radio traffic.

Since the end of World War II, U.S. and Allied military aircraft have used AM radios in the &quot;NATO harmonised 225–400 MHz UHF band&quot; (part of &quot;NATO B band&quot;) for short range air-to-air and ground-to-air communications. During development and the procurement of UHF radios, military planners did not require features to secure communications for aircraft and helicopters from jamming until the post-Vietnam War era. Progress in electronics in the 1970s reached a point where anyone with an inexpensive radio frequency scanner or receiver set could intercept military communications. Once the target frequencies were identified, radio frequency jamming could easily be employed to degrade or completely disable communications.

The Have Quick program was a response to this problem. Engineers recognized that newer aircraft radios already included all-channel frequency synthesizers along with keyboards and displays for data entry. The only other system requirements to achieve the desired anti-jam functionality were an accurate clock (for timed synchronization) and a microprocessor to add frequency hopping to existing radios.

Aircraft and ground radios that employ HAVE QUICK must be initialized with accurate &quot;time of day&quot; (TOD; usually from a GPS receiver), a &quot;word of the day&quot; (WOD), and a net identifier (providing mode selection and multiple networks to use the same word of the day). A word of the day is a transmission security variable that consists of six segments of six digits each. The word of the day is loaded into the radio or its control unit to key the HAVE QUICK system to the proper hopping pattern, rate, and dwell time. The word of the day, time of day and net identifier are input to a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator that controls the frequency changes.

HAVE QUICK is not an encryption system, though many HAVE QUICK radios can be used with encryption; e.g. the KY-58 VINSON system. HAVE QUICK is not compatible with SINCGARS, the VHF - FM radios used by ground forces, which operate in a different radio band and use a different frequency hopping method; however some newer radios support both.

== Particularities ==
* A national Air Force operates generally in a closed common user group. However, deviation to this regulation existed on German territory until 1990. E.g. the HQ-user of the German Air Force in the North of Germany, operational subordinated to &quot;2nd Allied Tactical Air Force&quot; used &quot;HQ net-group 1&quot;, whereas the southern units, subordinated to &quot;4th Allied Tactical Air Force&quot;, used &quot;HQ net-group 2&quot;.
* The co-ordination of HQ radio frequency channels in the &quot;NATO-harmonised UHF-band&quot;, the design of the so-called &quot;HQ hop-sets&quot;, is provided in NATO-Europe in responsibility of the &quot;NATO Allied Radio Frequency Agency (ARFA)&quot; in Brussels.
* For training and exercises, HQ operates in &quot;peacetime mode&quot; with limited frequency access. Four net-numbers may be used overlapping in net-group 1 and 2. However, in &quot;tactical operation mode&quot; this limitation might be lifted.
* Some HQ-features are compatible to encryption hardware; e.g. to the&quot; KY-58 VINSON-family&quot;.

== Utilization in the US and NATO ==
HAVE QUICK was well adopted, and as of 2007 is used on nearly all U.S. military and NATO aircraft. Improvements include HAVE QUICK II Phase 2, and a &quot;Second generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO&quot; called &quot;SATURN&quot;. The latter features more complex frequency hopping.

<text>Marine Association Football Club is an English football club based in Crosby, Merseyside. The club, which was founded in 1894, is a member of both the Liverpool County and Lancashire County Football Associations, and currently plays in the , the sixth tier of the English football league system.

Marine is also notable for having the longest-serving manager in postwar English football. Roly Howard occupied the post from 1972 to 2005 and oversaw a total of 1,975 games.

==History==
The club was formed in 1894 by a group of local businessmen and former college students. Marine takes its name from a hotel on the River Mersey sea front at Waterloo, seven miles to the north of Liverpool city centre, where the founders of the club met. Marine moved to its present ground, Rossett Park, in 1903.

Marine quickly won multiple titles in the I Zingari League and the Liverpool Combination. The club&#x27;s greatest success as an amateur team in this period culminated in an FA Amateur Cup Final appearance in 1931–32, where they lost 7–1 to Dulwich Hamlet in front of a crowd of 22,000 fans at the Boleyn Ground.

In 1935–36, the club moved to the all-professional Lancashire Combination and enjoyed limited success before moving to the Cheshire County League in 1969–70.

In 1972, Roly Howard was appointed first team manager. Over a 33-year period he completed 1,975 competitive games, before retiring at the end of the 2004–05 season. He was recognised by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the longest serving manager in world football as Marine enjoyed their most successful period, winning 30 trophies.

The club relinquished its amateur status and became professional in 1974. Following this, three Cheshire League Championships were won in five seasons before Marine progressed to the Northern Premier League in 1979–80, where they remained continuously until the end of the 2023–24 season. They were Champions twice in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons as well as finishing as runners-up on two occasions. Marine have also won the League Challenge Cup on four occasions in 1984–85, 1991–92, 2002–03 and 2015–16.

In 1999, the magazine &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; included a monthly feature on the club, sending Michael Hann to follow them for an entire season. In 2001, Marine were the subject of a six-part television series for Granada TV, titled &quot;Marine Lives&quot;. The series included footage of former player Jason McAteer returning to visit the club.

 Under the new management team of Alvin McDonald and assistant Peter Carroll, Marine qualified for the Northern Premier Division play-offs twice in succession (2005–06 and 2006–07), losing to the eventual winners each time. In the 2007–08 season, the club won the Liverpool Senior Cup. McDonald left the club partway through the 2008–09 season with players Kevin Lynch and Phil Brazier being appointed caretakers. At the end of the season, Lynch was appointed permanent manager with Brazier as his assistant.

Lynch departed the club at the end of the 2012–13 season to become first team coach at Chesterfield, and was replaced by Brazier. However, Brazier was sacked at the end of the following season with the club having narrowly avoided relegation.

Carl Macauley took over at the beginning of the 2014–15 season, but a poor run of form saw the club in the relegation zone, 11 points from safety, and he was sacked. Defender Sean Hessey was placed in temporary charge until the end of the season, and guided the club to a remarkable escape from relegation, with only one defeat in their final twelve games. The club were reprieved from relegation despite finishing in 21st place, due to having the highest average points per game of clubs in the highest relegation spots across the three equivalent divisions. This meant that the club continued to hold their record as the longest-serving members of the Northern Premier League. Hessey was confirmed as the club&#x27;s permanent manager prior to the end of the 2014–15 season.

In the 2015–16 season, Marine secured a 15th-place finish. There was a strong performance in the league cup, beating Glossop North End, Ramsbottom United and Workington to progress to the quarter-finals. A home draw saw Ossett Town narrowly beaten 1–0 before Colwyn Bay were drawn to visit Rossett Park in the semi-finals. Colwyn Bay were defeated 4–1 with Alan Burton, Andy Owens, James Foley and player-manager Sean Hessey getting on the score-sheet. This set up a final against Scarborough Athletic to be held at Throstle Nest, home of Farsley Celtic. Going 0–1 down in the 58th minute, it wasn&#x27;t until Hessey subbed himself on for Willis in the 80th minute that Marine looked dangerous, and Warren Bellew scored in the 87th minute. At 1–1, in the fourth minute of added time, that season&#x27;s highest club goalscorer Danny Mitchley curled in an effort from the edge of the box to win the game for Marine. This was the fourth time that Marine FC won the league cup, a record for this competition.

Towards the end of a dismal 2016–17 season. Hessey left the club and was replaced by Tommy Lawson. A mass walk-out of players didn&#x27;t help Lawson but he managed to assemble a squad at short notice. He then guided the club away from the relegation zone after 5 wins in 11 games. Marine finished in 18th place in the table.

The 2017–18 season was once again a disappointment with Marine finishing in 19th place in the table. However, the team reached the final of the Liverpool Senior Cup where 750 fans saw them beaten 4–0 at home to Prescot Cables. They also went on a good run in the FA Trophy beating Whitby Town and Atherton Collieries. They then saw off teams from the division above in FC United and Chorley before a first ever visit to Dover Athletic saw them lose 3–4 against the Conference National team.

In the 2018–19 season, after only five games Marine found themselves second from bottom of the league. A 2–0 defeat at home to Grantham Town on 1 September saw manager Tommy Lawson resign the following day. His assistant Ian Johnson was given temporary charge whilst the club looked for a replacement. On 13 September 2018, Marine announced the appointment of former Chester manager Neil Young. He was joined by Alan Morgan as assistant manager on 21 September 2018. Young started his tenure with a 1–0 defeat at Warrington Town on 15 September 2018. In 2019, Marine were relegated to the Northern Premier League Division One North West. It was the first relegation in their history, and followed 40 consecutive seasons at the highest level of the Northern Premier League.

In 2021, Marine reached the third round of the FA Cup, which they lost 5–0 to Tottenham Hotspur. With Marine 161 places below Tottenham, the gap between the two teams was the biggest in FA Cup history. The match raised over £300,000 for the club from the selling of 32,202 &quot;virtual tickets&quot; to fans of Tottenham and other clubs who wished to support Marine but were unable to attend the match due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the FA Cup run in the 2020/21 season, Marine opened the 1894 Bar and Bistro at their ground.

Marine finished 5th in the 2021/22 season. They played Workington in the playoff semi final which they won 3–2 after extra time and a Neil Kengni hat-trick. They then won the playoffs after coming from behind to beat Runcorn Linnets which earned them promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division. In the 2022/23 season Marine won the Liverpool Senior Cup beating Runcorn Linnets in the final at the DCBL Stadium 4–2 on penalties. The following year, Marine repeated their success in the Liverpool Senior Cup, and earned a second promotion in three years; being promoted to the National League North following a 2–1 victory away to Macclesfield F.C..

==FA Cup==
The club have twice reached the third round of the FA Cup.

In 1992–93 they lost 3–1 to Crewe Alexandra, and in 2020–21 they lost 5–0 to Tottenham Hotspur.

Marine have beaten three Football League clubs (Barnsley, Halifax Town, and Colchester United) in the competition.

==FA Trophy==

Marine have twice reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, in 1983–84 and 1991–92. Both times, they played a team from the Northwich area. On both occasions they drew away, 1–1 and 2–2 respectively, before losing at home.

In 1983–84, they lost 1–3 on aggregate to Northwich Victoria.

In 1991–92, they lost 3–6 on aggregate to Witton Albion.

==Northern Premier League Cup==

Marine have appeared in six finals, winning the cup a record four times.

Runners Up 1980–81, 3–4 vs Runcorn

Winners 1984–85 3–2, vs Goole Town

Runners Up 1985–86, 0–1 Hyde United

Winners 1991–92, 1–0 Frickley Athletic

Winners 2002–03, 3–0 (on aggregate) vs Gateshead

Winners 2015–16, 2–1 vs Scarborough Athletic

Marine have also been winners of 13 senior county cups.

==Stadium==
The club play at Rossett Park, located on College Road in Crosby. It is believed that the ground has been in use since at least 1884 when rugby union was played there. Marine have played at the ground since 1903, when they moved from their previous ground at Waterloo Park, Crosby. In 1949, Marine played host to Nigeria at Rossett Park - all but one of whom played without boots - with the visitors winning 5–2. The crowd was officially given as 4,000 with some considering it to be 6,000.

Between 2006 and 2015, the ground was known as the Arriva Stadium due to a sponsorship deal.

On 24 January 2011, the club announced plans to develop the Arriva Stadium. The outdated floodlights were replaced in the summer of 2012 with a new eco friendly four corner system. The 20m high masts have a total of 28 lamps and these generate in excess of 350 lux, which was the Football League lighting requirement at the time of installation. Further to these plans, the club planned to build a 130-seat covered stand at the Crosender Road end of the ground. The total cost of all the improvements was estimated at £150,000.

On 25 January 2014, the club announced a two-year ground share agreement with North West Counties Premier Division side A.F.C. Liverpool. This has now extended to the 2021–22 season.

In August 2015, Rossett Park was renamed the Marine Travel Arena as a result of a sponsorship deal with the club&#x27;s existing shirt sponsors, Marine Travel. The deal will continue until 2024.

On 3 May 2022, the club began to dig up the pitch to install a new 4G pitch, after delaying it from the previous summer. This again was funded with the income from the FA Cup run in the 20–21 season. This project was finalised on 12 July.

In May 2024, the club announced plans to build a new stadium, with a fundraising target of £5 million to enable this to happen. In December 2024, it was revealed that Marine had signed an option agreement on a plot of land for the new stadium, subject to planning and funding. In February 2025, the club revealed plans for a new 5,000 capacity stadium in Thornton.

==Colours and badge==
Marine&#x27;s traditional home colours are white shirts with black trim, worn with black shorts and socks.

The club badge is a black and white coat of arms similar to that of the town they are based in, Crosby

==Supporters==
The club had a supporters association known as the MSA (Marine Supporters Association) that was formed in the late 1980s. The supporters association raises funds for the club, arranges away coach travel to many games, and operates the club&#x27;s merchandise shop. The MSA was disbanded in November 2021.

The Crosender Way is an independent supporters group for Marine, named after the Crosender Road area of the stadium. Formed in January 2017, the group actively promotes the football club via social media. The group&#x27;s main objective is to attract and support fans at the club and to organise away travel for all supporters.

<text>Samyukta Prajatantra Party Nepal (, translation: United Democracy Party Nepal) was a political party in Nepal. The party was led by Kunwar Inderjit Singh.

== History ==
In October 1955, after his arrival from China, where he was in hiding after escaping from prison, Kunwar Inderjit Singh announced the formation of the United Democratic Party Nepal. The party was formed as a nationalist force that was an alternative to the parties that existed in the country.

On 26 July 1957, Dr. K.I. Singh was appointed as the prime minister by King Mahendra and told to form a coalition government. He failed to do so as other political parties distrusted him. He was sacked less than four months later by the king after he attempted to reform the palace secretariat.

The party contested the first general elections in 1959, winning 5 seats to the House of Representatives. Party founder and chairman, Dr. K.I. Singh did not win his seat in the election. He accused the Nepali Congress-led interim government of interfering in the elections and called for the king to declare the elections invalid. The party formed the United Front with Tanka Prasad Acharya&#x27;s Nepal Praja Parishad which had won two seats in the elections and the Prajatantrik Mahasabha led by Ranganath Sharma which had been unsuccessful in the elections. The United Front claimed to be the opposition to Nepali Congress-led government and said the opposition in the parliament, Nepal Rashtrabadi Gorkha Parishad was in Dr. K.I. Singh&#x27;s own word &quot;the same thing as the Congress&quot; The United Democratic Party also managed to convince the two parliamentarians from Acharya&#x27;s Nepal Praja Parishad to join the party. On 15 December 1960, King Mahendra dissolved the parliament and started his own direct rule, a move that Dr. K.I. Singh supported. All political parties were banned and the party-less Rastriya Panchayat served as the country&#x27;s legislature.

<doc id="1105551" wikidata="Q1208648" url="?curid=1105551" title="Diameter (protocol)">
<text>Diameter is an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocol for computer networks. It evolved from the earlier RADIUS protocol. It belongs to the application layer protocols in the Internet protocol suite.

&quot;Diameter Applications&quot; extend the base protocol by adding new commands and/or attributes, such as those for use with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).

== Comparison with RADIUS ==
The name is a play on words, derived from the RADIUS protocol, which is the predecessor (a diameter is twice the radius). Diameter is not directly backward compatible but provides an upgrade path for RADIUS. The main features provided by Diameter but lacking in RADIUS are:
* Support for SCTP
* Capability negotiation
* Application layer acknowledgements; Diameter defines failover methods and state machines (RFC 3539)
* Extensibility; new commands can be defined
* Aligned on 32 bit boundaries

Also:
Like RADIUS, it is intended to work in both local and roaming AAA situations.
It uses TCP or SCTP, unlike RADIUS which uses UDP.
Unlike RADIUS it includes no encryption but can be protected by transport-level security (IPSEC or TLS).
The base size of the AV identifier is 32 bit unlike RADIUS which uses 8 bit as the base AV identifier size.
Like RADIUS, it supports stateless as well as stateful modes.
Like RADIUS, it supports application-layer acknowledgment and defines failover.
Diameter is used for many different interfaces defined by the 3GPP standards, with each interface typically defining new commands and attributes.

== Applications ==
A &quot;Diameter Application&quot; is not a software application but is a protocol based on the Diameter base protocol defined in RFC 6733 (obsoletes RFC 3588) and RFC 7075. Each application is defined by an application identifier and can add new command codes and/or new mandatory AVPs (Attribute-Value Pair). Adding a new optional AVP does not require a new application.

Examples of Diameter applications:
* Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application (MobileIP, RFC 4004)
* Diameter Network Access Server Application (NASREQ, RFC 7155)(Obsoletes: RFC 4005)
* Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol Application (RFC 4072)
* Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA, RFC 8506])(Obsoletes: RFC 4006)
* Diameter Session Initiation Protocol Application (RFC 4740)
* Various applications in the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem
:: Both the HSS and the SLF communicate using the Diameter protocol.
(Generic Bootstrapping Architecture): Bootstrapping Server Function

== History ==
The Diameter protocol was initially developed by Pat R. Calhoun, Glen Zorn, and Ping Pan in 1998 to provide a framework for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) that could overcome the limitations of RADIUS. RADIUS had issues with reliability, scalability, security, and flexibility. RADIUS cannot deal effectively with remote access, IP mobility, and policy control. The Diameter protocol defines a policy protocol used by clients to perform Policy, AAA, and resource control. This allows a single server to handle policies for many services.

Like RADIUS, Diameter provides AAA functionality, but uses TCP and SCTP instead of UDP, therefore delegating detection and handling of communication problems to those protocols. The Diameter protocol is enhanced further by the development of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). The S6a, S6b, Gx, Gy, Sy, Rx, Cx, Dh, Dx, Rf, Ro, Sh and Zh interfaces are supported by Diameter applications. Through the use of extensions, the protocol was designed to be extensible to support proxies, brokers, strong security, mobile IP, network-access servers (NASREQ), accounting and resource management.

== Protocol description ==
The Diameter base protocol is defined by RFC 6733 (Obsoletes: RFC 3588 and RFC 5719) and defines the minimum requirements for an AAA protocol. &quot;Diameter Applications&quot; can extend the base protocol by adding new commands, attributes, or both. Diameter security is provided by IPsec or TLS. The IANA has assigned TCP and SCTP port number 3868 to Diameter, as stated in section 11.4 of RFC 6733.

=== Packet format ===
The packet consists of a Diameter header and a variable number of Attribute–Value Pairs, or AVPs, for encapsulating information relevant to the Diameter message.

=== Version ===
This field indicates the version of the Diameter Base Protocol. As of 2014, the only value supported is 1.

=== Message length ===
The Message Length field indicates the length of the Diameter message in bytes, including the header fields and the padded AVPs.

=== Command flags ===
The &quot;R&quot; (Request) bit – If set, the message is a request. If cleared, the message is an answer.

The &quot;P&quot; (Proxiable) bit – If set, the message MAY be proxied, relayed or redirected. If cleared, the message MUST be locally processed.

The &quot;E&quot; (Error) bit – If set, the message contains a protocol error, and the message will not conform to the CCF described for this command. Messages with the &quot;E&quot; bit set are commonly referred to as error messages. This bit MUST NOT be set in request messages.

The &quot;T&quot; (Potentially re-transmitted message) bit – This flag is set after a link failover procedure, to aid the removal of duplicate requests. It is set when resending requests not yet acknowledged as an indication of a possible duplicate due to a link failure.

=== Commands ===
Each command Request/Answer pair is assigned a command code. Whether it is the request or answer is identified via the &#x27;R&#x27; bit in the Command Flags field of the header.

The values 0-255 are reserved for RADIUS backward compatibility.
The values 256-16777213 are for permanent, standard commands allocated by IANA.
The values 16777214 and 16777215 (hex 0xFFFFFE and 0xFFFFFF) are reserved for experimental and testing purposes.

A Command Code is used to determine the action that is to be taken for a particular message. Some common Diameter commands defined in the protocol (base and applications) are:

=== Application-ID ===
Application-ID is used to identify for which Diameter application the message is applicable. The application can be an authentication application, an accounting application, or a vendor-specific application.

Diameter agents conforming to a certain Diameter extension publicize its support by including a specific value of in the Auth-Application-ID Attribute of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA) command.

The value of the Application-ID field in the header is the same as any relevant Application-ID AVPs contained in the message. For instance, the value of the Application-ID and of the Auth-Application-ID Attribute in the Credit-Control-Request (CCR) and Credit-Control-Answer (CCA) Command for the Diameter Credit-Control Application is 4.

=== Hop-by-Hop Identifier ===
The Hop-by-Hop Identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in network byte order) that is used to match the requests with their answers as the same value in the request is used in the response.

The Diameter protocol requires that relaying and proxying agents maintain transaction state, which is used for failover purposes. Transaction state implies that upon forwarding a request, its Hop-by-Hop Identifier is saved; the field is replaced with a locally unique identifier, which is restored to its original value when the corresponding answer is received. The request&#x27;s state is released upon receipt of the answer. Received answers that do not match a known Hop-by-Hop Identifier are ignored by the Diameter agent.

In case of redirecting agents, the Hop-by-Hop Identifier is maintained in the header as the Diameter agent responds with an answer message.

=== End-to-End Identifier ===
The End-to-End Identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in network byte order) that is used to detect duplicate messages along with the combination of the Origin-Host AVP.

When creating a request, the End-to-End Identifier is set to a locally unique value. The End-to-End Identifier is not modified by Diameter agents of any kind, and the same value in the corresponding request is used in the answer.

=== Attribute–Value Pairs (AVP) ===
For simplicity, AVP Flag &quot;V&quot; bit Means Vendor Specific; &quot;M&quot; bit means Mandatory; &quot;P&quot; bit means Protected.

The &quot;V&quot; bit, known as the Vendor-Specific bit, indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. When set the AVP Code belongs to the specific vendor code address space.

The &quot;M&quot; bit, known as the Mandatory bit, indicates whether support of the AVP is required. If an AVP with the &quot;M&quot; bit set is received by a Diameter client, server, proxy, or translation agent and either the AVP or its value is unrecognized, the message &quot;must&quot; be rejected. Diameter Relay and redirect agents &quot;must not&quot; reject messages with unrecognized AVPs.

The &quot;P&quot; bit indicates the need for encryption for end-to-end security.

=== State machines ===
The RFC 3588 defines a core state machine for maintaining connections between peers and processing messages. This is part of the basic protocol functionality and all stacks should support it and as such abstract from the connectivity related operations.
Additionally, application specific state machines can be introduced either later or at a higher abstraction layer. The RFC 3588 defines an authorization and an accounting state machine.
=== Message flows ===

The communication between two diameter peers starts with the establishment of a transport connection (TCP or SCTP). The initiator then sends a Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) to the other peer, which responds with a Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA). For RFC3588 compliant peers TLS (Transport Layer Security) may optionally be negotiated. For RFC6733 compliant peers TLS negotiation may optionally happen before the CER/CEA.

The connection is then ready for exchanging application messages.

If no messages have been exchanged for some time either side may send a Device-Watchdog-Request (DWR) and the other peer must respond with Device-Watchdog-Answer.

Either side may terminate the communication by sending a Disconnect-Peer-Request (DPR) which the other peer must respond to with Disconnect-Peer-Answer. After that the transport connection can be disconnected.

<doc id="1105555" wikidata="Q1476589" url="?curid=1105555" title="Minnesota Swarm">
<text>The Minnesota Swarm was a box lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League who played at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 2004 until 2015. The team&#x27;s previous owners (Minnesota Sports &amp; Entertainment) who also own the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota Wild purchased the rights to the inactive Montreal Express team on August 10, 2004. The name Swarm was selected over Thrill, Rush and Bullheads on October 25, 2004.

On July 16, 2008, John J. Arlotta and his son Andy Arlotta were officially announced as the team&#x27;s new owners.
On May 22, 2015, The Swarm announced that they would be relocating for the 2016 NLL Season. On May 29, they announced that they would play in Duluth, Georgia, for the 2016 season as the Georgia Swarm.
==History==
===2004–2015===

The Minnesota Swarm played their first exhibition game on December 10, 2004 against the Colorado Mammoth. The team drew over 14,000 fans — a record for an NLL preseason game very common for NHL ownership in the league. The Swarm&#x27;s first regular season game was in Rochester against the Knighthawks on January 1, 2005, in which the Swarm won 12–11. Craig Conn scored the first goal in franchise history. Their first home regular season game was January 21, 2005 against the Buffalo Bandits. The coach of the team for the first season was Mike Simpson and the general manager was Marty O&#x27;Neill. Later on the swarm was sold to Arlotta family which eventually moved the franchise to Georgia.

Forward Craig Conn and defenseman Ryan Cousins were named reserves for the East Division All-Star Team at the 2005 NLL All Star Game. Ryder Bateman ranked tied for second among NLL rookies in goals and third in scoring. The team finished the season with a 5–11 record. In August 2005, Adam Mueller was named as the head coach of the team.

The Swarm made the NLL playoffs after the 2006 season with an 8–8 record. In July 2006 Adam Mueller resigned as coach and was replaced on August 1 by Duane Jacobs. In 2007 the Swarm improved to a 9–7 record, again making the playoffs. General Manager Marty O&#x27;Neill was named NLL GM of the Year.

As a promotional stunt for the 2007 season opener, local sports newscaster Eric Perkins signed a one-game contract to play for the Swarm. Commercials were aired on NBC showing Perkins at a news conference taunting the Chicago Shamrox. He did end up getting 8 seconds of playing time in the 11–10 loss. In 2008, The Swarm announced that they would be retiring Perkins&#x27; number 66.

In Week 7 of the 2008 NLL season, the Swarm established a league record by running up a 12–0 lead before the New York Titans broke their scoreless streak in the third quarter of the contest. For the third year in a row, the Swarm improved their record over the previous season, finishing with a 10–6 record. They lost to the New York Titans in the division semi-finals, but GM Marty O&#x27;Neill was once again named NLL GM of the Year, becoming the only multiple winner of this award.

Minnesota finished the 2009 season with a 6–10 record. The team failed to make it to the playoffs for the second time in franchise history. Kevin Buchanan led all Swarm rookies in goals (22), assists (23) and points (45). He received NLL Rookie of the Week honors twice and was named to the All-Rookie Team. After serving as an assistant coach from 2008–09, Mike Lines was named as head coach of the Swarm in August 2009.

The Swarm finished the 2010 season with a 5–11 record, and advanced to the postseason where it fell 14–10 to the eventual NLL Champion Washington Stealth in the first round of the playoffs. During the 2010 season, Minnesota had three of the league&#x27;s Top 10 scorers in Callum Crawford, Aaron Wilson, and Ryan Benesch. Callum Crawford also set two Swarm records by tallying 96 points and 64 assists during the season.

Improving to an 8–8 record in the 2011 season, the Swarm advanced to the playoffs and was defeated 14–8 by the Washington Stealth for the second consecutive year in the first round of the playoffs. Ryan Benesch led the league as the Top Scorer with 95 points and also led the league with 46 goals, setting a new Swarm record. Representing the Swarm in the Western Division All-Star game, Ryan Benesch and Nick Patterson were selected as starters for the team and Callum Crawford and Andrew Watt were named as reserves.

===Relocation to Georgia===

On May 22, 2015, team owner John Arlotta announced that the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Swarm, did not renew the contract for the team. Instead of negotiating for a new lease, the Swarm began looking for more profitable states to relocate to.

Announced in a press release, Arlotta stated that, &quot;The sport of lacrosse is growing at a rapid pace in Georgia and we&#x27;re thrilled to bring the fastest game on two feet at the professional level to the arena at Gwinnett Center.&quot; Arlotta also added: &quot;We have to be on a forward trajectory,&quot; and &quot;We need to find an arena that works better for an individual owner.&quot;

The Swarm announced on May 29 that they would be relocating to Georgia for the upcoming 2016 NLL season. The Swarm will now play in the 13,000-seat Arena at Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Georgia, as the Georgia Swarm.

Movement to bring the NLL back to Minnesota

On May 23, 2015 an effort was launched by fans of the former Minnesota Swarm called &#x27;Bring back the NLL to Minnesota&#x27;. Its purpose was to express discontent with the league and owners of the Swarm for moving the team, and to rally supporters to bring a new NLL team to the Twin Cities.

<doc id="1105557" wikidata="Q1362494" url="?curid=1105557" title="Rapunzel syndrome">
<text>Rapunzel syndrome is an extremely rare intestinal condition in humans resulting from ingesting hair (trichophagia). The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Trichophagia is sometimes associated with the hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania. This syndrome is a rare and unusual form of trichobezoar. Since 1968, there have been fewer than 40 documented cases in the literature. This syndrome occurs when the trichobezoar (hairball) reaches past the small intestine, and sometimes even into the colon producing a long tail-like extension of hair (NCBI, 2016).

==Signs and symptoms==
The use of the term Rapunzel syndrome first appeared in the literature in 1968.

Characteristics of the syndrome include:
* The body of a trichobezoar (hairball) located in the stomach, and its tail (hence the reference to Rapunzel in the syndrome&#x27;s name) in the small bowel and/or in the right colon
* Small or large bowel obstruction
* Occurring in psychiatric patients
* Trichotillomania
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea &amp; vomiting
* Gut perforation
* Vitamin B12 deficiency
* Acute pancreatic necrosis

==Cause==
Rapunzel syndrome is caused by the ingestion of hair. Rapunzel syndrome is characterized by a compulsive disorder of pulling one&#x27;s own hair and ingesting it. There are several psychiatric disorders that are associated with Rapunzel syndrome, such as trichotillomania, trichophagia, and pica. Trichotillomania is the compulsion to pull out one&#x27;s own hair; if an individual consumes it after ripping it out as well, it is known as trichophagia. Pica comes from the Latin word for &quot;magpie&quot; and involves the craving of non-food items such as cloth, wool, hair, or even small metallic objects.

==Diagnosis==
Trichobezoar can be preoperatively diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of the Rapunzel syndrome has to consider several aspects such as the patient&#x27;s history with disorders like trichophagia and trichotillomania. This syndrome does not appear in the DSM V, and will therefore not be given as such, but will have been diagnosed as severe trichotillomania. The syndrome itself is used to describe the manifestation of a trichobezoar which has extended far into the small intestine. It describes the trichobezoar, not the mental health disorder which precipitated it.

The diagnosis of the syndrome is also done by endoscopy. A CT scan is recommended to determine the size and the extension of the trichobezoar. Upper GI endoscopy is known as the gold standard for the diagnosis of a trichobezoar, however the endoscopy alone might not necessarily detect the co-existing Rapunzel syndrome.

== Treatment ==
Because the human gastrointestinal tract is unable to digest human hair, the trichobezoar may have to be treated surgically. This involves removal of the mass by careful extraction from the stomach and duodenum. If the mass is small enough it can be removed endoscopically. Once the mass surpasses greater than 20 centimeters, it must be removed by gastrotomy. It is recommended that general anesthesia with intubation be used when removing the hairball in order to protect the throat from any damage. Patients usually also require psychiatric evaluation and treatment due to the association with impulse control disorders, especially trichotillomania. Long-term follow up as well as psychiatric consultation is also recommended to prevent the event from repeating.

== Outcomes ==
The expected outlook after surgical intervention is very promising. The success rate of removal of the mass is above 90% and the complication rate is only near 10%. Recurrence is highly uncommon but can occur if the patient does not follow up on psychological treatment or counseling.

== Epidemiology ==
Rapunzel syndrome is extremely rare, with fewer than 64 cases reported since 1968. It is mainly seen in emotionally or mentally disturbed young or adolescent females. The first known case dates back to a 16-year-old boy in 1779; this was eventually published by Vaughan et al. in 1968. Of the cases reported, the typical age range affected from this syndrome is between 4 and 19 years of age. There is no specific region that is subject to developing this condition, however of the cases reported all of the women came from countries where women traditionally had long hair. Women are more subject to this disorder because women often have longer hair than men. There is only one reported male case of Rapunzel syndrome, but he was eating his sister&#x27;s hair and not his own.

== Research ==
Although this condition is extremely rare, researchers have mentioned that it is absolutely critical that prevention methods are taken after surgery. The most common reason for recurrence in patients is lack of follow-up care and incompletion of psychological treatment. Researchers have concluded that 92.5% of all cases reported were treated by laparotomy with a 99% success rate (NCBI,2016). There have been few reports of successful treatment through laparoscopic surgery, however this has only been reported to be done in pediatric patients.

<text>The Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), formerly the State Electoral Office, is the statutory body responsible for the running of state, municipal and various non-government elections in Victoria, Australia.

==Independence==

It is an independent agency, established under Victoria&#x27;s &quot;Electoral Act&quot; 2002, the VEC falls under the umbrella of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The VEC head office is located on level 11, 530 Collins Street, Melbourne, although during the state election there may be as many as 88 offices established throughout Victoria.

The VEC is subject to oversight by the Victorian Parliament&#x27;s Electoral Matters Committee which regularly holds inquiries into the conduct of public elections and associated matters in Victoria. The committee was established under the &quot;Parliamentary Committees Act 2003&quot; and has members from both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council.

==Functions==

===State elections===
The primary function of the VEC is to conduct Victorian state elections, the last of which was the 2022 state election which was held on Saturday, 26 November 2022. Prior to 2006, Victorian parliamentary elections could be held any time at the discretion of the government in the last year of their four-year term of office. This has meant that, in practice, the average period between elections had been somewhat less than the maximum four years. From 2006 the Victorian Parliament has fixed terms with the election being held every fourth year on the last Saturday in November.

===Municipal elections===
Municipal, or local government, elections are also conducted by the VEC in Victoria. Previously there was a system of competitive tendering between the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the VEC, but the AEC withdrew. The VEC still submits tenders to each council to run the municipal elections. Municipal elections take place in October every four years. The most recent municipal elections took place in October 2020 and the next elections will be in October 2024.

===Non-government elections===
Private organisations may hire the VEC to conduct elections for them. These may include board elections.

===Liquor licensing polls===
Until December 2021, there were certain &quot;dry areas&quot; in the City of Whitehorse and City of Boroondara which required a poll to be conducted by the VEC before granting a liquor license in that dry area. If a majority of electors in that area voted against the proposed license, that license was not granted and any other liquor license applications were not allowed to be proposed in that area for 3 years. Following amendments to the Liquor Control Reform Act 1998, these dry areas were abolished so the polls no longer need to be conducted. 

===Electoral enrolment===
The VEC&#x27;s Electoral Enrolment Branch maintains the State electoral roll. Unlike all other states (with the exception of Western Australia), the VEC maintains its own roll rather than depending on the Commonwealth roll which is maintained by the AEC. The VEC still receives updates from the AEC to ensure that the Commonwealth and Victorian rolls mirror each other.

The VEC conducts several promotional programs to ensure that electors update their information when their enrolment details change.

===Boundary redistributions===
The VEC assists the Electoral Boundaries Commission in redistributing state electoral boundaries from time to time. It also performs similar tasks in relation to local government.

<doc id="1105579" wikidata="Q1638571" url="?curid=1105579" title="French battleship Jean Bart (1940)">
<text>Jean Bart was a French fast battleship, the second and final member of the . Built as a response to the Italian , the &quot;Richelieu&quot;s were based on their immediate predecessors of the with the same unconventional arrangement that grouped their main battery forward in two quadruple gun turrets. They were scaled up to accommodate a much more powerful main battery of eight guns (compared to the guns of the &quot;Dunkerque&quot;s), with increased armor to protect them from guns of the same caliber. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was laid down in 1936 and was launched in 1940, following the outbreak of World War II in Europe. The ship was not complete by the time Germany won the Battle of France, and &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was rushed to Casablanca to escape advancing German troops. She had only one of her main turrets installed, along with a handful of anti-aircraft guns.

While in Casablanca, the French attempted to prepare the ship for action as much as was possible in light of limited infrastructure and the necessary parts to complete the vessel. Her anti-aircraft armament was slowly strengthened as guns became available and a search radar was fitted in 1942. In November, American and British forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch; &quot;Jean Bart&quot; initially helped to resist the attack, engaging in a gunnery duel with the battleship before being badly damaged by American dive bombers. Following the defection of French forces in the region to the Allied side, the French attempted to have the ship completed in the United States, but the requests came to nothing as the US Navy had no interest in the project. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was accordingly repaired as much as possible in Casablanca, thereafter spending the rest of the war as a training ship there.

In 1945, discussions as to the fate of the ship considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, finishing her as a battleship, or discarding her altogether. The decision was ultimately made to finish her as a battleship, a process that took several years. Most work on the ship was completed by 1955, when she formally entered active service, and she conducted two overseas cruises to visit Denmark and the United States shortly thereafter. For the only time, &quot;Richelieu&quot; and &quot;Jean Bart&quot; cruised together on 30 January 1956. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; took part in the French intervention in the Suez Crisis in November 1956, including a brief four-shot bombardment of Port Said. Reduced to reserve in August 1957, she was used as a barracks ship until 1961. She remained, unused, in the French Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1970 when she was struck from the naval register and sold for scrap.

== Design==


When in 1934 Italy announced that it would begin building two s armed with guns, the French Navy immediately began preparations to counter them. The small s that had been ordered provided the template for the next French battleship design, but it needed to be scaled up to match the new Italian vessels, both in terms of offensive and defensive characteristics. The design staff considered 380 and guns, but the latter could not be incorporated in a design that remained within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty and was quickly discarded. The &quot;Dunkerque&quot;s carried their armament in two quadruple gun turrets arrayed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure, and the designers experimented with other arrangements, including combinations of triple and twin turrets, but the need to minimize the length of the armor belt (and thus its weight) necessitated a repetition of the &quot;Dunkerque&quot; layout.

&quot;Jean Bart&quot; displaced standard and fully loaded, with an overall length of , a beam of and a maximum draft of . She was powered by four Parsons geared steam turbines and six oil-fired Sural water-tube boilers, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of . At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . Her crew numbered 1,569 officers and men. The ship carried four Loire 130 seaplanes on the fantail, and the aircraft facilities consisted of a steam catapult and a crane to handle the floatplanes.

She was armed with eight 380 mm/45 Modèle (Mle) 1935 guns arranged in two quadruple gun turrets, both of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward of the superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of nine /55 Mle 1930 guns mounted in three triple turrets, arranged on the rear superstructure. Heavy anti-aircraft (AA) defense consisted of twelve /45 Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns in twin turrets. Close range anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of eight  guns in twin mounts and twenty  machine guns in four quadruple and two twin mounts. The ship&#x27;s belt armor was thick amidships, and the main battery turrets were protected by of armor plate on the faces. The main armored deck was thick, and the conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==

=== Construction and escape to Casablanca ===

The French Navy awarded the contract for &quot;Jean Bart&quot; on 27 May 1936 to the Chantiers de Penhoët shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, although construction was sub-contracted to the adjacent A. C. Loire shipyard as its own facilities were busy with the &quot;Dunkerque&quot;-class battleship . The keel for &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was laid down on 12 December, less than three weeks before the Washington Treaty expired. The construction of &quot;Jean Bart&quot; and her sister ship placed France in violation of the terms of the treaty, which had limited the country to build of battleships during the ten-year building moratorium. The two &quot;Richelieu&quot;s and the two &quot;Dunkerque&quot;-class battleships totaled of battleship tonnage. France used the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which Britain had unilaterally signed with Nazi Germany (and in the process effectively nullified the naval disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles) in June 1935 to dismiss British objections to the new ships. Serious work on the ship was nevertheless delayed owing to the shortage of dockyard workers and the need to complete the hull of the &quot;Strasbourg&quot; so she could be launched later that month. The dry dock used to build the ship was A. C. Loire&#x27;s newly completed Caquot dock, named for its designer, Albert Caquot, though it was commonly referred to as the &quot;&quot;Jean Bart&quot; dock&quot;. Work on the ship initially proceeded slowly, though the increase in tensions with Germany in early 1939 leading to the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II led to greater emphasis being placed on completing the ship.

She was launched on 6 March 1940, but following the initial German successes in the Battle of France in May, the builders realized that the normal process of fitting-out would have to be abandoned in favor of preparing the vessel to be moved from the port. Work on the ship&#x27;s propulsion system was greatly accelerated: some 3,500 workers were assigned to the project, and in the span of a month, three of her boilers, two sets of turbines, two turbo generators, and two pumps had been installed, along with critical internal communications systems. The outer shaft screws were installed on 6 and 7 June, and her three aft boilers had fires lit for the first time from 12 to 14 June. Her rudder and anchor chains were installed, and her double bottom was sealed. At this time, the ship&#x27;s armament was mostly incomplete; the forward main battery turret had its guns and armor plate installed, but it lacked necessary shell handling equipment and fire control systems. The superfiring turret was without its guns or armor and none of the secondary turrets had been installed. During the rush to prepare the ship to depart, a pair of twin-mount Mle 1930 anti-aircraft guns, taken from the net layer , was installed on 18 June in place of the 100 mm guns, construction of which had been delayed, but they had no ammunition or directors at the time. Three of the 37 mm guns and six of the 13.2 mm mounts were installed, and these were the only usable weapons aboard the ship at the time of her departure, albeit only under local control as their director systems were also still incomplete.

While work was still being completed, the ship&#x27;s commander, &quot;Capitaine de vaisseau&quot; (&quot;CV&quot;—Ship-of-the-line captain) Pierre-Jean Ronarc&#x27;h received orders on 11 June to depart for Casablanca in French Morocco as soon as was practical. He estimated that 19 June would be the best opportunity based on the tides, and early that morning &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was towed out of the fitting-out dock by three tugboats at 03:30 and into a channel that had been quickly but not sufficiently dredged to allow her escape. The ship accidentally grounded in the darkness, bending one of her screw blades, but the tugs pulled her free and at 04:45, the crew got &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s engines started. Shortly thereafter, three German Heinkel He 111 bombers arrived at a height of to attack the ship. One of the aircraft scored a hit with a bomb that struck between the main battery turrets but did insignificant damage. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; increased speed to and at 06:30, rendezvoused with the destroyers and , which were to escort her to Casablanca. The British destroyer and two tugs met the ship at sea, offering to tow &quot;Jean Bart&quot; to Britain, but Ronarc&#x27;h declined the offer. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; took on fuel oil at sea from a pair of tankers and at 18:00, she left the area with the two destroyers. While cruising off Lorient the next day, the destroyer relieved &quot;Le Hardi&quot; and the three ships continued on at a speed of . They arrived in Casablanca at 17:00 on 22 June.

===At Casablanca===
After arriving in Casablanca, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; had most of her anti-aircraft guns removed to strengthen the defenses of the port: the 90 mm and 37 mm guns were moved to the jetties protecting the harbor and two of the six 13.2 mm guns were put on trucks. Following their defeat in the Battle of France, the French signed the Armistice of 22 June 1940, ending their participation in the conflict. During the peace negotiations, the French proposed neutralizing &quot;Jean Bart&quot; and several other ships in Oran, French Algeria, but they ultimately agreed to take &quot;Jean Bart&quot; and &quot;Richelieu&quot; to Toulon to be demobilized. The Germans later decided against permitting the move, as they feared the British would try to seize the ship during the passage through the Strait of Gibraltar; the British, meanwhile, were under the mistaken impression that the Germans sought to seize the French fleet for their own use. This led to Operation Catapult, a series of attacks on French warships to neutralize vessels that would not defect to the Free French.

The attacks prompted Ronarc&#x27;h to take precautions to protect his ship. He ordered the open barbettes for the secondary turrets and the incomplete superfiring turret covered with concrete, and much of the hull was sealed. He moved the ship to shallow water on 11 August. Eleven days later, &quot;CV&quot; Émile Barthes replaced Ronarc&#x27;h. In September work to ready the ship for combat as much as could be done with the limited material in Casablanca began. On 7 September, the ship received sixteen 13.2 mm guns and seventeen machine guns, though only one of the latter was actually installed as the light machine guns were of limited use. In 1941, an improvised director was fabricated using a torpedo tube platform removed from the old destroyer as a base for a rangefinder. For navigational purposes, a rangefinder was installed on the conning tower and two more were added to the bridge wings in October.

The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft battery was strengthened in April 1942 with the addition of four 37 mm guns in single mounts and a pair of new twin 90 mm guns. By May, the forward main battery turret had been rendered fully operational and on 19 May, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; conducted test firing. The makeshift director did not work particularly well, so a triangulation system using observers aboard the ship and in two points at Dar Bouazza and Sidi Abderrahman to direct the ship&#x27;s guns was improvised. Four 37 mm guns in twin mounts were installed in June, along with another pair of 90 mm twin mounts, but three of the four 37 mm single guns were removed. A DEM radar was installed and tests over the following months demonstrated that the set was able to detect aircraft at ranges as far as , but owing to the cluttered harbor facilities around the ship, its abilities to detect surface ships could not be examined. The radar was pronounced ready for service on 6 October. In early November, the ship received a fifth 90 mm twin mount, with a sixth planned; at that time, the anti-aircraft battery consisted of five 90 mm twin mounts, five 37 mm guns (two in twins and one in a single mount), eighteen 13.2 mm guns (two twin and fourteen individual mounts) and one 8 mm machine gun.

====Operation Torch====
American and British forces embarked on Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, on 8 November. An American covering force that included the battleship (armed with nine guns), the aircraft carriers and , and three heavy cruisers led the invasion fleet that landed near Casablanca; the Americans hoped the French defenders would quickly surrender and defect to the Free French. A French reconnaissance aircraft detected the fleet at 07:00 that morning, and to oppose the landing, the French had one light cruiser, nine destroyers, and several submarines, in addition to the coastal battery at El Hank and &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, which would be employed as a floating battery. Before the French vessels could mount a significant challenge to the invasion, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and the heavy cruisers and , began bombarding the port while a group of SBD Dauntless dive bombers armed with bombs from &quot;Ranger&quot; struck the ships in the harbor. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; received a pair of bomb hits at 07:18; the first damaged the port catapult, started a fire, and caused the manual steering compartment to flood. The second struck the quay and exploded, the blast causing significant deformation to the hull plating on the starboard side.

In return, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; fired four two-gun salvos between 07:08 and 07:19, but when the French cruiser and destroyers attempted to sortie, they laid a smoke screen that drifted and blocked observation of the American cruisers. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; then engaged &quot;Jean Bart&quot; and at 07:25, scored a hit that penetrated both of the French ship&#x27;s armor decks and exploded in the empty magazines for the missing 152 mm guns. Another salvo landed close to &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s bow at 07:35 and deformed the hull plating. Another shell struck the quay a minute later, hurling fragments of concrete that injured anti-aircraft gunners and caused additional flooding. At 07:37, another 406 mm shell hit the ship, passing through the funnel and striking the edge of the armor deck. Another shell struck the edge of the quay, punched the outer plating, and was deflected down by the armor belt. It then passed through the bottom of the hull, burying itself in the sea floor, where it failed to explode. At 08:06, another salvo struck the ship with a pair of shells. The first struck the operational main battery turret, pushing the front glacis down and jamming the turret, and the second hit the superfiring barbette. This shell broke up on impact, but fragments nevertheless damaged the armor deck. One more shell from &quot;Massachusetts&quot; struck the ship at 08:10 on the quarterdeck, where it penetrated the sloped armor deck and exploded in the ballast compartment, causing additional flooding in the steering compartment.

Despite the numerous shell and bomb hits, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; had not been seriously damaged, though this was unknown to the Americans. Workers quickly cut away the deformed steel that jammed the main battery turret and it was back in operation at 17:24. Only one of the 406 mm shells could have threatened the ship&#x27;s survival, as an explosion in the 152 mm magazine could have destroyed the vessel had it been full of propellant charges. The next day, the ship&#x27;s 90 mm guns were used to fire on advancing ground troops, and on 10 November, &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s forward turret engaged the heavy cruiser between 11:41 and 11:51, nearly hitting with her second salvo. Three of her nine two-gun salvos straddled &quot;Augusta&quot;, forcing the cruiser to withdraw at high speed and prompting &quot;Ranger&quot; to launch a second air strike on the ship.

Nine Dauntlesses, this time armed with bombs, and eight F4F Wildcat fighters attacked the ship at 15:00. The fighters strafed &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s anti-aircraft batteries to suppress them for the Dauntless attacks. Two of the bombers scored hits; the first caused extensive damage to the forecastle and the second destroyed a substantial part of the hull toward the stern. Both bombs caused serious fires that were suppressed by 20:00. Extensive flooding led the ship to settle by the stern and submerged the turbo generator room, while shock from the bomb explosions disabled the main diesel generators, leaving the backup diesels as the only source of electrical power. In the course of the engagements with American forces, 22 men had been killed and the same number had been wounded. She had fired just 25 shells from her main battery, but despite the significant damage from the bomb hits on 10 November, her turret remained operational, as did the 90 mm guns, though both batteries were without power.

===With the Free French===
French forces in North Africa signed an armistice on 11 November, prompting the Germans to invade the rest of Vichy France, which in turn led François Darlan, the former Chief of Staff of the French Navy, to defect to the Allies with the rest of the fleet. Repair work to make the ship seaworthy had already begun on 11 November, and by 15 February 1943, the outboard turbines were in service and manual steering controls had been repaired. Admiral Raymond Fenard, the head of the French naval mission to the US, requested that the US Navy take the ship to the United States to be repaired and completed, as they had begun to do with &quot;Richelieu&quot;. Fenard issued a report to the US Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Frederick J. Horne, on 15 April detailing the status of &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, but Horne replied on 1 May that the ship could not be completed to her original specifications. Five days later, the US Navy agreed that the ship would be taken to the United States in September, which necessitated repairs to the steering motors.
The Free French &quot;Service Central des Constructions et Armes Navales&quot; (Central Naval Technical Department) created two proposals to complete the ship with as few alterations from her current state as possible; both involved replacing the 380 mm guns with guns from the old battleship , since &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s guns were needed to replace the damaged guns aboard &quot;Richelieu&quot;. The first variant called for the quarterdeck to be modified to carry two large catapults capable of launching American TBF Avenger or British Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers and F6F Hellcat or Supermarine Seafire fighters. The total complement was to be six aircraft. In place of the superfiring main turret, three secondary turrets, and the 90 mm mounts, she would receive thirty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns in fifteen twin turrets. These would be supplemented by sixty-four Bofors guns in quadruple mounts and fifty Oerlikon cannon in single mounts. New fire control equipment was to be installed, including US-built directors and a Mk 4 fire control radar. The second proposal was less ambitious; the aircraft facilities were abandoned in favor of seventeen twin 5 in turrets, while the 40 mm battery would be increased to twenty quadruple mounts.

Horne rejected both proposals on 18 August and Fenard responded with a proposal to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier, which Horne also refused. On 8 December, Fenard appealed directly to Horne&#x27;s superior, Admiral Ernest King, the Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, but King informed Fenard in March 1944 that the US Navy had no interest in diverting critical wartime resources to complete the ship. By that time in the war, the US Navy had more than enough battleships and aircraft carriers to fulfill its operational needs and moreover, American shipyards could not easily reproduce the parts necessary to complete the ship according to any of the proposals; the US had only agreed to repair and modernize &quot;Richelieu&quot;, which had been in a more complete state than &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, after significant pressure from Britain. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; instead remained in Casablanca, where Free French authorities had already set about readying the ship for sea.

Options to complete the ship without US assistance were limited; the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon in November 1942 wrecked much of the shipyard facilities, and Brest would not be liberated until September 1944. The French inquired about the possibility of taking the ship to Gibraltar, but the shipyard there was overwhelmed with more critical projects. Nevertheless, the shipyard workers in Casablanca had readied the ship for sea trials by September 1943. During these operations, she was accompanied by the destroyers and and three US destroyers. Though her hull was still badly deformed from the damage incurred during Operation Torch and had not been cleaned of biofouling, she reached a speed of . For the remainder of the war, the vessel was used as a training ship.

===Completion===
With the end of the war in sight by early 1945, the French naval command began to make plans for the postwar fleet. On 22 February, they decided that &quot;Jean Bart&quot; would be completed, but there was no consensus as to how the ship was to be finished. One faction, including Fenard as well as Admirals Pierre Barjot and Louis Kahn (the latter being the Chief of Naval Construction), advocated converting the ship into an aircraft carrier, while others argued that the ship should be completed as a battleship. A third group suggested scrapping the ship and focusing on other projects. In July, Kahn prepared a proposal that would have produced a carrier with a capacity of forty aircraft (and fourteen spares), armed with a battery of sixteen anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, and protected with an armored flight deck that was 90 mm thick. Displacement was fixed at . The project would have cost 5 billion francs and taken five years to complete, which caused considerable opposition in the naval command, including Fenard. They objected to the cost and delays, along with the fact that the number of aircraft was half that of contemporary American and British carriers.

With the fate of the ship still in question, she left Casablanca on 25 August, bound for Cherbourg, which she reached four days later. At a meeting on 21 September, the naval command ruled out discarding the vessel. Given the objections to the aircraft carrier conversion, the construction department drew up estimates for how long it would take to manufacture the necessary 380 mm gun barrels, rebuild the superfiring turret, and stockpile the necessary munitions for the guns; the resulting figures projected that it would take four years to complete the vessel and another year to manufacture the shells and charges. The decision was made to finish &quot;Jean Bart&quot; along the same lines as &quot;Richelieu&quot;, albeit with improved anti-aircraft defenses. The naval historians John Jordan and Robert Dumas note that despite criticisms from officers of the French naval air arm, &quot;there can be no doubt that the decision against a carrier conversion was correct in that it would have resulted in a ship which was poor value for the effort and expenditure involved.&quot;

&quot;Jean Bart&quot; was then moved to Brest, where she was dry-docked for repairs to her hull that began on 11 March 1946. During this period, her propulsion system was also completed, her main and secondary turrets were installed, and her superstructure was modified for the new radar and fire control equipment that would be later installed. Work on the hull was completed on 26 November 1947, which allowed her to be moved from the dry dock to the fitting-out quay. There, further modifications were made to the superstructure and the guns for her primary and secondary turrets were installed. Thereafter followed another stint in the dry dock from 20 March to 9 October 1948, which involved the installation of bulges to the lower hull and her propeller shafts were repaired. Initial testing of her propulsion machinery began on 4 December, followed by full tests that began in January 1949. She then conducted gunnery tests, and in May, she was assigned to the &quot;Groupe des bâtiments de ligne&quot; (Battleship Group) with &quot;Richelieu&quot;, though the unit was disbanded in 1950.

=== Post war active service ===
&quot;Jean Bart&quot; participated in training exercises with the fleet off the coast of North Africa in May and June 1950. She spent the next several months in Brest, and in early 1951 resumed initial training. She went to Le Havre in May to have a degaussing system installed, followed by further training cruises and tests to determine fuel consumption in June. By 7 July, she had returned to the fitting-out quay in Brest for additional work. The ship&#x27;s main and secondary batteries were by now operational, and her propulsion system was complete, though she still lacked her anti-aircraft battery and fire control equipment. Beginning in November the shipyard embarked on the next phase modernization program, which included the installation of the anti-aircraft guns, modifying the 152 mm turrets to convert them to dual-purpose guns, and the fitting of fire control equipment. The new anti-aircraft battery consisted of twenty-four 100 mm guns in twin mounts and twenty-eight Bofors guns. At the same time, her main battery turrets were deactivated for preservation while work continued on the ship.

Work on the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft battery proceeded very slowly. The 100 mm guns were installed by mid-1952, but the directors for the 100 mm guns were not installed until May 1953, permitting test firings of the guns in July. The tests revealed the need for extensive modifications to the systems that were finally complete in October 1954. The 57 mm guns were even more delayed, with the guns not ready for tests until September 1955, though their optical directors were not fitted until August 1956. The period of work between 1951 and 1956 was interrupted by numerous sea trials to evaluate the vessel as each new type of equipment was installed. By the time work on the ship was completed, she had been fitted with a variety of radar sets, including a DRBV 11 air/surface search radar, a DRBV 20 air search radar, and a DRBV 30 navigational radar. Fire control radars included a DRBC 10A set for the main battery, six ACAE sets for the heavy anti-aircraft battery and five DRBC 30B sets for the light anti-aircraft guns. Her normal displacement had risen to , with full-load displacement at . With the greater weight of the ship, draft increased to .

She was finally pronounced complete on 1 May 1955, and that month she embarked President René Coty for a visit to Denmark, escorted by the destroyer . After returning from the cruise, which also included a visit to Oslo, Norway, she left in July to represent France at a celebration in New York of the 175th anniversary of the landing of French soldiers led by the Comte de Rochambeau during the American Revolutionary War. She thereafter conducted a series of training cruises off the coast of Brittany in August and September before transferring to the Mediterranean in October. She arrived in Toulon on 17 October, and four days later, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; replaced &quot;Richelieu&quot; as the flagship of the training squadron.

&quot;Jean Bart&quot; spent late 1955 and early 1956 in port and conducting gunnery training in Les Salins d&#x27;Hyères. For the first and last time of either of their careers, &quot;Richelieu&quot; and &quot;Jean Bart&quot; cruised together on 30 January 1956. In June 1956, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; went on a tour of French North Africa. As tensions with Egypt over the control of the Suez Canal flared in 1956, the decision was made on 8 July to deploy the ship to Egypt. &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s superfiring turret was reactivated in August and on 7 September, she conducted shooting practice with the turret in company with the cruiser off the coast of North Africa.

She thereafter deployed with the French Naval Intervention Force during the Suez Crisis, Operation Mousquetaire, though with only her superfiring turret in operation. During the operations off the canal zone, she carried a complement of 1,280 officers and men, despite the fact that her projected wartime crew amounted to 2,220. This meant that only half of her anti-aircraft guns could be manned. The ship departed Toulon on 26 October and steamed first to Algiers, French Algeria, where from 29 to 31 October, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment and Commando Hubert frogmen unit came aboard the ship. &quot;Jean Bart&quot; then joined the rest of the intervention force, which included the carriers and , &quot;Georges Leygues&quot;, the destroyers &quot;Surcouf&quot;, , , and , and an anti-submarine warfare group. The ships left on 1 November and reached Limassol, Cyprus on the 4th, where the paratroopers and frogmen transferred to amphibious assault ships. On 5 November, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; steamed south to bombard Port Said, but she fired only four rounds from her main battery before the landing was cancelled. She remained off the city for two more days before departing on the 7th and returning to Toulon by way of Limassol on 13 November.

On 1 December, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; returned to the training squadron. Her last period at sea took place from 11 to 19 July 1957; this was also the last time she fired her main battery. On 1 August, she was reduced to reserve status, despite the reluctance of many in the naval command to see the funds and effort expended in completing the ship be wasted. By this time, a new generation of post-war cruisers and destroyers were beginning to enter service, leading to significant crew shortages. Coupled with the cost of maintaining &quot;Jean Bart&quot; in service, the need to release the manpower tied up in the ship for more useful vessels led to her withdrawal from active service after just two years. The navy considered a number of modernization proposals to improve the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft battery or add guided missiles. The latter concept involved five different variants that ranged from adding missile launchers with 24–44 missiles to the quarterdeck to removing the main battery turrets and reconstructing the forward part of the ship to house a large missile battery with as many as 325 missiles. Alternatively, an air-defense missile armament for testing purposes was considered; this would have involved removing the centerline 152 mm turret and replacing it with a launcher for the American RIM-2 Terrier missile. The 152 mm turret would be retained for re-installation once the evaluation period was over.
None of the modernization or conversion projects came to fruition, and the missile batteries that involved removing the 380 mm turrets were not even seriously considered by the high command. In August 1957, the vessel was reduced to a barracks ship, and on 1 January 1961 her reserve status was downgraded. Some consideration was given in 1964 to reactivate the vessel for use as a command ship during a series of nuclear experiments in the Pacific Ocean, but it was determined that the cost would have been too high, thus the cruiser was used instead. The ship remained laid up until 10 February 1970 when she was struck from the naval register, renamed &quot;Q466&quot;, and placed for sale. The vessel was sold to ship breakers on 21 May, towed to Brégaillon, and dismantled for scrap. Though she never became fully operational, &quot;Jean Bart&quot; nevertheless proved to be a useful test bed for a variety of new French anti-aircraft guns and radars.

<text>Colin J. Campbell (24 July 1931 – 13 November 2022) was a British petroleum geologist who predicted that oil production would peak by 2007. He claimed the consequences of this are uncertain but drastic, due to the world&#x27;s dependency on fossil fuels for the vast majority of its energy. His theories have received wide attention but are disputed and have not significantly changed governmental energy policies at this time. To deal with declining global oil production, he proposed the Rimini protocol.

Influential papers by Campbell include &quot;The Coming Oil Crisis&quot;, written with Jean Laherrère in 1998 and credited with convincing the International Energy Agency of the coming peak; and &quot;The End of Cheap Oil&quot;, published the same year in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, founded by Campbell in 2000, has been gaining recognition in the recent years. The association has organised yearly international conferences since 2002. The most recent conference of the USA chapter (ASPO-USA) was at the University of Texas in Austin, TX on 30 November and 1 December 2012.

==Remarks==
The most famous peak oil petrogeologist is M. King Hubbert, who predicted in 1956 that oil production would peak in the United States between 1965 and 1970. US oil production peaked in 1970. Hubbert&#x27;s theories, particularly his evaluation of oil availability in any given area reaching a peak, to be followed by inevitable and sometimes rapid decline, were expounded in his Hubbert peak theory, and became popular during the 1973 energy crisis, and during the 1979 energy crisis when even the United States Secretary of Energy, James Schlesinger announced, as he left his post that year, that &#x27;Mid-East production is unlikely to expand much, if at all, and is unlikely to drop below current levels&#x27;. (Wall Street Journal 1979). In December 2000 Colin Campbell warned in a public lecture held at the Clausthal University of Technology that
&#x27;There is, I think, a strong danger of some ill-considered military intervention to try to secure oil. A stock market crash seems inevitable, as some investment managers are now telling us. The global market may collapse because of high transport costs and global recession. Self-sufficiency will become a priority.&#x27;
== Current debate ==

Global oil discovery peaked in 1964, and since the early 1980s oil production has outpaced new discoveries.

According to Campbell:

* There are no new potential oil fields sufficiently large to reduce this future energy crisis.
* The reported oil reserves of many OPEC countries are inflated, to increase their quotas, or improve their chance of getting a loan from the World Bank.
* The practice of gradually adding new discoveries to a country&#x27;s list of &quot;proven reserves&quot;, instead of all at once, artificially inflates the current rate of discovery.

In 1989 Campbell claimed that there would be a shortage towards the late 1990s. In 1990 he claimed that 1998 would represent a &quot;depletion midpoint.&quot; These early assessments were, however, according to Campbell himself, &quot;based on public domain data, before the degree of misreporting by industry and governments was appreciated.&quot;

A 2007 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre stated that Campbell failed to take into account future reserve growth in existing fields. The authors concluded that curve-fitting techniques, such as Campbell&#x27;s, tended to underestimate ultimate recoverable reserves. The report cited Campbell&#x27;s record of premature peak predictions, systematically shifting forward over time, as evidence that his methodology was flawed.

The US Department of Energy report &quot;Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, and Risk Management&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Hirsch Report&quot;, proposes an urgent mitigation approach to deal with the possibility of oil production going into decline in the immediate future.

It states: &quot;The peaking of world oil production presents the US and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem. As peaking is approached, liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically, and, without timely mitigation, the economic, social, and political costs will be unprecedented. Viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides, but to have substantial impact, they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking.&quot;

==Activities==
Campbell had over 40 years of experience in the oil industry. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and Wadham College, Oxford (BA Geology 1954, MA and DPhil 1957), and worked as a petroleum geologist in the field, as a manager, and as a consultant. He was employed by Oxford University, Texaco, British Petroleum, Amoco, Shenandoah Oil, Norsk Hydro, and Petrofina, and worked with the Bulgarian and Swedish governments. His writing included two books and more than 150 papers.

Later, he founded the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, was affiliated with Petroconsultants in Geneva, was a trustee of the Oil Depletion Analysis Centre in London. He conducted research on the oil peak, and he also tried to build public awareness of the issue, which included lecturing extensively. He addressed a committee of the British House of Commons, and officials from investment and automotive companies. He appeared in the documentary films &quot;The End of Suburbia&quot;, &quot;Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash&quot;, and &quot;Peak Oil – Imposed by Nature&quot;.

==Personal life==
Campbell resided in Ballydehob, a small town in South West Cork, Ireland with his wife Bobbins. He died at his home in Ireland on 13 November 2022, at the age of 91.

==Quotes==
&quot;But this peak has no real great significance, it is the perception and the vision of the long decline that comes into sight on the other side of the peak. That&#x27;s really what matters.&quot; (speaking on the peak oil phenomenon, from &quot;End of Oil&quot; (2005))

&quot;It&#x27;s quite a simple theory and one that any beer drinker understands. The glass starts full and ends empty and the faster you drink it the quicker it&#x27;s gone.&quot; (on peak oil, in 2007)

&quot;Banks had been lending more than they had on deposit assuming that tomorrow&#x27;s growth was collateral for today&#x27;s debt but failing to see that growth depends on growing, cheap, oil-based energy...So in short, Peak Oil means that debt goes bad.&quot; (speaking on the 2008 crash at the New Energy Era Forum, 8 May 2012)

<doc id="1105597" wikidata="Q16984672" url="?curid=1105597" title="Holt v. Sarver">
<text>Holt v. Sarver was a court decision that was the first in a series of American common law cases that have found entire state prison systems in violation of prisoners&#x27; constitutional rights by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas ruled that the Arkansas prison system, which at the time had no written standards, violated the US Constitution. The cases significantly altered the American prison system, specifically with regard to prisoners&#x27; rights under the Eighth Amendment.

==Arkansas cases==
In 1969 in &quot;Holt v. Sarver I&quot;, 300 F. Supp. 825 (E.D. Ark.), Judge J. Smith Henley ruled several aspects of Arkansas&#x27; existing prison system unconstitutional. He issued guidelines to follow for correcting the problems, and ordered administrators to report on the progress of the implementation of these guidelines.

In 1970 in &quot;Holt v. Sarver II&quot;, 309 F. Supp. 362 (E.D. Ark.), Judge Henley ruled the entire Arkansas prison system unconstitutional and ordered the State Correction Board to devise a plan of action. In that same case in 1971, Judge Henley enjoined the Arkansas prison from preventing the inmates&#x27; access to court and from inflicting cruel and unusual punishment upon them.

==Prior history==
The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Jones v. Cunningham&quot; in 1963 that inmates in state institutions could file a writ of habeas corpus challenging the conditions of their imprisonment as well as its legality. This ruling reversed the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;hands off&quot; policy regarding federal interference in state penal issues first clearly stated in 1866 in &quot;Pervear v. Massachusetts&quot;. Subsequently, in a series of cases starting with &quot;Gates v. Collier&quot; the federal government began whole scale intervention in the constitutionality of the operation of state prison systems.

<doc id="1105600" wikidata="Q816453" url="?curid=1105600" title="Ben Caunt">
<text>Ben Caunt (22 March 1815 – 10 September 1861) was a 19th-century English bare-knuckle boxer who became the heavyweight boxing champion known as the &quot;Torkard Giant&quot; and &quot;Big Ben&quot;.

==Early life==
Caunt was born on 22 March 1815 in Hucknall Torkard, in Nottinghamshire, England. Caunt stood tall and weighed 18 stone. He was said to be strong, durable, and willing yet also slow and clumsy. His early boxing career is not well known, but he did defeat several minor local opponents at the age of 18.

==Boxing career==
In 1834 he beat George Graham (of Lincolnshire). On 21 July 1835, Caunt boxed William &quot;Bendigo&quot; Thompson and was disqualified for an alleged foul striking Thompson while he was sitting in his corner.

On 17 August 1837, Caunt fought and beat William Butler at Stoneyford in Derbyshire, and on 4 November Bill Boniford at Sunrise Hill.

On 3 April 1838, Caunt again fought William Thompson on Skipworth Common, and after 76 rounds Thompson was disqualified for going down without being struck; Caunt claimed the Heavyweight Championship of England but this was not generally accepted.

On 24 June of the same year, Caunt was scheduled to again fight William Thompson but the bout was cancelled.

On 26 October 1840, Caunt defeated Bill Brassey at Six Mile Bottom in 101 rounds.

On 2 February 1841, Caunt fought Nick Ward on Crookham Common for the Heavyweight Championship of England where the crowd forced the referee to disqualify Caunt for an alleged blow striking Ward while he was down.

Caunt avenged this defeat on 11 May of the same year, defeating Ward in 35 rounds at Long Marston to become the Heavyweight Champion of England. On 10 September 1841 Caunt sailed to America to challenge Tom Hyer to a world championship bout, but Hyer never replied. Caunt returned to England on 10 March 1842 with the &quot;American Giant&quot; Charles Freeman.

In 1845 he was challenged for the English heavyweight title by William Thompson. On 9 September Caunt lost at Stony Stratford, with a disputable decision after 93 rounds where it was alleged that Caunt went down without a blow striking him. Caunt denied this accusation and announced his retirement, only to return for a final attempt at the heavyweight crown 12 years later.

==Retirement and attempted comeback==
Between 1845 and 1851, Caunt worked as farm labourer and then became the landlord of the Coach and Horses pub at St Martin&#x27;s Lane, a business that made him very prosperous until the premises were destroyed in a fire that killed two of his children.

In his final fight on 21 September 1857, Caunt fought Nat Langham at Home Circuit, where after 60 rounds both men were too exhausted to continue and a draw was declared.

==Death and legacy==
Caunt died of pneumonia on 10 September 1861 at an address in St Martin&#x27;s Lane in London. He is buried outside the north transept of the Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall close to the grave of his two children who died in the Coach and Horses fire.

It is said that Big Ben, the hour bell of the clock-tower of the Palace of Westminster, is named after this English heavyweight champion. The origin of the name is contested with Westminster&#x27;s Chief Lord of the Woods and Forests, Sir Benjamin Hall. A large and ponderous man known affectionately in the House as &quot;Big Ben&quot;, he is said to have given an impressively long speech on the subject. When, at the end of this oratorical marathon, Sir Benjamin sank back into his seat, a wag in the chamber shouted out: &quot;Why not call him Big Ben and have done with it?&quot; The house erupted in laughter; Big Ben had been named. This, at least, is the most commonly accepted story. However, according to the booklet written for the old Ministry of Works by Alan Phillips (1959):

<text>Darren Carl Huckerby (born 23 April 1976) is an English football coach and former professional footballer. 

As a player, he was a forward who notably played in the Premier League for Newcastle United, Coventry City, Leeds United, Manchester City and Norwich City. He also featured for Lincoln City, Millwall and Nottingham Forest. He finished his career by playing in the United States in Major League Soccer for San Jose Earthquakes. He was capped once at England B level.

Following retirement, he had a spell as academy coach for the Under 16s of former club Norwich City.

==Club career==

===Lincoln City===
Huckerby was born in Nottingham, England. His mother is of partial Georgian descent. Huckerby started playing professionally for Lincoln City in Football League Division Three. Huckerby was promoted to the first team at Sincil Bank by Keith Alexander, but also played under the stewardship of both Sam Ellis and Steve Wicks before being sold in 1995. He finished his spell with Lincoln having scored 5 goals in 28 league appearances.

===Newcastle United===
Huckerby made a three division step up by signing for Premier League title contenders Newcastle United in a £400,000 deal in 1995. Despite being highly rated by the fans and pundits, Huckerby found first team chances severely limited, especially since manager Kevin Keegan decided to scrap the reserve team, in response to a requirement from the FA that a certain percentage of home reserve fixtures be played at St James&#x27; Park. Keegan believed that this would negatively affect the pitch condition, which was already in poor state. This of course meant that, with no reserve team football, Huckerby was not match fit for the majority of his time on Tyneside. Huckerby made only two appearances for the Magpies (one in the league and one in the FA Cup), before being loaned out to Millwall. Huckerby then joined Coventry City for £1 million in time for the start of the next season, signed by then City boss Gordon Strachan.

===Coventry City===
The striker&#x27;s pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with Dion Dublin saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin&#x27;s partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry&#x27;s Premier League survival, culminating with a final day 2–1 win at Tottenham Hotspur in 1997. His success with the &quot;Sky Blues&quot; continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3–2 victory over Manchester United at Highfield Road, a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past Kevin Pilkington. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals.

===Leeds United===
He was sold to Leeds United the following summer for a reputed £6 million. In his time at Elland Road, he scored two goals in 40 league games, once against former club Coventry City and another against Watford. He had to compete for a place in the team with some players such as Mark Viduka, Alan Smith and Michael Bridges and as a result he was never a regular, although he did score against Partizan Belgrade in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, and in a 6–0 win against Beşiktaş in the 2000–01 Champions League. In all competitions, he scored six goals in total.

===Manchester City===
Manchester City signed him in December 2000 for £3.38 million, as they attempted to avoid relegation. Huckerby scored on his debut against Charlton Athletic, albeit in a 4-1 defeat. Although the club did eventually go down, he stayed on and won a First Division championship medal, adding 26 goals in all competitions during the campaign, including two hat-tricks.

Huckerby started the new campaign as first choice, and scored the team&#x27;s first goal of the season, a header against former employer Newcastle that secured a 1–0 win. However, the arrivals of Nicolas Anelka and Jon Macken meant less playing time, and he eventually ended up playing out the end of the season on-loan to Nottingham Forest, being part of the team that reached the Division One playoffs in 2003.

===Norwich City===
Huckerby spent a three-month loan spell with Norwich City, before signing permanently in December 2003, for a fee of £750,000, which rose to £1 million when &quot;the Canaries&quot; were promoted at the end of the season. At Norwich, Huckerby&#x27;s career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the 2003–04 season. He was instrumental in Norwich&#x27;s march to the First Division championship in 2003–04, and came second in the supporters vote for player of the season behind Craig Fleming.

Reverting to a left wing role for much of Norwich&#x27;s Premier League spell in 2004–05, Huckerby scored seven goals. He was linked with a transfer to either Liverpool or Celtic the following summer, but spoke of his intention to see out his contract in East Anglia.

He was voted Norwich City player of the year by supporters in 2004–05 and 2006–07, and placed second behind Gary Doherty for the 2005–06 season, winning the award twice and adding two runner-up positions in his first four seasons. He was voted into the Norwich City Hall of Fame in 2004. On 13 April 2008, he played his 200th game for Norwich, in the East Anglian Derby against Ipswich Town.

On 4 May 2008, Huckerby scored in his final game for the club in a 4–1 defeat away at Sheffield Wednesday. Two days later, it was announced that his contract would not be renewed as he could not be guaranteed a place in the first team in the 2008–09 season. This upset fans who felt that Huckerby, a fan favourite, deserved a proper farewell. However, an opportunity was made with a special tribute at a &#x27;Greatest Ever&#x27; event at Carrow Road held later in May.

In 2012, Huckerby returned to Carrow Road to play in Adam Drury&#x27;s testimonial match against Celtic, coming on in the 76th minute showing his trademark bursts of pace and skill. Former Celtic and Norwich striker John Hartson who was co-commentating on Setanta Sports claimed he looked fit and sharp enough still to be playing professionally.

===San Jose Earthquakes===
Huckerby moved to the United States joining Major League Soccer club, San Jose Earthquakes in July 2008. MLS rules at the time dictated that Toronto FC owned the right to sign Huckerby. To acquire those rights, San Jose traded allocation money and use of an international roster slot for the 2008 through 2013 seasons to Toronto.

He made his debut on 19 July 2008 against Toronto, in a 0–0 draw, and scored his first goal against New York Red Bulls on 27 July. In a crucial match for the Earthquakes, on 3 August 2008, Huckerby scored his second goal, against Los Angeles Galaxy, in a 3–2 Earthquakes win. On 30 August, he headed in the winning goal in the side&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Kansas City Wizards, extending San Jose&#x27;s unbeaten streak to seven games. During this stretch, Huckerby notched three goals and three assists.

On 11 November 2008, it was announced that Huckerby had won the 2008 MLS Newcomer of the Year Award.

During the 2009 Major League Soccer season, Huckerby underwent surgery to eliminate his hip injury. However, on 16 September 2009, at age 33, Huckerby announced that he was &#x27;99% sure&#x27; of his retirement.

==International career==
Huckerby made one appearance with the England B team in 1998.

==Coaching career==
He is a former academy coach for the Under 16s at championship side Norwich City.

==Personal life==
Huckerby lives in Keswick, south Norfolk. His son Tom sits on the substitute bench for Wroxham.

After retiring from football in 2009, Huckerby returned to playing football in the Masters Tournament in June 2011 in which he scored 8 goals in the Yorkshire Masters for his old club Leeds United. In the Grand Masters final Huckerby added a further 6 goals to his tally, making him overall tournament golden boot winner with 14 goals. Leeds were overall runners up in the tournament, losing 8–3 to Rangers in the final.

On 14 April 2013, Huckerby played in a charity game at Lowestoft Town&#x27;s Crown Meadow ground. He played for the ex professionals against a select eleven which included students from Lowestoft College.

<doc id="1105607" wikidata="Q971558" url="?curid=1105607" title="Russian nobility">
<text>The Russian nobility or dvoryanstvo () arose in the Middle Ages. In 1914, it consisted of approximately 1,900,000 members, out of a total population of 138,200,000. Up until the February Revolution of 1917, the Russian noble estates staffed most of the Russian government and possessed a self-governing body, the Assembly of the Nobility.

The Russian word for nobility, &quot;dvoryanstvo&quot; derives from Slavonic &quot;dvor&quot; (двор), meaning the court of a prince or duke (&quot;knyaz&quot;), and later, of the tsar or emperor. Here, &quot;dvor&quot; originally referred to servants at the estate of an aristocrat. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the system of hierarchy was a system of seniority known as &quot;mestnichestvo&quot;. The word &quot;dvoryane&quot; described the highest rank of gentry, who performed duties at the royal court, lived in it (&quot;Moskovskie zhiltsy&quot;, &quot;Moscow dwellers&quot;), or were candidates to it, as for many boyar scions (&quot;dvorovye deti boyarskie&quot;, &quot;vybornye deti boyarskie&quot;). A nobleman is called a &quot;dvoryanin&quot; (plural: &quot;dvoryane&quot;). Pre-Soviet Russia shared with other countries the concept that nobility connotes a status or social category rather than a title. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the title of the nobleman in Russia gradually became a formal status, rather than a reference to a member of the aristocracy, due to a massive influx of commoners via the Table of ranks.

Many descendants of the former ancient Russian aristocracy, including royalty, saw their formal standing change to merchants, burghers, or even peasants, while people descended from serfs (like Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s father) or clergy (like in the ancestry of actress Lyubov Orlova) gained formal nobility.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The nobility arose in the 12th and 13th centuries as the lowest part of the feudal military class, which comprised the court of a prince or an important boyar. From the 14th century land ownership by nobles increased, and by the 17th century, the bulk of feudal lords and the majority of landowners were nobles. The nobles were granted estates out of State lands in return for their service to the Tsar, either for as long as they performed service or for their lifetime. By the 18th century, these estates had become private property. They made up the Landed army ()—the basic military force of Russia. Peter the Great finalized the status of the nobility, while abolishing the boyar title.

===Early modern era in Russia: westernization===

====Overview====
The adoption of the fashions, mannerisms, and ideals of Western Europe by the Russian nobility was a gradual process rooted in the strict guidelines of Peter the Great and the educational reforms of Catherine the Great. While cultural westernization was mostly superficial and restricted to court, it coincided with the efforts of Russian autocrats to link Russia to Western Europe in more fundamental ways – socially, economically and politically. However, Russia&#x27;s existing economic system, which lacked a sizable middle class and which relied heavily on forced labor, proved an insurmountable obstacle to the development of a free market economy. Furthermore, the lower classes (an overwhelming majority of the Russian population) lived virtually isolated from the upper classes and the imperial court. Thus, most of the nobility&#x27;s “western” tendencies were largely aesthetic and confined to a tiny proportion of the populace.

As different rulers ascended the throne in the 19th century, each figure brought a different attitude and approach to ruling the nobility. Yet, the cultural impact of Peter I and Catherine II was set in stone. Ironically, by introducing the nobility to political literature from Western Europe, Catherine exposed Russia&#x27;s autocracy to them as archaic and illiberal. While the nobility was conservative as a whole, a liberal and radical minority remained constant throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, resorting to violence on multiple occasions in order to challenge Russia&#x27;s traditional political system (see Decembrist Revolt, Narodnaya Volya).

====Before Peter the Great====
Although Peter the Great is considered to be the first westernized ruler of Russia, there were, in fact, contacts between the Muscovite nobility and Western Europe before his reign. Ivan III, starting in 1472, sent numerous agents to Italy to study architecture. Both Michael Romanov (1613–1645) and his son Alexis (1645–1676) invited and sponsored European visitors – mostly military, medical, and building specialists – who came to Moscow in foreign dress, speaking foreign languages. When the boyars began to imitate the westerners in dress and hairstyle, Tsar Alexis in 1675 and then Tsar Feodor in 1680 restricted foreign fashions to distinguish between Russians and outsiders,
but these were not effectively enforced until the 1690s.

====Under Peter the Great====
Peter the Great was, first and foremost, eager to do away with Russia&#x27;s reputation as an Asiatic land and to propel his new empire onto the political stage of Western Europe. One of the many ways he hoped to achieve this was by changing the upper-class culture; he believed that forcing selected features of western fashion, education, and language onto the nobility would hasten Russia&#x27;s rise to international prestige. In 1697, he began to send nobles on compulsory trips abroad to England, Holland, and Italy. While the Tsar primarily designed these expeditions for naval training, he also encouraged the noblemen to learn about the arts of the west. Furthermore, Peter prioritized sending Russian natives as opposed to foreign expatriates; he was intent on “breeding” a new nobility that conformed to western customs but represented the Slavic people as a whole. When the travelers returned to Moscow, Peter tested them on their training, insisting on further education for those whose accumulated knowledge was unsatisfactory. By 1724, he had established – for the purpose of scientific study and discovery – the Academy of Sciences, which he modeled after “the ones in Paris, London, Berlin, and other places”.

Peter&#x27;s westernizing efforts became more radical after 1698 when he returned from his expedition through Europe known as the Grand Embassy. Upon arriving Peter summoned the nobility to his court and personally shaved almost every beard in the room. In 1705 he decreed a beard tax on all men of rank in Moscow and ordered certain officers to seek out noble beards and shave them on sight. He only allowed peasants, priests, and serfs to retain the ingrained and religious Russian tradition of wearing beards, which the Orthodox populace considered an essential aspect of their duty to convey the image of God. He also reformed the clothing of the nobility, replacing the long-sleeved traditional Muscovite robes with European clothing. Beginning in 1699 the tsar decreed strict dress requirements borrowing from German, Hungarian, French and British styles, fining any noblemen who failed to obey. Peter himself, who usually wore German dress and had a trimmed mustache, acted as a prime example. While the nobility universally followed Peter&#x27;s fashion preferences at court, they greatly resented these styles, which they saw as blasphemous. Away from St. Petersburg, very few noblemen followed Peter&#x27;s guidelines and enforcement was lax.

Peter also demanded changes in mannerisms and language among nobles. To supply Russians with a basic set of “proper” morals and habits, he ordered publication of manuals on Western etiquette. The most popular of these was &quot;The Honourable Mirror of Youth or A Guide to Social Conduct Gathered from Various Authors&quot;, a compilation of rules of conduct from numerous European sources, initially published in St. Petersburg in 1717. He also encouraged the learning of foreign languages especially French, which was the foremost political and intellectual language of Europe at the time. For the nobility, these changes felt even more forced than fashion regulations. As with clothing, there was uniform acceptance of Western mannerisms at court but general disregard for them outside of St. Petersburg. Furthermore, when Westerners visited Peter&#x27;s court they found the image and personality of the courtiers to appear forced and awkward. Friedrich Christian Weber, a representative of Britain, commented in 1716 that the nobles “wear the German Dress; but it is easy to observe on many, that they have not been long used to it”.

====Between the Greats====
While none of the rulers in power from 1725 to 1762 focused as strongly on cultural westernization, Peter sparked a transformation that was now unstoppable. Through their education and travels, some members of the nobility began to understand the extent to which Russia lagged behind Western Europe in the complexity of their political and educational systems, their technology and economy. By 1750, the ideas of secularism, skepticism and humanism had reached sects of the elite class, providing some with a new worldview and giving Russia a taste of the Enlightenment, of which they had experienced little. While even the most educated of the nobility still supported the autocracy that upheld the feudal system on which they depended, some considered how to make it more representative and to improve the bureaucracy.

The period between Peter I and Catherine II represents gradual yet significant developments in western culture among the nobility. Empress Anna gave many privileges to the nobility. In 1730 she repealed the primogeniture law introduced by Peter the Great allowing the sub-division of estates. In 1736 the age at which nobles had to start service was raised from 15 to 20 and length of service was changed to 25 years instead of life and families with more than one son could keep one to manage the family estate. In 1726 Catherine I and in 1743 Empress Elizabeth further regulated noble dress in a Western direction. In 1755 also during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, advanced secondary schools and the University of Moscow were founded with curricula that included foreign languages, philosophy, medicine and law; the material was chiefly based on imported texts from the west. Most significantly Peter III freed the nobility from obligatory civil and military service in 1762, allowing them to pursue personal interests. While some used this liberty as an excuse to lead lavish lives of leisure, a select group became increasingly educated in Western ideas through schooling, reading, and travel. As before, these changes applied to few and represented a gradual shift in noble identity rather than a sudden or universal one. Marc Raeff in &quot;Origins of the Russian Intelligentsia&quot; has suggested this was not a noble victory but a sign the state didn&#x27;t need them as much now that they had plenty of trained officials.

====Catherine the Great====
When Catherine II ascended the throne, she quickly made her political and philosophical opinions clear in the “Instruction” of 1767, a lengthy document which she prepared for the nobility, drawing largely from and even plagiarizing ideas from the west, especially those of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The point she emphasized first and foremost was that Russia was a truly European state, and her reforms of the court and education reflect this belief. While Catherine was primarily preoccupied with impressing westerners (especially the philosophers, with whom she corresponded in writing), in doing so she also made significant efforts to educate the nobility and expose them to western philosophy and art. She designed an imperial court in the style of Louis XIV, entertaining the nobility with performances of western theatre and music. She encouraged the understanding of French, German, and English languages so that nobles could read classic, historical, and philosophical literature from the west. For the first time in the history of the Russian court, “intellectual pursuits became fashionable”. When foreigners visited the court, Catherine expected the noblemen and their ladies to flaunt not only their western appearance but also their ability to discuss current events in western languages.

Catherine also made specific reforms in institutional education that pushed the nobility&#x27;s culture further westward. She based Russian education on that of Austria, importing German textbooks and adopting in 1786 a standardized curriculum to be taught in her newly created public schools. While many members of the lower classes were allowed into these schools, Catherine hoped that they could become educated enough to rise through the meritocratic Table of Ranks and eventually become nobles themselves. Catherine also established the Society for the Translation of Foreign Books, “to bring enlightenment to those Russians who could not read either French or German.” It is clear that, like Peter I, Catherine the Great desired to construct a new nobility, a “new race,” which would both resemble western noblemen and prove knowledgeable in discussions of modern issues. And, according to accounts from foreign visitors, the noblemen did, in fact, resemble those of Western Europe in their dress, topics of discussion, and taste in literature and performance.

She also gave away 66,000 serfs in 1762–72, 202,000 in 1773–93, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795. Thus she was able to bind the nobility to herself. From 1782, a kind of uniform was introduced for civilian nobles called uniform of civilian service or simply civilian uniform. The uniform prescribed colors that depended on the territory. The uniform was required at the places of service, at the Court, and at other important public places. The privileges of the nobility were fixed and were legally codified in 1785 in the Charter to the Gentry. The Charter introduced an organization of the nobility: every province (&quot;guberniia&quot;) and district (&quot;uezd&quot;) had an Assembly of Nobility. The chair of an assembly was called Province/District Marshal of Nobility. In 1831 Nicholas I restricted the assembly votes to those with over 100 serfs, leaving 21,916 voters.

===Late modern era===
By 1805 the various ranks of the nobility had become confused, as reflected in &quot;War and Peace.&quot; In the era of the Napoleonic Wars, there were counts who were wealthier and more important than princes and noble families whose wealth had been dissipated partly through lack of primogeniture, partly through extravagance and due to poor estate-management. Young noblemen served in the military but did not thereby acquire new landed estates. Tolstoy reported later improvements: some nobles paid more attention to estate management, and some, like Andrey Bolkonsky, freed their serfs even before the tsar did so in 1861. Of Russia&#x27;s nobles, 62.8% were szlachta from the nine western gubernii in 1858 and still 46.1% in 1897.
&quot;Obrok&quot; or cash rent was most common in the north while &quot;barshchina&quot; or labor rent was found mainly in the southern Black Earth Region. In the reign of Nicholas I (1825–1855) the latter brought three times the income of cash rent (though this needed less administration). In 1798 Ukrainian landlords were banned from selling serfs separately from land. In 1841 landless nobles were banned also.

Descended from the gentry, the landholding, but not serf-owning, odnodvortsy were between peasants and nobles. They emerged as frontier settlers recruited from the class of boyar scions. The status of the odnodvortsy changed gradually from singleholding farmers to taxed state peasants.

The nobility was too weak to oppose the Emancipation reform of 1861. In 1858, three million serfs were held by 1,400 landlords (1.4%) while 2 million by 79,000 (78%). In 1820 a fifth of the serfs were mortgaged, half by 1842. By 1859, a third of nobles&#x27; estates and two-thirds of their serfs were mortgaged to noble banks or to the state. The nobility was also weakened by the scattering of their estates, lack of primogeniture and the high turnover and mobility from estate to estate.

After the peasant reform of 1861 the economic position of the nobility weakened. The influence of the nobility was further reduced by the new law statutes of 1864, which repealed their right of electing law officer. The reform of the police in 1862 limited the landowners&#x27; authority locally, and the establishment of all-estate Zemstvo local government did away with the exclusive influence of nobility in local self-government.

These changes occurred despite the nobles keeping nearly all the meadows and forests and having their debts paid by the state, while the ex-serfs paid 34% over the market price for the shrunken plots they kept. This figure was 90% in the northern regions, 20% in the black-earth region but zero in the Polish provinces. In 1857, 6.79% of serfs were domestic, landless servants who stayed landless after 1861. Only Polish and Romanian domestic serfs got land. Ninety percent of the serfs who got larger plots lived in the eight ex-Polish provinces where the Tsar wanted to weaken the Szlachta. The other 10% lived in Astrakhan and in the barren north. In the whole Empire, peasant land declined 4.1% - 13.3% outside the ex-Polish zone and 23.3% in the 16 black-earth provinces. Georgia&#x27;s serfs suffered the loss of of their land in Tiflis province, in Kutaisi province. These redemption payments were not abolished till January 1, 1907.

The influx of New World grain caused a slump in grain prices, forcing the peasants to farm more land. At the same time, despite their efficiency, large peasant households split up (from 9.5 to 6.8 persons per household in central Russia, 1861–1884). The resulting land hunger increased prices 7-fold and made it easier for nobles to sell or rent land rather than farm it themselves. From 1861 to 1900 40% of noble land was sold to peasants (70% of this went to the Commune and by 1900 two thirds of the nobles&#x27; arable land was rented to the peasantry). Between 1900–1914, over 20% of remaining noble land was sold but only 3% of the 155 estates over 50,000 &quot;destiny&quot;. According to the 1897 census, 71% of the top 4 ranks of the civil service were nobles. But in the civil service as a whole, noble membership declined from 49.8% in 1755 to 43.7% in the 1850s and to 30.7% in 1897. There were 1.2 million nobles, about 1% of the population (8% in Poland; compare with 4% in Hungary and 1 to 1.5% in France). Their military influence waned: in the Crimean War 90% of officers were noble, by 1913 the proportion had sunk to 50%. They lived increasingly away from their estates: in 1858 only 15 to 20% of Russian nobles lived in cities, by 1897 it was 47.2%.

By 1904 of noble land was mortgaged to the noble bank.
During the 1905 Russian Revolution 3,000 manors were burnt (15% of the total).
====Non-Russian nobility====

The Russian imperial nobility was multi-ethnic. Native non-Russians such as the Poles, Georgians, Lithuanians, Tatars, and Germans formed an important segment of the noble estate. The Baltic German nobility was particularly prominent. According to the 1897 census, 0.87% of Russians were classified as hereditary nobles versus 5.29% of Georgians and 4.41% of Poles, followed by Lithuanians, Tatars, Azerbaijanis, and Germans. After the abolition of serfdom, the non-Russian nobility, with the exception of Finland, lost their special status. Later, many of the impoverished or déclassé Polish and Georgian nobles became leaders of nationalist and radical political movements, including Bolshevism.

Quoting historian John Armstrong, Andrei Znamenski describes the Baltic Germans as a &quot;mobilized diaspora&quot; who acted as the Russian Empire&#x27;s cultural and diplomatic envoys.

====Russian Revolution, Soviet Union and White émigrés====
The nobility, members of which had played an active role in the February Revolution of 1917 and still occupied many positions in politics and state administration (e.g. Prince Georgy Lvov), was suppressed and abolished in the October Revolution by the new Soviet government run by the Bolsheviks with a decree of November 10/November 23, 1917. All classes of nobility ceased to exist as a class defined by state law.

The vast majority of wealthy and high-ranking nobles left Russia as &quot;White émigrés&quot; or fell victim to the Russian Civil War or the Red Terror by the Bolsheviks. Countless nobles died in the civil war after the October Revolution - in the White Army units there were entire regiments that consisted exclusively of noble officers. Others emigrated, especially to Switzerland, preferably to Geneva, to Poland, Germany and France, where Paris became the center of Russian emigrants (the “princely taxi drivers” were a stereotype there in the 1920s) and from there often to the USA, where a large part of the surviving members of the Imperial Family of Russia, the House of Romanov, and their descendants live today. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia quickly developed.

Under Bolshevik rule, many nobles were persecuted, imprisoned, tortured, and shot. Emperor Nicholas II and his family were banished to Yekaterinburg and murdered there. Thousands of dissidents, devout Christians, members of non-Russian peoples, communist officials and many nobles who remained in the Soviet Union later fell victim to the “purges” under Stalin. However, a significant number of the (mostly untitled) small nobility, who had inconspicuous names, had previously served as civil servants and mostly owned little land, came to terms with the circumstances. Some of them even took part in building the new state - such as Lenin himself, Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin as well as intelligence chief Felix Dzerzhinsky and his successor Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, both of whom came from Polish noble families; also Stalin&#x27;s secret service chief Vsevolod Merkulov, Marshals Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Konstantin Rokossovsky. Occasionally, members of prominent aristocratic families also adapted to the circumstances, either becoming Bolsheviks themselves, like the diplomat Leonid Leonidovich Obolensky (1873−1930), father of the actor Leonid Obolensky, or supporting the new system, like the writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy or the actor Mikheil Gelovani. Some married into the proletariat and the next, Soviet-influenced generation was accepted into the Soviet academic elite, such as Georgy Golitsyn, Vladimir Vladimirovich Golitsyn or Andrey Gagarin.

Many members of the Russian nobility who fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution played a significant role in the White Emigre communities which settled in Europe, in North America, and in other parts of the world. In the 1920s and 1930s, several Russian nobility associations were established outside Russia, including groups in France (the &quot;Union de la Noblesse Russe (UNR)&quot; is a member organization of CILANE), Belgium, and the United States. In New York, the Russian Nobility Association in America, was founded in 1933.

====Russian nobility since 1991====
The number of descendants of noble families still living in Russia today is difficult to estimate after more than 70 years of communism, but with around 100 million inhabitants in 1917 it could be at least 50-60,000. While most of the descendants of the princely and comital houses have lived in western countries since the revolution, many members of lower-ranking families have remained in Russia.

After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, aristocratic associations and organizations that maintained noble traditions were permitted again in Russia, but the Russian nobility no longer exists as a social class. The historical noble families are known from the sources. However, in Russia, as everywhere in Europe, according to historical aristocratic law, the nobility was only passed on in the male line. The acceptance of descendants through the female line, which is contrary to tradition and is now practiced by some of the more recent associations, is therefore very controversial.

The various aristocratic associations have different opinions not only with regard to aristocratic law, but also with regard to the succession of the pretenders to the Russian tsar&#x27;s crown. Some see Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia as the legitimate heir to the throne, but she is not recognized by the other remaining branches of the Romanov family. In particular, she has come to terms with the new Russian elite around President Vladimir Putin and awards some historical dynastic orders of the Tsars and sometimes even newly created orders such as the &quot;Order of the Archangel Michael&quot; (founded in 1988) or the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Order of Saint Anastasia&quot; (founded in 2010) to their members. She even goes so far as to raise such people “to the nobility.” In 2007, she is said to have ennobled the former head of the Russian domestic secret service Federal Security Service (FSB), Nikolai Patrushev, who is considered one of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s closest confidants (and one of his possible successor candidates). Patrushev himself described the FSB employees in an interview as “our new nobility” because of their sense of dedicated service.

The aristocratic associations are therefore faced with the question of how to deal with such “new aristocrats”, who usually have no biographical or cultural connection to the traditional nobility, but are often historically connected to the CPSU or the KGB and are often influential. Some of these associations have taken this line and recognize such “nobility” as legitimate. Most, however, reject it, because Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna is neither the undisputed pretender to the throne nor does she - who is not a reigning monarch - have any constitutional authority to ennoble herself. Neither the Russian CILANE member association, the &quot;Union de la Noblesse Russe&quot; based in Paris, which largely consists of descendants of the “White Emigrants”, nor the Association of Baltic knighthoods, which unites the families of the Baltic-German enrolled nobility of the former Russian Empire, recognize Maria Vladimirovna or anyone else as holder of the throne with the power of ennoblement. However, the fact that influential “would-be nobles” make up a significant proportion of the members of the new Russian aristocratic associations leads to major conflicts within and between the Russian aristocratic associations. Since membership in the nobility is neither legally recognized nor protected, a large market for fake titles and coats of arms has developed since 1991. Supposedly original letters of nobility “from the Tsarist era” or confirmation diplomas from dubious associations can even be purchased on the Internet.

==Organization==
Nobility was transferred by inheritance or was bestowed by a fount of honour, i.e. the sovereign of the Russian Empire, and was typically ranked as per below, with those of the highest noble prestige ranked first.

* Ancient nobility (descendants from Middle Ages)
* Titled nobility:
** Prince (&quot;knyaz&quot; Князь): e.g. Prince Potemkin
** Count (&quot;graf&quot; Граф): e.g. Count Tolstoy
** Baron (&quot;baron&quot; Барон): e.g. Baron Pahlen
* Hereditary nobility: inherited by all legitimate male-line descendants of a nobleman 
* Personal nobility: granted for the life of the recipient only
* Estateless nobility: obtained without the grant of a landed estate

Unlike the ancient nobility, which was exclusively hereditary, the remaining classes of nobility could be acquired.

A newly designated noble was usually entitled to landownership. A loss of land did not automatically mean loss of nobility. In later Imperial Russia, higher ranks of state service (see Table of Ranks) were automatically granted nobility, not necessarily associated with land ownership.

Russian did not in general employ a nobiliary particle before a surname (as &quot;von&quot; in German or &quot;de&quot; in French); however, the Russian name suffix -skij which means “of” and is equal to “von” and “de” was used in many noble surnames especially topographic surnames as nobiliary particle. Russian noblemen were accorded an official salutation, or style, that varied by rank: &quot;your high born&quot; (), &quot;your high well born&quot; (), &quot;your well born&quot; (), etc. 

===Titled nobility===
Titled nobility () was the highest category: those who had titles such as prince, count and baron. The latter two titles were introduced by Peter the Great. A baron or count could be either proprietary (actual) (владетельный (действительный))—&quot;i.e.,&quot; who owned land in the Russian Empire—or titular (титулярный), &quot;i.e.,&quot; only endowed with a rank or title.

===Hereditary nobility===
Hereditary nobility () was transferred to wife, children, and further direct legal descendants along the male (agnatic) line. In exceptional cases, the emperor could transfer nobility along indirect or female lines, &quot;e.g.,&quot; to preserve a notable family name.

===Personal nobility===
Personal nobility () could, for instance, be acquired by admission to orders of knighthood of the Russian Empire. It was transferable only to the wife.

===Estateless nobility===
Estateless nobility () was nobility acquired by state service, but without a grant of land.

===Ancient nobility===
In addition, the ancient nobility () was recognised, descendants of Rurik, Gediminas and historical boyars and knyazes, &quot;e.g.,&quot; the Aminoffs, Shuyskies, Galitzins, Naryshkins, Khilkoffs, Gorchakovs, Belosselsky-Belozerskys and Chelyadnins.

===Privileges===

Russian nobility possessed the following privileges:

* The right to own estates populated with estate-tied serfs (until 1861), including virtual ownership of the serfs who worked on the estates.
* Style, that varied by rank: &quot;The High Born&quot; (), &quot;The High and Well Born&quot; (), &quot;The Well Born&quot; (), etc. 
* Freedom from compulsory military service (1762–1874; later compulsory military service was introduced which did not exempt the nobility).
* The right to enter specially designated educational institutions, such as Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, Imperial School of Jurisprudence and Page Corps.
* Freedom from corporal punishment.
* The right to bear and use a coat of arms, introduced by the end of the 17th century.

=== Noble titles of the Russian Empire ===
The Russian Tsardom came into being around the Grand Duchy of Moscow by the incorporation of various political entities surrounding it. After Peter the Great returned from his grand tour he implemented reforms aimed at westernization of his realm, including officially adopting the title of Emperor of All Russia, preceding the traditional Slavic title of Tsar. Peter and his successors also streamlined the stratification of the Russian nobility, adopting European-style titles such as Count and Baron and discontinuing the archaic titles of Boyars. The Russian system of noble titles evolved into its final form:
===Acquisition===
Hereditary nobility could be achieved in the following ways: 1) by Imperial grant to individuals or families; 2) by attaining a certain military or civil officer&#x27;s rank while in active service; 3) by being awarded an order of chivalry of the Russian Empire.

Between 1722 and 1845 hereditary nobility was given to military officers who achieved the 14th rank of ensign, to civil servants who achieved the 8th rank of Collegiate Assessor and to any person who was awarded any order of the Russian Empire (since 1831 – except the Polish order of Virtuti Militari).

Between 1845 and 1856 hereditary nobility was given to military officers who achieved the 8th rank of major/captain 3rd rank, to civil servants who achieved the 5th rank of State Councillor and to any person who was awarded the Order of Saint George or the Order of Saint Vladimir of any class, or any order of the Russian Empire of the first class.

From 1856 to 1917 hereditary nobility was given to military officers who achieved the 6th rank of colonel/captain 1st rank, to civil servants who achieved the 4th rank of Active State Councillor and to any person who was awarded the Order of Saint George of any class or the Order of Saint Vladimir of any class (since 1900 - of the third class or higher), or any order of the Russian Empire of the first class.

Personal nobility could be acquired in the following ways: 1) by Imperial grant; 2) by attaining the 14th military rank of ensign or the 9th civil rank of Titular Councillor; 3) by being awarded the orders of the Russian Empire unless those gave hereditary nobility; except merchants (unless those were awarded between 1826 and 1832), who acquired honorary citizenship instead. Personal nobility was not inherited by children but was shared by the recipient&#x27;s wife.

<doc id="1105623" wikidata="Q3109612" url="?curid=1105623" title="Inclusivism">
<text>Inclusivism is one of several approaches in religious studies, anthropology, or civics to understand the relationship between different religions, societies, cultures, political factions etc. It asserts that there is beauty in the variety of different schools of thoughts, and that they can coexist. It stands in contrast to exclusivism, which asserts that only one way is true and all others are erroneous.

Within religious studies and theology, inclusivism is the belief that, although only one belief system is true, aspects of its truth can be found in other religions. This is contrasted from religious pluralism, which asserts that all beliefs are equally valid within a believer&#x27;s particular context.

Broadly speaking, there are two schools of Inclusivist thought:
* Relativistic inclusivism, which asserts that the believer&#x27;s own views are true only in their particular context, and believers of other traditions have their own validity.
* Absolutist inclusivism, which asserts that an unknown set of assertions are Absolutely True, that no human being currently living has yet ascertained absolute truth, but that all human beings have partially ascertained absolute truth.

== By religion ==
=== Ancient Greece ===
Interpretatio graeca was the tendency of ancient Greek writers to equate foreign divinities to members of their own pantheon. Herodotus, for example, refers to the ancient Egyptian gods Amon, Osiris, and Ptah as &quot;Zeus,&quot; &quot;Dionysus,&quot; and &quot;Hephaestus,&quot; respectively. This could be seen as an example of inclusivism as well as syncretism.

Syncretism functioned as an essential feature of Ancient Greek religion. Later on, Hellenism, a consequence of Alexander the Great&#x27;s belief that he was the son of a god, reinforced by the Oracle of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa in Egypt, itself showed syncretic features, essentially blending Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan-Roman) elements within Hellenic formulations. After the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, Isis became known as &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; and was worshipped in many aspects and by many names besides that of Hera.

=== Hinduism ===
A well-known hymn in the Hindu Rigveda claims that &quot;Truth is One, though the sages know it variously&quot;, proclaiming a pluralistic view of religion. Krishna, an Avatar of Vishnu, the supreme deity in Vaishnavism, said in the Gita, &quot;In whatever way men identify with Me, in the same way do I carry out their desires; men pursue My path... in all ways&quot; (Gita 4:11). He also said that &quot;Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me&quot; (Gita 7:21–22). Another quote in the Gita states: &quot;O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., Devas, for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe&quot; (Gita 9:23).

=== Christianity ===

Inclusive Christianity, also called inclusive theology, is an interpretation of the Bible that maintains that God desires and has the power to save individuals irrespective of the tradition in which they are born. Some Christian supporters of the inclusive view make a distinction between Christians and believers in maintaining that all Christians are believers. However, not all believers are Christians. In this line of thought, Christians are believers in the universal truth and follow and confess it under the biblical name &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. At the same time, they argue, some non-Christian believers of other religions, traditions, and disciplines would partially trust in the same one and only truth but under a different linguistic name. Inclusive Christians support these claims by citing certain passages from the Bible. Inclusive theology is rooted in a wider movement called &quot;interfaith&quot; that aims to create unity among various religions. The inclusive interpretation is a minority view in some churches but is considered an official theological doctrine in others.

Christian supporters of inclusivism include Augustus Hopkins Strong, C. S. Lewis, Clark Pinnock, Karl Rahner, John E. Sanders, Terrance L. Tiessen, and Robert Brush (contributor to &quot;The Arminian Magazine&quot;). While Billy Graham mostly preached &quot;salvation by faith in Christ alone&quot; throughout his 60-year ministry as an evangelist, he later made controversial comments that bordered on inclusivism. He stated that he did not like to refer to it by that term because he was concerned that many people mean universalism when they refer to inclusivism. Graham said, &quot;I used to play God but I can’t do that any more. I used to believe that pagans in far-off countries were lost and were going to Hell—if they did not have the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to them. I no longer believe that,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;I believe that there are other ways of recognizing the existence of God—through nature, for instance—and plenty of other opportunities, therefore, of saying ’yes’ to God.&quot;

Some Evangelical and Reformed Protestant scholars believe that God judges all people based on their response to the Holy Spirit, citing Romans 2:14–15 as evidence that those following a natural moral law are still following God. Some interpret this text more inclusively, suggesting that non-Christians also inherently possess a part of God&#x27;s wisdom in their hearts as an integral aspect of who they are. They interpret Genesis 20:9–11 and 1 Corinthians 5:1 to illustrate that there are non-Christians or non-Jews who, guided by their inherent understanding of God&#x27;s law, may lead lives that are more pleasing to God than those of some Jews and Christians. By Romans 1:19–20, inclusive Christians often argue that this description would imply that God—in parts—can be recognized by any human being, no matter their religion or cultural background, as well as independent from its geographic and/or its chronologic whereabouts. This would also include the domain of modern science as it studies the universe, as implied in Psalm 19:2–5. Other verses cited as supporting inclusivism include Acts 17:23–28, wherein Paul says that the (pagan) Greeks had been worshiping God without knowing it and that their poets have partially recognized the true nature of God. Inclusive Christians from various denominations argue that Colossians 1:16 suggests the universe, in its creatureliness, is part of God&#x27;s being and integral to the eternal reality of the Christ. Another Christian Biblical proof text inclusive believers use is Acts 10:1–48, which would state that whoever fears God and does good works is accepted by him, regardless of nation. In addition, the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25:31–46) portrays the judgment of the nations as being based on each individual&#x27;s compassion toward others, not on their religious background. It is often argued that the connection between the biblical verses in Genesis 2:7 and Genesis 7:21-22 serves as strong evidence that every living organism contains essential elements of the living God within itself, specifically through the breath of God.

Inclusive interpretations of the Christian Bible, as understood by many inclusive Christians, suggest that God can be experienced in other religions and disciplines, such as science. However, these interpretations typically emphasize that to experience a deep and intimate relationship with God, connecting with the person of Jesus and acknowledging the reality of the &quot;Logos&quot; is essential. Furthermore, they assert that a complete relationship with God involves recognizing Jesus&#x27;s and God&#x27;s inclusive and universal nature. This encompasses a personal relationship with Jesus and an understanding of the broader, inclusive concept of divinity.

The doctrine of inclusivism is held by Unitarian Universalism, a liberal religion with Christian origins, some Roman Catholics and Seventh-day Adventists, asserting that while Christianity is the &quot;one true faith&quot;, other faiths are at least partially true.

An alternative use for the term &quot;inclusive theology&quot; has to do with a movement called feminist theology, which aims to include more women in religious clergy roles that have been historically unavailable to women.

From an inclusive theological perspective, it is believed that a faith community can nurture the development of corresponding religious, spiritual, ecclesiastical, and interdisciplinary institutions. Examples of this are the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the Pontifical Council for Culture, or the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue. In all Catholic Church institutions, relationships with other disciplines and religions are nurtured due to the Bible&#x27;s fundamental inclusivist theological understanding.

<text>Gato Fedorento (; &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;) is a Portuguese surreal comedy group, known for their subjective and absurd satire centering both on the Portuguese language and the Portuguese social reality. The group is composed of the four comedians José Diogo Quintela, Miguel Góis, Ricardo Araújo Pereira and Tiago Dores. They started their comedy careers as screenwriters, writing for other comedians, which later developed into their own television shows, radio programs, a talk show and several advertising campaigns. They have been credited with introducing and popularizing the surreal humour genre in Portugal and are one of the most important influences in the modern Portuguese comedy. Their humour is heavily influenced by Monty Python.

&quot;Gato Fedorento&quot;, their homonym television show, ran for nine seasons. In its original unique surreal humour, the group is known for overusing Portuguese idioms, especially in indirect speech, within current discourse on their sketches, turning apparently objective quotidian situations into subjective and often illogical ones. Season names during the first four seasons were meant to satirically represent typical Portuguese surnames and are used as a last name for every single character in every episode of the show within their respective seasons. They also use satirical fictional city names that sound like realistic traditional Portuguese villages, often by including altered forms of Portuguese slang, in the same fashion as in the case of the surnames that give the name to the different seasons.

Currently, they have an exclusivity advertisement agreement with Portugal Telecom of unspecified duration, that spans multiple mediums, being the brand ambassadors.

==History==
The four screenwriters worked at the Portuguese production company Produções Fictícias, where they worked with some of the big names in the Portuguese comedy, like Herman José and Maria Rueff.
In 2002, they started delivering their own material in the show &quot;O Perfeito Anormal&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Dork&quot;) on SIC Radical. Their success in that role led the then director of SIC Radical, Francisco Penim, to invite them to create their own show.

Meanwhile, in 2003, they created an homonym weblog where they regularly presented some of their material. When they were deciding how to name the group, they chose it after the song &quot;Smelly Cat&quot;, from the soundtrack of &quot;Friends&quot;, which translates as &quot;Gato Fedorento&quot; in Portuguese. In the same year, &quot;Gato Fedorento&quot;, their homonym television show, premiered on SIC Radical, running for three seasons, the &quot;Fonseca Series&quot;, the &quot;Meireles Series&quot; and the &quot;Barbosa Series&quot;.

In 2006, after moving their show to RTP1, the fourth season, &quot;Lopes da Silva&quot;, premiered with moderate success. The fifth season, titled &quot;Diz que é uma Espécie de Magazine&quot; (lit. &quot;It&#x27;s a sort of talk show&quot;), a talk show with live audience, brought a significant change in the show&#x27;s format, with sketches now spoofing current events and news, instead of relying on subjective and surreal gags. In this new format, they also do impressions of Portuguese politicians and celebrities, mostly played by Ricardo Araújo Pereira, with the most spoofed being José Sócrates, Valentim Loureiro, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Paulo Bento. The sixth and seventh seasons were the last television shows made by &quot;Gato Fedorento&quot; on RTP1.

After returning to SIC in 2008, now on the flagship channel, the group kept the new format and made their eighth season, &quot;Zé Carlos&quot;. Their ninth and last season, &quot;Gato Fedorento Esmiúça Os Sufrágios&quot;, ran for 30 episodes, broadcast live from Monday to Friday, covering the 2009 Portuguese elections, featuring guests from the world of politics.
The group has released a DVD with the &quot;Fonseca&quot; season and performed live all over Portugal, being a huge success and breaking all DVD sale records in the country. In late 2005, they released another DVD with the &quot;Meireles&quot; season. The first three seasons still air on SIC Radical, as reruns.

<doc id="1105634" wikidata="Q924944" url="?curid=1105634" title="Luna Park (Coney Island, 1903)">
<text>Luna Park was an amusement park that operated in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, United States, from 1903 to 1944. The park was located on a site bounded by Surf Avenue to the south, West 8th Street to the east, Neptune Avenue to the north, and West 12th Street to the west. Luna Park was located partly on the grounds of the small park it replaced, Sea Lion Park, which operated between 1895 and 1902. It was the second of the three original, very large, iconic parks built on Coney Island; the others were Steeplechase Park (1897, by George C. Tilyou) and Dreamland (1904, by William H. Reynolds). At Coney Island&#x27;s peak in the middle of the 20th century&#x27;s first decade, the three amusement parks competed with each other and with many independent amusements.

Luna Park&#x27;s co-founders Frederic Thompson and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy had created the &quot;A Trip To The Moon&quot; ride, which had been highly popular during the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, and operated at Steeplechase Park in 1902. Luna Park opened on May 16, 1903, and was highly profitable until Dundy died in 1907. Thompson operated the park alone until 1912, when his lease was canceled. The Luna Amusement Company owned the park from 1911 to 1939; during the Great Depression, creditors foreclosed on Luna Park twice. The park was leased to a syndicate in 1940 and continued to operate during World War II. Over the years, the park&#x27;s owners constantly added new attractions and shows.

The park&#x27;s western half was destroyed by a fire in August 1944 and never reopened, while the eastern half closed in September 1944. Although some rides on Surf Avenue continued to operate after 1944, much of the site remained closed for several years; the area was redeveloped as the Luna Park Houses between 1958 and 1962. Though another amusement park opened nearby in 2010 and was named Luna Park to commemorate the original, it is unrelated to the 1903 park.

==Development==
Between about 1880 and World War II, Coney Island was the largest amusement area in the United States, attracting several million visitors annually. Sea Lion Park opened in 1895 and was Coney Island&#x27;s first amusement area to charge entry fees; this, in turn, spurred the construction of George C. Tilyou&#x27;s Steeplechase Park in 1897, the neighborhood&#x27;s first major amusement park.

=== Background ===
In 1901, Frederic Thompson and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy created a wildly successful ride called &quot;A Trip To The Moon&quot; as part of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York. The name of the fanciful &quot;airship&quot; (complete with flapping wings) that was the main part of the ride was &quot;Luna&quot;, the Latin word for the moon. The airship, and the park that was subsequently built around it, may have been named after Dundy&#x27;s sister in Des Moines, Luna Dundy Newman. George C. Tilyou invited Thompson and Dundy to move their attraction to Steeplechase for the 1902 season. The ride performed poorly during that season, which was extremely rainy. Thompson and Dundy opted to establish their own amusement park at the end of the season following a disagreement with Tilyou.


Thompson and Dundy agreed to take over the site of Paul Boyton&#x27;s 16-acre (6.5 ha) Sea Lion Park in August 1902. As part of the deal, they leased some land from Frederick Kister, and they also leased a strip of land on West 12th Street for 25 years. Sea Lion Park had several centerpiece rides, but low attendance during the 1902 season and competition with Steeplechase Park had prompted Boyton to leave the amusement park business. Thompson and Dundy also leased the adjacent site of the Elephantine Colossus Hotel, which had burned down in 1896. This gave them , all the land north of Surf Avenue and south of Neptune Avenue, between West 8th and West 12th Streets.

=== Construction and opening ===
Dundy was in charge of raising capital for the project, while Thompson was responsible for the park&#x27;s layout and architecture. &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; initially estimated that Thompson and Dundy would spend $200,000 renovating Sea Lion Park. Ultimately, the men spent $700,000 (although they advertised it as $1 million) totally rebuilding the park and expanding its attractions. Wall Street financiers and Coney Island speculators each contributed half the project&#x27;s cost. By November 1902, Thompson aimed to open the park by May 2 of the following year. Topsy the elephant, which Boyton had bought that season to add to the menagerie of animals at Sea Lion Park, was involved in demolishing some of the old rides. During an October event that involved Topsy hauling the airship &quot;Luna&quot; from Steeplechase to its new location, handler William Alt was arrested for disorderly conduct after assaulting the elephant with a pitchfork and then turning it loose to wander down Surf Avenue. In an organized publicity stunt, Thompson and Dundy announced they would hang Topsy and sell tickets to the event. Following an intervention from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Thompson and Dundy agreed to a more humane method of poisoning, electrocuting, and strangling the elephant in a smaller private affair that was captured in the short film &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot;. Thompson and Dundy ultimately electrocuted Topsy, then killed her using cyanide, in January 1903.

Thompson and Dundy planned to add new rides including a flower garden, a German village, and a Trip to the Moon attraction. The lagoon and the Shoot the Chute attraction were the only parts of Sea Lion Park to be retained. Early plans called for Luna Park to include a tower with 38,000 lights. The park&#x27;s original rides and attractions also included an infant incubator, a Shoot the Chute ride, a three-ring circus, and a Fire and Flames show that employed over a thousand performers. Luna Park unofficially opened on April 5, 1903, with a live show. The same month, Leo Wyent and George M. Foley sued to prevent Thompson and Dundy from issuing a concession allowing a third party to sell cigars and alcoholic beverages at the park. Thompson and Dundy planned to sell alcoholic beverages at one location in the park, the German Village.

Calling itself &quot;the heart of Coney Island&quot;, Luna Park turned on its lights on May 16, 1903, at 8 p.m. The park&#x27;s gates opened five minutes later to a crowd of 45,000 guests. It featured 39 shows and initially contained 53 buildings. Admission to the park was ten cents. An additional fee was required for some rides, ranging up to 25 cents for the most elaborate attractions, although the park also hosted free shows. Luna Park was accessible from Culver Depot, the terminals of the West End and Sea Beach railroad lines. Its general manager D. S. Smith had arranged for the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) to operate express trains directly to Park Row Terminal in Manhattan during the park&#x27;s operating hours, terminating directly at Luna Park&#x27;s main entrance; this arrangement continued until 1909. The park was extremely popular, recording 142,000 guests on Independence Day in 1903. Thompson and Dundy had recovered 90 percent of Luna Park&#x27;s construction cost less than three months after its grand opening. 
== Operation ==

=== 1900s ===
Because of the success of Luna Park, competition for visitors ramped up on Coney Island. Former state senator William H. Reynolds announced plans in July 1903 to build a hippodrome rivaling Luna Park, and Reynolds opened a third large-scale park, Dreamland, the next year. Reynolds wanted Dreamland to surpass Luna Park in every way. As such, Dreamland featured several times as many lights as Luna Park, an even bigger central tower, more refined architecture, and (according to one source) more &quot;high-class entertainment&quot;. At Coney Island&#x27;s peak in the mid-1900s, Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park competed with each other and with many independent amusements. Dreamland survived until 1911,when it was destroyed in one of the many fires common on Coney Island during the early 20th century.

Thompson and Dundy were constantly changing the park&#x27;s attractions. Ahead of the 1904 season, Thompson and Dundy expanded Luna Park by , bringing its total area to . The expansion included replicas of additional locales, a Japanese tea garden, a replica of a Himalayan mountain above the Coney Island Creek, and a $250,000 reproduction of the Delhi Durbar. Thompson and Dundy also added several shows, including &quot;Night and Morning&quot; and a series of pageants hosted on a stage. A second deck was added around the central lagoon, increasing the park&#x27;s capacity by 70,000. George Kessler of the Sea Beach Land Company agreed to buy the land under Luna Park in June 1904 for over $1 million; the sale did not affect Thompson and Dundy&#x27;s lease. Kessler initially took an option on the site; he decided to exercise his option in September 1904. At the time, Luna Park had already accommodated two million guests.

For the 1905 season, L. A. Thompson (who was not related to Fred Thompson) added a scenic railway-style roller coaster to Luna Park, replacing the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea attraction. Luna Park added several shows ahead of the 1906 season, in addition to two slides. Dundy died in early 1907, leaving Fred Thompson as the sole operator of Luna Park. &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; said Dundy&#x27;s death &quot;was a severe blow to Mr. Thompson&quot;. Nonetheless, Thompson continued to add to the park, employing four elephants and 700 men during the off-season. For the 1907 season, Thompson added a carousel called the Ocean Wave; in addition, he expanded the ballroom and lagoon, and he relocated the entrance away from the elevated train lines.

Coney Island had reached its peak popularity by the late 1900s. The park employed over 2,000 people each season, and it accommodated five million guests a year. The park had sold 31 million tickets in its first five seasons, leading Thompson to say in early 1908: &quot;I believe this surpasses everything in the history of amusement enterprises anywhere in the world.&quot; Some of the attractions were replaced with ten live shows during the 1908 season, including &quot;Trip to the Moon&quot;. Thompson added another live show in 1909, and he also continued to offer novelties, including elephant rides (which attracted guests such as actor Douglas Fairbanks). That year, New York City mayor George B. McClellan Jr. attempted to prevent the park from staging live shows on Sundays, claiming that the shows were illegal; a New York Supreme Court justice granted an injunction in July 1909, allowing Luna Park to host shows on Sundays.

=== 1910s ===

By October 1910, the New York State Banking Department wanted to place Luna Park into receivership because the firm of Thompson and Dundy had gone bankrupt. However, the park&#x27;s lawyers contended that the firm was no longer in control of Luna Park. A New York Supreme Court justice ultimately declined to appoint a receiver for the park. For the 1911 season, Thompson added attractions and shows such as Sinking of the Maine and the Monkey Music Hall. The Luna Amusement Company, headed by Barron Collier, took over the park about the same year. The park&#x27;s scenery-storage building, a restaurant, and two rides burned down in a large fire in December 1911, several months after Dreamland&#x27;s destruction, although the rest of the park remained undamaged. Thompson ran Luna Park until March 1912, when the Sea Beach Land Company and Charles C. Overton moved to evict Thompson; the eviction was finalized the next month. For the 1912 season, the new operators added attractions such as the Kiss Waltz and the Turkey Trot.

Thompson left for San Francisco in 1913, and Oscar Jurney was appointed as the new general manager, working at Luna Park until the end of 1917. For the 1913 season, the new operator added various attractions, including a show called Fire and Sword, as well as two mechanical rides. The following season, the operators added a dancing pavilion and numerous other attractions such as a diving tank. The dance pavilion was so popular that a second level was constructed prior to the 1915 season, and the park began screening movies the same season. Also during the 1915 season, the park&#x27;s managers added an &quot;Oriental Village&quot;, featuring Arab, Egyptian, and Turkish villagers, and a &quot;village of midgets&quot;, featuring little people.

Before the 1917 season, the Luna Park Amusement Company acquired additional land, which was used as a parking lot. In addition, the park&#x27;s managers installed the Top, a massive steel structure that was designed to resemble a spinning top. The toboggan and burro rides were destroyed in a fire in August 1917, and a set for a mountain range burned down in March 1918. As a result of the first fire, the toboggan and burro rides were rebuilt. During the 1918 season, Luna Park&#x27;s managers added several attractions about World War I, including a simulated battlefield. The next year, Luna Park installed more war-related attractions, and Henry Miller was appointed as the park&#x27;s general manager. The park also added shows such as the Darktown Follies and A Trip to Me-Lo-Die, as well as attractions including the Frolic, Over the Top (a variant of the Virginia Reel), the Tanks, and Treat-&#x27;em-Rough.

=== 1920s ===
For the 1920 season, the park&#x27;s managers added several funhouse-style attractions, including a tall slide and a children&#x27;s figure-eight slide. The park also added novelties such as the Pig Slide, a Shoot the Chute-style attraction that featured small pigs rather than people. The park&#x27;s shows during the early 1920s included China&#x27;s Fairy Fountains, a monkey orchestra, dancing ponies, and trained leopards. Luna Park added more shows in 1922, such as trained lions, trained tigers, &quot;Skia the Perfect Woman&quot;, and &quot;Trip to China&quot;. By 1923, the park had over 100 attractions, including nine theaters and 23 rides. The opening of the Riegelmann Boardwalk, the same year, caused patronage at Luna Park to increase. Arthur Jarvis was appointed as the park&#x27;s general manager in 1924. Under Jarvis&#x27;s management, the park added a roller coaster called the Sky Chaser, and it built a picnic grove, a grandstand, and an athletic field. In addition, two entrances to Luna Park were constructed to serve the new attractions. During the same season, actress Mary Pickford sponsored the construction of a play area for children who had gotten lost. Jarvis soon made further changes, including replacing the carousel and installing the Custer Cars, Skooter, and Tumblebug rides.

The 1925 season saw the addition of a Samoan village, an Egyptian village, and a wild-west show. Shows such as hula performances and the Charleston Chateau were added during the 1926 season, at which point the park was expanded to . In addition, the park added a saltwater swimming pool in 1926. Herbert Evans, the park&#x27;s longtime amusement manager, was rehired in 1928 and immediately announced plans for additional rides at Luna Park. Evans indicated that he would reduce the park&#x27;s admission fees, relocate several shows to Surf Avenue, give four free-admission shows per day, and replace the underused athletic field with a parking lot. The park spent $250,000 on improvements ahead of the 1929 season, installing attractions such as a court of nations.

=== 1930s ===

Ahead of the 1930 season, Luna Park&#x27;s managers installed a large cyclorama depicting Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s Antarctic base, and they installed a Lindy-Loop ride. Rex D. Billings was appointed as the park&#x27;s general manager the following year. For the 1931 season, the park added attractions like a Dodge &#x27;Em ride, a dark ride called the Pretzel, and a South Pole panorama. Luna Park struggled financially in the early 1930s, having been unable to profit from children&#x27;s rides, cockroach racing, marionette shows, or roller skating. To attract visitors, Luna Park reduced admission fees for many attractions. During the Great Depression, three of the park&#x27;s creditors filed a bankruptcy petition against Luna Park in 1933, asking a federal court to place the park into receivership. The proceeding was a friendly receivership, which allowed the Luna Amusement Company to continue operating the park. At the time, the park reportedly had $1.25 million in liabilities and had incurred a net loss during the preceding three seasons.

Billings made several modifications to the park before the 1933 season, including installing a skating rink in the Fun House and adding a beer garden. Every year, Luna Park had traditionally opened on the Saturday closest to May 15, but the receivership proceeding had delayed the opening of the 1933 season by one month. Most of Luna Park was closed during 1934, amid a poor season for Coney Island&#x27;s amusement-ride industry; half of the rides were gated off, and the park did not host any live shows. Prior to the beginning of the 1935 season, the park&#x27;s operators added a variety of rides and attractions, spending $70,000 in total. The manager, Charles R. Miller, reported that Luna Park&#x27;s revenue during 1935 was at its highest level in six years, in part because of the presence of new basketball and handball courts, a large swimming pool, and new shows.

Luna Park&#x27;s operators added more attractions during 1937, including two funhouses and an assortment of flat rides, but they were unable to compete with Coney Island&#x27;s beach, which charged no admission and was consequently more popular among travelers. The following year, Miller added vaudeville shows and replaced the Streets of Paris attraction with a concert space called Willow Green. Collier owned the park until his death in March 1939. The park had gone into receivership the prior month when the Prudence Bonds Corporation foreclosed on a $400,000 mortgage that was placed on the park. Jack and Irving Rosenthal, operators of Palisades Amusement Park, considered taking over Luna Park at that time. The park ultimately reopened in June 1939 after Harry Meinch, Silvio Pinto, and Walter Burgess leased Luna Park from its creditors. For the previous two seasons, only a small section of the park was open to the public.

=== Early 1940s ===

Milton Sheen, the park&#x27;s manager, announced plans in early 1940 to renovate Luna Park for $100,000. Later that year, Sheen announced plans to relocate at least eight attractions from the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair after the fair closed. Prior to the 1940 season, a syndicate composed of Edward and Harry Lee Danziger, William Miller, and Sheen took over the park, signing a ten-year lease in December 1940. At the end of that month, Miller announced plans to relocate 15 attractions from the World&#x27;s Fair to Luna Park. The plans also included a building for commercial exhibits, a swimming pool, a ballroom, and live shows. Luna Park&#x27;s managers ultimately spent $9 million to rebuild the park and install new attractions. Even after the United States entered World War II, Luna Park was allowed to open for the 1942 season, but the park had to keep its lights dimmed for wartime security. Miller continued to operate the park for the 1943 season while his partners, the Danzigers, served in the United States Army. Despite wartime restrictions and increased ticket prices, Luna Park remained popular.
Several concessions were damaged in a fire in February 1944, but most of the park remained untouched. After weeks of negotiations, Miller and the Danziger brothers agreed to purchase Luna Park from Prudence Bonds on August 3, 1944. The cost was estimated at $275,000; the price included a $125,000 purchase-money mortgage. Miller planned to renovate the park for the 1945 season and rename it Bill Miller&#x27;s Luna Park. Miller and the Danzigers were not scheduled to take title until September 15.

== Destruction ==

=== Fire and aftermath ===
A fire on August 13, 1944, destroyed much of Luna Park, causing $800,000 in damage. Among the attractions destroyed in the fire were the Dragon&#x27;s Gorge, the Mile Skyway roller coaster, the Coca-Cola tower, and various games and flat rides. The western half of the park was destroyed, but the main entrance, administration building, swimming pool, and other rides near the park&#x27;s entrance were not seriously damaged. The undamaged part of Luna Park reopened on August 18 and continued to operate until September 15, 1944. Before the fire, the park&#x27;s business had suffered due to declining patronage and a lack of new attractions. The few rides that survived the fire also operated during the 1945 season, but the interior of the park remained closed. During that season, Prudence Bonds leased the rides along Surf Avenue to Abe Siskin, Phil Pates, and Chick Guelfi, who renovated the Ole Opry House attraction into a music hall called Little Old New York.

In the two years after the fire, legal disputes ensued over the park&#x27;s insurance payout, which amounted to $152,000 and was paid to Prudence Bonds. Miller filed several lawsuits, including one to evict Prudence Bonds, who he claimed had illegally leased the attractions on Surf Avenue to Siskin, Pates, and Guelfi. The Brooklyn Municipal Court initially ruled that Prudence Bonds had to leave by July 1, 1945, but the ruling was overturned on appeal in August 1945. The New York Court of Appeals, in July 1946, awarded the park to the Danziger brothers for $135,000. The Danzigers immediately resold the park back to Prudence Bonds, estimating that it would cost $2 million to rebuild the site. The park&#x27;s interior remained closed, and some of the attractions had been sold or placed for sale, but the attractions on Surf Avenue were still operational.

=== Demolition and redevelopment ===
In August 1946, the park was sold to Morton S. Wolf and Associates. The buyers announced that they would tear down the interior of Luna Park and build housing for military veterans and their families. The plans called for 17 structures with a total of 625 three-and-four-room apartments. Wolf and Associates planned to preserve only the swimming pool, which was the only pool on Coney Island with a license to use ocean water. The rides along Surf Avenue, formerly part of Luna Park, were not included in the sale. That October, during Luna Park&#x27;s demolition, the remains of the park were damaged in another fire. During the 1947 operating season, Luna Park&#x27;s facade (including its entrance) was demolished and replaced with additional concessions. Despite Wolf and Associates&#x27; plans for the site, construction on the housing development never started. The remains of the park were visited only by &quot;youngsters at play&quot; and a fire inspector who visited once a week. Several minor fires further damaged the park. For instance, the remains of the Mile Skyway were destroyed in another fire in 1948.

Wolf continued to rent the rides on Surf Avenue to Siskin, Pates, and Guelfi until 1948, when Karl Klarnet took over operations. Wolf sold the Surf Avenue frontage to the Bonra Realty Company in July 1948. Bonra planned to replace the old buildings and entrance on Surf Avenue with two new structures for about $100,000. The park&#x27;s administration building on Surf Avenue remained vacant until May 1949, when it was also destroyed by a fire while being demolished. In January 1950, the eastern half of the site was sold again to Ball Park Movies Inc., which wanted to build a drive-in theater. By then, the site contained the remains of several rides, although all of the buildings had since been demolished. Fred Trump acquired the park&#x27;s eastern half from Ball Park Movies in October 1950, with the intention of constructing housing there. Trump bought the park&#x27;s western half, measuring , in 1953 for $625,000. This was one of several large residential developments being planned for Coney Island at the time. Trump had assembled a site, comprising not only the former Luna Park but also a strip of land stretching west to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue station.

Trump had wanted to obtain financing from the Federal Housing Administration, which withheld funding after federal officials indicted Trump on charges of profiteering in connection with a separate development. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) took over the site and announced in December 1955 that it would build a housing development for $200,000. The Coney Island Chamber of Commerce opposed the project, while the New York City Board of Estimate was in favor. To comply with the Board of Estimate&#x27;s requests, NYCHA revised its plan in early 1956 to exclude the attractions along Surf Avenue. The site was temporarily used as a public parking lot during the 1956 operating season and again in 1957. NYCHA took title to the site in November 1956 and began constructing the housing project in July 1958. The development was converted to a housing cooperative prior to its completion in 1962. A small part of the site, at Neptune Avenue and West 12th Street, was sold in 1960 and became a shopping center.

==Description==
Luna Park was bounded by Surf Avenue to the south, West 8th Street to the east, Neptune Avenue to the north, and West 12th Street to the west. Originally occupying , Luna Park was expanded to by 1904, then to by 1926. At its peak in the early 20th century, Luna Park employed hundreds of people and had its own police force, fire department, and clinic. Compared to the original Dreamland, the original Luna Park was smaller in scale but better organized, leading &quot;Town and Country&quot; magazine to say: &quot;The impression one takes from Luna Park is one of activity and extreme organization.&quot; Luna Park also differed from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which had inspired many of Coney Island&#x27;s earlier rides and was generally designed in a neoclassical style. According to author John F. Kasson, &quot;The Columbian Exposition preached discipline [while] Luna Park invited release&quot;, even though the buildings at both locations were made of plaster.

Fred Thompson designed the park&#x27;s buildings with elements from a variety of sources. Thompson did not want to use classical details, saying: &quot;It is marvelous what you can do in the way of arousing human emotions by the use that you make, architecturally, of simple lines&quot;. Generally, the buildings were designed in an Oriental style; many of the park&#x27;s architectural features were adapted from the Pan-American Exposition, including colonnades, loggias, porticoes, domes, and minarets. The park originally contained organic architectural details, such as dolphins (which were placed at the bottom of the park&#x27;s electric tower) and griffins (which were placed on the Dragon&#x27;s Gorge ride). Thompson also wanted the architectural elements to exude a feeling of luxury. Kasson and Michael Immerso characterized Luna Park&#x27;s design as being carnival-like, a deliberate effect intended to immerse visitors. Like Steeplechase Park, Luna Park was marketed as a family-friendly destination; Thompson dubbed it &quot;the place for your mother, your sister, and your sweetheart&quot;.

The park was initially illuminated at night by over 200,000 electric lights, installed on 132 towers and turrets; the lights changed color every second. Although Luna Park had far more light bulbs than Steeplechase Park, it was surpassed only a year later by Dreamland&#x27;s one million bulbs. Luna Park had over 600,000 electric lights by 1908, which was expanded yet again to 1.45 million lights by 1912. The lighting scheme contributed to Luna Park&#x27;s character and, according to Kasson, &quot;symbolized its topsy-turvy order&quot;.

=== Entrance and main court ===
The arched entrance on Surf Avenue was described in &quot;The Street Railway&quot; magazine as &quot;covering half of an entire city block&quot;, with four monolithic figures, one at each of its corners. The entrance gate contained five ticket kiosks, shaped like Roman chariots and staffed by &quot;young women dressed in evening attire and Merry Widow straw hats emblazoned with red feathers&quot;. A large avenue called the Court of Honor extended straight from the entrance and was surrounded by 53 buildings. There was a replica of Venice to the right of the court, which included a miniature Grand Canal with gondoliers, as well as a model of the Piazza San Marco. To the left of the Court of Honor were three large buildings, which featured the Trip to the Moon, War of Worlds, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea attractions. Other attractions, which housed various shows, the Grand Casino, and the Old Mill and Helter Skelter attractions, were placed alongside the Court of Honor.

At the center of the park in the middle of a lake was the 200-foot-tall (61 m) electric tower that was decorated with 30,000 incandescent lamps. Each of the tower&#x27;s four sides had 48 illuminated circles. The tower was inspired by another at the Pan-American Exposition, which had been twice as tall and illuminated by thousands of lights. The lagoon around the tower was bordered by a wide, brightly lit esplanade; there was also a lighted terrace with benches next to the lagoon. Two circus rings were suspended over the central lagoon to keep customers entertained between rides, and aerial shows were performed over the lagoon. In contrast to Dreamland, Luna Park generally had narrow pathways. When the park was particularly crowded, patrons were sometimes &quot;compelled to listen to the side show &#x27;barkers&#x27;&quot; to avoid the overcrowded paths, according to the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;.

=== Rides and attractions ===

Luna Park had many rides over the years. Among the attractions that opened in 1903 were Bridge of Laughs, an uneven-surface plank bridge; Midnight Express, a miniature railroad; Shoot the Chutes, a slide left over from Boynton&#x27;s Sea Lion Park; and Trip to the Moon, a roller coaster originally named Drop the Dip. One of Luna Park&#x27;s largest attractions was Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, a submarine ride simulating Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel of the same name. It was housed in a building and transported guests to a replica of an Eskimo village at the North Pole; the building included a tank measuring deep, and the temperature of the water changed as visitors traveled to different parts of the tank. The park&#x27;s other original attractions included Infant Incubators, a building displaying a new type of infant care. Canals of Venice, a gondola ride, was one of the original attractions, but did not open with the rest of the park.

Luna Park&#x27;s attractions were constantly changed over the years. The 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea attraction was replaced with a cyclorama in 1905, and Trip to the Moon was relocated in the 1910s before being moved back to Luna Park in 1924. Other rides added to Luna Park after its opening included:

*&quot;Buzzard&#x27;s Roost&quot; – a side-friction roller coaster designed by L. A. Thompson; added in 1904
*&quot;Daffy Dill &amp; Captain Thompson&#x27;s Wonder Ship&quot; – an attraction with a deep-sea monster; added in 1937
*&quot;Double Whirl&quot; – a set of six 72-person wheels attached to a turntable; added in 1906–1907
*&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gorge&quot; – a side-friction roller coaster consisting of a track in a building with a waterfall; added in 1905
*&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; – an adult slide with two chutes; added in 1906–1907
*&quot;Mountain Torrent&quot; – an early water coaster, which started atop an mountain and dropped down a series of cascades and ridges
*&quot;Old Mill&quot; – tunnel of love ride; adapted from the Babbling Brook, a water slide, circa 1904
*&quot;The Teaser&quot; – spinning wooden chairs; installed next to the electric tower in 1910
*&quot;The Tickler&quot; – large round tub that rolled downhill through a winding fence lined path; added in 1907
*&quot;The Top&quot; – a massive spinning wheel, which weighed , was wide, and traveled along a track. The ride was added in 1917 and removed after 1921.
*&quot;A Trip to Mars by Aeroplane&quot; – simulation of a Curtiss plane that traveled from Governors Island to Mars; added circa 1909
*&quot;Virginia Reel&quot; – a side-friction roller coaster with circular spinning cars that zigzagged down a track. Added in 1908, the ride was invented by the park&#x27;s superintendent Henry Elmer Riehl, who named it after his daughter.
*&quot;Witching Waves&quot; – small cars propelled by an undulating floor; added in 1907

=== Shows, exhibits, and other facilities ===
The park also had dozens of live shows over the years. Two park attendants maintained each show. When Luna Park opened, its shows included &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, a show that simulated enemy ships firing at a replica of Fort Hamilton; &quot;Professor Wormwood&#x27;s Monkey Theater&quot;, which showcased trained dogs, monkeys, and apes; &quot;The Kansas Cyclone&quot;, a theater show depicting a Kansas town being destroyed by a tornado; &quot;Fire and Flame&quot;, a simulated fire that employed a thousand performers; and &quot;Hagenbeck&#x27;s Wild Animals&quot;. The Durbar attraction, added in 1904, featured a 700-foot-wide stage that exhibited such &quot;dramatic spectacles&quot; as &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, &quot;Days of &#x27;49&quot;, &quot;The Burning of Prairie Belle&quot;, and &quot;Crack of Doom&quot;. Later additions included &quot;Fall of Adrianople&quot;, a show that depicted a besieged Turkish city. There were also various theatrical attractions, such as the Chinese Theater; by 1923, the park had nine theaters.

Within Luna Park was the Rath House, a German-style meeting hall that could accommodate 1,000 people and had a main ballroom, banquet rooms, and reception rooms. The park also contained the Grand Casino, along with the Court of Honor. The park hosted concerts, fireworks, and carnival performances as well. Luna Park also had a swimming pool that, in 1915, was cited as being capable of accommodating 5,000 bathers. Handball and basketball courts were also added after the 1935 season.

The park included multiple sections with small &quot;villages&quot; that housed members of various ethnic groups. For example, there was a &quot;Filipino village&quot;, featuring actual Filipino villagers who were brought to New York City, as well as &quot;Japanese, Eskimo, Singalese, and Hindu villages&quot;. There were also various sections dedicated to different parts of the world, including landscapes themed to Japan, Germany, and Ireland. According to the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, &quot;the villages of foreigners form centres of interest for many visitors to Luna Park&quot;. By 1904, the park also had replicas of Delhi, as well as a miniature Hanging Gardens of Babylon with 25,000 plants and 10,000 trees.

=== Reception ===
The day after the park opened in 1903, a reporter claimed that &quot;the brilliance and beauty and weirdness of it all beggars description&quot;. Soon afterward, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; wrote that the park was &quot;most completely electrically illuminated and most attractively laid out, while there is nothing to which the most fastidious visitor can take the least exception in the way the attractions are presented or attention is drawn to them&quot;. Russian author Maxim Gorky said of the park: &quot;With the advent of night, a fantastic city all of fire suddenly rises from the ocean into the sky&quot;, while another writer said that Luna Park&#x27;s skyline &quot;is utterly unlike anything else of its kind in the two Americas&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot; wrote in 1904 that &quot;people were at a loss for adjectives and exclamations to describe the City of the Moon last summer; they will be utterly swamped this year.&quot; Not all commentary was positive; art critic James Huneker said &quot;every angle reveals some new horror&quot; at Dreamland and Luna Park.

Luna Park&#x27;s electric tower inspired the construction of similar towers at Steeplechase Park and Dreamland. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described Luna Park and Dreamland in 1904 as the &quot;twin sisters of magnificence&quot;; the same magazine, in 1918, characterized Luna Park as a &quot;real World&#x27;s Fair&quot;. Luna Park became so closely associated with Coney Island&#x27;s amusements that, in 1921, the &quot;Standard Union&quot; called it &quot;the heart of Coney Island&quot;. In 1991, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Walter Goodman described Luna Park as &quot;a blazing architectural jumble, from Romanesque to Art Nouveau, alive with aerialists, tightrope walkers, jugglers and elephants.&quot; John Kasson wrote in 1978 that, similar to the ornate vaudeville theaters and movie palaces of the early 20th century, &quot;Luna appealed to popular notions of magnificence&quot;.

=== Media ===
Before the park opened, it was featured in the short silent comedy &quot;Rube and Mandy at Coney Island&quot;. The song &quot;Meet Me Down At Luna, Lena&quot; was recorded by Billy Murray in 1905 to promote the park, among others. Roscoe Arbuckle&#x27;s 1917 silent &quot;Coney Island&quot; featured Luna Park. The 1928 Oscar-nominated King Vidor movie &quot;The Crowd&quot; includes scenes filmed at Luna Park, and part of Harold Lloyd&#x27;s 1928 movie &quot;Speedy&quot; was also shot at the park.

=== Namesakes ===
The original Luna Park site contains a cooperative apartment complex called Luna Park Houses, completed in 1962. When built, the development contained five 20-story buildings with a total of 1,576 units, each with between one and three bedrooms. Each of the four buildings consists of four wings, which radiate from a core with three elevators and balconies on each floor.

Coney Island&#x27;s original Luna Park shares its name with dozens of parks around the world. Carroll Purcell wrote that the name was used by parks in such far-away locations as &quot;Japan to Australia, Egypt to Mexico [...] a chain in Saudi Arabia and a handful of parks in the republics of the former Soviet Union&quot;. Another namesake was Coney Island&#x27;s current Luna Park, which opened in 2010 at the former site of the defunct Astroland park, a parcel of land on the south side of Surf Avenue just across from the original Luna Park site. The newer park, operated by Zamperla, features an entrance patterned after the original Luna Park&#x27;s main gate.

<text>Craig Fleming (born 6 October 1971) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender. Fleming was first team assistant Coach at Premier League club Southampton, a position he held since 2018 until his departure in 2022.

==Playing career==
Fleming began his professional career with his hometown club Halifax Town (69 appearances, no goals) where he made his debut aged 16. He also picked up the Barclays Player of the Month award at the same age. In the summer of 1991 he moved to Oldham Athletic, where he made 192 appearances, scoring one goal. His spell at Oldham included three seasons in the top division in the early 1990s. In this period, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson described Fleming as &quot;the best man-to-man marker in the country&quot; after playing some memorable games against a young Ryan Giggs. In 1993, he was involved in Oldham Athletic&#x27;s great escape when they narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League on goal difference. He became captain of the Latics in 1997 which was also the season when he left Boundary Park for Carrow Road, the home of Norwich City for a fee of £600,000. In his first season with the Canaries he suffered some injury setbacks but this was soon behind him and he became a first team regular for nearly ten seasons. In this time he also had spells of captaining his team and was a well-respected member of the squad.

In 2003, Fleming was voted into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.

On 23 October 2004, he made his 300th senior appearance for Norwich City in their home match against Everton.

Fleming was a key figure in the Norwich side that won the first division championship in the 2003–2004 season, and the supporters recognised his outstanding contribution – not just during that season but over several years – by voting him Norwich City player of the year ahead of Darren Huckerby (2nd) and Robert Green (3rd). During Norwich&#x27;s Premiership season Fleming played every minute of every game, spending the most minutes on the pitch of any top flight player.

To mark the fact that the 2006–07 season was his tenth with the club, Norwich City granted Fleming a testimonial match against Newcastle United which took place at Carrow Road on 26 July 2006. This game finished 2–1 to Newcastle with Fleming playing for the majority of the game. In January 2007 Fleming joined Wolverhampton wanderers on a one-month loan deal and played once against . There was increasing speculation that AFC Bournemouth would attempt to sign Fleming during the January transfer window in 2007, but Rotherham United were the club to snap him up on a free transfer on 31 January.

Fleming signed for non-league King&#x27;s Lynn shortly after the start of the 2007–08 season, where he was under the management of former coach Keith Webb. On 12 March 2008, however. Fleming announced his retirement due to a persistent ankle injury.

Fleming ended his Norwich City career finishing 11th in the all-time appearance list after clocking up 382 appearances.

==Coaching career==
In 2008, Fleming joined Lowestoft Town as first-team coach guiding them to two successful promotion seasons. In the 2009–10 season they were promoted from Isthmian League Division One North to Isthmian League Premier Division. Subsequently, in 2014 Lowestoft were play off champions and promoted to the Conference league.

Fleming has finished studying his UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; licence.

In March 2015, he left Lowestoft Town and joined the Southampton F.C. Academy as under-18 coach. In 2018, Fleming was appointed First Team Assistant Coach at Premier League club Southampton, before his departure from the club in 2022.

In August 2023, Fleming joined the coaching staff at Derby County&#x27;s academy, taking up the role of Head of Academy Technical Development. 

In March 2024, Fleming left his role at Derby, taking up a new role as Ralph Hasenhüttl&#x27;s assistant coach at VfL Wolfsburg.

==Career outside football==
During his time at Norwich, Fleming became patron of two charities, The Matthew Project and Radio Broadland Kidz. During his testimonial season he held events to raise money for both charities, including a hike &#x27;n&#x27; bike around Norfolk in which he raised in excess of £23,000.

In January 2009, Fleming became an Ambassador for Sport in Norfolk. In this role he visits schools and other youth organisations to help encourage young people to achieve through hard work and dedication.

<doc id="1105658" wikidata="Q314182" url="?curid=1105658" title="Henry Allingham">
<text>Henry William Allingham (6 June 1896 – 18 July 2009) was an English supercentenarian. He is the longest-lived man ever recorded from the United Kingdom, a First World War veteran, and, for one month, the verified oldest living man in the world. He is also the second-oldest military veteran ever, and at the time of his death was the 12th-verified oldest man of all time.

Allingham was the oldest-ever surviving member of any of the British Armed Forces, and one of the last surviving veterans of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last-surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), and the last-surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force (RAF). In 2001, he became the face of the First World War veterans&#x27; association and made frequent public appearances to ensure that awareness of the sacrifices of the First World War was not lost to modern generations. He received many honours and awards for his First World War service and, towards the end of his life, his longevity.

==Early life==

Allingham was born on 6 June 1896 in Clapton, County of London. When he was 14 months old, his father, Henry Thomas Allingham (1868–1897), died at age 29 of tuberculosis. Henry is recorded in the 1901 census with his widowed mother Amy Jane Allingham (née Foster) (1873–1915), a laundry forewoman, living with her parents and brother at 23 Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow. His mother remarried in 1905 to Hubert George Higgs and in 1907 the family moved to Clapham, London. Henry and his mother are recorded in the 1911 Census living at 21 Heyford Avenue, Lambeth, while his stepfather was lodging away from home working as a wheelwright. Henry attended a London County Council school before attending the Regent Street Polytechnic. Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and also recalled watching W. G. Grace play cricket. On leaving school, Allingham started work as a trainee surgical instrument maker at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. He did not find this job very interesting, and so left to work for a coachbuilder specialising in car bodies.

==First World War==
Allingham wanted to join the war effort in August 1914 as a despatch rider, but his critically ill mother managed to persuade him to stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, aged 42, Allingham enlisted with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). He became formally rated as an Air Mechanic Second Class on 21 September 1915, and was posted to Chingford before completing his training at Sheerness, Kent. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.

After graduation, Allingham was posted to the RNAS Air Station at Great Yarmouth where he worked in aircraft maintenance. On 13 April 1916, King George V inspected the air station and its aircraft. Allingham later reported disappointment at narrowly missing an opportunity to speak to the King.

Allingham also worked in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was conducted and was later involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would last two or three days and would involve hoisting a seaplane in and out of the water by means of a deck-mounted derrick.

During the preparations for the Battle of Jutland, Allingham was ordered to join the naval trawler HMT &quot;Kingfisher&quot;. Onboard was a Sopwith Schneider seaplane that was used to patrol the surrounding waters for the German High Seas Fleet. &quot;Kingfisher&quot; had been the first trawler to be equipped with a seaplane, in May 1915. Allingham&#x27;s responsibilities included helping to launch this aircraft. Although the &quot;Kingfisher&quot; was not directly involved in the battle (she shadowed the Grand Fleet and then the High Seas Fleet), Allingham still rightfully claimed to be the last known survivor of that battle and could recall &quot;seeing shells ricocheting across the sea.&quot;

In September 1917, Allingham, by then an Air Mechanic First Class, was posted to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS. This unit acted as a training squadron for other RNAS squadrons based on the Western Front. There is also some evidence that the squadron was involved in combat operations. When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS were involved in the Ypres offensive. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France, where he remained for the rest of the war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.

He transferred to the Royal Air Force when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially have a big impact on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans&#x27; Association, Allingham said, &quot;It is a shock as well as a privilege to think that I am the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed.&quot;

==Inter-war years==

===Career===
In addition to his military service as a mechanic, Allingham spent the vast majority of his professional life as an engineer. His employers included Thorns Car Body Makers, Vickers General Motors and H.J.M. Car Body Builders. He started his longest stretch of employment in 1934 designing new car bodies for the Ford Motor Company at their Dagenham plant which had opened only a few years previously in 1931.

===Family life===
Allingham met Dorothy Cator (1897-1970) in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk in 1918. They married the same year in Romford, when she was 21 and he was 22. They moved to Eastbourne, Sussex in 1961 and remained married until she died there from acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. They had two daughters, Betty (1920-2023) and Jean (1923–2001). Jean immigrated to the United States after she married an American WWII veteran soldier and died aged 78 in 2001. 

At the time of his death Allingham believed that Betty had died. He had lost touch with her in the 1970s following a family rift after the death of his wife in 1970; however she was still alive aged 88 when her father died, and living in Stroud, Gloucestershire. In addition to Betty, at the time of his death Allingham had: 
7 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 14 great-great-grandchildren and 1 great-great-great-grandchild.

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, Allingham was in a reserved occupation and worked on a number of projects. Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise the mines and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.

==Later life==
After the Second World War Allingham continued to work for Ford until he retired in 1961. After Denis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans&#x27; Association tracked him down in 2001, a 105-year-old Allingham took a prominent role in telling his story so that later generations would not forget. On 16 October 2003, he helped launch the 2003 Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal with model Nell McAndrew aboard the cruiser . He was quoted as saying &quot;[The veterans] have given all they have got for the country ... I owe them ... we all owe them.&quot;

A ceremony at The Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War. Allingham attended, together with three other First World War veterans, William Stone, Fred Lloyd and John Oborne. Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. That was the last time a First World War veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it marked the end of an era. No First World War veterans were present at the Cenotaph for the 2006 Remembrance Sunday Parade.

As the last surviving member of the RNAS, and the last living founding member of the RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at Saint-Omer on 11 September 2004. During the ceremony, Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the Freedom of the Town. The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne.

In November 2005, Allingham accepted an invitation from the International Holographic Portrait Archive to have his holographic portrait taken. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London&#x27;s floating naval museum on board HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, entitled the &quot;Ghosts of Jutland&quot;. A copy of this portrait was donated to the museum and the Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark the opening of the exhibition.

Allingham was awarded the freedom of his home town of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006. He lived in his own home until May 2006 when, one month before his 110th birthday and with failing eyesight, he moved to Blind Veterans UK (formally known as St Dunstan&#x27;s), a charity for blind ex-service personnel, at Ovingdean, near Brighton. Aside from his poor eyesight, he was reportedly in good health.

Allingham attended the 1 July 2006 commemorations at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing. He did not attend the 2006 Remembrance Day parade on 11 November at the Cenotaph as he was in France at a wreath-laying ceremony and to receive the Freedom of The Town of Saint-Omer. He did, however, launch the Eastbourne Poppy Appeal before leaving for this trip.

On 18 April 2007 Allingham visited Wilnecote High School in Tamworth, Staffordshire to answer students&#x27; questions about the First World War, after they wrote to the few surviving veterans asking them about their experiences. In October 2007 he was honoured at the Pride of Britain Awards. Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit to The Oval on 5 June 2007, the day before his 111th birthday, where he was wheeled around the boundary in front of the spectators.

On his 111th birthday in June 2007, a Royal Marines band played to Allingham on board before he returned with friends and relatives to the Queen&#x27;s Hotel on the Portsmouth seafront for afternoon tea. Asked how it felt, Allingham replied, &quot;I&#x27;m pleased to be seeing another tomorrow. It&#x27;s just the same as it was as at any age, it&#x27;s no different. I&#x27;m happy to be alive and I&#x27;m looking forward to the celebrations. I never imagined I&#x27;d get to 111.&quot;

On 1 April 2008, the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Air Force, Allingham was a guest of honour at the celebratory events at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. By then, Allingham was the only surviving founder member of the RAF.

Allingham celebrated his 112th birthday with members of his family at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire as the guest of honour at a luncheon at the college. During the day the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performed a flypast which was followed by an aerobatic display from two Tutor aircraft. In June 2008, as part of the National Veterans&#x27; Day celebrations, Allingham was given a guided tour of the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire.

On 23 September 2008, Allingham launched a book about his life, co-written by Denis Goodwin, with an event at the RAF Club in London.
On 11 November 2008, marking the 90th anniversary of the end of the First World War, together with Harry Patch and Bill Stone, Allingham laid a commemorative wreath for the Act of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in London. Allingham was invested as a Scout on 18 November 2008, 100 years after he first joined as a youth. This would prove to be the last such event attended by surviving veterans of the conflict, as all three men died within the next year.

He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Allingham celebrated his 113th birthday on , at an event hosted by the Royal Navy. He received a signed birthday card from First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band and saw a Mark 8 Royal Navy Lynx flying overhead while he was sitting outside in his wheelchair.

in 2009 the artist Dan Llywelyn Hall sat with Allingham at St Dunstan&#x27;s for a portrait. The painting entitled &#x27;The Last Volunteer&#x27; which was exhibited in London in the year of Allingham&#x27;s death

When asked the secret of his long life, Allingham said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I would say, be as good as you possibly can.&quot;

==Oldest living man==
Allingham credited &quot;cigarettes, whisky and wild, wild women – and a good sense of humour&quot; for his longevity.

Allingham was the oldest living man in England for several years. Official recognition by Guinness World Records came in January 2007. On 8 February 2007, when 110-year-old Antonio Pierro died, Allingham became the oldest known living veteran of the First World War, and the third-oldest living man in the world.

Allingham overtook George Frederick Ives as the longest-lived member of the British Armed Forces on 2 November 2007. He was therefore the longest-lived British First World War veteran to date.

Following the death of Tomoji Tanabe on 19 June 2009, Allingham became the oldest living man. At his death, he was the oldest living veteran of the First World War, but not the longest lived member of any armed force in any conflict; this record is held by Emiliano Mercado del Toro of Puerto Rico, who also served during the First World War.

He was also the first ever British man to reach the verified age of 113.

On 18 July 2009, Allingham died of natural causes aged 113 years and 42 days.

As the number of First World War veterans dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty&#x27;s Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place after the death of the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he tried not to think about the prospect, but has also been quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t mind — as long as it&#x27;s not me.&quot; Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.

In Harry Patch&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Fighting Tommy&quot;, the author claims that Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science. In his own book, &quot;Kitchener&#x27;s Last Volunteer&quot;, Allingham confirmed that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he became a symbol of World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end, he agreed to a funeral and cremation.

===War medals and awards===

Allingham was awarded four medals, two of which were medals from the First World War. The Gold Medal of Saint-Omer was awarded to Allingham on 11 September 2004 when he was given the Freedom of the Town of Saint-Omer. He was also awarded France&#x27;s highest military honour, the Légion d&#x27;honneur, in which he was appointed a &quot;chevalier&quot; in 2003 and promoted to &quot;officier&quot; in 2009. The remaining two medals are British Campaign Medals from the First World War: the British War Medal and the Victory Medal; those two medals are colloquially known as &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;. These two medals are replacement medals supplied by the Ministry of Defence after discovering at a recent cenotaph parade that Allingham&#x27;s original campaign medals were destroyed during the Blitz of the Second World War.

===Honorary awards===
As well as the above-mentioned decorations, Allingham won several awards and honorary memberships. Examples include the Pride of Britain award, and a position as an honorary member of the Fleet Air Arm Association.

Although not formally qualified he was recognised by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) who presented him with a Chartered Engineer award on 19 December 2008.

Allingham had the following to say about the award:

This was followed on 22 May 2009 with the award of an honorary doctorate in engineering at the Southampton Solent University by the university&#x27;s chancellor, the former First Sea Lord Alan West, for his contribution to Britain and its allies during two world wars and his continuing charity work, especially connected with veteran servicemen and women.

==Death and funeral==

Allingham died of natural causes in his sleep at 3:10 am on 18 July 2009 at his care home, Blind Veterans UK centre in Ovingdean near Brighton, aged 113 years and 42 days. After his death, Walter Breuning succeeded him as the world&#x27;s oldest man.

Allingham&#x27;s funeral took place at St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Brighton at noon on 30 July 2009, with full military honours. His coffin was carried by three Royal Navy seamen and three RAF airmen. The service was preceded by a half-muffled quarter peal on the church&#x27;s bells, rung by local ringers and members of the RAF and Royal Navy change ringing associations. Among the mourners were the Duchess of Gloucester, representing the Queen, and Veterans&#x27; Minister Kevan Jones. Senior Royal Navy and Royal Air Force officers, including Vice-Admiral Sir Adrian Johns and Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye, represented the two services of which Allingham had been a member. Allingham&#x27;s surviving daughter, Betty Hankin, 89, attended the funeral, with several members of her family. The funeral was followed by a flypast of five replica First World War aircraft; British and French buglers played the Last Post and Reveille; and a bell was tolled 113 times, once for each year of his life.

The BBC commissioned Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Allingham and Harry Patch, who died one week after Allingham on 25 July 2009. The result, &quot;Last Post&quot;, was read by Duffy on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Today&quot; on the day of Allingham&#x27;s funeral. A tree was planted, and a commemorative plaque unveiled, at the Eastbourne Redoubt on 22 May 2010 to mark Allingham&#x27;s residence in the town.

<text>The Vermont State House, located in Montpelier, is the state capitol of the U.S. state of Vermont. It is the seat of the Vermont General Assembly. The current Greek Revival structure is the third building on the same site to be used as the State House. Designed by Thomas Silloway in 1857 and 1858, it was occupied in 1859.

A careful restoration of the Vermont State House began in the early 1980s led by curator David Schütz and the Friends of the Vermont State House, a citizens&#x27; advisory committee. The general style of the building is Neoclassical and Greek Revival and is furnished in American Empire, Renaissance Revival, and Rococo Revival styles. Some rooms have been restored to represent latter-19th-century styles including the &quot;Aesthetic Movement&quot; style.

Since 1994, Buildings and General Services Architect Tricia Harper has been responsible for design and construction for the restoration and renovation project of the building and its grounds.

The Vermont State House is located on State Street on the western edge of downtown Montpelier, a block north of the Winooski River. Set against a wooded hillside (which was open pasture land earlier during much of its history), the building and its distinctive gold leaf dome are easily visible while approaching Montpelier, the smallest city to serve as capital of a U.S. state.

==History and architecture==

===Exterior facade and dome===

The current structure was designed by architect Thomas Silloway (1828–1910) amplifying the design of an earlier structure designed by Ammi B. Young, (1798–1874) later supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury. The first State House built in 1808 by Sylvanus Baldwin was replaced by the current Vermont Supreme Court Building completed in 1918.

The prior edifice, known as the &quot;Second State House&quot;, was constructed on the same site between 1833 and 1838. Young&#x27;s structure was of a more reserved Greek Revival design based upon the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. Gray Barre granite is used for the two-story cruciform design with a Doric portico and a low saucer dome echoing William Thornton&#x27;s earliest design for the United States Capitol. Young&#x27;s structure was almost entirely destroyed by a fire in January 1857. Silloway was able to salvage the Doric portico, as well as portions of the granite walls. Silloway added an additional bay of windows on each side of the central portico and increased the height of the dome (copper on a wood substructure) to its current level. This may have been done to imitate the increased height of the new Capitol dome in Washington designed by Thomas U. Walter which was being constructed during the same time.

The dome and roofs were originally painted a dark terracotta red to suggest Tuscan tile. The dome was not gilded until the early 20th century, when many states did so as a part of the Colonial Revival style. 
====Ceres====

The dome is topped by a statue named &quot;Agriculture&quot;, a representation of Ceres, an ancient Roman goddess of agriculture. The original statue was carved by Vermont artist Larkin Goldsmith Mead, who also carved the large bust of Lincoln in the Hall of Inscriptions on the State House&#x27;s ground floor. This statue was installed in 1858. When the first statue rotted out a replacement based on Mead&#x27;s original was carved in 1938 by then 87-year-old Dwight Dwinell, Sergeant-at-Arms (in Vermont this official position is similar in nature to the White House Chief Usher). In April 2018 the second statue was removed. The current statue was carved by Chris Miller out of a laminated block of mahogany and was based on a one-quarter scale model created by Jerry Williams which was also based on the original 1858 statue.

The Doric portico, the main ceremonial entrance, houses a granite statue of Ethan Allen. Ethan Allen was a founder of Vermont and commander of the Green Mountain Boys, an early Vermont military infantry active during the Vermont Republic (1777–1791). The statue was carved by Aristide Piccini in 1941, to replace the original marble version carved by Larkin Goldsmith Mead in 1858. The architect Stanford White (1853–1906) considered Silloway&#x27;s Vermont State House to be the finest example of the Greek Revival style in the United States.

===Interiors, furnishings, and decorative arts===
The State House contains two primary floors accessible by a pair of circular stairways opening into the ground-floor Cross Hall. An elevator is also available. The Entrance Hall is of the Greek Ionic order and flanked by portraits of Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Chester A. Arthur, both native to Vermont. The tall double front doors were painted and then coated with a metallic powder to appear as bronze in 1859. The Entrance Hall contains a portrait of Montpelier native Admiral George Dewey on the bridge of his flagship during the Battle of Manila Bay. The Vermont State House does not have a rotunda, the dome being located almost directly above the ceiling of Representatives Hall on the second floor. The principal public room is the Hall of Inscriptions, a Doric pilastered corridor featuring eight monumental marble tablets incised with quotations about the distinct nature of Vermont&#x27;s culture and heritage. The tablets quote the Vermont Constitution, Ethan Allen, Calvin Coolidge, George Aiken, Warren Austin, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher among others. Each tablet features fourteen gilded stars, representing Vermont&#x27;s fourteen counties, the state&#x27;s fourteen years as an independent republic, and being the fourteenth state to join the federal Union. The four corners of each tablet feature a sheath of grain, a detail found in the Great Seal of Vermont, designed by Ira Allen.

The ceremonial office of the Governor of Vermont, used during legislative sessions for meetings and bill-signings, is located in the second-floor west wing of the building. The Executive Chamber has been restored to its 1859 appearance with pediment hooded windows supported by Italianate-style brackets, and gilded Rococo Revival drapery cornices. A Wilton style carpet colored crimson, azure blue and gold was rewoven as part of the restoration. The Vermont Governor&#x27;s working office and private apartments are located nearby at The Pavilion, built in Second Empire style and located just east of the Vermont Supreme Court. Portraits of Vermont governors (including Howard Dean, who is shown in an idiosyncratic pose in a canoe amid a natural setting) are displayed through the first and second floors of the State House, the corridors of which are a sort of state portrait gallery, commemorating famous Vermonters.

The two chambers of the Vermont General Assembly are on the second floor. While both chambers have overhead visitors&#x27; galleries accessible on a third-floor mezzanine, visitors are welcome to quietly enter and sit in the main floor of the chambers. Contrary to the tradition of decorating the upper house in red and the lower house in green, established by the House of Lords and House of Commons in the United Kingdom, Vermont reserves the state colors of green and gold for its upper house, the Vermont Senate. Red and gold is used for the Vermont House of Representatives which meets in Representatives Hall. A large plaster ceiling medallion in the center of the chamber in the form of a lotus with a center rosette of acanthus leaves hold a two-tiered electrified gasolier manufactured in Philadelphia by Cornelius and Baker. Each petal of the rosette weighs approximately 500 pounds. Brilliant axminster carpets have been recreated for both chambers based on old stereoscope views and small scraps found in an attic. On either side of the rostrum in Representatives Hall, are a series of connected elliptical-backed seats designed to fill the north wall of the chamber. The seats are upholstered and tufted in crimson and are used to seat members of the Vermont Senate during joint sessions of the General Assembly. The seats also accommodate the justices of the State&#x27;s supreme court for the Governor&#x27;s State of the State address and the inauguration of governors. Citizens frequently occupy these seats when the House is in separate session, or for large public hearings.
The second floor of the west wing includes the Cedar Creek Room, a large reception room featuring a mural painted by Julian Scott in 1874. The mural nearly fills the south wall and depicts the Battle of Cedar Creek during the American Civil War. The painting highlights the contributions of Vermont troops in the battle. The room is illuminated by two stained glass skylights in the deeply coffered ceiling dating to 1859 when the room housed the State Library. At some time the skylight was broken, and the opening closed. In 1970, while doing renovation work, workers discovered the broken pieces neatly stacked in the attic above the room. The pieces were reassembled, conserved, and reinstalled during the mid-1980s. One window (shown at left) depicts the obverse of the coat of arms of Vermont, which is a more painterly armorial representation of the Great Seal of Vermont (reserved solely for embossing documents), the arms are topped by the head of a buck white-tailed deer and circled by branches of Eastern White Pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;). Pine badges were worn as an expression of Vermont identity by citizens while the state was a republic, and again during the American Civil War by Vermont&#x27;s military regiments. The other skylight features the rarely seen reverse of the state coat of arms, a female personification of the state referred to as &quot;Vermontannia.&quot; The wall stencils in the Cedar Creek Room are the original patterns, recreated based upon old photographs, and the colors were matched by paint analysis. It is seated among sheaths of corn and wheat, representing Vermont&#x27;s agricultural history. This room is restored to its 1888 appearance when the room was converted from the State Library to use as a governor&#x27;s reception room. The walls, and 20-foot ceilings are polychrome painted in a complex palette of tertiary colors: burnished copper, russet, salmon, and a deep blue-green with overlays of metallic stencilling. The style is largely of the Aesthetic Movement.

Most of the furnishings in the building date to the 1859 reconstruction of the State House, including the 30 black walnut chairs in the Vermont Senate chamber, still used for the same purpose today. Several American Empire-style sofas, a set of klismos chairs, carved black walnut Renaissance Revival-style chairs for the Senate President and House Speaker, and suites of Rococo Revival settées and chairs also date to the completion of Silloway&#x27;s reconstruction. The majority of the lighting fixtures in the building are original, restored and electrified ormolu gas chandeliers and wall sconces manufactured in Philadelphia by Cornelius and Baker during the 1850s. The large two-tiered, 26-light chandelier in Representatives Hall features sculptures of mythological figures, including a copy of Vermont sculptor Hiram Powers&#x27; &quot;The Greek Slave&quot;, which became an abolitionist icon. Only the large portrait of George Washington, painted by George Gassner after Gilbert Stuart, which hangs above the speaker&#x27;s chair in Representatives Hall, survived the fire of 1857.

==Use of the Vermont State House==
Vermont&#x27;s reputation for popular government is represented by the State House&#x27;s nickname &quot;the People&#x27;s House.&quot; While its primary use is as the house of the legislative branch of Vermont government, it has from its beginnings also functioned as a living museum and state cultural facility.

The building is open to visitors with remarkably few restrictions whether the legislature is in session or not. The large Representatives Hall is used for evening concerts named &quot;Farmers Nights&quot; during winter months. During warmer weather, the public lawn on the south side is used for concerts by the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, municipal bands from around the state, marching regimental bagpipe tattoos, modern dance concerts, as well as to provide space for local residents to sit, eat, and play sports. Quilts, ceramics, photography and paintings by citizens periodically hang in the building&#x27;s corridors, committee and caucus rooms, and dining room.

In recent years, each February 14 the columns of the portico and lawn are bedecked with red paper hearts by the so-called Valentine Phantom. Additionally, the public lawn and steps of the portico serve as a well-used platform for peaceful demonstrations, press conferences by various official and non-official groups, and for formally welcoming official visitors to the State of Vermont.

The House&#x27;s backup generator in the basement was replaced by a 250 kWh battery in 2020, and supplies peak power and grid services to the public grid.

<text>Integrative psychotherapy is the integration of elements from different schools of psychotherapy in the treatment of a client. &quot;Integrative psychotherapy&quot; may also refer to the psychotherapeutic process of integrating the personality: uniting the &quot;affective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological systems within a person&quot;.

==Background==
Initially, Sigmund Freud developed a talking cure called psychoanalysis; then he wrote about his therapy and popularized psychoanalysis. After Freud, many different disciplines splintered off. Some of the more common therapies include: psychodynamic psychotherapy, transactional analysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, gestalt therapy, body psychotherapy, family systems therapy, person-centered psychotherapy, and existential therapy. Hundreds of different theories of psychotherapy are practiced.

A new therapy is born in several stages. After being trained in an existing school of psychotherapy, the therapist begins to practice. Then, after follow up training in other schools, the therapist may combine the different theories as a basis of a new practice. Then, some practitioners write about their new approach and label this approach with a new name.

A pragmatic or a theoretical approach can be taken when fusing schools of psychotherapy. Pragmatic practitioners blend a few strands of theory from a few schools as well as various techniques; such practitioners are sometimes called &quot;eclectic psychotherapists&quot; and are primarily concerned with what works. Alternatively, other therapists consider themselves to be more theoretically grounded as they blend their theories; they are called &quot;integrative psychotherapists&quot; and are not only concerned with what works, but also why it works.

For example, an eclectic therapist might experience a change in their client after administering a particular technique and be satisfied with a positive result. In contrast, an integrative therapist is curious about the &quot;why and how&quot; of the change as well. A theoretical emphasis is important: for example, the client may only have been trying to please the therapist and was adapting to the therapist rather than becoming more fully empowered in themselves.

==Different routes to integration==

The most recent edition of the &quot;Handbook of Psychotherapy Integration&quot; (Norcross &amp; Goldfried, 2005) recognized four general routes to integration: common factors, technical eclecticism, theoretical integration, and assimilative integration. 

===Common factors===
The first route to integration is called common factors and &quot;seeks to determine the core ingredients that different therapies share in common&quot;. The advantage of a common factors approach is the emphasis on therapeutic actions that have been demonstrated to be effective. The disadvantage is that common factors may overlook specific techniques that have been developed within particular theories. Common factors have been described by Jerome Frank, Bruce Wampold, and Miller, Duncan and Hubble (2005). Common factors theory asserts it is precisely the factors common to the most psychotherapies that make any psychotherapy successful.

Some psychologists have converged on the conclusion that a wide variety of different psychotherapies can be integrated via their common ability to trigger the neurobiological mechanism of memory reconsolidation in such a way as to lead to deconsolidation.

===Technical eclecticism===
The second route to integration is technical eclecticism which is designed &quot;to improve our ability to select the best treatment for the person and the problem…guided primarily by data on what has worked best for others in the past&quot;. The advantage of technical eclecticism is that it encourages the use of diverse strategies without being hindered by theoretical differences. A disadvantage is that there may not be a clear conceptual framework describing how techniques drawn from divergent theories might fit together. The most well known model of technical eclectic psychotherapy is Arnold Lazarus&#x27; (2005) multimodal therapy. Another model of technical eclecticism is Larry E. Beutler and colleagues&#x27; &quot;systematic treatment selection&quot;. 

===Theoretical integration===

The third route to integration commonly recognized in the literature is theoretical integration in which &quot;two or more therapies are integrated in the hope that the result will be better than the constituent therapies alone&quot;. Some models of theoretical integration focus on combining and synthesizing a small number of theories at a deep level, whereas others describe the relationship between several systems of psychotherapy. One prominent example of theoretical synthesis is Paul Wachtel&#x27;s model of &quot;cyclical psychodynamics&quot; that integrates psychodynamic, behavioral, and family systems theories. Another example of synthesis is Anthony Ryle&#x27;s model of cognitive analytic therapy, integrating ideas from psychoanalytic object relations theory and cognitive psychotherapy. Another model of theoretical integration is specifically called integral psychotherapy (Forman, 2010; Ingersoll &amp; Zeitler, 2010). The most notable model describing the relationship between several different theories is the transtheoretical model.

===Assimilative integration===

Assimilative integration is the fourth route and acknowledges that most psychotherapists select a theoretical orientation that serves as their foundation but, with experience, incorporate ideas and strategies from other sources into their practice. &quot;This mode of integration favors a firm grounding in any one system of psychotherapy, but with a willingness to incorporate or assimilate, in a considered fashion, perspectives or practices from other schools&quot;. Some counselors may prefer the security of one foundational theory as they begin the process of integrative exploration. Formal models of assimilative integration have been described based on a psychodynamic foundation, and based on cognitive behavioral therapy.

Govrin (2015) pointed out a form of integration, which he called &quot;integration by conversion&quot;, whereby theorists import into their own system of psychotherapy a foreign and quite alien concept, but they give the concept a new meaning that allows them to claim that the newly imported concept was really an integral part of their original system of psychotherapy, even if the imported concept significantly changes the original system. Govrin gave as two examples Heinz Kohut&#x27;s novel emphasis on empathy in psychoanalysis in the 1970s and the novel emphasis on mindfulness and acceptance in &quot;third-wave&quot; cognitive behavioral therapy in the 1990s to 2000s.

===Other models that combine routes===

In addition to well-established approaches that fit into the five routes mentioned above, there are newer models that combine aspects of the traditional routes.

Clara E. Hill&#x27;s (2014) three-stage model of helping skills encourages counselors to emphasize skills from different theories during different stages of helping. Hill&#x27;s model might be considered a combination of theoretical integration and technical eclecticism. The first stage is the &quot;exploration&quot; stage. This is based on client-centered therapy. The second stage is entitled &quot;insight&quot;. Interventions used in this stage are based on psychoanalytic therapy. The last stage, the &quot;action&quot; stage, is based on behavioral therapy.

Good and Beitman (2006) described an integrative approach highlighting both core components of effective therapy and specific techniques designed to target clients&#x27; particular areas of concern. This approach can be described as an integration of common factors and technical eclecticism.

Multitheoretical psychotherapy is an integrative model that combines elements of technical eclecticism and theoretical integration. Therapists are encouraged to make intentional choices about combining theories and intervention strategies.

An approach called integral psychotherapy is grounded in the work of theoretical psychologist and philosopher Ken Wilber (2000), who integrates insights from contemplative and meditative traditions. Integral theory is a meta-theory that recognizes that reality can be organized from four major perspectives: subjective, intersubjective, objective, and interobjective. Various psychotherapies typically ground themselves in one of these four foundational perspectives, often minimizing the others. Integral psychotherapy includes all four. For example, psychotherapeutic integration using this model would include subjective approaches (cognitive, existential), intersubjective approaches (interpersonal, object relations, multicultural), objective approaches (behavioral, pharmacological), and interobjective approaches (systems science). By understanding that each of these four basic perspectives all simultaneously co-occur, each can be seen as essential to a comprehensive view of the life of the client. Integral theory also includes a stage model that suggests that various psychotherapies seek to address issues arising from different stages of psychological development.

The generic term, integrative psychotherapy, can be used to describe any multi-modal approach which combines therapies. For example, an effective form of treatment for some clients is psychodynamic psychotherapy combined with hypnotherapy. Kraft &amp; Kraft (2007) gave a detailed account of this treatment with a 54-year-old female client with refractory IBS in a setting of a phobic anxiety state. The client made a full recovery and this was maintained at the follow-up a year later.

== Principles of integrative psychotherapy ==
There are several principles of interactive therapy that reflect its adaptive, client-centered approach. These principles are intended to guide therapists in selecting, applying, and adapting therapeutic methods to meet the unique needs of each client, promoting a flexible and holistic approach to mental health care.

=== Therapeutic alliance and client collaboration ===
The therapeutic relationship is central to integrative therapy, where the therapist and client work as partners in the healing process. Integrative therapy emphasizes mutual respect, empathy, and understanding, believing that meaningful change is more likely to occur within a trusting and collaborative environment. This alliance empowers clients to take an active role in their therapy thereby enhancing motivation, engagement, and the long-term effectiveness of treatment.

=== Flexibility and responsiveness ===
A defining principle of integrative therapy is its flexibility in responding to clients’ immediate needs. Therapists trained in integrative methods prioritize adaptability, tailoring interventions in real time to suit a client&#x27;s progress, life changes, and therapeutic goals. This responsiveness allows for a fluid treatment process, as opposed to rigid adherence to any single theoretical approach.

=== Holistic client-centered focus ===
Integrative therapy advocates for a holistic perspective on mental health, recognizing that emotional well-being is influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. Therapists aim to address the whole person—rather than just symptoms—by considering lifestyle, relational dynamics, cultural background, and environmental influences. This comprehensive focus supports an individualized approach, acknowledging that healing can be facilitated by understanding the person in context.

=== Ongoing personal and professional growth ===
An integrative approach encourages therapists to remain open to new ideas, personal growth, and professional development. Given that integrative therapy draws from multiple frameworks, therapists often undergo ongoing education to refine their skills and integrate new evidence-based practices. This commitment to self-improvement not only enhances therapeutic effectiveness but also models a growth-oriented mindset for clients.

==Comparison with eclecticism==

In &quot;Integrative and Eclectic Counselling and Psychotherapy&quot;, the authors make clear the distinction between integrative and eclectic psychotherapy approaches: &quot;Integration suggests that the elements are part of one combined approach to theory and practice, as opposed to eclecticism which draws ad hoc from several approaches in the approach to a particular case.&quot; Psychotherapy&#x27;s eclectic practitioners are not bound by the theories, dogma, conventions or methodology of any one particular school. Instead, they may use what they believe or feel or experience tells them will work best, either in general or suiting the often immediate needs of individual clients; and working within their own preferences and capabilities as practitioners.

In 2013, Shibasaki made her U.S. film debut in &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, a Keanu Reeves-led adaptation of the &quot;Chushingura&quot; story of samurai loyalty and revenge. The film was billed as the first ever English-language adaptation of the legend, based on historical events in the early 18th century.

Although she does not compose her own music, Kō Shibasaki writes the lyrics for most of her songs. Many of her singles have become theme songs for various films, dramas, and commercials. Her single &quot;Lover Soul&quot; was the ending theme song for the live action drama &quot;Otomen.&quot;

Her song &quot;Another World&quot; was the soundtrack of the live-action drama &quot;Mirai Nikki - Another:World&quot; (2011).

<doc id="1105686" wikidata="Q776177" url="?curid=1105686" title="Eaters of the Dead">
<text>Eaters of the Dead: The Manuscript of Ibn Fadlan Relating His Experiences with the Northmen in AD 922 (later republished as The 13th Warrior to correspond with the film adaptation of the novel) is a 1976 novel by Michael Crichton, the fourth novel under his own name and his 14th overall. The story is about a 10th-century Muslim Arab who travels with a group of Vikings to their settlement.

Crichton explains in an appendix that the book was based on two sources. The first three chapters are a retelling of Ahmad ibn Fadlan&#x27;s personal account of his actual journey north and his experiences with and observations of Varangians. The remainder is a retelling of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the 10th century. The Caliph of Baghdad, Al-Muqtadir, sends his ambassador, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, on a mission to assist the king of the Volga Bulgars. Ahmad ibn Fadlan never arrives, as he is conscripted by a group of Vikings, led by their chieftain Buliwyf, to take part in a hero&#x27;s quest to the north; he is taken along as the 13th member of their group to comply with a soothsayer&#x27;s requirement for success. They travel to Hurot Hall, the home of King Hrothgar, to defend it from the &#x27;mist-monsters&#x27;, or &#x27;wendol&#x27;, a tribe of vicious savages (suggested by the narrator to have been possibly relict Neanderthals) who go to battle wearing bearskins. After two devastating battles, Ibn Fadlan and the remaining Northmen decide to attack the Wendol village, which is located in a network of sea caves. They infiltrate the sea caves, assassinate the head of the Wendol tribe, and return to Hurot Hall. Buliwyf, however, is mortally wounded in the attempt. At Hurot, they encounter the Wendol in battle for a final time, defeating them. Ibn Fadlan is then allowed to continue on his journey.

&quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript. The narrator describes the story as a composite of extant commentaries and translations of the original storyteller&#x27;s manuscript. The narration makes several references to a possible change or mistranslation of the original story by later copiers. The story is told by several different voices: the editor/narrator, the translators of the script, and the original author, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who also relates stories told by others. A sense of authenticity is supported by occasional explanatory footnotes with references to a mixture of factual and fictitious sources.

==Sources and inspiration==
In the afterword, Crichton gives a few comments on the book&#x27;s origin. A good friend of Crichton&#x27;s was giving a lecture on the &quot;Bores of Literature&quot;. Included in his lecture was an argument on &quot;Beowulf&quot; and why it was simply uninteresting. Crichton opined that the story was not a bore but was, in fact, a very interesting work. The argument escalated until Crichton stated that he would prove to him that the story could be interesting if presented in the correct way.

Abdul Alḥaẓred&#x27;s &quot;Necronomicon&quot; (of H. P. Lovecraft fame) is mentioned in passing as a reference.

==Reception==
The critic from the &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;diverting but disappointing&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said it was &quot;funny, fascinating and informative&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
In 1979, it was announced the movie version of the novel would be made by the newly formed Orion Pictures with Crichton as director. This did not occur.

The novel was adapted into film as &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999), directed by John McTiernan and released by Walt Disney Pictures through its Touchstone Pictures banner. Crichton did some uncredited directing for a reshoot after Disney fired McTiernan for various reasons, one of which was going far over budget. Antonio Banderas played Ibn Fadlan. Crichton writes that he was &quot;quite pleased&quot; with the film, although it received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office, earning about $62 million worldwide; the film&#x27;s budget was more than $100 million.

<text>The maned rat or (African) crested rat (Lophiomys imhausi) is a nocturnal, long-haired and bushy-tailed East African rodent that superficially resembles a porcupine. The world&#x27;s only known poisonous rodent, the maned rat sequesters toxins from plants to fend off predators.

==Description==
The maned rat&#x27;s body can grow up to long, or from head to tail. The coat consists of long, silver and black-tipped guard hairs over a dense, woolly, grey and white undercoat, with the face and limbs having short, black fur. A mane of longer, coarser black-and-white banded hairs extends from the top of the animal&#x27;s head to just beyond the base of the tail. This mane is bordered by a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin. The forelimbs and hind limbs have short black fur. The forefeet are large and digit 1 of the forefeet does not have a claw while digits 2-5 have a well developed claw.

When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane erects and this strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this area are, at the tips, like ordinary hair, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent with a honeycomb structure. The rat is known to deliberately smear these hairs with poison from the bark of the &quot;Acokanthera schimperi&quot;, the poison arrow tree, on which it chews, thus creating a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it. It is the only rodent known to utilize and store toxins from a different species in nature to protect itself, with no known adverse effects to themselves. 

&quot;L. imhausi&quot; differs from typical Muridae in having the temporal fossa roofed over a thin plate of bone, rudimentary clavicles, and an opposable hallux. The dorsal surface of the skull is covered with small bony projections which gives it a pebbled look. The projections are 0.3mm across and are separated every 0.3mm. On these grounds, it has been made the type of a family; its dentition, however, is typical Cricetine. The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3, giving it a total of 16 teeth. The cusps of the molars are arranged biserially and connected medially by longitudinal enamel crests.

==Diet==
Its diet in the wild consists largely of leaves, fruit, and other plant material, but it has been known to eat meat, cereals, root vegetables, and insects in captivity. Food is eaten by sitting on its haunches and using its forepaws to bring food items to its mouth. It is the only species in the super family Muroidea whose stomach is highly compartmentalized. The stomach contains five anatomically discrete sections that superficially resemble the sacculated configuration characteristic of ruminant artiodactyls. By virtue of its large size and biomass, &quot;L. imhausi&quot; may be one of the few muroid rodents that can harbor a symbiotic microflora in the foregut and profit metabolically from gastric fermentation of cellulose.

==Habitat==
The habitat of the maned rat ranges from nearly sea level, in Ethiopia and Somalia, to more typically the drier, highland forests and woodlands of Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya. Fossil remains have been found as far north as Palestine, however. They are often found in rocky areas or in hollow tree trunks and holes along the tops of ravines, and have also been found nesting among rocks on cliff-faces.

==Reproduction==
The maned rat was believed to be solitary, but is now known to be somewhat sociable, with multiple animals trapped in the same territory; they purr and groom one another. Thus it is possible they form family groups of a male, female, and offspring.
The litter size is 1–3. The young are slightly haired at birth and white markings and black stripes on the body are visible after 9 days. By day 13, the eyes open. The hair is sufficiently long that the crest can be erectile by day 20. The newborns become mobile by day 23 and are weaned by day 40.

<text>The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a range of mid-sized SUVs produced by American manufacturer Jeep. At its introduction, while most SUVs were still manufactured with body-on-frame construction, the Grand Cherokee has used a unibody chassis from the start.

==Development==
The Grand Cherokee&#x27;s origins date back to 1983, when American Motors Corporation (AMC) was designing a successor to the Jeep Cherokee. Three outside (non-AMC) designers—Larry Shinoda, Alain Clenet, and Giorgetto Giugiaro—were also under contract with AMC to create and build a clay model of the Cherokee XJ replacement, then known as the &quot;XJC&quot; project. However, the basic design for the Cherokee&#x27;s replacement was well underway by AMC&#x27;s in-house designers and the 1989 Jeep Concept 1 show car foretold the basic design.

As AMC began the development of the next Jeep in 1985, management created a business process that is now known as product lifecycle management (PLM). According to François Castaing, vice president for Product Engineering and Development, the smallest U.S. automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors. The XJC&#x27;s development was aided by computer-aided design software systems making the engineers more productive. Meanwhile, new communication systems allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster, thus reducing costly engineering changes, because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The system was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its enterprise, thus connecting everyone involved in designing and building products.

The Grand Cherokee thus became the first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model continued and Chrysler&#x27;s employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were eager for a late-1980s release date; however, CEO Lee Iacocca was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans, thus delaying the Grand Cherokee&#x27;s release until late 1992 as an Explorer competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee used monocoque (unibody) construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame construction. A Dodge-branded version was designed as a precaution should Jeep dealers struggle to handle so many Grand Cherokee units.

The Grand Cherokee debuted in grand fashion at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. The vehicle that was driven was a Poppy Red Clear Coat 1993 Grand Cherokee ZJ Laredo with a quartz cloth interior and high-back bucket seats. Chrysler&#x27;s then-president Robert Lutz drove Detroit mayor Coleman Young from the Jefferson North Assembly Plant on North Jefferson Avenue with a police escort to Cobo Hall, up the steps of Cobo Hall, and through a plate-glass window to show off the new vehicle. Sales of the 1993 model year Grand Cherokee began in April 1992.

Production of the Grand Cherokee started shortly afterward in the purpose-built Jefferson North Assembly in Detroit. European Grand Cherokees are manufactured in Austria by Magna Steyr. The Grand Cherokee &quot;played a significant part in reviving Chrysler&#x27;s fortunes by moving it into the then-nascent market for high-margin sports utility vehicles.&quot;

Upon its introduction, it was the first full-scale manufacture of an automobile in the US using HFC-134a refrigerant in place of HCFC-12 for the HVAC system.

==First generation (ZJ; 1993)==


The original Grand Cherokee was launched in 1992 as a 1993 model-year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment. The &quot;ZJ&quot; models, manufactured from 1992 until 1998, originally came in three trim levels - base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited; subsequent trims were added, including Orvis (MY 95–98) and TSI (MY97–98). The base model included features such as full instrumentation, a cloth interior, and a standard five-speed manual transmission, while gaining the &quot;SE&quot; moniker for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side airbag and a four-wheel antilock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, cruise control, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body-color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a keyless entry system, woodgrain interior appliqué, lace-style alloy wheels, a driver information center with a compass, digitized climate control, an electrochromic rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with a multiband equalizer. By 1996, the options list grew to include heated seats. Standard was the 4.0 L engine, with the 5.2 L V8 (and 5.9 L in 1998) being optional, as with other models. Package groups with various trim levels included fog lamps and skid plates, as well as convenience, lighting, luxury, power, security, and trailer-towing packages.

When it was first introduced in April 1992 as an early 1993 model year vehicle, the Grand Cherokee only had one powertrain choice: the 4.0 L AMC-derived straight-six engine that made . This became the &quot;volume&quot; engine for the Grand Cherokee. Transmission choices included a four-speed automatic transmission (early production ZJs used the AW4—the A500SE (later 42RE) replaced the AW4 during the latter half of the 1993 model year) or an Aisin AX15 manual transmission. Low demand for the manual transmission resulted in its discontinuation after 1994, but European-market ZJs retained it when coupled to the diesel engine (which was unavailable in North America). The drive-train choices included rear-wheel drive or four-wheel-drive. In 1995, the engine&#x27;s rating was reduced by to due to new EPA regulations starting with the 1996 model year.

In 1997, for the 1998 model year, a variant of the top-level Grand Cherokee Limited, the &quot;5.9 Limited&quot;, was introduced. Jeep ads claimed it to be the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest sport utility vehicle&quot;, verified by third-party testing. The primary improvements in the 5.9 Limited version included a 5.9 L OHV V8 engine, heavy-duty 46RE automatic transmission, functional heat-extracting hood louvers, unique wide-slot body-colored grille with mesh inserts, special rocker moldings, low-restriction exhaust with three-inch chrome tip, a low-profile roof rack, and special 16-inch Ultra-Star wheels. The 5.9 Limited also received a 150 amp alternator and a two-speed electric cooling fan. Other features included a standard 180-watt, 10-speaker Infinity Gold sound system with a rear roof-mounted soundbar, standard sunroof, and an interior swaddled with unique &quot;calf&#x27;s nap&quot; soft leather and faux wood trim. The 5.9 Limited was awarded &quot;4×4 of the Year&quot; for 1998 by &quot;Petersen&#x27;s 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road&quot; magazine. The production of this model was 14,286 units.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of &quot;ZG&quot;.

==Second generation (WJ/WG; 1999)==

Launched in September 1998, the redesigned WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127 parts with its predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model was coded WG. The spare tire was relocated from the side of the cargo compartment to under the floor. (Like the 1998MY ZJ, the rear tailgate glass opened separately.) The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on-road performance figures (the fuel tank was replaced with one of a capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated. A redesign of the intake manifold added . While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 × 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern—5 × 5.

A notable feature available in this generation was the automatic four-wheel drive option called &quot;Quadra-Drive&quot;, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between the front and rear axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. A neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep&#x27;s Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels on either side of the axle. The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. The Quadra-Trac II system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.

The &quot;45RFE&quot; and &quot;545RFE&quot; automatic transmission in the WJ was notable. It included three planetary gear sets rather than the two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, and it would have been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a &quot;4-speed automatic&quot;. For MY 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at on a 545RFE is 2,000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model-year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission&#x27;s programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same. (Must purchase new PCM and ABS module and program them with a fake VIN to make this work.) The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the inline 6 engine. It had slight changes from the previous model Grand Cherokee.

The interior was also completely redesigned. The redesign allowed for larger rear doors, and more space for rear passengers. Controls for various items like headlights, heated seats, and rear wiper were moved to more convenient locations. The electronic Vehicle Information center was moved from below the radio to above the windshield and was standard on 2000–2004 models. Limited models included automatic dual-zone climate control. A 10-CD changer was also available with the Infinity Audio package.

In addition to Jeep&#x27;s UniFrame construction, Daimler Chrysler partnered with Porsche to further strengthen the frame. This was done to reduce Noise Vibration Harshness (NVH). UniFrame is an unusual construction scheme, it incorporates all of the strength and durability of a body-on-frame construction into a unitized construction. By adding stiffness and rigidity to the structure, they enhanced the ride and strengthened the network of steel beams, rails and pillars (or &quot;safety cage&quot;) that surround and protect occupants. More than 70 percent of the underbody is high-strength steel. All Jeep Grand Cherokees feature UniFrame construction.

The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2004 including round fog lamps, a lower front fascia, and a new body color-matched inset grille design.

Export models produced at the plant in Graz, Austria, were given the vehicle designation of &quot;WG&quot;.

==Third generation (WK; 2005)==

The WK Grand Cherokee debuted in 2004 for the 2005 model year at the 2004 New York International Auto Show with available Quadra-Drive II four-wheel drive, rear-seat DVD player and optional 5.7 L Hemi V8. The 3.7 L V6 engine replaced the 4.0 L straight-6. A Mercedes-Benz-sourced 3.0 L V6 Common Rail Diesel (CRD) was available outside of North America from launch.

Jeep replaced the XJ-era leading-arms live-axle front suspension (found in the ZJ and WJ) with an independent double-wishbone setup like that which debuted in the 2002 Liberty. Classed as a truck-based SUV, the WH/WK Grand Cherokee offers &quot;crossover&quot; refinement, capability, and NVH.

The 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee made its European debut at the Euro Camp Jeep in Ardèche, France. This Jeep has gained 4 stars in the Euro NCAP crash safety tests conducted in 2005.

The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2008 with revised headlights and available High-Intensity Discharge (HID) Headlamps with auto-leveling. The lower portion of the front bumper was still removable as it was from launch to increase the approach angle for off-road use. The 4.7 L was refined, now producing , and .

The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee is available with an improved 5.7 L Hemi engine rated at and of torque. The engine uses variable valve timing to increase fuel economy.

===Engines===
==Fourth generation (WK2; 2011)==
The fourth-generation WK2 Grand Cherokee went on sale in summer 2010 as a 2011 model. It was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show. In 2009, during its development, Chrysler management used it as an example of future products to convince United States, federal regulators of Chrysler&#x27;s future viability, for the purpose of requesting a federal loan. This culminated in the Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization that same year.

Like previous generations, the WK2 Grand Cherokee chassis is a steel unibody. Unlike previous generations, it features four-wheel independent suspension for better on-road handling. The WK2 and 2011 Durango use a Chrysler-designed and engineered platform/chassis that Mercedes-Benz later used for the Mercedes-Benz W166 series. The Chrysler-designed platform was part of the DaimlerChrysler engineering projects that were to launch the WK2 Grand Cherokee with the Mercedes-Benz ML to follow.

Engine choices include the all-new 3.6 L Pentastar V6 and 5.7 L Hemi V8. The Hemi V8 retains the Multiple Displacement System (MDS) that shuts down four cylinders in low-power driving situations. The V8 included a multi-speed automatic transmission featuring Electronic Range Selection (ERS) to manually limit the high gear operating range. Trailer towing is rated for Hemi models and for Pentastar models. A 3.0 L turbocharged diesel V6 developed and built by Fiat Powertrain Technologies and VM Motori (with Multijet II injection) rated at and of torque offered in export markets from mid-2011. The new 3.0 L CRD turbodiesel engine is available in European markets as low-power version.

The Grand Cherokee SRT8, which started production on July 16, 2011, is equipped with a 6.4 L Hemi V8 engine. Jeep claims the new SRT8 gets 13 percent better fuel economy than its predecessor.

For the 2022 model year, Jeep marketed the outgoing Grand Cherokee WK2 alongside the all-new Grand Cherokee WL model as the Grand Cherokee WK (not to be confused with the Grand Cherokee (WK), which was produced from 2005 until 2010). The lineup is condensed to base Laredo &quot;E&quot;, mid-level Laredo &quot;X&quot;, and range-topping Limited trims, with the only engine option being the base 3.6 L Pentastar V6 gasoline engine.

== Fifth generation (WL; 2021) ==
The fifth generation (WL) Grand Cherokee was revealed as the three-row LWB version, Grand Cherokee L on January 7, 2021. The two-row version was revealed on September 30, 2021. The Grand Cherokee L is assembled at the new Mack Avenue Assembly Complex, which is built on the grounds of the Mack Avenue Engine Complex in Detroit, Michigan. The two-row Grand Cherokee will continue to be assembled at the nearby Jefferson North Assembly Plant, where it has been assembled since its introduction in 1992 for the 1993 model year.

Three different four-wheel-drive systems will be available: Quadra-Trac I, Quadra-Trac II featuring low range, and Quadra Trac II with Electronic Limited Slip Differential (ELSD) also known as Quadra-Drive II with low range and &quot;Quadra Lift&quot; air suspension system, as well as rear-wheel drive. When properly equipped, the Grand Cherokee will be able to tow up to . The Grand Cherokee will also be able to ford up to of water (when equipped with the Quadra Lift air suspension system). All engines will be mated to a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission that is controlled via a rotary shift knob. The Selec Terrain system, first introduced on the Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2), will also be available on the Grand Cherokee WL, and is now controlled via a toggle switch in the center console. The Quadra Lift air suspension system is available only with the Quadra-Drive II system.

The 2021 Grand Cherokee is the third Fiat Chrysler Automobiles product to offer the new UConnect 5 infotainment suite, which will offer either an 8.4-inch or 10.1-inch high-resolution touchscreen display, SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L, SiriusXM Travel Link services, UConnect Guardian (powered by SiriusXM), a 4G LTE wireless Internet hotspot, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and an integrated virtual assistant that can be activated by the phrase, &quot;Hey UConnect&quot;, or &quot;Hey Jeep&quot;, and can control multiple features of the vehicle, as well as provide other pertinent information.

=== Grand Cherokee L ===
The Grand Cherokee L went on sale in June 2021. Its wheelbase is longer than the previous generation two-row model, and longer than its two-row counterpart. It is equipped with an independent front and multi-link rear suspension. It arrived in Mexico in September 2021, offered only in the Summit Reserve 4X4 trim.

The Grand Cherokee L is available in five trim levels: Laredo (and Laredo X), Altitude (and Altitude X), Limited, Overland, and Summit (and Summit Reserve). While all models include a 3.6 L Pentastar V6 gasoline engine producing and (now assisted by the eTorque Mild Hybrid system), Overland and Summit models will also offer the 5.7 L Hemi V8 gasoline engine with Multi Displacement System (MDS) rated at and of torque.

For the first time, the Grand Cherokee will offer a 950-watt, nineteen-speaker McIntosh premium amplified surround sound audio system, replacing the previous 825-watt, eighteen-speaker Harman Kardon system on the Grand Cherokee WK2. Other new features available for the first time on a Grand Cherokee include massaging front seats, a rear seat view camera, a surround-view (360-degree) camera system, an inside fam cam for viewing different seats, a rearview camera digital mirror, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, Qi-compatible wireless device charging, a passenger side screen with HDMI interface, heated and ventilated second-row seats, second-row captain&#x27;s chairs, twenty-one inch tires and wheels, Level 2 semi-autonomous driving technology, and power-folding second and third-row seats.

For 2021, the Grand Cherokee L, along with the all-new 2022 two-row Grand Cherokee, received the front passenger interactive touchscreen display, which was first introduced on the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Integrated into the woodgrain trim on the passenger side of the dashboard, the widescreen display with HDMI interface allows the passenger to stream music wirelessly via Bluetooth to the vehicle&#x27;s audio system, view the GPS navigation map, and send destinations directly to the central touchscreen display&#x27;s navigation system. The display features a special coating that allows only the front passenger to view it while the vehicle is in motion.

=== Grand Cherokee ===
Originally scheduled to be released for the 2021 model year, but delayed until 2022, The two-row Grand Cherokee is available in seven trim levels: Laredo, Altitude, Limited, Overland, Trailhawk, Summit, and Summit Reserve (the off-road-oriented Trailhawk trim will not be available on the long wheelbase Grand Cherokee L model). Compared to the previous generation two-row Grand Cherokee, the total passenger volume increases by , while cargo space is up .

Engine choices are carried over from the previous generation Grand Cherokee (WK2), with two naturally-aspirated units, but also added a turbocharged gasoline/electric plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain.

The base engine on all non-PHEV Grand Cherokees is the 3.6 L Pentastar V6 gasoline engine, producing , and of torque.

The optional engine, available on all non-PHEV Grand Cherokee trims aside from the Laredo, Altitude, and Limited, is the 5.7 L Hemi V8 gasoline engine with the Multi Displacement System (MDS) cylinder deactivation system, producing , and of torque. When equipped with the 5.7 L HEMI V8 gasoline engine, the all-new Grand Cherokee has a maximum towing capacity of . However, the 2023 models no longer offer this V8 option.

The 4xe PHEV powertrain, first available in Jeep Wrangler (JL), is introduced to the Grand Cherokee in this generation. It is available on the Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit, and Summit Reserve trim levels. It uses an electrically assisted 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder making a total of and . The 17 kWh battery pack provides an estimated of range when running solely on electric power. It has the ability to tow . Starting from 2023 models, Trailhawk trim will only available in 4xe PHEV.

All engines, including the PHEV powertrain, are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, with Stellantis manufacturing the 850RE transmission for the 3.6 L model, and ZF manufacturing the 8HP70 transmission for the 5.7 L model (all transmissions are based on the design of the ZF 8HP transmission, and use a new rotary controller in the center console). In addition to rear-wheel-drive, three different four-wheel-drive systems are available, and use a new Selec-Terrain toggle controller (the Quadra Drive II four-wheel-drive system also features the Quadra-Lift air suspension system. The Quadra-Lift system can raise or lower the vehicle to different heights, and is standard on all Trailhawk models.

At the 2022 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS), Jeep introduced the 2022 Grand Cherokee 4xe High Altitude Edition Package. Available on both Summit and Summit Reserve trims, the High Altitude Edition Package features dark exterior accents, and unique 21-inch wheels. Following the introduction of the Grand Cherokee 4xe, the High Altitude Edition Package will also be available on the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L in both Summit and Summit Reserve trims. A new exterior color, Hydro Blue Pearlcoat, will also be available on most Grand Cherokee, Grand Cherokee 4xe, and Grand Cherokee L models.

===Fuel system integrity===
In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into 1993–2004 model year Jeep Grand Cherokees which involves the fuel tanks of these SUVs. In moderate- to high-energy rear collisions, the fuel tank (located behind the rear axle) could be compromised structurally, resulting in fuel leakage and fire. The NHTSA claims that it has reports of 157 deaths resulting from fires caused by Grand Cherokees crashing. Also affected are 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty models and 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee models, which totals about 5.1 million affected vehicles.

In June 2013, Chrysler Corporation responded to the recall, agreeing to recall 2.7 million Jeeps, though eliminating both the 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) and 1999–2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ from the recall. The recall will include 2.7 million 1993–1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ and 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty KJ vehicles.

Two weeks prior to this recall, Chrysler Corporation claimed that the affected Jeep vehicles were safe, citing the vehicles&#x27; rates of fatal rear-impact crashes involving fire as well as their compliance with then-current requirements of FMVSS standard No. 301, though agreed to recall the affected vehicles later. To remedy the problem, Jeep dealerships will install a trailer hitch onto the rear bumpers of the vehicles that will protect the fuel tank if the vehicle is involved in a rear impact. If an affected vehicle is not currently equipped with a trailer hitch, one will be installed onto it, and older Jeep and non-factory aftermarket trailer hitches will be replaced with one from Chrysler Corporation. Despite the recall, the market for these Jeep vehicles has not suffered.

===Transfer case actuator===
In May 2013 there was a recall of WKs with the Quadra-Drive II and Quadra-Trac II systems. This followed cases of cars rolling away due to the transfer case moving into neutral of its own accord, and the owner not having applied the parking brake. The recall revised the Final Drive Control Module (FDCM) software. However, following the recall, there were widespread reports on enthusiast websites of both the neutral and low ratio modes of the transfer case ceasing to function, and a survey showed that fewer than 10% of respondents had experienced no issues with the recall. Attempting to resolve these issues, some dealers subsequently replaced the transfer case actuator, FDCM, and even the transfer case itself, often at customer expense and usually to no avail.

The cause of the roll-aways was faulty soldering in the transfer case actuator. It has been deduced that the revised software detects this by noting any deviation in resistance, and thereupon locks the transfer case in the high ratio for safety; but that it is overreacting to minor resistance variations from other causes. Originally Chrysler dealers claimed that the loss of neutral and low ratio following the recall was a coincidence; then it claimed that the revised software was revealing pre-existing faults in the system, despite it occurring even with new parts. Chrysler has also claimed that only a small fraction of cars have issues following the recall; but most users never have occasion to use the low ratio and may never discover the fault. Four years after this recall its issues remain unresolved.

===Transmission parking pawl===
In April 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered a recall of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and other cars that use an electronic gear shifter because it sometimes does not go into (or does not remain in) the park position, despite the operator&#x27;s best intentions. Consumers reported that they put the car in park and left the engine running, and then were surprised when the car rolled away under power.

An investigation by FCA US and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found some drivers have exited their vehicles without first selecting &quot;PARK.&quot; Such behavior may pose a safety risk if a vehicle&#x27;s engine is still running. The company is aware of 41 injuries that are potentially related. It was also the cause of actor Anton Yelchin&#x27;s death. The vehicles involved in these events were inspected and no evidence of equipment failure was found. The vehicles also deliver warning chimes and alert messages if their driver-side doors are opened while their engines are still running and &quot;PARK&quot; is not engaged. However, the investigation suggested these measures may be insufficient to deter some drivers from exiting their vehicles without selecting &quot;PARK,&quot; so FCA US will enhance the warnings and transmission-shift strategy on these vehicles. The enhancements will combine warnings with a transmission-shift strategy to automatically prevent a vehicle from moving, under certain circumstances, even if the driver fails to select &quot;PARK.&quot;

The final fix was Safety Recall S27 / NHTSA 16V-240, a software update that adds an &quot;auto park&quot; feature that will automatically put the vehicle in park if the driver&#x27;s door is opened and the driver seatbelt is unlatched while the vehicle is stopped or moving slowly.

Jeep has now replaced the shifter with a conventional lever which stays in position for late-2016 models.

===Other recalls===
In July 2017, 2012–14 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs were recalled due to possible alternator failure. If the alternator fails, the vehicle may stall and/or if the alternator has a short circuit, a fire may occur.

In October 2017, 2011–14 model year Grand Cherokees were recalled due to improperly installed brake shields in some vehicles.

On February 25, 2022, Stellantis and Jeep issued a stop-sale order for 2022 Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L models in dealership inventory. The order was issued after it was discovered that the Radio Frequency Hub Module (RFHM) would cause some vehicles to not recognize the key fob, rendering the vehicles unable to start. This would require the vehicles to be towed to the dealership. This order only affected a limited number of vehicles, and parts were shipped to dealerships as soon as they became available.

<text>Al-Mishraq, or Mishraq Sulphur State Company, is a state run sulfur plant near Mosul, Iraq.

It has twice been set alight and burned for prolonged periods. In 2003, what is thought to have been a deliberately started fire, burned for about three weeks, resulting in the largest human-made release of sulfur dioxide ever recorded. In 2016 it was set alight by ISIL and burned for seven days.

==Fires==
In June 2003, it was the site of the largest human-made release of sulfur dioxide ever recorded when a fire (thought to have been deliberately started) gained control and burned for about three weeks. At its height, the fire was putting 21,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a day into the atmosphere. The pollution in Mosul, which is about 45 kilometres from Mishraq, reached a catastrophic level. For over 48 hours the white smoke from sulfur dioxide could be seen in the air. Many people were taken into hospitals and most vegetation was killed.

On 22 October 2016 the plant was set alight by ISIL militants as part of the Battle of Mosul. Two civilians died and nearly 1,000 people were treated for toxic gas inhalation. Shifting winds sent the gas to Qayyarah Airfield West, where U.S. and coalition forces were forced to use gas masks. The total mass of the released sulfur dioxide was estimated to approximately 161,000 tons distributed over seven days, equivalent to a small volcanic eruption.

<doc id="1105729" wikidata="Q3514538" url="?curid=1105729" title="Tall bike">
<text>A tall bike is an unusually tall bicycle often constructed by hobbyists from spare parts. Typically, two conventional bicycle frames are connected by welding, brazing, or other means, one atop the other. The drive train is reconfigured to connect to the upper set of pedals, and the controls are moved to the upper handlebar area.

Alternatively, a bicycle can be built by inverting the frame, inserting the fork from the &#x27;wrong side&#x27;, flipping the rear wheel, adding a long gooseneck and tall handlebars, then welding an extended seat post tube to the &#x27;bottom&#x27; (now the top) of the frame. This type of tall bike is made with only one bike frame and is often called an &quot;upside-down bike&quot; rather than a tall bike, though the seat can be pretty high, depending on the frame shape used. This type is safer, as there is less tubing between the rider&#x27;s legs and dismounting in a hurry can be easily accomplished.

Finally, a tall bike frame can be made from scratch.

== Practical uses ==
Tall bikes are usually used for recreation and entertainment but can also be used for general transportation. Regular tall-bike commuters note that their increased visibility and the simple &#x27;wow factor&#x27; give them a safety advantage in automobile traffic over &#x27;short bikes.&#x27; However, there are issues with mounting and dismounting similar to those presented by penny-farthings.

== History ==
Historically, one of the first practical uses of the tall bike was as a late 19th-century lamp lighting system, by which a worker would mount a specialized tall bicycle while equipped with a torch for lighting gas lamps. As the workers rode to each lamp, they would lean against the lamp post, light it, and then ride to the next. Upon completing the lamp circuit, an assistant will help the rider dismount. For this reason, the term &#x27;lamplighter&#x27; is still sometimes used to refer to a very tall bicycle.

== Sporting ==

Tall bike jousting is a popular sport among tall bike owners and is commonly considered to have been introduced by Jake Houle and Lil&#x27; Bob of the Hard Times/Black Label Bike Club. Combatants arm themselves with lances and attempt to score points by dislodging the other rider. Rules vary by area and with the mood of the combatants. Like all jousting games, participants consider it a sport in which honor plays a role and dishonorable wins are frowned upon.

Jousters create lances that vary from simple PVC pipe and foam devices that are flexible, soft, and relatively safe, up to wooden or metal lances that may be quite dangerous. Regional rules vary, some specifying flaming lances for effect, or glass containers attached to the end, the goal being to break the glass container to score points.

== Design considerations ==

Tall bikes present some interesting design considerations, and different localities tend to have different methods of dealing with them.

One consistent issue is that the seat tends to end up in line with, or behind, the rear axle, which creates a powerful tendency to lift the front wheel of the bicycle on acceleration. Some bicycle builders simply accept this tendency, but others solve the problem by moving the seat post forward, lowering the handlebars, moving the rear wheel backward, or by using a smaller wheel in front, typically a 24&quot; instead of a 26&quot;.

Stability can also be negatively affected, and enhancements such as extended wheelbase by welding extensions on the front and rear dropouts can benefit stability. Contest holders often place restrictions on such modification to prevent unfair advantages.

See the bicycle and motorcycle geometry and bicycle and motorcycle dynamics articles for more on these issues.

==Clubs==

Tall bikes are a popular mode of transportation for such notable modern &#x27;bicycle clubs&#x27; as Midnight Ridazz, Angelopes, SCUL, Zoobomb, Rat Patrol, Black Label Bicycle Club, The Winking Circle, C.h.u.n.k. 666, Cyclecide, and activist groups.

They are also a mainstay among builders of clown bikes, art bikes, clown alleys and parade groups.

<doc id="1105739" wikidata="Q683445" url="?curid=1105739" title="Paul Scott (novelist)">
<text>Paul Mark Scott (25 March 1920 1 March 1978) was an English novelist best known for his tetralogy &quot;The Raj Quartet.&quot; In the last years of his life, his novel &quot;Staying On&quot; won the Booker Prize (1977). The series of books was dramatised by Granada Television during the 1980s and won Scott the public and critical acclaim that he had not received during his lifetime.

Born in suburban London, Scott was posted to India, Burma and Malaya during World War II. On return to London he worked as a notable literary agent, before deciding to write full time from 1960. In 1964 he returned to India for a research trip, though he was struggling with ill health and alcoholism. From the material gathered he created the novels that would become &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;. In the final years of his life he accepted a visiting professorship at the University of Tulsa, where much of his private archive is held.

==Early life==
Paul Scott was born at 130 Fox Lane in the district of Palmers Green/Southgate, in North London, the younger of two sons. His father, Thomas (1870–1958), was a Yorkshireman who moved to London in the 1920s with family members from Headingley. He was a commercial artist, specialising in drawing for calendars and cards. Scott&#x27;s mother, Frances, née Mark (1886–1969) was the daughter of a labourer from south London. In later life Scott noted the tension in himself between the pull of his mother&#x27;s creative ambition and his father&#x27;s real world, grounded approach to life.

Scott was educated at the private Winchmore Hill Collegiate School, but had to leave early, without any qualifications, as his father&#x27;s business met financial difficulties. This division from his studies was mirrored through the rest of his life—the battle between the demands of practical needs versus the urge to create. Scott worked as an accounts clerk for C. T. Payne and took evening classes in book-keeping and wrote poetry in his spare time. He later noted that the rigid social hierarchies and codes of his suburban childhood he found echoed in British Indian society.

==Military service==
Scott was conscripted into the British Army as a private soldier early in 1940, with the British Intelligence Department. He trained as a private in Torquay with the 8th Battalion, the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment). During this time two of his aunts were killed in an air raid. 

In 1943, at the age of 22, Scott was posted as a commissioned officer in the British Indian Army, and he sailed on the &quot;Athlone Castle&quot; from Liverpool that year. He quickly came down with amoebic dysentery, not diagnosed until 1964. The disease may have had some effect on his character and writing. He joined the Indian Army Service Corps and became familiar with life at hill stations such as Abbottabad and Murree. He made many close friendships with Indian comrades, and literary portraits of his friends appear in his works from this point. 

He later helped to organise the logistic support for the Fourteenth Army&#x27;s reconquest of Burma. After the fall of Rangoon in 1945 he spent time in Calcutta and Kashmir, later posted to Malaya to end the Japanese occupation; they had, however, already surrendered by the time Scott arrived. In his time away from India he missed the country deeply and longed to return. At the end of the year he rejoined his company at Bihar and sailed back to England, having spent three years in India. During his service, he continued to write poetry.

==Career==

In 1941, before his military posting, Scott had published a collection of three religious poems entitled &quot;I, Gerontius&quot;, as part of the Resuram Series of pamphlets. He wrote for &quot;Country Life&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. His work was included in &quot;Poetry Quarterly&quot; and the poetry anthology &quot;Poems of this War&quot; (1942). In 1948 he published &quot;Pillars of Salt&quot; in a collection of &quot;Four Jewish Plays.&quot;

After demobilisation in 1946, Scott was employed in the two small publishing houses, Falcon Press and Grey Walls Press, headed by the Conservative MP Peter Baker.

In 1950 Scott joined Pearn, Pollinger &amp; Higham as a literary agent (later to split into Pollinger Limited and David Higham Associates) and subsequently became a director. He was described as caring and dedicated in his work: &quot;a prince among agents&quot;. Whilst there, authors he covered included Arthur C. Clarke, Morris West, M. M. Kaye, Elizabeth David, Mervyn Peake and Muriel Spark. One biographer notes that as an agent, Scott &quot;sheltered nervous talents, supported frail ones, pruned back bogus growth, detected and cherished genuine achievement in the wildest and most undisciplined bolters.&quot;

Scott&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Johnny Sahib&quot;, met with 17 rejections from publishers. It was eventually released in 1952, coming to win the Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode Literary Fellowship Prize. He continued to work as a literary agent to support his family, but managed to publish regularly. &quot;The Alien Sky&quot; (US title, &quot;Six Days in Marapore&quot;) appeared in 1953, and was followed by &quot;A Male Child&quot; (1956), &quot;The Mark of the Warrior&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Chinese Love Pavilion&quot; (1960). He also wrote radio plays for the BBC: &quot;Lines of Communication&quot; (1952), &quot;Sahibs and Memsahibs&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Mark of the Warrior&quot; (1960). 

In 1960 Scott walked away from his steady job as an agent and decided to become a full-time author. He played with various geographic settings in &quot;Bender&quot; (1963) and &quot;Corrida at San Feliu&quot; (1964) with uneasy results. Funded by his publishers, Heinemann, Scott flew to India in 1964, in a last ditch effort to found a career as a successful novelist and, thereby, solvency. He drew there material for his next five novels, all set in India during and immediately after World War II, in the period leading to independence and Partition. For him, the British Raj was his extended metaphor. He wrote &quot;I don&#x27;t think a writer chooses his metaphors. They choose him.&quot;

During his stay in Bombay he was hosted by Dorothy Ganapathy, whom he was close to for the rest of his life. He spent time in rural Andhra Pradesh with military comrades. His long standing gastric illness was exacerbated by the visit to India, and on his return he had to undergo painful treatment, but afterwards felt better than he had for many years and began to write.

In June 1964, aged 43, Scott began to write &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, the first novel of what was to become &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; (1966). The remaining novels in the sequence were published over the next nine years: &quot;The Day of the Scorpion&quot; (1968), &quot;The Towers of Silence&quot; (1971) and &quot;A Division of the Spoils&quot; (1975). Scott wrote in relative isolation and only visited India twice more during the genesis of &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;, in 1968 and in 1972, latterly for the British Council. He worked in an upstairs room at his home in Hampstead overlooking the garden and Hampstead Garden Suburb woodland. He supplemented his earnings from his books with reviews for &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;Country Life.&quot;

Scott&#x27;s daughter noted, &quot;It was as if he had exiled himself to the one room where there was nothing but the typewriter and the blank page... It was the making of him as a writer, but the unmaking of him as a human being.&quot;

In 1976 and 1977, the last two years of his life, Scott was invited to be a visiting professor at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. The financial offer was a great relief after his endless financial anxieties of his writing career. The University of Texas supported the author by offering to buy his manuscripts. His coda to &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;, &quot;Staying On&quot;, was published in 1977, just before his second visit to Tulsa. &quot;Staying On&quot; won the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; Fiction Award and the Booker Prize in 1977. Scott was too unwell to attend the Booker ceremony in November 1977. 

==Adaptations==
Granada Television showed &quot;Staying On&quot;, with Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson as Tusker Smalley and his wife Lucy. The success of its first showing in Britain in December 1981 encouraged Granada to embark on the much greater project of making &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; into a major 14-part television series known as &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, first broadcast in the United Kingdom in early 1984 and subsequently in the United States and many Commonwealth countries. It was rebroadcast in the UK in 1997 as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of Indian independence, and in 2001 the British Film Institute voted it 22nd in the all-time best British television programmes. It was also adapted as a nine-part BBC Radio 4 dramatisation under its original title in 2005.

==Legacy==
While Scott was teaching creative writing at the University of Tulsa in 1976, he arranged to sell his private correspondence to that university&#x27;s McFarlin Library, thus making available some 6,000 personal letters. The materials begin in 1940, when Scott was enlisted in the British Army, and end only a few days before his death on 1 March 1978.

In the David Higham Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin can be found Scott&#x27;s correspondence with clients Arthur C. Clarke, M. M. Kaye, Muriel Spark, children&#x27;s author Mary Patchett, Peter Green, Morris West, Gabriel Fielding and John Braine.

Hilary Spurling wrote a full biography of Scott in 1991. Janis Haswell edited a two-volume collection of Scott’s letters; &quot;Volume I, The Early Years (1940–1965)&quot; covers the military period of his life and the first stage of his career, before the quartet of novels was published. &quot;Volume II, The Quartet and Beyond (1966–1978)&quot; covers the end of his life.

== Personal life ==
In Torquay in 1941 Scott met and married his wife Penny (born Nancy Edith Avery in 1914). At the time she was a nurse at the Rosehill Children&#x27;s Hospital; she later wrote four novels as Elizabeth Avery between 1959 and 1963; she died in 2005. They had two daughters, Carol (born 1947) and Sally (born 1948).

Towards the end of his life, Scott stated to his doctor that he was &quot;eating little, sleeping less, and drinking a quart of vodka a day.&quot; Writer Peter Green wrote of his meeting with Scott: &quot;In 1975, though still only in his mid-fifties, he was a dying man, and knew it. He was &quot;an alcoholic wreck.&quot; Scott&#x27;s wife Penny had supported him throughout the writing of &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;, despite his heavy drinking and violent behaviour, but once it was complete she left him and filed for divorce.

In 1977, while he was in Tulsa, Scott was diagnosed with colon cancer. He died at the Middlesex Hospital in London on 1 March 1978.

<doc id="1105740" wikidata="Q3435643" url="?curid=1105740" title="Ulster Covenant">
<text>Ulster&#x27;s Solemn League and Covenant, commonly known as the Ulster Covenant, was signed by nearly 500,000 people on and before 28 September 1912, in protest against the Third Home Rule Bill introduced by the British Government in the same year.

== Signing ==
The Covenant was first drafted by Thomas Sinclair, a prominent unionist and businessman from Belfast. Sir Edward Carson was the first person to sign the Covenant at Belfast City Hall with a silver pen, followed by The 6th Marquess of Londonderry (the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland), representatives of the Protestant churches, and then by Sir James Craig. The signatories, 471,414 in all, were all against the establishment of a Home Rule parliament in Dublin. The Ulster Covenant is immortalised in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;. On 23 September 1912, the Ulster Unionist Council voted in favour of a resolution pledging itself to the Covenant.

The Covenant had two basic parts: the Covenant signed by 237,368 men and the Declaration signed by 234,046 women. Both the Covenant and Declaration are held by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). An online searchable database is available on the PRONI website.

In January 1913, the Ulster Volunteers aimed to recruit 100,000 men aged from 17 to 65 who had signed the Covenant as a unionist militia.

A British Covenant, similar to the Ulster Covenant in opposition to the Home Rule Bill, received two million signatures in 1914.

28 September is today known as &quot;Ulster Day&quot; to unionists.

== &quot;The Covenant&quot; (for men) ==

BEING CONVINCED in our consciences that Home Rule would be disastrous to the material well-being of Ulster as well as of the whole of Ireland, subversive of our civil and religious freedom, destructive of our citizenship, and perilous to the unity of the Empire, we, whose names are underwritten, men of Ulster, loyal subjects of His Gracious Majesty King George V, humbly relying on the God whom our fathers in days of stress and trial confidently trusted, do hereby pledge ourselves in solemn Covenant, throughout this our time of threatened calamity, to stand by one another in defending, for ourselves and our children, our cherished position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. And in the event of such a Parliament being forced upon us, we further solemnly and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its authority. In sure confidence that God will defend the right, we hereto subscribe our names.
And further, we individually declare that we have not already signed this Covenant.
== &quot;The Declaration&quot; (for women) ==

We, whose names are underwritten, women of Ulster, and loyal subjects of our gracious King, being firmly persuaded that Home Rule would be disastrous to our Country, desire to associate ourselves with the men of Ulster in their uncompromising opposition to the Home Rule Bill now before Parliament, whereby it is proposed to drive Ulster out of her cherished place in the Constitution of the United Kingdom, and to place her under the domination and control of a Parliament in Ireland.
Praying that from this calamity God will save Ireland, we hereto subscribe our names.
==Demographics==
The majority of the signatories of the Covenant were from Ulster, although the signing was also attended by several thousand southern unionists.

Acknowledging this, Carson paid tribute to &quot;my own fellow citizens from Dublin, from Wicklow, from Clare [and], yes, from Cork, rebel Cork, who are now holding the hand of Ulster&quot;, to cheers from the crowd.

Robert James Stewart, a Presbyterian from Drum, County Monaghan, and the grandfather of Heather Humphreys, the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in the Ireland, was one of around 6,000 signatories in County Monaghan, where one quarter of the population was Protestant before the establishment of the Irish Free State. Almost 18,000 people signed either the Covenant or the Declaration in County Donegal.

== Signed-in-blood dispute ==
The signature of Frederick Hugh Crawford was claimed by him to have been written in blood. However, this is disputed. Based on the results of a forensic test that he carried out in September 2012 at PRONI, Dr. Alastair Ruffell of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast has asserted that he is 90% positive that the signature is not blood. Crawford&#x27;s signature was injected with a small amount of luminol; this substance reacts with iron in blood&#x27;s haemoglobin to produce a blue-white glow. The test is very sensitive and can detect tiny traces even in old samples. Crawford&#x27;s signature is still a rich red colour today which would be unlikely if it had been blood. Nevertheless, some unionists are not convinced by the evidence.

==Solemn League and Covenant==
The term &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot; recalled a key historic document signed in 1643, by which the Scottish Covenanters made a political and military alliance with the leaders of the English Parliamentarians during the First English Civil War.

==Natal Covenant==
The Ulster Covenant was used as a template for the &quot;Natal Covenant&quot;, signed in 1955 by 33,000 British-descended Natalians against the nationalist South African government&#x27;s intention of declaring the Union a republic. It was signed in Durban&#x27;s City Hall – itself loosely based on Belfast&#x27;s, so that the Ulster scene was almost exactly reproduced.


Being convinced in our consciences that a republic would be disastrous to the material well-being of Natal as well as of the whole of South Africa, subversive of our freedom and destructive of our citizenship, we, whose names are underwritten, men and women of Natal, loyal subjects of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, do hereby pledge ourselves in solemn covenant, throughout this our time of threatened calamity, to stand by one another in defending the Crown, and in using all means which may be found possible and necessary to defeat the present intention to set up a republic in South Africa. And in the event of a republic being forced upon us, we further solemnly and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its authority. In sure confidence that God will defend the right, we hereto subscribe our names. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.

<text>Panasonic Toyota Racing was a Formula One team owned by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation and based in Cologne, Germany. Toyota announced their plans to join Formula One in 1999, and after extensive testing with their initial car, dubbed the TF101, the team made their debut in 2002. The new team grew from Toyota&#x27;s long-standing Toyota Motorsport GmbH organisation, which had previously competed in the World Rally Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Despite a point in their first-ever race, Toyota never won a Grand Prix, their best finish being second, which they achieved five times.

Toyota drew criticism for their lack of success, as they never managed to win a Grand Prix with one of the sport&#x27;s biggest budgets along with being the world&#x27;s largest car manufacturer. Toyota was a well-funded team, but despite this, strong results had never been consistent.

On 4 November 2009, Toyota announced its immediate withdrawal from Formula One, ending the team&#x27;s involvement in the sport after eight consecutive seasons.

On 11 October 2024, Toyota announced a technical support deal with the Haas F1 Team, which would continue to receive power units and other components from Ferrari.

==Racing history==

===1957–2002: origins===
Toyota made an early entrance into motorsport when a Toyopet Crown entered the Round Australia Trial in 1957. The Formula One team&#x27;s roots can be traced to a later development in 1972, when Swede Ove Andersson&#x27;s Andersson Motorsport team used a Toyota Celica 1600GT in the RAC Rally in Great Britain. The team was later renamed &quot;Toyota Team Europe&quot; and then, after being bought by Toyota in 1993, &quot;Toyota Motorsport GmbH&quot;. The rally team won four World Rally Championship drivers&#x27; titles, most notably with Carlos Sainz, as well as three constructors&#x27; titles. The FIA banned the team from competition for 12 months at the end of 1995 for running illegal parts, causing the team unable to race at next season (Toyota&#x27;s official regional teams entered the Celica GT-Four the next season, but the suspension meant they were ineligible for manufacturer&#x27;s points). Toyota continued to win rallies after their return in 1997, but did not achieve the same level of dominance.
In 1997 the team moved into track racing with a sports car project, twice failing to win the Le Mans 24 Hours. On 21 January 1999 Toyota announced its move into Formula One. The company ended its rallying and Le Mans programs in order to concentrate on Formula One. On 30 June 2000 the team secured its place as the 12th entry for the Formula One season. Originally intending to enter F1 in 2001, Toyota forfeited an $11 million deposit by delaying their entry. Unusually, Toyota opted to start their own works team rather than partner with a specialist race team and chassis manufacturer. The team was also set up away from Formula One&#x27;s traditional manufacturing centre in &quot;Motorsport Valley&quot; in the United Kingdom. During 2001, Toyota tested with their prototype TF101 (AM01) car and drivers at 11 F1 circuits. The idea was to gain telemetry data for the races, which allowed them to make aerodynamic changes for the TF102, and for the drivers to experience the tracks in the new cars. Finn Mika Salo, who can communicate in Japanese, and Scotsman Allan McNish, who drove the GT-One during the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, were appointed as test drivers.

===2002–2004: early years===

====2002====
Toyota F1 made their Formula One debut in , with McNish and Salo driving the Toyota TF102, designed by Gustav Brunner. Despite reportedly having one of the biggest budgets in Formula One, Toyota scored only two points all year. Their first point was scored in their first race, the Australian Grand Prix, when half the field was eliminated by a first corner accident caused by Ralf Schumacher colliding with Rubens Barrichello. The team could have scored another point in the next race at the Malaysian Grand Prix, but Salo suffered an electrical misfire and the team fumbled McNish&#x27;s pit stop. The Scot thus lost ground, and finished seventh, just out of the points, behind Sauber&#x27;s Felipe Massa. The Brazilian Grand Prix, third race of the season, yielded Toyota&#x27;s second and final point, once again scored by Salo. McNish endured a huge crash during practice for the end-of-season Japanese Grand Prix and missed the race on medical advice. Neither McNish nor Salo were offered a race seat for 2003.

====2003====
For the season, Toyota signed Brazilian Cristiano da Matta, who had won the American ChampCar series the previous year using a Toyota powered car, and former BAR driver Olivier Panis to take over the racing duties from Salo and McNish. A wider points system were just what Toyota needed to score points in 2003. The team managed several points finishes during the season, but only as high as fifth place in Germany. 

High points of the season included Toyotas running first and second in the British Grand Prix, thanks to making their pit stops whilst the safety car was out, and Panis qualifying third at the US Grand Prix. At the end of the season, the team had accumulated sixteen points, an improvement on the previous season, but still only 8th in the constructors&#x27; championship, ahead of the struggling Jordan Grand Prix team and Minardi.

====2004====
Toyota retained their driver line-up for , but the season proved difficult. Both Toyotas (together with Williams cars) were disqualified from the Canadian Grand Prix for running illegal parts. Cristiano da Matta, following disappointing performances, left the team after the German Grand Prix and was replaced by fellow Brazilian Ricardo Zonta, who had been the team&#x27;s third driver. Zonta drove for Toyota for the subsequent four rounds, before being replaced by Italian Jarno Trulli, who had left the Renault works team. Panis, meanwhile, announced his retirement from racing, and bowed out before the final race of the season in Brazil to allow Zonta, who had stepped aside for Trulli, to compete in his home race. Neither Trulli nor Zonta scored points for the team in those late season races, although Trulli qualified well in both Grands Prix he took part in. Toyota brought in ex-Jordan and Renault designer Mike Gascoyne early in the year to oversee the development of the car, which improved during the year. The team scored just over half the points they scored in 2003, but equalled their best finish of fifth at the United States Grand Prix with Panis and maintained their 8th place in the constructors&#x27; championship.

====Industrial espionage====
2004 also saw Toyota being accused of industrial espionage in the case of stolen data files from Ferrari. This following a season where many Formula One fans commented on similarities of the Toyota TF104 to the Ferrari F2003-GA. The district attorney of Cologne, where Toyota F1 is based, led the investigation saying &quot;It&#x27;s an immense amount of material. We’d need over 10 thousand pages to print everything,&quot; in relation to the number of documents generated in the design of any modern F1 car. Toyota refused to send the data back to Italy because they did not want Ferrari to take advantage of their own data, which had been mixed in with Ferrari&#x27;s.

===2005–2006: rise, success, decline and customer engine partnership expansion===
====2005====
 saw an improvement in Toyota&#x27;s fortunes. The team retained Trulli for the season but replaced Zonta with race-winner Ralf Schumacher from Williams. During the team&#x27;s launch for their 2005 car, the TF105, Schumacher said that he had a better chance of winning the title at Toyota than he ever did at Williams. The team also supplied leased customer engines to the Jordan team. Toyota made a good start to the season, with Jarno Trulli qualifying second at the opening round in Australia and finishing second at the following two races in Malaysia and Bahrain. Results petered away slightly from this point, with Trulli scoring his only other podium with 3rd place at Spain and Ralf Schumacher rewarding the squad with 3rd place at both Hungary and China and a pole position at the Japanese Grand Prix. Nevertheless, the 2005 season was Toyota&#x27;s most successful Formula One season by far, as they scored points in all but the opening race and the controversial United States Grand Prix, where Trulli qualified in pole position, but like all the drivers using Michelin tyres, retired before the start of the race.

====2006====
Toyota retained the same driver line-up for , although it switched to Bridgestone tyres. The team was the first to unveil their new car, a move intended to give them an advantage over their rivals, but the car&#x27;s performance in testing was average. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s third place in Australia was Toyota&#x27;s only podium finish during 2006. Their highest race finishes thereafter were 4th at France with Schumacher and also at the Brickyard, where Trulli started from the back and fought his way through to beat champion Fernando Alonso&#x27;s Renault. Trulli came close to another podium in Monaco, but his engine failed during the late stages of the race. Ralf finished 6th at the Hungarian GP, as the only other significant result for the team. Jarno Trulli suffered a slight problem, and was off the pace during the team&#x27;s home race (the Japanese Grand Prix) which delayed team-mate Ralf Schumacher on course for a strong result. In the final race – the Brazilian Grand Prix – both of Toyota&#x27;s cars retired in the early laps with suspension failures. Despite these setbacks, the team enjoyed the second-best season performance in their history, scoring 35 points and finishing in sixth place, one point behind BMW Sauber.

Toyota surprised the Formula One community by dropping Mike Gascoyne from their technical department after the Melbourne race, especially as the Englishman had contributed to their rise in competitiveness during . However, the poor performances of the TF106 in the opening two races of the season, particularly in Bahrain where the team had finished on the podium 12 months earlier, prompted disagreement over the team&#x27;s technical direction. Gascoyne disliked the corporate way the team&#x27;s management operated while team management were unimpressed by the TF106 car Gascoyne had produced and he was duly dismissed. It took a while for Toyota to replace the technical director, eventually promoting Pascal Vasselon to the role, saying that a technical department run by one man alone was becoming old fashioned.

===2007–2009: association with Williams and final seasons===

====2007====


Trulli and Schumacher were retained by Toyota for . The Toyota TF107 was officially launched on 12 January 2007 in Cologne, Germany. Toyota began their winter testing programme in Valencia on 29 January 2007. Toyota enjoyed a competitive start to the pre-season testing at the Valencia circuit. Toyota&#x27;s supply of customer engines was moved from the Midland F1 team to British former constructors&#x27; champions Williams who had, by their own standards, underperformed with Cosworth engines during 2006.

Ralf Schumacher scored Toyota&#x27;s first point of the season with 8th place in the year&#x27;s opening Grand Prix in Melbourne. Jarno Trulli scored two points in each of the next two races, finishing 7th at both Malaysia and Bahrain. Schumacher struggled in those races, finishing no higher than 12th. During the four-week break that followed the third round, Toyota tested at the Circuit de Catalunya, where the team stated improvements were made. Team president John Howett said Toyota were looking to close down on third-placed team BMW Sauber in the constructors&#x27; standings, having maintained 5th since Malaysia. However, the team failed to score any points over the next two races.

The Canadian Grand Prix ended their points drought. Ralf Schumacher scored a point for finishing 8th, and at the following event at Indianapolis, Trulli finished in 6th place. Schumacher meanwhile, was involved in a crash with David Coulthard and Rubens Barrichello at the opening corner.

A run of incidents meant the team did not score points until the Hungarian Grand Prix. Here Schumacher scored 3 points after he qualified in 5th place and finished 6th.

On 1 October, Schumacher announced that he would be leaving Toyota at the end of the 2007 season for a new challenge, having not been offered a new contract.

Toyota ended the year with an 8th-place finish at Interlagos for Jarno Trulli. Altogether, 13 points were scored, the team&#x27;s lowest tally since 2004 and less than they achieved in their second season. The team admitted not fulfilling their pre-season promises, and vowed to have a completely different car for 2008.

====2008====

While retaining Jarno Trulli, Toyota replaced Ralf Schumacher with reigning GP2 champion Timo Glock for the season. The team&#x27;s new car, the Toyota TF108, was launched on 10 January 2008. The team&#x27;s first points came in Sepang, where Jarno Trulli qualified in 5th place (albeit being promoted to 3rd following the McLaren team being penalised) and went on to finish the race in 4th. This proved not to be a one off, with Trulli getting 6th place next time out in Bahrain, and then 8th in Spain after some late-race trouble. After retiring in the opening two rounds followed by mid-field finishes, Timo Glock was able to secure a 4th place and 5 points for Toyota at Montreal, in addition to Trulli&#x27;s 3 points brought Toyota up 5th place in the Constructor&#x27;s standings. Each car led the race at some point. More points were to follow at France, where Trulli managed to hold off Heikki Kovalainen in the late race stages to collect 3rd place. This was Toyota&#x27;s first podium finish in over two years. Trulli dedicated this podium to former team boss Ove Andersson, who died in the week prior to the race, in a car accident. Trulli scored points in the British Grand Prix, but despite a solid showing during most of the race in Germany, neither driver scored points; Glock suffered a rear suspension failure that caused a spectacular crash, while Trulli was passed in the later stages of the race. The team&#x27;s fortunes looked up in Hungary, where Glock put in a good qualifying run that ultimately led to a second-place finish in the race, giving him his first F1 podium and Toyota&#x27;s second podium finish of the season. At the next race in Valencia, Jarno Trulli was able to gather a 5th-place finish while teammate Glock fought his way up to 7th. This result put Toyota ten points ahead of Renault in the constructors&#x27; standings.

At the next race in Belgium Trulli struggled, only being able to finish 16th, as his gearbox was damaged in a collision with Sébastien Bourdais&#x27; Toro Rosso on the first lap. Timo Glock, on the other hand, was doing as badly as Trulli until a few laps before the end of the race the rain came down. Glock changed to wet tyres, and was able to move up the order to 8th place. After the race, however, Glock was penalised 25-seconds for overtaking Mark Webber under yellow flags during the final lap of the race. The penalty pushed Glock to ninth place.

The next race took the team to Italy where they qualified well – Trulli 7th and Glock 9th. However, they were only able to manage 11th and 13th respectively in the race.

In Singapore Toyota again qualified well, Glock 8th and Trulli 11th. Trulli retired from the race with transmission problems, but Glock went on to finish 4th.

At the Japanese Grand Prix Glock retired on lap 7 with a mechanical failure, after hitting debris from David Coulthard&#x27;s crash. However, Jarno Trulli did very well, finishing 5th.

In the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix Trulli was again involved in an incident with Sébastien Bourdais on lap 1, this time forcing him out of the race. Glock meanwhile maintained his strong late-season form, scoring two points for 7th place.

Meanwhile, in the dramatic 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix the Toyotas were the only cars to stay out on dry tyres in the torrential rainstorm in the closing stages of the race, and that had a significant factor on deciding the destiny of the world title. Trulli had qualified 2nd, but both he and Glock faded to 6th and 8th respectively at the finish, Glock relinquishing the vital fifth place to Lewis Hamilton on the final lap, which was enough for the McLaren driver to seal the world title by a point from local hero and race winner Felipe Massa. Afterwards, Glock denied conspiracy claims that he gave the place to Hamilton, citing that he was struggling for grip on the wet track surface and that there was absolutely nothing he could do.

Toyota finished 2008 with 56 points, a vast improvement on their 2007 total of 13. The team finished the year ranked 5th, improving from their 2007 standing of 6th.

====2009====

Toyota retained both Glock and Trulli for and introduced a new car, the TF109. The team began the season extremely well, scoring seven times in the first four races (including three podiums), along with a pole position in Bahrain. This early form was partly due to a loophole in the new technical regulations, as Toyota was one of only three teams to begin the season with a &quot;double diffuser&quot; design. However, the team&#x27;s form dropped off during the European leg of the season before returning for the final flyaway races. In the next nine races Toyota only managed five points finishes, with no podiums, and they were overtaken in the constructors&#x27; championship by both Ferrari and McLaren. A resurgence towards the end of the season saw Toyota claim another two podiums (in Singapore and Japan) and secure fifth place in the constructors&#x27; title, albeit without the targeted first victory. Glock was injured in a crash during qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix, and was replaced for the final two races of the season by the team&#x27;s test and reserve driver, Kamui Kobayashi.

In light of the parent company&#x27;s first ever financial loss in 2009, Toyota decided to withdraw from Formula One with immediate effect on 4 November 2009. 

Toyota&#x27;s 2010 car the TF110 was almost fully developed. There were two prepared prototype chassis of the TF110.

An agreement was reached for the Stefan Grand Prix team, which was attempting to compete in the 2010 season to take Toyota&#x27;s chassis and engines in 2010. Stefan Grand Prix also rented private office space at Toyota Motorsport GmbH, but the team was refused an entry and never competed in Formula One. The struggling HRT team tried to purchase the chassis to replace their poor performing Dallara chassis. The deal was never completed. Tyre supplier Pirelli expressed an interest in using the Toyotas as development sleds for its F1 tyres ahead of their return to the sport in 2011, but instead opted to use the race-proven T109. The first chassis TF110-01 was painted red for Stefan GP and was run in a shakedown by Kazuki Nakajima in the Toyota Motorsports headquarters car park. The same chassis was also run by Toyota F1 boss John Howett, but he reportedly crashed the car into a factory wall during a run arranged to mark his leaving of the company. The second chassis TF110-02 remained in an unpainted carbon-look, and is currently on display at Automuseum PROTOTYP in Hamburg, Germany. To this day many speculate how Toyota would have performed in 2010. Many in the industry think that race wins could have been achieved with the TF110, which featured very advanced aerodynamics.

Toyota&#x27;s grid spot in 2010 was taken by Sauber who competed under the name BMW Sauber despite BMW&#x27;s withdrawal from the sport and the team reverting to Ferrari engines.

==Engine supplier==

Jordan used Toyota engines in and when the team was re-badged as Midland F1 in , Toyota continued to supply the team with engines. Williams also used Toyota engines from to .

==Technical support to Haas==
On 11 October 2024, Haas F1 Team announced a technical partnership with Toyota that sees the team receive design, technical and manufacturing services from Toyota Gazoo Racing, while Ferrari would continue to provide power units and other components. During the announcement, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda emphasised that the deal does not signify Toyota&#x27;s full-fledged return to the sport. Instead, the company highlighted that the deal would provide an opportunity for its engineers, staff and drivers to experience Formula One. A few months later in January 2025, TGR director of global motorsport Masaya Kaji said that Toyota is looking into returning into Formula One.

==Sponsorship==

Panasonic was Toyota&#x27;s title sponsor since the team&#x27;s first season in . After Toyota&#x27;s upturn in form from , Panasonic extended its sponsorship deal. Denso (a member of Toyota Group) and Esso (a member of ExxonMobil group) were also with Toyota F1 since that first year.

==Notable drivers==
Based on a racer&#x27;s credentials, Olivier Panis could be classed as Toyota F1&#x27;s first notable driver, being their first man with a Grand Prix win to his name. However, that win was in unusual circumstances, when many of the front-runners (drivers for teams like Williams, Ferrari and Benetton) dropped out in the wet, tricky conditions. Otherwise, Panis had never driven for front-running teams, and joined Toyota in 2003 after a season with BAR that yielded just 4 points. Therefore, the following are racers of calibre who have shone for Toyota, and who have had reasonable success in F1 generally.

===Ralf Schumacher===


The German driver came to Toyota in 2005 from Williams with 6 Grand Prix wins to his name. After a 2004 season with the Grove-based team that yielded just one top-three race finish, a need for change was felt and Schumacher joined Toyota. The Japanese team had yet to score a podium finish. However he settled in comfortably.

Schumacher appeared slower than Trulli in the first few races of the season, as the latter hit the headlines as he took Toyota to new heights. But Schumacher caught up, and ended the season on top, getting two podiums, the first of which was chasing his brother Michael for 2nd place in the Hungarian race.

He struggled throughout 2006 after saying he expected Toyota to score its first win, and once again, his best result was just 3rd. Schumacher split with long term manager Willi Weber during this season, and partnered with Hans Mahr, who tried to get Schumacher back into a winning team – a move that did not work.

However Schumacher wanted to prove he was still content with being at Toyota F1 through the following close season, and said he was more likely to still win the F1 title with Toyota than any other team, and that Toyota would be the team of the future. On 1 October, Schumacher announced that he would be leaving Toyota at the end of the 2007 season for a new challenge, but did not clearly state what this challenge would be.

===Jarno Trulli===


Being Toyota&#x27;s first recruitment of a top driver and Grand Prix winner, Jarno Trulli&#x27;s move from Renault was big news. It was late during the season, and Trulli was dropped from Renault&#x27;s race line-up despite matching his team-mate Fernando Alonso, and replaced by Jacques Villeneuve. Soon after, Toyota F1 revealed that Trulli would race for them during the 2005 season and beyond. However, Olivier Panis retired from racing before the year was out, leaving a space in Toyota&#x27;s race attack, meaning Trulli was promoted earlier than anticipated. Qualifying 6th on his Toyota debut in Japan was the start of a competitive run for the team. No points were scored that year, although Trulli comfortably outpaced his team-mate Ricardo Zonta.

Trulli settled in well with Toyota, finding it easier to focus when not on tenterhooks with the Team Principal as he was with Renault&#x27;s Flavio Briatore. As such, the first spark of form that that aspect was yielding was when Trulli qualified 2nd at Melbourne – Toyota&#x27;s first front row start. He dropped off in the race with tyre trouble, but then went on to score Toyota&#x27;s first podiums in Malaysia and Bahrain.

However, a term was created in that year – the &quot;Trulli Train&quot;. This highlighted a recurring snag to Trulli&#x27;s career. It referred to when Trulli qualified in a high position, but dropped away in the races (mainly due to tyre degradation in 2005). The result was the buildup of a queue behind Trulli&#x27;s car, which was present at numerous races throughout 2005, albeit not in his podium-scoring performances. Team-mate Schumacher tended not to suffer from these problems as much, partly because he often did not qualify as far up the grid as Trulli. He trailed off towards the end of the 2005 season, ending the year behind Ralf Schumacher.

Mechanical failure was a factor with the Italian&#x27;s 2006 campaign, with the loss of podium finishes occurring all too often. It took Trulli until round 9 to score points, but he did so with 6th place after qualifying 4th. More great results followed, with his run from 22nd to 4th at Indianapolis standing out. However, it was a year with a notable lack of points scored, and did nothing for Trulli&#x27;s reputation, allowing his critics to claw back at him.

The season was the first in which, when paired together at the Japanese team, Trulli outscored Ralf Schumacher overall. While Schumacher left the team, Trulli&#x27;s new team-mate was the reigning GP2 Champion Timo Glock.

Trulli began the 2009 season with a 3rd place at the Australian Grand Prix. Teammate Glock finished 5th but ended up placing 4th due to Lewis Hamilton being disqualified.

<doc id="1105746" wikidata="Q108829178" url="?curid=1105746" title="Well smack">
<text>A well smack was a type of traditional fishing boat in use in the United Kingdom and then the Faroe Islands between the late 18th century and around 1920. It had a well amidships. The well was filled with circulated external water, which kept fish alive until delivered to land and sold. It was a modified form of a fishing smack.

==History==
Between roughly 1775 and 1875, &quot;well smack&quot; referred to a 50-foot gaff cutter used in long-lining for cod, ling, turbot, and other bottom-living sea fish. These vessels were also known as cod boats. From roughly 1875 to 1920, they were extended to make 80-foot gaff ketches, sometimes by the cut-and-shut procedure. Some were built as new 80-foot welled smacks; some were turned into dry ships for use with ice.

==Structure and usage==

These smacks were heavy-hulled with a draught of two fathoms. They were buoyant fore and aft, with the well contained amidships. Augur holes were drilled in the sides of the hull so that water could flow freely for re-oxygenation. Fish placed in the well could then be carried upriver to market (from 1750 especially Billingsgate, London; from 1900 the Faroes) in fresh condition. The swim bladders of the fish had to be pierced to prevent them from floating. Turbot and other flatfish were suspended on thin rope to prevent them from clogging the augur holes. Crews considered these ships safe and stable, according to Faroes crewmen who remembered sailing in them before 1920.

By about 1854, the Thames was too polluted for use of welled smacks, and fishermen had to leave fish in floating cod boxes in the Thames estuary near Ipswich. Many fishermen moved out of Thames fishing ports such as Barking, and went to the east coast, especially to Grimsby and Lowestoft. Some cod boats, including some welled smacks, did continue to fish out of Barking until around 1900. However most continued to carry the Port of London port-registration LO.

Until the 1870s, these smacks travelled from London to Iceland in summer, and returned via North Sea ports, including Holland. From the 1870s, those converted to dry ketches were used in fleeting in the North Sea, especially in the Silver Pits. From 1900 to 1920, the last welled smacks were sold to the Faroe Islands. The last welled smacks sank in the Faroes in about 1920.

==Marine archaeology and research==

There is no way today of seeing or touching a UK welled smack, apart from the drawings, and a fuzzy, distant photo or two, in Edgar J. March&#x27;s 1950 book. There is no known film, photo of the deck, marine wreck site, or souvenir. A welled smack should be easily identifiable at a wreck site from the unusually heavy hull-construction around the well. In the British Film Institute there may be one copy of a Faroese film of sou-westered fishermen on the rolling deck of a welled smack, pricking swim-bladders and placing the fish in the well—but it is not available to researchers for confirmation. In New England, however, the &quot;Emma C. Berry&quot; survives.

<text>Patrick Reginald Chalmers (27 June 1872 – 12 September 1942) was an Irish writer, who worked as a banker. His first book was &quot;Green Days and Blue Days&quot; (1912), followed by &quot;A Peck of Malt&quot; (1915).

He wrote in a number of different areas, including field sports, deerstalking and horse racing, as well biographies of Kenneth Grahame and J. M. Barrie. He was a contributor to &quot;Punch magazine&quot; and &quot;The Field&quot;, and editor of the hunting diaries of Edward VIII (as Prince of Wales). He also wrote much poetry, with topics war, dogs and cats, and Irish life, as well as hunting and fishing. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

Variations on the line &quot;What&#x27;s lost upon the roundabouts we pulls up on the swings!&quot;, appearing in his poem &quot;Roundabouts and Swings&quot;, have entered common parlance, though the origin is often no longer remembered. The phrase appeared six years earlier in the form &quot;What we lose on the swings we make up on the roundabouts&quot; in P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s 1906 novel &quot;Love Among the Chickens&quot;.

<text>The Kenya national football team, colloquially known as the Harambee Stars, represents Kenya in association football. It is controlled by the Football Kenya Federation, the governing body of football in Kenya, and competes as a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA). The team plays its home games primarily at the Nyayo National Stadium in the capital, Nairobi.

==Name==
The team&#x27;s colloquial name, the Harambee Stars, derives from &quot;Harambee,&quot; a Kenyan tradition of community self-help events such as fundraising and development activities. The word means &quot;all pull together&quot; in Swahili, and is the official motto of Kenya, appearing on its coat of arms.

==History==
FIFA suspended Kenya from all football activities for three months in 2004, due to the interference of the government in football activities. The ban was reversed after the country agreed to create new statutes.

On 25 October 2006, Kenya was again suspended from international football, for failing to fulfil a January 2006 agreement made to resolve recurrent problems in its federation. FIFA announced that the suspension would be in force until the federation complied with the agreements previously reached.

Kenya qualified for the 2019 AFCON. The head coach at the time, Sébastien Migné, was appointed in May 2018, and since his appointment Kenya has climbed back into the top 100 FIFA ranked nations.

In May 2017, the Football Kenya Federation signed a 3-year partnership with kits manufacturer Mafro Sports to provide the kits for all national teams, as well as junior categories. The national team would use red jerseys for home matches, white jerseys for away matches, and green jerseys for matches played on neutral venues.

On 8 September 2018, Kenya earned a win over 4-time African champions Ghana, winning 1–0.

On 14 January 2023, Football Kenya Federation stated that it had suspended 14 players, including six players from Zoo Kericho FC and two coaches for match-fixing allegations.

==Results and fixtures==
The following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.


===2024===




==Coaches==
Ray Batchelor was appointed the first national team coach in 1961. However, there was dissent regarding his managerial skills, and a revolt among players during a CECAFA Cup game in Zanzibar led to him being forced out. In 1963, not long after Kenyan independence was declared, Kenyan international Peter Oronge took over coaching duties; however, he disappeared just hours before a Jamhuri Day friendly against reigning champions Ghana in 1965. His absence was never explained, and Batchelor was called in as an emergency replacement. This match was the team&#x27;s worst defeat, with a final score of 13–2 against Ghana. At the time, the Ghanaians were a very strong team with a dangerous striker in the form of Ben Acheampong. Two days later, after Batchelor had reorganised the team, the Kenyans and Ghanaians drew in a friendly match.

<doc id="1105754" wikidata="Q118373" url="?curid=1105754" title="1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision">
<text>On 12 November 1996, Saudia Flight 763, a Boeing 747 en route from Delhi, India, to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907, an Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan, to Delhi, collided over the city of Charkhi Dadri, around west of Delhi. The crash killed all 349 people on board both planes, making it the world&#x27;s deadliest mid-air collision and the deadliest aviation accident ever in India. The final report from the investigation revealed that the Kazakh crew&#x27;s failure to maintain the correct altitude led to the collision. Contributing factors included the poor English language skills in the Kazakh cockpit, resulting in inadequate interpretation of directions provided by air traffic control, and three specific incidents of failures in crew resource management (CRM) by the Kazakh crew. The report also suggested technical enhancements (including ACAS and SSR) that would provide assistance in preventing a future crew&#x27;s mistakes from being allowed to go unchecked in real time. 

==Aircraft involved==

===Saudia Flight 763===

Saudia Flight 763 was a Boeing 747-168B, registration HZ-AIH, departing from Delhi as part of a scheduled international Delhi–Dhahran–Jeddah passenger service with 312 people on board. The crew on this flight consisted of Captain Khalid al-Shubaily (aged 44), First Officer Nazir Khan (aged 37), and Flight Engineer Ahmed Edrees (aged 33). Al-Shubaily was a veteran pilot with 9,837 flying hours.

There is some dispute as to the nationalities of the passengers of Flight 763. According to an article published on 14 November 1996, 215 Indians, many of whom worked in Saudi Arabia as blue-collar workers, boarded the flight, along with 40 Nepalis and three Americans. However, according to a different article, the passenger manifest included 17 people of other nationalities, including nine Nepalis, three Pakistanis, two Americans, one Bangladeshi, one British, and one Saudi Arabian. Twelve of the crew members, including five anti-terrorism officials, were Saudi Arabian citizens.

===Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907===

Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907, an Ilyushin Il-76TD with registration UN-76435, was on a charter service from Chimkent Airport to Delhi. The crew consisted of Captain Alexander Robertovich Cherepanov (aged 44), First Officer Ermek Kozhahmetovich Dzhangirov (aged 37), Flight Engineer Alexander Alexanderovich Chuprov (aged 50), Navigator Zhahanbek Duisenovich Aripbaev (aged 51), and Radio Operator Egor Alekseevich Repp (aged 41). Cherepanov was highly experienced, with 9,229 flight hours.

A company from Kyrgyzstan chartered the flight, and the passenger manifest mostly included ethnic Russian Kyrgyz citizens planning to go shopping in India. Thirteen Kyrgyz traders boarded the flight.

==Accident==
Saudia Flight 763 departed Delhi at 18:32 local time (13:02 UTC). Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 was descending simultaneously to land at Delhi. Both flights were controlled by approach controller V.K. Dutta. Immediately after take-off, the Saudia flight was cleared to an initial altitude of . At 18:34, Dutta cleared the Kazakh plane to descend to when it was from the beacon of the destination airport. Two minutes later, at 18:36, Dutta cleared the Saudia plane, travelling on the same airway but in the opposite direction, to climb to . At 18:38, the SVA crew reported reaching 14,000 feet and requested a higher level. Dutta told them to hold their altitude and standby, to which First Officer Khan replied, &quot;Saudi 763 will maintain one four zero.&quot;

At 18:39, the Kazakh flight reported having reached its assigned altitude of 15,000 feet, but it was actually higher, at , and still descending. At this time, Dutta advised the flight, &quot;Identified traffic 12 O&#x27;Clock, reciprocal, Saudia Boeing 747 at ten miles, likely to cross in another five miles. Report, if in sight.&quot; Radio Operator Repp requested clarification, to which Dutta replied, &quot;Traffic...is at eight miles, level 140.&quot; Repp acknowledged the update, and signed off with, &quot;Now looking 1907.&quot;

Less than a minute later, at 18:40, the crew of a United States Air Force cargo flight made a radio call saying they had seen &quot;a big explosion&quot; at their two o&#x27;clock position. Dutta attempted to contact the Saudia and Kazakh flights but received no response. The two aircraft had collided, with the left wing of the Kazakh flight slicing through the left wing of the Saudia 747 while the left horizontal stabilizer of the 747 sliced off the vertical stabilizer (including the horizontal stabilizer) of the Kazakh flight. The crippled Saudi Boeing immediately lost control and went into a rapidly descending spiral with fire trailing from the wing and broke up mid-air before crashing to the ground at a nearly supersonic speed of . With most of its left wing and vertical stabilizer gone, the Ilyushin went into a flat spin and crashed into a field at a flat attitude near the wreckage of the Saudia plane. All 312 people on board SVA763 and all 37 people on Flight 1907 were killed.

The recorder of the Saudi Arabian plane revealed the pilots said the Islamic Istighfar (forgiveness prayer) and recited the Shahada before impact with the ground.

The collision took place about west of Delhi. The wreckage of the Saudi Arabian aircraft landed near Dhani village, Bhiwani District, Haryana. The wreckage of the Kazakh aircraft hit the ground near Birohar village, Rohtak District, Haryana.

==Investigation and final report==
The crash was investigated by the Lahoti Commission, headed by then-Delhi High Court judge Ramesh Chandra Lahoti. Depositions were taken from the Air Traffic Controllers Guild and the two airlines. The flight data recorders (FDR) were decoded by Kazakhstan Airlines and Saudia under the supervision of air crash investigators in Moscow and Farnborough, England, respectively. The ultimate cause was held to be the failure of Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907&#x27;s pilot to follow ATC instructions, whether due to cloud turbulence or due to communication problems.

The commission determined that the accident had been the fault of the Kazakhstani Il-76 crew, who (according to FDR evidence) had descended from the assigned altitude of and subsequently and even lower. The report ascribed the cause of this serious breach in operating procedure to the lack of English language skills on the part of the Kazakhstan aircraft pilots; they were relying entirely on Radio Operator Repp for communications with the ATC. As part of this, the report suggested that First Officer Dzhangirov (and possibly Captain Cherepanov) might have misunderstood Dutta&#x27;s final radio call, and assumed that the Saudi 747&#x27;s altitude (14,000 feet) was their own assigned altitude. Indian air controllers also complained that the Kazakhstani pilots sometimes confused their calculations because they are accustomed to using metre altitudes and kilometre distances, while most other countries use feet and nautical miles, respectively, for aerial navigation. Although the crew in this particular collision did not appear to have made a computational error, Kazakhstan Airlines did not have enough foot-marked altimeters for all crewmembers. Repp did not have his own flight instrumentation and had to look over the pilots&#x27; shoulders for a reading, which likely limited his own situational awareness. 

Kazakh officials found such a misunderstanding implausible because their records showed Dzhangirov sufficiently fluent to teach English to other Kazakh pilots at the time. Instead, they concludedfrom the Kazakhstani plane&#x27;s misleading flight data recordsthat the aircraft had descended while their pilots were battling turbulence inside a bank of cumulus clouds. Meteorological reports, the affidavits of a Lockheed C-141B Starlifter crew that observed the crash, and conclusive analysis by the investigatorsshowing that the specific flight data record the Kazakh officials focused on proved only that the record was based on faulty recording equipment on the planedisproved the Kazakh theory that turbulence was to blame.

However, whether or not particular crewmembers fully understood the radio transmissions or were distracted by atmospheric conditions, the five-person crew was sufficiently large that it likely struggled to maintain common situational awareness and coordinate crew actions.

Just a few seconds before impact, Repp had realised that the pilots were flying below the required and brought it to their attention. Cherepanov gave orders for full throttle, and the plane climbed, only to hit the oncoming Saudi Arabian plane. The tail of the Kazakhstani plane clipped the left wing of the Saudi Arabian jet, severing both parts from their respective planes.

Furthermore, the investigation noted that Indira Gandhi International Airport did not have secondary surveillance radar, which provides extra information, such as the aircraft&#x27;s identity and altitude, by reading transponder signals; instead, the airport had a primary radar, which produces readings of distance and bearing, but not altitude. In addition, departures and arrivals both shared a single corridor within the civilian airspace around New Delhi. While most areas have separate corridors—one for departures and another one for arrivals—the airspace of Delhi in 1996 had only one civilian corridor for both departures and arrivals because much of the airspace was taken by the Indian Air Force. 

Due to the crash, the air crash investigation report recommended changes to air traffic procedures and infrastructure in New Delhi&#x27;s airspace:

* Separation of inbound and outbound aircraft through the creation of &#x27;air corridors&#x27;
* Installation of a secondary air-traffic control radar for aircraft altitude data
* Mandatory collision avoidance equipment on commercial aircraft operating in Indian airspace
* Reduction of the airspace over New Delhi that was formerly under exclusive control of the Indian Air Force

==Aftermath==
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation subsequently made it mandatory for all aircraft flying in and out of India to be equipped with an airborne collision avoidance system. This set a worldwide precedent for mandatory use of traffic collision avoidance system.

, there is an ongoing effort by the Charkhi Dadri district administration to develop a memorial honoring the victims of the mid-air collision. The proposed memorial, which would consist of names and other information of the victims, would be located at a to-be-built memorial park in the district. However, the district administration is waiting to get an approval for the project from the Haryana government, and plans to include the participation of Ministry of Civil Aviation of India, Airport Authority of India, and embassies of Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan in the development of the memorial.

==Documentaries==
Miditech, a company based in Gurugram, Haryana, produced a documentary about the disaster called &quot;Head On!&quot;, which aired on the National Geographic Channel.

The collision was also the subject of the 2009 episode &quot;Sight Unseen&quot;, of the Canadian-made, internationally distributed documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;.

<text>Seán Feargal Sharkey (born 13 August 1958) is a singer from Northern Ireland. He was the lead vocalist of punk band The Undertones in the 1970s and 1980s and a solo artist in the 1980s and 1990s. His 1985 solo single &quot;A Good Heart&quot; was a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands. After becoming less musically active in the early 1990s, he has performed various roles supporting the UK&#x27;s commercial music industry, winning several awards and honours for his work in that area. 

Sharkey is also a lifelong fly fisherman, has campaigned against the pollution of British rivers (particularly chalk streams), and is the Chairman of the Amwell Magna Fishery. He has become a figurehead for the campaign to prevent water companies dumping sewage into UK waterways and coasts.

==Biography==
===The Undertones (1975–1983)===
Sharkey, who was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, joined The Undertones shortly after their formation in 1975. They had several UK hits, with songs such as &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot;, &quot;Here Comes The Summer&quot;, &quot;My Perfect Cousin&quot;, &quot;Wednesday Week&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Going to Happen!&quot;. The band split in 1983 citing musical differences, with Sharkey pursuing a solo career and other members of the band forming That Petrol Emotion the following year.

===The Assembly (1983)===
Before his solo career took off, Sharkey was also the singer of the one-shot group The Assembly with ex-Yazoo and Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke (pre-Erasure). In 1983, their single &quot;Never Never&quot; was a No. 4 hit in the UK Singles Chart.

===Solo career (1984–1991)===
Sharkey&#x27;s debut single was a collaboration with Madness member Cathal Smyth titled &quot;Listen to Your Father&quot;. The single was released on Madness&#x27;s label Zarjazz Records in 1984, reaching No. 23 in the UK chart. The track was performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with members of Madness.

Sharkey&#x27;s solo work was significantly different to the post-punk offerings of The Undertones. His best-known solo material is the 1985 UK chart-topping single penned by Lone Justice frontwoman Maria McKee, &quot;A Good Heart&quot;, which went to No. 1 in several countries including the UK in late 1985. He also had a UK Top 5 hit in 1986 with &quot;You Little Thief&quot;. His eponymous debut album reached No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart.

Following on from his second album &quot;Wish&quot; in 1988, he achieved further success in 1991 with his UK Top 30 album &quot;Songs From The Mardi Gras&quot;, which produced the No. 12 hit single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got News for You&quot;.

===Music industry (1992–present)===
Starting in the early 1990s Sharkey moved into the business side of the music industry, initially in A&amp;R for Polydor Records, and then as managing director of EXP Ltd. He was appointed a member of the Radio Authority for five years from December 1998 to December 2003.

When the Undertones reunited in 1999, Sharkey was offered the opportunity to rejoin the group but turned down the offer. His position as lead vocalist/frontman for the Undertones was taken by fellow Derry native Paul McLoone.

Sharkey became chairman of the UK Government task force the &#x27;Live Music Forum&#x27; in 2004, to evaluate the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on the performance of live music, and gave public evidence before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 11 November 2008.

In 2008, Sharkey was appointed as the CEO of British Music Rights, replacing Emma Pike. In October 2008, he became head of UK Music, an umbrella organisation representing the collective interests of the UK&#x27;s commercial music industry. He has become prominent in criticising the use of Form 696 by the Metropolitan Police&#x27; requiring event promoters to provide data on performers and audiences. Sharkey resigned from UK Music on 11 November 2011.

In 2011, Sharkey made a one-off appearance in a set named Erasure + Special Guests, singing &quot;Never Never&quot;. He stated that he had not sung live for 20 years and that Vince Clarke was the only person he would have returned for.

Sharkey appeared on BBC Newcastle, interviewed by Simon Logan on the afternoon show on 7 August 2013. He spoke about his career and his decision to retire from the stage: &quot;I&#x27;ve had an absolutely brilliant career... It&#x27;s time to get off the stage and make room for [new artists]&quot;.

===Awards and honours===
In 2004, Sharkey was awarded the &quot;Scott Piering Award&quot;, by the radio industry for &quot;recognising achievement in the promotion of music and the understanding of the music industry to their colleagues in radio&quot;. He is the only member of the Radio Authority to have been honoured in this way by the radio industry.

In 2006, he received the &quot;Bottle Award&quot; at the International Live Music Conference for &quot;outstanding contribution to the live music industry&quot;.

In 2008, Sharkey was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Arts, by the University of Hertfordshire in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of music.

In 2009, he entered &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s MediaGuardian 100, described as the &quot;MediaGuardian&#x27;s annual guide to the most powerful people in television, radio, newspapers, magazines, digital media, media business, advertising, marketing and PR&quot;, at number 56.

In 2010, he appeared in &quot;Wired&quot;&#x27;s The Wired 100, &quot;Who are the people who shape the Wired world,&quot; at number 45. The same year he received a Doctor of Letters honoris causa from the University of Ulster in recognition of his services to music.

Sharkey was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to music.

===Environmental campaigning===
Sharkey is a lifelong fly fisherman and has campaigned against the pollution of British rivers (particularly chalk streams), and the regulations of the water industry which affect British water resources. He gave the keynote address at The Rivers Trust Autumn Conference 2018.

On 30 August 2020, Sharkey appeared in episode 2 of the third series of &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot; to discuss the environmental pressures faced by Britain&#x27;s chalk rivers, during a conversation beside the River Lea. He reappeared on episode 6 of the fifth series of &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot; on 14 October 2022, and discussed pollution in English rivers including the Thames and Wye. He is Chairman of the Amwell Magna Fishery.

He has subsequently become a figurehead for the campaign to prevent water companies dumping untreated sewage into UK waterways and coasts, appearing on television news coverage and gathering a large following on Twitter, as well as supporting &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; campaign to &quot;clean it up&quot;.

===Hobbies===
Sharkey holds the amateur radio callsign G0OAN.

<doc id="1105771" wikidata="Q7044076" url="?curid=1105771" title="No Cure">
<text>No Cure was a fanzine based in Bracknell and Newbury, UK. Originally started by Richard Haworth, from issue 2 it was part-edited and produced by Richard Griffin and Richard H with regular contributions from Jah P. The fanzine took a major interest in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire punk and post punk scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s and covered punk, Oi! post punk and Reggae. Many interviews were conducted by mailing a cassette and list of questions, which elicited interesting discussions between band members without the problem of an interviewer butting in (see also cassette culture). Bands interviewed ranged from The Jam and Stiff Little Fingers to The Raincoats, VIPs, Patrick Fitzgerald, LKJ and The Instant Automatons. The photographer Pennie Smith was also interviewed. A thousand copies of No Cure were sold each issue through record shops in Reading (Quicksilver), Windsor (Revolution) and London including Rough Trade and mail order. At one point it was the largest selling UK zine in New York City.

As with most fanzines, production techniques were rudimentary. Text was produced using a portable typewriter, pens (most issues had a crossword) and images cut from magazines and elsewhere, along with some original photography by Richard H. Text was glued onto boards and sent to the printers. In total seven issues were produced.

Richard G later teamed up with Chris Green producing two issues of Bits fanzine and X Cassettes which released music from local bands like Quality Drivel, as well as groups from further afield. They were also involved in the promotion and distribution of a Reading area compilation LP &quot;Beyond the River&quot; released by Open Door records and featuring local bands such as Dig Dig Dig, El Seven, The Ballistics, The Erection Set, St Vitus Dance, Movita, Shrinking Men, A1 Vegetables, The Beating Hearts, Access and The Stills. A single was released by Oxfordshire band Dig Dig Dig. Richard G was also involved with Mike D of Toxic Graffiti (sic) fanzine in establishing the short lived UK Fanzine Collective. Chris G went on to form Criminal Damage Records.

&quot;No Cure&quot; was the first Berkshire fanzine. It championed local bands such as The Lemon Kittens and the Infra Red Helicopters from Bracknell and the K-9s.

<doc id="1105779" wikidata="Q7729641" url="?curid=1105779" title="Del Rubio triplets">
<text>The Del Rubio Triplets were an American folk/acoustic cover band who rose to fame in the 1980s due mostly to their campy style of dress and their cover versions of songs. They earlier performed from the 1940s through the 1960s as The Boyd Triplets as singers in Xavier Cugat&#x27;s band, in night clubs, and in at least one movie.

==Biography==
The Del Rubio Triplets were born as Edith, Elena, and Mildred Boyd on August 23, 1921, in the Panama Canal Zone. They were of Scottish, English, and Spanish descent, and were also direct descendants of Pocahontas through the Bolling family lineage. Their grandfather was Rolfe Emerson Bolling, and their great aunt was Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, the wife of United States President Woodrow Wilson. The girls grew up in the Panama Canal Zone and Washington, D.C. They had one older sister Lola Boyd, who died in 1992.

Their stage name comes from the color they dyed their hair; the word &quot;rubio&quot; means &quot;blonde&quot; in Spanish. The girls never got married or had children because they didn&#x27;t want to break up their act. They came up with their stage name The Del Rubio Triplets after their mother died from a stroke in 1965. The triplets were Christians.

They first achieved fame in the U.S. in the 1950s, when they were popular night club performers, appearing often on television, including several Bob Hope programs on NBC. They appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

Grammy-winning songwriter Allee Willis is credited with re-discovering the Del Rubio Triplets in 1985 and presenting them at her parties where they garnered much notable attention. Their biggest hits were cover versions of &quot;Whip It&quot; by Devo, &quot;Neutron Dance&quot; by The Pointer Sisters, &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; by The Bangles, &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; by Nancy Sinatra, and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; by The Beatles. They released three albums &quot;Three Gals Three Guitars&quot;, &quot;Whip It&quot;, and &quot;Jingle Bells: Christmas with the Del Rubio Triplets&quot;. In 1999 they released their compilation album &quot;Del Rubio Triplets Anthology&quot; three years after Eadie died.

They made various television appearances such as &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Mother Goose Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Rhyme&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; With Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;New Monkees&quot;, &quot;Videolog with Huell Howser on KCET&quot;, &quot;Square One TV&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; wearing bouffant hairdos and gaudy blue eye shadow. They often appeared scantily clad (usually showing off their legs) despite the fact that they were in their 60s at the time. They often are remembered for their contribution of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; to the Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special that originally aired in 1988. They briefly appeared in the movie &quot;Americathon&quot;, playing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; behind several posing bodybuilders. They also appeared in &quot;Sliders&quot;, season 1 episode 8, &quot;The King Is Back&quot; as themselves, performing &quot;Whip It&quot;. In the late 1980s, they were featured in a McDonald&#x27;s fast food advertisement.

The three performed until Eadie was diagnosed with cancer in 1996; she died that year at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California. After Eadie&#x27;s death, Elena and Milly never performed again, but lived together until Elena died of cancer in 2001. Milly died from pneumonia on July 21, 2011. All three triplets are interred in a family plot at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California next to their father.

<text>Smash Hits was a British music magazine aimed at young adults, originally published by EMAP. It ran from 1978 to 2006, and, after initially appearing monthly, was issued fortnightly during most of that time. The name survived as a brand for a spin-off digital television channel, which was later renamed Box Hits, and website. A digital radio station was also available but closed on 5 August 2013.

== Overview ==

&quot;Smash Hits&quot; featured the lyrics of latest hits and interviews with big names in music. It was initially published monthly, then went fortnightly. The style of the magazine was initially serious, but from the mid-1980s became increasingly irreverent. Its interviewing technique was novel at the time and, rather than looking up to the big names, it often made fun of them, asking strange questions rather than talking about their music.

Created by journalist Nick Logan, the title was launched in 1978 and appeared monthly for its first few issues. He based the idea on a songwords magazine that his sister used to buy, but which was of poor quality. His idea was to launch a glossy-looking magazine which also contained songwords as its mainstay. The publisher was EMAP, a small-time company based in Peterborough, and the magazine was originally titled &quot;Disco Fever&quot;, before they settled on &quot;Smash Hits&quot;.

&quot;Smash Hits&quot; launched the career of many journalists, including &quot;Radio Times&quot; editor Mark Frith. Other well-known writers have included Dave Rimmer, Mark Ellen (who went on to launch &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Word&quot;), Steve Beebee, Chris Heath, Tom Hibbert and Miranda Sawyer. Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys also worked as a writer and assistant editor, and once said that had he not become a pop star, he would likely have pursued his ambition to become editor.

The magazine was also available in continental Europe, especially in Germany, where the issues could be bought at railway stations or airports. The title was licensed for a French version in the 1990s. There were other licensed versions in the magazine&#x27;s history. In 1984, an Australian version was created and proved just as successful for that new market as the original had back in Britain, whilst in the United States, a version was published during the 1980s under the title &quot;Star Hits&quot;, drawing articles from the British version.

It was published by EMAP, who also use the name for one of their digital television services, and for a digital radio station. The brand also covered the annual &quot;Smash Hits Poll Winners Party&quot;, an awards ceremony voted for by readers of the magazine.

The magazine&#x27;s sales peaked during the late 1980s. In the early part of the decade it was regularly selling 500,000 copies per issue, which had risen to over one million by 1989. Sales began to drop during the 1990s and by 1996 it was reported that sales were dropping roughly 100,000 per year. By the time of its demise, it was down to 120,000.

==Final years of publishing==
In the 1990s, the magazine&#x27;s circulation slumped and it was overtaken by the BBC&#x27;s spin-off magazine &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. EMAP&#x27;s other biweekly teen magazine of the period &quot;Big!&quot; (which featured more celebrities and stars of TV series including Australian show &quot;Home and Away&quot; and United States import &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;) was closed and this celebrity focus was shifted over to &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, which became less focused on teen pop and more of an entertainment magazine. The magazine also shifted size a number of times in subsequent relaunches, including one format that was as big as an album with songwords to be clipped out on the card cover. Television presenter and journalist Kate Thornton was editor for a short time.

In February 2006, it was announced that the magazine would cease publication after the February 13 edition due to declining sales.

In July 2009, a one-off commemorative issue of the magazine was published as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson. Further one-off specials were released in November 2009 (Take That), December 2010 (Lady Gaga) and November 2019 (Max Martin), the latter was a free magazine at certain London Underground stations to mark the debut of Martin&#x27;s West End musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;. In April 2022, another free special issue was released to promote the third series of &quot;Derry Girls&quot;.

==Australian edition==
The Australian edition of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine began in November 1984 as a fortnightly. The magazine blended some content from the parent publication with locally-generated material. Australian &quot;Smash Hits&quot; was originally published by Fairfax Magazines and was later purchased by Mason Stewart Publications. Over the years it became a monthly and then a bi-monthly. In 2007 the magazine retailed for A$5.95 Inc. GST and NZ$6.50. On 30 March 2007 it was announced that the Australian edition would cease publication due to low readership. The editor at that time was Emma Bradshaw. The issue that was scheduled to be released on 9 May 2007 was cancelled.

<doc id="1105785" wikidata="Q1420643" url="?curid=1105785" title="Recidivism">
<text>Recidivism (; from &#x27;recurring&#x27;, derived from &#x27;again&#x27; and &#x27;to fall&#x27;) is the act of a person repeating an undesirable behavior after they have experienced negative consequences of that behavior, or have been trained to extinguish it. Recidivism is also used to refer to the percentage of former prisoners who are rearrested for a similar offense.

The term is frequently used in conjunction with criminal behavior and substance abuse. &quot;Recidivism&quot; is a synonym of &quot;relapse&quot;, which is more commonly used in medicine and in the disease model of addiction.

==Causes==
A 2011 study found that harsh prison conditions, including isolation, tended to increase recidivism, though none of these effects were statistically significant. Various researchers have noted that prisoners are stripped of civil rights and are reluctantly absorbed into communities – which further increases their alienation and isolation. Other contributors to recidivism include the difficulties released offenders face in finding jobs, in renting apartments or in getting education. Owners of businesses will often refuse to hire a convicted felon and are at best hesitant, especially when filling any position that entails even minor responsibility or the handling of money (this includes most work), especially to those convicted of thievery, such as larceny, or to drug addicts. Many leasing corporations (those organisations and people who own and rent apartments) routinely perform criminal background checks and disqualify ex-convicts. However, especially in the inner city or in areas with high crime rates, lessors may not always apply their official policies in this regard. When they do, apartments may be rented by someone other than the occupant. People with criminal records report difficulty or inability to find educational opportunities, and are often denied financial aid based on their records. In the United States of America, those found guilty of even a minor misdemeanor (in some states, a citation offense, such as a traffic ticket) or misdemeanour drug offence (e.g. possession of marijuana or heroin) while receiving Federal student aid are disqualified from receiving further aid for a specified period of time.

== Prediction ==
The likelihood of recidivism for a previously convicted criminal can be predicted using structured professional judgement (SPJ) tools in an effort to reduce recidivism by measuring protective factors such as stable work, attitudes towards authority and living circumstances. Two tools used for SPJ include the HCR-20 and the newer SAPROF developed in the late 2010s. SPJ tools are also used in forensic psychiatry.

==Effect of employment==
Most research regarding recidivism indicates that those ex-inmates that obtain employment after release from prison tend to have lower rates of recidivism. In one study, it was found that even if marginal employment, especially for ex-inmates over the age of 26, is offered to ex-inmates, those ex-inmates are less likely to commit crime than their counterparts. Another study found that ex-inmates were less likely to re-offend if they found and maintained stable employment throughout their first year of parole.

African Americans are disproportionately represented in the American prison system, representing approximately half the prison population. Of this population, many enter into the prison system with less than a high school diploma. The lack of education makes ex-inmates qualify for low-skill, low-wage employment. In addition to lack of education, many inmates report a difficulty in finding employment prior to incarceration. If an ex-inmate served a long prison sentence, they have lost an opportunity to gain work experience or network with potential job employers. Because of this, employers and agencies that assist with employment believe that ex-inmates cannot obtain or maintain employment.

For African American ex-inmates, their race is an added barrier to obtaining employment after release. According to one study, African Americans are more likely to re-offend because employment opportunities are not as available in the communities they return to in relation to whites.

==Effect of education==
Education has been shown to reduce recidivism rates. When inmates use educational programs while within incarceration they are roughly 43% less likely to recidivate than those who received no education while incarcerated. Inmates, in regards to partaking in educational programs, can improve cognitive ability, work skills as well as being able to further their education upon release. Maryland, Minnesota and Ohio were involved in a study pertaining to education and recidivism. The study found that when the participant group of released offenders took educational classes while within the confines of prison, they had lower rates of recidivism as well as higher rates of employment. Moreover, the higher the inmates educational level the lower their odds of recidivating becomes. If an inmate attains a certificate of vocation their rate of recidivism reduces by 14.6%, if they attain a GED their rate of recidivism reduces by 25%, or if they attain an Associates in Arts or Associates in Science their rate of recidivism is reduced by 70%. Tax payers are adversely affected as their tax money goes into the prison system instead of other places of society. Educating inmates is also cost effective. When investing in education, it could drastically reduce incarceration costs. For a one dollar investment in educational programs, there would be a reduction of costs of incarceration by nearly five dollars. Education reduces recidivism rates which can reduce cost of incarceration as well as reduce the number of people who commit crime within the community.

==Mental disorders==
Psychopaths may have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions, not only for others, but also for themselves. They do not, for example, deeply recognize the risk of being caught, disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour. However, numerous studies and recent large-scale meta-analysis cast serious doubt on claims made about the ability of psychopathy ratings to predict who will offend or respond to treatment.

In 2002, Carmel stated that the term &quot;recidivism&quot; is often used in the psychiatric and mental health literature to mean &quot;rehospitalization&quot;, which is problematic because the concept of recidivism generally refers to criminal reoffense. Carmel reviewed the medical literature for articles with &quot;recidivism&quot; (vs. terms like &quot;rehospitalization&quot;) in the title and found that articles in the psychiatric literature were more likely to use the term &quot;recidivism&quot; with its criminological connotation than articles in the rest of medicine, which avoided the term. Carmel suggested that &quot;as a means of decreasing stigmatization of psychiatric patients, we should avoid the word &#x27;recidivism&#x27; when what we mean is &#x27;rehospitalization. A 2016 followup by Peirson argued that &quot;public policy makers and leaders should be careful to not misuse the word and unwittingly stigmatize persons with mental illness and substance use disorders&quot;.

== Law and economics ==
The law and economics literature has provided various justifications for the fact that the sanction imposed on an offender depends on whether he was convicted previously. In particular, some authors such as Rubinstein (1980) and Polinsky and Rubinfeld (1991) have argued that a record of prior offenses provides information about the offender&#x27;s characteristics (e.g., a higher-than-average propensity to commit crimes). However, Shavell (2004) has pointed out that making sanctions depend on offense history may be advantageous even when there are no characteristics to be learned about. In particular, Shavell (2004, p. 529) argues that when &quot;detection of a violation implies not only an immediate sanction, but also a higher sanction for a future violation, an individual will be deterred more from committing a violation presently&quot;. Building on Shavell&#x27;s (2004) insights, Müller and Schmitz (2015) show that it may actually be optimal to further amplify the overdeterrence of repeat offenders when exogenous restrictions on penalties for first-time offenders are relaxed.

Also, economists and scholars who research issues related to the IMF use the term recidivism to refer to the behaviour of states who repeatedly engage in IMF economic programs such as SBAs. For example, South Korea, Zaire, Liberia and Panama each spent well over 12 years under consecutive IMF agreements.

==Policies addressing recidivism ==
Countless policies aim to ameliorate recidivism, but many involve a complete overhaul of societal values concerning justice, punishment, and second chances. Other proposals have little impact due to cost and resource issues and other constraints. Plausible approaches include:

# allowing current trends to continue without additional intervention (maintaining the status-quo)
# increasing the presence and quality of pre-release services (within incarceration facilities) that address factors associated with (for example) drug-related criminality—addiction treatment and mental-health counseling and education programs/vocational training
# increasing the presence and quality of community-based organizations that provide post-release/reentry services (in the same areas mentioned in approach 2)
# Prison contemplative programs

The current criminal-justice system focuses on the front end (arrest and incarceration), and largely ignores the tail-end (and preparation for the tail-end), which includes rehabilitation and re-entry into the community. In most correctional facilities, if planning for re-entry takes place at all, it only begins a few weeks or months before the release of an inmate. &quot;This process is often referred to as release planning or transition planning and its parameters may be largely limited to helping a person identify a place to stay upon release and, possibly, a source of income.&quot; A judge in Missouri, David Mason, believes the Transcendental Meditation program is a successful tool for rehabilitation. Mason and four other Missouri state and federal judges have sentenced offenders to learn the Transcendental Meditation program as an anti-recidivism modality.

==By country==

===Norway===

Norway has one of the lowest reimprisonment rates within 2 years in the world at 20% in 2010, 24% in 2014, 23% in 2015, 22% in 2016, 19% in 2017, and 18% in 2018. In Norway the recidivism rate measured by re-charging in the 5-year period from base year 2017 is for any charged offense 38.7%, for property theft 49.6%, for criminal damage 45.2%, for violence and maltreatment 46.8%, for sexual offenses 31.7%, for drug and alcohol offenses 48.1%, and for traffic offenses 27.8%. Prisons in Norway and the Norwegian criminal justice system focus on restorative justice and rehabilitating prisoners rather than punishment.
===United States===
According to an April 2011 report by the Pew Center on the States, 43.3% of prisoners released in 2004 were reincarcerated within 3 years.

According to the National Institute of Justice, almost 44 percent of the recently released return before the end of their first year out. About 68 percent of 405,000 prisoners released in 30 states in 2005 were arrested for a new crime within three years of their release from prison, and 77 percent were arrested within five years, and by year nine that number reaches 83 percent.

Beginning in the 1990s, the US rate of incarceration increased dramatically, filling prisons to capacity in bad conditions for inmates. Crime continues inside many prison walls. Gangs exist on the inside, often with tactical decisions made by imprisoned leaders.

While the US justice system has traditionally focused its efforts at the front end of the system, by locking people up, it has not exerted an equal effort at the tail end of the system: decreasing the likelihood of reoffending among formerly incarcerated persons. This is a significant issue because ninety-five percent of prisoners will be released back into the community at some point.

A cost study performed by the Vera Institute of Justice, a non-profit committed to decarceration in the United States, found that the average per-inmate cost of incarceration among the 40 states surveyed was $31,286 per year.

According to a national study published in 2003 by The Urban Institute, within three years almost 7 out of 10 released males will be rearrested and half will be back in prison. The study says this happens due to personal and situation characteristics, including the individual&#x27;s social environment of peers, family, community, and state-level policies.

There are many other factors in recidivism, such as the individual&#x27;s circumstances before incarceration, events during their incarceration, and the period after they are released from prison, both immediate and long term.

One of the main reasons why they find themselves back in jail is because it is difficult for the individual to fit back in with &#x27;normal&#x27; life. They have to reestablish ties with their family, return to high-risk places and secure formal identification; they often have a poor work history and now have a criminal record to deal with. Many prisoners report being anxious about their release; they are excited about how their life will be different &quot;this time&quot; which does not always end up being the case.

====Drug-related crime====

Of US federal inmates in 2010 about half (51%) were serving time for drug offenses.

It is estimated that three quarters of those returning to prison have a history of substance abuse. Over 70 percent of mentally ill prisoners in the United States also have a substance use disorder. Nevertheless, only 7 to 17 percent of prisoners who meet DSM criteria for a substance use disorder receive treatment.

Persons who are incarcerated or otherwise have compulsory involvement with the criminal justice system show rates of substance abuse and dependence four times higher than those of the general population, yet fewer than 20 percent of federal and state prisoners who meet the pertinent diagnostic criteria receive treatment.

Studies assessing the effectiveness of alcohol/drug treatment have shown that inmates who participate in residential treatment programs while incarcerated have 9 to 18 percent lower recidivism rates and 15 to 35 percent lower drug relapse rates than their counterparts who receive no treatment in prison. Inmates who receive aftercare (treatment continuation upon release) demonstrate an even greater reduction in recidivism rate.

====Recidivism rates====
The United States Department of Justice tracked the re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration of former inmates for 3 years after their release from prisons in 15 states in 1994. Key findings include:

* Released prisoners with the highest rearrest rates were robbers (70.2%), burglars (74.0%), larcenists (74.6%), motor vehicle thieves (78.8%), those in prison for possessing or selling stolen property (77.4%) and those in prison for possessing, using or selling illegal weapons (70.2%).
* Within 3 years, 2.5% of released rapists were arrested for another rape, and 1.2% of those who had served time for homicide were arrested for another homicide. These are the lowest rates of re-arrest for the same category of crime.
* The 272,111 offenders discharged in 1994 had accumulated 4.1 million arrest charges before their most recent imprisonment and another 744,000 charges within 3 years of release.

The Prison Policy Initiative analyzed the recidivism rates associated with various initial offenses and found that statistically, &quot;people convicted of &quot;any&quot; violent offense are less likely to be re-arrested in the years after release than those convicted of property, drug, or public order offenses.&quot;

The ability of former criminals to achieve social mobility appears to narrow as criminal records become electronically stored and accessible.

An accused&#x27;s history of convictions are called antecedents, known colloquially as &quot;previous&quot; or &quot;form&quot; in the UK and &quot;priors&quot; in the United States and Australia.

There are organizations that help with the re-integration of ex-detainees into society by helping them obtain work, teaching them various societal skills, and by providing all-around support.

In an effort to be more fair and to avoid adding to already high imprisonment rates in the US, courts across America have started using quantitative risk assessment software when trying to make decisions about releasing people on bail and sentencing, which are based on their history and other attributes. It analyzed recidivism risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe COMPAS system, and looked at outcomes over two years, and found that only 61% of those deemed high risk actually committed additional crimes during that period and that African-American defendants were far more likely to be given high scores than white defendants.

The TRACER Act is intended to monitor released terrorists to prevent recidivism. Nevertheless, rates of re-offending for political crimes are much less than for non-political crimes.

====African Americans and recidivism====

With regard to the United States incarceration rate, African Americans represent only about 13 percent of the United States population, yet account for approximately half the prison population as well as ex-offenders once released from prison. As compared to whites, African Americans are incarcerated 6.4 times higher for violent offenses, 4.4 times higher for property offenses and 9.4 times higher for drug offenses.

African Americans comprise a majority of the prison reentry population, yet few studies have been aimed at studying recidivism among this population. Recidivism is highest amongst those under the age of 18 who are male and African American, and African Americans have significantly higher levels of recidivism as compared to whites.

The sheer number of ex-inmates exiting prison into the community is significant, however, chances of recidivism are low for those who avoid contact with the law for at least three years after release. The communities ex-inmates are released into play a part in their likelihood to re-offend; release of African American ex-inmates into communities with higher levels of racial inequality (i.e. communities where poverty and joblessness affect members of one ethnicity more so than others) has been shown to be correlated with higher rates of recidivism, possibly due to the ex-inmates being &quot;isolated from employers, health care services, and other institutions that can facilitate a law-abiding reentry into society&quot;.

=====Reducing recidivism among African Americans=====

A cultural re-grounding of African Americans is important to improve self-esteem and help develop a sense of community.
Culturally specific programs and services that focus on characteristics that include the target population values, beliefs, and styles of problem solving may be beneficial in reducing recidivism among African American inmates; programs involving social skills training and social problem solving could also be effective.

For example, research shows that treatment effectiveness should include cognitive-behavioral and social learning techniques of modeling, role playing, reinforcement, extinction, resource provision, concrete verbal suggestions (symbolic modeling, giving reasons, prompting) and cognitive restructuring; the effectiveness of the intervention incorporates a relapse prevention element. Relapse prevention is a cognitive-behavioral approach to self-management that focuses on teaching alternate responses to high-risk situations. Research also shows that restorative justice approaches to rehabilitation and reentry coupled with the therapeutic benefits of working with plants, say through urban agriculture, lead to psychosocial healing and reintegration into one&#x27;s former community.

Several theories suggest that access to low-skill employment among parolees is likely to have favorable outcomes, at least over the short term, by strengthening internal and external social controls that constrain behavior toward legal employment. Any legal employment upon release from prison may help to tip the balance of economic choice toward not needing to engage in criminal activity. Employment as a turning point enhances attachment and commitment to mainstream individuals and pursuits. From that perspective, ex-inmates are constrained from criminal acts because they are more likely to weigh the risk of severing social ties prior to engaging in illegal behavior and opt to refuse to engage in criminal activity.

In 2015, a bipartisan effort, headed by Koch family foundations and the ACLU, reforms to reduce recidivism rates among low-income minority communities were announced with major support across political ideologies. President Obama has praised these efforts who noted the unity will lead to an improved situation of the prison system.

There is greater indication that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration.

==Studies==
There have been hundreds of studies on the relationship between correctional interventions and recidivism. These studies show that a reliance on only supervision and punitive sanctions can actually increase the likelihood of someone reoffending, while well-implemented prison and reentry programs can substantially reduce recidivism. Counties, states, and the federal government will often commission studies on trends in recidivism, in addition to research on the impacts of their programming.

=== Minnesota ===
The Minnesota Department of Corrections did a study on criminals who are in prison to see if rehabilitation during incarceration correlates with recidivism or saved the state money. They used the Minnesota&#x27;s Challenge Incarceration Program (CIP) which consisted of three phases. The first was a six-month institutional phase followed by two aftercare phases, each lasting at least six months, for a total of about eighteen months. The first phase was the &quot;boot camp&quot; phase. Here, inmates had daily schedules sixteen hours long where they participated in activities and showed discipline. Some activities in phase one included physical training, manual labor, skills training, drug therapy, and transition planning. The second and third phases were called &quot;community phases&quot;. In phase two the participants are on intensive supervised release (ISR). ISR includes being in contact with your supervisor on a daily basis, being a full-time employee, keeping curfew, passing random drug and alcohol tests, and doing community service while continuing to participate completely in the program. The final phase is phase three. During this phase one is still on ISR and has to remain in the community while maintaining a full-time job. They have to continue with community service and their participation in the program. Once phase three is complete participants have &quot;graduated&quot; CIP. They are then put on supervision until the end of their sentence. Inmates who drop out or fail to complete the program are sent back to prison to serve the rest of their sentence. Information was gathered through a quasi experimental design. This compared the recidivism rates of the CIP participants with a control group. The findings of the study have shown that the CIP program did not significantly reduce the chances of recidivism. However, CIP did increase the amount of time before rearrest. Moreover, CIP early release graduates lower the costs for the state by millions every year.

=== Kentucky ===
A study was done by Robert Stanz in Jefferson County, Kentucky, which discussed an alternative to jail time. The alternative was &quot;home incarceration&quot; in which the defendant would complete his or her time at home instead of in jail. According to the study: &quot;Results show that the majority of offenders do successfully complete the program, but that a majority are also re-arrested within 5 years of completion.&quot; In doing this, they added to the rate of recidivism. In doing a study on the results of this program, Stanz considered age, race, neighborhood, and several other aspects. Most of the defendants who fell under the recidivism category included those who were younger, those who were sentenced for multiple charges, those accruing fewer technical violations, males, and those of African-American descent. In contrast, a study published by the &quot;African Journal of Criminology and Justice Studies&quot; in 2005 used data from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections to examine 2,810 juvenile offenders who were released in the 1999/2000 fiscal year.
The study built a socio-demographic of the offenders who were returned to the correctional system within a year of release. There was no significant difference between black offenders and white offenders. The study concluded that race does not play an important role in juvenile recidivism. The findings ran counter to conventional beliefs on the subject, which may not have controlled for other variables.

=== Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) ===

A study was conducted regarding the recidivism rate of inmates receiving MMT (Methadone Maintenance Therapy). This therapy is intended to wean heroin users from the drug by administering small doses of methadone, thereby avoiding withdrawal symptoms. 589 inmates who took part in MMT programs between 22 November 2005 and 31 October 2006 were observed after their release. Among these former inmates, &quot;there was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks&quot;.

=== United States, nationwide ===
Male prisoners are exposed and subject to sexual and physical violence in prisons. When these events occur, the victim usually suffers emotionally and physically. Studies suggest that this leads the inmate to accept these types of behaviors and value their lives and the lives of others less when they are released. These dehumanizing acts, combined with learned violent behavior, are implicated in higher recidivism rates. Two studies were done to attempt to provide a &quot;national&quot; recidivism rate for the US. One was done in 1983 which included 108,580 state prisoners from 11 different states. The other study was done in 1994 on 272,111 prisoners from 15 states. Both studies represent two-thirds of the overall prisoners released in their corresponding years. An image developed by Matt Kelley indicates the percent of parolees returning to prison in each state in 2006. According to this image, in 2006, there was more recidivism in the southern states, particularly in the Midwestern region. However, for the majority, the data is spread out throughout the regions.

=== Rikers Island, New York, New York ===
The recidivism rate in the New York City jail system is as high as 65%. The jail at Rikers Island, in New York, is making efforts to reduce this statistic by teaching horticulture to its inmates. It is shown that the inmates that go through this type of rehabilitation have significantly lower rates of recidivism.

=== Arizona and Nevada ===
A study by the University of Nevada, Reno on recidivism rates across the United States showed that, at only 24.6 percent, Arizona has the lowest rate of recidivism among offenders compared to all other US states. Nevada has one of the lowest rates of recidivism among offenders at only 29.2 percent.

=== California ===
The recidivism rate in California as of 2008–2009 is 61%. Recidivism has reduced slightly in California from the years of 2002 to 2009 by 5.2%. However, California still has one of the highest recidivism rates in the nation. This high recidivism rate contributes greatly to the overcrowding of jails and prisons in California.

=== Connecticut ===
A study conducted in Connecticut followed 16,486 prisoners for a three-year period to see how many of them would end up going back to jail. Results from the study found that about 63% of offenders were rearrested for a new crime and sent to prison again within the first three years they were released. Of the 16,486 prisoners, about 56% of them were convicted of a new crime.

=== Florida ===
In 2001, the Florida Department of Corrections created a graph showing the general recidivism rate of all offenders released from prison from July 1993 until six and a half years later. This graph shows that recidivism is much more likely within the first six months after they are released. The longer the offenders stayed out of prison, the less likely they were to return.

<doc id="1105796" wikidata="Q702439" url="?curid=1105796" title="Jan Fabre">
<text>Jan Fabre (born 14 December 1958) is a versatile Belgian artist known for his contributions to theater, literature, and visual arts. With a career spanning nearly four decades, Fabre has established himself as an influential figure in the artistic landscape.

== Consilience artist ==
Jan Fabre often refers to the concept of &quot;consilience&quot; – the unity of knowledge – a concept that was elaborated by William Whewell (1794–1866) and further developed by the American entomologist, biologist and philosopher Edward O. Wilson (1929–2021) in his book 1998 &quot;Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge&quot;.

Fabre describes himself as a consilience artist, explaining: &quot;It’s a merging of elements from different disciplines guided by fact-based theory and practice across disciplines. An understanding of entomology can, for example, lead to new interpretations within the visual arts. Or vice versa – you see connections (For example across art, theatre, science, religion, medicine), you make new interpretations. This is consilience.&quot; Fabre identifies with this idea of consilience, taking a multifaceted and far-reaching approach. Thanks to this undertaking, Fabre offers fresh interpretations to the world of visual art, theatre and literature.

== Visual art ==
In his visual oeuvre, Fabre has developed a unique and coherent universe; a highly personal visual language with recurring symbols and motifs. Whilst studying in Antwerp at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and the Municipal Institute for Decorative Arts and Crafts, where he &quot;developed a profound love of beauty and its spiritual power&quot;. Curious by nature he became influenced by the manuscripts of entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre (1823–1915), he &quot;became fascinated by the world of insects at a young age&quot;.

The iconic artworks featuring the iridescent wing-cases of the jewel beetle are an example of how Fabre wields metamorphosis as one of his driving forces. Thanks to its external skeleton and description in age-old mythologies, the jewel beetle has a long life, both physically and spiritually. The mosaic artworks in which the artist uses the wing shells as a base are also created to endure. Examples include in the ceiling installation ‘Heaven of Delight’ in Brussels’ Royal Palace (2002), in the three permanent altarpieces in AMUZ, the former St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in Antwerp (2018), or the site-specific work ‘Tribute to a free spirit (2020) at the Fondation GGL Helenis, Montpellier.

He wrote his first scripts for theatre between 1976 and 1980 and also did his first solo performances. During his &#x27;money-performances&#x27;, he burned money and wrote the word &#x27;MONEY&#x27; with the ashes. In 1977, he renamed the street where he lived to &quot;Jan Fabre Street&quot; and fixed a commemorative plaque &quot;Here lives and works Jan Fabre&quot; to the house of his parents, analogous to the commemorative plate on the house of Vincent van Gogh in the same street. In 1978 he made drawings with his own blood during the solo performance &#x27;My body, my blood, my landscape&#x27;. From 1980, Fabre began his career as a stage director and stage designer.

Fabre became known for his Bic-art (ballpoint drawings). In 1980, in &#x27;The Bic-Art Room&#x27;, he had himself locked up for three days and three nights in a white cube full of objects, drawing with blue &quot;Bic&quot; ballpoint pens as an alternative to &quot;Big&quot; art. In 1990 he covered an entire building with ballpoint drawings.

Fabre also explored relationships between drawing and sculpture creating sculptures in bronze (among them &quot;The man who measures the clouds&quot; and &quot;Searching for Utopia&quot;) and with beetles. He decorated the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels with one million six hundred thousand jewel-scarab wing cases for his work &quot;Heaven of Delight&quot;. In 2004 he erected &quot;Totem&quot;, a giant bug stuck on a 70-foot steel needle, on the Ladeuzeplein in Leuven (BE).

In September 2016, Fabre made an attempt to &quot;not break&quot; cyclist Eddy Merckx&#x27;s 1972 hour record at the Tête d&#x27;Or Velodrome in Lyon. Fabre completed a total of 23 km in an hour, compared to Merckx&#x27;s record of over 49 km. Merckx, fellow cyclist Raymond Poulidor, and veteran cycling commentator Daniel Mangeas commentated the event, which was performed as the opening of his &quot;Stigmata&quot; retrospective exhibition organised by the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Lyon. Fabre described the attempt as &quot;how to remain a dwarf in the land of giants&quot;.

== Theatre ==
Jan Fabre makes a clean break with the conventions of contemporary theatre by introducing the concept of ‘real-time performance’ and explores radical possibilities as a means of resurrecting theatre and dance. Fabre has been writing his own plays since 1975. The acuteness and reserve with which he employs language demand innovative solutions which have also appeared at the hand of other directors who have worked with his texts.

In 1982, his production titled &quot;This is theatre as was to be expected and foreseen&quot; challenged established conventions within European theater circles, a trend that continued with subsequent works like &quot;The Power of Theatrical Madness&quot; performed at the Venice Biennale in 1984.

In 1986 he established the Troubleyn/Jan Fabre theatre company with extensive international operations; its home base is Antwerp, Belgium.

As a choreographer, Fabre explored innovative approaches to classical dance with pieces such as &quot;The Dance Sections&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Sound of One Hand Clapping&quot; (1990), for the Frankfurt Ballet. These choreographies served as precursors to the operatic trilogy &quot;The Minds of Helena Troubleyn&quot; which he created in collaboration with Polish composer Eugeniusz Knapik.

In 2005 Jan Fabre became artiste associé of the Festival d&#x27;Avignon. There he premièred &quot;Histoire des larmes&quot; at the Cour d’Honneur, a venue where he had previously presented Je suis sang in 2001. In 2007, Jan Fabre created &quot;Requiem für eine Metamorphose&quot; for the Felsenreitschule in Salzburg.

One of Jan Fabre&#x27;s most well-known theatre works came in 2015 with &quot;Mount Olympus – To glorify the cult of tragedy&quot; &quot;(A 24-hour performance)&quot; a marathon production with 27 performers lasting a twenty-four-hour period that thematizes Greek tragedies. In 2023, with &quot;Peak Mytikas (On the top of Mount Olympus),&quot; an 8-hour production, Jan Fabre continues his research on the Greek tragedies, focusing on the house of Thebes, the tragedies of Oedipus and Antigone.

Throughout his career, Fabre has crafted numerous solo productions for key performers of the Troubleyn/Jan Fabre company. These solos are mostly based on his own texts. He made, among other works, for Els Deceukelier; &quot;Elle était et elle est, même&quot; (1991 &amp; 2022) and &quot;Etant donnés&quot; (2004); for Ivana Jozić &quot;Angel of Death&quot; (2003) and &quot;Another Sleepy dusty delta day&quot; (2008); for Annabelle Chambon &quot;Preparatio mortis&quot; (2005 &amp; 2010); for Antony Rizzi &quot;Drugs kept me alive&quot; (2012) and for Cédric Charron &quot;Attends, Attends, Attends… (Pour mon père)&quot;. In 2019 he created &quot;Resurrexit Cassandra&quot; for Stella Höttler and &quot;Simona, the gangster of art&quot; with the Italian actress Irene Urciuoli.

Since 2016, Jan Fabre&#x27;s production &quot;The Night Writer&quot; has been performed in several national theatres in Europe (Italy, Saint Petersburg, Belgrade, Vilnius, Ljubljana and Dubrovnik). &quot;The Night Writer&quot; is always performed by a known actor in their native language. The performance is based on Fabre&#x27;s Night Diaries, that he has been writing since the beginning of his career and his stage texts. &quot;The Night Writer&quot; is the most awarded production from Jan Fabre&#x27;s extensive body of work.

Jan Fabre&#x27;s is included in the prestigious series &quot;The Great European Stage Directors&quot; (Methuen/Drama), supervised by the influential theatre historian Simon Shepherd. The series begins with Stanislavski and ends with Jan Fabre. The other two contemporaries included in the final volume of the eight-volume book series are Pina Bausch and Romeo Castellucci.

== Conviction ==
In September 2018, twenty former members of Fabre&#x27;s performing arts company, Troubleyn/Jan Fabre (Antwerp, Belgium) accused him of sexual harassment, abuse of power, and assault. These accusations strongly diminished Fabre&#x27;s standing in the artistic community.

On 29 April 2022, Jan Fabre was sentenced by a Belgian court to 18 months (without imprisonment) for 5 &quot;violations of the law on the welfare of workers&quot; and, in the case of a woman, of &quot;assault on decency&quot; (i.e. assault for a kiss &#x27;with the tongue&#x27;). While Jan Fabre did not appeal his conviction, 175 former employees and colleagues have sided with the artist/theatre-maker and spoken out about the incorrect portrayal of Fabre. 

== Controversy ==

On 26 October 2012, several media outlets reported on a shoot in the Antwerp town hall for a forthcoming film exploring Jan Fabre&#x27;s artistic practice, living cats were thrown into the air, after which they made a landing on the steps of the entrance hall (which was covered in a protective layer). The owner of the cats and vet was present during the filming. Later that day, Fabre claimed all cats were still in good health.

Then in February 2016, Jan Fabre was appointed by the Greek Ministry of Culture as the Creative Director of the annual Athens – Epidaurus Festival. He resigned less than two months later, on 2 April 2016, after controversy over his plan to turn Greece&#x27;s major arts festival into &quot;a tribute to Belgium&quot; and devote eight of the festival&#x27;s ten productions to those from his homeland.

In October 2016, the Russian State Hermitage museum staged a Fabre exhibition which drew a lot of criticism from visitors and institutions such as the Russian Orthodox Church. Stuffed animals in strange poses sparked outcry among Russian social media network users who launched a campaign under the hashtag #позорэрмитажу, or &quot;Shame on you, Hermitage&quot;. The museum then organized an event to meet the public and explain the exhibition. The artist confirmed that the animals used were taken from roads where they had been killed and denied any accusations by critics of cruelty.

&quot;The animals featured in this installation were found near Antwerp, because many people in Belgium, Holland and France buy dogs and then abandon them on the street during the summer and so they are killed. This installation is essentially a kind of a homage to these animals...I think this exhibition also talks about the power and the force and the vulnerability of humankind and animals.&quot; – Jan Fabre

<text>The Framework for Intervention is a preventive approach to meet concerns about behaviour in schools and nurseries. It concentrates on helping staff to change the school environment, rather than the child. This means that all the factors that might affect the student or child&#x27;s behaviour in the classroom or around the school can be analysed. To change the environment, it offers teachers and other school staff a structure for planning, carrying out and evaluating their ideas. 

Evaluation has shown that changing something in the environment for the better almost always improves the behaviour of the child, and also the behaviour of others in the class.

It was introduced by Birmingham (UK) City Council Education Department in 1997 and now being used across the UK and Ireland. In Norway where it is known as &quot;Fin Stil&quot; (Fine Style), it was due to be extended nationwide from 2009.

<text>Argavieso refers to a Lordship in the kingdom of Aragón, Spain. The lords were originated in the bastard of Ferdinand II of Aragon (with his concubine Aldonça Roig d&#x27;Ivorra Alemany), Alonso de Aragón (Alphonse of Aragó), who was archbishop of Zaragoza born in 1470 and died in 1520.

The title of Lord of Argavieso came from his concubine Ana de Gurrea y de Gurrea, lady of Argavieso. They had a son called Ferran (Hernando de Aragón, born in 1498 and died in 1577) who was the following lord (1520–77).

His son, Pere, was lord of Ballobar and Las Casetas. He had four sons: Joan (deceased 1598), lord of Ballobar and Las Casetas. After 1598, their brother Josep was proclaimed lord of Ballobar, but died without sons, and the successor was his sister, María (the cadet sister Agustine of Gurrea died without leaving behind any descendants). After María&#x27;s death, the direct branch ended.

<text>Honeybus were a 1960s pop group formed in April 1967, in London. They are best known for their 1968 UK top 10 hit single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Maggie Go&quot;, written by group member Pete Dello who also composed their previous single &quot;(Do I Figure) In Your Life&quot;, later recorded by Dave Berry, Ian Matthews, Joe Cocker, Dave Stewart, Paul Carrack, Samantha Jones, Dana, Pierce Turner, and Euros Childs.

==Career==
The band&#x27;s main composers were Dello and Ray Cane although Colin Hare also contributed songs. The group&#x27;s supporters and critics, amongst them Kenny Everett, compared the band to &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;-era Beatles.

Honeybus had a major hit with 1968&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Maggie Go&quot;, which was so popular that it earned the band a cover photo on the popular music magazine &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, for which they posed atop a red London bus. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Maggie Go&quot; reached Number 8 in the UK Singles Chart, in April 1968, staying in the Top 40 for over two months.

Dello resigned in August 1968. The band recruited Jim Kelly on guitar and vocals to replace him and Cane began songwriting and performing lead vocals. This line-up scored minor successes with &quot;She Sold Blackpool Rock&quot; and &quot;Girl Of Independent Means&quot;. Honeybus eventually disbanded late in 1969. Their 1970 album &quot;Story&quot;, without an active band to promote it, failed to chart. However, it is now highly collectable and has sold around £1,000 in mint condition. It has since been re-issued on compact disc.

Dello, Hare and Kelly all went on to record solo material in the early 1970s that was critically acclaimed but failed to achieve significant commercial success.
Pete Dello and Colin Hare both recorded solo albums for “Penny farthing” “Into your ears” and “March Hare” respectively. Featuring members of the Honeybus. ”Into your ears being re-issued years later by Hanky Panky records. “March Hare has enjoyed at least five re-issues in Tokyo, Korea, Spain and UK.
Kelly’s single “Mary Mary”/ “Reverend Richard Bailey” written and produced by Cane was also released around the same time.

The Dello line-up of the band reunited in 1971 to record a new body of songs for the Bell Records label and a complete LP, &quot;Recital&quot;, for the British division of Warner Bros. Records. A change in management at Warner Brothers meant that &quot;Recital&quot; was never issued.
It was, however released finally on vinyl by Hanky Panky &amp; Mapache records in 2018.
Colin Hare accompanied Pete Dello and performed with him at the Felipop music festival in Galicia, Spain in 2002. Such was the response by fans that Hare was inspired to record seven more albums from 2004 up until 2023, all now available on:colinhare.bandcamp.com.

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Let Maggie Go&quot; was also a top 10 hit in Italy, with a version made by Equipe 84, entitled &quot;Un angelo blu&quot; (&quot;A blue angel&quot;). It enjoyed an unexpected return in popularity in the 1970s, when it was used in the iconic TV jingle commercial for &quot;Nimble&quot;, a bread produced for slimmers.

==Disbanding and aftermath==

Kircher left the group in the summer of 1969 and went on tour with Engelbert Humperdinck. He was replaced by drummer Lloyd Courtney for the remainder of the sessions for their debut album. Kircher&#x27;s drumming career saw him joining several bands, among them Compass with Billy Bremner, Roger Rettig and Brian Hodgson, Shanghai, John Scott Cree, Liverpool Express, Original Mirrors and Status Quo. He retired from the music industry after Quo&#x27;s appearance at Live Aid.

Kelly released a solo single in 1969 on Deram entitled &quot;Mary Mary&quot; b/w &quot;Rev. Richard Bailey&quot;, both written by Cane, but it failed to chart. Kelly joined the Sleaz Band in the 1970s and they released &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; on the Fontana label. An album was also recorded, but never released. He died on Boxing Day in 1995 following a long illness.

After a number of years out of the spotlight, Hare, having accompanied Dello in the Galicia music festival recorded new solo material in 2004.
Also, later an EP “Down from Pitswood” featuring two original and long forgotten Honeybus songs, “Incredibly bad” and “Follow the plan” which were first recorded for BBC Radio sessions in the late 1960’s. - In 2007, Hare performed at several venues including Valencia, Barcelona, Bilbao and Madrid with Duncan Maitland and Jon Wigg. -
 The original members of Honeybus were briefly reunited for a Dutch television documentary “Single Luck&quot; in 2003. (Now available on YouTube).

<text>Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche (Masters of the Poster) refers to 256 color lithographic plates used to create an art publication during the Belle Époque in Paris, France. The collection, reproduced from the original works of ninety-seven artists in a smaller 11 x 15 inch format, was put together by Jules Chéret, the father of poster art.

==Publishing history==
The varied selection of prints were sold in packages of four and delivered monthly to subscribers. On sixteen occasions during the selling period between December 1895 through November 1900, the monthly package included a bonus of a specially created lithograph.

A complete set, in five volumes, was sold in 2014 for US$43,450.

<text>Michael Mahonen (born 27 April 1964) is a Canadian actor, director, and screen writer.

==History==

Mahonen has Finnish ancestry. After graduating from the Theatre Arts Program at George Brown College in 1989, he auditioned for a young company formed for the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton. His first job as a professional actor involved the role of James Keller in &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; as well as the roles of Lucius and Popilious Lena in &quot;Julius Caesar.&quot;

In 1990, Mahonen was chosen for the role of Gus Pike for the CBC Television program &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;. He garnered three Gemini Award nominations in 1993, 1994, and 1995 for his work on the television series. In 1992, he starred as a jazz trumpet player with Billy Dee Williams in the film &quot;Giant Steps&quot;. He then played Lee Colgan in the CBC miniseries &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;, directed by Francis Mankiewicz.
In 1994, Mahonen co-starred with Michael Riley in the television special &quot;The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios&quot;. He played the character of Paul, a young man dying of the AIDS virus after contracting it from a blood transfusion a few years earlier. In the summer of 1994, he played the role of Jacob Mercer in &quot;Salt Water Moon&quot;. This was part of David French&#x27;s Mercer family saga set in Newfoundland.

Mahonen also guest-starred in numerous American and Canadian television projects, including an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; entitled &quot;Nemesis&quot;, in which he played a humanoid named &quot;Brone.&quot; In 1997, Mahonen starred in Judith Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Sled&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Tarragon Theatre. He then returned to film, co-starring in the 1998 film &quot;Captured&quot;. He went on to make several more films including &quot;Blindness&quot;.

In 2003, Mahonen began work on his first feature film &quot;Sandstorm&quot;. The film involved a fact-based drama about the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. He wrote, directed, and produced the entire film for under $5,000. The cast was made up of volunteers. The film received 29 awards including Best Feature Film, Best Drama, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.

<text>Zombies are fictional creatures usually portrayed as reanimated corpses or virally infected human beings. They are commonly portrayed as in nature—labeling them as cannibals would imply zombies are still members of the human species, and expert opinions quoted in some of the films below, e.g. Dawn of the Dead, specifically state this is not the case. While zombie films generally fall into the horror genre, some cross over into other genres, such as comedy, science fiction, thriller, or romance. Distinct subgenres have evolved, such as the &quot;zombie comedy&quot; (Zom Com), &quot;romantic comedy with zombies&quot; (Rom Com Zom) and &quot;zombie apocalypse&quot;. Zombies are distinct from ghosts, ghouls, mummies, Frankenstein&#x27;s monsters or vampires, so this list does not include films devoted to these types of undead.

Victor Halperin&#x27;s &quot;White Zombie&quot;, released in 1932, is often cited as the first zombie film.

<doc id="1105823" wikidata="Q1345036" url="?curid=1105823" title="Degaussing">
<text>Degaussing, or deperming, is the process of decreasing or eliminating a remnant magnetic field. It is named after the gauss, a unit of magnetism, which in turn was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. Due to magnetic hysteresis, it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small &quot;known&quot; field referred to as bias. Degaussing was originally applied to reduce ships&#x27; magnetic signatures during World War II. Degaussing is also used to reduce magnetic fields in tape recorders and cathode-ray tube displays, and to destroy data held on magnetic storage.

==Ships&#x27; hulls==


The term was first used by then-Commander Charles F. Goodeve, Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, during World War II while trying to counter the German magnetic naval mines that were wreaking havoc on the British fleet. 

The mines detected the increase in the magnetic field when the steel in a ship concentrated the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field over it. Admiralty scientists, including Goodeve, developed a number of systems to induce a small &quot;N-pole up&quot; field into the ship to offset this effect, meaning that the net field was the same as the background. Since the Germans used the gauss as the unit of the strength of the magnetic field in their mines&#x27; triggers (not yet a standard measure), Goodeve referred to the various processes to counter the mines as &quot;degaussing&quot;. The term became a common word.

The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into the ships, known as &quot;coiling&quot;. In addition to being able to bias the ship continually, coiling also allowed the bias field to be reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the mines were set to detect &quot;N-pole down&quot; fields. British ships, notably cruisers and battleships, were well protected by about 1943.

Installing such special equipment was, however, far too expensive and difficult to service all ships that would need it, so the navy developed an alternative called &quot;wiping&quot;, which Goodeve also devised. In this procedure, a large electrical cable with a pulse of about 2000 amperes flowing through it was dragged upwards on the side of the ship, starting at the waterline. For submarines, the current came from the vessels&#x27; own propulsion batteries. This induced the proper field into the ship in the form of a slight bias. It was originally thought that the pounding of the sea and the ship&#x27;s engines would slowly randomize this field, but in testing, this was found not to be a real problem. A more serious problem was later realized: as a ship travels through Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, it will slowly pick up that field, counteracting the effects of the degaussing. From then on captains were instructed to change direction as often as possible to avoid this problem. Nevertheless, the bias did wear off eventually, and ships had to be degaussed on a schedule. 

Smaller ships continued to use wiping through the war. To aid the Dunkirk evacuation, the British &quot;wiped&quot; 400 ships in four days.

During World War II, the United States Navy commissioned a specialized class of degaussing ships that were capable of performing this function. One of them, USS &quot;Deperm&quot; (ADG-10), was named after the procedure.

After the war, the capabilities of the magnetic fuzes were greatly improved, by detecting not the field itself, but changes in it. This meant a degaussed ship with a magnetic &quot;hot spot&quot; would still set off the mine. Additionally, the precise orientation of the field was also measured, something a simple bias field could not remove, at least not for all points on the ship. A series of ever-increasingly complex coils were introduced to offset these fuze improvements, with modern systems including no fewer than three separate sets of coils to cancel the field in all axes.

===Degaussing range===
The effectiveness of ships&#x27; degaussing was monitored by shore-based &quot;degaussing ranges&quot; (or &quot;degaussing stations, magnetic ranges&quot;) installed beside shipping channels outside ports. The vessel under test passed at a steady speed over loops on the seabed that were monitored from buildings on the shore. The installation was used both to establish the magnetic characteristics of a hull to establish the correct value of degaussing equipment to be installed, or as a &quot;spot check&quot; on vessels to confirm that degaussing equipment was performing correctly. Some stations had active coils that provided magnetic treatment, offering to un-equipped ships some limited protection against future encounters with magnetic mines.

===High-temperature superconductivity===
The US Navy tested, in April 2009, a prototype of its High-Temperature Superconducting Degaussing Coil System, referred to as &quot;HTS Degaussing&quot;. The system works by encircling the vessel with superconducting ceramic cables whose purpose is to neutralize the ship&#x27;s magnetic signature, as in the legacy copper systems. The main advantage of the HTS Degaussing Coil system is greatly reduced weight (sometimes by as much as 80%) and increased efficiency.

A ferrous-metal-hulled ship or submarine, by its very nature, develops a magnetic signature as it travels, due to a magneto-mechanical interaction with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. It also picks up the magnetic orientation of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field where it is built. This signature can be exploited by magnetic mines or facilitate the detection of a submarine by ships or aircraft with magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment. Navies use the deperming procedure, in conjunction with degaussing, as a countermeasure against this.

Specialized deperming facilities, such as the United States Navy&#x27;s Lambert&#x27;s Point Deperming Station at Naval Station Norfolk, or Pacific Fleet Submarine Drive-In Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSF) at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, are used to perform the procedure. During a close-wrap magnetic treatment, heavy-gauge copper cables encircle the hull and superstructure of the vessel, and high electrical currents (up to 4000 amperes) are pulsed through the cables. This has the effect of &quot;resetting&quot; the ship&#x27;s magnetic signature to the ambient level after flashing its hull with electricity. It is also possible to assign a specific signature that is best suited to the particular area of the world in which the ship will operate. In drive-in magnetic silencing facilities, all cables are either hung above, below and on the sides, or concealed within the structural elements of facilities. Deperming is &quot;permanent&quot;. It is only done once unless major repairs or structural modifications are done to the ship.

=== Early experiments ===
With the introduction of iron ships, the adverse effect of the metal hull on steering compasses was noted. It was also observed that lightning strikes had a significant effect on compass deviation, identified in some extreme cases as being caused by the reversal of the ship&#x27;s magnetic signature. In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a patent for a process &quot;to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever&quot;. The technique was described as follows: &quot;For this purpose he employed a number of Grove&#x27;s batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the plates till the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction.&quot; The invention was, however, reported to be &quot;incapable of being carried to a successful issue&quot;, and &quot;quickly died a natural death&quot;.
==Color cathode-ray tubes==

Color CRT displays, the technology underlying many television and computer monitors before the early 2010s, require degaussing. Many CRT displays use a shadow mask (a perforated metal screen) near the front of the tube to ensure that each electron beam hits the corresponding phosphors of the correct color. If this plate becomes magnetized (e.g. if someone sweeps a magnet on the screen or places loudspeakers nearby), it imparts an undesired deflection to the electron beams and the displayed image becomes distorted and discolored.

To minimize this, CRTs have a copper or aluminum coil wrapped around the front of the display, known as the degaussing coil. Monitors without an internal coil can be degaussed using an external handheld version. Internal degaussing coils in CRTs are generally much weaker than external degaussing coils, since a better degaussing coil takes up more space. A degauss circuit induces an oscillating magnetic field with a decreasing amplitude which leaves the shadow mask with a reduced residual magnetization.
Many televisions and monitors automatically degauss their picture tube when switched on, before an image is displayed. The high current surge that takes place during this automatic degauss is the cause of an audible &quot;thunk&quot;, a loud hum or some clicking noises, which can be heard (and felt) when televisions and CRT computer monitors are switched on, due to the capacitors discharging and injecting current into the coil. Visually, this causes the image to shake dramatically for a short period of time. A degauss option is also usually available for manual selection in the operations menu in such appliances.

In most commercial equipment the AC current surge to the degaussing coil is regulated by a simple positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistor device, which initially has a low resistance, allowing a high current, but quickly changes to a high resistance, allowing minimal current, due to self-heating of the thermistor. Such devices are designed for a one-off transition from cold to hot at power up; &quot;experimenting&quot; with the degauss effect by repeatedly switching the device on and off may cause this component to fail. The effect will also be weaker, since the PTC will not have had time to cool off.

==Magnetic data storage media==
Data is stored in the magnetic media, such as hard drives, floppy disks, and magnetic tape, by making very small areas called magnetic domains change their magnetic alignment to be in the direction of an applied magnetic field. This phenomenon occurs in much the same way a compass needle points in the direction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Degaussing, commonly called erasure, leaves the domains in random patterns with no preference to orientation, thereby rendering previous data unrecoverable. There are some domains whose magnetic alignment is not randomized after degaussing. The information these domains represent is commonly called magnetic remanence or remanent magnetization. Proper degaussing will ensure there is insufficient magnetic remanence to reconstruct the data.

Erasure via degaussing may be accomplished in two ways: in AC erasure, the medium is degaussed by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the medium is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by employing a permanent magnet). A &quot;degausser&quot; is a device that can generate a magnetic field for degaussing magnetic storage media. The magnetic field needed for degaussing magnetic data storage media is a powerful one that normal magnets cannot easily achieve and maintain.

=== Irreversible damage to some media types ===
Many forms of generic magnetic storage media can be reused after degaussing, including reel-to-reel audio tape, VHS videocassettes, and floppy disks. These older media types are simply a raw medium which are overwritten with fresh new patterns, created by fixed-alignment read/write heads.

For certain forms of computer data storage, however, such as modern hard disk drives and some tape drives, degaussing renders the magnetic media completely unusable and damages the storage system. This is due to the devices having an infinitely variable read/write head positioning mechanism which relies on special servo control data (e.g. Gray Code) that is meant to be permanently recorded onto the magnetic media. This servo data is written onto the media a single time at the factory using special-purpose servo writing hardware.

The servo patterns are normally never overwritten by the device for any reason and are used to precisely position the read/write heads over data tracks on the media, to compensate for sudden jarring device movements, thermal expansion, or changes in orientation. Degaussing indiscriminately removes not only the stored data but also the servo control data, and without the servo data the device is no longer able to determine where data is to be read or written on the magnetic medium. The servo data must be rewritten to become usable again; with modern hard drives, this is generally not possible without manufacturer-specific and often model-specific service equipment.

==Tape recorders==
In tape recorders such as reel-to-reel and compact cassette audio tape recorders, remnant magnetic fields will over time gather on metal parts such as guide posts tape heads. These are points that come into contact with the magnetic tape. The remnant fields can cause an increase in audible background noise during playback. Cheap, handheld consumer degaussers can significantly reduce this effect.

==Types of degaussers==
Degaussers range in size from small ones used in offices for erasing magnetic data storage devices to industrial-size degaussers for use on piping, ships, submarines, and other large-sized items, equipment to vehicles. Rating and categorizing degaussers depends on the strength of the magnetic field the degausser generates, the method of generating a magnetic field in the degausser, the type of operations the degausser is suitable for, the working rate of the degausser based on whether it is a high volume degausser or a low volume degausser, and mobility of the degausser among others. From these criteria of rating and categorization, there are thus electromagnetic degaussers, permanent magnet degaussers as the main types of degaussers.

===Electromagnetic degaussers===
An electromagnetic degausser passes an electrical charge through a degaussing coil to generate a magnetic field. Sub-types of electromagnetic degaussers are several such as Rotating Coil Degaussers and Pulse Demagnetization Technology degaussers since the technologies used in the degaussers are often developed and patented by respective manufacturing companies such as Verity Systems and Maurer Magnetic among others, so that the degausser is suitable for its intended use. Electromagnetic degaussers generate strong magnetic fields, and have a high rate of work.

====Rotating coil degausser====
Performance of a degaussing machine is the major determinant of the effectiveness of degaussing magnetic data storage media. Effectiveness does not improve when the media passes through the same degaussing magnetic field more than once. Rotating the media by 90 degrees improves effectiveness of degaussing the media.
One magnetic media degaussers’ manufacturer, Verity Systems, has used this principle in a rotating coil technique they developed. Their rotating coil degausser passes the magnetic data storage media being erased through a magnetic field generated using two coils in the degaussing machine with the media on a variable-speed conveyor belt. The two coils generating a magnetic field are rotating; with one coil positioned above the media and the other coil positioned below the media.

====Pulse degaussing====
Pulse degaussing technology involves the cyclic application of electric current for a fraction of a second to the coil being used to generate a magnetic field in the degausser. The process starts with the maximum voltage applied and held for only a fraction of a second to avoid overheating the coil, and then the voltages applied in subsequent seconds are reduced in sequence at varying differences until no current is applied to the coil. Pulse degaussing saves on energy costs, produces high magnetic field strength, is suitable for degaussing large assemblies, and is reliable due to zero-error degaussing achievement.

===Permanent magnet degausser===
Permanent magnet degaussers use magnets made using rare earth materials. They do not require electricity for their operation. Permanent magnet degaussers require adequate shielding of the magnetic field they constantly have to prevent unintended degaussing. The need for shielding usually results in permanent magnet degaussers being bulky. When small-sized, permanent magnet degaussers are suited for use as mobile degaussers.

<doc id="1105824" wikidata="Q3572596" url="?curid=1105824" title="York South (federal electoral district)">
<text>York South was an electoral district (or &quot;riding&quot;) in Ontario, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1904 to 1979.

The riding is notable for the 1942 federal by-election in which newly elected Conservative leader Arthur Meighen was defeated in his attempt to win a seat in the House of Commons by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation&#x27;s (CCF) candidate (assisted by the Liberals). The election was a major breakthrough for the CCF, and ended Meighen&#x27;s attempt to return to politics. In later years, it became known as perennial leaders&#x27; riding, the home district for both CCF and New Democratic Party (NDP) leaders Ted Jolliffe, Donald C. MacDonald, David Lewis and Bob Rae.

==History==
York South was created in 1903 as &quot;the south riding of York&quot; from parts of York East and York West ridings. It initially consisted of the township of York, and the towns of East Toronto, North Toronto, and Toronto Junction. As is suggested by the names of the towns in the riding, the constituency abutted on the city of Toronto&#x27;s northern border.

In 1914, it was called &quot;South York&quot;, and redefined to consist of the villages of Richmond Hill and Markham, the township of Markham, the town of Leaside, and the township of York (excluding parts included in the riding of West York); and those portions of the city of Toronto not included in the ridings of West York, Parkdale, North Toronto, East Toronto, Centre Toronto, West Toronto, South Toronto and East York. In 1924, it was called &quot;York South&quot;, and consisted of all that part of the county of York lying east of Yonge Street, south of the township of Markham and outside the city of Toronto.

In 1933, York South was defined to consist of all that portion of the township of York not included in the electoral district of West York, the town of Weston and the village of Forest Hill. From 1947, it consisted of the village of Forest Hill and a portion of the township of York. In 1952, it consisted the village of Forest Hill and a re-defined portion of the township of York.

As time progressed and the population grew, the riding shrank in size so that it consisted of what was later called the Borough of York in the middle western part of Metropolitan Toronto and some surrounding areas. While it was originally a largely rural riding it was an urban, working class riding by the end of World War II.

The electoral district was abolished in 1976 when the main part of the riding became York South—Weston, and other parts were redistributed between Davenport, Eglinton—Lawrence and St. Paul&#x27;s ridings.

<doc id="1105826" wikidata="Q5956316" url="?curid=1105826" title="Kirby calculus">
<text>In mathematics, the Kirby calculus in geometric topology, named after Robion Kirby, is a method for modifying framed links in the 3-sphere using a finite set of moves, the Kirby moves. Using four-dimensional Cerf theory, he proved that if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are 3-manifolds, resulting from Dehn surgery on framed links &quot;L&quot; and &quot;J&quot; respectively, then they are homeomorphic if and only if &quot;L&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are related by a sequence of Kirby moves. According to the Lickorish–Wallace theorem any closed orientable 3-manifold is obtained by such surgery on some link in the 3-sphere.

Some ambiguity exists in the literature on the precise use of the term &quot;Kirby moves&quot;. Different presentations of &quot;Kirby calculus&quot; have a different set of moves and these are sometimes called Kirby moves. Kirby&#x27;s original formulation involved two kinds of move, the &quot;blow-up&quot; and the &quot;handle slide&quot;; Roger Fenn and Colin Rourke exhibited an equivalent construction in terms of a single move, the Fenn–Rourke move, that appears in many expositions and extensions of the Kirby calculus. Dale Rolfsen&#x27;s book, &quot;Knots and Links&quot;, from which many topologists have learned the Kirby calculus, describes a set of two moves: 1) delete or add a component with surgery coefficient infinity 2) twist along an unknotted component and modify surgery coefficients appropriately (this is called the Rolfsen twist). This allows an extension of the Kirby calculus to rational surgeries.

There are also various tricks to modify surgery diagrams. One such useful move is the slam-dunk.

An extended set of diagrams and moves are used for describing 4-manifolds. A framed link in the 3-sphere encodes instructions for attaching 2-handles to the 4-ball. (The 3-dimensional boundary of this manifold is the 3-manifold interpretation of the link diagram mentioned above.) 1-handles are denoted by either 

The dot indicates that a neighborhood of a standard 2-disk with boundary the dotted circle is to be excised from the interior of the 4-ball. Excising this 2-handle is equivalent to adding a 1-handle; 3-handles and 4-handles are usually not indicated in the diagram.

==Handle decomposition==
* A closed, smooth 4-manifold is usually described by a handle decomposition.
* A 0-handle is just a ball, and the attaching map is disjoint union.
* A 1-handle is attached along two disjoint 3-balls.
* A 2-handle is attached along a solid torus; since this solid torus is embedded in a 3-manifold, there is a relation between handle decompositions on 4-manifolds, and knot theory in 3-manifolds.
* A pair of handles with index differing by 1, whose cores link each other in a sufficiently simple way can be cancelled without changing the underlying manifold. Similarly, such a cancelling pair can be created.

Two different smooth handlebody decompositions of a smooth 4-manifold are related by a finite sequence of isotopies of the attaching maps, and the creation/cancellation of handle pairs.

<text>Samsu-ditāna, inscribed phonetically in cuneiform &quot;sa-am-su-di-ta-na&quot; in the seals of his servants, the 11th and last king of the Amorite or First Dynasty of Babylon, reigned for 31 years, 1625 – 1595 BC (Middle Chronology), 1617-1587 BC (Low Middle Chronology), or 1562 – 1531 BC (Short Chronology). His reign is best known for its demise with the sudden fall of Babylon at the hands of the Hittites.

==History==
He was the great great grandson of Hammurabi and, although the Babylonian kingdom had shrunk considerably since its peak under this illustrious ancestor, it still extended north from Babylon and the Euphrates to Mari and Terqa. For the most part, he appears to have been non-belligerent and content to stay at home at the seat of his kingdom as none of his year names describe the waging of war or the building of monumental edifices. They are about pious gifts to the gods and the erection of statues dedicated to himself. None of his inscriptions have survived. A royal epic of Gulkišar, the 6th king of the 2nd Dynasty of Babylon, the Sealand Dynasty, describes his enmity against Samsu-ditāna.

=== Fall of Babylon ===
Samsu-ditāna apparently feared an attack as evidenced in extant &quot;tamitu&quot; texts, oracle questions addressed to the gods Šamaš and Adad, which name seven “rebel” enemies. However, he was powerless to prevent it, as the Babylonian state was in decay, with offices becoming hereditary, usurping royal prerogative, and payments accepted in lieu of military service to fund the bloated bureaucracy. The eventual coup-de-grace came from an unexpected quarter and his reign was brought to an abrupt end by a raid by the Hittite king, Muršili I in 1595 BC (Middle Chronology), 1531 BC (Short Chronology), which resulted in the sacking and complete devastation of Babylon. The Chronicle of Early Kings tersely reported: “At the time of Samsu-ditāna, the Hittites marched against Akkad.” Muršili conquered just to seize loot and captives, without attempting any lasting occupation, a strategy he had previously employed in his opportunistic putsch against Halpa (ancient Aleppo). The Hittite account appears in the Edict of Telepinu, which relates: “Subsequently he marched to Babylon and he destroyed Babylon, and defeated the Hurrian troops, and brought captives and possessions of Babylon to Hattusa.”

He seized the statues of the Babylonian tutelary deity Marduk and his consort Sarpatinum and transported them to Ḫani where they would not be recovered until the reign of the Kassite king Agum-Kakrime some 24 years later. Babylon was left in ruins and was not reoccupied until the advent of the Kassite dynasty, where documents from Tell Muhammad are dated by the number of years after it was resettled for the reign of Šipta&#x27;ulzi.

<text>Samarium(II) iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula SmI2. When employed as a solution for organic synthesis, it is known as [[Henri B. Kagan|Kagan]]&#x27;s reagent. SmI2 is a green solid and forms a dark blue solution in THF. It is a strong one-electron reducing agent that is used in organic synthesis.

==Structure==
In solid samarium(II) iodide, the metal centers are seven-coordinate with a face-capped octahedral geometry.
In its ether adducts, samarium remains heptacoordinate with five ether and two terminal iodide ligands.

==Preparation==
Samarium iodide is easily prepared in nearly quantitative yields from samarium metal and either diiodomethane or 1,2-diiodoethane. When prepared in this way, its solutions is most often used without purification of the inorganic reagent.
{{NumBlk|:|formula_1|}}

Solid, solvent-free SmI2 forms by high temperature decomposition of samarium(III) iodide (SmI3).

== Reactions ==
Samarium(II) iodide is a powerful reducing agent – for example it rapidly reduces water to hydrogen. It is available commercially as a dark blue 0.1 M solution in THF. Although used typically in superstoichiometric amounts, catalytic applications have been described.

===Organic chemistry===
{{Main|Reductions with samarium(II) iodide}}
Samarium(II) iodide is a reagent for carbon-carbon bond formation, for example in a Barbier reaction (similar to the Grignard reaction) between a ketone and an alkyl iodide to form a tertiary alcohol:

:R1I + R2COR3 → R1R2C(OH)R3
Typical reaction conditions use SmI2 in THF in the presence of catalytic NiI2.

Esters react similarly (adding two R groups), but aldehydes give by-products. The reaction is convenient in that it is often very rapid (5 minutes or less in the cold). Although samarium(II) iodide is considered a powerful single-electron reducing agent, it does display remarkable chemoselectivity among functional groups. For example, sulfones and sulfoxides can be reduced to the corresponding sulfide in the presence of a variety of carbonyl-containing functionalities (such as esters, ketones, amides, aldehydes, etc.). This is presumably due to the considerably slower reaction with carbonyls as compared to sulfones and sulfoxides. Furthermore, hydrodehalogenation of halogenated hydrocarbons to the corresponding hydrocarbon compound can be achieved using samarium(II) iodide. Also, it can be monitored by the color change that occurs as the dark blue color of SmI2 in THF discharges to a light yellow once the reaction has occurred. The picture shows the dark colour disappearing immediately upon contact with the Barbier reaction mixture.

Work-up is with dilute hydrochloric acid, and the samarium is removed as aqueous Sm3+.

Carbonyl compounds can also be coupled with simple alkenes to form five, six or eight membered rings.

Tosyl groups can be removed from &quot;N&quot;-tosylamides almost instantaneously, using SmI2 in conjunction with distilled water and an amine base. The reaction is even effective for deprotection of sensitive substrates such as aziridines:

In the Markó-Lam deoxygenation, an alcohol could be almost instantaneously deoxygenated by reducing their toluate ester in presence of SmI2.

SmI2 can also be used in the transannulation of bicyclic molecules. An example is the SmI2 induced ketone - alkene cyclization of 5-methylenecyclooctanone which proceeds through a ketyl intermediate:
:

The applications of SmI2 have been reviewed. The book &quot;Organic Synthesis Using Samarium Diiodide&quot;, published in 2009, gives a detailed overview of reactions mediated by SmI2.

<text>In Shia Islam, Arba&#x27;in () marks forty days after Ashura, which is the martyrdom anniversary of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the third Shia imam. Husayn was killed, alongside most of his relatives and his small retinue, in the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram 61 AH (680 CE) against the army of the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (). The battle followed Husayn&#x27;s refusal to pledge his allegiance to Yazid, who is often portrayed by Muslim historians as impious and immoral. In Shia Islam, Karbala symbolizes the eternal struggle between good and evil, the pinnacle of self-sacrifice, and the ultimate sabotage of Muhammad&#x27;s prophetic mission. 

Arba&#x27;in coincides with the twentieth of Safar, the second month of the Islamic calendar, and its commemoration is rooted in early Islamic funerary traditions. Shia Muslims annually observe the day through mourning gatherings, dramatic reenactments of Karbala narratives, and charitable acts. Arba&#x27;in is also a day of pilgrimage to the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, Iraq. Pilgrims arrive there in large numbers, often on foot, and many from the city of Najaf, some eighty kilometers away, home to the shrine of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first Shia imam. The Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage, banned under the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, has grown after his deposal in 2003 from two million participants in that year to around twenty million in 2014. As with Ashura, Arba&#x27;in can be an occasion for violence against Shia Muslims.

==Significance in Shia Islam==

In the Islamic calendar, twentieth of Safar, known as Arba&#x27;in, marks forty days after Ashura, tenth of Muharram. In turn, Ashura is the death anniversary of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the third Shia imam. Husayn, alongside most of his male relatives and his small retinue, were killed on 10 Muharram 61 AH (10 October 680 CE) in the Battle of Karbala against the army of the Umayyad caliph Yazid ibn Mu&#x27;awiya (), having been surrounded for some days and deprived of the drinking water of the nearby Euphrates river. After the battle, the women and children in Husayn&#x27;s camp were taken prisoner and marched to the Umayyad capital Damascus in Syria. The battle followed failed negotiations and Husayn&#x27;s refusal to pledge his allegiance to Yazid, who is often portrayed by Muslim historians as impious and immoral. The fight took place in the desert land of Karbala, en route to the nearby Kufa, whose residents had invited Husayn to lead them against Yazid.

In Shia Islam, Karbala symbolizes the eternal struggle between good and evil, the pinnacle of self-sacrifice, and the ultimate sabotage of Muhammad&#x27;s prophetic mission. Historically, the event served to crystallize the Shia community into a distinct sect and remains an integral part of their religious identity to date. Ashura to Arba&#x27;in is thus a period of mourning for Shia Muslims, particularly the first ten days of Muharram and Arba&#x27;in. On the one hand, Shia mourners hope to share in the pain of Husayn to benefit from his intercession on the Day of Judgement. On the other hand, the Shia view mourning for Husayn as an act of protest against oppression, and as such a struggle for God ().

== Arba&#x27;in in Shia tradition ==

Forty is a sacred number in Islam, and commemorating the dead forty days after their death is a long-standing Islamic tradition, dating back to the early Islamic period. On the one hand, the fortieth (, ) signifies the maturation of the soul of a deceased believer. It is thus said that Cain learned on the fortieth of Abel to dispose of his body by burying him, that the ascension of Jesus took place on his fortieth, and that the gates of heaven open for a righteous person forty days after their death. On the other hand, the fortieth marks the end of the period of grief in Islamic tradition. It is thus said that Heaven grieves the death of a righteous person for forty days, that Fatima mourned for forty days the death of her father, the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and that son wept for forty days for John the Baptist, whose head was cut off and placed on a dish.

In Shia Islam, similar traditions are linked to Arba&#x27;in, the fortieth of Husayn. Thus the earth and skies are said to have wept for Husayn for forty days after his death, and the sun became unusually red in that period at dawn and dusk. By some accounts, the body of Husayn, who was decapitated, was reunited with his head and buried in Karbala on Arba&#x27;in. Yet it is commonly thought that Husayn and his companions were buried by residents of nearby al-Ghadiriyya village when the Umayyad army left Karbala. Probably by combining the accounts available to him, the Shia scholar Ibn Tawus () reports another Karbala narrative, according to which Husayn&#x27;s relatives chose to return via Karbala to their hometown of Medina when they were freed from captivity in Damascus. Upon arrival in Karbala on Arba&#x27;in, they met Jabir ibn Abd Allah (), a companion of Muhammad, who had learned about the death of Husayn through a divine sign. This story was repeated by many authors after Ibn Tawus, even though several scholars before Ibn Tawus report only the Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage of Jabir. The veracity of Ibn Tawus&#x27; account has therefore been questioned by some, including the Shia scholar Husain Noori Tabarsi () and the Islamicist Mahmoud M. Ayoub (). Ayoub adds that Arba&#x27;in is not mentioned in , an early and authoritative hadith collection by the Shia traditionist Ibn Qulawayh (). Whatever the case, such narratives may have helped establish Arba&#x27;in in Shia culture. 

Risking the Umayyads&#x27; wrath, commemoration of Karbala was initially small and private. In particular, pilgrimage to Karbala remained limited and precarious in this period. Soon after the Umayyads fell, however, Shia imams worked to institutionalize the Ashura and Arba&#x27;in pilgrimages to the tomb of Husayn. This attempt is reflected in some of the traditions ascribed to the imams. For instance, the Shia imam Hasan al-Askari () is reported to have listed the Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage among the five signs of a true believer. 

==Arba&#x27;in rituals==
Arba&#x27;in is a day of pilgrimage to the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, Iraq. Pilgrims arrive there in large numbers, often on foot. The most popular route is Najaf to Karbala, as many pilgrims first travel to Najaf and then walk from there to Karbala, some eighty kilometers away, which usually takes three days on foot. Along the way, volunteers provide the pilgrims with free meals and services. Indeed, some have considered generosity and hospitality to be the main features of the Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage. When they finally reach the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, pilgrims recite the of Arba&#x27;in, a supplication for this occasion. As with other Shia rituals of Karbala, the Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage was banned by the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (), who favored the Sunni community there, and viewed large Shia rituals as a political threat. The pilgrimage was revived soon after the deposal of Saddam in 2003, with numbers growing from two million participants in that year to around twenty million in 2014. Arba&#x27;in is also commemorated through mourning gatherings, dramatic reenactments of Karbala narratives, and charitable acts. As with Ashura, Arba&#x27;in can be an occasion for Sunni violence against Shia Muslims.

<doc id="1105849" wikidata="Q703006" url="?curid=1105849" title="Home front">
<text>Home front is an English language term with analogues in other languages. It is commonly used to describe the full participation of the British public in World War I who suffered Zeppelin raids and endured food rations as part of what came to be called the &quot;Home Front&quot;.

Civilians are traditionally uninvolved in combat, except when the hostilities happen to reach their residential areas. However, the expanded destructive capabilities of modern warfare posed an increased direct threat to civilian populations. With the rapid increase of military technology, the term &quot;military effort&quot; has changed to include the &quot;home front&quot; as a reflection of both a civilian &quot;sector&quot; capacity to produce arms, as well as the structural or policy changes which deal with its vulnerability to direct attack.

This continuity of &quot;military effort&quot; from fighting combat troops to manufacturing facilities has profound effects for the concept of &quot;total war&quot;. By this logic, if factories and workers producing material are part of the war effort, they become legitimate targets for attack, rather than protected non-combatants. Hence, in practice, both sides in a conflict attack civilians and civilian infrastructure, with the understanding that they are legitimate and lawful targets in war. This military view of civilian targets has effects on the equity of applied legal principles on which the prosecution of crimes against humanity are based.

The concept of civilians&#x27; involvement in war also developed in connection with general development and change of the ideological attitude to the state. In feudal society and also in absolute monarchy the state was perceived as essentially belonging to the monarch and the aristocracy, ruling over a mass of passive commoners; wars were perceived as a contest between rival rulers, conducted &quot;above the head&quot; of the commoners, who were expected to submit to the victor. However even given this, in feudal societies the income of estates and nations, and therefore the wealth and power of monarchs and aristocrats, was proportional to the number of commoners available to work the land. By killing, terrorizing, destroying property and driving away a nobleman&#x27;s serfs, a tactic known as chevauchée, an attacker could hope either to diminish the strength of an opponent or to force an opponent to give battle.

In contrast, since the French Revolution, the state was increasingly perceived as belonging to &quot;the People&quot;, a perception shared—though in different forms—by democracy, communism and fascism. A logical conclusion was that war has become everybody&#x27;s business and that also those not taken into the military must still &quot;do their part&quot; and &quot;fight on the home front&quot;.

==History==

The importance of civilian manufacturing and support services in a nation&#x27;s capacity to fight a war first became apparent during the twenty-five years of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars when the United Kingdom was able to finance and, to a lesser extent, arm and supply the various coalitions which opposed France. Although Britain had a much smaller population than France, its global maritime trade and its early industrialisation meant that its economy was much larger than that of France, which allowed Britain to offset the French manpower advantage.

During the American Civil War, the capacity of Northern factories and agriculture proved as decisive in winning the war as the skills of the generals of either side.

===World War I===

During World War I, the British Shell Crisis of 1915 and the appointment of David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. The United States home front during World War I saw the first ring World War II.

===World War II===

A factor in Allied victory in World War II was the ability of Allied nations to successfully and efficiently mobilize their civilian industries and domestic populations in order to turn out weapons and goods necessary for waging war. By contrast, mobilization of economic resources in Nazi Germany was so inefficient that some early historians of the German economy concluded that the Nazi leadership must have had an intentional policy of favoring civilian over military production until late in the war. The British, by contrast, had already accomplished mobilization for total war by 1940, thereby increasing the output of weapons—especially heavy bombers—vastly. This view was for example presented quite early by John Kenneth Galbraith in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1945 &quot;The simple fact is that Germany should have never lost the war ...&quot;. According to Adam Tooze this view was influenced by the post-war reports from Albert Speer and SS &quot;Wirtschaftsführer&quot; (economy leader) , which were not free from own interests. Tooze&#x27;s alternative view is that Germany was extremely mobilising - already in 1939 there was a higher degree of mobilisation of women in Germany, for example, than Britain ever achieved during the whole war -, but the economy of Germany was simply not strong enough in comparison to the economies of the war opponents, especially with respect to the ever growing support coming from the USA. Slave labour and foreign labour in addition to women&#x27;s labour could not change this. Hitler was early aware of this German weakness. He hoped, however, by a series of Blitzkriegs to change the situation early enough in favour of Germany. This failed due to military defeats in Russia and the ongoing support provided by the US to Britain.

During the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Soviet soldiers and civilians moved their industries out of reach of the advancing Germans (sometimes disassembling and reassembling entire factories) and began turning out vast numbers of T-34 tanks, Il-2 attack aircraft, and other weapons.

<doc id="1105850" wikidata="Q447340" url="?curid=1105850" title="Henrik Zetterberg">
<text>Henrik Zetterberg (; born 9 October 1980) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey forward. He played his entire National Hockey League career, from 2002 to 2018, with the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League.

Bursting onto the scene as a rookie in the 2002–03 NHL season, Zetterberg would finish 2nd overall in votes for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s top rookie. Along with winning the Stanley Cup in 2008, Zetterberg won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs. He won gold medals in the 2006 Ice Hockey World Championships and 2006 Winter Olympics, as part of the first team to ever win both tournaments in the same year, also making him a member of the Triple Gold Club.

==Playing career==

===Timrå IK===
Zetterberg started his youth league career playing games for the Njurunda Sports Club, as did Fredrik Modin. In 2008, the club renamed their arena—until then known as Njurunda Ishall—to Modin &amp; Zetterberg Hall in their honor. When Zetterberg was 15 years old he left Njurunda for Timrå IK. 

Zetterberg caught the attention of the Red Wings&#x27; Assistant General Manager Jim Nill and Director of European Scouting Håkan Andersson during a tournament in Finland. While Andersson was trying to point out Mattias Weinhandl, Nill could not help noticing &quot;this little Zetterberg guy who always seemed to have the puck.&quot;

Zetterberg was selected by the Detroit Red Wings 210th overall in the seventh round of the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Detroit was under criticism at the time for &quot;mortgaging its future&quot;, trading away many of its earlier picks in the 1999 Draft. After playing for Timrå IK of the Swedish Elitserien for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons, Zetterberg signed his entry-level contract on 16 May 2002. Zetterberg came to Detroit to play his rookie season in the NHL in the 2002–03 season.

===Detroit Red Wings===

====Early career (2002–2006)====
Zetterberg made his NHL debut against the San Jose Sharks on 10 October 2002, at the Joe Louis Arena. He played in 79 games his rookie season, scoring 22 goals and 22 assists for 44 points, leading all first-year players. Zetterberg finished the season as runner-up for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year behind St. Louis Blues defenceman Barret Jackman. In his second season, Zetterberg nearly matched his rookie stats despite missing 21 games due to a broken leg suffered against the Vancouver Canucks early in the season on 5 November 2003. Due to the owners&#x27; lockout the next season, Zetterberg returned to Sweden to play for Timrå IK in 2004–05, leading the Elitserien in scoring with 50 points in 50 games.

As the NHL resumed in 2005–06, Zetterberg emerged as an NHL star and was also named an alternate captain in the absence of team captain Steve Yzerman. He enjoyed his second best statistical season in 2005–06, tallying 39 goals and 85 points, second in team-scoring to Pavel Datsyuk in a lineup which included Zetterberg and teammates Tomas Holmström, Mikael Samuelsson, Nicklas Lidström, and Niklas Kronwall. The combination was dubbed the &quot;Swedish Five&quot;, a concept similar to the famed Russian Five of the Red Wings during the 1990s. All five players would also skate together at the 2006 Winter Olympics, helping Sweden to a gold medal.

====Back-to-back Stanley Cup Finals, Stanley Cup win, playoff MVP (2006–2012)====
With the announced retirement of Steve Yzerman during the season, Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; speculated that Zetterberg might take over the captaincy for the Red Wings, but Lidström was instead named Yzerman&#x27;s successor while Zetterberg was named an alternate on the day of the Red Wings&#x27; 2006–07 season opener. That season, Zetterberg was selected for the 2007 NHL All-Star Game, but withdrew to rest an injured wrist. Later in the year, Zetterberg scored his 100th career goal against the Phoenix Coyotes on 8 February 2007, prompting Coyotes head coach Wayne Gretzky to comment that Zetterberg is &quot;probably the most underrated player in the league.&quot; Nine days later, on 17 February, in another game against the Coyotes, Zetterberg picked up his first career hat-trick, all power play goals, and added an assist on an empty-net goal by Jason Williams for a four-point game. He finished the season with 68 points in his injury-shortened 63-game season.
Zetterberg began the 2007–08 season with a 16-game point-scoring streak, breaking the record of 14 games set by former Red Wing Norm Ullman in 1960. He was voted to start for the Western Conference in the 2008 NHL All-Star Game alongside teammates Chris Osgood, Lidström, and Pavel Datsyuk, but again did not play in the game due to back problems. Despite missing time due to injury, Zetterberg recorded a career-year with personal bests of 43 goals, 49 assists and 92 points in 75 games. He went on to add another 27 points in 22 playoff games, leading the Red Wings to the 2008 Stanley Cup championship, their 11th in team history. In game six of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Zetterberg scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. His 13 playoff goals tied with teammate Johan Franzén for the Red Wings record for most in a single postseason. At the end of the season, Zetterberg was also up for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward, but finished as a runner-up to Datsyuk.

In the final year of his contract in 2008–09, Zetterberg agreed to a 12-year, $73 million contract extension with the Red Wings on 28 January 2009. The deal is the longest and most lucrative in franchise history. Zetterberg recorded 11 goals and 13 assists for the Red Wings during the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs that saw them reach Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to their 2008 opponent the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Despite a slow start to the 2009–10 NHL Season, Zetterberg&#x27;s play quickly improved, and he recorded the fourth hat trick of his career on 14 November against the Anaheim Ducks, scoring three goals in the third period of Detroit&#x27;s 7–4 victory. He scored seven goals during the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, which saw Detroit bow out in the conference semifinals against San Jose.
Zetterberg posted 80 points in 80 games in the 2010–11 NHL season. However, the Red Wings were again eliminated by San Jose in the conference semifinals.

In the 2011–12 NHL season, Zetterberg played on the 2nd line alongside Valtteri Filppula and Jiří Hudler. Both teammates had career seasons playing on the line centered by Zetterberg. Filppula scored a career high 66 points while Hudler had a 50-point season (25 goals, 25 assists). The Red Wings fell 4–1 to the Nashville Predators in the conference quarterfinals, their earliest playoff exit since 2006.

====Final years and captaincy (2012–2018)====
Zetterberg signed with EV Zug in Switzerland during the 2012–13 NHL season lockout.

On 15 January 2013, Zetterberg was named captain of the Red Wings, succeeding Lidström who had retired. Despite missing 13 games due to chronic back problems, he scored over 40 points through the first part of the 2013–14 NHL season. However, he sustained another back injury during the 2014 Winter Olympics and underwent surgery, causing him to miss an estimated two months of the season while the Red Wings pursued a berth in the NHL playoffs for the 23rd straight year. Zetterberg returned for the final two games of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs as the Red Wings were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals by the Boston Bruins. He elected not to play for Sweden in the 2014 IIHF World Championship to further recuperate from his back injury.

On 6 November 2015, Zetterberg recorded his 300th career goal, which was against James Reimer of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He became the seventh Swedish player to reach the 300 goal plateau, and the fifth player in Red Wings franchise history to have 300 goals and 800 points, following Gordie Howe, Alex Delvecchio, Steve Yzerman, and Sergei Fedorov.

On 9 April 2017, he played his 1,000th game for the Red Wings organization, as well as became the seventh in franchise history in total points, the game was also the last at Joe Louis Arena.

During the 2017–18 season, Zetterberg reached several milestones. On 24 February 2018, he recorded his 335th career goal, tying him with Ted Lindsay for fifth all time in goals scored in franchise history. On 29 March 2018, he recorded his 954th career point, tying him with Sergei Fedorov for fifth all time in total points in franchise history.

On 14 September 2018, Red Wings general manager Ken Holland announced that due to a degenerative back condition, Zetterberg would be unable to continue with his NHL career. However, due to Zetterberg having had 3 years left on his contract at the time of the announcement, he did not officially retire until his contract expired following the 2020–21 season.

==International play==

Zetterberg has been a consistent part of the Swedish national team, &quot;Tre Kronor&quot;, since 2001. He has enjoyed a fair amount of success in the IIHF World Championships, winning a medal in four of the five years he appeared in the tournament. He was one of just three non-NHLers named to the Swedish squad for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Zetterberg won a gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and then again at the 2006 IIHF World Championship in Riga, playing a part in the international sweep. Sweden became the first team in hockey history to win the Olympic gold and the World Championship in the same year.

With the 2008 Stanley Cup championship, Zetterberg became a member of the Triple Gold Club. The term is used for an exclusive group of ice hockey players who have won Olympic gold, World Championship gold, and the Stanley Cup. Zetterberg is one of 29 members of this exclusive club, a club that also includes several teammates and his long-time head coach. Zetterberg along with teammates and fellow Swedes Niklas Kronwall and Mikael Samuelsson are the fastest to accomplish this feat, requiring only two years, three months and ten days.

Zetterberg was named captain of Team Sweden for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. On-going troubles with a herniated disc in his back, which caused Zetterberg to miss 13 games with the Red Wings earlier in the season, forced Zetterberg out of the 2014 Winter Olympics after one game. Teammate Niklas Kronwall was named captain for the remainder of the tournament.

Zetterberg was named to Team Sweden for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. On 11 August 2016, Zetterberg was named captain of the team. However, on 1 September, Zetterberg withdrew from the tournament due to a knee injury. He was replaced by Calgary Flames forward Mikael Backlund and Henrik Sedin was named the captain in his place.

==Personal life==
Zetterberg goes by the nicknames of &quot;Zäta&quot; (pronounced &quot;Zaeta,&quot; which means &quot;Z&quot; in Swedish) and &quot;Hank,&quot; an anglicized shortening of Henrik that is used by his Red Wings teammates.

In the summer of 2008 he became engaged to Emma Andersson, a Swedish model and TV host. On 23 July 2010, Zetterberg married his fiancée near the bride&#x27;s hometown in Mölle, Sweden.

On 20 August 2015, Andersson gave birth to their first child, a son named Love (pronounced Loo-VEY).

Zetterberg served several months in the Swedish Army when he was 17 years old—a rare thing among NHL players—as Sweden at that time had a conscription policy.

==In popular culture==
In 2009, film-makers Greg DeLiso and Jakob Hawkins released a video series called &quot;Fun With Henrik Zetterberg.&quot; The videos centre around a bumbling Henrik Zetterberg look-alike (played by Hawkins) and were positioned as spec commercial spots for the NHL and their affiliates. Although the spots were never picked up, the videos themselves went viral, garnering over 50,000 views in two days. The success of the videos spawned &quot;Fake Henrik Zettererg,&quot; a twelve-episode web series authored by DeLiso and Hawkins. The series was launched on 26 October 2011 and has been featured on Yahoo Sports and The Huffington Post. The series featured Kevin Brown and Austin Pendleton.

<doc id="1105859" wikidata="Q5546015" url="?curid=1105859" title="George Washington Riggs">
<text>George Washington Riggs (July 4, 1813 – August 24, 1881) was an American businessman and banker. He was known as &quot;The President&#x27;s Banker.&quot; He was a trustee of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the Peabody Education Fund.

== Early life==
Riggs was born in Georgetown, D.C., which is now part of Washington, D.C., the son of Elisha Riggs and his first wife, Alice ( Lawrason) Riggs. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1817, his father remarried to Mary Ann Karrick with whom he had several more children, in 1822.

His grandfather was silversmith Lt. Samuel Riggs, and his great-grandfather was John Riggs, who was mentioned in a will in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, as early as 1716. George was brought up in Baltimore, to which his father removed after he took George Peabody into partnership and established the firm of Riggs &amp; Peabody there. He went to the Round Hill School kept by George Bancroft and Joseph Green Cogswell at Northampton, Massachusetts, and entered Yale College in 1829, but left some time in his junior year. He traveled abroad, and, returning to America, worked for his father in the mercantile firm of Riggs, Taylor &amp; Company in New York City.

==Career==
In 1840, William W. Corcoran took him into partnership in the banking firm of Corcoran &amp; Riggs at Washington, D.C. The firm was immediately successful; it was able to obtain a major share of the loans required by the federal government, acquired a reputation in financing the Mexican–American War, and made large profits. In 1848 he gave up his connection with the firm, to which, however, his younger half-brother Elisha succeeded so that the firm name remained the same. When Corcoran retired in 1854, Riggs bought his interest. Under the firm name of Riggs &amp; Company (since 1896 Riggs Bank), he directed the business until his death.

From 1855 to 1862 he served on the Levy Court of Washington County. The Levy Court acted as County Commission for what was by then all of Washington, DC.

He was a member of the board of aldermen of the District of Columbia, in 1873 was chairman of a committee to present to Congress a petition asking for an investigation into the conduct of the board of public works, helped to obtain a committee report favorable to the abolition of the existing territorial form of government, and was active in the establishment of the present (1934) form of government that vests all authority in Congress. He built and owned the Riggs House, a famous hotel of his time, and was one of the organizers of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. He was a trustee of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and of the Peabody Education Fund. He was for many years the treasurer of the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association of the Union. In 1864 he advanced the money to maintain Mount Vernon until the return of peace should make it possible for the society again to raise funds.

==Personal life==
On June 23, 1840, he was married to Janet Madeleine Cecilia Shedden, the daughter of Thomas Shedden of Glasgow, Scotland. They had nine children, including:

* Alice Lawrason Riggs (1841–1927), who died unmarried.
* Catherine Shedden Riggs (1842–1881), who married Louis de Geofroy, French Ambassador to China and French Minister to Japan.
* Cecilia Dowdall Riggs (1844–1907), who married the British diplomat Sir Henry Howard in 1867.
* Janet Madeleine Riggs (1845–1861), who died young.
* Mary Griffith Riggs (1847–1849), who died young.
* George Shedden Riggs (1849–1856), who died young.
* Elisha Francis Riggs (1851–1910), who married Medora Thayer, a daughter of James Smith Thayer, in 1879.
* Jane Agnes Riggs (1853–1930), who died unmarried.
* Thomas Lawrason Riggs (1858–1888).

==Death==
Riggs died at his home, Green Hill, in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The Green Hill estate included suburbs northeast of Washington, D.C., including Adelphi, Chillum, and Lewisdale. Although an Episcopal Protestant in early life, he received the last rites of the Catholic Church. He is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, near Riggs Road in Washington, D.C.

===Relations and descendants===
His grandniece, Kate Cheeseman Riggs, married Edward Newton Perkins, the grandson of U.S. Secretary of State, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator William M. Evarts and the brother of famed editor Maxwell Perkins; uncles of Watergate Scandal special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

== In fiction ==
George Riggs is a character in the historical novel Forty-Ninth by Boris Pronsky and Craig Britton.

From Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Matheny was selected by the Brewers in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB draft from the University of Michigan (UM). He made his MLB debut as a member of the Milwaukee Brewers on April 7, 1994. Matheny established major league records among catchers for consecutive games played without committing an error (252), and consecutive chances fielded without an error (1,565). He is one of three catchers in major league history with an errorless season of at least 100 games, and in 2005, set a Giants single-season team record for catcher&#x27;s fielding percentage at .999. Matheny has made two World Series appearances—both with the Cardinals—one as a player (2004), and one as a manager (2013). He retired from playing in 2006 due to persisting symptoms of concussion, and has since become an advocate for its prevention and for improved catcher safety.

After his playing career, Matheny coached Little League Baseball. The Cardinals hired him to manage after the 2011 season although he had no professional coaching or managerial experience. In 2012, the Cardinals were wild card winners, and from 2013–15, claimed three consecutive NL Central titles, including winning a career-best 100 games for Matheny in 2015. He became the first manager in MLB history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first four seasons, and the fifth to a League Championship Series appearance in each of his first three. In 2018, he became the fourth Cardinals manager to manage the club in 1,000 games.

==Early life and amateur career==
Matheny grew up in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. He graduated from Reynoldsburg High School, where he captained the baseball and football teams. He received little attention from nearby Ohio State University, but accepted a scholarship offered by University of Michigan coach Bud Middaugh. At Michigan, Matheny co-captained the Wolverines baseball team.

Matheny&#x27;s defensive and throwing skills had drawn the notice of major league scouts, and the Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the 31st round of the 1988 Major League Baseball Draft. They waited two days until after the draft ended to tell him of his selection, and initially refused to disclose which round they had selected him in. Two days before he was due to attend his first class at Michigan, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny&#x27;s home to convince him to sign. Gillick was ready to offer a deal normally reserved for second-round picks. At the time, teams held the right to negotiate with their draft picks until the moment they entered their first classroom in the following academic year. The Blue Jays called Matheny frequently until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign. However, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Before proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them of his decision.

Matheny was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team. In 1990, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star.

==Playing career (1991–2006)==

===Minor leagues, Milwaukee Brewers and Toronto Blue Jays (1991–99)===
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Matheny in the eighth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft, and he spent three years climbing the minor league system. He made his major league debut with the Brewers on April 7, 1994, at the age of 23; he became their starting catcher early in the next season.

During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1998, Matheny was batting in the bottom of the ninth when he took a pitch from Rich Loiselle off his face. Remaining upright, Matheny placed his hand on his hip as Pirates catcher Jason Kendall and home plate umpire Jerry Crawford motioned wildly for the Brewers trainers. He spat out a mouthful of blood as he walked off the field. At the end of that season, he became eligible for salary arbitration and the Brewers granted him free agency a few months later.

Ten years after they drafted him, the Toronto Blue Jays signed him on December 23, 1998, for the 1999 season. He served as Darrin Fletcher&#x27;s understudy. Toronto released him after the season, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 15, 1999.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2000–04)===
Matheny barely made the Cardinals roster after the spring training session, but went on to earn the starting catcher&#x27;s role in the 2000 season. He posted a career-high .261 batting average and provided exceptional defense for the Cardinals, with a .993 fielding percentage and throwing out 53% of would-be base stealers, well above the league average of 32%. Matheny helped the Cardinals improve from their fourth-place finish in 1999 to capturing the National League Central Division title, and claimed his first Gold Glove award in the process. After the season, the Cardinals signed him to a three-year, $9 million contract.

After teammate Darryl Kile&#x27;s sudden death in the summer of 2002, Matheny showed that he was &quot;an inspirational leader&quot;, helping the team to cope and make it to the National League Championship Series. After the 2003 season, the St. Louis and Houston chapters of the BBWAA voted for Matheny as the inaugural winner of an award established in Kile&#x27;s honor.

Bolstering his growing reputation as a top defensive catcher, Matheny again won Gold Gloves with the Cardinals in 2003 and 2004. His defensive contributions helped St. Louis reach the postseason in four of his five years with the team, including claiming the National League pennant in 2004. Between August 1, 2002, and August 4, 2004, Matheny played in 252 games without committing an error, establishing a new Major League record for catchers.

Matheny set another Major League record for catchers in 2004 by fielding 1,565 consecutive chances without an error. During his playing days in a Cardinal uniform, Matheny caught 611 games, accumulating 4,938.1 innings and committing just 14 errors. His .997 fielding percentage leads all catchers who have caught at least 2,000 innings for St. Louis. He became a free agent after the 2004 World Series, primarily due to the emergence of rookie catcher Yadier Molina, with whom he would eventually be reunited.

===San Francisco Giants (2005–06)===

Matheny signed a three-year contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 13, 2004. The next season, he displayed a rare power surge, amassing career-highs with 13 home runs, 34 doubles, a .406 slugging percentage and 59 runs batted in (RBIs). Matheny continued his defensive excellence, compiling a team-record .999 fielding percentage and leading National League catchers with 13 double plays, 77 assists, and 39 base-stealers caught stealing, earning his fourth Gold Glove. He also took home the Willie Mac Award that year, accorded annually to a San Francisco Giant for spirit and leadership.

Matheny landed on the disabled list on May 31, 2006, after a series of foul balls caromed off his mask, resulting in a serious concussion. In July, the Giants announced that he would not return for the remainder of the season and that his career status was in doubt. MLB.com&#x27;s Giants beat writer, Rich Draper, articulated that Matheny&#x27;s career was likely over due to continued struggles with post-concussion syndrome.

===Retirement and career statistics===
On February 1, 2007, Matheny announced his retirement from Major League Baseball at the age of 35 due to ongoing symptoms of post-concussion syndrome. Shortly thereafter, Matheny became a baseball mentor for Protégé Sports and filming some catching tips and drills for the Scottsdale-based company.

In his 13-year major league career, Matheny played in 1,305 games, accumulating 925 hits in 3,877 at-bats for a .239 career batting average, along with 67 home runs, 443 RBIs, and an on-base percentage of .293. He led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage and ended his career with a .994 average, which was four points above the league average during his playing career. His .994 career fielding percentage ranks tenth all-time among Major League catchers. Matheny also twice led National League catchers in base-runners caught stealing.

==Managerial career (2012–2018; 2020–2022)==
===St. Louis Cardinals===
====Hiring====
On January 24, 2008, Matheny returned to the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a special adviser for the first two weeks of spring training. They announced him as their new manager on November 14, 2011, following Tony La Russa&#x27;s retirement, making him the youngest manager in the major leagues. Matheny&#x27;s other prior coaching experience included Little League Baseball and other interviewees included Terry Francona, Ryne Sandberg, José Oquendo, Chris Maloney and Joe McEwing, all of whom already had managerial or coaching experience in the major leagues.

====First season as manager (2012)====
On April 4, 2012, Matheny won in his managerial debut against the Miami Marlins in the first game at their new ballpark, Marlins Park. Twenty days later, Matheny was ejected from a game for the first time for arguing a pivotal safe/out call by umpire Bill Welke in the bottom of the 10th inning of a 3–2 loss to the Chicago Cubs.

Matheny&#x27;s first season as Cardinals manager was an overall success, finishing the regular season with an 88–74 record en route to capturing the National League wild-card game and qualifying for the postseason. The Giants defeated the Cardinals in the NLCS.

====2013–14====

On February 14, 2013, the Cardinals picked up Matheny&#x27;s 2014 option. He surpassed the success of his first season by guiding the club in 2013 to a 97–65 record, the best record in the National League, and his first National League Central division title. The Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–2 in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers 4–2 in the NLCS for his first NL pennant. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cardinals in the World Series in six games, with many similarities to 2004, when Matheny was also a key member of the team (as catcher)—the Cardinals finished with the best record in the NL, and the Red Sox likewise defeated the Cardinals in the World Series. However, in 2013, St. Louis lost four key players to season-ending injuries, including Chris Carpenter, Rafael Furcal, Jaime García and Jason Motte—rookies comprised half of the World Series pitching staff. On November 20, 2013, the Cardinals extended his contract for three more years through 2017.

Making his first All-Star appearance as a major leaguer, Matheny was the National League manager in the 2014 game, which the American League won, 5–3. The Cardinals won the NL Central division title in 2014, their second consecutive title, and third consecutive playoff appearance with Matheny as manager. More trends continued as they eliminated the Dodgers from the playoffs for the second consecutive season, this time in the NLDS. Just like in 2012, the Giants eliminated the Cardinals in the NLCS.

====2015====
After defeating the Chicago Cubs 10–9 on May 4, 2015, the Cardinals sported an MLB-best 19–6 record, which was the best 25-game start for the club since at least 1900. Having won seven in a row, it established a career-high for Matheny. The Cardinals defeated the Cubs again the next game, 7–4, extending the win streak to eight. A 3–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on May 17, 2015, secured the 300th win of his managerial career. In August 2015, &quot;Baseball America&quot; published that fellow managers and coaches in the National League rated Matheny the second-best manager in the league. On September 19, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to advance to the playoffs. Matheny became the first manager in MLB history to guide his club to the postseason in each of his first four full seasons. With an 11–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30, the Cardinals won 100 games for the first time in Matheny&#x27;s managerial career, while clinching their third consecutive NL Central division title. The Pirates, who had kept close for most of the season, had already won 96 games, while clinching a wild-card berth. However, the Cubs, the second wild-card entrant, defeated the Cardinals in the NLDS in four games. Matheny finished second in the NL Manager of the Year Award voting, and was a co-winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year Award.

====2016−2018====
On May 27, 2016, Matheny gained his 400th career win in a 6–2 defeat of the Washington Nationals. In 2016, Matheny&#x27;s contract was extended to 2022.

On May 1, 2018, Matheny became the fourth person, after Red Schoendienst, Whitey Herzog, and Tony La Russa, to manage 1,000 Cardinals games. He was fired by the Cardinals on July 14, 2018. His 2018 record was 47–46 and his career in St. Louis over 1,065 games was 591–474 (.555).

===Kansas City Royals===
On October 31, 2019, Matheny was hired as manager of the Kansas City Royals after the retirement of Ned Yost. The Royals exercised a contract option on March 31, 2022, retaining Matheny through the 2023 season. On October 5, 2022, the Royals announced Matheny would not return as manager for the 2023 season.

==Personal life==
Matheny&#x27;s wife, Kristen, is a former field hockey player at the University of Michigan. They have five children together. Their oldest son, Tate, played college baseball at Missouri State University and was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 4th round of the 2015 MLB Draft. Their daughter, Katie, played ice hockey at Ohio State. To date, two of the younger Matheny sons have played baseball collegiately—Luke for Saint Louis University and Blaise for Missouri State University. Matheny majored in sports management and communications with an emphasis in Spanish.

Matheny routinely chronicles his life experiences and maintains a blog of which topics includes leadership and changing the culture of youth sports. He is a devout Christian, often including Bible verse citations when he signs autographs.

===Charity work===
Matheny organized and created Catch-22, a charitable organization (named for his playing position and uniform number) which donated tickets for Cardinals games between 2002 and 2004. In 2005, Matheny opened the Catch-22 Miracle Field at the Chesterfield Valley Athletic complex in Chesterfield, Missouri. The field has a completely flat and firm rubber surface and other features to allow children with a wide array of physical and mental handicaps to participate.
===Real estate===
Unprofitable real estate transactions left Matheny heavily in debt. In 2005, Matheny founded MPD Partnership with two former professional indoor soccer players, Daryl Doran and Brett Phillips. They purchased a block of the WingHaven development in St. Charles and realized a $2.4 million profit in six months. After Doran left the partnership to start a gym, Matheny and Phillips used their money to secure an $11.8 million loan from the Business Bank of St. Louis for an 11-acre tract near Interstate 64. That investment lost money, at least partially due to the financial crisis of 2007–08, and Matheny wound up more than $4 million in debt. In May 2010, he wrote to the Business Bank to say that he would not repay the remainder of the loan. The bank sued him one month later.

In 2010, he lost a 17-room house in Wildwood, Missouri, following insolvency on two commercial plots in near Chesterfield Valley.

Matheny&#x27;s attorney, Robert Blitz, was handling a similar case—Fischer and Frichtel, a homebuilder who also defaulted on assets after sustaining losses over the same time period, contends that they should not be fully liable for what is termed as &quot;deflationary debt&quot;. The St. Louis appellate court deferred the case to the Supreme Court of Missouri. In January 2013, a circuit court ruling determined that the Matheny partnership owed the Business Bank $4.4 million.
