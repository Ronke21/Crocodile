<text>The 2001 Alberta general election was held on March 12, 2001 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.

The incumbent Alberta Progressive Conservative Party, led by Ralph Klein, won a strong majority for its tenth consecutive term in government. In addition to increasing its share of the popular vote to almost 62%, the PC Party won a majority of seats in Edmonton for the first time since 1982. In the process, they reduced the opposition to only nine MLAs in total. It was the Tories&#x27; biggest majority since the height of the Peter Lougheed era.

The Liberal Party lost 11 seats and ran up a large debt. Its leader, Nancy MacBeth, was defeated in her riding.

The New Democratic Party, led by Raj Pannu, hoped to make gains at the expense of the Liberals in Edmonton and replace them as the official opposition. This did not materialize, but the party did manage to maintain its share of the popular vote and held onto their two seats in the legislature. The NDP attempted to attract young voters with the slogan, &quot;Raj against the Machine&quot;.

The right-wing Alberta First Party, contesting its first election, failed to win any seats or come close to winning any. The Social Credit Party, led by James Albers, was unable to build on its moderate success in the 1997 election, and sank back into obscurity. Socred leader Lavern Ahlstrom, however, performed well in Rocky Mountain House and finished second behind the incumbent Ty Lund.

<doc id="1100044" wikidata="Q6649673" url="?curid=1100044" title="Little Creatures Brewery">
<text>Little Creatures is a brewery based in Fremantle, Western Australia, operating as a subsidiary of the Japanese firm Kirin Company. It is owned by Little World Beverages, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lion which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Kirin.

Little Creatures was originally established in 2000 by the original brewers of the Matilda Bay Brewing Company. The name &quot;Little Creatures&quot; is inspired by a song lyric from Talking Heads&#x27; album &quot;Little Creatures&quot; and refers to the live yeast cells that turn the sugars in malt wort into ethanol.

==History==
Little Creatures Brewery was founded by Howard Cearns (a marketing specialist), Nic Trimboli (a restaurateur) and Phil Sexton (a master brewer), all of whom previously worked with the Matilda Bay Brewing Company. In 1997 Cearns, Trimboli and Sexton discussed the possibility of brewing an American style India Pale Ale. Sexton, having worked in the United States, was involved in the development of the BridgePort IPA. Cearns came up with the name after reading about little creatures wandering from ale house to ale house in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and at the time thinking that it sounded like yeast fermentation. The brewery released its first beer, &quot;Little Creatures Pale Ale&quot;, in 2000.
The Company sponsors the Fremantle Print Award.
In 2008 the company established a second brewery in Healesville, Victoria. 
In 2012 the company was bought by Lion Nathan 
In 2013 another brewery was opened in Geelong, Victoria, at a cost of $60 million. Brewing capacity is reported as &quot; a year, or 80 kegs an hour.&quot;

==Brewery==
The brewery building was originally constructed to house the Taskforce &#x27;87 yachts (such as Kookaburra) participating in the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup. But it housed a crocodile farm before being converted to its current use. The brewery is open to the public and contains a café restaurant.

==Brands==

<doc id="1100045" wikidata="Q6457531" url="?curid=1100045" title="Mormon cinema">
<text>Mormon cinema usually refers to films with themes relevant to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The term has also been used to refer to films that do not necessarily reflect Mormon themes but have been made by Mormon filmmakers. Films within the realm of Mormon cinema may be distinguished from institutional films produced by the LDS Church, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Testaments,&quot; which are made for instructional or proselyting purposes and are non-commercial. Mormon cinema is produced mainly for the purposes of entertainment and potential financial success.

Though Latter-day Saints have been involved in the film industry in various ways since the early 20th century, independent Mormon cinema is a relatively new phenomenon. Many scholars and filmmakers accredit Richard Dutcher&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; with ushering in the modern Mormon cinema movement. Following the commercial success of Dutcher&#x27;s film, Mormon producers and directors began to market distinctly Mormon movies to LDS audiences, especially those living in the Mormon Corridor. This began with a wave of Mormon comedy movies, such as &quot;The Singles Ward&quot; (2002) and &quot;The R.M.&quot; (2003), that focused on the more comedic aspects of the culture surrounding the religion. Films within the Mormon cinema subgenre typically rely heavily on LDS themes and are marketed mostly toward Latter-day Saints, though there has been an effort to &quot;cross over&quot; into more general topics and appeal to a wider audience. Generally, Latter-day Saints produce and direct the films. Over the years, Mormon cinema has explored a variety of production methods: widespread commercial release, single-theatre release, and direct-to-DVD release.

Production of Mormon films has slowed since the early 2000s, but those in the niche industry continue to release movies covering distinctly LDS topics, such as Mormon missionaries and LDS Church history. Theological elements, such as man&#x27;s ability to be close to God, remain present in Mormon films.

== Defining &quot;Mormon cinema&quot; ==
There is debate surrounding what should and should not be classified as &quot;Mormon cinema.&quot; For example, Don Bluth&#x27;s animated films, such as &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988) and &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997), carry some themes and undertones that coincide with the director&#x27;s religion but lack overtly LDS characteristics. Preston Hunter, one of the creators of ldsfilm.com, limits the definition of Mormon cinema to films released commercially. They must be made, according to Hunter, by members of the church, and feature &quot;overtly Latter-day Saint characters or themes.&quot; This definition would exclude &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940) because its director, Henry Hathaway, was not a member of the church. That film, however, harbored obvious Mormon aspects; church leaders at the time even had a hand in its production. In the absence of definite criteria, the definition of Mormon cinema often shifts to reflect whatever is included in the annual LDS Film Festival.

==History==
=== Early 20th-century Mormon films ===
Prior to the advent of filmmaking, a major shift occurred in the LDS Church from isolationism to a period of growth. In the 1890s, the practice of plural marriage ended, and Utah became a U.S. state. This context provided Mormons with a reason to begin making films once the technology presented itself; they wanted to portray contemporary Mormonism to a wide audience. The church produced institutional films shortly after the industry was born. Independently, however, Latter-day Saints were somewhat hesitant to adopt filmmaking as a method of storytelling. The early 20th-century leaders of the LDS Church warned members against the potentially detrimental effects of cinema on society. However, the abundance of sensationalist pictures with anti-Mormon themes during the silent film era resulted in the desire on the part of Mormons to combat these portrayals with their own. By 1913, an article in &quot;The Young Woman&#x27;s Journal,&quot; a Latter-day Saint publication, declared that the new medium of film would &quot;help the world at large to an understanding of our [Mormon] history.&quot; Subsequently, the 1920s saw a boom in theater construction in Utah and the number of Mormon moviegoers. By the 1930s and 40s, movies had become key component of Latter-day Saint life. Lester Card&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1931) was the first film within the Mormon niche to be commercially released, though it disappointed both audiences and investors. Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940) was much more successful; a celebration was held in Salt Lake City on the film&#x27;s release date, and &quot;Brigham Young&quot; became the film with &quot;the largest premiere in American history to that point.&quot;

==== Silent film era ====

Between the years 1905 and 1915, nineteen known movies portraying Mormonism were produced. These were not, however, made by Latter-day Saints; many were lurid tales of hypnotic missionaries and Western pioneer stories with storylines revolving around massacres or kidnappings. The LDS church worked with LDS and non-LDS directors alike to create films that painted the history of Utah and Mormonism in a more positive light, but &quot;harsh depictions&quot; of Mormons—such as those in &quot;A Victim of the Mormons&quot; (1911), &quot;A Mormon Maid&quot; (1917), and &quot;Trapped by the Mormons&quot; (1922)—overshadowed those church-produced films—such as &quot;One Hundred Years of Mormonism&quot; (1913) and &quot;The Life of Nephi&quot; (1915)—in the market. In 1930, however, the adoption of the Motion Picture Production Code (MPPC) required gentler treatment of religious subject matters; it prohibited films that featured &quot;the ridicule of religious denominations, their leaders, or adherents.&quot; Thus, the production of anti-Mormon silent films slowed to a halt.

&quot;One Hundred Years&quot; was considered a large-scale production for its time; it was 90 minutes long and involved &quot;a cast of over a thousand, an elaborate reconstruction of sections of [the city of] Nauvoo, and four concurrently running cameras&quot;. It told in detail the story of the LDS Church, beginning with the birth of its founder, Joseph Smith, and constituted one hundred scenes. In the realm of Mormon cinema, &quot;One Hundred Years of Mormonism&quot; &quot;remains the single most important commercial film release of the silent cinema,&quot; mainly because of its being directly influenced by people who themselves had been Mormon pioneers. It was shown in theaters worldwide; cinemas in Buenos Aires, Sydney, Peking, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, and London requested reels. Only a few minutes of the film survive today.

From 1916 to 1929, brothers Shirley and Chester Clawson made the first documentary-style films for the church. They recorded segments of the church&#x27;s semiannual General Conference, shots of LDS landmarks (such as Temple Square), and scenes from the everyday lives of general authorities of the church. Most of their work was destroyed in a fire in 1929.

=== Growth and development, 1958–2000 ===
In the 1950s, the Brigham Young University (BYU) Motion Picture Department was created, and in 1958 it grew into the BYU Motion Picture Studio (BYU MPS). This was a major step towards greater autonomy for the Mormon cinema industry; though most of the work produced at the BYU MPS was non-commercial and church-produced, it paved the way for the creation of independent Mormon cinema. Overall, the LDS film industry became much more established from the 1950s-70s under the influence of David O. McKay and Wetzel Whitaker. In 1978, Spencer W. Kimball called for Mormon filmmakers to create &quot;masterpiece[s] which would live forever.&quot;

The range of years from 1973 to 2000 has been called the &quot;Mass Media Era&quot; in Mormon cinema. Particularly in the years before the internet, the church encouraged its members to look to its &quot;correlated&quot;—that is, church-produced—films and filmstrips for information and faith-building entertainment. The films produced during this time mostly fit into that category; they were products of the church itself, not of its members independently. However, a growing number of Latter-day Saints began to work in the entertainment industry.

=== The birth of modern Mormon cinema: 2000-2006 ===
In more recent decades, Mormon-made and -themed films produced neither by the church nor by big Hollywood film studios have garnered recognition among LDS audiences. The Mormon cinema movement began in 2000, when director Richard Dutcher realized the potential for a Mormon niche within the film industry and commercially released &quot;God&#x27;s Army,&quot; a movie depicting LDS missionaries in Los Angeles. He wanted to improve the way Mormon characters were portrayed on screen. The film, which was produced on a budget of $300,000, grossed upwards of $2.5 million at the box office. &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; was unique for the time in that it combined a number of unfamiliar factors: an LDS director, an LDS subject matter, a theatrical distribution, and a marketing campaign that targeted Mormon moviegoers. It earned Dutcher the title of &quot;the father of modern Latter-day Saint cinema.&quot; &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot;&#x27;s release marked a major shift in the subgenre; it was not the first widely shown Mormon film, but it demonstrated the viability of such a film achieving relative commercial success.

==== Mormon comedies ====
Observing the financial success of &quot;God&#x27;s Army,&quot; Kurt Hale and Dave Hunter founded Halestorm Entertainment in 2001 and focused the new company&#x27;s efforts on making and distributing Mormon movies. Halestorm began releasing slapstick comedies with Mormon-centric humor in the early 2000s, including titles such as &quot;The R.M.&quot; (2003), &quot;The Home Teachers&quot; (2004), &quot;Baptists at Our Barbecue&quot; (2004), &quot;Sons of Provo&quot; (2004), and &quot;Mobsters and Mormons&quot; (2005). The company kept production costs low by filming in its home state of Utah or in nearby Arizona or Idaho. Alongside Halestorm, Excel Entertainment (founded by former Disney executive Jeff Simpson) and Zion Films have spearheaded the production and distribution of Mormon cinema.

Films that rely heavily on the viewers&#x27; understanding of LDS vocabulary, social norms and self-deprecating cultural humor rarely find success among general audiences. This was true of satirical comedies &quot;The Singles Ward&quot; (2002), &quot;The R.M.,&quot; and &quot;The Home Teachers&quot;. &quot;Singles Ward,&quot; branded &quot;the first major LDS comedy,&quot; focuses on a subgroup of Mormon culture: young adults in Utah Valley searching for future spouses. In a discussion of these comedies, screenwriter and director Randy Astle writes that &quot;many of the jokes and references [are] incomprehensible for Church members as close as Idaho, let alone India.&quot; The films also tended to lack depth, &quot;[poking] fun at the faith without offering much insight.&quot; Director Richard Dutcher and reviewers Sean P. Means and Thomas Baggaley responded to the early 2000s&#x27; wave of Mormon films by expressing concern over the way the subgenre was headed. They worried about directors and production companies relying too heavily on Mormon-centric humor and the newness of Mormon cinema instead of producing quality films with worthwhile plotlines. These movies did, however, prove to be popular among Latter-day Saint audiences. Terryl Givens, associate professor of English, attributes this success to the desire of Mormon audiences to see their own &quot;distinctive eccentricities&quot; represented on the screen. He writes: &quot;The popularity of these comedic films seems in part to derive from a people hungry for entertainment that validates their own cultural specificity. Like insiders to a private joke, Mormons can comfortably laugh at a genre that ... promotes Mormon cohesion and reifies and confirms Mormon self-definition.&quot; In an interview, Will Swenson, director of &quot;Sons of Provo,&quot; stated that &quot;representation matters. People &quot;want&quot; to see themselves on-screen. And there are a ton of Mormons out there.&quot; However, by 2006, Halestorm discovered that the enthusiasm for Mormon-centric movies had died down. The niche was too new to support the many films that were being produced for it. So, Halestorm pivoted by rebranding a part of itself as &quot;Stone Five Studios&quot; and releasing its next comedy, &quot;Church Ball&quot; (2006), with less references to religion and Mormon culture. Richard Dutcher released a follow-up to &quot;God&#x27;s Army, States of Grace,&quot; in 2005, but some Mormon moviegoers disapproved of the film for its &quot;not altogether positive depiction of Mormons.&quot; In 2006, author Dean C. Hale proposed that most Mormons simply do not take an interest in Mormon cinema. This, he said, may be related to the LDS Church encouraging its members to prioritize other aspects of life—such as family—before entertainment.

==== Efforts at mass appeal and growth ====
LDS film directors have been attempting to appeal to a national audience since the early 2000s. The 2003 crossover film &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice: A Latter-day Comedy,&quot; for example, avoided direct references to Mormonism. Its director, Andrew Black, sought to focus on other elements of the story, with Mormon culture as &quot;just a backdrop.&quot; Professor Travis T. Anderson argues that LDS films revolving around universal human themes—such as &quot;challenges, struggles, desire, and day-to-day experiences&quot;—with just a splash of religious undertones achieve success in the movie market despite the Mormon cultural aspects they carry, which can seem strange to general audiences. He cites &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; (2001), &quot;Saints and Soldiers&quot; (2003), &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; (2004), and &quot;New York Doll&quot; (2005) as examples of such &quot;critical and financial success stories in Mormon cinema.&quot; &quot;Saints and Soldiers&quot; gained recognition at multiple small film festivals; and the 2001 murder mystery &quot;Brigham City&quot;, while not praised by audiences, received critical acclaim. The documentary &quot;New York Doll&quot; tells the story of a member of a rock band—who also happens to be Mormon—and the reconciliation of his two worlds. It demonstrates the commonly-held goal of Mormon filmmakers to bridge the gap between how Mormons are perceived and the concept of the typical American. Larry Miller, owner of the Utah jazz, invested millions of dollars into producing &quot;The Work and the Glory&quot; (2004) in an effort to tell the story of the history of the LDS Church. Mormon filmmakers have often made the argument that films with distinctly Mormon characteristics have the potential to appeal to general audiences. Additionally, LDS films have been featured in theaters around the United States. Mormon cinema has also been the subject of aesthetic discussion. Doc Films, a student film society at the University of Chicago, hosted a Mormon film series in 2007.

Some Mormon films were marketed differently to the larger market than they were to their niche audience. The national release DVD cover of &quot;Brigham City,&quot; for example, featured &quot;much more implied violence&quot; than the cover released to the Mormon Corridor. When new films were released, their launch was often accompanied by the creation of a website dedicated to promoting the film. Most of the family-oriented films marketed to Mormon audiences never made it to theaters, but went right to DVD distribution through large and small e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and LDSVideoStore.com. Deseret Book Company and Seagull Book were at the forefront of Mormon DVD distribution. In general, the most successful Mormon films were those made with high-quality equipment and distributed by an entertainment company, such as Halestorm or Excel Entertainment.

As the Mormon film industry blossomed, so did commentary and criticism. In 2000, the Association for Mormon Letters created a film category for its AML Awards. That same year, Preston Hunter and Thomas Baggaley created ldsfilm.com, which became the central hub for discussions and announcements concerning Mormon cinema. The site provided a place for &quot;a Mormon film community&quot; to form, helping visitors stay apprised of upcoming LDS movies. Then in 2001, the first LDS Film Festival was held in Provo, Utah. Attendance more than doubled at the event&#x27;s fifth year. The modern Mormon cinema movement was large enough to spawn celebrities, such as Kirby Heyborne, within the Mormon community. As of 2009, there were 4,591 entries of film or television shows in the Mormon Literature and Creative Arts Database. The term &quot;Mollywood&quot;—a portmanteau of &quot;Mormon&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;—was used to describe the films of this era.

== Present day ==
Eric Samuelsen, associate professor of theatre and media arts, has noted that &quot;many [LDS] films from 2005 onward have performed so poorly at the box office that the movement seems to have lost at least some of its momentum.&quot; In 2014, LDS actor Jim Bennett wrote in a &quot;Deseret News&quot; article that &quot;the hunger [for LDS films] is still there but the novelty has worn off.&quot; Some scholars have argued that the quality of LDS cinema has plateaued due to both directors and audiences &quot;ascertain[ing] what is morally wrong in films they see, and remain[ing] uninterested in seeking out, discriminating, or creating what is right (morally or aesthetically) in film.&quot; Publications such as &quot;BYU Studies Quarterly, Irreantum, Sunstone, and &quot; have featured criticism of LDS cinema. The Mormon blogosphere (sometimes referred to as the &quot;bloggernacle&quot;) has also contributed film reviews over the years.

Mormon filmmakers have continued to produce movies centered around LDS missionaries, but often from new perspectives; &quot;The Saratov Approach&quot; (2013) was a thriller set in Russia, &quot;The Errand of Angels&quot; (2008) focused on female missionaries, and &quot;Freetown&quot; (2015) told the story of African missionaries escaping the First Liberian Civil War. On the subject of film, author Heather Bigley writes: &quot;As American members [of the LDS Church] begin to think of themselves as part of a world-wide organization, efforts at self-definition abound.&quot; There have also been recent releases in the vein of LDS Church history, such as &quot;The Fighting Preacher&quot; (2019) and &quot;Out of Liberty&quot; (2019). The Mormon films released since 2005 have mainly been small, independent features. They are, however, arguably of a higher artistic quality than their predecessors, and tend to have a &quot;moral of the story.&quot; There has arguably been more variety in Mormon cinema in more recent years. In March 2021, LDS filmmaker Barrett Burgin argued that films made by and about Latter-day Saints still have the potential to be marketable to a larger audience, but stressed the need to prioritize storytelling over a missionary message. He also identified some elements of LDS doctrine, culture, history, and lore—such as polygamy, violence, buried treasure, folk magic, and miracles—as marketable film elements. These, he said, range from &quot;radically weird&quot; to &quot;clean-cut and conservative,&quot; and the intrigue surrounding that dichotomy could attract the interest of viewers.

The LDS Film Festival is still held annually in Orem, Utah, usually around the same time as the Sundance Film Festival. The 2020 festival commemorated 20 years of Mormon cinema: 20 years, that is, since the release of Richard Dutcher&#x27;s &quot;God&#x27;s Army,&quot; the film credited with starting the movement. The subgenre has become an important part of cultural expression for Latter-day Saints. Director and screenwriter Randy Astle has argued that, &quot;along with music and temple architecture, [film] is the most prominent Mormon art form&quot;. LDS films are commonly made in the Rocky Mountains, New England, New York City, and Los Angeles.

==MPAA ratings==
One aspect of the culture of LDS cinema is heightened concern over MPAA film ratings. Many members of the Church generally view R-rated films as taboo, but Latter-day Saints provide a substantial market for G- and PG-rated films. For example, a movie theater in Sandy, Utah was home to the highest attendance for viewings of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets;&quot; and, as of 2011, Latter-day Saints constituted 69% of Utah&#x27;s population. R-ratings are rare among Mormon-made films; they have been described as having &quot;a 1950s sensibility about them.&quot;

Following shakedown, &quot;Thatcher&quot; operated with the Atlantic Fleet into the autumn of 1919. During the transatlantic NC-boat flights in May 1919, the destroyer operated on picket station number 9—one of 21 stations strung out from Newfoundland to the Azores—between her sister ships and . Underway at sea, she provided visual and radio bearings for the flying boats as they passed overhead on their way toward Lisbon, Portugal.

Upon completion of this duty, the destroyer—reclassified as DD-162 on 17 July 1920—resumed her routine training operations off the eastern seaboard before heading west in the autumn of 1921 to join the Pacific Fleet. She operated out of San Diego, conducting exercises and training cruises off the west coast until decommissioned at San Diego on 7 June 1922.

&quot;Thatcher&quot; remained laid-up at San Diego through the summer of 1939. War broke out in Europe on 1 September 1939, when German troops invaded Poland. &quot;Thatcher&quot; was recommissioned at San Diego on 18 December 1939 and conducted shakedown and training evolutions off the west coast until transferred to the Atlantic the following spring. Transiting the Panama Canal on 1 April 1940, a month before the situation in Europe became critical when Germany began her blitzkrieg against France and the Low Countries, &quot;Thatcher&quot; subsequently conducted neutrality patrols and training cruises off the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico through the summer of 1940.

The European situation took a drastic turn with the fall of France in June 1940. British destroyer forces in the wake of the Norwegian campaign and the evacuation of Dunkirk found themselves thinly spread—especially after Italy entered the war on Germany&#x27;s side. Prime Minister Winston Churchill appealed to the United States for help.

In response, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order authorizing the transfer of 50 over-aged destroyers to the British in return for 99-year leases on strategic base sites in the Western Hemisphere. &quot;Thatcher&quot; was accordingly withdrawn from the Atlantic Squadron and her operations with Destroyer Division 69 for transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy, which had been allocated six of the &quot;50 ships that saved the world,&quot; as these vessels came to be known.

As such, &quot;Thatcher&quot; and her five sisters arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 20 September—the third group of the &quot;flush deckers&quot; transferred. Decommissioned on 24 September 1940, &quot;Thatcher&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

===Royal Canadian Navy===

Renamed HMCS &quot;Niagara&quot; following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), after the Niagara River forming the border between New York and Ontario. &quot;Niagara&quot; departed Halifax on 30 November; proceeded eastward via St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland; and arrived in the British Isles on 11 December. Early in 1941, the destroyer was allocated to the 4th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, and based at Greenock, Scotland. Subsequently transferred to the Newfoundland escort force, &quot;Niagara&quot; operated on convoy escort duties into the summer of 1941. While she was operating with this force, she took part in the capture of a German U-boat, &quot;U-570&quot;.

A Lockheed Hudson bomber, flying from Kaldaðarnes, southeast of Reykjavík, Iceland, located &quot;U-570&quot; running on the surface off the Icelandic coast on 27 August 1941. The Hudson attacked the U-boat with depth charges, damaging the enemy craft so severely that she could not submerge. Soon, some of the German crew appeared on deck displaying a large white cloth — possibly a bed sheet — indicating that they had surrendered. Patently unable to capture the submarine herself, the Hudson radioed for help.

&quot;Niagara&quot; sped to the scene and arrived at 08:20 on 28 August 1941. Rough weather initially hampered the operation but eventually, by 18:00, &quot;Niagara&quot; had placed a prize crew aboard the submarine and had taken &quot;U-570&quot; in tow. During the operation, she also took the 43-man crew of the enemy craft on board. Towed to Þorlákshöfn, Iceland, the U-boat eventually served in the Royal Navy as .

In January 1942, &quot;Niagara&quot; escorted the tempest-battered Danish merchantman &quot;Triton&quot; into Belfast, Northern Ireland, after the freighter had been severely mauled in a storm at sea. In March the destroyer rescued the survivors from the US merchantman SS &quot;Independence Hall&quot;, which had run aground off Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and had broken in half. The next month, she picked up two boatloads of survivors from the sunken steamer SS &quot;Rio Blanco&quot;, which had been torpedoed by on 1 April 1942, east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

The destroyer subsequently underwent boiler repairs at Pictou, Nova Scotia from May to August 1942 before resuming coastwise convoy operations between Halifax and New York and escort duty in the western Atlantic. Another refit at Pictou came in June and October 1943, before she continued her coastwise convoy escort missions through 1944.

&quot;Niagara&quot; became a torpedo-firing ship — first at Halifax and later at Saint John, New Brunswick — from the spring of 1945 until the end of World War II in mid-August 1945, training torpedomen. Decommissioned on 15 September 1945, &quot;Niagara&quot; was turned over to the War Assets Corporation on 27 May 1946 and broken up for scrap soon thereafter.

<doc id="1100050" wikidata="Q2270510" url="?curid=1100050" title="Kinin–kallikrein system">
<text>The kinin–kallikrein system or simply kinin system is a poorly understood hormonal system with limited available research. It consists of blood proteins that play a role in inflammation, blood pressure control, coagulation and pain. Its important mediators bradykinin and kallidin are vasodilators and act on many cell types. Clinical symptoms include marked weakness, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis and acceleration of ESR.

==History==
The system was discovered in 1909 when researchers discovered that injection with urine (high in kinins) led to hypotension (low blood pressure). The researchers Emil Karl Frey, Heinrich Kraut and Eugen Werle discovered high-molecular weight kininogen in urine around 1930.

===Etymology===
kinin [Gk] kīn(eîn) to move, set in motion. kallikrein [Gk ] kalli~ sweet and krein = kreos, flesh, named for the pancreatic extracts where it was first discovered

==Members==
The system consists of a number of large proteins, some small polypeptides and a group of enzymes that activate and deactivate the compounds.

===Proteins===
High-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low-molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) are precursors of the polypeptides. They have no activity of themselves.
* HMWK is produced by the liver together with prekallikrein (see below). It acts mainly as a cofactor on coagulation and inflammation, and has no intrinsic catalytic activity.
* LMWK is produced locally by numerous tissues, and secreted together with tissue kallikrein.

===Polypeptides===
* Bradykinin (BK), which acts on the B2 receptor and slightly on B1, is produced when kallikrein releases it from HMWK. It is a nonapeptide (9 amino acids) with the amino acid sequence Arg–Pro–Pro–Gly–Phe–Ser–Pro–Phe–Arg.
* Kallidin (KD) is released from LMWK by tissue kallikrein. It is a decapeptide. KD has the same amino acid sequence as Bradykinin with the addition of a Lysine at the N-terminus, thus is sometimes referred to as Lys-Bradykinin.

HMWK and LMWK are formed by alternative splicing of the same gene.

==Enzymes==
* Kallikreins (tissue and plasma kallikrein) are serine proteases that liberate kinins (BK and KD) from the kininogens, which are plasma proteins that are converted into vasoactive peptides. Prekallikrein is the precursor of plasma kallikrein. It can only activate kinins after being activated itself by factor XIIa or other stimuli.
* Carboxypeptidases are present in two forms: N circulates and M is membrane-bound. They remove arginine residues at the carboxy-terminus of BK and KD.
* Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), also termed &quot;kininase II&quot;, inactivates a number of peptide mediators, including bradykinin. It is better known for activating angiotensin.
* Neutral endopeptidase also deactivates kinins and other mediators.

==Pharmacology==
Inhibition of ACE with ACE inhibitors leads to decreased conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) but also to an increase in bradykinin due to decreased degradation. This explains why some patients taking ACE inhibitors develop a dry cough, and some react with angioedema, a dangerous swelling of the head and neck region.

There are hypotheses that many of the ACE-inhibitors&#x27; beneficial effects are due to their influence on the kinin-kallikrein system. This includes their effects in arterial hypertension, in ventricular remodeling (after myocardial infarction) and possibly diabetic nephropathy.

==Role in disease==
Defects of the kinin-kallikrein system in diseases are not generally recognized. The system is the subject of much research due to its relationship to the inflammation and blood pressure systems. It is known that kinins are inflammatory mediators that cause dilation of blood vessels and increased vascular permeability. Kinins are small peptides produced from kininogen by kallikrein and are broken down by kininases. They act on phospholipase and increase arachidonic acid release and thus prostaglandin (PGE2) production.

==C1-INH Involvement==
C1-inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) protein. C1-INH is the most important physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, fXIa and fXIIa. C1-INH also inhibits proteinases of the fibrinolytic, clotting, and kinin pathways. Deficiency of C1-INH permits plasma kallikrein activation, which leads to the production of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin.

<doc id="1100051" wikidata="Q18382" url="?curid=1100051" title="Bra, Piedmont">
<text>Bra (, ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Cuneo in the northwest Italian region of Piedmont. It is situated southeast of Turin and northeast of Cuneo in the area known as Roero.

Bra is the birthplace of the feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero, the politician Emma Bonino, and of the activist Carlo Petrini, founder of the Slow Food movement and of the world&#x27;s first University of Gastronomic Sciences, whose main campus is located within Bra&#x27;s municipal boundaries at Pollenzo. Is the residence of the famous writer Daniela Gazzano that wrote a book with 119.063 eye blink. Bra is also home to &quot;Cheese&quot;, a biennial international festival organised by Slow Food which features the makers of artisanal cheeses from around the world. In 1997 the event attracted some 150,000 visitors. The town is famous for its gastronomy.

Among the structures in town is the intricately domed church of Santa Chiara by the late-Baroque architect, Bernardo Antonio Vittone and the church of St. Andrew, the facade of which was designed by the architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, although not completed until two centuries later.

==Economy==

Bra is notable for the production of Bra sausage, a veal sausage originally made for the Jewish inhabitants of neighbouring Cherasco. It is usually eaten raw.

<text>Arzanene () or Aghdznik () was a historical region in the southwest of the ancient kingdom of Armenia. It was ruled by one of the four (&quot;bidakhsh&quot;, ) of Armenia, the highest ranking nobles below the king who ruled over the kingdom&#x27;s border regions. Its probable capital was the fortress-city of Arzen. The region briefly became home to the capital of Armenia during the reign of Tigranes the Great, who built his namesake city Tigranocerta there. Arzanene was placed under the direct suzerainty of the Roman Empire after the Peace of Nisibis in 298. It was briefly brought back under Armenian control c. 371 but was soon lost again following the partition of Armenia in 387.

== Name ==
It is generally agreed the Greco-Roman name of Arzanene is derived from the city of Arzan ( or in Armenian), which was probably the capital of the province. The name is identified with the &quot;Alzi&quot; or &quot;Alše&quot; mentioned in Neo-Assyrian and Urartian inscriptions and is of non-Armenian origin. 

== Geography ==
Arzanene was located between the western Tigris and the eastern Taurus Mountains, covering an area of approximately . It was located to the east of the Batman River and to the west of the Botan River (both tributaries of the Tigris). The region was naturally divided between the mountainous part closer to the Taurus in the north, which had an extremely cold climate, and the flat part to the south, which had a warm and dry climate. Arzanene was famous for its rivers and springs, as well as its iron and lead mines. Cattle-breeding, grape cultivation and winemaking were well-developed in the province. The province had about seven fortresses. 

According the early medieval Armenian geography &quot;Ashkharhats’oyts’&quot;, Arzanene was divided into ten cantons or &quot;gawars&quot; (their capitals or main fortresses, where known, are listed adjacent to the canton name):
* : (later Martyropolis)
* 
* : 
* 
* : 
* (Sasun): 
One of the recensions of &quot;Ashkharhats’oyts’&quot; includes an eleventh district, , which is likely an error. Historian Suren Yeremian includes Angeghtun among the cantons of Aghdznik’, even though it is not listed as such in any of the manuscripts of &quot;Ashkharhats’oyts’&quot; (Cyril Toumanoff and Robert Hewsen consider Angeghtun to have been a part of Tsop’k’/Sophene).

As the domain of one of the four of Armenia, Arzanene can be divided into the core principality or &quot;Arzanene proper&quot; and the (viceroyalty or march) of Arzanene, which likely included all of the ten cantons of Arzanene listed above (according to Hewsen, probably excluding Np’rkert) and some further territories to the south. Josef Markwart and Toumanoff include the adjacent provinces of Moxoene (Mokk’) and Corduene (or part of it) in the viceroyalty of Arzanene, although this is rejected by Hewsen. The viceroyalty of Arzanene is also called the of Aruastan in some Armenian sources (Persian: , referring in this case to the area around Nisibis), so it is referred to as the Arabian March by some historians.

== History ==
In the first half of the first millennium BCE, Arzanene may have been the location of the state of Alzi or Alše mentioned in Assyrian and Urartian cuneiform inscriptions. It was conquered by the Kingdom of Urartu (c. 9th–6th centuries BCE), then came under the control of the Medes and soon after passed to the Achaemenid Empire. Under Achaemenid rule, Arzanene was included in the Satrapy of Armenia. The Persian Royal Road passed through the province. After the conquest of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE, Arzanene became a part of the Armenian kingdom ruled by the Orontid dynasty. The local princes of Arzanene claimed Assyrian royal origin, but in all likelihood they were originally a branch of the Orontid dynasty. During the reign of Tigranes the Great, under whom Armenia reached its greatest territorial extent, Arzanene became the center of his short-lived empire as the location of the new capital of Tigranocerta. It was probably under Tigranes that the of Arzanene was established to defend Armenia from an invasion from Mesopotamia. The office of the of Arzanene continued to exist under the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia and after the region was lost by Armenia, until at least the mid-5th century.

In 298 AD, the entire of Arzanene came under the suzerainty of the Roman Empire as a result of the Peace of Nisibis. However, the 5th-century Armenian historian Faustus of Byzantium (Book 3, Chapter 8) still speaks of the of Arzanene as a vassal of the king of Armenia in the 330s, which Toumanoff accepts as evidence that the Romans had effectively left Arzanene under Armenian suzerainty. In the 330s, Bakur of Arzanene attempted to defect to the Sasanian Empire, but was killed in battle and the province consequently remained under Roman (or Roman-Armenian) control. The emperor Jovian was forced to give up suzerainty over Arzanene to the Persians according to the peace treaty signed in 363 after Julian&#x27;s failed Persian expedition. Faustus of Byzantium (Book 5, Chapter 16) names Arzanene among the provinces reconquered for Armenia by Mushegh Mamikonian c. 371, during the reign of King Pap. After the Peace of Acilisene of 387, Arzanene was divided between Rome and the Sasanian Empire (with most of it going to the Persians), and until 591 the Roman-Sasanian border passed through the western part of the province. During the Armenian rebellion of 450–451 against the Sasanian Empire, the Armenian rebels appealed to the of Arzanene as a foreign ruler; this is the last time that any of Arzanene is mentioned in the classical sources. By 591, all of Arzanene had been annexed by the Byzantine Empire. On the ruins of Tigranocerta, the Romans built a new city named Martyropolis or Np’rkert. In c. 640, the Arab general Iyad ibn Ghanm invaded Arzanene from Syria. Following the Arab conquest of Armenia, many Arab tribes settled in Arzanene, especially in the lowlands. The Armenian population remained in the mountainous parts of the region until the Armenian genocide in 1915.

Arzanene was later a small Arab emirate under the Zurarid dynasty in the 9th century. In the 10th century the area fell under Hamdanid control. Hamdum, an Arab chief, conquered Arzanene and Amid around 962. In 963 a sister of Hamdum, whose name is not given in the original sources, governed the region for ten years. After 1045 it fell successively under Byzantine, Seljuk, Mongol and Ottoman Turkish control. For many years the Armenians of Sasun maintained a semi-independent status and fought the Ottoman authorities; well known battles are the Sasun Resistance (1894) and Sasun resistance in 1915.

== Population ==
The exact ethnic composition of Arzanene is not known. According to Nicholas Adontz, its population was mixed &quot;Armeno-Syrian.&quot; Pliny the Elder refers to a people called the Azoni, which Robert Hewsen believes to be a misspelling of *Arzoni, apparently referring to the people of Arzanene as if forming a distinct ethnic group. In Hewsen&#x27;s view, Armenians must have settled in Arzanene early on but &quot;it is likely that the basic population had remained essentially semitic-speaking.&quot; Under Arab rule Arzanene became heavily settled by Arab and Kurdish tribes, but a significant Armenian element (according to one source, an absolute majority of Armenians) remained there until the Armenian genocide.

<doc id="1100062" wikidata="Q6141509" url="?curid=1100062" title="USS Redfin">
<text>USS &quot;Redfin&quot; (SS/SSR/AGSS-272), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the redfin, any of several North American fishes with reddish fins.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Redfin&quot; was laid down 16 February 1942 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched on 4 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. B. B. Wygant; and commissioned on 31 August 1943.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====First war patrol, January – March 1944====
Departing New Orleans 15 October 1943, &quot;Redfin&quot; proceeded to Fremantle, Australia. On her first war patrol 4 January to 17 February 1944, she encountered an enemy convoy of four ships in the South China Sea 16 January and damaged the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer . From 8 March to 14 March, she patrolled north of Australia to defend against a possible Japanese attack.

====Second war patrol, March – May 1944====
On her second war patrol 19 March to 1 May, &quot;Redfin&quot; sank the 1,900-ton Japanese destroyer &quot;Akigumo&quot; off Zamboanga, Mindanao, 11 April. During the night of 15 April – 16 April, she sank two Japanese passenger-cargo ships, &quot;Shinyu Maru&quot;, 4,621 tons, and &quot;Yamagata Maru&quot;, 3,807 tons. On the night of 22 April – 23 April, she landed four of her crew near Dent Haven, Borneo, to evacuate a British reconnaissance party. Attacked by the Japanese, the landing party returned to &quot;Redfin&quot;, but the British agents were later evacuated by an Australian officer, and transferred to .

====Third war patrol, May – July 1944====
On her third war patrol, 26 May to 1 July, she landed six Philippine guerrillas on a small island near Balabac Strait 8 June. Proceeding to scout the enemy naval base at Tawi Tawi, she sank the 5,142-ton Japanese tanker &quot;Asanagi Maru&quot; on 11 June. She also warned American forces in the Marianas of the departure from Tawi Tawi of the Japanese task force that was later defeated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 June and 20 June. Operating off Leyte on 24 June, she sank the 3,028-ton Japanese passenger-cargo ship &quot;Aso Maru&quot;, before returning to Fremantle.

====Fourth, fifth, and sixth war patrols, August 1944 – September 1945====
Departing Fremantle 6 August, she laid a minefield off the west coast of Borneo on 19 August and rescued eight survivors of at Palawan Island on 30 August. After lifeguard duty for airstrikes against Balikpapan, Borneo, she departed Fremantle 26 October, and sank the 15,226-ton Japanese tanker &quot;Nichinan Maru No. 2&quot; west of the Philippines 8 November.

Completing her fourth war patrol 7 January 1945, she proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, San Francisco Bay, California, where she received special mine detection gear. Underway from Pearl Harbor 30 May to 10 July, and later from 30 July to 5 September she made mine surveys first off Honshū and Hokkaidō, and later off Kyūshū, Japan.

===Radar picket submarine, 1953–1959===
Decommissioned at New London, Conn., 1 November 1946, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in April 1951 for conversion, and was reclassified SSR-272. Recommissioned 9 January 1953, she engaged in radar picket duty for the next 6 years in American coastal waters, off northern Europe, and in the Mediterranean.

===Auxiliary research submarine, 1959–1967===
In April 1959 she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and received an inertial guidance system. &quot;Redfin&quot; became a laboratory and training ship for the testing of inertial guidance systems used in Polaris submarines. She preceded the first ballistic missile submarine as flagship of Submarine Squadron 14.

After searching for the lost submarine in April 1963, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-272, on 28 June 1963. Operating in the Atlantic, she continued to assist in special research and development projects, including of the Polaris A-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Redfin&quot; decommissioned on 15 May 1967 to become a United States Naval Reserve Training Ship at Baltimore, Maryland. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1970 and sold to the North American Smelting Company of Wilmington, Delaware, on 3 March 1971 for scrapping.

<text>Erlestoke is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, on the northern edge of Salisbury Plain. The village lies about east of Westbury and the same distance southwest of Devizes.

Erlestoke Prison, the only prison in Wiltshire, is within the parish.

==History==
The ancient parish of Erlestoke was a chapelry of Melksham. The Crown was lord of the manor of Erlestoke; the first recorded grant of land was by Henry I in the 12th century. From the 16th until the early 18th the Brouncker family held land at Erlestoke, including Henry Brouncker, a Member of Parliament in the 16th and early 17th. Later owners included Peter Delmé, an 18th-century MP; Joshua Smith (1732–1819), MP for Devizes; and George Watson-Taylor (1771–1841), also MP for Devizes. The Watson-Taylors built up large estates at Erlestoke, Coulston (including Baynton House), Great Cheverell and Edington until they were divided and sold between 1907 and 1910, following the death in 1902 of Simon Watson Taylor; Erlestoke Park remained in the family until it was sold in 1919.

The current form of the village is largely due to Joshua Smith, who between the 1780s and the 1810s was responsible for replacing the Elizabethan manor house with one higher up the hill east of the village, designed by George Steuart. The new house was at first called Stoke Park, and later Erlestoke Park and Erlestoke House. Smith landscaped the park which surrounds the village on three sides, adding a lake, and moving the houses of the village to the current High Street. Newly built estate cottages incorporated pieces of sculpture and architectural fragments from the earlier manor house; an example is Tilted Lodge, c. 1800.
By 1859 there was a school in a building owned by the Watson-Taylors, which formerly served as the laundry for the Erlestoke Park estate. The building was extended in 1893 and came into Church ownership in 1920; children of all ages attended until 1935, when older children were transferred elsewhere. The school closed in 1980 following the building of a new primary school at Great Cheverell.

The Church of the Holy Saviour was built next to the gates of Erlestoke Park in 1880 by G.E. Street for Lady Hannah Watson-Taylor (1818–1887), wife of Simon Watson Taylor. The building has fragments of an earlier church dedicated to St James, possibly from the 12th century; the 16th-century pulpit and five 17th-century bells are also from the earlier church. 18th-century tombs remain in the disused churchyard of the former church, some 150 metres to the northeast.
=== 20th century ===
The Stert and Westbury Railway was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway Company in 1900, providing routes from London to Weymouth or Taunton. There was a station at Lavington, from Erlestoke by road. It was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest railway stations are Pewsey and Westbury.

In the 1930s, the War Office purchased of land in the parish, for accommodation for personnel undergoing training in the area. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map of 1958 shows many small buildings south of the road, opposite Erlestoke House; although the access tracks remain, the buildings are no longer standing.

The Army&#x27;s Senior Officer&#x27;s School moved into Erlestoke House in 1939, and continued in the wings after the central part was seriously damaged by a fire in 1950. Since 1960 the site has been occupied by prison establishments which became HM Prison Erlestoke, with several additional buildings constructed around the house.

==Local government==
Erlestoke has an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.
== Amenities ==
The church is now part of the benefice of Bratton, Edington and Imber, Erlestoke, and Coulston.

The Wessex Ridgeway long-distance footpath crosses Stoke Hill in the south of the parish.

A former walled kitchen garden has been the home of Erlestoke and Coulston Cricket Club since 1991. Erlestoke golf course opened in 1992, west of the village. There was a pub, the &quot;George and Dragon&quot;, in a 17th-century building; it closed in April 2015.

== People ==
Brian Jones, a balloonist who completed the first non-stop flight around the world in 1999, lived in the village around that time. The composer Peter Seabourne lived at Brouncker&#x27;s Court Farm in Erlestoke from 1961 to 1989, studying at Clare College, Cambridge (1980–83) with Robin Holloway. The composer Anthony Scott (pupil of Gerald Finzi and Ralph Vaughan Williams) also lived in the village in the late 1980s, as did the comedians Lenny Henry and Dawn French.

<text>Anita Bitri-Prapaniku (8 January 1968 – 19 October 2004) was a pop singer and violinist from Albania, popular in her native country. Bitri had her first music success at the age of sixteen, and she became popular in Albania with her song &quot;First Love&quot;. She emigrated to the United States in 1996. 

She was found dead in her Staten Island home along with her 8-year-old daughter Sibora Nini and 60-year-old mother Azbije. The three died due to an accidental carbon monoxide poisoning after boiler ventilators in the basement were stuffed with plastic bags to keep out concrete from construction work. Her husband, Luan Prapaniku, had recently died from cancer.

At the time of her death, she was in the process of recording two albums, one in Albanian and one in English.

<text>In Western music, the adjectives major and minor may describe an interval, chord, scale, or key. A composition, movement, section, or phrase may also be referred to by its key, including whether that key is major or minor.

The words derive from Latin words meaning &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small,&quot; and were originally applied to the intervals between notes, which may be larger or smaller depending on how many semitones (half-steps) they contain. Chords and scales are described as major or minor when they contain the corresponding intervals, usually major or minor thirds.

==Intervals==
A major interval is one semitone larger than a minor interval. The words &quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;diminished&quot; and &quot;augmented&quot; are also used to describe the quality of an interval. Only the intervals of a second, third, sixth, and seventh (and the compound intervals based on them) may be major or minor (or, rarely, diminished or augmented). Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves and their compound interval must be perfect (or, rarely, diminished or augmented). In Western music, a minor chord &quot;sounds darker than a major chord&quot;.

== Scales and chords ==

&quot;Major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; may also refer to scales and chords that contain a major third or a minor third, respectively.

* A major scale is a scale in which the third scale degree (the mediant) is a major third above the tonic note. In a minor scale, the third degree is a minor third above the tonic.
* Similarly, in a major triad or major seventh chord, the third is a major third above the chord&#x27;s root. In a minor triad or minor seventh chord, the third is a minor third above the root.

==Keys==
The hallmark that distinguishes major keys from minor is whether the third scale degree is major or minor. Major and minor keys are based on the corresponding scales, and the tonic triad of those keys consist of the corresponding chords; however, a major key can encompass minor chords based on other roots, and vice versa.

As musicologist Roger Kamien explains, &quot;the crucial difference is that in the minor scale there is only a half step between &#x27;2nd and 3rd note&#x27; and between &#x27;5th and 6th note&#x27; as compared to the major scales where the difference between &#x27;3rd and 4th note&#x27; and between &#x27;7th and 8th note&#x27; is [a half step].&quot; This alteration in the third degree &quot;greatly changes&quot; the mood of the music, and &quot;music based on minor scales tends to&quot; be considered to &quot;sound serious or melancholic,&quot; at least to contemporary Western ears.

Minor keys are sometimes said to have a more interesting, possibly darker sound than plain major scales. Harry Partch considers minor as, &quot;the immutable faculty of ratios, which in turn represent an immutable faculty of the human ear.&quot; The minor key and scale are also considered less justifiable than the major, with Paul Hindemith calling it a &quot;clouding&quot; of major, and Moritz Hauptmann calling it a &quot;falsehood of the major&quot;.

Changes of mode, which involve the alteration of the third, and mode mixture are often analyzed as minor changes unless structurally supported because the root and overall key and tonality remain unchanged. This is in contrast with, for instance, transposition. Transposition is done by moving all intervals up or down a certain constant interval, and &quot;does&quot; change the key but not the mode, which requires the alteration of intervals. The use of triads only available in the minor mode, such as the use of A-major in C major, is relatively decorative chromaticism, considered to add color and weaken the sense of key without entirely destroying or losing it.

==Intonation and tuning==
Musical tuning of intervals is expressed by the ratio between the pitches&#x27; frequencies. Simple fractions can sound more harmonious than complex fractions; for instance, an octave is a simple 2:1 ratio and a fifth is the relatively simple 3:2 ratio. The table below gives frequency ratios that are mathematically exact for just intonation, which meantone temperaments seek to approximate.

In just intonation, a minor chord is often (but not exclusively) tuned in the frequency ratio 10:12:15 (). In 12 tone equal temperament at present the most common tuning system in the West) a minor chord has 3 semitones between the root and third, 4 between the third and fifth, and 7 between the root and fifth.

In the perfect fifth (700 cents) is only about two cents narrower than the justly tuned perfect fifth (3:2, or 702.0 cents), but the minor third (300 cents) is noticeably (about 16 cents) narrower than the just minor third (6:5, or 315.6 cents). Moreover, the minor third (300 cents) more closely approximates the 19-limit (Limit) minor third (19:16 or, 297.5 cents, the nineteenth harmonic) with only about a 2 cent error.

A.J. Ellis proposed that the conflict between mathematicians and physicists on one hand and practicing musicians on the other regarding the supposed inferiority of the minor chord and scale to the major may be explained due to physicists&#x27; comparison of just minor and just major triads, in which case minor comes out the loser, versus the musicians&#x27; comparison of the equal tempered triads, in which case minor comes out the winner, since the major third is about 14 cents sharp from the just major third (5:4, or 386.3 cents), but only about 4 cents narrower than the 19 limit major third (24:19, or 404.4 cents); while the minor third closely approximates the 19:16 minor third which many find pleasing.

==Advanced theory==
In the Neo-Riemannian theory, the minor mode is considered the inverse of the major mode, an upside down major scale based on (theoretical) undertones rather than (actual) overtones (harmonics) (See also: Utonality).

The root of the minor triad is thus considered the top of the fifth, which, in the United States, is called the fifth. So in C minor, the tonic is actually G and the leading tone is A (a half step), rather than, in major, the root being C and the leading tone B (a half step). Also, since all chords are analyzed as having a tonic, subdominant, or dominant function, with, for instance, in C, A minor being considered the tonic parallel (tP) (US relative), the use of minor mode root chord progressions in major such as A-major–B-major–C-major is analyzed as sP–dP–T, the minor subdominant parallel (see: parallel chord), the minor dominant parallel, and the major tonic.

<doc id="1100089" wikidata="Q2527012" url="?curid=1100089" title="Tested">
<text>Tested is the first official live album by punk rock band Bad Religion. It was recorded in the USA, Canada, Germany, Estonia, Denmark, Italy and Austria, in 1996, and released in 1997. It is Bad Religion&#x27;s second live album. Instead of using crowd microphones and mobile studios like most live albums, the band tapped the inputs, for a result that portrays Bad Religion&#x27;s live sound without crowd noise. It also includes three new songs; &quot;Dream of Unity,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Reciprocal,&quot; and the title track.

==Background==

Bad Religion&#x27;s US label, Atlantic, turned down releasing &quot;Tested&quot;; however, the band&#x27;s German label, Sony, agreed to release the album in Europe and the rest of the world through its imprints Dragnet and Epic. The album was released in January 1997 in Australia, followed by a European release in February. In March, it was available as import-only in the US.

&quot;Dream of Unity&quot; was released as a single in Germany in 1997.

In 2008, &quot;Tested&quot; was reissued in Europe by Epitaph.

==Critical reception==
Dave Thompson, in &quot;Alternative Rock&quot;, wrote: &quot;Disconcerting the first listen, energizing thereafter, few live albums have been this brave.&quot;

In his review for AllMusic, Jack Rabid called the album &quot;a bit of a letdown.&quot; He felt that the album lacks a &quot;you are there&quot; feel and that the overall sound is &quot;merely average.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Nonetheless, with a band this top-notch, even such a merely passable, perfectly clear recording demonstrates their awesome punk prowess enough (especially that of singer Graffin, whose phenomenal pipes soar all over this) to make &quot;Tested&quot; a large pleasure just the same.&quot; Rabid said of the three new studio tracks: &quot;Dream of Unity&quot; is uncharacteristically half-baked and slightly dull, but both &quot;Tested&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Reciprocal&quot; burn the laser off the player.&quot;

<doc id="1100094" wikidata="Q370559" url="?curid=1100094" title="Branching fraction">
<text>In particle physics and nuclear physics, the branching fraction (or branching ratio) for a decay is the fraction of particles which decay by an individual decay mode or with respect to the total number of particles which decay. It applies to either the radioactive decay of atoms or the decay of elementary particles. It is equal to the ratio of the partial decay constant of the decay mode to the overall decay constant. Sometimes a partial half-life is given, but this term is misleading; due to competing modes, it is not true that half of the particles will decay through a particular decay mode after its partial half-life. The partial half-life is merely an alternate way to specify the partial decay constant , the two being related through:

:formula_1

For example, for decays of Cs, 98.13% are ε (electron capture) or β (positron) decays, and 1.87% are β (electron) decays. The half-life of this isotope is 6.480 days, which corresponds to a total decay constant of 0.1070 d. Then the partial decay constants, as computed from the branching fractions, are 0.1050 d for ε/β decays, and 2.14×10 d for β decays. Their respective partial half-lives are 6.603 d and 347 d.

Isotopes with significant branching of decay modes include copper-64, arsenic-74, rhodium-102, indium-112, iodine-126 and holmium-164.

== Branching fractions of atomic states ==

In the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics, a branching fraction refers to the probability of decay to a specific lower-lying energy states from some excited state. Suppose we drive a transition in an atomic system to an excited state , which can decay into either the ground state or a long-lived state . If the probability to decay (the branching fraction) into the state is , then the probability to decay into the other state would be . Further possible decays would split appropriately, with their probabilities summing to 1.

In some instances, instead of a branching fraction, a branching ratio is used. In this case, the branching ratio is just the ratio of the branching fractions between two states. To use our example from before, if the branching fraction to state is , then the branching ratio comparing the transition rates to and would be .

Branching fractions can be measured in a variety of ways, including time-resolved recording of the atom&#x27;s fluorescence during a series of population transfers in the relevant states.

<text>Audrey Forbes Manley (born March 25, 1934) is an American pediatrician and public health administrator. Manley was the first African-American woman appointed as chief resident at Cook County Children&#x27;s Hospital in Chicago (1962). Manley was the first to achieve the rank of Assistant Surgeon General (Rear Admiral) in 1988 and later served as the eighth president of Spelman College.

==Early life==

Audrey Elaine Manley (née Forbes) was born on March 25, 1934, in Jackson, Mississippi. Her parents, Ora Lee Buckhalter and Jesse Lee Forbes, quickly relocated Manley and her two sisters, Barbara and Yvonne, to Tougaloo, Mississippi, near Tougaloo College. She was the eldest of three daughters in a tenant farming family. Manley was inspired to pursue medicine after the death of her maternal grandmother as well as with the encouragement from her seventh-grade science teacher. During World War II, the Forbes family moved to Chicago after her grandmother could no longer care for her and her siblings.

==Education==

In 1951, Manley graduated as the class valedictorian from Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago. She then attended Spelman College, where she majored in biology, with a double minor in chemistry and mathematics. Manley graduated cum laude from Spelman College in 1955. She then continued her education at Meharry Medical College on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated in 1959. Nearly 30 years later, in 1987, Manley received a master&#x27;s degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University.

==Career==
In 1962, Manley began her medical career and completed her residency in Chicago by being appointed as the first African-American woman to be chief resident as Cook County Children&#x27;s Hospital. During her residency, Manley taught pediatrics at the Cook County School of Nursing. In 1970, Manley moved back to Atlanta after her marriage and began to work at Grady Memorial Hospital&#x27;s Emory University Family Planning Clinic as the Chief of Medical Services. She simultaneously began to serve as &quot;First Lady&quot; for the remainder of her husband&#x27;s tenure as the fifth president of Spelman College and created initiatives such as the Health Career Program. In 1976, Manley was appointed as a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service. Over the next decade, Manley continued her medical pursuits in pediatrics and medical education at a number of institutions, including the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois, Chicago Medical College, Emory University and Howard University. Additionally, Manley studied sickle cell disease and fought for government funding of sickle-cell research.

Beginning in 1989, Manley held a host of government jobs with the U.S. Public Health Service, including becoming the first black woman to serve as principal deputy assistant for public health (1989), member of the U.S. delegation to UNICEF and the UNICEF/WHO Joint Committee on Health Policy (1990-1993), deputy surgeon general (1994), and co-founder acting deputy assistant secretary for minority health. Manley became the first black woman to serve as acting surgeon general of the United States from 1995 to 1997, between the tenures of Joycelyn Elders and J. Jarrett Clinton. During her tenure, Manley focused on emphasizing the importance of physical activity and the health benefits accompanying exercise.

From 1997 to 2002, Manley served as the 8th president of Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. She was the first alumna to be elected president of the college, carrying on the legacy of her husband, Dr. Albert E. Manley, who was the first African American and male president of Spelman College from 1953 to 1976. During her tenure, the college continued to achieve high rankings in multiple areas, including the second-highest producer of black medical students. Additionally, Spelman joined Division II of the NCAA and received a chapter in Phi Beta Kappa.

===Later years===
Though Manley has been retired since 2002, she continues to be involved in the National Merit Scholarship Corporation and the American Academy of Family Physicians.

==Personal life==
During Manley&#x27;s youth, she was well-connected in the black community, attending social events with the likes of Roy Wood and Don Cornelius.

Manley also demonstrated her passion for service with Crossroads Africa where she ran a children&#x27;s ward in a Nigerian hospital. Additionally, she worked in San Francisco to give medical services to children addicted to drugs.

The earliest known encounter between Manley (then Forbes) and her future husband, Albert Manley, occurred while Manley was still a student at Spelman, where she convinced then-president Manley to allow her to take advanced science courses at Morehouse College. The two reconnected when Forbes was chosen as a board of trustees member at Spelman. The couple married in 1970.

==Legacy==
Manley has received awards from the National Council of Negro Women (1979), the United States Public Health Service (1981, 1992), the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (1999) and the Atlanta City Council (2002). Manley has received honorary degrees from Tougaloo College in 1991, and is an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta, Incorporated.
The Albro Falconer Manley Science Center at Spelman College was partly named for Dr. Manley in 2002.

<text>Joseph Riddick &quot;Rick&quot; Hendrick III (born July 12, 1949) is an American businessman. He is best known as the owner of the NASCAR team Hendrick Motorsports. He is also a co-owner of JR Motorsports and founder of the Hendrick Automotive Group, a network of over 100 car dealerships.

As of 2024, his team has won 304 NASCAR Cup Series races, making him the winningest team owner in NASCAR. His team has also won a combined total of 18 NASCAR Championships: 14 in the NASCAR Cup Series (seven by Jimmie Johnson, four by Jeff Gordon, and one each by Chase Elliott, Terry Labonte, and Kyle Larson), three in the NASCAR Truck Series (all by Jack Sprague) and one in the NASCAR Xfinity Series (by Brian Vickers in 2003). He is one of only three owners in history to win NASCAR Championships in the top three series, joining Richard Childress and Jack Roush. Hendrick was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2020.

==Career==
Hendrick began drag racing at age 14 in a self built 1931 Chevrolet. Two years later, at age 16, Hendrick won the Virginia division of the Chrysler-Plymouth Troubleshooting Contest, a two-part test consisting of a written exam and a timed hands-on diagnosis and repair of defects planted on a car.

Afterward, Hendrick opened a small used-car lot with Mike Leith. Leith, an established new-car dealer, was convinced to name Hendrick the general sales manager of the company, at age 23. In 1976, he sold his assets to purchase a franchise in Bennettsville, South Carolina. After doing so, he became the youngest Chevrolet dealer in the United States. Hendrick&#x27;s influence increased sales to make the once troubled location become the region&#x27;s most profitable. The success of Bennettsville was a precursor to the Hendrick Automotive Group, which now has over 100 franchises and 10,000 employees across 13 states. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, his company had a revenue in excess of US$3.5 billion in 2009, after selling 100,000 vehicles and servicing 1.5 million, and is the sixth-largest dealership in the United States. Hendrick is also the chairman of the company.

Hendrick drove in two races during the 1987 and 1988 Winston Cup Series, with finishes of 33rd and 15th, respectively. He also had a single start in both the Busch Series and the Craftsman Truck Series. He also had been a pit crew member for the Flying 11 that Ray Hendrick (no relation) drove in the 1960s. In 1997, Hendrick began the Hendrick Marrow Program, a non-profit works with the Be The Match Foundation to support the National Marrow Donor Program.

==Team owner==
In the late 1970s, Hendrick founded a drag boat racing team that won three consecutive championships, as well as setting a world record of with Nitro Fever. He then moved to the NASCAR Model Sportsman Series (now Xfinity Series), in which he earned one victory with Dale Earnhardt at Charlotte Motor Speedway. In 1984, he founded All-Star Racing (now Hendrick Motorsports). With five full-time employees and of workspace, he fielded one NASCAR Winston Cup team. With Geoff Bodine the driver, his team managed to race in all 30 races to finish ninth in the final standings with three wins and pole positions. Throughout his career as a team owner, Hendrick has won 18 Drivers&#x27; championships (14 Cup Series, 1 Xfinity Series, and 3 Camping World Truck Series), 347 race wins (252 Cup Series, 67 Xfinity Series 23 with Hendrick Motorsports and 44 with JR Motorsports, and 26 Truck Series), and 291 pole positions (216 Sprint Cup Series, 53 Xfinity Series, 36 with Hendrick Motorsports, and 17 JR Motorsports, and 22 Truck Series). He is widely considered to be the most successful team owner in NASCAR history. On December 13, 2018, Hendrick announced that when he retires as owner of Hendrick Motorsports, there are plans in the works for Jeff Gordon to replace him.

During the late 1980s, Hendrick owned the Goodwrench IMSA GTP Corvette driven by Sarel Van der Merwe and Doc Bundy. The car was actually built by Lola but resembled later Corvette models and was powered by GM&#x27;s twin-turbo V-6 engine. The GTP team was based in a tiny shop on Gasoline Alley (formerly Roena Street) in Indianapolis, Indiana and managed by Ken Howes of South Africa. The team experienced mixed successes, setting track records and winning many pole positions but few races. The project was abandoned after only a few seasons.

==Early and personal life==
Hendrick was born in Warrenton, North Carolina and was raised on his family&#x27;s farm in South Hill, Virginia, where he attended Park View High School.

He is the father of the late Ricky Hendrick, a former NASCAR driver, who died in a plane crash in 2004 along with other members of the Hendrick family and Hendrick Motorsports crew members.

On October 31, 2011, Hendrick and his wife, Linda, were involved in a plane crash in Key West, Florida, when the plane landed long at Key West International Airport. Linda suffered minor injuries while Rick suffered three broken ribs and a fractured clavicle.

===Legal issues===
In 1997, Hendrick pleaded guilty to mail fraud. In the 1980s, Honda automobiles were in high demand and Honda executives allegedly solicited bribes from dealers for larger product disbursements. Hendrick admitted to giving hundreds of thousands of dollars, BMW automobiles, and houses to American Honda Motor Company executives. Hendrick was sentenced in December 1997 to a $250,000 fine, 12 months&#x27; home confinement (instead of prison, due to his leukemia), three years probation, and to have no involvement with Hendrick Automotive Group (which was run by Jim Perkins) or Hendrick Motorsports (run by his brother John) during his year of confinement. In December 2000, Hendrick received a full pardon from President Bill Clinton.

<text>James Edmeston (10 September 1791 – 7 January 1867) was an English architect and surveyor; he was also known as a prolific writer of church hymns.

He was born in Wapping, Middlesex, England. His maternal grandfather was the Reverend Samuel Brewer, congregationalist pastor at Stepney Meeting House for 50 years. However, James was attracted to the Church of England and soon became an Anglican.

==Architectural work==
Edmeston began as an architect in 1816. He designed several structures in London, including drinking fountains, the Uzielli memorial in Highgate Cemetery and the church of St Paul&#x27;s, Onslow Square. George Gilbert Scott was his pupil, articled to Edmeston in 1827. In 1864 he built Columbia Wharf, Rotherhithe, the first grain silo in a British port.

==Literary work==
Edmeston started by writing poetry publishing &quot;The Search, and other Poems&quot; in 1817.

==Ecclesiastical and charity career==
He served as the church warden at St. Barnabas in Homerton, Middlesex, and was a strong supporter of and frequent visitor to the London Orphan Asylum. Edmeston is said to have written 2000 hymns, one every Sunday. His best-known hymn is the popular wedding hymn &#x27;Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us / O&#x27;er the world&#x27;s tempestuous sea&#x27;. The hymn has been set to several tunes, one of which, &quot;Mannheim&quot;, is by German composer Friedrich Filitz.

He died in Homerton in 1867.

<doc id="1100116" wikidata="Q4552003" url="?curid=1100116" title="USS Walker (DD-163)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Walker&quot; (DD-163) was a that saw service in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Admiral John Grimes Walker.

==History==
&quot;Walker&quot; was laid down on 19 June 1918 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company under contract from Bethlehem Steel Co. The destroyer was launched on 14 September 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Francis Pickering Thomas. &quot;Walker&quot; was commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 January 1919.

&quot;Walker&quot; got underway on 20 February to rendezvous with the transport as it returned from France with President Woodrow Wilson. Upon completion of this duty, the new destroyer returned to Boston, where she was soon assigned to Division 18, Destroyer Force. She proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, and loaded her full allotment of torpedoes at the Naval Torpedo Station. She sailed for the West Indies on 6 March and, soon after her arrival in the Caribbean fell into the Fleet&#x27;s regular schedule of exercises and maneuvers. &quot;Walker&quot; conducted tactical exercises off San Juan, Puerto Rico, and gunnery exercises out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into the late winter of 1919 and early spring of 1920 before she headed north.

After steaming into New York Harbor on 14 April, the destroyer was sent to her base at Newport. Early the next month, she supported the Navy&#x27;s NC-boat transatlantic flights. Initially stationed at Trepassey Bay from 6 May to 8 May, she later operated at sea from 10 to 17 May, serving as one of the chain of picket ships to provide the NC flying boats with position reports and bearings. When this mission was completed, she returned to Newport on 20 May.

Her next port of call was Annapolis, Maryland, in early June for a two-day visit during Naval Academy graduation exercises, after which &quot;Walker&quot; headed south and transited the Panama Canal on 24 July. She called briefly at Acapulco, Mexico, for two days before steaming for southern California, arriving at Coronado on 8 August.

Based at San Diego, &quot;Walker&quot; conducted local operations off the United States West Coast into late 1920, when she was assigned to the Reserve Destroyer Flotilla. She embarked naval reservists for an indoctrination cruise on 27 October 1920 and remained in &quot;rotating reserve&quot; duty, conducting periodic target practices, full-power runs, and undergoing overhauls at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Decommissioned on 7 June 1922, as part of an austerity program, &quot;Walker&quot; was placed in reserve at San Diego, where she remained into the 1930s.

After 16 years in reserve the ship was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1938 and slated for disposal by sale. Logistics requirements of U.S. West Coast naval districts, however, resulted in the former destroyer being placed back on the list and earmarked for conversion to a water barge. Redesignated YW-57 on 1 April 1939, the ship was undergoing conversion at the Mare Island Navy Yard when the Navy again decided to change the vessel&#x27;s role. With the outbreak of war in Europe and the possibility of American involvement in the conflict, the ship was slated for use as a damage control hulk.

==Fate==
Designated as the damage control hulk &quot;DCH-1&quot; on 11 July 1940, the vessel was based at the Destroyer Base, San Diego, and used for training exercises in formulating and evolving new damage control techniques. In the following year, as the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s base had been moved from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, plans were made to tow &quot;DCH-1&quot; (which had been stripped of propulsion machinery during the initial conversion work to &quot;YW-57&quot;) to the Hawaiian Islands. She was re-designated as IX-44 on 17 February 1941. On 28 December 1941, while being towed from San Diego, California, to Pearl Harbor, by the oiler , &quot;DCH-1&quot; was cast adrift and scuttled by gunfire from &quot;Neches&quot; at .

==Fiction==
USS &quot;Walker&quot; was used in the &quot;Destroyermen&quot; series by Taylor Anderson. In the books, &quot;Walker&quot; and her sister ship are pursued by superior Japanese naval forces after the Battle of the Java Sea and seek refuge in a squall.

<text>The 1964 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1964 season. The 61st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals against the American League champion New York Yankees; the Cardinals prevailed in seven games. St. Louis won their seventh world championship, while the Yankees, who had appeared in 14 of 16 World Series since 1949, did not play in the Series again until .

In an unusual twist, the Yankees fired Yogi Berra after the Series ended, replacing him with Johnny Keane, who had resigned from the Cardinals after the Series. His job had been threatened by Cardinals management, and it was unexpectedly saved by the Cardinals&#x27; dramatic pennant drive.

This is also the most recent World Series that matched the Yankees up against the Cardinals; in the previous four meetings, each team had won twice, with the Yankees winning in 1928 and 1943, and the Cardinals in 1926 and 1942. This was the first World Series to feature a team with the players&#x27; last names on the uniforms (St. Louis).

This pennant for the Yankees concluded their remarkable run of 15 World Series appearances over 18 years. In total, they won 29 American League championships in the 44-year span from 1921 through 1964.

==Background==
The 1964 World Series, and the season leading up to it, later became the subject for the David Halberstam &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller &quot;October 1964&quot;. The Series is seen as a bellwether point in baseball history as it was the last hurrah for the 1950s Yankee Dynasty of Mantle, Maris, Ford and Berra, among others, and it demonstrated that the National League&#x27;s growing enthusiasm to sign black and Latino players (such as those of the &#x27;64 Cardinals) was a permanent paradigm shift in fielding a championship team.

The Series featured the brother-against-brother match-up of Ken Boyer of the Cardinals and Clete Boyer of the Yankees, both of whom started at third base for their respective teams.

For the first time in Series history, all six umpires rotated through their positions. In all Series from 1947 through 1963, only the four infield umpires had rotated, with the last two umpires working only in the outfield throughout the Series.

Mickey Mantle, playing in his last Series, hit three home runs, raising his total to a record-setting 18, surpassing Babe Ruth&#x27;s mark of 15.

Utility infielder Chet Trail, who had no prior major league experience, appeared on the Yankees&#x27; World Series roster to fill the opening created by an injury to Tony Kubek. Trail did not play in the series (Phil Linz played in place of Kubek), and Trail never appeared in a major league game during his career.

Both Berra and Keane were St. Louis natives, though neither had ever played for the hometown Cardinals; Berra&#x27;s entire playing career was spent in New York, while Keane played in the Cardinals&#x27; farm system but never reached the major leagues as a player.

===Yankees===
After winning the American League pennant in 1963, the Yankees faced strong challenges from the pitching-rich Chicago White Sox and up-and-coming Baltimore Orioles in 1964. On August 22, the Yankees were in third place, games out of first. Led by recently called up pitcher Mel Stottlemyre (who went 9–3), and helped by the post trade deadline acquisition of relief pitcher Pedro Ramos (2–0 with seven saves for New York) from Cleveland, the Yankees went 27–8 to take a game lead with five to play. After losing two games in Detroit, the Yankees clinched the pennant on the next-to-last day of the season with an 8–3 win over the Indians.

===Cardinals===
The Cardinals were coming off a second-place finish in 1963, and their road to the World Series was even more dramatic than that of the Yankees. After a season-long four-way race among the Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Cincinnati Reds, the Phillies appeared to have the pennant in hand as they built a game lead with 12 games to play. But they proceeded to lose 10 straight games. With two games remaining, four teams still had a mathematical chance to win the pennant. The Giants were the first to be eliminated when they lost on October 3 to the Cubs, 10–7. The Cardinals lost to the lowly Mets, 15–5, while the Phillies ended their 10-game losing streak with a 4–3 win over the Reds. Going into the last day of the season, the Cardinals and Reds were tied for first and the Phillies were one game back; the Phillies hoped to force the first three-way tie in major league history by defeating the Reds and hoping the Mets would beat the Cardinals. The Phillies did their part by defeating the Reds, 10–0, but the Cardinals overcame an early 3–2 deficit and beat the Mets, 11–5, to win the pennant.

During the season the Cardinals would be involved in the Lou Brock-for-Ernie Broglio trade, later considered one of the more lopsided trades in baseball history.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


The Cardinals&#x27; scouting report indicated that injuries had taken their toll on Mickey Mantle&#x27;s defense and that he could be run on. They acted on this intelligence, taking extra bases repeatedly and scoring from second on singles in the second and sixth innings. The Cardinals also believed that they should swing early in the count against Whitey Ford, and this strategy also paid off, as Ray Sadecki, Carl Warwick, and Mike Shannon all drove in runs on the first or second pitches of their at-bats.

The Cardinals struck first in the bottom of the first off Whitey Ford on Ken Boyer&#x27;s sacrifice fly after two one-out singles, but Tom Tresh&#x27;s two-run home run after a single off Ray Sadecki put the Yankees up 2–1 in the second. They made it 3–1 when Clete Boyer singled, stole second, and scored on Ford&#x27;s single. The Cardinals cut the lead to 3–2 in the bottom of the inning when Mike Shannon hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Sadecki&#x27;s single. Tresh&#x27;s RBI double in the fifth after two two-out singles made it 4–2 Yankees, but the Cardinals sent eight men to the plate in the sixth inning. Shannon&#x27;s home run after a single tied the game, then after Tim McCarver doubled, Al Downing relieved Ford and allowed a two-out RBI single to Carl Warwick and a single to Curt Flood to put the Cardinals up 6–4. The Yankees cut the lead to one in the eighth when Johnny Blanchard doubled and scored on Bobby Richardson&#x27;s single off Barney Schultz, but the Cardinals padded their lead in the bottom half, loading the bases off Rollie Sheldon on two walks and an error, then Flood&#x27;s RBI single and Lou Brock&#x27;s two-run double off Pete Mikkelsen put them up 9–5. Schultz retired the Yankees in order in the ninth for the save. Ford pitched with severe pain and numbness in his arm for much of the 1964 season, and that day he was again in pain and missing with sliders inside. Shannon came up looking for sliders and hit one 500 feet. This was the last World Series appearance by Ford, whose shoulder had been injured during the season. Ford had pitched in 22 World Series games with the Yankees, compiling ten victories, going back to the sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1950, and set a record which still stands by pitching consecutive scoreless innings across three different World Series (1960–62).

===Game 2===


Rookie Mel Stottlemyre, called up from the minors in August, dominated for New York and the Cardinal bullpen wilted in the late innings. The Cardinals struck first in the third on Curt Flood&#x27;s groundout with runners on second and third, but the Yankees tied the game in the fourth on Clete Boyer&#x27;s bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Bob Gibson. After a walk and hit-by-pitch in the sixth, Tom Tresh&#x27;s RBI single put the Yankees up 2–1. Next inning, Phil Linz hit a leadoff single, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on Bobby Richardson&#x27;s single. After moving to third on a single, Richardson scored on Mickey Mantle&#x27;s groundout. Lou Brock&#x27;s groundout in the eighth with runners on second and third shaved the lead to 4–2, but the Yankees blew the game open in the ninth. Linz&#x27;s leadoff home run off Barney Schultz made it 5–2 Yankees. After a one-out single, Gordie Richardson relieved Schultz and allowed an RBI double to Mantle. After an intentional walk, Joe Pepitone&#x27;s RBI single and Tresh&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 8–2 Yankees. The Cardinals got a run in the bottom half when Dick Groat hit a leadoff triple and scored on Tim McCarver&#x27;s single, but Stottlemyre retired the next two hitters to end the game as the Yankees&#x27; 8–3 win tied the series heading to New York.

===Game 3===


Curt Simmons and Jim Bouton were both very effective. Simmons got 17 ground-ball outs. The Yankees scored a run in the second on Clete Boyer&#x27;s RBI double with two on, but Simmons&#x27;s RBI single tied the game in the fifth. Bouton stranded the go-ahead run four times and held the top five hitters in the Cardinal lineup to a 2 for 21 day.

In the bottom of the ninth, Mickey Mantle reached deep for one of the last ounces of Yankees magic. With the game tied at one, Mantle, the leadoff hitter, told on-deck hitter Elston Howard to go back to the clubhouse because he was going to hit a home run. Mantle swung at the first pitch from Barney Schultz, a knuckleball that failed to move, and hit it into the right field stands to win the game for the Yankees. Schultz had been a mainstay of the Cardinals&#x27; stretch run and Yankee scouting reports had advised that his knuckler was most vulnerable on the first pitch when he threw harder than usual to try for a strike. Mantle&#x27;s home run (his 16th Series home run) broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s record for most home runs hit in World Series play.

===Game 4===


Cardinal starting pitcher Ray Sadecki let the first four Yankees hit safely. After a leadoff double by Phil Linz, Bobby Richardson&#x27;s RBI double put the Yankees up 1–0. After a single, Mickey Mantle&#x27;s RBI single made it 2–0 and Sadecki was promptly removed by manager Keane. Roger Craig came in to pitch and gave up an RBI single to Elston Howard but allowed no more damage. After five innings, New York was still up 3–0 and St. Louis had only one hit off Downing.

The turning point of the game — and the Series — came in the top of the sixth. Carl Warwick led off with his third pinch-hit base hit, tying a World Series record. Curt Flood singled to put runners on first and second. After Lou Brock flied out, Dick Groat reached base on a slow roller that was bobbled by Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson. Instead of runners on second and third with two out, the bases were loaded with one out.

In the first game, Yankee Al Downing struck Cardinal Ken Boyer out with a high changeup. Downing faced Boyer again with the bases loaded, and Boyer guessed that he&#x27;d see the high changeup again. He guessed right, and hit a grand-slam. Ron Taylor relieved Craig and gave up one hit over the last four innings. St. Louis won the game 4–3; instead of trailing three games to one, Boyer&#x27;s grand slam enabled the Cardinals to even the Series at two games apiece and guaranteed a return to St. Louis.

===Game 5===


The game was scoreless in the top of the fifth inning when the Cardinals plated two. Pitcher Bob Gibson led off the inning with a single. Center fielder Curt Flood hit a grounder to second base that Bobby Richardson fumbled. Instead of a potential double play, the Cardinals had two runners on. Lou Brock, hitless in his previous 14 at bats, singled in Gibson. Flood scored on a Bill White ground out after Phil Linz made another misplay, throwing a ball into the dirt at first on what should have been the back end of a double play.

The Yankees were still down 2–0 when they rallied in the ninth inning. Mantle reached base on an error by Dick Groat. With one out and one on, Joe Pepitone smashed a bouncer off Bob Gibson&#x27;s leg, the ball ricocheting towards the third-base line. Gibson recovered quickly and threw to first, and the Cardinals were one out away. With two out, though, Tom Tresh crushed a long drive into the right center field bleachers and the game was tied. The game went to extra innings, and it was the Cardinals who seized the initiative. With two on and one out and lefty hitter Tim McCarver up, Berra stuck with right-hander Pete Mikkelsen rather than using lefty specialist Steve Hamilton. McCarver delivered a three-run home run in the tenth inning to send the Cardinals back to St. Louis with a 3–2 lead in the series. Just 22 years old at the time, McCarver would go 11–for–23 (.478) in the series. For his entire career McCarver would hit .271. This was the last postseason game at Yankee Stadium before its renovation following the 1973 season. This was also the Cardinals last road win against the Yankees until August 31, 2024.

===Game 6===


The Cardinals struck first in Game 6 on Bill White&#x27;s double play with runners on first and third in the first off Jim Bouton, but the Yankees tied the score in the fifth when Tom Tresh hit a leadoff double and scored on Bouton&#x27;s two-out single off Curt Simmons. Back-to-back home runs by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle put the Yankees up 3–1 in the sixth before they blew the game open in the eighth. With two on and two outs off Barney Schultz, Elston Howard&#x27;s RBI single made it 4–1 Yankees. After a walk loaded the bases, Gordie Richardson relieved Schultz and allowed a grand slam to Joe Pepitone to put the Yankees up 8–1. The Cardinals scored a run in the bottom of the inning on Bill White&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third and no out, then in the ninth, Bob Skinner hit an RBI single with two on off Steve Hamilton (the run charged to Bouton) before Curt Flood hit into the game-ending double play. The Yankees&#x27; 8–3 win forced a deciding Game 7.

===Game 7===


&quot;Something had to give&quot; in Game 7, as the Yankees had lost back-to-back World Series only once (to the New York Giants in 1921–22), and were in danger of doing so again, having lost to the Dodgers in 1963; and the Cardinals had never lost a World Series Game 7.

Bob Gibson pitched his third start in this Series on two days rest. He was tired but deliberately worked fast to hide his fatigue from the Yankees. In the bottom of the fourth the Cardinals scored three times. Again the Yankees botched a double play when Linz&#x27;s throw to first went wide, and Bill White scored. McCarver then scored from third on a double steal. Al Downing came in for the fifth after Stottlemyre developed shoulder stiffness, and Lou Brock hit his first pitch for a home run. Two more runs made it 6–0.

Mantle cut the gap in half with a three-run homer in the sixth, adding to his own record for total home runs in the World Series. Ken Boyer responded with a home run in the seventh that pushed the lead to 7–3. Bobby Richardson broke a World Series hit record in the seventh with his 13th hit, later tied by Brock in 1968 and Marty Barrett in 1986. Gibson continued to tire, but manager Keane left him in. Ken Boyer&#x27;s brother Clete hit a home run for New York with one out in the ninth, making the score 7–4. Pinch-hitter Johnny Blanchard struck out. Linz hit another home run, pulling New York to within two, 7–5, but the next batter, Richardson, popped up to second baseman Dal Maxvill and the Cardinals won the Series.

Bob Gibson won the Series MVP award for his 2–1 record, 3.00 ERA, and 31 strikeouts in 27 innings pitched. Jim Bouton, pitching for the Yankees, started two games and won them both, compiling a 1.56 Series ERA. Six years later, he would write the classic baseball memoir, &quot;Ball Four&quot;. After the series, the Yankees fired manager Yogi Berra and replaced him with the Cardinal manager, Keane, who quit St. Louis due to his differences with Cardinal owner Gussie Busch. Yogi Berra would go on to join the New York Mets, the following season and be re-united with Casey Stengel as a player/coach.

Tim McCarver (who finished second in MVP voting to Gibson) batted .478 in the series and recorded 11 hits, 5 RBIs and a home run and scored 4 runs.

The 1964 Cardinals were the only team between 1962 and 1972 to win the World Series when owning home-field advantage.

Game 7 was the last postseason game to be played at the first Busch Stadium, and the last such game to be played in St. Louis until 1967 (at Busch Memorial Stadium, which opened during the previous season), when the Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox to win their next world championship. The first non-World Series postseason games to be played in St. Louis occurred in 1982, when the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves in the NLCS and the then-American League Milwaukee Brewers in the World Series. The Cardinals also ended their first season at the current Busch Stadium with a World Series win over the Detroit Tigers in ; the Yankees (then in their first season at the current Yankee Stadium) did the same thing in by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in that year&#x27;s World Series.

==Aftermath==
After appearing in 15 World Series (winning ten) in the 18 seasons from 1947 to 1964, the Yankees went into decline as many of their stars either moved on to other teams or retired. They did not reach the World Series again until , when they were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in four games, and next won a World Series in , when they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.

<text>Wazirabad (Urdu/) is a city in Punjab, Pakistan. It is the administrative capital of Wazirabad District (formerly a Tehsil of Gujranwala District).

Famous for its cutlery products, it is known as the city of cutlery and is also quite famous for its foods.

Wazirabad is situated on the banks of the Chenab River nearly 100 kilometres north of Lahore on the Grand Trunk Road. It is 45 kilometres from Sialkot, 30 kilometres from Gujranwala, and about 12 kilometres from Gujrat. The city of Wazirabad is the headquarters of former Wazirabad Tehsil (now called Wazirabad District in 2023), an administrative subdivision of the district, the city itself is subdivided into 12 Union Councils.

==History==
The city was founded by Wazir Khan, the governor and later Grand Vizier of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, in the 17th century. The town was taken over by Charat Singh around 1760, together with other towns in the district. Maharaja Ranjit Singh occupied the town in 1809, and Avitabile was appointed as the Nazim of the city. In 1855, Jarral Rajputs of Rajouri&#x27;s own Saman Burj Wazirabad ruled Wazirabad. He built an entirely new town, with a straight, broad bazaar running through it and side streets at right angles.

===British rule===
During British rule, Wazirabad was the headquarters of the old Wazirabad District, broken up in 1851-2, and was the site of a military cantonment moved to Sialkot in 1855.

The municipality was created in 1867; the population, according to the 1901 census, was 18,069. The income during the ten years ending 1902-3 averaged Rs. 20,800, and the expenditure Rs. 21,400. In 1903-04, the income was Rs. 20,800, chiefly from octroi, and the expenditure was Rs. 19,200. The town had a considerable trade in timber, which comes down the Chenab from Jammu territory. The smiths of Wazirabad had a reputation for the manufacture of small articles of cutlery, and the town of Nizamabad within a mile of the town is famed for its weapons. Wazirabad was an important junction on the North-Western Railway, as the Sialkot-Jammu and Lyallpur lines both branch off of here.

The Chenab river is spanned opposite Wazirabad by the Alexandra railway bridge, one of the finest engineering works of the kind in India, which was opened in 1876 by Edward VII the King-Emperor when he was Prince of Wales. The town possessed two Anglo-Vernacular high schools, one maintained by the Church of Scotland Mission, and a government dispensary.

On 1 July 1919, &quot;Crosby&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Fleet, and a week later she sailed from New York for San Diego, arriving on 7 August. She visited Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, then was placed in reserve status with reduced complement at San Diego on 30 January 1920. She continued in reserve and was decommissioned on 7 June 1922.

===World War II===
Recommissioned on 18 December 1939, &quot;Crosby&quot; sailed on Neutrality Patrol out of San Pedro on 1 April 1940. On 3 April she collided with, and sank, the fishing vessel &quot;Lone Eagle&quot; off Point Arguello, California. On 1 July 1940, she was assigned to the 11th Naval District Defense Forces, and after a reserve training cruise resumed her patrols and provided services to Destroyer Base, San Diego for the training of destroyer crews.

With the entry of the United States into the war, &quot;Crosby&quot; continued to patrol the waters of the 11th Naval District and to escort convoys locally until 1 February 1943 when she entered Mare Island Navy Yard for conversion to a high-speed transport. She was reclassified APD-17 on 22 February 1943.

Clearing San Francisco on 27 February 1943, &quot;Crosby&quot; sailed by way of Pearl Harbor, Samoa, Viti Levu, and Noumea to Espiritu Santo, arriving on 27 March for training exercises with the 4th Marines. Beginning the active service which was to bring her a Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Crosby&quot; sailed on 29 April for Guadalcanal as a transport screen. She made two similar voyages until 6 June, and then reported for patrol and escort duty in the Solomons. &quot;Crosby&quot; aided in the consolidation of the Solomons, landing troops on New Georgia between 30 June and 5 July; on the Treasury Islands under heavy gunfire on 27 October; and on Bougainville on 6 and 17 November. She sailed on 21 November for at Brisbane, Australia, returning to Milne Bay, New Guinea on 12 December. She trained Army and Marine personnel in amphibious landings, then landed troops at Cape Gloucester, New Britain, between 24 and 29 December 1943 and at Dekays Bay, New Guinea on 2 January 1944.

Clearing Milne Bay on 6 January 1944, &quot;Crosby&quot; escorted convoys from Espiritu Santo to the Solomon Islands through January, remaining in the Solomons on antisubmarine patrol and screening duty. She landed troops on Green Island from 15 to 20 February and on Emirau Island on 20 March. Returning to the New Guinea operations on 6 April, she landed troops at Aitape on 22 and 26 April; escorted convoys to Hollandia; participated in the invasion of Biak Island on 27 May; and served as flagship for landing craft in Humboldt Bay from 31 May to 6 July. Following a brief overhaul at Manus, she landed troops on Cape Sansapor on 30 July, then sailed to Sydney, Australia, for replenishment and repairs. She returned to Humboldt Bay on 30 August and landed troops on Morotai on 15 September to complete her operations in the New Guinea area.

&quot;Crosby&quot; put out from Humboldt Bay on 12 October 1944 and put men of the 6th Rangers ashore on Suluan Island, Leyte on 17 October, for a reconnaissance mission. In preparation for the invasion landings, she landed troops on Dinagat Island, at the opening of Leyte Gulf on 19 and 20 October. Reloading troops at Humboldt Bay, she landed them in Ormoc Bay on 7 December. She recovered the survivors of which was sunk by American gunfire after severe damage from Japanese &quot;kamikazes&quot;. &quot;Crosby&quot; participated in the landings on Mindoro 15 December and again returned to Humboldt Bay for additional men. After landing her troops at Lingayen Gulf on 11 January 1945, &quot;Crosby&quot; continued to support the Luzon landings, landing men successfully at Nasugbu on 31 January; Mariveles on 15 February; and Corregidor on 17 February. On 25 February she cleared for Ulithi and an overhaul.

&quot;Crosby&quot; arrived at Okinawa on 18 April and for antisubmarine patrol and radar picket duty, narrowly escaping damage from a &quot;kamikaze&quot; on 13 May. She stood out for San Francisco 18 May and arrived 19 June. Overage and badly battered from her long and strenuous service, it was considered unfeasible to repair her. &quot;Crosby&quot; was decommissioned 28 September 1945 and sold 23 May 1946, to Boston Metals Co., Baltimore Maryland.

==Awards==
In addition to her Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Crosby&quot; earned 10 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="1100159" wikidata="Q33916" url="?curid=1100159" title="Suba language">
<text>Kisuba, also known as Olusuba, is a Bantu language spoken by the Suba people of Kenya. The language features an extensive noun-classification system using prefixes that address gender and number. Suba clans are located on the eastern shore and islands of Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania. They have formed alliances with neighboring clans, such as the Luo people, via intermarriages, and as a result a majority of Suba people are bilingual in Dholuo. The Suba religion has an ancient polytheistic history that includes writings of diverse, ancestral spirits. A recent revival of the Suba language and its culture has influenced the increasing number of native speakers each year.

== History ==
Suba is an African language spoken by the Sub-Saharan people on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria. Trade dependence was established in the mid-19th century between the Suba people and the Luo, a larger neighboring clan. After a period of interaction, both clans became accustomed to each other&#x27;s traditions and practices. Eventually, through factors such as intermarriage, education, and religion, both clans would combine and become known as the Luo-Suba. With Luo being the larger population, the alliance would decrease the demand for people to speak Suba, and in consequence, decreasing the number of native Suban speakers. Most Suban speakers became bilingual in both Suba and Luo. In the mid-1990s, a revival of the Suba language occurred after the Kenyan government initiated the Suba language project, where Suba was introduced as a subject in Kenyan primary schools. In addition, many written examples of the Suban language have been studied through ancient Suban religious texts. These texts depict a detailed polytheistic religion that describes spirits of ancient ancestors as protectors of family and land. Presently, Christianity is the major religion practiced by the Suban people, where in 2010, the New Testament was translated into Suba.

== Geographical distribution ==
The Suba language and its native speakers are located on the African eastern shores of Lake Victoria, populating both Kenya and Tanzania. Additionally, Suban natives are located on various islands within Lake Victoria.
== Grammar ==
Suban grammar and its characteristics are similar to other Bantu languages.

=== Phonology ===
Suba, being a Bantu language, consists of a Bantu phonology typical of other Bantu languages. In general, Suba consists of 11 consonants and 7 vowels. Constants only occur at the beginning of syllables, creating a syllable structure of V or CV. Syllables can begin with vowels but always need to end in them. Suban syllables also consist of two different tones, low and high. A high tone is marked with an acute accent (´), and a low is marked with a grave accent (`) or not marked at all. Low tones are more common in the Suban language.

=== Morphology/syntax ===
Its extensive noun classification system uses prefixing to mark gender and number, in turn determining whether the noun is singular or plural.

An important characteristic of Suban word structure is its ability to change number and meanings of words through minor changes to their words&#x27; prefixes. The prefix of a noun denotes the noun class and number to a noun, making a noun without a prefix meaningless. Most Bantu noun classification systems contain 22 noun classes, accommodating singular and plural forms as two separate noun classes. Instead, Suba contains ten noun classes by combining singular and plural forms into the same noun classes. Similarities in nominal and pronominal prefixes determine what noun belongs to what noun class. By establishing a smaller noun class, the Suba language can use a less extensive prefixing system to change the meaning and plurality of words. In addition, the meaning of the root noun can fluctuate depending on the prefix used, specifically seen in pronouns. The usual word order for the Suba language is SVO, similar to English and other Bantu languages. Adjectives and number roots must agree in noun class and number with the nouns they act on.

== Writing system ==
The Suba writing system is based on the Latin script. The use of Latin script has made it easier for Suban people to practice Christianity and translate verses of biblical texts. The Suba numeral system also has Latin descent as it uses lower order to establish higher order. With Suba being one of the marginalized Bantu languages of Kenya, much more description of the language still needs to be studied.

<text>The Chenab River is a major river in South Asia, flowing through India and Pakistan, and is one of the 5 major rivers of the Punjab region. It is formed by the union of two headwaters, the Chandra and Bhaga, which rise in the upper Himalayas in the Lahaul region of Himachal Pradesh, India. The Chenab flows through the Jammu region of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, into the plains of Punjab, Pakistan, where it joins the Sutlej River to form the Panjnad, which ultimately flows into the Indus River at Mithankot.

The waters of the Chenab were allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is allowed non-consumptive uses such as power generation. The Chenab River is extensively used in Pakistan for irrigation. Its waters are also transferred to the channel of the Ravi River via numerous link canals.

== Name ==
The Chenab river was called &#x27; () in the Rigveda (VIII.20.25, X.75.5). The name meant that it was seen to have dark-coloured waters. The term Krishana is also found in the Atharvaveda. A later form of Askikni was &#x27; () and the Greek form was – &quot;Akesínes&quot;; Latinized to &quot;Acesines&quot;.

In the Mahabharata, the common name of the river was &quot;Chandrabhaga&quot; () because the river is formed from the confluence of the Chandra and the Bhaga rivers. This name was also known to the Ancient Greeks, who Hellenised it in various forms such as &quot;Sandrophagos&quot;, &quot;Sandabaga&quot; and &quot;Cantabra&quot;.

The simplification of Chandrabhaga to &#x27;Chenab&#x27;, with evident Persianate influence, probably occurred in early medieval times and is witnessed in Alberuni.

== Course ==

The river is formed by the confluence of two rivers, Chandra and Bhaga, at Tandi, southwest of Keylong, in the Lahaul and Spiti district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

The Bhaga river originates from Surya taal lake, which is situated a few kilometers west of the Bara-lacha la pass in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandra river originates from glaciers east of the same pass (near Chandra Taal). This pass also acts as a water-divide between these two rivers. The Chandra river transverses while the Bhaga river transverses through narrow gorges before their confluence at Tandi.

The Chandra-Bhaga then flows through the pangi valley of Chamba district in Himachal Pradesh before entering the Jammu division of Jammu and Kashmir, where it flows through the Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban, Reasi and Jammu districts. It enters Pakistan and flows through the Punjab province before emptying into the Sutlej, forming the Panjnad river.

== History ==
The river was known to Indians in the Vedic period. In 325 BCE, Alexander the Great allegedly founded the town of Alexandria on the Indus (present-day Uch Sharif or Mithankot or Chacharan in Pakistan) at the confluence of the Indus and the combined streams of Punjab rivers (currently known as the Panjnad River). Arrian, in the Anabasis of Alexander, quotes the eyewitness Ptolemy Lagides as writing that the river was 2 miles wide where Alexander crossed it.

The Battle of Chenab was fought between Sikhs and Afghans on the bank of the river.

==Dams==

The river has rich power generation potential in India. There are many dams built, under construction or proposed to be built on the Chenab for the purpose of hydroelectric power generation in the country, including:
All of these are &quot;run-of-the-river&quot; projects as per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. The Treaty allocates the waters of Chenab to Pakistan. India can use its water for domestic and agricultural uses or for &quot;non-consumptive&quot; uses such as hydropower. India is entitled to store up to of water in its projects. The three projects completed , Salal, Baglihar and Dul Hasti, have a combined storage capacity of .
Pakistan has four headworks on the Chenab:

<doc id="1100175" wikidata="Q1451078" url="?curid=1100175" title="Francisco Rolão Preto">
<text>Francisco de Barcelos Rolão Preto, (12 February 1893, Gavião – 18 December 1977, Hospital do Desterro, Lisbon) was a Portuguese politician, journalist, and leader of the Portuguese National Syndicalists Movement (MNS), a fascist organization. When in 1934 Salazar decided to ban the National Syndicalist Movement, Preto was briefly detained and later exiled. While in exiled and in Madrid, he was a guest in the house of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, with whom he collaborated in formulating a program for the Falange. In the eve of the Second World War he published a new editions of his work on Italian Fascism with high hopes on the Berlin-Rome axis. After World War II, Rolão Preto abandoned fascism and joined the left-wing forum Movement of Democratic Unity. In 1949 he participated in General Norton de Matos’s 1949 presidential election campaign. He also backed more liberal candidates for the Presidency, such as Quintão Meireles, Francisco Higino Craveiro Lopes, and, ultimately, had a particularly important role (campaign press manager) in the 1958 campaign of another Salazar&#x27;s opponent, General Humberto Delgado.

After the Revolution of April 25, with Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles, Henrique Barrilaro Ruas, João Camossa de Saldanha, Augusto Ferreira do Amaral, Luís Coimbra, among others, he founded the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party.

In 1994, the Portuguese President Mário Soares granted him, posthumously, the Great Cross of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator.

==The national syndicalists==

The national syndicalists, also called the &quot;Blue Shirts&quot; (&quot;camisas azuis&quot;), following the tradition of uniformed right-wing paramilitary groups, was an organisation advocating syndicalism and unionism, inspired by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s brand of Italian fascism. As Rolão Preto wrote in July 1922, &quot;our organic syndicalism is essentially the basis of current syndicalist thought among Mussolini’s friends&quot;. MNS was also built on previous allegiances to &quot;Integralismo Lusitano&quot;, but it was not inspired by the &quot;Action Française&quot; as alleged by their adversaries.

He advocated especially the personalism of Emmanuel Mounier and some of the aspects of unionism. His unionist platform was based on leftist ideas of social justice, such as &quot;a minimum family wage&quot;, &quot;paid holidays&quot;, &quot;working class education&quot;, and a world in which workers are &quot;guaranteed the right to happiness&quot;.

==Early life==

Cutting short his lyceum studies, Rolão Preto left for Galicia in Spain, where he joined the monarchist army officer, Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, in his 1911–1912 failed attempts to topple the Portuguese First Republic. He then left for Belgium and worked for the integralist magazine, &quot;Alma Portuguesa&quot;, while completing secondary studies at the &quot;Liceu português&quot; in Louvain and then attending the Université Catholique there.

Rolão Preto had to flee Belgium when World War I began, and he took refuge in France; he finished his studies at the University of Toulouse, where he earned a degree in law before returning to Portugal. He replaced the jailed Hipólito Raposo as editor of the journal, &quot;A Monarquia&quot;. A member of the &quot;Junta Central de Integralismo Lusitano&quot; from 1922 onward, he began a close collaboration with the President of Portugal, Gomes da Costa, even before the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état which established the Ditadura Nacional, and edited the &quot;12 points&quot; the coup leaders published in Braga.

==Against Salazar&#x27;s regime==

In 1930, he approached David Neto and other &quot;sidonista&quot; (conservatives, initially members of the Partido Republicano Nacionalista), with whom he created the &quot;Liga Nacional 28 de maio&quot;, self-proclaimed defender of the &quot;national revolution&quot;. Rolão Preto gained notoriety as an advocate of national syndicalism and as editor of the &quot;Diário Académico Nacionalista da Tarde&quot;, first published in 1932, which soon changed its name to the &quot;Diário Nacional-Sindicalista da Tarde&quot;. He founded the Blue Shirts, which used the Order of Christ Cross, displayed the Roman salute, and became very popular in universities and among the youngest officers of the Portuguese Army.

The Preto personality cult grew in 1933 as the movement took to the streets and Preto engaged himself in a national propaganda tour. Preto became a regular presence at Italian Embassy receptions. The movement’s newspapers began to call Preto the Chief (Chefe), and internal party correspondence reveals that he was revered by his followers. Delegation from the Italian National Fascist Party and German Nazi Party became regularly attended at the rallies of Preto´s movement. In the summer of 1933, the Civil Governors were instructed to prohibit public National Syndicalist demonstrations but Preto&#x27;s followers managed to organize demonstrations, hiring a tugboat to greet the Italian Fascist leader Italo Balbo when he visited Lisbon. Preto also started to organize militias (Shock Brigades). According to Police reports the Lisbon Brigade, known as the Black Brigade (Brigada Negra), composed of about 60 men, became quite active on the streets.

After a long meeting with the chief of the political police, Salazar decided to dissolve the National Syndicalist Movement. On 4 July 1934 Preto was briefly detained and later exiled as part of purge of the leadership of the National Syndicalist Movement. Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as &quot;inspired by certain foreign models&quot; and their &quot;exaltation of youth, and the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader&quot; as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the New State. The British Embassy informed London with some satisfaction stating that the Portuguese National Syndicalist Movement took &quot;its inspiration from the Italian Embassy&quot; and described Preto as a &quot;vain man with a strong sense of intrigue&quot;.

Preto ended up opposing the Salazar&#x27;s regime for being too moderate and due to Salazar&#x27;s refusal to turn the emerging corporative state into a truly fascist regime. Preto resided, for a while, in Valencia de Alcántara, near the border with Castelo de Vide, and then in Madrid, as a guest in the house of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, with whom he collaborated in formulating a program for the Falange.

Preto returned to Portugal in February 1935, and was once more detained after instigating a September rebellion with the crew of the &quot;Bartolomeu Dias&quot; and the garrison in the Lisbon-area Penha de França. Again exiled, he fought in the Spanish Civil War on Francisco Franco&#x27;s side.

Preto returned, once more, to Portugal in the eve of the Second World War and published new editions of his work on Italian Fascism originally written in 1922. Preto placed high hopes on the Berlin-Rome axis, and in his introduction to Fascism (&quot;O Fascismo&quot;), he attacked the Salazar regime and exalted Italian and German Fascism. With the rise of Nazism in Germany and Fascism in Italy, Rolao Preto was optimistic about the future of European fascism, he pinned all of his hopes on an Axis victory, and confronted those who were not &quot;real fascists&quot; but wished to adopt aspects of fascism.

After World War II, Rolão Preto abandoned fascism and joined the left-wing forum Movement of Democratic Unity, and he published a volume entitled &quot;A Traição Burguesa&quot; (&quot;The Bourgeois Betrayal&quot;). The book criticised fascist regimes for becoming victims of social and political compromises with the bourgeoisie. In 1945 he thought that &quot;neither the glorious clarions of nationalist mysticism nor the powerful social projections of Nazi efforts can make us forget what Nazism represented — the deception of the revolutionary hopes that gave birth to National Socialism&quot;.

In 1949 participated in General Norton de Matos’s 1949 presidential election campaign. He also backed more liberal candidates for the Presidency, such as Quintão Meireles, Francisco Higino Craveiro Lopes, and, ultimately, had a particularly important role (campaign press manager) in the 1958 campaign of another New State dissident, General Humberto Delgado.

==Later years==

After the fall of the Estado Novo regime Preto attempted to unite the monarchist movement behind Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles&#x27;s Movimento Popular Monárquico. Preto was one of the leaders of the &quot;Movimento&quot; (People&#x27;s Monarchist Party) in the period between the Carnation Revolution (1974) and his death (1977).

In 1994, the Portuguese President Mário Soares granted him, posthumously, the Great Cross of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator.

==Marriage and children==

He married Amália de Brito Boavida Godinho (b. Fundão, Alpedrinha), and had two children:

* Francisco Godinho Rolão Preto (b. Fundão, Soalheira), married to Maria Isabel Correia da Silva Mendes; and
* Maria Teresa Godinho Rolão Preto (b. Fundão, Soalheira), married to Eduardo Teixeira Gomes.

<doc id="1100177" wikidata="Q1541699" url="?curid=1100177" title="County of Empúries">
<text>The County of Empúries (, ), also known as the County of Ampurias (), was a medieval county centred on the town of Empúries and enclosing the Catalan region of Peralada. It corresponds to the historic &quot;comarca&quot; of Empordà.

After the Franks conquered the regions in 785, Empúries and Peralada came under the authority of the County of Girona. Around 813, Empúries, with Peralada, became a separate county under Ermenguer. He and the other early counts were probably of Visigothic origin. In 817, Empúries was merged with the County of Roussillon, a union which lasted until 989. One of the ninth-century counts of Empúries assembled a fleet powerful enough to conquer the Balearic Islands, but only for a brief time. From 835 to 844, Sunyer I ruled Empúries and Peralada while Alaric I ruled Roussillon and Vallespir.

At the death of Gausfred I in 989, Roussillon and Empúries were separated. Gausfred&#x27;s elder son Hugh I received Empúries while Giselbert I received Roussillon. Hugh&#x27;s comital dynasty lasted until 1322, when Empúries passed to a collateral branch of his family.&lt;br&gt; 
The last count, Hugh VI, sold the county to Peter IV of Ribagorza in 1325 in exchange for the barony of Pego and the towns of Xaló and Laguar, all located within the Kingdom of Valencia. Peter later traded it with his brother Ramon Berenguer for the county of Prades in 1341. From that point on, Empúries was an apanage of the Crown of Aragon.

In a letter of December 1002, Pope Sylvester II confirmed the county of Empúries and the &quot;county of Pedralbes&quot; as a part of the diocese of Girona. The latter is probably to be identified with the Peralada region in the north of Empúries. A portion of the &quot;taxes of the port&quot;, consisting of dues and anchorage, were passed on to the diocese.

<doc id="1100181" wikidata="Q441541" url="?curid=1100181" title="Marton, Middlesbrough">
<text>Marton or Marton-in-Cleveland is an area of Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England. Until the 1950s, it was a small village next to the hamlet of Tollesby in Yorkshire&#x27;s North Riding.

The Marton parish originally stretched north to the River Tees, however with the expansion of Middlesbrough, the parish became progressively smaller, ultimately becoming a suburb of south Middlesbrough.

Attractions include Stewart Park, a large public park given by a former councillor, Dormund Stewart, to the people of Middlesbrough in 1928.

At the 2011 census, the Marton Ward (Marton East since 2015) had a population of 4,728 while Marton West Ward had a population of 5,305.

==James Cook==

The explorer, cartographer and navigator, Captain James Cook was born to James and Grace Cook, in a clay-built cottage in the village of Marton in 1728, and he lived for a short time in the village, until the family moved to Great Ayton. A contemporary drawing of the village by George Cuit has revealed the cottage to have significantly deteriorated by as early as 1788, a precursor to it being levelled by new local landowner, Bartholomew Rudd, in the 1790s. It was very close to where the original manor house Marton Lodge eventually stood, to which Rudd made many alterations. Cook later sailed his ship () from Whitby to discover and name for the western world the antipodean continents and islands as well as many islands in the Pacific Ocean.

==Namesakes==
The tiny community of Marton, Queensland, Australia, upstream from Cooktown on the banks of the Endeavour River, was named after James Cook&#x27;s birthplace in remembrance of his 7-week stay in the region in 1770. There is also a town in New Zealand named Marton (renamed thus in 1869 in honour of Cook&#x27;s birthplace). The name of the Yorkshire village derives from a mixture of Old English and Old Norse (&quot;marr-tūn&quot;) which means &quot;Marsh farm/settlement&quot;.

==Stewart Park==
In 1859, the ruin and the land that is now the park were bought by the Middlesbrough ironmaster H. W. F. Bolckow. He built a new hall, which, after serving for a short period of time as a museum, was destroyed during demolition by fire in 1960, after standing empty for several years. The site is now home to the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum, opened in 1978. In addition to viewing the large collection of Cook-related objects at the museum, visitors can view a grade II listed granite urn erected by Bolckow in 1858 on the site of the demolished Cook cottage.

==St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church==

There is no record of the foundation of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church, but there is evidence that it dates from the 12th century, in the Norman period. At that time the overlords of Marton were the de Brus family, ancestors of Robert the Bruce of Scotland. They had founded Gisborough Priory in 1119, and succeeding generations of the family bestowed gifts of land and property on this and other religious houses in the area. The church at Marton was one of those gifts to Guisborough, given before 1187.

In 1540 when the priory was dissolved by King Henry VIII, all the property belonging to the priory reverted to the Crown. In 1545 the living of Marton was granted to the Diocese of York, where it remains to this day.

In 1843 and 1847 a major refurbishment took place, mainly financed by J.B. Rudd of Tollesby Hall, the local squire. A later pen portrait in the Parish magazine tells us that the Church was &quot;restored, widened, and lengthened so that it became, from a little whitewashed, flat ceilinged, sash-windowed, dilapidated edifice with only two aisles and one transept, into the present beautiful building&quot;.

Captain James Cook was baptised at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church. The church is now ornamented with a stained-glass window commemorating Cook.

The graves of Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan, the founding fathers of Bolckow Vaughan — the company which brought the steel industry to Middlesbrough – are in the churchyard. The graves, like the company, had been largely forgotten in the 20th century, but were refurbished in 2009.

==Governance==
In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 4393. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished to form Teesside. Until 1974 it was in the North Riding of Yorkshire, from 1974 to 1996 it was in Cleveland.

=== 2023 local elections results for Marton East Ward ===

In the 2023 local elections, the following members were returned to Middlesbrough Borough Council:

==Notable people==
Other notable persons who lived in the parish of Marton include Bolckow&#x27;s business partner John Vaughan (1799–1868), who lived at Gunnergate Hall until his death; Sir Raylton Dixon (1838–1901), a Middlesbrough shipbuilder; Henry Cochrane, an ironmaster; Agnes Spencer (died 1959), the wife of the founder of Marks and Spencer.

Marton is also the base for a junior football club, Marton F.C., which was founded in 1982 and for which Jonathan Woodgate (born 1980), David Wheater (born 1987) and Stewart Downing (born 1984), subsequent Middlesbrough F.C. professional footballers, once played.

==Education==
Marton has three primary schools: Lingfield Primary School, Captain Cook Primary School and Marton Manor Primary School. There are no secondary schools in Marton. Most pupils go to nearby Nunthorpe School, the King&#x27;s Academy, in Coulby Newham or Trinity Catholic College.

== Demographics ==
==Amenities==

Marton Shops, a parade of local supermarkets, eateries, banks, pharmacy and various other outlets is located on the A172 (Stokesley Road). Marton Library &amp; Community Hub is located on Laurel Road, just behind the shops.

Public houses include the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and the Rudds Arms (both on the A172); the former is located adjacent to the A172 / Stainton Way crossroads and the latter close to the A172 / A174 interchange. The Marton Hotel and Country Club (closed October 2017) was located almost directly opposite to the Rudds Arms before being severely damaged and subsequently demolished in a large blaze in June 2019.

Marton Cricket Club (founded c.1853), located adjacent to the Rudds Arms, play in the North Yorkshire and South Durham Cricket League (NYSD) league. The club&#x27;s pavilion includes a function room available for hire for occasions such as wedding receptions, birthdays, anniversaries, christenings and funerals etc.

==Transport==
Marton is served by bus routes provided by Arriva North East 28, 28a, 29 that connect to Middlesbrough town centre.

Stations in the area are on the Esk Valley Line. Northern operate all services on the line, improvements to the timetable in 2014 meant up to 17 trains (each way) calling at both and railway stations through the week, with a full hourly service being introduced in 2017 including on Sundays. Marton station is located further away to most Marton residents than Gypsy Lane and generally receives less patronage. Marton station is located just off the B1380 (Ladgate Lane), close to the entrance of Ormesby Hall whilst Gypsy Lane station is located approximately halfway along Gypsy Lane, accessed via Stainton Way or Guisborough Road depending on the direction of approach. Gypsy Lane is a no through road at the station.

<doc id="1100182" wikidata="Q2652350" url="?curid=1100182" title="Chaguaramas, Trinidad and Tobago">
<text>Chaguaramas () lies in the Northwest Peninsula of Trinidad west of Port of Spain; the name is often applied to the entire peninsula, but is sometimes used to refer to its most developed area. The developed area in Chaguaramas starts at an Aloca aluminum manufacturing plant and dock, and ends at the Army and Coast Guard camps on the mainland. Offshore, a group known as The Five Islands are in various stages of development or redevelopment, as of 2016.

Most of the roadway in Chaguaramas lies close to the coastline and one can view the sea from the winding road. It is about 14 km from Port of Spain.

==Leasing of Chaguaramas to the United States==

The entire peninsula was leased to the United States in 1940 for the construction of a naval base, Naval Base Trinidad, under the &quot;Destroyers for Bases Agreement&quot;.

The base was also used during the early 1960s as a BMEWS early warning radar site, as well as a missile tracking site on the U.S. Air Force Eastern Test Range.
The base was scaled back in 1956 and the area was returned to Trinidad and Tobago control in 1963.

==Treaty of Chaguaramas and CARICOM==
Chaguaramas was the location slated for the construction of the capital of the short-lived West Indies Federation. It is also the place where the Treaty of Chaguaramas was signed, establishing CARICOM, the Caribbean Community and Common Market, in 1973.

==Activities and Places of Interest==

===Dry forests===
The Chaguaramas Peninsula supports one of the few remaining areas of dry forest in western Trinidad.

=== Cycling and kayaking===
On weekends groups of persons enter Chaguaramas to cycle on or kayak in rented equipment. During the week, the roadway is used as a training ground for persons who cycle in groups either for sport or as a part of a training session for a Tri-athalon. Mountain biking has grown in popularity and an extensive trail network has been developed in Tucker Valley. These trails are created and maintained by the local Mountain Bike community.

===The Chaguaramas Boardwalk Area===
The Chaguaramas Boardwalk was developed by the Chaguaramas Development Authority (CDA) as part of its tourism developmental thrust. The Boardwalk stretches for approximately 1300 feet along the shore of one of the Bays. The Boardwalk can be used as an exercise route for pedestrians or for young families who stroll or as a stepping stone to get to the water to swim for leisure or as part of a training regimen.

Available in close proximity to the Boardwalk are Gazebos and Pedal Boats which are available for rent. There is also the Dancing Water Fountain, the Trees Vendor Plaza and Miniature Off Road Activities according to the CDA&#x27;s website.

===Chaguaramas Golf Course===
The Chaguaramas Golf Course is &quot;a 9-hole course&quot; and the only &quot;public&quot; golf course in the twin-island Republic. The Golf Course at Chaguaramas has been in existence for some forty plus (40+) years and is one of the older, if not the oldest golf course in the island.

===Pier 1===
Pier 1 was designed to host functions for large numbers of persons. The venue was designed to host events in small areas within a larger setting, thus it can serve a large number of persons with different tastes through the use of the smaller areas as niche spots.

===Yacht===
Chaguaramas has been the center of yachting activity in Trinidad. There are several marinas within the Chaguaramas area which provide repair services or on-land boarding services for yachts. There is also the option to refuel and stock supplies or just moor the yacht at a pier or in a sheltered bay facility and visit the island.

===Heritage Parks, Macqueripe and The Magnificent Edith Falls===
According to the CDA, the Gasparee Cave on Gasparee Island, along with the Salt Pond on Chacachacare and the Bellerand Heritage Park fall within the boundaries of Chaguaramas. Although Gasparee has been developed with housing facilities, to a large extent efforts have been made to preserve the birds on the island, through the &quot;upkeep&quot; of the large trees which provide shelter at great heights for them.

&quot;Conveniently located just off the Macqueripe Road, Bellerand Heritage Park is surrounded by various areas offering recreational activities such as golfing, swimming and is a &#x27;stone&#x27;s throw&#x27; away from the Magnificent Edith Falls&quot;. Another heritage park which is located within the Macqueripe area in Chaguaramas is Samaan Park.

At Macqueripe, one is allowed to swim in the sea as the area is located in an inlet. However great care should be exercised in entering and exiting the water as due to dredging of the seabed many years ago, there is a sharp descent of several feet close to the shore. The drop/ or descent can make the area perilous for newly trained swimmers and the extremely short person entering or exiting the water.

===Tucker Valley===
Tucker Valley is known for several points of interest such as: The Bamboo Cathedral, The UPick Farm and Restaurant, The World War Bunker, and The Nutmeg Grove among other things.

The Bamboo Cathedral is well known by photographers who capture images of many newly engaged couples strolling in the area. The wide lane of the roadway with the bamboos intertwining overhead creates an image of seclusion and sets the tone for newly engaged wonder!

The UPick Farm &quot;sells a wide range of fruits and vegetables (grown off-site) both local and imported&quot;. Also available at the UPick Farm are guided tours and field trips for primary and secondary school children.

===DockSide Facilities===
The Chaguaramas area also contains some dockside facilities, mostly for the transfer of bauxite ore between ship and shore, or from smaller boats to ocean-going vessels. The function of such docks is easily recognizable as the docks and buildings are colored pink from the bauxite dust.

===Hunting and Fishing===
After the Trinidad and Tobago government passed the Conservation and Wildlife Act in 1960, hunting is strictly prohibited. This law is upheld by the Chaguaramas Development Authority. Chaguaramas is however one of the country&#x27;s most popular spots for Tarpon fishing. In 2010, Sportsfishing Magazine names Chaguaramas waters one of their top locations for fishing Tarpon.

<text>Uri Savir (; 7 January 1953 – 14 May 2022) was an Israeli diplomat and politician. He was Israel&#x27;s chief negotiator for the Oslo Accords and served as a Member of Knesset (MK) from 1999 to 2001.

==Early life==
Savir was born in Jerusalem on 7 January 1953. His father, Leo, co-founded the Israeli Foreign Service. Savir studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in international relations.

==Career==
Savir first worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an information officer at the Israeli embassy in Canada, before acting as a press officer at the consulate in New York City. He became the communications advisor of Shimon Peres in 1984, as well as one of his senior advisers. In that capacity, Savir participated in Peres&#x27; ground-breaking visit to Morocco in July 1986. Savir was subsequently appointed consul-general in New York in 1988, serving in that role for four years.

Savir was named director-general of the Foreign Ministry in 1993 by Peres, who was foreign minister in the second Rabin cabinet. During his tenure, he was the chief negotiator for the Oslo Accords. His experience became the basis for his book &quot;The Process: 1,100 Days that Changed the Middle East&quot;, published in 1998. He was also a member of the Israeli delegation for negotiations with Jordan that resulted in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, as well as head of the delegation for talks with Syria from 1995 to 1996.

In the 1999 elections, Savir was elected to the Knesset on the Centre Party list. He and two other MKs left the Centre Party on 6 March 2001 to form the New Way faction. Three weeks later on 28 March, he resigned from the Knesset, and was replaced by David Magen, who represented the Centre Party. During Savir&#x27;s time in the Knesset he served on a number of committees, including the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

Savir established the Glocal Forum, a non-profit organization involved in international relations. He also co-founded the Peres Center for Peace in 1996 and served as its director-general until 1999. He later established the Facebook group titled &quot;YaLa-Young Leaders&quot;, a peace movement for Middle Eastern and North African youths to foster dialogue and change with Israeli peers. It had more than 800,000 followers at the time of his death.

==Personal life==
Savir was married to Aliza until his death. Together, they had one daughter, Maya Savir.

Savir died on 14 May 2022, at the age of 69. The cause of death was not disclosed.

<text>Rafael Moreu (born ) is an American screenwriter, best known for his work in horror and thrillers.

==Early life and education==
Moreu was born in Miami, Florida, to a family who had fled Cuba in the early 1960s. He is a graduate of New York University, where he studied film and met his future wife Kristin Ellingson, whom he married in 1989.

==Career==
Moreu wrote the movies &quot;Hackers&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot; (1999). For &quot;Hackers&quot;, he saw the film as more than just about computer hacking but something much larger: &quot;In fact, to call hackers a counterculture makes it sound like they&#x27;re a transitory thing; I think they&#x27;re the next step in human evolution.&quot; He had been interested in hacking since the early 1980s. After the crackdown in the United States during 1989 and 1990, he decided to write a script about the subculture. For research, Moreu went to a meeting organized by the New York-based hacker magazine &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot;. There, he met Phiber Optik, a.k.a. Mark Abene, a 22-year-old hacker who spent most of 1994 in prison on hacking charges. Moreu also hung out with other young hackers being harassed by the government and began to figure out how it would translate into a film. He remembered, &quot;One guy was talking about how he&#x27;d done some really interesting stuff with a laptop and payphones and that cracked it for me, because it made it cinematic&quot;.

&quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;The Curse&quot;, was initially scheduled to start production in 1996 with Emily Bergl in the lead, but production stalled for two years. The film eventually went into production in 1998 under the title &quot;Carrie 2: Say You&#x27;re Sorry&quot;.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was built as a fast cargo vessel for the New England Navigation Company by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia in 1907. In 1911 the ship was sold to the Maine Steamship Company and converted to passenger service. The next year &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was sold to the Eastern Steamship Corporation. The ship then operated in overnight coastal passenger steamer service through the Cape Cod Canal and Long Island Sound between Boston and New York City. After the US entered World War I, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and her sister ship , were among eight civilian steamships purchased to lay the North Sea Mine Barrage.

==Construction==
Three new ships for the New England Navigation Company, controlled by the New Haven railroad interests, were designed to compete with the Metropolitan Line vessels and &quot;Harvard&quot; using the outside, offshore passage yet be capable of using the inside passage through sounds. The three vessels were designed by the Quintard Iron Works Company of New York with heavy construction for offshore operation and characteristics necessary for inshore operation. The main deck, with the exception of machinery was designed for 1,500 tons of cargo. The second deck had officers quarters and a few passenger staterooms with more officers quarters on the upper deck. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; had reciprocating engines driving twin screws while the later &quot;Old Colony&quot;, otherwise identical, was designed with Parsons turbines driving triple screws.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was laid down in 1907, by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as hull number 342, U.S. Official Number 204012 and signal KWBM, for the New England Navigation Company. The ship was launched 29 January 1907.

As built propulsion machinery was by two four cylinder, triple expansion engines supplied with steam by eight single ended boilers. The vessel was twin screw with the contract requiring the engines develop 7,000 horsepower. The ship made a trial run on 4 June 1907 between New York and Fall River exceeded requirements for with 720 tons of cargo making the run in 7 hours and 48 minutes with an average speed of with 800 tons of cargo.

The conversion in 1911 changed registered tonnage from , to , and depth of hold from to . Registered crew size went from 60 to 107 

==Commercial service==
Along with her sister ships, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and , &quot;Massachusetts&quot; provided overnight coastal cargo steamer service through the Cape Cod Canal and Long Island Sound between New York City, Boston, and Portland, Maine.

In 1911, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; returned to the Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard for conversion to passenger service and from coal to fuel oil in 1912 with the ship being sold to the Eastern Steamship Corporation. Financial difficulties forced Eastern Steamship Corporation into receivership in 1914, and it emerged three years later as the Eastern Steamship Lines.

==Service history==

===World War I===
In April 1917, the Allies formulated a plan to lay minefields in the North Sea to counter German U-boat attacks on their shipping in the Atlantic. Known as the North Sea Mine Barrage, or Northern Barrage, these mines laid between Scotland and Norway would, they thought, limit German submarine access to the Atlantic from the North Sea. This plan involved the creation of a new generation of minelayers of which &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was included.

On 2 November 1917, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; were purchased by the US Navy for $1,350,000 each and sent to the Boston Navy Yard for conversion to minelayers. Sister ship Old Colony was purchased for $1,150,000. Before &quot;Massachusetts&quot; completed her conversion she was renamed &quot;Shawmut&quot; after the Shawmut Peninsula on the Charles River that flows through Boston. She was the second ship in the Navy to carry the name and was commissioned as USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (ID 1255) on 7 December 1917, with Captain Wat T. Cluverius in command.

After her extensive conversion from a passenger steamer to a minelayer, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was renamed USS &quot;Shawmut&quot; (ID 1255) on 7 January 1918 and departed the Navy Yard at Boston on 11 June 1918. She completed her sea trials in Presidents Roads, Massachusetts before steaming to Naval Base 17 at Inverness, Scotland, where she anchored on 30 June 1918. The sea trials had revealed that she and &quot;Aroostook&quot; – the new name for &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; – consumed fuel at a higher rate than expected, raising concerns that they would be unable to make a non-stop trans-Atlantic voyage. Cluverius and Commander Roscoe Bulmer devised a plan to refuel both ships while underway with hoses from the destroyer tender . Although this technique was uncommon at the time, and was done during a gale, both ships successfully refueled.
Over the next several months the Mine Force planted mines in the North Sea along with their Allied counterparts. &quot;Shawmut&quot; took part in ten minelaying excursions, placing 2,970 mines for the barrage.

Hostilities ceased on 11 November 1918. &quot;Shawmut&quot; then loaded 310 mines and set sail for the US with various other minelayers on 30 November. She reached Hampton Roads Naval Operations Base (NOB), Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 December 1918.

===Between the wars===
&quot;Shawmut&quot; was reassigned to the US Air Department after refitting at Boston Navy Yard to serve as a seaplane tender. The ship carried out the majority of her duties tending the amphibious aircraft off the eastern seaboard of the United States from Key West, Florida, to Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Her voyages frequently took her to foreign ports including: Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica; Samaná Bay, Dominican Republic; and Trujillo, Panama. On 17 July 1920, she was reclassified as CM-4 (Cruiser-Minelayer #4).

In June and July 1921, &quot;Shawmut&quot; participated in an event that is a major milestone in military aviation history, now known as Project B. The experiences of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell during the war had caused him to become an outspoken advocate for the use of winged aircraft in military operations, which was then a new concept. He argued for the establishment of an independent air force and expanding the use of winged aircraft. His undiplomatic style hindered acceptance by his colleagues, among the beliefs of whom was that aircraft would be ineffective as weapons against contemporary military vessels. Mitchell proved them wrong during a series of bombing exercises in the summer of 1921, in the Hampton Roads, off the coast of Virginia. For a part of these, two US Army photographers from Langley Army Air Field joined &quot;Shawmut&quot; to document attacks on the captured German U-boat, , that was used as the first target.

After participating in the bombing exercises, &quot;Shawmut&quot; returned to her routine as an aircraft tender for the rest of summer of 1921. She entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for an overhaul on 31 October, where she remained until 5 January 1922. She then returned to her primary duties as a minelayer but also continued to provide services to Navy planes. The duties took her back to the Caribbean, as well as operating along the US east coast for battle practice, gunnery and mining exercises.

In early November 1922, after she had finished maintenance and repair at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, &quot;Shawmut&quot; was ordered to Honduras, to return the body of that country&#x27;s ambassador to the US, who had died in Washington, D.C. After the state funeral in Amapala, Honduras, she continued with the body for burial at La Libertad, El Salvador. &quot;Shawmut&quot; then returned to Philadelphia, where she underwent more upkeep and repair between 6 December 1922 – 3 January 1923.

In February 1923, &quot;Shawmut&quot; served as the radio control ship for the remotely-controlled target ship &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; (ex-) during Fleet Problem I off the coast of Panama.

Through the next two decades, she served as a seaplane tender and minelayer. To avoid confusion with the similar sounding , a hospital ship, the &quot;Shawmut&quot; was renamed &quot;Oglala&quot; on 1 January 1928. At about the same time, she was given new boilers and other modifications, changing her appearance from two smokestacks to one. &quot;Oglala&quot; was flagship of the 1934 Aleutian Islands Survey Expedition.

===World War II===

====Pearl Harbor====
In 1941, &quot;Oglala&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral William R. Furlong, commander of minecraft for the Battle Force of the Pacific Fleet.

On the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;Oglala&quot; lay moored outboard of light cruiser alongside Ten Ten Pier, Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. Around 07:55, her sailors began firing on attacking Japanese aircraft. A Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; carrier torpedo bomber released a torpedo that detonated near her port side in between her and &quot;Helena&quot;. The blast ruptured her port hull and lifted fireroom floor plates, causing her to immediately take on water as, almost simultaneously, Japanese planes strafed her. Since the ship was receiving power from the dock, the crew was unable to start her pumps to deal with the deluge of water. This damage would later give her a reputation as &quot;the only ship ever to sink from fright.&quot;

Approximately five minutes into the attack, a bomb fell into the water between &quot;Oglala&quot; and her companion cruiser, detonating near her fireroom. She began to list five degrees to port and the rate at which she was flooding meant she would not remain afloat. Commander Roland E. Krause, the executive officer, who was in command at the time, decided to move the ship clear of &quot;Helena&quot; and secure her directly to the pier. This was achieved by around 09:00, but 30 minutes later her list had increased to twenty degrees and the order was given to abandon ship. Sometime around 10:00, she rolled toward the dock severing her bridge structure and main mast as she settled to the bottom on her port side.

None of the crew of &quot;Oglala&quot; were killed in the attack, although three received injuries. In his subsequent report, Commander Edmond Pryor Speight, commanding officer of &quot;Oglala&quot;, commended the entire crew for performing in accord to the “highest tradition of the Navy,” but particularly singled out two sailors. Fireman Second Class Jerald &quot;E&quot; Johnson took decisive action in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Johnson secured the boiler and fireroom preventing the chance of a boiler explosion and curtailing some the flooding of the ship. Chief Boatswains Mate Anthony Zito was able to quickly get &quot;Oglala&quot;″s /50 caliber anti-aircraft gun into action to fire on the approaching Japanese planes. After the order was given to abandon &quot;Oglala&quot;, Zito commandeered a drifting motor launch and two of his shipmates then sped to give assistance to the ships on Battleship Row.

====Salvage====
The effort to salvage &quot;Oglala&quot; began on 12 December 1941. The first attempt to refloat her by blowing compressed air into her hull was ineffective. Several plans for her future were considered, including floating her enough to drag her ashore, where she would be dismantled. After a re-examination of the situation, a plan was formulated to raise and refit her. By the early spring of 1942, the salvage operation was underway. It was decided that using ten submarine salvage pontoons in concert with anchor chains and the aforementioned air bubble technique to right her. The salvage effort was made more complex by &quot;Oglala&quot;″s poor stability. Fifteen to eighteen divers were kept busy for nearly 2,000 underwater hours during the salvage, patching her hull, rigging chains, cutting away unwanted structure and executing many other tasks. After her tophamper had been removed, the salvage pontoons were used to pull the ship upright while air was pumped into her to lighten the load. The parbuckling, or righting attempt, was begun on 11 April 1942, and on 22 April, the crane barge &quot;Gaylord&quot;, of the Hawaiian Dredging Company, was rigged to &quot;Oglala&quot; to pull her over, if needed, as she was righted the following day. The operation was a success and &quot;Oglala&quot; came upright to rest on her bottom.

On 23 June, after six months with her port side beneath the surface, &quot;Oglala&quot; was floated. The salvage crew was unable to bring her to the draft depth required by the keel blocks in the dry dock, however, and the ship was unsteady. Work began to increase draft and improve her stability but during the night of 25–26 June 1942, the pumps being used to keep her afloat were overwhelmed by an influx of water and she settled to the bottom again. An investigation revealed that the fuel line for the main gasoline powered pump had become clogged overnight, and the electrical back-up pump was not effective because the water level did not rise high enough. While attempting to refloat her again on 29 June, a failure to the cofferdam in aft section caused her once more to settle down. It was determined that, for a second time, the field crew had not built the cofferdam to the proper specifications. After repairs to that, she was floated for a third time on 1 July. A spillage of gasoline on the same day while refuelling caused a fire that was extinguished in 30 minutes, before it could cause any serious damage. When &quot;Oglala&quot; was finally towed to the dry dock, the bow was the only part of her above the waterline. Once she was settled into the keel blocks, the refitting work began.

====Conversion to internal combustion engine repair ship====
On 23 December 1942, &quot;Oglala&quot; was sea worthy. She sailed via Mare Island for the shipyard at Terminal Island Naval Dry Docks and was moved into the shipyard itself on 1 March 1943. Reconstruction plans finalized at Mare Island meant that her days as a minelayer came to a close. Her refitting included a complete conversion into an engine repair ship. On 15 June 1943, &quot;Oglala&quot; was reclassified to an internal combustion engine repair ship ARG-1. While she was undergoing conversion, &quot;Oglala&quot; remained assigned to Mine Squadron (MinRon) 1 in the Service Squadron (ServRon) within the Pacific Fleet. In November, she received word that her assignment would be shifted to the Seventh Fleet when she completed converting.

Due to construction delays, &quot;Oglala&quot;″s conversion missed the initial completion date of 1 February 1944. She had been scheduled to begin dock trials on 17 February, but the lack of progress by the construction crews caused them to be cancelled. On 28 February, she was moved under tow to a berth at the Naval Supply Depot, San Pedro, California, to begin loading the ship&#x27;s stores and continue the conversion. She began preliminary acceptance dock trials on 2 March. Oglala was accepted into service on 16 March. After completed her sea trials, 21–26 March, she reported ready for duty on 30 March, and was independently underway to her new home at Milne Bay, New Guinea the following day. Oglala reported for duty at Milne Bay on 24 April, and began receiving ships alongside for repair work on 29 April.

====Southwest Pacific service====
In the wake of Operations Reckless and Persecution in the late spring, May–June 1944, that pushed the Japanese out of Hollandia, New Guinea, &quot;Oglala&quot; got underway in the early dawn hours of 1 July, to provide repair services at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea. That night, at 22:00, &quot;Oglala&quot;″s radar picked up several small vessels off of her port bow at approximately . Thirteen minutes later the boats were off of her port beam. It appeared as if they would pass clear. Suddenly the lead craft made a turn to port and attempted to cross &quot;Oglala&quot;″s bow. &quot;Oglala&quot; put her rudder hard to port and her engine to full stop in an attempt to avoid a collision. One of the picket boats struck her stern and a mechanized landing craft (LCM) struck the port bow frame. The LCM capsized, dumping her occupants into the sea, and the picket boat sank in approximately one minute. &quot;Oglala&quot; dispatched her whale boat and trained floodlights on the water to search for survivors. The whaleboat returned with 1st Lieutenant J.T. Barron, USA, of Company B, 533rd Engineer Boats and Shore Regiment, who informed &quot;Oglala&quot;″s commanding officer, Commander Henry K. Bradford, that all of the men were safely pulled from the water. Barron was asleep in the picket boat at the time of the collision and could not provide an explanation as to why it made a sudden course correction. The formation was underway to Milne Bay from Finschhafen, New Guinea. The young officer was provided with new navigation charts having lost his copies when the picket boat sank and sent on his way. &quot;Oglala&quot; safely arrived at Humboldt Bay on 6 July 1944. She shifted her berth to Imbi Bay at Hollandia the next day.

With more successful Allied campaigns moving the Japanese off of more territory, &quot;Oglala&quot; was underway once again to provide support. On 14 December, in the waning days of the Battle of Leyte, 17 October–26 December 1944, she was ordered to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands. &quot;Oglala&quot; lay at San Pedro Bay, tending various types of small craft, when she received word of the Japanese surrender, on 15 August. She remained in those waters until ordered to return to San Francisco in January 1946.

===Decommissioning===
On 9 January 1946, &quot;Oglala&quot; sailed for the US, via Guiuan and Pearl Harbor. She dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay on 10 February 1946. On 28 March 1946, infantry landing craft began stripping her of material in preparation to join the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, California. She was decommissioned on 8 July 1946 and removed from the Naval Register on 11 July 1946.

Transferred to the Maritime Commission (MARCOM) on 11 July 1946, &quot;Oglala&quot; remained with the “mothball fleet,” berthed in the Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, for almost two decades. She was sold to Nicolai Joffe Corporation, Beverly Hills, California, on 15 July 1965 and withdrawn from the fleet 2 September 1965 to be broken up for scrap.

<text>Iain Declan Softley (born 30 November 1956) is an English film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films include &quot;Backbeat,&quot; &quot;Hackers, The Wings of the Dove&quot;, &quot;K-PAX&quot;, &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot;, &quot;Inkheart&quot; and the BBC adaptation of Sadie Jones&#x27;s novel &quot;The Outcast&quot;.

==Career==
Softley was educated at St Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing, London, and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he directed a number of highly-praised theatrical productions. He worked for Granada TV and the BBC in the 1980s before moving on to music videos and film.

Softley&#x27;s first film, the Stuart Sutcliffe biopic, &quot;Backbeat&quot;, which he wrote and directed, was released in 1994. It opened the Sundance Film Festival and went on to receive a BAFTA Award nomination for Best British Film. For his work on the film, Softley received Best Newcomer Awards from The London Film Critics Circle and Empire Magazine.

Following Backbeat, Softley directed the cyber thriller &quot;Hackers&quot;, starring Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee-Miller. This was followed in 1997 by an adaptation of Henry James&#x27; novel, &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, starring Helena Bonham-Carter. The film premiered at the Toronto and Venice Film Festivals, earned four Academy Award nominations, and won a number of awards including two BAFTAs and multiple acting honors for Bonham Carter.

Softley&#x27;s next two films (released by Universal Pictures) topped the US box office: the sci-fi mystery film &quot;K-PAX&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey, and Jeff Bridges, and the suspense thriller, &quot;The Skeleton Key&quot; with Kate Hudson, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt.

Other film credits include: &quot;Inkheart&quot;, from Cornelia Funke&#x27;s best-selling book, with Helen Mirren, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent; &quot;Trap for Cinderella,&quot; starring Tuppence Middleton and Alexandra Roach, which Softley adapted and directed from Sebastien Japrisot&#x27;s French crime novel; and &quot;Curve&quot; starring Julianne Hough, produced by Blumhouse Productions and released by Universal Pictures in 2016.

In 2010, Softley directed a stage adaptation of &quot;Backbeat,&quot; which was co-written with Stephen Jeffreys. It premiered at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow, before transferring to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, in London and then subsequently Toronto, Los Angeles and Berlin.

In 2016, it was announced that Softley will direct &quot;Icarus&quot;, based on the life of British/American astronaut, Michael Foale, which Softley has developed with writers Hilary Thompson and Laurence Coriat. He will co-produce the project through his company, Forthcoming Films. Softley attended Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge at the same time as Foale.

Aside from his work in film, Softley has also worked in television. In 2012, he directed the short film, &quot;The Man&quot;, as part of Sky Arts&#x27; Playhouse Presents strand. The film was a satirical take on the clandestine Bilderberg Group and starred Stellan Skarsgard, Zoe Wannamaker, Hayley Atwell and Stephen Fry. In 2015, the BBC broadcast a two-part adaptation of author Sadie Jones&#x27; novel &quot;The Outcast&quot; which Softley also directed. The film was warmly received by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with Julia Raeside writing: &quot;The tone set by Iain Softley&#x27;s beautifully restrained direction and the careful use of music creates a real feeling of loss from the start, just as in the book, but he somehow avoids all hammy visual foreshadowing and narrative signposting, so often used to gee a plot along&quot;.

Softley also directed the upcoming Disney+ short film &quot;The Shepherd&quot;, which stars John Travolta and is an adaptation of Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shepherd&quot;.

==Production company==
Together with his wife, film producer Sarah Curtis, Softley runs Forthcoming Films, which produces and develops their respective projects. Past productions include: &quot;Backbeat&quot;, &quot;On a Clear Day&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Trap for Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Ophelia&quot;.

Future productions include: the Michael Foale biopic &quot;Icarus.&quot;

==Personal life==
Softley and Curtis live in London. Together, they have three children.

<doc id="1100200" wikidata="Q16982487" url="?curid=1100200" title="Near Westside, Syracuse">
<text>The Near Westside is one of the oldest neighborhoods of Syracuse, New York, United States. In the early 1900s, many wealthy families, including the Mayor of Syracuse, lived in large homes along West Onondaga Street. A beautiful fountain with statues was located at Onondaga Circle, the junction of West Onondaga Street and Delaware Street. Streets like Delaware Street were lined with large elm trees and stately homes.

==History==

===Industrial===

Along the western border of the neighborhood, a multitude of factories employed local residents. These included Franklin Automobile Company, which produced luxury air-cooled cars from 1904 to 1934, and Lipe-Rollway Company, a manufacturer of gears. The main hub of industry started at South Geddes Street, not far from where George Fowler High School and City Hardware of Calley&#x27;s United Appliance stand today. At the turn of the 19th century, typewriter factories, machinery factories and a large railroad yard along West Fayette Street provided jobs to the residents of the neighborhood.

===Recent years===

Today, the Near Westside is home to Syracuse&#x27;s growing Latino community, with high numbers of Puerto Rican and Cuban families. St Lucy&#x27;s Catholic Church continues to serve the area and its growing Latino population, offering services for immigrants and refugees at the West Side Learning Center, as well as hosting events such as Latino town hall meetings at the St Lucy&#x27;s Auditorium.

The area is described as one of America&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods by United Way of Central New York, with high levels of child poverty. Fowler High School, located on the western end of the neighborhood, has a high percentage of students eligible for free and reduced lunch, among other topics of concern within the community.

The area is served by many non-profit organizations. Several organizations based in this neighborhood provide services for the Latino community, such as the Spanish Action League and Syracuse Area Latinos United against Disparities (SALUD) Inc.

A number of economic and residential development projects have also taken place in the neighborhood&#x27;s SALT District, led by the Near Westside Initiative, a not-for-profit organization that leverages the resources of Syracuse University. Branding itself as a distinct &quot;neighborhood within a neighborhood&quot;, the SALT District has adopted a colorful logo and brand identity of &quot;Syracuse. Arts. Literacy. Technology.&quot; The acronym SALT is a reference to the salt production industry that led to Syracuse&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Salt City&quot;. The Gifford Foundation, Syracuse University&#x27;s School of Architecture, Syracuse Center of Excellence, and Home HeadQuarters have also played key roles in the initiative.

To the far south of the neighborhood is Syracuse&#x27;s newly-branded City-Gate Historic Neighborhood (2017). The West Onondaga Street Alliance (WOSA), with the support of Eric Mower &amp; Associates and Cowley Advertising, have taken the initiative to reinvent and improve the neighborhood. The lack of interest in this historic neighborhood for several decades, and the increasing high concentration of poverty, have left the West Onondaga Street Corridor as nothing more than a conduit to reach other nearby neighborhoods. In 2015, the WOSA began to organize to change the direction of the corridor. Today, the City-Gate Historic Neighborhood is a beautiful, historic, and diverse neighborhood. Many business and development opportunities are available.

In 2015, the Everything Oz Museum, a 501c3 non-profit located in Chittenango, New York, purchased the Neal-Baum Mansion for the purpose of opening the nation&#x27;s largest International Wizard of Oz Museum. L. Frank Baum, author of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, married his wife in this house. Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, a nearby suburb of Syracuse.

<doc id="1100202" wikidata="Q1325987" url="?curid=1100202" title="Tyson Foods">
<text>Tyson Foods, Inc. is an American multinational corporation based in Springdale, Arkansas that operates in the food industry. The company is the world&#x27;s second-largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork after JBS S.A. It is the largest meat company in America. It annually exports the largest percentage of beef out of the United States. Together with its subsidiaries, it operates major food brands, including Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright Brand, Aidells, and State Fair. Tyson Foods ranked No. 79 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

Tyson Foods has been involved in a number of controversies related to the environment, animal welfare, and the welfare of their own employees. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tyson Foods was accused by some employees of failing to implement certain recommended protections, including physical distancing measures, plexiglass barriers and wearing of face masks. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the company, alleging gross and willful negligence for the spread of COVID-19 at their plants. Additionally, Tyson is being investigated for allegations of child labor.

==History==
The company was established by John W. Tyson in 1935. It expanded during World War II, when chicken was not included in foods that were rationed by the federal government. As of 2019, the company employs 141,000 people, including 122,000 in the United States. Tyson&#x27;s locations are concentrated in the Midwest and South, with 16 locations in Arkansas, 11 in Texas, 9 in Iowa, and the remainder mostly in the eastern U.S., including Tennessee.

Tyson produces about one-fifth of the beef, chicken, and pork sold in the United States. It is one of the largest U.S. marketers of chicken, beef and pork to retail grocers, broad line foodservice distributors and national fast food and full-service restaurant chains; fresh beef and pork; frozen and fully cooked chicken, beef and pork products; case-ready beef and pork; supermarket deli chicken products; meat toppings for the pizza industry and retail frozen pizza; club store chicken, beef and pork; ground beef and flour tortillas. It supplies Yum! Brands chains that use chicken, including KFC and Taco Bell, as well as McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, Wendy&#x27;s, Walmart, Kroger, IGA, Beef O&#x27;Brady&#x27;s, small restaurant businesses, and prisons.

The company makes a wide variety of animal-based, prepared foods and plant-based products at its 123 food processing plants. It produces many different products, including Buffalo wings, boneless Buffalo wings, chicken nuggets, and tenders. Its plants slaughter approximately 155,000 cattle, 461,000 pigs, and 45,000,000 chickens every week. Their largest meat packing facility is their beef production plant in Dakota City, Nebraska. Other plants include feed mills, hatcheries, farms and tanneries.

In 2019, the company entered the plant protein category with their Raised &amp; Rooted brand. The brand initially included vegetarian nuggets as well as burgers with a blend of beef and pea protein, then expanded to include tenders. In 2020 Tyson discontinued the burger and removed egg whites from the nuggets, announcing that the Raised &amp; Rooted brand would be free of animal products moving forward. In 2021, the company launched two vegetarian patty breakfast sandwiches under its Jimmy Dean brand.

On June 13, 2024, Tyson Foods heir John R. Tyson, who has served as the company&#x27;s chief financial officer (CFO), would be suspended from the company following his second alcohol related arrest.

===Acquisitions and investments===
In 2001, Tyson Foods acquired IBP, Inc., the largest beef packer and number two pork processor in the United States., for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Along with its purchase of IBP, it also acquired the naming rights to an event center in Sioux City, Iowa. Tyson has also acquired such companies as Hudson Foods Company, Garrett poultry, Washington Creamery, Franz Foods, Prospect Farms, Krispy Kitchens, Ocoma Foods, Cassady Broiler, Vantress Pedigree, Wilson Foods, Honeybear Foods, Mexican Original, Valmac Industries, Heritage Valley, Lane Poultry, Cobb-Vantress, Holly Farms, Wright Brand Foods, Inc. and Don Julio Foods. On May 29, 2014, the company announced a $6.13 billion cash offer to acquire all the shares in Hillshire Brands, two days after a $6.4 billion cash and shares bid for Hillshire by Pilgrim&#x27;s Corp. In June 2014, Tyson won the bidding war against Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride, agreeing to buy the maker of Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs for $8.5 billion. On July 28, 2014, the company said it would sell its Mexican and Brazilian poultry businesses to JBS S.A. for $575 million and use the proceeds to pay down debt from its pending $7.7 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co.

In April 2017, Tyson announced plans to acquire AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, a supplier of packaged sandwiches, for approximately $3.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on June 7, 2017.

In November 2017, Tyson Foods bought the Philadelphia-based cheesesteak company Original Philly Holdings.

In May 2018, Tyson announced the acquisition of American Proteins, Inc. and AMPRO Products, Inc. for approximately $850 million.

On June 1, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell the Sara Lee, Van&#x27;s, Chef Pierre and Bistro Collection brands to Kohlberg &amp; Company. The sale was completed on August 1. What is now known as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery will be based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.

In mid-2018, Tyson Foods agreed to acquire the organic chicken and chicken-sausage brand Smart Chicken and parent company Tecumseh Poultry.

On August 9, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell its pizza crust business, including TNT Crust, to Austin-based Peak Rock Capital, who completed the acquisition on September 4.

On August 20, 2018, Tyson announced its intent to acquire food supplier Keystone Foods from Marfrig. Tyson announced it had completed the acquisition on November 30, 2018.

On February 7, 2019, Tyson Foods reached an agreement to acquire the European and Thai businesses of Brazilian food company BRF. The acquisition was completed on June 3, 2019.

On January 10, 2020, Tyson Foods announced that it sold its Golden Island jerky business to Jack Link&#x27;s.

On May 15, 2021, Tyson Foods announced that it was selling its pet treats business, including True Chews, Nudges and Top Chews, to General Mills for $1.2 billion. The sale was completed on July 7, 2021.

In March 2024, it was announced Tyson Foods had sold its broiler processing plant, hatchery and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri to the American fresh egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods for an undisclosed amount.

====Meat alternatives and clean meat====

In 2016, Tyson Foods bought a 5% stake in the meat alternative company Beyond Meat, becoming the first major meat producer to invest in a meat alternative company. Tyson made an additional investment in Beyond Meat in 2017. In 2019, Tyson sold its stake in advance of Beyond Meat&#x27;s initial public offering, with CEO Noel White saying Tyson intended to develop its own meat alternatives. The company also developed the &quot;blended products&quot; line called &quot;Raised and Rooted&quot;, which featured a combination of animal and plant based ingredients. This line includes a burger that is produced from a combination of beef and pea protein isolate.

In early 2018, Tyson, through its venture capital arm Tyson Ventures, funded clean meat (cultured meat) research with an investment in California-based Memphis Meats. The same year, Tyson Ventures also invested $2.2 million in Israel-based clean meat company Future Meat. 

Former CEO Tom Hayes said that Tyson&#x27;s investments in clean meat and meat alternatives &quot;might seem counterintuitive&quot;, but they are part of an effort to meet future consumer demand in a sustainable way. The company also announced in July 2015 that it had reduced the use of human antibiotics in their chicken by more than 84 percent since 2011.

====Insects====
In 2023, Tyson announced an investment in Protix, a company which raises insects to feed to pets and to non-human animals intended for human consumption.

===Corporate charity===
Since 2000, Tyson Foods has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country. Forbes named Tyson Foods the second most proportionally generous company for its donations in 2007, totaling 1.6 percent ($8 million) of its annual operating income. Tyson initiated the KNOW Hunger campaign in early 2011 to raise awareness of hunger in the United States. After the Joplin, Missouri tornado of 2011, Tyson sent 77,000 pounds of food to the city. It also sent 100,000 pounds of food to the communities along the Gulf of Mexico after the April 20, 2010, oil spill. Tyson has supported &quot;Little Free Pantries,&quot; and has partnered with the Chicago Urban League for educational programs on misconceptions about SNAP (food stamp) benefits. Tyson &quot;pledged to invest $50 million by 2020 in various efforts to fight food insecurity&quot; in 2015. The company exceeded that goal, with contributions of over $60 million to start the year 2020.

Tyson Foods has made political donations to both major parties.

===Research and development===

In 2007, Tyson created the Tyson Discovery Center, a R&amp;D center at their headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas, to work on new products and better packaging. They later opened a second Discovery Center in Downers Grove, Illinois.

As of 2017, Tyson has about 300 employees in R&amp;D.

==Environmental record==
Tyson Foods has been responsible for numerous instances of environmental damage. Tyson is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the global food industry. According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Tyson is among the largest single sources of greenhouse gases in the world, when the whole process of rearing animals for slaughter (such as producing feed for the animals and using agriculture chemicals) is considered.

Tyson has been involved in several lawsuits related to air and water pollution. In June 2003, the company admitted to illegally dumping untreated wastewater from its poultry processing plant near Sedalia, Missouri, from 1998 to 2001. The company pleaded guilty to 20 felony violations of the federal Clean Water Act. According to a Department of Justice attorney, the dumping had continued even after the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched the plant in 1999. As part of the plea agreement, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines: $5.5 million to the federal government, $1 million to the state of Missouri, and $1 million to the Missouri Natural Resources Protection Fund. The company also agreed to hire an outside consultant to perform an environmental audit, and institute an &quot;enhanced environmental management system&quot; at the Sedalia plant. At the same time, Tyson also settled a case filed by the Missouri attorney general&#x27;s office related to the same illegal dumping.

In 2002, three residents of Western Kentucky, together with the Sierra Club, filed a lawsuit concerning the discharge of dangerous quantities of ammonia from Tyson&#x27;s Western Kentucky factories. Tyson settled the suit in January 2005, agreeing to spend $500,000 to mitigate and monitor the ammonia levels.

In 2004, Tyson was one of six poultry companies to pay a $7.3 million settlement fee to the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to settle charges that the use of chicken waste as fertilizer had created phosphorus pollution in Tulsa&#x27;s main drinking water sources.

In 2005, Tyson settled a $500,000 lawsuit related to air pollution in Kentucky.

Tyson&#x27;s processing plants generate a vast supply of animal fats. In late 2006, the company created a business unit called Tyson Renewable Energy to examine ways of commercializing the use of this leftover material by converting it into biofuels. The unit also examined the potential use of poultry litter to generate energy and other products.

Tyson&#x27;s 2010 Sustainability Report said that it had reduced water use by 7.6 percent between October 2004 and 2009, and reduced wastewater related permit exceedances by 5.4 percent during 2007–2009. However, the company reported a 51.9 percent increase in violation notices related to wastewater, storm water, and drinking water. The company reduced landfill solid waste by 12.5 percent during 2008–2009.

As of 2010, six of Tyson Foods&#x27; wastewater treatment facilities capture biogas via enclosed anaerobic lagoons. Four of the systems use the biogas as an alternative fuel to natural gas; during 2008–2009, the four facilities used 1.8 billion cubic feet of biogas, replacing 1.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas and saving the company approximately $9.1 million.

According to Tyson&#x27;s 2012 Sustainability Report, the company reduced total water use by 4.7 percent during 2011–2012, but normalized water use increased 1 percent over the same period. Through conservation efforts and closures, the company reduced water use by 10.9 percent between October 2004 and 2012. During 2010–2012, Tyson Foods reduced wastewater related permit exceedances by 48 percent and notices of violations by 86 percent. Tyson reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 8 percent during 2010–2011, and the company cut 145 million truck miles via lightweight equipment purchases, packaging improvements, and use of rail transport.

In 2013, Tyson paid nearly $4 million in fines due to eight separate incidents between 2006 and 2010 where it accidentally released anhydrous ammonia, an extremely hazardous substance which causes chemical-type burns. These releases killed at least one worker and injured nearly a dozen others.

In &quot;Newsweek&quot; 2017 &quot;green ranking&quot;, an environmental performance assessment of the largest public companies, Tyson Foods ranked number 223 in the U.S. and number 312 in the world.

Tyson Foods worked with the World Resources Institute to set a goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2030. The plan was accepted by the Science Based Targets initiative, a coalition of companies working to limit carbon emissions based on the goals of the Paris Agreement.

According to Tyson&#x27;s 2019 Sustainability Report, the company was on track to meet most of its sustainability goals and had decreased water use by 6.8 percent since 2015. Tyson Foods joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2019, and the report also states that the company has goals similar to the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals.

Environmental groups have blamed Tyson for polluting the Illinois River with poultry litter. A company spokesperson said the litter belongs to independent contract farmers and not to Tyson. To address the problem of poultry litter in watersheds, Tyson and four other poultry companies formed the non-profit organization BMPs in 2004. Tyson says that the organization has helped to move more than 1 million tons of poultry litter out of the Illinois River watershed, redistributing the litter to less nutrient-dense areas.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project identified Tyson as being a major discharger of pollution to waterways in East Texas. The high volumes of blood, urine, feces, and feathers discharged into East Texas rivers and lakes contribute to declining oxygen levels in the water, which endanger local animals, fish and habitat. The Environmental Integrity Project found that the Tyson plant in East Texas violated its Clean Water Act permit a dozen times over 2016–2017.

In 2019, wastewater from a Tyson plant in Alabama polluted rivers and killed approximately 175,000 fish. The state of Alabama sued Tyson over the incident the following year.

Also in 2019, Tyson Foods partnered with the Environmental Defense Fund to help farmers reduce nitrogen and erosion across 2 million acres of corn fields in the Midwestern United States and Pennsylvania. The same year, a Tyson building in Springdale, Arkansas, won a LEED silver certification for environmentally friendly design.

As of January 2020, Tyson Foods&#x27; land stewardship and sustainable farming program had enrolled approximately 400,000 acres of corn, and planned to support improved environmental practices on 2 million acres of corn by the end of 2020.

In 2020, Tyson Foods partnered with the nonprofit organization Proforest to complete a deforestation risk assessment, which concluded that approximately 94 percent of the company&#x27;s land footprint is at low risk of being associated with deforestation. To address the remainder found to be at risk, in November the company announced a Forest Protection Standard focused on reducing deforestation risk in supply chains of cattle and beef, soy, palm oil, pulp, paper and packaging.

In 2020, Tyson Foods received a SmartWay Excellence Award from the Environmental Protection Agency, recognizing &quot;top shipping (retailers and manufacturers) and logistics company partners for superior environmental performance&quot;.

In 2020, it was reported that Tyson Foods uses 4.89 million acres of land for soybeans and 5.2 billion acres of corn for providing feed for their 6 million cows, 22 million hogs, and 2 billion chickens. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2018 found that only 5% (408,000 acres) of their land has been enrolled in sustainable practices. This is set to change though as Tyson sets their net zero gas house emissions by 2050. The farm land and fertilizer also have an effect on the environment as potent nitrous oxide is being released. For every one of Tyson&#x27;s 10.1 million acres, fertilizer is being used which can increase the pounds of nitrous oxide per acre in a year from 0.5 to 3 depending on how much fertilizer is being used. Tyson can easily reduce their emissions by 2050 by starting to use less fertilizer and being more precise with their fertilizing.

Tyson doesn&#x27;t directly raise their livestock, as they hire private farms, but they are still responsible for the emissions released from their animals and the feed they use. Tyson is responsible for 6 million cows, which burp methane and release approximately 1.2 billion pounds of methane a year. Tyson also raises chickens and pigs, but they have a much smaller effect on the environment. The main greenhouse gas emissions that come from them are in their manure and are very minuscule compared to those of cows. Tyson has made strides to prevent animal waste being sent to landfills, as 6 of their plants have reached gold status, which means 95-99 percent of their waste is not ending up in a landfill.

In 2024, a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that between 2018 and 2022 Tyson released 371 million pounds of pollutants, including nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, oil, and cyanide, from just 41 slaughterhouses and processing plants into local waterways across the United States.

==Employees==

===Workers&#x27; rights===
According to Celeste Monforton, professor of occupational health at George Washington University, 34 employees were injured at 10 Tyson meatpacking plants during January–September 2015, resulting in one amputation per month on average. Reporting on Monforton&#x27;s findings in 2016, Buzzfeed News said Tyson Foods &quot;recently launched new programs to improve workplace safety communication, awareness and education.&quot;

An Oxfam report issued in 2016 cited anonymous employees who stated they were routinely denied bathroom breaks; they wore adult diapers to work in order to get through the day. In 2017, Tyson Foods announced plans to provide regularly scheduled bathroom breaks and training on workers&#x27; rights for employees, &quot;give more attention to line speeds at plants&quot;, and establish safety councils that involved workers. Additionally, the company announced plans for &quot;hiking wages, publicly sharing results of a third-party audit on worker conditions, increasing benefits to include more vacation and holidays, and expanding existing safety programs&quot;.

The plans stem from compliance audits started in 2012 and an occupational safety and health pilot program established in 2015. The announcement was made in conjunction with Oxfam America and United Food and Commercial Workers. By May 2018, hundreds of Tyson Foods workers at 27 plants had participated in the company&#x27;s Upward Academy education program.

===Employment of illegal immigrants===

Tyson Foods was indicted on December 9, 2001, along with six employees, on charges that it conspired to smuggle illegal immigrants across the Mexican border to work in its processing plants. The 36-count indictment, which was unsealed at Federal District Court in Chattanooga, Tennessee, accused Tyson of arranging to transport illegal immigrant workers across the border and helping them to get counterfeit work papers for jobs at 15 Tyson plants. Prosecutors alleged that the conspiracy to import workers dated back to 1994. Of the six managers who were indicted, two accepted plea bargain deals, and one committed suicide a few months after being charged. In March 2003, a federal jury acquitted Tyson and its managers of having hired illegal immigrants as part of a conspiracy.

In October 2006, a federal judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by Tyson employees who allege that Tyson&#x27;s practice of hiring illegal immigrants depresses wages 10–30%. The suit further contends that the company violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring with National Council of La Raza and League of United Latin American Countries not to question the employment applications of anyone with a Hispanic surname.

===Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic===
As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the United States, officials including the sheriff in Black Hawk County, Iowa criticized Tyson Foods on April 17, 2020, for failing to close a Waterloo, Iowa plant where an outbreak of the disease began. Tyson closed the Waterloo plant on April 22. According to an Associated Press report, the company said the shutdown &quot;would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt the nation&#x27;s meat supply&quot;.
Steve Stouffer, president of the fresh meats division at Tyson Foods, expressed some resistance to universal testing of their workers. &quot;Everybody wants to test meatpacking employees, but nobody is testing the communities around them to show what’s the baseline,&quot; Stouffer said, adding &quot;And until we know the baselines, my question has always been: Are we the cause or are we just the victim of our surroundings?&quot; On April 21, Tyson announced the closure of a plant in Center, Texas, which is located in Shelby County, a rural area with a rate of coronavirus infections about four times higher than the state average. A local physician reported that over half of the county&#x27;s cases were associated with employees of the Tyson facility.

On April 22, Tyson announced the closure of a pork processing plant in Logansport, Indiana. The president of the Indiana Farm Bureau said that the organization is &quot;extremely concerned about the closure of the Tyson pork processing facility. This is a devastating blow to the pork producers who sell hogs to Tyson.&quot; On April 23, Tyson announced that a beef processing plant in Wallula, Washington was closing. Tyson executive Steve Stouffer said, &quot;Unfortunately, the closure will mean reduced food supplies and presents problems to farmers who have no place to take their livestock. It’s a complicated situation across the supply chain.

On April 26, John Tyson, chairman of the board, wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;The food supply chain is breaking...There will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.&quot;

In June 2020, ProPublica reported that well after outbreaks had occurred, Tyson did not implement recommended safety measures to protect its workers, such as physical distancing, plexiglass barriers, and wearing of face masks.

On June 21, the government of China announced that it was suspending imports of chicken from a Tyson factory. The company confirmed that the affected facility was its Berry Street plant in Springdale, Arkansas.

In July 2020, Tyson Foods said it would hire 200 nurses and administrative personnel, and begin administering coronavirus tests at all of its U.S. production facilities, as part of the company&#x27;s response to the pandemic. Tyson&#x27;s Chief Executive Noel White said that the company&#x27;s investment in automation would likely increase in light of the pandemic.

In August 2020, at least 10,261 Tyson workers were confirmed to have COVID-19 (out of a workforce of over 120,000).

In November 2020 a wrongful-death lawsuit previously filed by the family of a Tyson employee, alleging &quot;willful and wanton disregard&quot; for employees&#x27; health and safety with regard to COVID-19, was amended with new allegations that a plant manager had organized a betting pool for supervisor and managers to bet on how many employees would be affected with COVID-19.

In November 2020, Tyson suspended multiple top officials and retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling to conduct an investigation into these allegations. In December 2020, Tyson received the results of the investigation led by former US Attorney General and Covington &amp; Burling partner Eric Holder, and terminated seven of its top managers at the Waterloo, Iowa plant. The Waterloo plant is Tyson&#x27;s largest pork plant and was the centre of a COVID-19 outbreak that infected more than 1000 Tyson employees, killing six, before spreading into the broader community. Tyson did not publicly disclose the names of those terminated or the detailed findings of the report, but issued a statement saying that those terminated did not represent the company&#x27;s core values.

In August 2021, Tyson announced that all employees were required to be &quot;fully vaccinated&quot; with COVID-19 vaccines by November. The company offered employees a $200 incentive to get vaccinated. The mandate was suspended on October 31, 2022.

==Production==

===Use of antibiotics===

In 2007, Tyson began labeling and advertising its chicken products as &quot;raised without antibiotics&quot;. Tyson competitors Perdue Farms and Sanderson Farms sued, claiming that Tyson&#x27;s claim violated truth-in-advertising/labeling standards. Tyson acknowledged using ionophores in chicken feed. Ionophores are used to control coccidiosis, a parasite common in poultry, and the medication is not used in human medicine. A federal judge ordered Tyson to stop making the &quot;raised without antibiotics&quot; claim by May 15, 2008.

In June 2008, USDA inspectors discovered that Tyson had also been using gentamicin, an antibiotic, in unhatched eggs. USDA spokespeople stated that Tyson had not disclosed the use of this antibiotic to the agency, and they issued a letter informing Tyson that the &quot;raised without antibiotics&quot; claim was not truthful. A Tyson spokesperson acknowledged that the company uses the antibiotic and stated that its use is standard industry practice.

The USDA had originally approved the &quot;raised without antibiotics&quot; label, but withdrew their approval after learning that Tyson used ionophores. Tyson and the USDA compromised on rewording Tyson&#x27;s slogan as &quot;raised without antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans&quot;, but the USDA later said that Tyson could not use that label either. In June 2008, Tyson agreed to voluntarily remove its &quot;raised without antibiotics&quot; label in future packaging and advertising.

In 2015, Tyson Foods announced plans to stop feeding chickens with antibiotics used in human medicine. In 2017, the company announced plans to stop using antibiotics on chickens for Tyson-branded breasts, nuggets, and wings.

===Animal welfare===
Tyson Foods has been embroiled in numerous scandals related to animal abuse and cruelty. In response to undercover revelations of animal abuse, Tyson has responded by arguing that the undercover animal rights activists were at fault for the abuse by not actively preventing it.

In 2006, Tyson completed a study to determine whether controlled atmosphere killing, which uses gas to render chickens unconscious before slaughter, could be a more humane practice than conventional electrical stunning. According to Bill Lovette, Tyson&#x27;s senior group vice president of poultry and prepared foods, the study found no difference between the humaneness of the two methods. The company plans to ask scientists at the University of Arkansas to initiate a similar study to test these initial results. The research will be led by the newly created chair in Food Animal Wellbeing at the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences of the University of Arkansas. Tyson has committed $1.5 million to help establish the chair, which will be involved in overseeing research and classes focused on the humane management and treatment of food animals.

In 2012, Tyson introduced an auditing program known as FarmCheck to check how animals are treated by the company&#x27;s suppliers. The program was introduced as a trial on certain hog farms, and was the first major program of its kind to apply penalties to producers for noncompliance. By 2020, FarmCheck had expanded to Tyson&#x27;s poultry suppliers, and its poultry audits were certified by the Professional Animal Auditor Certification Organization.

In 2014, after an NBC News reported on abuse of piglets at a Tyson pig farm in Oklahoma, Tyson announced new animal care guidelines, such as keeping sows in larger cages, installing video cameras in cages, using pain mitigation strategies in the castration of piglets, and avoiding killing piglets through blunt force. Animal rights activities called on Tyson to make the guidelines a &quot;mandate&quot; rather than a &quot;recommendation.&quot;

In 2015, Tyson Foods severed ties with a supplier after Mercy For Animals published videos showing that employees at a Tyson supplier were stabbing, clubbing and stomping on chickens. A 2016 undercover investigation by the animal rights organization Compassion Over Killing showed workers at four separate Tyson processing plants throwing, punching and kicking chickens, as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks. They also wrung birds&#x27; necks, ran over them with forklifts, and left injured birds in heaping piles to die.

A 2017 investigation showed more abuse and cruelty towards chickens. After the 2017 investigation, Tyson responded by saying it would introduce a remote video auditing system to monitor treatment of chickens in its supply chain and hire off-site auditors. The company also started a pilot program for controlled atmosphere stunning, considered to be a more humane method of slaughter. Animal rights activists said the measure did not go far enough. In 2017, Matthew Prescott of the Humane Society of the United States criticized Tyson for failing to implement many of the animal welfare standards that other food suppliers were adopting.

In 2020, Tyson worked with the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture to investigate the effects of lighting on broiler chicken welfare. Their research project, &quot;Effect of Variable Light Intensity Program on Broiler Gait Score, Stress and Central Positive Welfare in Commercial Broiler Farm&quot;, received a $110,000 grant from the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association.

Following a 2020 complaint, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Tyson for making false and misleading advertising claims regarding the treatment of its chickens.

===Food recalls===
On January 30, 2019, Tyson Foods announced a recall for over 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets that were at risk of being contaminated with small pieces of rubber. The recall followed allegations by consumers who submitted complaints to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Tyson identified the contaminated nuggets as those received by Arizona, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Utah club store distribution centers. On March 21, 2019, the company issued a recall for 69,000 pounds of chicken strips potentially contaminated with pieces of metal, following six complaints submitted to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, including three alleged oral injuries. An expanded recall for nearly 12 million pounds of chicken strips was issued on May 4, 2019.

On June 7, 2019, Tyson Foods announced a recall for over 190,000 pounds of chicken fritters which potentially contained hard plastic following reports from three consumers. The products were not sold in retail stores but supplied to various food service locations, including schools.

On July 3, 2021, Tyson Foods announced a recall for approximately 8,955,296 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken products that may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes. These frozen, fully cooked chicken products were produced between December 26, 2020, and April 13, 2021.

==Price manipulation==

In 2016, Maplevale sued Tyson and other poultry producers for alleged price fixing. Since the original filing, numerous other customers and consumers have filed similar lawsuits, which are consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. The companies were accused of working together to restrict the supply of chickens and to manipulate chicken prices; these activities allegedly started in 2008. Tyson has denied the allegations, with a spokesperson calling them &quot;baseless&quot;.

In June 2020, Tyson announced it was cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in relation to price fixing and bid rigging in the poultry industry. Tyson was cooperating under a leniency program whereby it would avoid criminal prosecution by providing aid to DOJ investigators. Just prior to the announcement, four poultry industry executives were indicted for conspiracy to engage in price fixing. In October 2020, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride agreed to a plea agreement and a settlement of $110 million. In March 2021, Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million to poultry buyers to settle the price-fixing claims.

In 2024, McDonald&#x27;s Corporation sued JBS, National Beef, Cargill, and Tyson, along with their subsidiaries, for alleged price fixing.

<text>The Peace Race (, , , (), , , , ) is a cycling race that was established as the largest event in Eastern Europe after the Second World War. Since 2013, it has been run as one of the most prestigious stage races for national U23 teams.

== History ==
At the outset, due to the political situation, it was a nominally &quot;amateur&quot; event, which therefore excluded participation of Western cycling stars. Nevertheless, the organisers were able to give the event an international character thanks to the start of competitors from the Eastern Bloc sphere. Workers&#x27; organisations from Italy, France and Finland also sent their representatives. In Prague, forty-five years after the first edition of the Tour de France, seven teams set off to Poland, and ten from Warsaw.

The race was officially called Slavjantour and took place between Prague and Warsaw. It was actually two races. A seven-stage race starting in Prague and a five-stage race from Warsaw. That first year, 53 competitors set off from Prague to cover 1,106 kilometres; 39 of them reached Warsaw after the seven stages. In the opposite direction, the course measured 880 km and 65 riders attempted to cover the five sections, although only 52 arrived in Prague. The winner&#x27;s yellow jersey, modelled on the Tour de France, was claimed by Yugoslavs in both destination cities: in Prague Alexander Zorič (35:53.16 hours and an average speed of 30.7 km/h), in Warsaw Augustin Prosenik (26:52.25 hours, 32.4 km/h).

It was not until 1950 that the official name was changed to the Peace Race.

Gradually, the race gained in popularity and repute, although it remained open only to amateurs and state-funded Soviet Bloc cyclists. From 1952, East Germany was added to the host countries and the races took place between Prague, Berlin and Warsaw. The opening stage starting locations and the finish line of the final stage alternated. In the eighties, the then Soviet Union was also included in the list of host countries.

After the break-up of the Czechoslovak Federation in the spring of 1993, the race remained almost exclusively in the territory of the Czech Republic. Thirteen years later the final edition of the Peace Race took place. Financial problems caused the collapse of the organisation.

Steffen Wesemann of Germany has the most victories in the history of the Peace Race. However, his five triumphs date to the period after 1989, when the Velvet Revolution took place in Czechoslovakia. Pole Ryszard Szurkowski and German Uwe Ampler can each boast four victories in the Peace Race.

German Olaf Ludwig was the absolute king among the sprinters, and he dominated the points competition eight times. Ryszard Szurkowski won three overall victories. In the mountain climbing competition, the best with three victories each are Sergej Suchoruchenkov from the then Soviet Union, Uwe Ampler and Czech competitor, Jaroslav Bílek.

Czech and Czechoslovakian cyclists have also left an indelible mark in history of the Peace Race. Victory was celebrated by Jan Veselý (1949), Jan Smolík (1964), Vlastimil Moravec (1972), Ján Svorada (1990), Jaroslav Bílek (1993), Pavel Padrnos (1995) and Ondřej Sosenka (2002).

===Legacy===
In April/May, 2012 Alan Buttler organised a re-run of the 1955 Peace Race as a tribute to his father, Alf Buttler, who was the GB cycling team mechanic for many events in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He was joined by former peace riders including Gustav-Adolf Schur, Geoff Wiles, John Woodburn, Alan Jacob, and Axel Peschel.

There is a museum in Kleinmühlingen in Germany dedicated to the Peace Race.

===Junior Peace Race===
A Junior Peace Race was first held in 1965 and held again the following year. After a hiatus it was revived in 1974 and has been held every year since, continuing after the senior race was no longer organised. Several riders who won the junior race have gone on to senior success, including Roman Kreuziger Sr., Roman Kreuziger Jr., Denis Menchov, Fabian Cancellara, Peter Velits, Tanel Kangert and Michal Kwiatkowski.

===Peace Race U23===
2013 saw a revival of the race, but in a completely different format. It became a race for national teams of cyclists under 23 years old. Since the 2015 season it has been part of the prestigious Nations Cup series. 

Initially the race had just three stages, but this was expanded to four stages in the fourth year of the race. Past years have seen stars of the current world peloton, such as Tadej Pogačar, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Julian Alaphilippe and Marc Hirschi, lined up at the start of the race.

The Peace Race U23 is ridden over exceptionally demanding courses in the Jeseníky hills, which makes it the perfect proving ground for World Tour candidates. 

&quot;Every year we see young talents on the Peace Race who will soon appear on the rosters of elite division teams. Individual national teams send their best cyclists to the Peace Race. The stages of our race are regularly praised for revealing the strengths of the riders. Without exaggeration, we can say that it is a race comparable to those somewhere in the Pyrenees or the Alps,&quot; says Leopold König, director of the Under-23 Peace Race.

<doc id="1100216" wikidata="Q410395" url="?curid=1100216" title="Sphingolipid">
<text>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid bases, which are a set of aliphatic amino alcohols that includes sphingosine. They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transduction and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with a terminal hydroxyl group is a ceramide. Other common groups bonded to the terminal oxygen atom include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids.

==Structure==
The long-chain bases, sometimes simply known as sphingoid bases, are the first non-transient products of &quot;de novo&quot; sphingolipid synthesis in both yeast and mammals. These compounds, specifically known as phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (also known as sphinganine, although this term is less common), are mainly C18 compounds, with somewhat lower levels of C20 bases. Ceramides and glycosphingolipids are &quot;N&quot;-acyl derivatives of these compounds.

The sphingosine backbone is O-linked to a (usually) charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline.

The backbone is also amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid.

==Types==
Simple sphingolipids, which include the sphingoid bases and ceramides, make up the early products of the sphingolipid synthetic pathways.
* Sphingoid bases are the fundamental building blocks of all sphingolipids. The main mammalian sphingoid bases are dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine, while dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine are the principal sphingoid bases in yeast. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine may be phosphorylated.
* Ceramides, as a general class, are &quot;N&quot;-acylated sphingoid bases lacking additional head groups. 
**Dihydroceramide is produced by &quot;N&quot;-acylation of dihydrosphingosine. Dihydroceramide is found in both yeast and mammalian systems.
**Ceramide is produced in mammalian systems by desaturation of dihydroceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1). This highly bioactive molecule may also be phosphorylated to form ceramide-1-phosphate.
**Phytoceramide is produced in yeast by hydroxylation of dihydroceramide at C-4.

Complex sphingolipids may be formed by addition of head groups to ceramide or phytoceramide: 
* Sphingomyelins have a phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine molecule with an ester linkage to the 1-hydroxy group of a ceramide.
* Glycosphingolipids are ceramides with one or more sugar residues joined in a β-glycosidic linkage at the 1-hydroxyl position (see image).
** Cerebrosides have a single glucose or galactose at the 1-hydroxy position.
*** Sulfatides are sulfated cerebrosides.
** Gangliosides have at least three sugars, one of which must be sialic acid.
* Inositol-containing ceramides, which are derived from phytoceramide, are produced in yeast. These include inositol phosphorylceramide, mannose inositol phosphorylceramide, and mannose diinositol phosphorylceramide.

== Mammalian sphingolipid metabolism ==
&quot;De novo&quot; sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. However, studies have demonstrated that serine palmitoyltransferase has some activity toward other species of fatty acyl-CoA and alternative amino acids, and the diversity of sphingoid bases has recently been reviewed. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by one of six (dihydro)-ceramide synthase, CerS - originally termed LASS - to form dihydroceramide. The six CerS enzymes have different specificity for acyl-CoA substrates, resulting in the generation of dihydroceramides with differing chain lengths (ranging from C14-C26). Dihydroceramides are then desaturated to form ceramide.

De novo generated ceramide is the central hub of the sphingolipid network and subsequently has several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is generated by this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. This may be dephosphorylated to reform sphingosine.

Breakdown pathways allow the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to form ceramide.

The only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non-sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.

== Functions of mammalian sphingolipids ==

Sphingolipids are commonly believed to protect the cell surface against harmful environmental factors by forming a mechanically stable and chemically resistant outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Certain complex glycosphingolipids were found to be involved in specific functions, such as cell recognition and signaling. Cell recognition depends mainly on the physical properties of the sphingolipids, whereas signaling involves specific interactions of the glycan structures of glycosphingolipids with similar lipids present on neighboring cells or with proteins.

Recently, simple sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been shown to be important mediators in the signaling cascades involved in apoptosis, proliferation, stress responses, necrosis, inflammation, autophagy, senescence, and differentiation. Ceramide-based lipids self-aggregate in cell membranes and form separate phases less fluid than the bulk phospholipids. These sphingolipid-based microdomains, or &quot;lipid rafts&quot; were originally proposed to sort membrane proteins along the cellular pathways of membrane transport. At present, most research focuses on the organizing function during signal transduction.

Sphingolipids are synthesized in a pathway that begins in the ER and is completed in the Golgi apparatus, but these lipids are enriched in the plasma membrane and in endosomes, where they perform many of their functions. Transport occurs via vesicles and monomeric transport in the cytosol. Sphingolipids are virtually absent from mitochondria and the ER, but constitute a 20-35 molar fraction of plasma membrane lipids.

In experimental animals, feeding sphingolipids inhibits colon carcinogenesis, reduces LDL cholesterol and elevates HDL cholesterol.

== Other sphingolipids ==
Sphingolipids are universal in eukaryotes but are rare in bacteria and archaea, meaning that they are evolutionally very old. Bacteria that do produce sphingolipids are found in some members of the superphylum FCB group (Sphingobacteria), particularly family Sphingomonadaceae, some members of the Bdellovibrionota, and some members of the Myxococcota.

=== Yeast sphingolipids ===

Because of the incredible complexity of mammalian systems, yeast are often used as a model organism for working out new pathways. These single-celled organisms are often more genetically tractable than mammalian cells, and strain libraries are available to supply strains harboring almost any non-lethal open reading frame single deletion. The two most commonly used yeasts are &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, although research is also done in the pathogenic yeast &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.

In addition to the important structural functions of complex sphingolipids (inositol phosphorylceramide and its mannosylated derivatives), the sphingoid bases phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) play vital signaling roles in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. These effects include regulation of endocytosis, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (and, thus, regulation of nutrient uptake ), cytoskeletal dynamics, the cell cycle, translation, posttranslational protein modification, and the heat stress response. Additionally, modulation of sphingolipid metabolism by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate signaling &quot;via&quot; Slm1p and Slm2p and calcineurin has recently been described. Additionally, a substrate-level interaction has been shown between complex sphingolipid synthesis and cycling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by the phosphatidylinositol kinase Stt4p and the lipid phosphatase Sac1p.

===Plant sphingolipids===
Higher plants contain a wider variety of sphingolipids than animals and fungi.

==Disorders==

There are several disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, known as sphingolipidoses. The main members of this group are Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, Gaucher disease, Tay–Sachs disease and Metachromatic leukodystrophy. They are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, but notably Fabry disease is X-linked. Taken together, sphingolipidoses have an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000, but substantially more in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews. Enzyme replacement therapy is available to treat mainly Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, and people with these types of sphingolipidoses may live well into adulthood. The other types are generally fatal by age 1 to 5 years for infantile forms, but progression may be mild for juvenile- or adult-onset forms.

Sphingolipids have also been implicated with the frataxin protein (Fxn), the deficiency of which is associated with Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia (FRDA). Loss of Fxn in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA. Other research has demonstrated that iron accumulation in the nervous systems of flies enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors.

Sphingolipids play a key role in neuronal survival in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease (PD) and their catabolic pathway alteration in the brain is partly represented in cerebrospinal fluid and blood tissues (Table1) and have the diagnostic potential.

<doc id="1100217" wikidata="Q4992455" url="?curid=1100217" title="Hey Nostradamus!">
<text>Hey Nostradamus! is a novel by Douglas Coupland centred on a fictional 1988 school shooting in suburban Vancouver, British Columbia and its aftermath. It was first published by Random House of Canada in 2003. The novel comprises four first-person narratives, each from the perspective of a character directly or indirectly affected by the shooting. The novel intertwines substantial themes, including adolescent love, sex, religion, prayer and grief.

==Plot synopsis==

The novel follows the stories of victims of a fictional school shooting in North Vancouver in 1988. Coupland has expressed his concern that the killers of the Columbine High School massacre received more focus than the victims; this is his story about the victims of tragedy. The novel is told in four parts, each with a different narrator and focus.

===1988: Cheryl===
Cheryl Anway, the seventeen-year-old victim of a shooting massacre at her high school at Delbrook Senior Secondary, recounts her life from a liminal state where she is dead but can still hear the prayers and curses of those who are alive. 

Cheryl was pregnant, having recently consummated her relationship with her long-term boyfriend, Jason, after they married in Las Vegas. Cheryl and Jason are members of a group of young Christians.

During the shooting, Cheryl is trapped under a table in the cafeteria. While the killers make their way through the crowd, one of them decides that he has had enough of the killing and wants to stop. The other killers decide that he has become weak, and kill him. They then turn their attention to Cheryl and her friends, and Cheryl becomes the final casualty. Before Cheryl is murdered, she witnesses Jason killing one of the gunman with a rock, enabling the other students to subdue and kill the final gunman.

===1999: Jason===
Eleven years after the massacre, Jason struggles to cope with life. He writes a letter to his twin nephews, born after the death of his older brother, Kent.

Jason works as a carpenter with no true friends, frequently drinking and occasionally blacking out. He reveals that after he killed one of the school shooters, his father Reg was angry with him and his alcoholic mother left Reg. Jason was investigated by the police and was devastated when his Christian friends and Cheryl&#x27;s family turn against him. He is eventually cleared and his mother takes him to New Brunswick to recuperate. 

During one of his present-day drinking binges, Jason blacks out and comes to in an isolated location aware that he is about to be murdered by Yorgos, a friend of his boss. Jason defends himself and is able to escape from Yorgos; rather than kill him, however, Jason leaves him injured and sends help to him. 

At the end of his letter, Jason reveals to his nephews that after Kent died, his widow Barb asked Jason to impregnate her so that she could pass the child off as Kent&#x27;s. Jason agreed under the condition that Barb marry him; they did so in Las Vegas, mimicking the conditions under which he married Cheryl. During their trip to Vegas, they are spotted by an acquaintance whom Barb later murders to protect her secret. Nine months later the twins are born.

===2002: Heather===
A court reporter, Heather is in distress after her boyfriend Jason goes missing. 

She receives a call from a woman named Allison claiming to be a fake psychic who has had a real vision. Allison uses a secret language that is personal to Heather and Jason, making Heather believe that Jason is trying to contact her. 

Despite claiming not to want money, Allison begins to extort money from Heather to pass on her messages. Heather decides to try to track down Allison and learns she is named Cecilia. She sees Cecilia with a young woman with whom she believes Jason had been having an affair. When Heather confronts the woman, she reveals she is Cecilia&#x27;s daughter. Her mother came to know of the secret language because Jason came to her with detailed notes, wanting to pass along the information if he ever went missing. 

Heather is left wondering about Jason&#x27;s past, unaware that his decision was prompted by a chance meeting with Yorgos.

===2003: Reg===
Reg writes an open letter to his son, lamenting that he was a harsh and abusive father under the guise of being a Christian for most of Jason&#x27;s childhood. 

Reg repents of the way he treated both Jason and Kent, and regrets that he destroyed his relationship with a woman named Ruth because he would not divorce Jason&#x27;s mother. He reveals that though Jason is still missing the RCMP located a shirt of his in the woods and Reg plans to post copies of his letter to trees hoping that somehow Jason will be able to read it.

==Characters==

; Cheryl
: A grade 12 student who is a victim of the Delbrook Secondary School massacre. Cheryl grew up in a non-religious environment but becomes religious through her pursuit of Jason. Her family are agnostic and dislike her newfound faith. Cheryl is the last fatality, before Jason kills one of the gunmen. Her story alternates between her former life and current oblivion. Jason and Cheryl wed in Las Vegas. She informs Jason that she is pregnant with his child, just a few hours before the massacre occurs.
; Jason
: A quiet and rebellious child from a very religious family, Jason is narrates the second section of the novel. His father, Reg, is self-righteous, zealous, and unapologetic, and seems to favour his older brother Kent.
; Reg
: Reg is the narrator of the fourth part of the novel. Born to a strict father, Reg turned to belief as his salvation. Creating a very strict religious code for himself, Reg married and became the father to two children, Kent and Jason. Kent was his father&#x27;s child, following in his father&#x27;s religious footsteps. During the novel, Reg transforms from a narrow fundamentalist mindset to become more open and loving.
; Jason&#x27;s mother
: Jason&#x27;s mother married Reg due to his strong beliefs. She leaves Reg after he casts out Jason, and takes Jason across Canada. She eventually succumbs to alcohol-induced dementia.
; Kent
: Jason&#x27;s older brother. He is a leader of a Christian movement and is Reg&#x27;s favourite son. Kent is married to Barb, and has two twin sons with her. He dies in a car accident in the second part of the novel.
; Barb
: Kent&#x27;s wife, but she is the mother of Jason&#x27;s twin sons, therefore Kent&#x27;s nephews. She and Kent tried to have kids but it didn&#x27;t work. Since she was desperate to have kids, and Kent dies, she forces Jason to have sex with her, hoping the child will look like Kent. After a fallout with Reg, she remains close to Jason until his disappearance.
; Heather
: Jason&#x27;s romantic partner in the latter half of the novel, Heather is another narrator. She feels distant and is brought back into the world, just as she brings out Jason from his emotional seclusion. She creates characters and stories with Jason, which are later provided back to her by a psychic, who Heather believes will bring her back to the missing Jason.

==Inspiration==
Coupland began to write the novel in December 2001, after a &quot;nightmarish 40-city tour&quot; of the United States that allowed him to experience the country&#x27;s &quot;collective sorrow&quot;. He began to research the events of the Columbine massacre after this experience.

The quotation from Corinthians that opens the novel was found on a gravestone of a child who died in a high school shooting.

==History of the novel==
The novel was an international best-seller and was received well by critics.

The novel was released the same week as Gus Van Sant&#x27;s film &quot;Elephant&quot;, which also dealt with a Columbine-like situation.

Coupland also had an art installation on the same topic, called &quot;Tropical Birds&quot;, which featured 3D versions of the kneeling figure from the front cover of &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot;, and other pieces which features scenes from a school shooting tragedy.

<doc id="1100220" wikidata="Q5474926" url="?curid=1100220" title="Four-minute warning">
<text>The four-minute warning was a public alert system conceived by the British Government during the Cold War and operated between 1953 and 1992. The name derived from the approximate length of time from the point at which a Soviet nuclear missile attack against the United Kingdom could be confirmed and the impact of those missiles on their targets. 

== The warning system ==

=== Basic details ===
The warning would be initiated by the detection of inbound missiles and aircraft targeted at the United Kingdom. Early in the Cold War, Jodrell Bank was used to detect and track incoming missiles, while continuing to be used for astronomical research.

Throughout the Cold War, there was a conflict between the Royal Air Force and the Home Office about who was in charge of the warning system. This was not for any practical or technical reason but more to do with who would be blamed if a false alarm were given or if an attack occurred without warning. By the 1980s, the warning was to be given on the orders of a Warning Officer from the Home Office&#x27;s Warning and Monitoring Organisation stationed at RAF Booker near High Wycombe.

From the early 1960s, initial detection of attack would be provided primarily by the RAF BMEWS station at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. There, powerful radar would track the inbound missiles and allow confirmation of targets. In later years the first indication of any imminent attack would be expected to come from infrared detectors aboard the United States Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. BMEWS would still play an important role in tracking and confirming the destination of any launches.

The British government was not the main beneficiary of BMEWS, given that it would only receive what Solly Zuckerman described in 1960 as &quot;no more than 5 minutes warning time&quot; of an attack. The United States was the United Kingdom&#x27;s most important military and technological partner, and its US-based Strategic Air Command would have thirty minutes warning from the Fylingdales station, whilst the RAF&#x27;s own V bomber force would have about ten minutes.

=== UKWMO and the ROC ===
It was the responsibility of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Centre (UK RAOC) located at RAF Booker to alert the nation to an imminent air attack. Once an alert was initiated the national and local television and radio networks would break into transmissions and broadcast a warning (the warning message would originate from an emergency studio in BBC Broadcasting House in London). Simultaneously the national air raid siren system would be brought into service. A system, which used the same frequency on normal telephone lines as the peacetime speaking clock, was employed for this whereby a key switch activation alerted 250 national Carrier Control Points or CCPs present in police stations across the country. In turn the CCPs would, via a signal carried along ordinary phone lines, cause 7,000 powered sirens to start up. In rural areas, around 11,000 hand powered sirens would be operated by postmasters, rural police officers, or Royal Observer Corps personnel (even parish priests, publicans, magistrates, subpostmasters or private citizens could be involved in some remote rural areas).

Linked into the system were the twenty-five Royal Observer Corps (ROC) group controls, also with direct links to the carrier control points. In the event of subsequent radioactive fallout, local fallout warnings could be generated from the group controls on a very localised basis over the same carrier wave system.

The national warning system saw many changes over the years. During the 1960s and 1970s, much of the local authority civil defence planning in the United Kingdom became outdated, although the WB400/WB600 warning system was maintained and kept serviceable along with updating of ROC instrumentation and communications. The system&#x27;s main problem was that many of the telephone lines it needed had to be manually switched in times of pre-war tension by Post Office telephone engineers. The links were not hardened against the effects of EMP. In the late 1970s and early 1980s heightened fears and tensions led to a resumption of contingency planning and the upgrading of many systems. The outdated WB400/WB600 systems were replaced with brand new WB1400 equipment, communications links were made permanent and hardened against EMP disruption.

=== Sirens ===
The national siren system originating from World War II had a secondary role of &quot;general warning&quot;, particularly for imminent flooding. Following the end of the Cold War, a telephone-based system was thought to be more appropriate for national warnings and less expensive to maintain.

Additionally the government retains an ability to break into television and radio broadcasts for the purpose of alerting the general public and has legal power to take over editorial control of the BBC during a national emergency under the BBC Charter and the Broadcasting Act 1980.

The national siren system was largely dismantled during the 1990s. The British government cited the increasing use of double-glazed windows (which make sirens harder to hear) and the reduced likelihood of air attack as reasons to eliminate the system in most parts of the country. Some coastal and river areas have retained and regularly test the sirens as part of the flood warning defences. Since 1952, Broadmoor Hospital has employed a network of 13 sirens to warn of escaped patients; this is tested every Monday at 10 am. The hospital sirens were scheduled for removal during 2018 except for one located in the hospital grounds. Carstairs Hospital also retains its sirens, which are tested monthly. In some towns, sirens were once used to summon part-time firemen until the introduction of radio pagers during the 1970s – these stand-alone sirens operated independently of the warning network.

Torness nuclear power station in East Lothian Scotland uses two of these sirens as a warning of an off-site nuclear emergency, tested every Tuesday morning at 10.

The following is a script that would have been broadcast in the aftermath of an attack, available from the BBC:

== Cultural impact ==
The Cold War and the fear of nuclear attack permeated pop culture up until the 1990s. Examples include the song &quot;Four Minute Warning&quot; by the British punk band Chaos UK (EP &quot;Burning Britain&quot;, 1982), the poem &quot;Your Attention Please&quot; by Peter Porter, a solo song by Take That singer, Mark Owen, and &quot;Four Minutes&quot; by Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd fame) on his 1987 solo album &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;. John Paul Jones has a song entitled &quot;4-Minute Warning&quot; on the 1988 Brian Eno album &quot;Music for Films III&quot;. The first single of the UK rap crew Gunshot, from 1990, was entitled &quot;Battle Creek Brawl (4 Minute Warning)&quot;. A Radiohead track from the 2007 Bonus Disc album &quot;In Rainbows&quot; Disk 2 is titled &quot;4 Minute Warning&quot;.

The four-minute warning was a central plot and narrative device in dramas (both on stage and screen) and novels, often being the motor force of plays, films, novels and cartoon strips. The BBC drama &quot;Threads&quot;, about how society decays after a nuclear holocaust, focuses on an attack on Sheffield. &quot;The War Game&quot; also portrays the four-minute warning, pointing out the warning period could be even less. The narrator, Michael Aspel, says it could even be two-and-a-half to three minutes between issuing the warning and impact on a target, or less than 30 seconds for a SLBM attack. The film adaptation of Raymond Briggs&#x27;s satirical and blackly comic cartoon strip, &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;, has the warning message as part of the script, which triggers arguing between Jim and Hilda Bloggs. Although this is not Peter Donaldson&#x27;s pre-recorded warning (which was not available on grounds of national security and for copyright reasons), this was a fictional announcement written on grounds of artistic licence. It was read by Robin Houston, a voiceover artist who was known in London as a newsreader for Thames Television (who played the role of newsreader in the film).

The adult humour comic &quot;Viz&quot; ran a photo strip in its issue 107 called &quot;Four Minutes to Fall in Love&quot;, where a boyfriend and girlfriend cram a whole relationship into the four minutes before a nuclear attack. The four-minute warning had become the inspiration for many jokes and sketches in comedy programmes in Britain, in the same way that the Emergency Broadcast System had in the United States (see nuclear weapons in popular culture). In one episode of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;The Russians Are Coming,&quot; Delboy and Rodney Trotter sell fallout shelter kits and have an attack drill. Driving towards their shelter, they are stopped by the police for speeding and asked: &quot;You just heard the four-minute warning?&quot; After being sent on their way, Rodney points out: &quot;We died forty-five seconds ago.&quot; Around the same time, a sketch on the BBC Scotland programme &quot;Naked Video&quot; had a mock announcement warning of an attack with a punchline of &quot;...except for viewers in Scotland.&quot;

<doc id="1100228" wikidata="Q639140" url="?curid=1100228" title="Outrigger boat">
<text>Outrigger boats are various watercraft featuring one or more lateral support floats known as outriggers, which are fastened to one or both sides of the main hull. They can range from small dugout canoes to large plank-built vessels. Outrigger boats can also vary in their configuration, from the ancestral double-hull configuration (catamarans), to single-outrigger vessels prevalent in the Pacific Islands and Madagascar, to the double-outrigger vessels (trimarans) prevalent in Island Southeast Asia. They are traditionally fitted with Austronesian sails, like the crab claw sails and tanja sails, but in modern times are often fitted with petrol engines.

Unlike a single-hulled vessel, an outrigger or double-hull vessel generates stability as a result of the distance between its hulls rather than due to the shape of each individual hull. As such, the hulls of outrigger or double-hull boats are typically longer, narrower and more hydrodynamically efficient than those of single-hull vessels. Compared to other types of canoes, smaller outrigger canoes can be quite fast, yet are also capable of being paddled and sailed in rougher water. This paddling technique, however, differs greatly from kayaking or rowing. The paddle, or blade, used by the paddler is single sided, with either a straight or a double-bend shaft.

These vessels were the first true ocean-going ships, and are an important part of the Austronesian heritage. They were the vessels that enabled the Austronesian expansion from Taiwan into the islands of both the Indian and Pacific Ocean from around 3000 BC. They comprise the bulk of traditional boats in Island Southeast Asia, Island Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. They have spread to other cultures Austronesians came into contact with, notably in Sri Lanka and southern India as well as in the coast of East Africa. In modern times, outrigger vessels are used in the sport of sailing. Catamaran and trimaran configurations are also widely used for high speed craft.
==History==
Outrigger boats were originally developed by the Austronesian-speaking peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia for sea travel. It is believed that the use of outriggers may have been initially caused by the need for stability on small watercraft after the invention of crab claw sails some time around 1500 BCE.

Outrigger boats were essential in the transportation of Austronesians both eastward to Polynesia and New Zealand and westward across the Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar during the Austronesian migration period. The Austronesian peoples (Malagasy, Maritime Southeast Asian, Micronesian, Melanesian, Taiwanese indigenous peoples, and Polynesian peoples) continue to be the primary users of the outrigger boats.
The simplest form of all ancestral Austronesian boats had five parts. The bottom part consists of single piece of hollowed-out log. At the sides were two planks, and two horseshoe-shaped wood pieces formed the prow and stern. These were &quot;sewn&quot; together with dowels and lashings. They had no central rudders but were instead steered using an oar on one side. The ancestral rig was the mastless triangular crab claw sail which had two booms that could be tilted to the wind. These were built in the double-canoe configuration or had a single outrigger on the windward side. In Island Southeast Asia, these developed into double outriggers on each side that provided greater stability. The triangular crab claw sails also later developed into square or rectangular tanja sails, which like crab claw sails, had booms spanning the upper and lower edges. Fixed masts also developed later in both Southeast Asia (usually as bipod or tripod masts) and Oceania.

Early researchers like Heine-Geldern (1932) and Hornell (1943) once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger boats, but modern authors specializing in Austronesian cultures like Doran (1981) and Mahdi (1988) now believe it to be the opposite.

Two canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together. Over time, the double-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe, where one hull is smaller than the other. Eventually the smaller hull became the prototype outrigger, giving way to the single outrigger canoe, which diverged into the reversible single outrigger canoe in Oceania. Finally, the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe (or trimarans).

This would also explain why older Austronesian populations in Island Southeast Asia tend to favor double outrigger boats, as it keeps the boats stable when tacking. But they still have small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger boats are still used. In contrast, more distant outlying descendant populations in Micronesia, Polynesia, Madagascar, and the Comoros retained the double-hull and the single outrigger boat types, for the technology of double outriggers never reached them (exceptions being western Melanesia). To deal with the problem of the instability of the boat when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking, they instead developed the shunting technique in sailing, in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers.

When Magellan&#x27;s ships first encountered the Chamorros of the Mariana Islands in 1521, Antonio Pigafetta recorded that the Chamorros&#x27; sailboats far surpassed Magellan&#x27;s in speed and maneuverability. Similarly, the Spanish priest Francisco Combés, describing the large &quot;karakoa&quot; outrigger warships of the Visayan Islands in the Philippines, remarked:

Outrigger fishing canoes are also used among certain non-Austronesian groups, such as the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, where they are known as &quot;oruwa&quot;, as well as among some groups in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They can also be found in East Africa (e.g., the &quot;ungalawa&quot; of Tanzania).

The acquisition of the catamaran and outrigger boat technology by the non-Austronesian peoples in Sri Lanka and southern India is the result of very early Austronesian contact with the region, including the Maldives and Laccadive Islands. This is estimated to have occurred around 1000 to 600 BCE and onwards. This may have possibly included limited colonization that have since been assimilated. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, Tamil &quot;paṭavu&quot;, Telugu &quot;paḍava&quot;, and Kannada &quot;paḍahu&quot;, all meaning &quot;ship&quot;, are all derived from Proto-Hesperonesian &quot;*padaw&quot;, &quot;sailboat&quot;, with Austronesian cognates like Javanese &quot;perahu&quot;, Kadazan &quot;padau&quot;, Maranao &quot;padaw&quot;, Cebuano &quot;paráw&quot;, Samoan &quot;folau&quot;, Hawaiian &quot;halau&quot;, and Māori &quot;wharau&quot;.

The technology has persisted into the modern age. Outrigger boats can be quite large fishing or transport vessels. In the Philippines, outrigger boats (called &quot;bangka&quot; or &quot;paraw&quot;) are often fitted with petrol engines. The links between seafaring and outrigger boats in the Philippines extend through to political life, in which the smallest political unit in the country is still called &quot;barangay&quot; after the historical &quot;balangay&quot; outrigger boats used in the original migrations of the first Austronesian peoples across the archipelago and beyond. The Polynesian Voyaging Society has two double-hull sailing catamarans, &quot;Hokulea&quot; and &quot;Hawaiiloa&quot;, and sails them between various islands in the Pacific using traditional Polynesian navigation methods without instruments. The &quot;Hikianalia&quot; and &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; are other extant double-hulled voyaging canoes.

==Terminology and linguistics==
The German linguist Otto Dempwolff (1871-1938) originally reconstructed the Proto-Austronesian word for &quot;boat&quot; as *waŋkaŋ, and included the reflexes for both *baŋkaʔ and *waŋkaʔ as its descendants. However modern linguists like Robert Blust generally reject this. Mahdi (2016) instead reconstructs four words for &quot;boat&quot; in the Austronesian languages, all ultimately derived from the monosyllabic protoforms *Cu and *baŋ. They are:
:a) *qaCu - cognates include Squliq-Atayal &quot;qasuʔ&quot;, Pazeh &quot;ʔasuʔ&quot;, and Bunun &quot;hatoʔ&quot;
:b) *qabaŋ - cognates include Kanakanavu &quot;abaŋɯ&quot;, Oponohu-Rukai &quot;havaŋu&quot;, Siraya &quot;avang&quot;, Gaddang &quot;ʔabaŋ&quot;, Tiruray &quot;ʔawaŋ&quot;, Iranun &quot;awaŋ&quot;, Mentawai &quot;abak&quot;, and Moken &quot;kabaŋ&quot;
:c) *baŋkaʔ - cognates include Kavalan &quot;baŋka&quot;, Tagalog &quot;baŋkaʔ&quot;, Tausug &quot;baŋkaʔ&quot;, Mori and Muna &quot;baŋka&quot;, and Sumbawa &quot;baŋka&quot;
:d) *waŋkaʔ&#x27; - cognates include Manggarai and Rembong &quot;waŋka&quot;, Tobati &quot;wăgě&quot;, Yabem &quot;waŋ&quot;, Suau &quot;waga&quot;, Hiw &quot;wakə&quot;, Mota &quot;aka&quot;, Fijian &quot;waqa&quot;, Tongan &quot;vaka&quot;, Māori &quot;waka&quot; and Hawaiian &quot;waa&quot;; Tahitian and Samoan &quot;vaa&quot;

Instead of being cognates, the protoforms *baŋkaʔ and *waŋkaʔ are believed to be doublets. The protoforms *qabaŋ and *baŋkaʔ are composites with a common precursor, with the &quot;*qa-&quot; and &quot;-*ka&quot; positioned differently. Only *qaCu and *qabaŋ can be traced back to Proto-Austronesian, with the rest being later developments.

The outrigger float is called the &quot;ama&quot; in many Polynesian languages (compare Hawaiian &quot;ama&quot;, Māori &quot;ama&quot;, and Samoan &quot;ama&quot;, all meaning &#x27;outrigger float&#x27;), realisations of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *saRman &#x27;outrigger float&#x27;. Similar terms also exist in other Malayo-Polynesian languages, such as Pohnpeian &quot;dahm&quot;, Yapese &quot;thaam&quot;, Ambonese Malay &quot;semang&quot;, all meaning &#x27;outrigger float&#x27;, as well as Chamorro &quot;sakman&quot; meaning &#x27;[a] large canoe.&#x27; The outrigger boom—spars connecting the &quot;ama&quot; to the main hull (or the two hulls in a double-hull canoe)—are called &quot;iako&quot; in Hawaiian and &quot;kiato&quot; in Māori (with similar words in other Polynesian languages), ultimately from Proto-Oceanic *kiajo or its doublet *kayajo both meaning &#x27;outrigger boom&#x27; (compare Loniu &quot;kiec&quot;, Kiribati &quot;kiaro&quot;, and Tongan &quot;kiato&quot;, as well as Seimat &quot;ayas&quot; and Gedaged &quot;ayad&quot;, all meaning &#x27;outrigger boom&#x27;). In Philippine languages, the outrigger floats are called &quot;katig&quot; or &quot;kate&quot;, from Proto-Philippine *katiR.

==Types==

Double-outrigger boats are more prevalent in Southeast Asia, though single-outriggers and catamarans also exist. They have two outrigger floats connected to spars lashed across a single hull. They range in size from small vessels like the &quot;jukung&quot;, &quot;vinta&quot;, and the &quot;paraw&quot;; to medium-sized trading and fishing vessels like the &quot;balangay&quot; and &quot;basnigan&quot;; to very large warships like the &quot;karakoa&quot; and &quot;kora kora&quot;. In Philippine vessels, additional booms called &quot;batangan&quot; are usually added across the outrigger spars (&quot;tadik&quot;), in between the outrigger floats (&quot;katig&quot;) and the main hull (&quot;bangka&quot;). In modern terminology, especially in leisure or sport boating, double-outrigger ships are usually termed trimaran or triple-hull ships.

An unusual type of double-outrigger boat design, preserved in scale models in the Pitt Rivers Museum, forms a triangle shape. The front ends of the outriggers are attached directly to the hull, while the rear ends are splayed out. These boats were small and used exclusively as passenger ferries in the Pasig River of the Philippines.

Catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are the traditional configurations in Polynesia, Micronesia, and Madagascar. In the Pacific Islands, a single outrigger float is called an &quot;ama&quot;. It is connected to the main hull by spars called &quot;iako&quot; (Hawaiian), &quot;iato&quot; (Tahitian), or &quot;kiato&quot; (Māori). The ama, which is usually rigged on the left side, provides stability. The paddlers need to be careful to avoid leaning too far on the opposite side of the ama, as that may cause the canoe to capsize (&quot;huli&quot; or &quot;lumai&quot;). Double-outrigger configurations, a later innovation from Southeast Asian Austronesians, never reached Oceania.

Single-outrigger dugout canoes also survived until recent times in some parts of the Philippines. Examples include a specimen in the University of Southampton from Manila Bay collected in the 1940s, as well as boats from Lake Bulusan and Lake Buhi of the Bicol Region of southern Luzon from as recently as 2015. The single outrigger is used to provide lateral stability, while still allowing fishermen to work with fishing nets. These boats were paddled and were not equipped with sails. They have largely disappeared in modern times, partly due to the scarcity of suitable timber and partly due to the relative cheapness of fiberglass boats.

==Modern sport==

Outrigger canoe racing has become a popular canoeing sport, with numerous clubs located around the world. Outrigger Canoe Racing is the State sport of Hawaii and an interscholastic high school sport. In Hawaii, entire families participate in summer regattas with age groups from keiki (children as young as 6 with an adult steersperson) and age 12 through age 60+.

Major races in Hawaii include the Molokai Hoe men&#x27;s race from the island of Molokai to Oahu across the Kaiwi Channel, Na Wahine O Ke Kai (same race for women) and the Queen Liliuokalani Race held near Kona on the Island of Hawai.
In modern sport outrigger canoeing, ships are classified according to the configuration and number of the hulls and the number of paddlers, including the OC1, OC2, OC3, OC4 and OC6 (with the respective number of paddlers using a single-hull outrigger canoe), and the DC12 or OC12 (with twelve paddlers using a double-hull outrigger canoe, two six-person canoes rigged together like a catamaran). Outriggers without a rudder are referred to as V1, V2, etc. (where V refers to &quot;vaa&quot;).

Six-person outrigger canoes (or OC6) are among the most commonly used for sport use; single-person outrigger canoes (or OC1) are also very common. Two and four-person outrigger canoes are also sometimes used, and two six-person outrigger canoes are sometimes rigged together like a catamaran to form a twelve-person double canoe.
Modern OC6 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic. However, some canoes are made of more traditional materials. In Ancient Hawaii, canoes were carved from the trunks of very old koa trees. These canoes, although rare, are still very much in use today. The iako are usually made of wood; the iako-ama and iako-hull connections are typically done with rope wrapped and tied in an interlocking fashion to reduce the risk of the connection coming completely apart if the rope breaks.

Modern OC1 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and/or Kevlar to produce a strong but light canoe. OC1 are often made with rudders operated by foot pedals. More traditional designs do not have rudders. OC1 commonly use iako made of aluminium or carbon fiber, with a mechanism for quickly assembling and disassembling the canoe (snap buttons, large wing nuts, etc.).

===Roles===
In an outrigger canoe, the paddlers sit in line, facing toward the bow of the canoe (i.e., forward, in the direction of travel, unlike rowing). The seats are numbered from 1 (closest to the bow) to the number of seats in the canoe, usually 6. The &quot;steerer&quot; (or &quot;steersman&quot; or &quot;steersperson&quot;) sits in the last seat of the canoe (seat 6 in the common OC6) and, as the name indicates, is primarily responsible for steering. The paddler sitting in seat 1 is called the &quot;stroke&quot; (or &quot;stroker&quot;) and is responsible for setting the pace of the paddle strokes. The stroker should have a high level of endurance to keep the rate (the number of strokes taken in a given amount of time) manageable for whatever the situation may be. The first two positions may also be involved in certain steering manoeuvers. This usually involves the draw stroke. During a tight turn, the one seat might poke to make the canoe turn the opposite way. In the middle of the canoe &quot;(seats number 3 and 4)&quot; known as the powerhouse are the strong and powerful paddlers. Any of the 2 can be the &#x27;caller&#x27; who directs when to switch over their blades, when to pick up or slow down the stroking pace, etc. Whoever is caller must have very good leadership skills and know how to think off the top of their heads in any situation. Every position has an important role to play in the canoe.

In an OC1, the single paddler must also steer the canoe. Some OC1s have rudders operated by foot pedals, while OC1s without rudders must be steered by drawing and paddling as needed for steering purposes while paddling to move the canoe forward.

====Steersman====

A good steersman is able to maintain the straight attitude of the canoe throughout the course of a race, and also keep the boat and the crew safe in rough sea conditions. They may also take advantage of water conditions to gain extra speed by surfing. The steersman uses a single bladed steering paddle which has a larger blade than a standard outrigger paddle, is built stronger, and has less or no bend in its shaft. They steer by the following methods:
* Poking: holding the paddle vertically against the side of the canoe, causing drag on that side to cause the canoe to turn that direction. (left to go left and right to go right)
* Drawing: paddling at a 45 to 90-degree angle to pull water under the canoe, causing the canoe to turn the opposite direction.
* Posting: holding the paddle in the water out to the side with the forward edge angled opposite to the desired turn direction, usually as a prelude to drawing.
* Paddling: by applying power on one side of the canoe, the steersman can influence to a small degree which way the canoe will turn. Paddling also increases the total power moving the canoe forward compared to the other steering methods. The steersman should try and paddle as much as possible so he or she doesn&#x27;t slow down the canoe by contributing to the amount of weight in the canoe.

A steersman also skippers the canoe and instructs all other paddlers as necessary. As an outrigger canoe is a long narrow canoe with the steersman placed at the very end, the steersman must give instructions sufficiently loudly and clearly for the entire crew to hear. From a water safety perspective the steersman should also be among the most experienced crew members, and be knowledgeable with the waterways and weather conditions, relevant maritime rules and other safety considerations such as the use of personal flotation devices, rigging of the canoe, placement of paddlers in the various seating positions, and recovery from a huli by righting the canoe and bailing out the water. The steersman should also be able to keep the ama down during rough water.

====Paddlers====

Paddlers use single-bladed paddles, usually with single or double bent shafts. The paddling stroke is similar to that of most other racing canoe paddling strokes, involving primarily core and lat strength. Generally, each paddler paddles on the opposite side from the paddler in directly front (for example, in an OC6, paddlers in seats 1, 3, and 5 paddle on one side, while paddlers in seats 2 and 4 paddle on the other side). All paddlers switch sides simultaneously on a call from one who is the designated caller. The steerer may paddle either side or switch sides as needed for steering purposes. The steersman will also switch sides to keep the ama from popping up and capsizing the canoe.

Stronger paddlers are typically placed in the middle of the canoe, while paddlers with the most endurance tend to be placed at the front, as the lead paddler sets the pace for the crew. All other paddlers synchronize their strokes to the paddler in front of them (whom they can directly see).

In rough water, it is often desirable to have a paddler with steering skill in seat 5 (of an OC6), to allow for the steerer to have that paddler also take steering strokes if needed in some situations. In conditions when the boat is surfing, the stern of the canoe will be so far out of the water that seat 5 will have to keep the boat on course. A seat 5 paddler with steering skill can also assist in preventing a huli by staying on the ama side during a particularly rough stretch of water.

In water rough enough to splash into the canoe, paddlers also need to pay attention to the water level in the canoe, report the situation to the steerer, and bail out the water as necessary. Paddlers also need to know how to recover from a huli under the steerer&#x27;s direction.

In a quick turn situation, paddlers at the front may also be instructed to &quot;une&quot; (poke steer, causes the canoe to turn the opposite direction) or &quot;kahi&quot; (post and draw steer, pulls the canoe to the side where this is done) to help bring the canoe around a turn quickly.

===Racing===

The length of a race ranges from short sprints (e.g., 250–500 metres for the OC1 and the OC12, 500–2000 metres (usually includes turns) for the OC6) to longer events, including marathons (e.g., 42 kilometres). A number of races are raced over distances that far exceed 42 kilometres, including the Molokai Hoe that crosses the Kaiwi Channel between the islands of Molokai and Oahu in Hawaii. However, long-distance races of 20 to 30 kilometres are more common, with shorter 5 to 8 kilometre courses typically being offered to novice paddlers and those under 20 years of age.

Longer races involving the OC6 often involve paddler replacements, which involve exit and entry to the canoe directly from the water while the canoe is underway (this is called a &quot;water change&quot;). Typically, nine paddlers form a crew, with six paddling the OC6 and the other three resting, drinking, and/or eating on an escort boat. Replacement typically occurs at 20 to 30 minute intervals; the escort boat drops the relief paddlers into the water ahead of the OC6, which is steered toward them. The relief paddlers climb in on the ama side as those they are replacing roll out into the water on the opposite side. The escort boat then picks up the paddlers in the water so that they can rest, drink, and/or eat before they, in turn, relieve some of the paddlers in the OC6.

The longer races are typically conducted in the open ocean, e.g., between islands in the South Pacific. The Molokai Hoe in Hawaii, The Hamilton Cup in Australia, The Vaka Eiva in Rarotonga (Cook Islands), The Motu2Motu in Aitutaki (Cook Islands) and the Catalina Channel crossing in California are four examples of races involving water changes.

Paddlers and crews are usually classified by gender and age. Gender classification is typically straightforward, with male, female, and coed classifications, with the latter being a crew with equal numbers of male and female paddlers (different rules may apply to nine-person coed crews doing a race with paddler replacements). Age classifications typically include youth divisions like 19-and-under, 16-and-under, etc., master divisions with minimum ages typically starting at 35 or 40 years of age, and an open division which allows paddlers of any age. A novice division for paddlers with less than a specified number of years of race experience (usually one or two) may also exist in a given association.

In some races, a particular type of outrigger canoe, usually a more traditional design for the region, may be given its own racing classification. For example, races in Hawaii have a koa division, while southern California has a Bradley OC6 division and northern California OC1 sprint races have a traditional (no rudder) division.

==== Organisations ====
The International Va&#x27;a Federation (IVF) oversees va&#x27;a racing worldwide, including the IVF World Championships and at the Pacific Games.

Outrigger racing organizations in the United States include the East Coast Outrigger Racing Association (ECORA), the Hawaiian Canoe Racing Association (HCRA), the Northern California Outrigger Canoe Association (NCOCA), the Southern California Outrigger Canoe Association (SCORA), and several more.

<doc id="1100238" wikidata="Q2313011" url="?curid=1100238" title="Glen Buxton">
<text>Glen Edward Buxton (November 10, 1947 – October 19, 1997) was an American guitarist who played lead guitar for the rock band Alice Cooper. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 90 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. In 2011, Buxton was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the original Alice Cooper band.

== Early life ==
Born in Akron, Ohio, Buxton moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and attended Cortez High School. Cortez High School had a paper called the Tip Sheet which detailed events going on at the school. Alongside Dennis Dunaway and Vince Furnier, Glen Buxton contributed to the school paper. His contribution was as photographer. Dunaway was sports writer for the paper and Furnier was writer of a witty editorial column. In 1964, at Cortez High School, he made his debut in a rock band called The Earwigs. It was composed of fellow high school students Dennis Dunaway, Vincent Furnier, John Tatum and John Speer. At the onset, Buxton was the only member who could play an instrument, and thus taught some of the other members to play after the group decided to take a shot at becoming a real band. They became popular locally, and changed their name to The Spiders in 1965 and later to The Nazz in 1967. In 1966–67, guitarist John Tatum and drummer John Speer left the group, and rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Bruce and drummer Neal Smith joined. In 1968, to avoid legal entanglements with the Todd Rundgren-led Nazz the group changed their name to Alice Cooper, premiering their new name at their performance at the Santa Barbara County Fairgrounds on March 20, 1968.

== Alice Cooper ==
Buxton was the co-writer of hit songs like &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot;, &quot;Elected,&quot; and &quot;10 Minutes Before the Worm&quot;. He is credited as lead guitarist on seven albums by Alice Cooper, including the chart-topping &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;. However, he was &quot;not invited&quot; to play on 1973&#x27;s &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; and does not appear, although he is credited due to management&#x27;s concerns about band image with the fans. Buxton had co-written four songs for &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; but does not play on any of them. According to drummer Neal Smith, the absence was due to &quot;problems that Glen was having with the demons of rock and roll at that particular time...&quot; The band sought out other guitar players to fill in, including Dick Wagner and fellow Cortez High School alum Mick Mashbir.

In an interview with Marc Maron, according to Alice Cooper, &quot;Glen ended up being one of the great rock guitar players of all time. He created &#x27;School&#x27;s Out&#x27;. He created all that stuff.&quot; In a separate interview, Cooper stated, &quot;Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, &#x27;What is that line? It&#x27;s so weird, but it&#x27;s catchy.&#x27; Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake.&quot;

== Post Alice Cooper years ==
Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Buxton maintained a low profile, playing only occasional club gigs with bands like Shrapnel and Virgin.
In the 1990s, Buxton lived in Clarion, Iowa, performing with local artists. In 1994 Buxton founded the band Buxton-Flynn with his long time friend, Michael Flynn. The band played shows throughout southern Minnesota and north Iowa.

== Death ==
Buxton died of complications from pneumonia at a hospital in Mason City, Iowa, on October 19, 1997, aged 49. He had recently spent time visiting and playing music with two of his Alice Cooper bandmates and longtime friends, Michael Bruce and Neal Smith. With bassist Richie Scarlet (Frehley&#x27;s Comet) filling in for Buxton&#x27;s longtime friend and Alice Cooper bandmate Dennis Dunaway (who was unable to attend due to illness), and John Glenn on keyboards, Buxton, Smith, and Bruce performed on a morning radio show in Houston on October 10, 1997, and performed a concert at nightclub Area 51 in Houston on October 12, 1997. Buxton mentioned having some pain at the nightclub and his friends urged him to see a doctor, but Buxton replied he would wait until he got home. On October 19, his fiancée drove him to the hospital near his home in Clarion, Iowa, where he died of viral pneumonia. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Clarion, Iowa.

<doc id="1100245" wikidata="Q4860041" url="?curid=1100245" title="Bard Graduate Center">
<text>The Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture is a graduate research institute and gallery located in New York City. It is affiliated with Bard College, located in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. The gallery occupies a six-story townhouse at 18 West 86th Street while the academic building and library are located at 38 West 86th Street.

Students at Bard Graduate Center focus on the study of the cultural history of the material world.

==Programs==
Bard Graduate Center offers two programs of study, one leading to a Masters of Arts degree and the other to a Doctor of Philosophy degree. Students in these programs can select courses dealing with various aspects of the cultural history of the material world. Bard Graduate Center also has a Gallery presenting regular exhibitions relating to the history of the decorative arts, design and material culture, as well as Focus Project exhibitions, small-scale academically rigorous exhibitions and publications that are developed and executed by Bard Graduate Center faculty and postdoctoral fellows in collaboration with students in the MA and PhD programs.

Students in the MA and PhD programs take the same courses. The curriculum for the master&#x27;s degree includes a number of required courses, tutorials, independent studies, travel, and internships.

Students otherwise construct their own program of study. The BGC is known for its focus on New York and American Material Culture; History and Theory of Museums; Modern Design History; Early Modern Europe; and Comparative Medieval Material Culture (China, Islam, Europe).

==Teaching==
In addition to formal classes, Bard Graduate Center runs a series of evening colloquia designed to function in a kind of polyphony with the &quot;for credit&quot; course offerings. Regular evening seminars, which are open to the academic public, serve as foci. In addition, the History and Theory of Museums program brings in speakers affiliated with current exhibitions, and the Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Europe group cosponsors two annual events with the Columbia University interdepartmental group on Medieval and Renaissance studies.

The endowed lecture series bring in a regular sequence of speakers on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century France and on the history of glass. Every May the BGC participates, as the founding organizer, in the Consortium for American Material Culture, along with Yale University, Boston University, the University of Delaware, the University of Wisconsin—Madison, the Smithsonian Institution, and our local partners at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New-York Historical Society.

The hands-on examination of objects is an essential feature of study at Bard Graduate Center. Incorporated into the first-year Survey of the Decorative Arts, Design History, and Material Culture course are &quot;Materials Days,&quot; events that focus on the making of things, so that students can experience materiality from the maker&#x27;s perspective.

== Exhibitions ==
Bard Graduate Center Gallery present exhibitions and a broad range of exhibition-related programs including exhibition lectures, curatorial conversations, gallery talks, films, and exhibition catalogues devoted to enhancing knowledge and awareness of the material world.

==Notable alumni==
 graduates of the Bard Graduate Centre include:

* Grace Jeffers, design educator - Master&#x27;s degree in history of decorative arts (1996)
*Sarah Archer, curator and writer - Master&#x27;s degree in Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture (2006)
*Daniella Ohad Smith, design historian and writer - PhD

<text>James Carson Whitsett (May 1, 1945 – May 8, 2007) was an American keyboardist, songwriter, and record producer.

==Biography==
Carson Whitsett was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He joined his older brother Tim&#x27;s band, Tim Whitsett &amp; The Imperials (later known as The Imperial Show Band) and quickly became a stand-out on the B-3 organ. Following the breakup of the band, Whitsett spent time in Canada playing with Eric Mercury before an invitation to Stax Records where Tim Whitsett was now in charge of the label&#x27;s East Memphis publishing arm. Carson&#x27;s playing inspired bassist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn and drummer Al Jackson Jr. to re-emerge, along with Stax session guitarist Bobby Manuel in place of Steve Cropper, as The MG&#x27;s, releasing an album in 1973.

Whitsett moved to Malaco Records, where he played in the Malaco Rhythm Section with drummer James Stroud, bassist Vernie Robbins and guitarist Jerry Puckett, appearing on Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot; album, Anita Ward&#x27;s &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, Dorothy Moore&#x27;s &quot;Misty Blue&quot;, albums by Connie Francis and fellow Mississippian Paul Davis, one of the highest selling blues albums in Z. Z. Hill&#x27;s &quot;Down Home Blues&quot;, and numerous albums by others such as Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Little Milton, and Johnnie Taylor. Several Malaco acts, including Taylor and Moore, recorded songs written by Whitsett, and he produced Fern Kinney&#x27;s No. 1 UK hit, &quot;Together We Are Beautiful&quot; in 1980.

Whitsett&#x27;s first major success as a songwriter also came in 1980 with a number one song on the Adult Contemporary chart (#18 Pop, #30 Country), J. Fred Knobloch&#x27;s &quot;Why Not Me&quot;. Lorrie Morgan requested on her debut album to record Whitsett&#x27;s &quot;Dear Me&quot;, which became her first top ten hit. Another country hit followed with John Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Mississippi Moon&quot;, co-written with Tony Joe White. With longtime collaborator and friend Dan Penn and Hoy Lindsey, Whitsett penned the title track to Solomon Burke&#x27;s Grammy winning album &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot;, later covered by Joe Cocker and Susan Boyle. Actor Peter Gallagher performed the song on the hit television show, &quot;The O.C.&quot;

Other artists who recorded songs written or co-written by Carson Whitsett include Etta James, Eddie Floyd, Johnny Adams, James Carr, Ruth Brown, and Wilson Pickett, as well as country musicians Conway Twitty and Barbara Mandrell, plus gospel singers Albertina Walker and The Staple Singers. He also played and wrote material for B. B. King, Jerry Butler, Suzy Bogguss, and Irma Thomas, among others. At least two Carson Whitsett collaborations are considered modern day blues standards in Joe Louis Walker&#x27;s &quot;Blues of the Month Club&quot; and the W.C. Handy Award winning &quot;One Foot in the Blues&quot; recorded by Johnny Adams.

In 2002, Whitsett served as arranger for Patti Page, on her &quot;Sweet Sounds of Christmas&quot; CD, and in 2006, played on Janis Ian&#x27;s &quot;Folk Is the New Black&quot;. He teamed again with Dan Penn and Hoy Lindsey, writing a dozen songs, arranging, and playing on the &quot;Better to Have It&quot; album by Bobby Purify in 2005. He played on several Tony Joe White albums including &quot;The Heroines&quot; in 2004 with singers Lucinda Williams, Shelby Lynne, Jessi Colter, and Emmylou Harris and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Uncovered&quot;, which featured guest appearances by Eric Clapton, J. J. Cale, Michael McDonald, Mark Knopfler, and also Waylon Jennings in one of his last performances.

For several years he served as keyboardist for Kathy Mattea and became friends with Mattea&#x27;s husband, songwriter Jon Vezner. During this time, Whitsett also recorded three solo piano projects. In November 2005, he was interviewed along with Spooner Oldham in &quot;Keyboard Player Magazine&quot;.

Carson Whitsett died in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 8, 2007, of brain cancer. Dan Penn said of his collaborator of the past three decades that &quot;he played with the most authentic R&amp;B feel of anybody I ever worked with&quot;.

<text>The British Rail Class 127 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby in 1959. Thirty 4-car units were built, formed of two outer driving motor vehicles, sandwiching two intermediate trailers which were classified class 186. The technical description of such as 4-car unit was DMBS + TSL + TS + DMBS.

==Numbering==

==Usage==
The units were almost exclusively used on London St. Pancras to Bedford commuter services, which earned the class the nickname &quot;Bed-Pan&quot; units. The class was maintained at a new purpose-built depot at Cricklewood.

==Powertrain==
Unlike other &quot;Heritage&quot; DMU units, the class 127 units had hydraulic transmission (as opposed to the more standard mechanical transmission). 
The gear selector in the driver&#x27;s cab had a &quot;D&quot; position where &quot;4&quot; would be on other standard transmission units.
As built, these units were coded Blue Square, and were therefore able to work with mechanical transmission units, provided the driver remembered to use 1,2,3,D instead of just selecting D.
This was changed to a unique code of Red Triangle when a driver forgot he had a mechanical transmission unit on the rear of his train, which meant this unit was driven only in fourth gear, which burnt out the transmissions on that unit.
Power was provided by C8NFLH engines supplied by Rolls-Royce. For further information on the powertrain see British Rail British United Traction.

==Replacement==

The class 127 units operated one of the most intensive passenger services worked by diesel multiple units and, by the late 1970s, it was clear they needed replacing. It was therefore decided to electrify the Bedford line and replace the Class 127 units with new Class 317 electric multiple units. The class 127 units should have been withdrawn by 1982, however, delays with the new trains meant they had to struggle on in service until July 1983. This was largely due to an industrial dispute with the unions over Driver only operation, which resulted in the new electric trains being stored at Cricklewood depot for nearly a year, awaiting the resolution of the dispute.

From early 1983, they had commenced operations on the Gospel Oak to Barking line at first running in three-car then finally two-car formations from November 1983 with just the two power cars. The units lasted in service on this line until eventually being withdrawn in March 1984. The units were then stored at Carlisle depot pending reuse, preservation or scrapping. Subsequently, many trailer vehicles saw further use in combination with Class 116 units, based at Tyseley depot in Birmingham. These lasted until October 1993.

==Rebuilding==
In 1985, 22 redundant power cars, including the first built, no. 51591, were rebuilt to form 11 two-car parcels units. Vehicles were renumbered 55966-987, and formed into sets CH910 to CH920. Units were fitted with roller shutter doors, and were based at Chester depot. The units lasted in service until 1989, when they were withdrawn.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 10 October 1964, on an eight-car London St Pancras to Bedford service, a cardan shaft failed on rear car 51591 near Wilshamstead. The failed shaft pierced two fuel tanks, which then caught fire. One person was killed and four injured by jumping from the train. The fire caused only minor damage and was brought under control by the train crew and a railwayman passenger.

==Preservation==
Three units have been preserved on heritage railways, although only one of these contains a trailer vehicle.

<text>Aladár Gerevich (16 March 1910 – 14 May 1991) was a Hungarian fencer, regarded as &quot;the greatest Olympic swordsman ever&quot;. He won seven gold medals in sabre at six different Olympic Games.

== Biography ==
Gerevich was the first athlete to win the same Olympic event six times (despite two Games cancelled because of the Second World War) with a record 28-year gap between first and last medals. (Both records were broken by Isabell Werth, who won seven team dressage golds between 1992 and 2024.)

Gerevich&#x27;s wife, Erna Bogen (also known as Erna Bogathy), his son, Pál Gerevich, and his father-in-law, Albert Bogen (a silver medalist in team sabre for Austria at the 1912 Summer Olympics), all won Olympic medals in fencing.

In the Hungarian Olympic trials for the 1960 Rome Olympics, the fencing committee told Gerevich that he was too old to compete. He silenced them by challenging the entire sabre team to individual matches and winning every match. He missed the finals of the 1960 Olympic individual sabre event, and a possible individual gold medal, by a single touch. After retiring, he coached fencing at the Vasas Sports Club in Budapest, where he died aged 81. Asteroid 228893 Gerevich, discovered by Krisztián Sárneczky and Brigitta Sipőcz at Piszkéstető Station in 2003, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 16 January 2014 ().

<text>The Bell X-22 is an American V/STOL X-plane with four tilting ducted fans. Takeoff was to selectively occur either with the propellers tilted vertically upwards, or on a short runway with the nacelles tilted forward at approximately 45°. Additionally, the X-22 was to provide more insight into the tactical application of vertical takeoff troop transporters such as the preceding Hiller X-18 and the X-22&#x27;s successor, the Bell XV-15. Another program requirement was a true airspeed in level flight of at least 525 km/h (326 mph; 283 knots).

The X-22 was not a prototype of the V-22 Osprey, although it was a part of the development of tilt-rotor aircraft and Bell&#x27;s work in this field of study.

==Design and development==
In 1962, the United States Navy announced their request for two prototype aircraft with V/STOL capability, powered by four ducted fan nacelles. Bell Helicopters already had extensive experience with VTOL aircraft and was able to utilize an already developed test mockup. In 1964 the prototype, internally referred to by Bell as Model D2127, was ordered by the Navy and received the X-22 designation. It was unveiled at an event in Niagara Falls in May 1965.

Three-bladed propellers were mounted on four wings and synchronized through a wave-interconnection system, were connected to four gas turbines which, in turn, were mounted in pairs on the rear wings. Maneuvering was achieved by tilting the propeller blades in combination with control surfaces (elevators and ailerons), which were located in the thrust stream of the propellers.

==Operational history==
The maiden flight of the prototype occurred on 17 March 1966. In contrast to other tilt-rotor craft (such as the Bell XV-3), transitions between hovering and horizontal flight succeeded nearly immediately. However, interest increased more towards VTOL and V/STOL properties, not the specific design of the prototype.

Due to failure of a propeller control, described by test pilot Stanley Kakol as the only non-redundant component in the power chain, the prototype crashed on 8 August 1966 and technicians stripped it for components in order to make the second prototype flight capable. The fuselage was still used as a simulator for some time afterwards.

The second X-22 first flew on 26 August 1967. Early that year, it was equipped with a variable flight control and stabilizer system from Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, which improved flight performance. Although the X-22 was considered to be the best aircraft of its type at the time, the program was canceled. The required maximum speed of 525 km/h was never reached. The second prototype was moved to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory for further testing; the last flight occurred in 1988.

==Surviving aircraft==
Although not on display, the remaining craft, 151521, is currently stored by the Niagara Aerospace Museum, New York.

According to the employees at the Museum, the craft was held onto after being debated for scrapping by the Navy.

<text>Jacob Gaón (born in Vitoria, Spain, died in Tolosa, Spain, 1463) was a Jewish Basque tax collector.

The Gaóns were a Jewish family in Vitoria, Álava, today in the autonomous community of the Basque Country, Spain. In the 15th century, several of them collected taxes for the kings of Castile.

In 1463, Jacob Gaón went to the province of Gipuzkoa and reclaimed a tax called &quot;pedido&quot; to the inhabitants of the villa of Tolosa. They refused, arguing they had an exemption from paying these tributes, according to &quot;fueros&quot; and laws passed by the previous kings. Gaón menaced them, and several Tolosans killed him, cut his head off and hung it up on the top of a pillory, as a punishment for having put Tolosa up on the top of his tax collection list. When King Henry IV of Castile knew his collector had been killed, he headed to Tolosa, in order to avenge his death. The king ordered the demolition of the house in which the crime had taken place, but the killers had escaped out of town. The Guipúzcoan local authorities applied to the king, explaining the Tolosans&#x27; reasons and begging pardon for them. Eventually, Henry acknowledged that the Tolosans were exempted from this contribution and pardoned them.

<text>The Pazzi Chapel () is a chapel located in the &quot;first cloister&quot; on the southern flank of the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Italy. Commonly credited to Filippo Brunelleschi, it is considered to be one of the masterpieces of Renaissance architecture.

== History ==
Though funds for the chapel were assembled in 1429 by Andrea Pazzi, head of the Pazzi family, whose wealth was second only to the Medici, construction did not begin until about 1442. The chapel was completed in 1478. The building is considered to be an Early Renaissance masterpiece.

Formerly considered a work of Filippo Brunelleschi (d. 1446), it is now thought that he was responsible for the plan, which is based on simple geometrical forms, the square and the circle, but not for the building&#x27;s execution and detailing. The most common argument for crediting Brunelleschi is the chapel&#x27;s clear similarity to the Old Sacristy; others argue that his style had developed in the twenty-year interim and that the Pazzi Chapel would represent a retrograde step. The first written mention of Brunelleschi as the architect was written by an anonymous author in the 1490s. Scholars now consider the chapel as possibly the work of Giuliano da Maiano or Michelozzo. A façade thought to have been begun by Brunelleschi, of which only the lower register can be seen, was partially obscured by the addition of a porch. The main inspiration for this piece was the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria Novella, also located in Florence.

The main purpose of the building was the cathedral chapter house (meeting room for the governing chapter) and use as a classroom for the teaching of monks and other religious purposes. There was also a chapel behind the altar where the commissioning family had the right to bury its dead. The Pazzi&#x27;s ulterior motive in building the chapel was probably to make their mark on the city of Florence and to emphasize their wealth and power. The fact that the city was at war with a neighboring city at the time and still acquired the funds to build this chapel showed the importance it had to the Pazzi family and the people of Florence.

The size of the chapel was predetermined by existing walls, creating an unusual situation, however, where the space was not square as in the Old Sacristy, which was the model for this building, but rectangular and transept-like and thus in contradistinction to the square, axially placed altar. Despite this, and its complex history, the building gives us insight into the ambitions of Renaissance architects in their struggle to bring coherence to the architectural language of columns, pilasters, arches and vaults. Between the pilasters in the transept there are tall, blank, round headed panels and, above them, roundels, common Renaissance decorative motifs. The architecture of the interior is articulated by the use of pietra serena, a dark, high quality, fine grained sandstone, though in fact the load-bearing structure of the building is its masonry, i.e. it is the walls that support the arches and domes, not the pilasters which are decorative rather than structural. 

The tondi of the seated Apostles are by Luca della Robbia, who also did the terracotta decorations in the cupola of the porch. The glazed terracotta roundels of the Four Evangelists inside the chapel derive from similar tondos by Donatello in the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo, Florence, with the attribute of each Evangelist holding open a book that the saint appears to be copying, an unusual iconography.

<text>Billie Ray Martin is a German singer and songwriter, known for her single &quot;Your Loving Arms&quot;, which reached the top 10 of both the UK singles chart (#6) and the Irish Singles Chart (#8) in 1995, and reached number one on the US Dance Club Chart. She was also one of the vocalists on the S&#x27;Express UK top 10 hit single &quot;Hey Music Lover&quot; (1989), and had UK top 40 hits as lead vocalist of Electribe 101 with &quot;Tell Me When the Fever Ended&quot; (1989) and &quot;Talking with Myself&quot; (1990), and as a solo singer with &quot;Running Around Town&quot; (1995) and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1996).

== Early life ==
Born in Hamburg, West Germany, she grew up near Reeperbahn, St. Pauli, in the city&#x27;s red-light district. She lived with her working-class grandparents, who exposed her to Elvis Presley and German schlager music.

== Career ==
=== Career beginnings ===
In the early 1980s, Billie Ray Martin moved to Berlin. It was the time of electronic bands like Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle and the early Human League, shaping Martin&#x27;s conceptions of music. Simultaneously, she encountered the soul music of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Aretha Franklin and the Motown revival. In Berlin, she formed an eleven piece soul and sixties inspired band called Billie and the Deep. Their live shows became very popular in Berlin in 1985–86.

After these experiences, Billie Ray Martin moved to London, where she placed an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reading &quot;soul rebel seeks musical genius&quot;. The ad led to a meeting with four men from Birmingham who had been looking for a voice to add to their music, resulting in the formation of Electribe 101. The band returned to Birmingham, where they recorded their first song, entitled &quot;Talking with Myself&quot;, releasing it as a 12&quot; single on their own &quot;Hipnotic&quot; label. It was noticed by manager Tom Watkins (who managed Pet Shop Boys, Bros and East 17). Electribe 101 signed with Watkins, and his label Phonogram Records.

Meanwhile, Billie Ray Martin had met DJ Mark Moore who invited her to the studio to work with his band S&#x27;Express. Martin contributed to three songs on their debut album &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot;: &quot;Pimps, Pushers and Prostitutes&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Age du Gateau&quot; and &quot;Hey Music Lover&quot; (retitled &#x27;Music Lover&#x27; in the US). The latter became the third S&#x27;Express single, and a top 10 UK hit (reaching No. 6), giving Martin her first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance. She traveled across Europe with the group for a number of TV appearances in support of the single.

Electribe 101&#x27;s first single with Phonogram was &quot;Tell Me When the Fever Ended&quot; released in November 1989, reaching No. 32 on the UK charts, and No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance charts. &quot;Talking with Myself&quot; was re-released in February 1990 with a Frankie Knuckles mix and became a hit reaching No. 23 in the UK and No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance charts. DJ and producer Marshall Jefferson refused to remix it as he felt it was &quot;already perfect&quot;. &quot;Talking with Myself&quot; remains a club classic and has appeared on countless Ibiza and chill-out compilations over the past 22 years. &quot;Talking with Myself&quot; was re-mixed in 1998 and reached No. 39 in the UK charts.

Billie Ray Martin appeared on the cover of &quot;i-D Magazine&quot;, as well as weekly music/pop periodicals such as: &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;Number One&quot;. NME described her style as looking like &#x27;Cilla Black on Acid&#x27; when she made her first Top of the Pops appearance. A connection with Steve Nieve led to her being a guest vocalist with house band Steve Nieve and The Playboys, singing &quot;Stay With Me&quot; and &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;, on the Channel X UK television series &quot;The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross&quot;.

Electribe 101&#x27;s third single was entitled &quot;You’re Walking&quot; and reached No. 50 on the UK charts, prior to the release of their debut album &quot;Electribal Memories&quot;. A live concert at London&#x27;s The Town &amp; Country Club (now The London Forum) was televised on ITV to coincide with the album&#x27;s release. They also played at the Milton Keynes Bowl in support to Erasure. Electribe 101 were then selected as the supporting act for the European leg of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &#x27;World Violation&#x27; tour, including several nights at both the Birmingham NEC and Wembley Arena. A fourth single was released – a cover of the Jesse Rae song &quot;Inside Out&quot;, the video of which was filmed in Paris.

The band then set to work on their second album, with a provisional title of &quot;Electronic Soul&quot;. However, conflict with Watkins and Phonogram led to the album not being released. While seeking another label, the band broke up.

=== Solo: 1993–2002 ===

BRM&#x27;s debut solo release was at the end of 1993 in collaboration with the British dance duo Spooky on a cover of the Throbbing Gristle song &#x27;Persuasion&#x27;. Her second release was the &#x27;Four Ambient Tales&#x27; EP with Dave Ball and Richard Norris of The Grid. She made an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, performing a cover of Ann Peebles’ &quot;I’m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down&quot; with Slash from Guns N’Roses on guitar.

With a new set of songs, she signed with East West Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music. In the US, Martin was signed to Seymour Stein&#x27;s Sire Records. The first release with her new label was &quot;Your Loving Arms&quot; again with Dave Ball and Richard Norris of The Grid on production. The track reached No. 38 in November 1994. On a subsequent re-release the song peaked at No. 6 in the UK singles chart in May 1995, Martin once again appearing on Top of the Pops as well as various UK and European TV shows in support of the song. Further mixes by Todd Terry and Brothers in Rhythm helped the song reach No. 1. It also topped the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and eventually reached the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 20 of Radio &amp; Records magazine&#x27;s CHR/Pop airplay chart (ranking No. 76 on the 1996 year-end chart).

In February 1995, the Junior Vasquez mix of &quot;True Moments of My World&quot; was being played in clubs, but was not released as her next single. Instead, &quot;Running Around Town&quot; was chosen and reached No. 29 in the UK, as well as hitting No. 1 on the club charts. Her solo album entitled &quot;Deadline for My Memories&quot; was planned for an Autumn release, but was delayed until 1996. It included several songs originally destined for Electribe 101&#x27;s second album. The album was preceded by extensive press coverage including a number of magazine cover stories. Martin also guested on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;...Later with Jools Holland&quot; performing two songs from the album: &quot;Hands Up And Amen&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe&quot;. The album was preceded by a third single, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, which reached No. 29. A video for the single was filmed in the docks and bars of Hamburg and featured members of Billie&#x27;s family and friends. &quot;Deadline for My Memories&quot; was released at the end of January. Two further singles were released from the album: &quot;Space Oasis&quot;, and the ballad, &quot;You And I (Keep Holding On)&quot;. TV appearances continued, including a live MTV performance from Turkey.

Meanwhile, Martin continued to write songs for a projected second album, but left the Warner label and moved to New York, where she wrote with dance music producer, Fred Jorio. She signed with React Music Limited in the UK, and released the single, &quot;Honey&quot;. The song hit No. 1 in the club charts but poor performance on the UK singles chart caused the cancellation of a planned second release. &quot;Honey&quot; debuted stateside courtesy of Nervous Records four years later. The song peaked at No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. During this time, she also recorded an album of soul and blues songs with the Jon Tiven Group in New York, but this album remains unreleased. A single and an EP of her drum and bass recordings were released by NY label Finetune recordings. The single was &quot;Pacemaker&quot; while the EP was entitled &quot;Crime &amp; Punishment&quot;.

In 2000, Martin travelled to Memphis, Tennessee to record her next album at the House of Blues studio. Her band was led by Marvell Thomas, son of Rufus Thomas, and featured members of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s own band. Ann Peebles and Carla Thomas provided backing vocals, while Peebles did a duet with Martin on the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Eighteen Carat Garbage&quot;. The album &quot;18 Carat Garbage&quot; was released on Martin&#x27;s own Sonnenstahl Records label. Four 12&quot; singles on vinyl were initially released from the album: &quot;Systems of Silence&quot; was released on 2 January 2001 followed by &quot;18 Carat Garbage&quot; on 16 January 2001 and then &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been To Memphis&quot; in March 2001 and the Motown inspired &quot;Where Fools Rush In&quot; in September 2001. In 2002, Sonnenstahl Records released the 12-track CD &quot;Recycled Garbage&quot;, a compilation of remixes of selected tracks from &quot;18 Carat Garbage&quot;.

=== Solo: 2003–current ===

In 2003, Martin released a series of singles on her new Disco Activisto label, including the electronic music club hits &quot;No Brakes on My Rollerskates&quot; and &quot;Dead Again&quot;. In 2005–06 she released collaborations with DJ Hell and Slam. The song &quot;Je Regrette Everything&quot; (written by Billie and Mikael Delta) appeared on DJ Hell&#x27;s album &quot;NY Muscle&quot; (Universal Music). DJ Hell said of Martin &quot;she&#x27;s one of the living legends in modern music history and one of the best voices on planet earth&quot;. &quot;Bright Lights Fading&quot; appeared on Slam&#x27;s &quot;Year Zero&quot; album. Both this and &quot;Je Regrette Everything&quot; were subsequently released as singles. The Moroder-influenced solo single &quot;Undisco Me&quot; was released on Rebirth Records in April 2007, and reached No. 6 in the UK Dance Chart. Martin also began a second career as a disc jockey launching her own clubnight Komputerliebe in London and then Frankfurt.

In 2008, Martin formed a new band, The Opiates, with Robert Solheim producing. The Opiates made their live debut at Rough Trade, Brick Lane, London, in March, to coincide with the group&#x27;s first release, the &quot;Anatomy of a Plastic Girl&quot; EP. In 2010, she released &quot;The Crackdown Project&quot; featuring her takes on the Cabaret Voltaire classic album, &quot;The Crackdown&quot;. 2011 began with the solo single &quot;Sweet Suburban Disco&quot;. She corroborated with Hard Ton on the &quot;Sold Life&quot; EP, featuring a new song &quot;Sold Life&quot; and a cover of the Pierre&#x27;s Pfantasy Club classic, &quot;Fantasy Girl&quot;.

A second EP from The Opiates, titled &quot;Rainy Days and Remixes&quot;, was released in September 2011 as a prelude to their album &quot;Hollywood Under The Knife&quot;. A short UK tour including a performance at HMV on Oxford Street, London launched the album, which was packaged in imagery by Turner Prize winner Wolfgang Tillmans. The album got a four star review in Metro. In February 2012, a remix collection entitled &quot;Hollywood Cuts&quot; was released.

2012 saw the release of a series of collaborations including &quot;Make Me Feel&quot; on Terranova&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Amour&quot; album, and &quot;Hyper Lust&quot; on the new album from Motor. In September, Martin released a limited edition DVD entitled &quot;Five Takes (A Song About Andy)&quot;, featuring five movies inspired by Andy Warhol&#x27;s Screen Tests. The song &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot; is presented in five unique takes, with music by electronic producer and soul singer, Waterson.

On 3 February 2023, it was announced via Mary Wilson&#x27;s Facebook page that &quot;Soul Defender&quot;, written by Martin, would be released on 3 March 2023, which would have been Wilson&#x27;s 79th birthday.

<text>The &#x27;Neopets TCG&#x27; is an out-of-print collectible card game and a spin-off of the popular virtual pet browser game, Neopets. The game was launched in 2003 and produced by Wizards of the Coast, a large trading card company that produces a variety of other trading card games. Neopets is aimed at a slightly younger audience than other Wizards of the Coast offerings such as &quot;&quot;. As with many other trading card games, the cards serve two purposes, collecting and playing a game.

The card game was discontinued in 2006.

==Gameplay overview==

&quot;Neopets TCG&quot; is a two-player game, where each player has a play deck of at least 40 cards and a separate deck of at least 10 Basic Neopets. Most deck-building articles suggest a limit of 2-3 species for the Basic Neopets, along with a minimum of 20 Item and/or Equipment cards (essentially half of the deck). Each card may have only 3 copies included. Players start with a single Neopet on the first turn, moving up to three by the third turn. These Neopets compete against opposing Neopets in four different arenas: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Magic. Winning a competition during a player&#x27;s own turn allows the player to bank or draw a card; banking enough cards of sufficient value eventually leads to victory.

==Types of cards==
The various Neopets cards are divided into categories that affect gameplay in different ways. The different card types are as follows:

* Basic Neopet
* Experienced Neopet
* Item
* Equipment
* Hero
* Villain
* Something Has Happened!
* Location
* Fate (Curse and Quest)
* Constellation

===Basic Neopet (Yellow)===
The Basic Neopet cards are the foundation of the game, and are based on the creatures from the Neopets website. The cards list four abilities or attributes, which are: strength, agility, intelligence, and magic. Each of these is given a value, with a higher number denoting a greater power or skill in a given category. Basic Neopets never have a printed score higher than 10, or lower than 1.

===Experienced Neopet (Grey)===
The Experienced Neopet is much like an evolved Pokémon in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. An Experienced Neopet has higher attributes, and often has helpful special abilities that influence various part of the game. The Experienced Neopet cards consist of both a Neopet species and an occupation, e.g. Jubjub Engineer. Only Neopets of the matching base species can transform into the Experienced Neopet role, so, for example, only a Jubjub could turn into a Jubjub Engineer, while a Mynci could not.

===Hero &amp; Villain (White, and Black)===
Villain cards and Hero cards both have extremely high ability numbers, and are designed to oppose one another. If a villain is played, the arena in which the villain is located is effectively sealed off until the villain is confronted and beaten, until which point the players cannot start contests against their opponent in that arena, only the villain. A Hero card can be used to fight a difficult battle (often against a villain), but can be used only once before being discarded.

===Item &amp; Equipment (Red, and Blue)===
Item and Equipment cards increase a Neopet&#x27;s abilities, by adding points onto the printed base number in one or more categories, and frequently have special abilities that affect gameplay. Whereas Items can only be used once before being discarded, Equipment is attached to the Neopet and remains there until it is removed by another card. The advantage to Items is that they can be sprung upon an opponent unexpectedly.

Item and Equipment cards are also the only cards worth points, ranging from 0 to 8. A player must &quot;bank&quot; 21 points worth of Items and Equipment cards in order to win the game.

===Something Has Happened! (Purple)===
Something Has Happened! cards cause a one-time, instantaneous event or effect to occur. These cards often are used to influence the outcome of a battle, and are then discarded. Because one can discover that &quot;Something has Happened!&quot; at virtually any time, such cards can introduce a heavy element of surprise.

===Location (Green)===
Location cards can be played in one area to affect all future battles taking place there (until they get replaced by another Location). The Location can give an advantage to a certain kind of Neopet, or can cause some side effect to any battles occurring there. Location cards are typically based upon the fantasy locations of the Neopets website.

===Fate (Orange)===
Fate cards are divided into two sub-categories: Curse and Quest. Curses are usually placed on a Neopet belonging to the opponent, and have a negative or detrimental effect on that Neopet. Because Curse cards typically remain in play, they can cripple a given Neopet&#x27;s ability to perform effectively. Quest cards affect all parts of the game, and are (usually) neutral.

===Constellation (Dark Blue)===
Constellation cards represent constellations in the sky which impact play in some way. For example, a given Constellation might confer an additional power to the Neopets in play, or otherwise might change the game in some fashion. Wizards of the Coast has not given any official rules regarding how constellation cards are to be played in the game, but popular rule sets online (most notably in player-created &quot;guilds&quot; on the Neopets website) considered them similar to Magic&#x27;s enchantments and thus keep them in play when they are played.

==Expansions==
The &quot;Neopets Trading Card Game&quot; has seen a series of expansions, with each release including new cards and in many cases, new categories of cards. Only three Neopets species did not make it into the TCG, as produced by Wizards of the Coast: Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok. Checklists can be accessed if players have a Neopets user account.

=== Base set ===
The first &quot;Neopets&quot; card set was simply an introductory 234-card set, with no prevailing theme whatsoever. This set introduced the card types Basic Neopet, Experienced Neopet, Hero, Villain, Item, Equipment, and &quot;Something Has Happened!&quot;. The Basic Neopet types that were introduced were Aishas, Korbats, Myncis, Scorchios, Shoyrus, Kacheeks, Acaras, Lupes, Wockies, Poogles, Eyries, and Grarrls.

===&quot;Battle For Meridell&quot;===
This expansion&#x27;s release was coordinated with an online plot/war, which was set in the virtual feudal-themed land of Meridell. Thus, the 140 cards in this set were designed with a Middle Ages-like style. This expansion introduced ten new species of Neopets, (Basic Type: Blumaroo, Draik, Gelert, Ixi, Meerca, Quiggle, Skeith, Uni, Usul, and Zafara) in addition to the Location card type.

===&quot;The Return of Dr. Sloth&quot;===
Intending to be tied into an online plot, this set was released in 2004 &amp; the online tie-in was delayed until early 2008 due to workload. This set totaled 100 cards. This expansion&#x27;s theme was space, providing players with futuristic and robotic items and equipment. Six new Neopet species made their debut in this expansion (Basic Type: Cybunny, Grundo, Jetsam, Jubjub, and Kougra).

===&quot;Mystery Island&quot;===
Based upon a tropical island locale, this 100-card expansion provided no new card types, but did introduce four new Neopet species, including the Pteri and Techo (other Basic Type: Krawk and Peophin). The related plot was the Secret of the Volcano mystery plot in Fall 2003, but the plot and the expansion were not released together.

===&quot;Hannah and the Ice Caves&quot;===
Revolving around a central popular game character known as Hannah the Usul, a substantial plot was released on the Neopets website along with this 150-card set; it was also the first set to have &quot;secret&quot; cards (5 Jelly cards 151/150-Jelly Poogle, 152/150-Jelly Shoyru, 153/150-Jelly World, 154/150-Jelly Puppyblew, and 155/150-Orange Jelly). The locale for this expansion, released in October 2004, was a wintry, icy environment. A game is also based upon the plot of this expansion of the same name, and is currently online at the Neopets website. This expansion introduced the Basic Neopets known as the Bori, and the Bruce (other Basic Type: Elephante, Flotsam, Kyrii, and Moehog). One new card type was released: Fates.

===&quot;Curse of Maraqua&quot;===
This 120-card expansion revolved around the underwater city of Maraqua, which was rebuilt during the plot of the same name on the Neopets website. Four new Neopet species were released with this set, including the Yurble (other Basic Type: Chomby, Lenny, and Tuskaninny).

===&quot;Lost Desert&quot;===
This 100-card expansion took players to the shifting sands of the Lost Desert. Basic Neopets released in this expansion are the Ruki, the Kau, and the Tonu. Site-wise, there was a plot and war revolving around this expansion.

=== &quot;The Darkest Faerie&quot; ===
This 150-card expansion (with 5 secret cards) featured several cards relating to the PlayStation 2 game, including several familiar characters from previous sets. The most notable of these were the Darkest Faerie, the Dark Faerie Sisters, and the Werelupe King. This expansion also introduced another new type of card, the Constellation (Basic Type: Buzz, Koi, and Nimmo). Oddly, this expansion was absent of any Fates.

Secret cards: 151- Amulet of Thilg, 152- Bewitched Ring, 153- Fyora, Tower Guardian, 154- The Hidden Tower, 155- Wand of Ultanova.

===&quot;Travels in Neopia&quot;===
This &quot;Neopets&quot; card expansion is actually a re-packaging of 200 cards from previous card sets. This includes favorite cards, as well as Neopets from each and every known Neopet species; 3 exceptions from the list of 54- Gnorbu, Ogrin, and Xweetok (introduced Basic Type: Hissi, Kiko, and Lutari). Only one color for each Basic species was included. The general theme of this set is about encouraging fans to re-live past plots, or, for those new to &quot;Neopets&quot;, catch up to them with some of the more well-known aspects of the series. There was barely any publicity at all related to this expansion.

===&quot;The Haunted Woods&quot;===
The newest expansion, featuring 100 cards with a spooky theme. Cards are related to ghosts, werewolves, and zombies, among others. This deck is associated with the plot, Tale of Woe; where a village has fallen under a curse, and only the Neopets can determine what happened to the townsfolk. There are no new Basic Type cards, although they did fill out the basic 4 colors for the Lenny and Tonu. Special color versions are included for Acara, Aisha, Cybunny, and Korbat. As with previous recent releases, this release appears to be been done with a minimum amount of publicity. This is the last expansion produced by Wizards of the Coast.

==&quot;Hubrid&#x27;s Hero Heist&quot;==
A game was created to tie in with the TCG, and it was named &quot;Hubrid&#x27;s Hero Heist&quot;. It features several Neopian heroes being captured by Hubrid Nox and the player, as the Poogle Apprentice, is tasked to save these heroes. The heroes which the player saves are, in order of saving, Magnus the Torch, Jeran, Master Vex, Illusen, Jerdana, and finally, Fyora the Faerie Queen.

== Reception ==

This is the band&#x27;s best batch of songs since &quot;Goddamnit&quot;, and although taken from disparate sources, the record has the feel of a long-player.&quot;

<text>Augustana College is a private Lutheran college in Rock Island, Illinois, United States. The college enrolls approximately 2,350 students. Its campus is adjacent to the Mississippi River and covers of hilly, wooded land.

==History==
Augustana College was founded as Augustana College and Theological Seminary in 1860 by the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod. Located first in Chicago, it moved to Paxton, Illinois, in 1863 and to Rock Island, Illinois, its current home, in 1875.

After 1890, an increasingly large Swedish American community in America promoted a new institutional structure, including a lively Swedish-language press, many new churches, several colleges, and a network of ethnic organizations. The result was to foster a sense of Swedishness with pride in the United States. Thus, there emerged a self-confident Americanized generation. Augustana College put itself in the lead of the movement to affirm Swedish American identity. Early on all the students had been born in Sweden but by 1890 the second generation of American-born students predominated. They typically had white-collar or professional backgrounds; few were the sons and daughters of farmers and laborers. These middle class youth developed an idealized view of Sweden, characterized by romanticism, patriotism, and idealism, just like their counterparts across the Atlantic. The new generation was especially proud of the Swedish contributions to American democracy and of the creation of a republic that promised liberty and destroyed the menace of slavery.

The college grew by donation of on the south in 1886 and purchase, enabled by donation of C.J.A. Ericson, of 10–12 acres to the north in 1899.

In 1947, when Conrad Bergendoff was college president, the Augustana Seminary formally separated from Augustana College and became an independent body. It remained on the Rock Island campus until the 1960s, when the Seminary moved to Chicago. It merged with other Lutheran seminaries to form the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago.

==Campus==

===Academic buildings===

Old Main was constructed between 1884 and 1893. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On August 2, 2010, the New Science Building was officially named the Robert A. and Patricia K. Hanson Hall of Science after Robert Hanson, a former John Deere CEO. Hanson, who donated $8 million to the college, credits his success in life to his time spent at Augustana. The science building, dedicated in 1998 and enlarged in 2019, is the largest academic building serving approximately 700 students in 17 majors, minors and concentrations. The Hanson Hall of Science&#x27;s facilities and resources include seven classrooms, 35 laboratories (including a cadaver lab), a 400 MHz liquid-and solid-state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, instrumentation for X-ray powder crystallography and a fully functioning greenhouse.

In October 2021, Augustana dedicated the Peter J. Lindberg, M.D., Center for Health and Human Performance in honor of alumnus Peter J. Lindberg. The 52,000-square-foot Lindberg Center is home to the college&#x27;s new kinesiology program and growing public health program, as well as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming/diving and new water polo teams.

===Residential complexes===

Augustana has five traditional residence halls: Andreen Hall, Erickson Residence Center, Seminary Hall, Swanson Commons, and Westerlin Residence Center. All five of these residence halls are coeducational. The majority of first-year and sophomore-year students typically reside in one of these five residence halls. For juniors, Augustana also offers Transitional Living Areas (TLAs), apartment-like complexes or traditional off-campus houses administered by the college&#x27;s Office of Residential Life. These areas usually have 2–6 students who share a bathroom, a kitchen, and other living spaces.

===Fryxell Geology Museum===
The Fryxell Geology Museum, named after Augustana geologist Fritiof Fryxell, features a large collection of dinosaurs and fossils, rocks and mineral specimens. Displays include a complete skeleton of a Platecarpus &quot;sea serpent&quot;, skulls of Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus, Apatosaurus, Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex and a 2-billion-year-old fossil. There is also a complete skeleton of Cryolophosaurus, a large, crested carnivorous dinosaur discovered in Antarctica in 1991 by Augustana paleontologist William Hammer. The museum is located in the Swenson Hall of Geosciences.

The Omicron chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1941. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America. (The chapter name &quot;Omicron&quot; was reused for the chapter installed at San José State University.)

==Athletics==
Augustana athletic teams are nicknamed as the Vikings. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW) for almost all of their sports since the 1946–47 academic year. The only current exception is women&#x27;s bowling, in which the Vikings are charter members of the single-sport Central Intercollegiate Bowling Conference (CIBC) that began competition in the 2019–20 season. The Vikings compete in a combined total of 25 male and female team sports, and five out of seven students compete in some form of varsity, club, or intramural sport. The Vikings previously competed as a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) from 1912–13 to 1936–37.

Augustana College competes in 28 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, eSports, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, water polo and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, eSports, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, water polo and wrestling;.

Between 1983 and 1986, the Augustana College football team won four consecutive Division III national championships under Coach Bob Reade. Coach Reade&#x27;s overall winning percentage of 87% is second only to Larry Kehres and Knute Rockne on the all-time list.

<text>Hohenberg Bros. Co. is a cotton trading company with headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1978, Julian Hohenberg sold the company to Cargill Inc and it was renamed Cargill Cotton.

==History==
Cargill Cotton’s roots in cotton merchandising trace back to 1818, when John and Eustace Ralli began trading cotton and other commodities in London. Over the next thirty years, the brothers&#x27; business interests began to focus predominantly on cotton from the East Indies. In 1851, Ralli Brothers was incorporated with offices in the United Kingdom, Calcutta, and Bombay.

In 1865, another cotton trading company, Smith, Coney and Barrat, was founded and soon became very successful. By the middle of the twentieth century, the firms had grown to become two of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading cotton merchants and in 1962 the two companies agreed to merge, forming Ralli Brothers and Coney.

Shortly after the formation of Smith, Coney, and Barrat, Adolphe and Morris Hohenberg formed their partnership in the United States to trade cotton and dry goods in 1879. Over the next hundred years, Hohenberg Brothers Cotton Company and Ralli Brothers and Coney grew to become two of the largest and most successful in the United States and the world.

At the time Cargill acquired Hohenberg Bros. Company in 1976, Ralli Bros. and Coney and Hohenberg each had established themselves as global leaders in the industry.

In 1981 Ralli Brothers and Coney was sold to Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Ralli Brothers and Coney&#x27;s strengths were in the trading of cotton from the Indian sub-continent and Africa, which complemented the fields of expertise, which Cargill Inc. already possessed through their Memphis, Tennessee, USA based cotton-trading company, Hohenberg Brothers Inc.

From these two small family ventures evolved one of the largest cotton merchandising concerns in the history of the world.

In 2002, after over 20 years of operating under both the Hohenberg and Ralli names, the name of the entire cotton operation was changed to Cargill Cotton. Thus the combination of strengths became complete as the cotton business unit assumed the name of its 100 billion-dollar parent company.

<doc id="1100330" wikidata="Q4446399" url="?curid=1100330" title="Sura (city)">
<text>Sura () was a city in the southern part of the area called by ancient Jewish sources [[Sura (city)|Babylonia]], located east of the Euphrates. It was well-known for its agricultural produce, which included grapes, wheat, and barley. It was also a major center of Torah scholarship and home of an important yeshiva—the [[Sura Academy]]—which, together with the yeshivas in Pumbedita and Nehardea, gave rise to the Babylonian Talmud.

==Location==
According to Sherira Gaon, Sura () was identical to the town of Mata Mehasya, which is also mentioned in the Talmud, but Mata Mehasya is cited in the Talmud many times, either as a nearby town or a suburb of Sura, and the Talmudist academy in Mata Mehasya served as a branch of Sura Academy, which was founded by Abba Arikha in the third century.

A contemporary Syriac source describes it as a town completely inhabited by Jews, situated between Māḥōzē and al-Hirah in the Sawad. A responsum of Natronai ben Hilai says that Sura was about from Harta D&#x27;Argiz, understood to be al-Hirah.

==History==
===Byzantine–Sasanian wars===
It was a [Byzantine] garrison of some importance in the Persian campaigns of Belisarius; and a full account is given of the circumstances under which it was taken and burned by Chosroes I. (A.D. 532), who, having marched three long days&#x27; journey from Circesium to Zenobia, along the course of the Euphrates, thence proceeded an equal distance up the river to Sura. Incidental mention of the bishop proves that it was then an episcopal see. (&quot;Procop. Bell. Pers.&quot; i. 18, ii. 5.) Its walls were so weak that it did not hold out more than half an hour; but it was afterwards more substantially fortified, by order of the emperor Justinian. (Id. &quot;de Aedificiis Justiniani&quot;, ii. 9.)&quot;

<text>Carl Heinrich Auspitz (2 September 1835 in Nikolsburg, Moravia – 22 May 1886 in Vienna) was a Jewish Austrian dermatologist. He was the husband of pianist Auguste Auspitz-Kólar (1843–1878).

He was a member of the famous Moravian-Austrian . Heinrich was a son of Jewish surgeon (1803, Nikolsburg 1880). His younger brother (1838, Nikolsburg 1907) was an Imperial &amp; Royal &quot;Generalmajor&quot; and writer. In 1840, Moritz was given a job at a Jewish hospital in Vienna, and allowed better education to his sons.

Trained at the University of Vienna, he specialized in dermatology and syphilis. He was part of the so-called Vienna School of Dermatology, and studied and worked with several eminent physicians of the time; Ernst Wilhelm (Ritter von) Brücke (1819, Berlin 1892), Karel &quot;(Carl)&quot; Freiherr von Rokytanský (1804, Bohemia 1878), Josef Škoda (1805, Bohemia 1881), Johann Ritter von Oppolzer (1808, Bohemia 1871), and Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra (1816, Moravia 1880).

In 1863 he became a privat-docent of dermatology and syphilis, and during the following year began work in the histological institute of Carl Wedl. In 1872 he was named director of the general policlinic, and from 1875 onward, was an associate professor at the university.

A pioneer in tissue pathology, he described the pinpoint bleeding on removal of a psoriasis scale that bears his name: &quot;Auspitz&#x27;s sign&quot;. In 1885 he published an article involving mycosis fungoides titled &quot;&quot;Ein Fall von Granuloma fungoides (Mycosis fungoides Alibert)&quot;.

Together with Philipp Josef Pick (1834-1910), he founded first German-language magazine for dermatology, the &quot;Archiv für Dermatologie und Syphilis&quot;&quot; (1869). In 1882 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In May 1886 he died from a heart condition, and was interred in the &quot;Wiener Zentralfriedhof&quot;.

== Award ==
Since 2005, the &quot;Heinrich Auspitz Preis&quot; has been awarded by the Wyeth and Pfizer Corporation Austria in order to promote scientific research in the field of dermatology.

<doc id="1100352" wikidata="Q219669" url="?curid=1100352" title="Al-Fatiha">
<text>Al-Fatiha () is the first chapter () of the Quran. It consists of seven verses (&quot;&quot;) which consist of a prayer for guidance and mercy. 

Al-Fatiha is recited in Muslim obligatory and voluntary prayers, known as &quot;salah&quot;. The primary literal meaning of the expression &quot;Al-Fatiha&quot; is &quot;The Opener/The Key&quot;.

==Background==
The most commonly accepted view about the origins of the &quot;surah&quot; is the view of Ibn Abbas, among others, that Al-Fatiha is a Meccan &quot;surah&quot;, although some believe that it is either a Medinan surah or was revealed in both Mecca and Medina. Most narrators recorded that al-Fātiḥah was the first complete Surah revealed to Muhammad.

The name Al-Fatiha (&quot;the Opener&quot;) could refer to the &quot;surah&quot; being the first in the Mus&#x27;hafs, the first to be recited in each &quot;rakat&quot; of &quot;salah&quot;, or to the manner of its usage in many Islamic traditions as an opening prayer. The word itself comes from the root (ف ت ح), which means &quot;to open, explain, disclose, conquer&quot;, etc. Al-Fatiha is also known by several other names, such as Al-Hamd (The Praise), As-Salah (The Prayer), Umm al-Kitab (Mother of the Book), Umm al-Quran (Mother of the Quran), Sab&#x27;a min al-Mathani (Seven Repeated Ones, from Quran ), and Ash-Shifa&#x27; (The Cure).

== Summary ==
Surah Al-Fatiha is narrated in the Hadith to have been divided into two halves between God and his servant (the person reciting), the first three verses being God&#x27;s half and last three being the servant&#x27;s. There is disagreement as to whether the &quot;Bismillah&quot; is the first verse of the &quot;surah,&quot; or even a verse in the first place. 

The chapter begins by praising God with the phrase and stating that it is God who is the lord of the worlds (verse 1/2), that He is the Most Gracious and Most Merciful (verse 2/3), and that He is and will be the true owner of everything and everyone on the Day of Judgement (verse 3/4).

&quot;If you tried to count Allah&#x27;s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Indeed, humankind is truly unfair, ˹totally˺ ungrateful&quot; ().

The final three verses, which comprise the servant&#x27;s half, begin with the servant stating that they worship and seek only God&#x27;s help (verse 4/5), asking Him to guide them to the &quot;Sirat al-Mustaqim&quot; (the Straight Path) of those who God has been bountiful to, and not of those who have earned his anger (verses 5-6/6-7).

Most Muslim commentators have interpreted these verses in a more general sense and not referring exclusively to any specific group of people. However, some Muslim commentators believe Jews and Christians are examples of those evoking God&#x27;s anger and those who went astray, respectively.

== Verses and meaning ==

[&quot;bi-smi-llahi-r-raḥmāni-r-raḥīm(i)&quot;] 
 In the name of God, the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. 

[&quot;al-ḥamdu li-llāhi rabbi-l-ʿālamīn(a)&quot;]

[&quot;ar-raḥmāni-r-raḥīm(i)&quot;] 
 the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

==Benefits and virtues==
Muslims attribute special significance to some &quot;surahs&quot; for their virtues and benefits () described in the hadith. Acceptance of the different hadith varies between Sunni and Shia Muslims, and there is a variety of terms to classify the different levels of confirmed authenticity of a hadith. However, both Sunnis and Shia believe Al-Fatiha to be one of the greatest &quot;surahs&quot; in the Quran, and a cure for several diseases and poisons, both spiritual and mental.

<text>Lieutenant General Sylvain Trần Văn Minh (19 August 1923, in Saigon, French Indochina – 31 May 2009, in Nice, France) was a Vietnamese diplomat and a general of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

In 1942, he passed the entry exam for the St Cyr/St Maixent Military Academy organized in Tong, Indochina. From 1943 to 1945, Lieutenant Minh served with the 9th R.I.C. During this period, he participated in operations in Central and North Vietnam, most notably in Cha Pa. After the Japanese coup of 9 March 1945, he accompanied General Alessandri&#x27;s troops in the retreat to China. In 1946, he was part of the French troops that retook Dien Bien Phu. From there, he eventually made his way to Saigon, travelling on the Mekong River through Luang Prabang and Vientiane. Deployed to the 22nd R.I.C. (1946–47), he was in charge of protecting military convoys between Saigon and Dalat.

Minh was named Directeur des Etudes (Chánh Sở Nghiên Cứu – Director of Intelligence) for the Governor of North Vietnam, Nghiêm Xuân Thiện. 1950 found him in Paris studying at the War Academy (École de Guerre à Paris). Upon his return to Vietnam, he worked at the newly formed State of Vietnam&#x27;s Ministry of Defense. Two years later, he served on the Chief of Staff. During this time, he worked with General de Lattre de Tassigny in the &quot;Vietnamization&quot; of the Corps Expéditionnaire Français. After participating in Operation Atlante, he was promoted to Commander of the South Sector. 

In 1955, Colonel Minh was one of the French delegates at the Geneva Convention. After the accords were signed, he returned home to take command of the first military region in South Vietnam. Late 1955, he was promoted to Général de brigade (Brigadier). A year later, the 33-year-old Minh was promoted to Général de division (Major General). From 1957 to 1959, he served as Commandant of the Dalat military academy. In 1960, President Ngô Đình Diệm named him Inspector General the National Defense, a post he held until 1963.

In 1964–65, he was the Chief of General Staff and in 1965, Minister of Defense. The last position he held was Ambassador of the Republic of Vietnam to Tunis, Tunisia from 1971 until 30 April 1975, when Saigon fell.

<text>Daniel Eugene Ruettiger (born August 23, 1948) is an American motivational speaker and author who played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. His early life and career at Notre Dame were the inspiration for the 1993 film &quot;Rudy&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===

Daniel Eugene Ruettiger (nicknamed &quot;Rudy&quot;) was born on August 23, 1948, in Joliet, Illinois. He was the third of 14 children and grew up with his German American family. Ruettiger did not excel scholastically, at least in part due to dyslexia. He attended Joliet Catholic High School and played for locally famous football coach Gordie Gillespie.

Ruettiger joined the United States Navy after high school, serving as a yeoman on a communications command ship for two years; then he worked in a power plant for two years. Ruettiger applied to Notre Dame and was rejected due to his low high school grades. He enrolled and attended nearby Holy Cross College, and after two years was accepted as a student at Notre Dame on his fourth try, in the fall of 1974. It was during his time studying at Holy Cross that Ruettiger discovered he had dyslexia.

===College===
Ruettiger harbored a dream to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, despite being undersized at and . Head coach Ara Parseghian encouraged walk-on players from the student body. For example, Notre Dame&#x27;s 1969 starting center, Mike Oriard, was a walk-on who was eventually nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship and earned an NFL contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.

After tremendous financial help from his father, Ruettiger earned a place on the Notre Dame scout team, a squad that helps the varsity team practice for games. Merv Johnson was the coach who was instrumental in keeping Ruettiger on as a scout-team player.

After the 1974 season, Notre Dame coach Parseghian stepped down and former Green Bay Packers coach Dan Devine was named head coach. In Ruettiger&#x27;s last opportunity to play for Notre Dame at home, Devine put him into a game as defensive end against Georgia Tech on November 8, 1975. In the movie &quot;Rudy&quot;, Devine is given a somewhat antagonistic role, not wanting Ruettiger to dress for his last game. However, in the real life scenario, it was Devine who came up with the idea to dress Ruettiger. During the final home game of Ruettiger&#x27;s senior season with the Fighting Irish, he recorded a sack, which is all his Notre Dame stat line has shown. Ruettiger actually played for three plays: a kickoff, an incomplete pass, and on the third play (the game&#x27;s final play), he sacked Georgia Tech quarterback Rudy Allen. Ruettiger was carried off the field by his teammates following the game, the first player in Notre Dame history to be honored in this way. Only one other player has received this recognition: Marc Edwards in 1995.

===Feature film===

Ruettiger set up a successful maintenance company and also sold real estate. In 1986, he moved back to South Bend, Indiana, and decided to sell his story to be made into a film. Ruettiger&#x27;s story was told in the 1993 feature film &quot;Rudy&quot;, which starred actor Sean Astin in the title role. The film was written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, both of whom were involved in &quot;Hoosiers&quot;. Ruettiger appeared in a cameo as a fan behind his father, played by Ned Beatty, during the final game scenes.

Ruettiger has said that the movie is &quot;92% true.&quot; The players did not lay down their jerseys; rather, the team captain and one other player requested that he be allowed to play. Dan Devine is given a somewhat antagonistic role in the film, but Devine was actually one of Ruettiger&#x27;s biggest motivators to return to the team. The groundskeeper named Fortune is a combination of three different people.

=== Later life ===
Ruettiger is a motivational speaker and author.

In 2011, Ruettiger was charged with securities fraud in connection with his role as Chairman of Rudy Beverage, Inc. The government alleged a pump-and-dump scheme. A settlement of the case required Ruettiger to pay $382,866 in fines. In his 2011 book, &quot;Rudy: My Story&quot;, Ruettiger writes of his dealings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and settlement for alleged securities fraud, stating, &quot;I fell into the same obvious trap the rest of the country had fallen into in all of those boom years&quot;, and, &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have been chasing the money.&quot;

In 2017, at age 68, Ruettiger was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Highland, Utah.

==Honors, recognition, and awards==
On October 14, 2005, Ruettiger appeared at a pep rally before the 2005 USC vs. Notre Dame football game, which Notre Dame ultimately lost in the last few seconds.

The inaugural 2007 College Football Rudy Award was held on January 8, 2008, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. The College Football Rudy Award was created by the Rudy Foundation and honors Division I football players who demonstrate what Ruettiger refers to as the &quot;Four Cs&quot;: character, courage, contribution, and commitment as a member of their team. A similar award for high school students was created in 2009. Trusted Sports and Ruettiger launched the High School Football &quot;Rudy&quot; Awards, which aim to uncover the &quot;Rudy&quot; on every high school football team in America. Inspired by the College Football Rudy Awards, three finalists were announced on February 3, 2010. The winner, Calob Leindecker of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, received a college scholarship totaling $10,000. Two runners-up, Kyle Weafer of Kansas and Justin Ray Duke of Texas each received $5,000 scholarships.

In July 2009, Ruettiger was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity at the Grand Conclave in San Antonio, Texas.

Ruettiger received honorary doctoral degrees from Holy Cross College, Mercy University, and Long Island University. He has been given key to the city at numerous cities across the nation along with special proclamations for his inspiration, commitment, and human spirit; one such proclamation from the Governor of Nevada announced an Official Rudy Award Day.

<doc id="1100377" wikidata="Q1394907" url="?curid=1100377" title="False Creek">
<text>False Creek () is a short narrow inlet in the heart of Vancouver, separating the Downtown and West End neighbourhoods from the rest of the city. It is one of the four main bodies of water bordering Vancouver, along with English Bay (of which it is an inland extension), Burrard Inlet, and the Fraser River. Granville Island is located within the inlet.

George Henry Richards named False Creek during his hydrographic survey of 1856–1863. While travelling along the south side of the Burrard Inlet, Richards thought he was traversing a creek; upon discovering his error, he gave the inlet its current name.

The inlet opens into the English Bay to its northwest, and is surrounded by the Downtown and West End neighbourhoods in the north, Strathcona in the east, and Mount Pleasant, Fairview and Kitsilano in the south. Science World is located at its easternmost end, along with BC Place Stadium and the Georgia Viaduct. Proceeding east to west, it is crossed by the Cambie, Granville, and Burrard bridges. The Canada Line rapid transit tunnel crosses underneath False Creek just west of the Cambie Bridge. In 1986, it was the location of the Expo 86 World&#x27;s Fair.

False Creek South is a neighbourhood that runs along south shore roughly between the Granville and Cambie bridges. Further east, Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) runs roughly from Cambie Street to Main Street.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===
Human settlement in the Lower Fraser region began between 8000 and 10 000 years ago, following the retreat of the Sumas Glacier at the end of the last ice age. The settlement by peoples now known as the Coast Salish predates the arrival of salmon in the river 4500–5000 years ago, an occurrence that took place symbiotically with the emergence of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar ecosystems between 4000 and 5000 years before the present day. According to Squamish- author and historian Lee Maracle, Vancouver was inhabited by &quot;Downriver Halkomelem&quot; speaking peoples, the Tsleil-Waututh.

First contact between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of present-day Vancouver occurred in June 1792. By 1812, Halkomelem peoples had survived three large epidemics from foreign illnesses such as smallpox, introduced through trading routes, including a 1782 outbreak that killed two-thirds of the population. It has been estimated that shortly before the time of first contact and these epidemics, the indigenous population of the Lower Fraser was over 100,000.

===Early colonial period===
An 1830 Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company census documented 8954 indigenous inhabitants in the region, although the census probably omitted some settlements. As a result of epidemics, the population of the Tsleil-Waututh was reduced to 41 individuals by 1812, who invited the neighbouring Squamish to reside in Burrard Inlet.

Shortly after that, a group of Tsleil-Waututh led by Khatsalahnough, a leader from Lil&#x27;wat (near present-day Pemberton), occupied present-day False Creek. At this time, there were large sandbars at its entrance. False Creek, which lies in Musqueam territory, was a shared waterway; in addition to the Tsleil-Waututh, the Squamish inhabited False Creek as well, occupying it year-round.

Before European settlement, False Creek extended as far east as what is now Clark Drive. With land reclamation extending into Burrard Inlet and False Creek for port and industrial uses, the landscape began to change dramatically. Once a vital source for Tsleil-Waututh, Musqueam, and Squamish food supplies such as sea asparagus, berries, camas, oysters, clams, wild cabbage, and mushrooms, False Creek became polluted with sewage and toxic effluent from sawmills and other industries. As a result, one nickname for False Creek was &quot;Shit Creek&quot;.

From 1894 to 1905 Alfred Wallace built ships on the north shore of False Creek next to Granville Street Bridge.

In 1913, the Squamish residents of the Kitsilano Reserve, on the False Creek sandbar, were forced to relocate. According to Maracle, the settlement was burned down following the forced evacuation. In 1916, the sandbar on which this settlement was located was built into Granville Island to create new industrial land. In 1917, the eastern basin of False Creek was infilled to create land for the Canadian Northern Railway&#x27;s Pacific Central Station. Talk of draining and filling the inlet to Granville Street continued into the 1950s, but that never occurred.

===Industrial period===

The False Creek area was the industrial heartland of Vancouver through to the 1950s, and was home to many sawmills and small port operations. As industry shifted to other areas, the vicinity around False Creek started to deteriorate. In 1960, BC Forest Products plant and lumber storage facility on the south side of False Creek caught fire in Vancouver&#x27;s first-ever five-alarm blaze. Every piece of firefighting equipment and all of Vancouver&#x27;s firefighters fought the blaze for hours, but the facility was totally destroyed.

Walter Hardwick, a geography professor at UBC, first elected to City Council in 1968, led the City&#x27;s redevelopment team and helped secure the participation of the Federal Government, which owned Granville Island. A major public involvement and co-design process followed which established public priorities for an accessible waterfront seawall; mixed-tenure housing including market condominiums, co-op and low-income housing and live-aboard marinas; and a vibrant waterfront market. These plans were formalized in a 1972 Official Development Plan. The form and mix of development were revolutionary for Vancouver at the time. A third of the site was set aside for 40 units/acre housing with the balance converted to park, waterfront and community uses.

===Expo 86 and after===
The North Shore of False Creek (NFC) was further transformed in the 1980s, as it took centre stage during Expo 86. Following Expo, the Province sold the NFC site to Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing whose company Concord Pacific successfully marketed Vancouver in Asia, as a place for investment and migration. With the province enabling strata titles, a high-rise condominium boom soon followed, with Downtown Vancouver&#x27;s population soaring from around 6,000 throughout the 1970s and 1980s to over 43,000 in 2006.

The 1991 Official Development Plan enabled significant new density commensurate with the provision of significant public amenities including street front shops and services, parks, school sites, community centres, daycares, co-op and low-income housing. Since then, most of the north shore has become a new neighbourhood of dense housing (about 100 units/acre), adding some 50 000 new residents to Vancouver&#x27;s downtown peninsula.

On December 1, 1998, Vancouver City Council adopted a set of Blue ways policies and guidelines stating the vision of a waterfront city where land and water combine to meet the environmental, cultural and economic needs of the City and its people in a sustainable, equitable, high quality manner.

Southeast False Creek (SEFC) is the neighbourhood designated by Cambie, Main, West 2nd Avenue, and False Creek. The 2010 Olympic Village, for athlete housing and logistics of the Winter Olympics, is found in Southeast False Creek. As of 2021, the population exceeded 3,000.

==Sports and recreation==
False Creek is a very popular boating area for many different activities including rowing, dragon boating, canoeing, kayaking, public ferries, charter ships, and visiting pleasure boats. It has 10 marinas with berths for 1500 watercraft and several paddling clubs or boat rental facilities. Since 1986, the creek has been the venue for the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival and other paddling events.

==Transportation==
Aquabus and False Creek Ferries are two ferry companies that operate scheduled services daily to and from multiple points along False Creek. In addition to three bridges and multiple bus routes, False Creek can also be crossed via the Canada Line in a tunnel between Olympic Village station on the South shore and Yaletown-Roundhouse station to the North.

==Environmental issues==
There are regular reports of pollution problems in False Creek, and there are occasional warnings that the water is not safe for swimming, particular at the eastern end which is least affected by tidal inflow and outflow.

Because of connections between Vancouver&#x27;s storm-sewer and sanitary-sewer systems, heavy rains may cause raw sewage to discharge directly into False Creek.

===Impact on wildlife===
Several decades following the suspension of industrial activity in the area, a number of shore and seabirds such as cormorants, ducks, herons, kingfishers, owls, geese, crows, and gulls have returned, as well as harbour seals. In an unusual sighting, in May 2010 a grey whale entered False Creek and traversed its length before returning to the open waters of the Strait of Georgia.

Factors working against the further return of wildlife include residual industrial contaminants, spillage from the sewer overflow system into the creek, and the seawall that constrains much of the shoreline with little habitat value. The city has attempted to recreate the natural shoreline in some areas and is working to phase out the antiquated sewer overflow system.

==Architecture and urban planning==

===False Creek South===
The south shore of False Creek has had quite a diverse history of land uses since its founding. South False Creek went from being an industrial park, in the late 1800s and mid-1900s, to being the populous residential area that it is today. The development of this area, beginning anew in the 1970s, occurred at a critical time in Vancouver&#x27;s history when citizens were organising support for a new picture of the city, one that broke away from the standardized utilitarian cities that were so popular in North America and, instead, pushed for a more liveable and diverse built environment.

The result is a medium-density area with a variety of architectural designs, ownership opportunities, recreational activities, and modes of transportation, which allows for easier mobility within the community and a more picturesque landscape. 

False Creek south is home to False Creek Elementary School. 

False Creek consists of 70% social housing and 30% leasehold apartments and condos.

* 30% low income below market (subsidised) rent. Including Metro Vancouver Housing, Portland Hotel Society, other organisation and societies.
* 30% co-op housing rent geared to income but still quite subsidised (below market)
* 10% housing for people with special needs (below market rents)
* 30% standard market rent apartments and leasehold condos.

All of False Creek South is on Leasehold land which is owned by the City of Vancouver.

Southeast False Creek (Olympic Village) consists mostly of market-rate apartments and modern condos with a few co-ops and social housing.

===North False Creek===

The north shore of False Creek, on the downtown peninsula, has undergone multiple stages of development since its purchase by the province from the Canadian Pacific Railway in the early 1980s. Before the BC Cabinet bought the land of North False Creek to begin development for Expo &#x27;86, the land was used for industrial purposes. Provincial leaders developed a plan to build a sports stadium (BC Place), commercial outlets, and high-density residences on the newly cleared land. 

False Creek North is home to Crosstown Elementary School as well as Elsie Roy Elementary School.

<text>Belkovich is a large lunar impact crater of the form termed a walled plain. The formation has been heavily eroded by a history of subsequent impacts, leaving it reshaped, worn, and the features softened and rounded. Belkovich is located along the northeastern limb of the Moon, and so its visibility is subject to libration effects. From the Earth this crater is viewed from the side, making it difficult to view it in detail.

Belkovich intrudes into the northeast portion of the Mare Humboldtianum, and the mare area outside the rim consists of hilly, irregular surface that covers much of the northern half of the lunar mare. The younger crater Hayn intrudes into the northwest rim of Belkovich, and the satellite crater Belkovich K lies across the northeast rim. In the south, the lava-flooded crater Belkovich A cuts across the southern rim, and its western rim is overlain in turn by the small, bowl-shaped Belkovich B.

Apart from the intersecting crater formations, the outer rim of Belkovich has been degraded and reshaped until it now consists of a roughly circular range of mountains and hills. The northern and northeastern parts of the crater floor and rim is an irregular surface of many small hillocks. The southeast quadrant of the interior is nearly as irregular, and contains a number of small craterlets. Only in the western part of the floor is the surface relatively flat. From here a slender rille extends to the east-southeast before bending to the southeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Belkovich.

<doc id="1100395" wikidata="Q6025584" url="?curid=1100395" title="Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians">
<text>Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians or Trinidadian and Tobagonian Indians are people of Indian origin who are nationals of Trinidad and Tobago, whose ancestors came from India and the wider subcontinent beginning in 1845 during the period of colonization.

Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians are a subgroup of Indo-Caribbean people, which is a subgroup of the wider Indian diaspora. Generally, most Indians in Trinidad and Tobago can trace their ancestry back to Northern India especially the Bhojpur and Awadh regions, which lies in the Gangetic plains, a plain that is located between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers and faces the mountain ranges of the Himalayas, the Kaimur, and the Vindhyas. However, some Indians may trace their ancestry to other parts of South Asia, notably southern India. Indians first arrived in Trinidad and Tobago as indentured laborers from India through the Indian indenture system from 1845 till 1917, and some Indians and other South Asians, along with their families, later came as entrepreneurs, businesspeople, religious leaders, doctors, engineers, and other professional occupations beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing till present day. Some Indians from many other Caribbean nations, such as Guyana, Grenada, Martinique, and Saint Croix, also immigrated to Trinidad and Tobago.

Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians are the largest ethnic group in Trinidad and Tobago, identified by the official census, about 35.43% of the population in 2011.

==History==

In his book &quot;Perspectives on the Caribbean: A Reader In Culture, History, and Representation&quot;, Philip W. Scher cites figures by Steven Vertovec, Professor of Anthropology; Of 94,135 Indian immigrants to Trinidad, between 1874 and 1917, 50.7 percent were from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, 24.4 percent hailed from Oudh State, 13.5 percent were from Bihar Province and lesser numbers from various other parts of the British Raj, such as the Madras Presidency, Bengal Presidency, Central Provinces, Chota Nagpur Division, Bombay Presidency, and Punjab Province. Out of 134,118 indentured labourers from India, 5,000 who left from the Port of Madras distinguished themselves as &quot;Madrasi&quot; and the immigrants who left from the Port of Calcutta distinguished themselves as &quot;Kalakatiyas&quot;. However, this did not equate to their ethnolinguistic group. While, most Indians who left from the Port of Madras were Tamils (Madrasis), not all were ethnic-Madrasis, some were Telugu, Kannadiga, Malayali, Gondi, Kodava, Tulu, or Deccani, and most Indians who left from the Port of Calcutta were not ethnic-Bengalis (Kalakatiyas), but they were Purabias (Bhojpuri and Awadhi), however there were small numbers of Bengalis, as well as small numbers of Maithils, Magahis, Baghelis, Brajis, Bundelis, Kannaujis, Kauravis, Pashtuns, Nagpuris, Kurukhs, Haryanvis, Gujaratis, Marwari, Sadans, Chhattisgarhis, Kashmiris, Dogras, Punjabis, Marathis, Odias, Garhwalis, Kumaonis, Madheshis, Parsees, Assamese, Newars, Tharus and Khas who came via the Port of Calcutta.

Many were people who were escaping poverty in India and seeking employment offered by the British for jobs either as indentured labourers, workers or educated servicemen, primarily, between 1845 and 1917.

The demand for Indian indentured labourers increased dramatically after the abolition of slavery in 1834. They were sent, sometimes in large numbers, to plantation colonies producing high-value crops such as sugar in Africa and the Caribbean.

==Religion==


According to the most recent census (2011) conducted in Trinidad and Tobago, Hinduism is the religion followed by a plurality of Indo-Trinidadians. The breakdown of religious affiliation for Indo-Trinidadians is as follows - 
# Hinduism – 49.54%
# Islam – 11.64%
#Pentecostalism/Evangelicalism/Full Gospel – 9.67%
# Roman Catholicism – 6.48%
# Not Stated – 6.30%
# Other – 5.81%
# Presbyterianism/Congregationalism – 5.68%
# None – 1.04%
# Spiritual Baptist – 0.96% 
# Seventh-day Adventist Church – 0.91%
# Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses – 0.73%
# Anglicanism – 0.56%
# Trinidad Orisha – 0.31%
# Other Baptists – 0.21%
# Sikhism – 0.06%
# Methodism – 0.05%
# Rastafari – 0.02%
# Moravian Church – 0.007%

Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago are represented by several sects, organizations and entities the largest of which is the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, a Sanātanī Hindu organization. Other Hindu organizations and sects include SWAHA International, Arya Samaj, Chinmaya Mission, Kabir panth, ISKCON, the Sathya Sai Baba movement, Shirdi Sai Baba movement, Ramanandi Sampradaya, Seunariani (Sieunarini/Siewnaraini/Shiv Narayani), Aughar (Aghor/Owghur), Kali Mai (Madrasi), Murugan (Kaumaram), Bharat Sevashram Sangha, Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat (Radha Madhav), Ganapathi Sachchidananda movement, Divine Life Society, Brahma Kumaris, and Blue Star.

A majority of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian Muslims are Sunni, however there are notable Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities. The major Muslim organisation representing Muslims in Trinidad and Tobago is the Anjuman Sunnat-ul-Jamaat Association (ASJA). Other Islamic organizations include the Trinidad Muslim League, Darul Uloom, Ummah T&amp;T, the Muslim Federation, and the Tackveeyatul Islamic Association.

The Sikh community in Trinidad and Tobago, numbering at about 300, consists of the descendants of the few Punjabis who came during the indentureship period, Punjabi Sikhs who came in the twentieth and twenty-first century, and Sindhi Hindus and Punjabi Hindus who also came in the twentieth and twenty-first century and who are, in addition to being Hindu, Nanakpanthis, followers of the Sikh Guru Nanak. The Sikhs have a gurdwara (temple) in Tunapuna dating back to 1929.

==Politics==
Most Indo-Trinidadians have traditionally given their political support to parties opposed to the People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) which has historically been perceived as a Christian African-Creole party. Voting patterns amongst Indo-Trinidadians have also been influenced by religion where, for periods of time Muslim Indo-Trinidadians and non-Presbyterian Christian Indo-Trinidadians supported the PNM because the prevailing parties for Indo-Trinidadians – the PDP, DLP, and ULF were felt to be Hindu and Presbyterian Indian dominated parties. With the advent of the NAR and then the UNC this polarization by religion has been on the decline however its existence is still felt with the UNC fielding a Muslim candidate in every election for the San Juan/Barataria seat since 1995 owing to the presence of a large Indo-Trinidadian Muslim population within this constituency.

Notable Indo-Trinidadian politicians include:
*Basdeo Panday – first prime minister of Indo-Trinidadian descent and the first Hindu to hold the office
*Kamla Persad-Bissesar – first female prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago
*Noor Mohamed Hassanali – first Muslim head of state in the Western Hemisphere and the first Muslim and Indo-Trinidadian to hold the office of President of Trinidad and Tobago (1987–1997)
*Christine Kangaloo – first female president of Trinidad and Tobago of Indian descent 
*Rudranath Capildeo – Leader of the opposition at the time of independence
*Bhadase Sagan Maraj – Leader of the Parliamentary wing (1958–1960)
*Ashford Sinanan – Opposition leader (1951–1956); West Indies Federation Opposition Leader (1958–1961)
*Rudranath Capildeo – party leader (1960–1969)

<text>Bellot is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the southwest edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It lies between the craters Goclenius to the northwest and Crozier to the southeast. To the southwest is Colombo, and to the west is Magelhaens.

This crater is circular and bowl-shaped, with a small interior floor with inner sides that slope down relatively smoothly to the bottom. The inner walls have a higher albedo than the nearby lunar mare.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bellot.

<text>Bernoulli is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeast part of the Moon. It lies to the south of the crater Messala, and east of Geminus.

This formation is nearly circular with several slight outward bulges around the perimeter. There is a sunken depression along part of the southern wall, forming an outward triangular bulge in the rim. The rim is highest along the eastern side, climbing to 4 km. At the midpoint of the crater floor is a central peak formation.

<doc id="1100407" wikidata="Q56273717" url="?curid=1100407" title="Ford Territory (Australia)">
<text>The Ford Territory is a mid-size crossover SUV built by Ford Australia that was introduced in April 2004 and produced until 7 October 2016. It was the only SUV built in Australia and Ford&#x27;s first large three-row crossover SUV. It was originally based on the EA169 platform introduced by the EA Falcon and its internal project codename was E265. It won various automotive awards and was the first SUV to win the Australian title of &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year in 2004, due to its acceptable handling and child carrying capacity.

Ford Australia reportedly spent A$500 million on developing this vehicle over a four-year period. Many Australian toolmakers were lauded for their cost competitiveness in keeping this cost so low, not as cheap as the Japanese, but much lower than Detroit-based cars. Apart from being the first and only Australian-made SUV, it was also the first local vehicle to feature electronic stability control.

==Design==
Both rear-wheel drive (RWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) configurations were available for the Australian market. AWD models had an optional anti-lock braking system to control the car&#x27;s motion downhill.

Reflecting its SUV design, seating capacity in the Territory was for either five (two rows) or seven (three rows) passengers, making it excellent for large families with children. All seating rows were arranged in a &quot;theatre style&quot;, whereby the first row was the lowest and the last row was the highest. The middle and back rows folded flat into the floor to maximise cargo volume.

Ford introduced the Territory alongside the existing Falcon wagon, which was built on the same Broadmeadows Assembly Plant production line. Ford Australia senior executives had expected the Falcon wagon to be discontinued soon after the introduction of the Territory, surmising that Falcon wagon sales would substantially decline as fleet buyers migrated to the Territory. However, this did not happen because the Falcon wagon retained much of its fleet sales base and the Territory appealed mainly to large families. The production of the Falcon station wagon was terminated in September 2010. The 
Territory was never a serious replacement for it due to higher fuel consumption and increased weight.

== Ford R7 concept ==
The Ford R7 was a concept SUV which was developed by Ford Australia under the auspices of the late Geoff Polites and was revealed at the 2002 Australian International Motor Show held in Melbourne. So great was the reception of the R7, that Ford fast tracked the development of the R7 into a full blown production model just two years later as the Ford Territory and it previewed the new front styling of the donor Ford Falcon (BA) range.
== Model range ==

Between 2004 and 2016, the Territory had been manufactured adopting the same chassis and sold in a total of five series (SX, SY, SYII, SZ, and final SZ II). The launch of the FG series Falcon, however, resulted in the Territory undergoing a major redesign inside and out, and unlike the donor sedan, receiving a turbodiesel powerplant, citing high fuel consumption of the six cylinder engines due to the high kerb weight.

SX:
The first series, known as the &quot;SX&quot;, was produced between April 2004 and September 2005.

Appearance-wise, the Territory adopted styling cues from the North American Freestyle/Taurus X, which proved to be a defining factor for the support of Ford executives at the head office in Dearborn, Michigan. Simon Butterworth, who was behind the major restyling of the Falcon that resulted in the 2002 BA series, styled the Territory. Marcus Hotblack worked on the Territory&#x27;s interior, inspired by a knife. As a result, the Territory had such convenient features as flexing cup holders and a handbag holder to the side of the seat for female drivers.

The SX Territory was the first Australian-built vehicle to be fitted with an electronic stability control system. In addition, Territory was the first SUV to have won the Australian &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year award, in 2004.

Its platform was available in RWD or AWD, solely powered by the , 4.0-litre DOHC straight-six Barra petrol engine from the BA Falcon albeit slightly detuned via software, paired to a four-speed automatic gearbox. All models were renowned for very high fuel consumption, averaging between .

;Model range
At launch, the SX range of models (and Australian retail prices) were:
* TX: base package (RWD: ; AWD: );
* TS: family safety package (RWD: ; AWD: );
* Ghia: luxury package (RWD: ; AWD: );.

An Alpine DVD entertainment system for rear passengers, with 10.2-inch screen and infrared headphones, was offered as standard or optional depending on the model variant.

Australian and New Zealand SX series models were slightly different visually: all models sold in New Zealand had body-colour bumpers and alloy wheels, including the base model. Front light detail resembles that of women&#x27;s jewellery in a black box. In New Zealand, the only RWD model was the base version and all other models had AWD; while in Australia, all models were available with both traction setups.

The colour range included: Indiana, Envi, Mandarine, Offshore, Silhouette, Winter White and Zesty.

SY:
The SY, primarily a mechanical upgrade with no significant visual differentiation, was introduced in October 2005. Its key features included increased engine power 190 kW, new automatic transmission for AWD models, and as a first for an Australian-built vehicle, a reverse parking camera (optional on the TS and standard on Ghia). The TS now featured standard reverse sensors. All models received a new key design, and on cars built after May 2006, the plastic rear cladding along the bottom edge of the rear tailgate changed to be pressed into the sheet metal.

Again, this Territory was solely powered by a revised 4.0-litre DOHC straight-six engine now producing and . The previous DSI four-speed automatic transmission was retained with minor updates for RWD models; AWD models now featured the six-speed ZF 6HP 26 automatic transmission that contributed to slightly improved fuel consumption.

The 2006 Territory Turbo was AWD-only and its turbocharged version of the base model produced and . Being AWD, it was only available with the then-new six-speed ZF automatic transmission.

;Model range
The range remained unchanged except for the introduction, in mid-2006, of a Territory Turbo available in standard trim or luxury Ghia. It was powered by a turbocharged 4.0-litre DOHC straight-six version of the Barra engine that, due to costs considerations and the Australian market preference for performance variants, took priority over the introduction of a mooted diesel variant to curtail the high 6 cylinder fuel consumption.

At launch, the original SY range of models (and Australian retail prices) were:
* TX (RWD: ; AWD: );
* TS (RWD: ; AWD: );
* Ghia (RWD: ; AWD: ).

At its subsequent launch, the AWD-only standard Turbo and Ghia models instead cost and , respectively.

The first Territory TX-based limited editions emerged:
* SR – released in February 2006, and re-released in June 2008
* SR2 – released in October 2008

The initial colour range was: Winter White, Wired, Lightning Strike, Silhouette, Mercury Silver, Kashmir, Dejavu, Icon and Indiana. It subsequently included: Steel, Grace, Flare, Conquer, Silk, Ego, Seduce, Neo, Velvet and Sensations.

FPV F6X:

On 29 February 2008, Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) launched the &quot;F6X&quot;, which was the first and only non-Falcon vehicle sold by this Ford subsidiary.

Effectively a high-performance version of the Territory Turbo, it was only available in AWD and with a six-speed automatic transmission. It was badged &quot;F6X 270&quot; due to its engine output of and , shared with the similarly engined and Falcon-based FPV F6 sedan. This resulted in this SUV being the most powerful SUV available at the time, with a fast acceleration time of 5.9 seconds.

FPV foreshadowed its intention to enter the SUV scene with the &quot;P-SUV&quot; concept car displayed at its Open Day in February 2007. This vehicle featured a pick-up body style and aggressive off-road styling. The final F6X concept was otherwise displayed at the October 2007 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney.

Aside from its high-performance engine, its other key features included 18-inch wheels, upgraded front Brembo brakes, and fittings such as seating (optional third row seat) and instrumentation styled to mirror those of the FPV sedans. Despite this, the lack of sufficient external differentiation with the donor Territory Turbo, its high price of and poor fuel consumption translated into a low sales success, with a total of 251 units built. As a consequence, production ceased in February 2009 and it was no longer available with the SY II series launched in June 2009.

The F6X colour range included: Ego, Winter White, Lightning Strike, Nitro, Seduce, Sensations, Silhouette and Velvet. Depending on the exterior paint chosen, each had the option of one of two stripe packages in metallic Azure Blue, Pewter or Silver and matte Black. It also featured datadot paint technology.

SY II:
The SY II series was a facelift revealed at the 2009 Australian International Motor Show held in Melbourne and went on sale that May. It featured a mildly restyled front end and other minor exterior changes, improved interior trim (with the previous upholstery colour schemes replaced by more contemporary ones) and improved suspension design. Powertrains remained unchanged, except for the axing of the &quot;FPV F6X&quot;. The BA/BF Falcon centre console and Interior Command Control (ICC) was again reused for the SY II despite the newer FG Falcon having a completely redesigned console and ICC.

The SY II received a revised front suspension to address a well-documented weakness in the front lower ball joints. Specifically, the original design had the ball joints under constant tension, which resulted in some catastrophic failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering at high speeds) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as . With the new design, the lower ball joints were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.

;Model range
The SY II Territory range and upgrades (plus Australian retail prices at launch) were:
* TX: with body-coloured bumpers and alloy wheels standard (RWD: ; AWD: );
* TS: body-coloured bumpers, new alloy wheels, seven-seater with third-row standard (RWD: ; AWD: ).
* Ghia: external mirrors mounted side indicators, new alloy wheels, privacy glass for the rear passenger and cargo windows (RWD: ; AWD: ).

The Turbo was now available only in the latter luxury specification (for ).

A TS Limited Edition was marketed in December 2009 and October 2010 to stimulate sales by providing Ghia-derived fittings.

At launch, the colour range included: Silhouette, Lightning Strike, Velvet, Harmony, Sensations, Steel, Ego, Seduce, Mystic, Winter White and Kashmir.

Through the addition of a front passenger seatbelt warning chime implemented on cars produced from 11 January 2010, the entire Territory range qualified for a full five-star Australasian New Car Assessment Program crash test score. Models produced prior to this date only had a four-star rating.
SZ (major redesign):
The SZ series Territory was released in April 2011. Ford Australia released official photos of this facelifted edition on 8 February 2011. Its development cost was some .

In line with Ford&#x27;s internationally adopted Kinetic Design, the car features a large lower air intake and thin upper grille. It has an estimated . Titanium models feature LED &quot;position&quot; lights, in lieu of the fog lights fitted on the mid-spec TS. At the rear, the car features horizontal tail lights, replacing the vertical lights on previous editions. On the inside, courtesy of the FG Falcon upgrades, the higher-range Territory models also inherited an eight-inch colour touch screen, which is central to the &quot;SYNC&quot; in-car entertainment and control system. New safety features include a driver&#x27;s knee airbag and updated stability control system, now version 9.0 by Bosch incorporating an anti-roll-over function.

Mechanically, the SZ series introduced for the first time in Ford Australia&#x27;s locally made vehicles, a diesel powerplant (whose cost and development in previous editions was postponed in favour of the turbo petrol variant of 2006). It also introduced an electric power-assist steering system used on the American Ford Mustang, which was also poised for introduction on the Falcon.

The engines range of the SZ series comprised the usual but further upgraded 4.0-litre DOHC straight-six petrol engine only for the RWD Territory, and a turbocharged, direct injection 2.7-litre 60-degree V6 diesel engine marketed as &quot;Duratorq&quot; for the RWD and AWD Territory models. Petrol-engined AWD models are no longer offered. The petrol engine, now compliant with Euro 4 emission standards, generates and . At launch, the diesel engine was a seven-year-old Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17 engine, which debuted in Australia with the Jaguar XF and Land Rover Discovery 3. It reportedly emits up to 25% less compared to the petrol engine.

Across the range, two types of six-speed automatic transmission became default depending on model variants. For petrol-engined RWD—the ZF 6HP26 transmission; for diesel-engined RWD and AWD the ZF-based, 6R80 transmission produced by Ford in the United States is used.

Interior-wise, finally the new Territory gained the centre console and ICC of the FG Falcon. Up until this time the Territory had continued to reused the 2002-2008 BA/BF Falcon interior and ICC.

;Model range
The range remained the same except for the Titanium replacing the Ghia, reflecting a similar changes made to the related Ford Falcon (FG) range.

The SZ range and key features or upgrades (plus Australian retail prices at launch) were as follows:
* TX: 17-inch alloy wheels, iPod/USB integration, Bluetooth phone connectivity and cruise control). Available in RWD petrol (), RWD diesel (), AWD diesel ();
* TS: as above but with 18-inch alloy wheels plus four-way power adjustable driver seat, 8-inch colour touch screen, front fog lights, dual-zone climate control, premium audio system and reversing camera, standard 7-seat capacity. Available in RWD petrol (), RWD diesel (), AWD diesel ();
* Titanium: as above plus different 18-inch alloy wheels, LED &quot;position&quot; lights, external mirrors mounted side indicators, chrome detachable front grille, 6-way power adjustable driver seat with three memory settings, glass for the rear passenger and cargo windows, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, satellite navigation with Traffic Message Channel, Alpine DVD entertainment system for rear passengers with 10.2-inch screen and infrared headphones, leather seat trim (in &quot;Shadow&quot; black or &quot;Cashmere&quot; beige). Available in RWD petrol (), RWD diesel (), AWD diesel ().

The Titanium model has proven to be the most popular variant and the SZ series led Ford Australia to reach a significant manufacturing milestone by building 150,000th Territory (a white TX TDCi RWD model) in 2012.

The Titanium (in AWD 2.7-Litre TDCi specification) was also the only variant for exports to Thailand that resumed in late 2012.

A TX Limited Edition was marketed in August 2012 to stimulate sales by providing TS-derived fittings.

The colour range included: Havana, Vanish, Lightning Strike, Winter White, Edge, Chill, Smoke, Emperor and Silhouette.

SZ II:
After 10 years of production, the SZ II series represented the Territory before Ford Australia&#x27;s full production (which also included the FG X Falcon sedan) ceased in October 2016.

The SZ II began production alongside the FG X Falcon on 20 October 2014 and went on sale in the Australian market in December 2014. Its model range remains unchanged relative to the SZ series but, externally, it features subtle styling revisions consisting of a new fascia and alloy wheels, with the Territory losing out its LED &quot;position lights&quot; in favour of more traditional foglights. Mechanically, the engine range also remains unchanged apart from transmission tweaks and aerodynamic improvements that deliver around 0.5% better fuel consumption. Inside, new trims colours feature along with an updated &quot;SYNC2&quot; touchscreen in-car entertainment and control system with voice command, Wi-Fi connectivity, DAB+ radio, and emergency call functionality.

==Exports==

===New Zealand===
The Territory was sold in New Zealand, with 12,000 units sold there.

===South Africa===
Exports to South Africa were made in 2005. Sales of the Territory began on June 22, 2005. The TX and Ghia AWD/RWD models were sold there. Prior to its debut, a Territory was sent to South Africa in 2004 for assessment by Ford&#x27;s South African branch.

Around 2,300 units were exported.

===Thailand===
Exports of the Territory to Thailand was announced to go on sale in April 2006 with the Ghia 4WD model. Prior to that, the SY Territory appeared at the 2005 Bangkok Motor Show. A Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement was also in place at the time the exports started after 2005.

Around 100 units were sold to Thailand in August 2012 after Ford Australia showed interest in a diesel-powered version at the 2012 Bangkok Motor Show held in March 2012.

Concerns were raised that the Thai export program Ford Australia participated in could collapse due to high taxes imposed on imported vehicles. This was pointed out in 2013 after taxes were raised that it was expensive to purchase a Territory.

<text>Brown is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southeast part of the Moon, to the southwest of the prominent ray crater Tycho. Northwest of Brown is the crater Wilhelm, and to the west is Montanari. This crater was named after Ernest William Brown, and is distinct from crater D. Brown, a satellite crater of the Apollo crater.

The rim of Brown is mis-shapen from a typical circular formation, most notably due to the intrusion of the satellite crater Brown E into the southeast of the formation. The northern rim is polygonal in shape, with a flattened northern rim. There is also a small gap in the western rim which protrudes to the west.

==Satellite craters==
There are eight satellite craters of Brown that are recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The official designation of these features was approved in 2006.

<doc id="1100416" wikidata="Q997709" url="?curid=1100416" title="Buch (crater)">
<text>Buch is an old, worn crater that is located in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after German geologist Leopold von Buch. It lies to the northeast of the large crater Maurolycus, and the comparably sized crater Büsching is attached to the northeast rim.

The crater rim is slightly elongated in the northeastern direction, and forms an egg-shaped depression in the surface. The rim has been eroded by many lesser impacts so that the edge is rounded and worn down, and the crater forms only a low depression in the ground. Within the crater the floor is relatively flat and featureless, with no central peak at the midpoint. There is only a small craterlet near the northwest rim.

It has been noted (by Shoemaker and others) that the satellite crater Buch B is unusual in that it possesses both a dark halo of material around the rim and appears to have formed some dark rays. Early speculation was that this may be volcanic in nature, but it was later demonstrated to be a typical impact crater that was formed over a pocket of darker material.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Buch.

<doc id="1100422" wikidata="Q389273" url="?curid=1100422" title="Strong pseudoprime">
<text>A strong pseudoprime is a composite number that passes the Miller–Rabin primality test.
All prime numbers pass this test, but a small fraction of composites also pass, making them &quot;pseudoprimes&quot;.

Unlike the Fermat pseudoprimes, for which there exist numbers that are pseudoprimes to all coprime bases (the Carmichael numbers), there are no composites that are strong pseudoprimes to all bases.

==Motivation and first examples==
Let us say we want to investigate if &quot;n&quot; = 31697 is a probable prime (PRP). We pick base &quot;a&quot; = 3 and, inspired by Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, calculate:
: formula_1
This shows 31697 is a Fermat PRP (base 3), so we may suspect it is a prime. We now repeatedly halve the exponent:
: formula_2
: formula_3
: formula_4
The first couple of times do not yield anything interesting (the result was still 1 modulo 31697), but at exponent 3962 we see a result that is neither 1 nor minus 1 (i.e. 31696) modulo 31697. This proves 31697 is in fact composite (it equals 29×1093). Modulo a prime, the residue 1 can have no other square roots than 1 and minus 1. This shows that 31697 is a strong pseudoprime to base 3.

For another example, pick &quot;n&quot; = 47197 and calculate in the same manner:
: formula_5
: formula_6
: formula_7
In this case, the result continues to be 1 (mod 47197) until we reach an odd exponent. In this situation, we say that 47197 a strong probable prime to base 3. Because it turns out this PRP is in fact composite (can be seen by picking other bases than 3), we have that 47197 is a strong pseudoprime to base 3.

Finally, consider &quot;n&quot; = 74593 where we get:
: formula_8
: formula_9
: formula_10
Here, we reach minus 1 modulo 74593, a situation that is perfectly possible with a prime. When this occurs, we stop the calculation (even though the exponent is not odd yet) and say that 74593 a strong probable prime (and, as it turns out, a strong pseudoprime) to base 3.

==Formal definition==
An odd composite number &quot;n&quot; = &quot;d&quot; · 2&quot;s&quot; + 1 where &quot;d&quot; is odd is called a strong (Fermat) pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot; if:

: formula_11
or
: formula_12

(If a number &quot;n&quot; satisfies one of the above conditions and we don&#x27;t yet know whether it is prime, it is more precise to refer to it as a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;. But if we know that &quot;n&quot; is not prime, then we may use the term strong pseudoprime.)

The definition is trivially met if so these trivial bases are often excluded.

Guy mistakenly gives a definition with only the first condition, which is not satisfied by all primes.

==Properties of strong pseudoprimes==
A strong pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot; is always an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime, an Euler pseudoprime and a Fermat pseudoprime to that base, but not all Euler and Fermat pseudoprimes are strong pseudoprimes. Carmichael numbers may be strong pseudoprimes to some bases—for example, 561 is a strong pseudoprime to base 50—but not to all bases.

A composite number &quot;n&quot; is a strong pseudoprime to at most one quarter of all bases below &quot;n&quot;; thus, there are no &quot;strong Carmichael numbers&quot;, numbers that are strong pseudoprimes to all bases. Thus given a random base, the probability that a number is a strong pseudoprime to that base is less than 1/4, forming the basis of the widely used Miller–Rabin primality test. The true probability of a failure is generally vastly smaller. Paul Erdős and Carl Pomerance showed in 1986 that if a random integer n passes the Miller–Rabin primality test to a random base b, then n is almost surely a prime. For example, of the first 25,000,000,000 positive integers, there are 1,091,987,405 integers that are probable primes to base 2, but only 21,853 of them are pseudoprimes, and even fewer of them are strong pseudoprimes, as the latter is a subset of the former.
However, Arnault

gives a 397-digit Carmichael number that is a strong pseudoprime to every base less than 307.
One way to reduce the chance that such a number is wrongfully declared probably prime is to combine a strong probable prime test with a Lucas probable prime test, as in the Baillie–PSW primality test.

There are infinitely many strong pseudoprimes to any base.

==Examples==
The first strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are
:2047, 3277, 4033, 4681, 8321, 15841, 29341, 42799, 49141, 52633, 65281, 74665, 80581, 85489, 88357, 90751, ... .
The first to base 3 are
:121, 703, 1891, 3281, 8401, 8911, 10585, 12403, 16531, 18721, 19345, 23521, 31621, 44287, 47197, 55969, 63139, 74593, 79003, 82513, 87913, 88573, 97567, ... .
The first to base 5 are
:781, 1541, 5461, 5611, 7813, 13021, 14981, 15751, 24211, 25351, 29539, 38081, 40501, 44801, 53971, 79381, ... .

For base 4, see , and for base 6 to 100, see to .
By testing the above conditions to several bases, one gets somewhat more powerful primality tests than by using one base alone.
For example, there are only 13 numbers less than 25·109 that are strong pseudoprimes to bases 2, 3, and 5 simultaneously.
They are listed in Table 7 of. The smallest such number is 25326001.
This means that, if &quot;n&quot; is less than 25326001 and &quot;n&quot; is a strong probable prime to bases 2, 3, and 5, then &quot;n&quot; is prime.

Carrying this further, 3825123056546413051 is the smallest number that is a strong pseudoprime to the 9 bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.
So, if &quot;n&quot; is less than 3825123056546413051 and &quot;n&quot; is a strong probable prime to these 9 bases, then &quot;n&quot; is prime.

By judicious choice of bases that are not necessarily prime, even better tests can be constructed. For example, there is no composite formula_13 that is a strong pseudoprime to all of the seven bases 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, and 1795265022.

<text>Behaim is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon, just to the south of the crater Ansgarius. To the south of Behaim is the crater Hecataeus, and to the east-southeast is Gibbs.

The inner walls along the rim of Behaim still displays traces of old, worn s. The rim has received a negligible amount of wear from subsequent bombardment, but does not form a circular shape due to an inward bulge along the northern wall. The crater has a notable central peak at the midpoint of the interior floor. A cleft-like feature crosses the southern rim and continues to the south.

Behaim is similar in appearance to Alpetragius crater near the center of the near side, although Behaim is larger.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Behaim.

<doc id="1100425" wikidata="Q597678" url="?curid=1100425" title="Sarcoplasm">
<text>Sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle cell. It is comparable to the cytoplasm of other cells, but it contains unusually large amounts of glycogen (a polymer of glucose), myoglobin, a red-colored protein necessary for binding oxygen molecules that diffuse into muscle fibers, and mitochondria. The calcium ion concentration in sarcoplasm is also a special element of the muscle fiber; it is the means by which muscle contractions take place and are regulated. The sarcoplasm plays a critical role in muscle contraction as an increase in Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasm begins the process of filament sliding. The decrease in Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm subsequently ceases filament sliding. The sarcoplasm also aids in pH and ion balance within muscle cells.

It contains mostly myofibrils (which are composed of sarcomeres), but its contents are otherwise comparable to those of the cytoplasm of other cells. It has a Golgi apparatus near the nucleus, mitochondria just inside the cell membrane (sarcolemma), and a smooth endoplasmic reticulum (specialized for muscle function and called the sarcoplasmic reticulum).

While &quot;sarcoplasm&quot; and &quot;myoplasm,&quot; viewed etymologically, might seem to be synonyms, they are not. Whereas sarcoplasm is a type of cytoplasm, myoplasm is the entire contractile portion of muscle tissue.

While some authors argue that the proteins and other molecules within the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen technically belong to the sarcoplasm. These molecules are not part of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane itself but reside within the enclosed sarcoplasmic reticulum space. In that sense, one could say the sarcoplasmic reticulum has a type of specialized sarcoplasm.

<text>Free-to-play (F2P or FtP) video games are games that give players access to a significant or entire portion of their content without paying or do not require paying to continue playing. Free-to-play is distinct from traditional commercial software, which requires a payment before using the game or service. It is also separate from freeware games, which are entirely costless. Free-to-play&#x27;s model is sometimes derisively referred to as free-to-start due to not being entirely free. Free-to-play games have also been widely criticized as &quot;pay-to-win&quot;—that is, that players can generally pay to obtain competitive or power advantages over other players.
There are several kinds of free-to-play business models. The most common is based on the freemium software model, in which users are granted access to a fully functional game but are incentivised to pay microtransactions to access additional content or more powerful in-game assets. Sometimes the content is entirely blocked without payment; other times it requires immense time &#x27;unlocking&#x27; it for non-paying players, and paying the fee speeds the unlocking process. Another method of generating revenue is to integrate advertisements into the game. And another is to sell cosmetic upgrades such as new outfits: these upgrades do not necessarily help the player win or compete.

The model was first popularly used in early massively multiplayer online games targeted towards casual gamers, before finding wider adoption among games released by major video game publishers to combat video game piracy.

The model has been used by games such as &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends,&quot; &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale,&quot; and the majority of the MOBA games, which offer the &quot;full version&quot; of a product free of charge, while users are charged micropayments to access premium features and virtual goods, often in a piecemeal fashion.

== Game mechanics ==
In-game items can be purely cosmetic, enhance the power of the player, accelerate progression speed, and many more. A common technique used by developers of these games is for the items purchased to have a time limit; after this expires, the item must be repurchased before the user can continue. Another commonly seen mechanic is the use of two in-game currencies: one earned through normal gameplay, and another which can be purchased with real-world money. The second, &quot;premium&quot; currency is sometimes given out in small amounts to non-paying players at certain times, such as when they first start the game, complete a quest, or refer a friend to the game. Many browser games have an &quot;energy bar&quot; that depletes when the player takes actions. These games then sell items such as coffee or snacks to refill the bar.

Free-to-play games are free to install and play, but once the player enters the game, the player is able to purchase content such as items, maps, and expanded customization options. Some games, such as id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake Live&quot;, also use in-game advertising to provide income for free-to-play games. In addition to making in-game items available for purchase, EA integrates in-game advertising into its games. In August 2007, EA completed a deal with Massive Incorporated, which lets Massive update and change in-game advertising in real-time within EA games. Independent game developer Edmund McMillen has claimed that he makes most of his money from sponsors by placing advertisements into the introduction of a game and the game&#x27;s title screen.

== History ==
Matt Mihaly created the first known business model of exchanging virtual items for money in an online game, in 1997 for the flagship title &quot;Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands&quot; for his corporation originally Achaea LLC that later became Iron Realms Entertainment. The free-to-play business model in online games was later realized by Nexon in South Korea to a degree first catching more major media attention at the time. The first Nexon game to use it, &quot;QuizQuiz&quot;, was released in October 1999. Its creator Lee Seungchan would go on to create &quot;MapleStory&quot;.

The free-to-play model originated in the late 1990s and early 2000s, coming from a series of highly successful MMOs targeted towards children and casual gamers, including &quot;Furcadia&quot;, &quot;Neopets&quot;, &quot;RuneScape&quot;, &quot;MapleStory&quot;, and text-based dungeons such as &quot;Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands&quot;. Known for producing innovative titles, small independent developers also continue to release free-to-play games.

Free-to-play games are particularly prevalent in countries such as South Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Microtransaction-based free-to-play mobile games and browser games such as &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Kantai Collection&quot; and &quot;The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls&quot; also have large player populations in Japan. In particular, the &quot;Nikkei Shimbun&quot; reported in September 2012 that &quot;Cinderella Girls&quot; was earning over 1 billion yen in revenue monthly from microtransactions. Electronic Arts first adopted the free-to-play concept in one of its games when it released &quot;FIFA Online&quot; in Korea.

In the late 2000s, many MMOs transitioned to the free-to-play model from subscriptions, including subscription-based games such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar&quot;, &quot;Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures&quot;, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;, and &quot;Champions Online&quot;. This move from a subscription based model to a free-to-play one has proven very beneficial in some cases. &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; is a good example of a game that transitioned from subscription to free-to-play. Turbine as of September 10, 2010, has given an F2P with Cash shop option to &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; which resulted in a tripling of profit. Sony Online Entertainment&#x27;s move to transition &quot;EverQuest&quot; from a subscription model into a hybrid F2P/subscription game was followed by a 125% spike in item sales, a 150% up-tick in unique log-ins, and over three times as many account registrations.

The movement of free-to-play MMOs into the mainstream also coincided with experimentation with other genres as well. The model was picked up by larger developers and more diverse genres, with games such as &quot;Battlefield Heroes&quot;, &quot;Free Realms&quot;, &quot;Quake Live&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; appearing in the late 2000s. The experimentation was not successful in every genre, however. Traditional real time strategy franchises such as &quot;Age of Empires&quot; and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; both attempted free-to-play titles. &quot;Age of Empires Online&quot; was shut down in the midst of a tiny player base and stagnant revenue, and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals 2&quot; was shut down in alpha due to negative reactions from players.

In 2011, revenue from free-to-play games overtook revenue from premium games in the top 100 games in Apple&#x27;s App Store. The percentage of people that spend money on in-game items in these games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, depending on a game&#x27;s quality and mechanics. Even though this means that a large number of people will never spend money in a game, it also means that the people that do spend money could amount to a sizeable number due to the fact that the game was given away for free. Indeed a report from mobile advertising company firm SWRV stated that only 1.5 percent of players opted to pay for in-game items, and that 50 percent of the revenue for such games often came from just ten percent of players. Nevertheless &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that the developers of two such games, Supercell (&quot;Clash of Clans&quot;) and Machine Zone (&quot;Game of War: Fire Age&quot;), were able to afford Super Bowl commercials in 2015 featuring big-name celebrities (respectively Liam Neeson and Kate Upton). The latter, &quot;Game of War&quot;, was in fact, part of a roughly $40 million campaign starring Upton.

As of 2012, free-to-play MOBAs, such as &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2,&quot; &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;, and &quot;Smite&quot; had become among the most popular PC games. The success in the genre has helped convince many video game publishers to copy the free-to-play MOBA model.

During 2015, Slice Intelligence tracked people that bought products in mobile video games, and these players spent an average of $87 in free-to-play games. The highest spending per player in 2015 was in &quot;Game of War: Fire Age&quot;, where the players that bought products on average spent $550.

== Comparison with traditional model ==
The free-to-play model has been described as a shift from the traditional model, also known as premium-priced games, where consumers paid for the cost of the game upfront and the game&#x27;s success was measured by multiplying the number of units of a game sold by the unit price. Within free-to-play, the most important factor is the number of players that a game can keep continuously engaged, followed by how many compelling spending opportunities the game offers its players. With free games that include in-game purchases, two particularly important things occur: first, more people will try out the game since there is zero cost to doing so and second, revenue will likely be more than a traditional game since different players can now spend different amounts of money that depend on their engagement with the game and their preferences towards it. Player populations that spend money on free-to-play games can be broken up into terms that borrow from gambling: &quot;whales&quot; which typically are the smallest segment, up to around 10% of players, but are willing to spend the most on a game; &quot;dolphins&quot; which represent a larger portion of around 40% of players who spend some money but not as much as whales; and &quot;minnows&quot;, representing about half the population, who spend the barest amount to maintain activity. As a result of this distribution, whales typically provide most of the revenue in free to play games, and in some cases, 50% of the revenue comes from 0.15% of players (&quot;white whales&quot;) in one report. It is not unlikely for a very few players to spend tens of thousands of dollars in a game that they enjoy.

For PC gaming specifically, two challenges exist: video game piracy and demanding system requirements. The free-to-play model attempts to solve both these problems by providing a game that requires relatively low system requirements and at no cost, and consequently provides a highly accessible experience funded by advertising and micropayments for extra content or an advantage over other players.

Free-to-play is newer than the pay to play model, and the video game industry is still attempting to determine the best ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, &quot;free-to-play&quot;, has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, &quot;Our hope—and the basket we&#x27;re putting our eggs in—is that &#x27;free&#x27; will soon be disassociated with [sic] &#x27;shallow&#x27; and &#x27;cruddy&#x27;.&quot; However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game&#x27;s publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its &quot;Free Realms&quot; game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony makes money from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a subscription option to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and micropayment items that include character customization options.

In 2020, a study from Germany concluded that some free-to-play games use the &quot;money illusion&quot; as a form to hide the true cost of products. When they examined the game &quot;Fortnite&quot;, they found that since the in-game currency does not have a unique exchange rate, it can conceal the true cost of an in-game purchase, resulting in players potentially paying more than they realize. In 2021 the study was used to take legal action against Epic Games, the publisher of &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

=== Pay-to-win ===
In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items, downloadable content, or to skip cooldown timers may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise hardly be able to access said items. Such games are called &quot;pay-to-win&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;P2W&quot;). In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any advantage over their non-paying peers. Market research indicates that pay-to-win mechanics are considered much more acceptable by players in China than in Western countries, possibly because Chinese players are more habituated to recurring costs associated with gaming, such as gaming café fees.

A common suggestion for avoiding pay-to-win is for payments to only be used to broaden the experience without affecting gameplay. For example, some games, such as &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, and &quot;StarCraft II&quot;, only allow the purchase of cosmetic items, meaning that a player who has spent money on the game will still be on the same level as a player who has not. Others suggest finding a balance where a game encourages players to pay for extra content that enhances the game without making the free version feel limited by comparison. This theory is that players who do not pay for items would still increase awareness of it through word of mouth marketing, which ultimately benefits the game indirectly.

In response to concerns about players using payments to gain an advantage in the game, titles such as &quot;World of Tanks&quot; have explicitly committed to not giving paying players any advantages over their non-paying peers, while allowing the users buying the &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;premium&quot; ammo and expendables without paying the real money. However, features affecting gameplay and win rate, such as purchasing a 100% crew training level, a premium account, premium vehicles, and converting experience points to free experience points, remain available for the paying customers only.

=== Play-to-earn ===

Play-to-earn, also known as pay-to-earn, is a model of monetization that uses cryptocurrency and other blockchain technologies.

=== Nagging ===

In single-player games, another concern is the tendency for free games to constantly request that the player buy extra content, in a similar vein to nagware and trialware&#x27;s frequent demands for the user to &quot;upgrade&quot;. Payment may be required in order to survive or continue in the game, annoying or distracting the player from the experience. Some psychologists, such as Mark D. Griffiths, have criticized the mechanics of freemium games as exploitative, drawing direct parallels to gambling addiction.

=== Purchases by children ===
The ubiquitous and often intrusive use of microtransactions in free-to-play games has sometimes caused children to either inadvertently or deliberately pay for large amounts of virtual items, often for drastically high amounts of real money. In February 2013, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that Apple had agreed to refund a British family £1700.41 after their son had purchased countless microtransactions whilst playing the F2P game &quot;Zombies vs. Ninjas&quot;.

== Outlook ==
Pointing to the disruptive effect of free-to-play on current models, IGN editor Charles Onyett stated in 2011 that &quot;expensive, one-time purchases are facing extinction&quot;. He believes that the current method of paying a one-time fee for most games will eventually disappear completely. Greg Zeschuk of BioWare believes there is a good possibility that free-to-play would become the dominant pricing plan for games, but that it was very unlikely that it would ever completely replace subscription-based games. Developers such as Electronic Arts have pointed to the success of freemium, saying that microtransactions will inevitably be part of every game. While noting the success of some developers with the model, companies such as Nintendo have remained skeptical of free-to-play, preferring to stick to more traditional models of game development and sales. In February 2015 Apple began featuring popular non-freemium software on the App Store as &quot;Pay Once &amp; Play&quot;, describing them as &quot;Great Games with No In-App Purchases ... hours of uninterrupted fun with complete experiences&quot;.

<doc id="1100431" wikidata="Q6565967" url="?curid=1100431" title="List of Canadian plays">
<text>Canadian plays have been written since the 19th century, both in English and in French. The present list comprises plays in English, some of which being translations from French Canadian plays. Full length and one act plays are included but not musicals.

The Playwrights Guild of Canada has a large list of titles of copyrighted plays, included in the present one, mostly their own publications or those of Playwrights Canada Press. The year of the playbook in the present list corresponds to the printed form, but when this information is unavailable, it corresponds to the first stage production. In rare cases, neither is available.

In addition to traditional forms, Canada has a vibrant non-traditional theatre scene with notable experimental, fringe, and other alternative forms, the largest fringe festival in North America being the Edmonton International Fringe Festival.

<text>Ngô Quang Trưởng (13 December 1929 — 22 January 2007) was an officer in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Trưởng gained his commission in the Vietnamese National Army in 1954 and moved up the ranks over the next decade, mostly in the Airborne Brigade. In 1966, Trưởng commanded a division for the first time after he was given command of the 1st Division after helping to quell the Buddhist Uprising. He rebuilt the unit after this divisive period and used it to reclaim the city of Huế after weeks of bitter street fighting during the Tết Offensive. 

In 1972, he was made the commander of I Corps after incompetent leadership by General Hoàng Xuân Lãm resulted in a South Vietnamese collapse in the face of the Easter Offensive, a massive conventional invasion by North Vietnam. He stabilized the ARVN forces before turning back the communists.

In 1975, the communists attacked again. This time, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu gave contradictory orders to Trưởng as to whether he should stand and fight or give up some territory and consolidate. This led to the demoralization of I Corps and its collapse, allowing the communists to gather momentum and overrun South Vietnam within two months. Trưởng fled South Vietnam during the fall of Saigon and settled in Virginia in the United States.

==Early years and military beginnings==
Trưởng was born in 1929 to a wealthy family in the Mekong Delta province of Kiến Hòa (now Bến Tre Province). At the time, Vietnam was part of French Indochina. After graduating from Mỹ Tho College, a French colonial-run school in the Mekong Delta provincial town of Mỹ Tho, Trưởng attended the reserve officer school at Thủ Đức in Saigon, and was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Vietnamese National Army in 1954. Upon graduation from Thủ Đức, Trưởng went immediately on to airborne school at the Command and Staff School of the Vietnamese National Military Academy at Đà Lạt. He served in the elite airborne brigade the next 12 years. His first posting was as commander of 1st Company, 5th Airborne Battalion.
After graduating from Đà Lạt, he soon saw action in a 1955 operation to eliminate the Bình Xuyên river pirates who were vying with President Diệm&#x27;s government for control of Saigon and the surrounding area. In recognition of his performance against the Bình Xuyên, Trưởng was promoted to first lieutenant. When the Republic of Vietnam was created in 1955, the VNA became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).

==Rising through the ranks==
In 1964, Trưởng was promoted to major and made commander of the 5th Airborne Battalion. He led a heliborne assault into Đỗ Xá Secret Zone in Minh Long District, Quảng Ngãi Province, in central Vietnam. This attack destroyed the base area of the Việt Cộng&#x27;s (VC) B-1 Front Headquarters. In 1965, Trưởng led the 5th Airborne Battalion on a helicopter assault into the Hát Dịch Secret Zone in the vicinity of the Ong Trinh Mountain in Phước Tuy Province southeast of Saigon, the base area of the VC 7th Division. In two days of fighting, Trưởng&#x27;s 5th Battalion inflicted heavy casualties on two VC regiments, and he was awarded a battlefield promotion to lieutenant colonel and the National Defense Medal, Fourth Class. After the battle, Trưởng became chief of staff of the Airborne Brigade and then became chief of staff of the division later in the year. His reputation for valour and fairness gained the attention of the senior generals in Saigon. General Cao Văn Viên, chief of the Joint General Staff from 1965 to 1975, later described Trưởng as &quot;one of the best commanders at every echelon the Airborne Division ever had.&quot;

In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising broke out in central Vietnam with Buddhists protested military control of the government. Trưởng was asked to quell the rebellious 1st Division in Huế, which had decided to stop military operations against the VC in solidarity with the Buddhist protest movement. A Buddhist, Trưởng, was uncomfortable with his mission, but he carried out his orders. On 18 June, he commanded three airborne battalions that entered the city and restored order within two days and he put the 1st Division under government control.

==General==
As a result of his efficient display, Saigon made Trưởng&#x27;s appointment as 1st Division commander permanent. With his hands-on leadership, Trưởng quickly moulded the unit, which had a poor reputation prior to his arrival, and had been heavily weakened by the infighting of the past year, into one of the best units in the ARVN. Trưởng handpicked his leading subordinate officers and put his battalions in the hands of majors who had many years of combat experience. Unlike most, he eschewed politics in choosing his officers, and implemented new training programs to improve the capability of his troops and Regional (RF) and Popular Forces (PF) that augmented them. Trưởng&#x27;s dedication to his unit and leadership significantly raised the morale of his subordinates. As part of his strategy of better integrating the territorial forces with the regular army, Trưởng had his battalion commanders act as district chiefs, who normally worked only with the territorial forces. As a result, the regulars began to coordinate their pacification campaigns more effectively with the paramilitary forces. In 1967, Trưởng&#x27;s 1st Division assaulted and dismantled the VC infrastructure and a large part of their fighters from the Luong Co-Dong Xuyen-My Xa Front in Hương Trà District in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. Trưởng was rewarded with a promotion to brigadier general.

During the Tết Offensive, Trưởng led the 1st Division in the Battle of Huế as the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and VC were expelled from the old imperial city after three weeks of bitter street fighting. Following the famous victory in the citadel, Trưởng was given a second star and made a major general. In August 1970, he was assigned to command IV Corps, which oversaw the Mekong Delta region. He was based at the Corps&#x27; headquarters in Cần Thơ. General Creighton Abrams, the head of American forces in Vietnam, recommended Trưởng to President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, saying, &quot;I can recommend, without any reservations at all ... Trưởng. I think he&#x27;s proved over and over and in all facets — pacification, military operations, whatever it is&quot;. He was promoted to lieutenant general in June 1971.

==Corps commander==
During his tenure in the Mekong Delta, Trưởng established a system of outposts along the border with Cambodia to block infiltration of PAVN/VC personnel and supplies into the region. He used the three divisions in his Corps in regimental-sized combined arms task forces and staged sweeps to seek and destroy PAVN/VC forces in their strongholds. He increased the capability of the RF/PF, which had a reputation for unreliability in his area, making them a productive part of his anti-PAVN/VC apparatus. Trưởng later said that these forces &quot;shed their paramilitary origins and increasingly became full-fledged soldiers&quot;. It was estimated that although they provided 50% of the manpower, the RF and PF cost only 5% of total military costs. During his period in charge of IV Corps, the region&#x27;s regular forces were depleted because a proportion of them were across the border as part of the Cambodian Campaign, seeking to destroy PAVN/VC jungle bases, supplies and staging grounds for an invasion into South Vietnam.

Trưởng used the RF/PF that he had enhanced to fill the void, and they strengthened the government control in the region despite having nominally less resources. In the forests surrounding U Minh, Trưởng&#x27;s outpost building programs resulted in a record number of defectors as the populace became more confident in his forces&#x27; ability to provide security. When American Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker came to inspect an outlying military base that Trưởng had built, he asked if the general intended to stay there. Trưởng replied &quot;Yes, forever&quot;. Trưởng was so successful in pacifying the Mekong Delta that he allowed some of his forces to be redeployed to other parts of South Vietnam.

Known for his unbending integrity, Trưởng vigorously moved against &quot;ghost&quot; and &quot;ornamental&quot; soldiers, deserters and conscription evaders in his region. Abrams said that only Trưởng and Phạm Văn Phú among the division and corps commanders had not begun to psychologically crack under the pressure of the PAVN onslaught.

During the PAVN&#x27;s Easter Offensive) of 1972, in early May he was given command of I Corps, replacing the disgraced Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm. General Trưởng held PAVN forces at bay before Huế and then launched (against the initial resistance of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and MACV) Operation Lam Son 72. During the counteroffensive, he successfully pushed PAVN forces back to the city of Quang Tri (which was retaken in September) and advanced on to the Cửa Việt river.

==Collapse of South Vietnam==

Trưởng remained in command of I Corps until the collapse of South Vietnam, when the north of the country lapsed into anarchy amid confused leadership by President Thiệu. I Corps fielded three infantry divisions, the elite Airborne and Marine Divisions, four Ranger Groups and an armored brigade. Until mid-March, due to Trưởng&#x27;s highly effective leadership, the PAVN had only tried to cut the highways, despite having five divisions and 27 further regiments far outnumbering Trưởng&#x27;s men. At a meeting on 13 March, Trưởng and the new III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Toàn briefed Thiệu. By this time, South Vietnam was suffering from severe cutbacks in US aid, and the loss of Ban Mê Thuột in the central highlands, which threatened to split the country in two and isolate Trưởng&#x27;s I Corps from the rest of the country. Thiệu laid out his plan to consolidate a smaller proportion of territory so that the forces could more effectively defend the area. As Trưởng understood it, he was free to redeploy his forces south to hold Đà Nẵng, South Vietnam&#x27;s second largest city, thereby abandoning Huế. Fearful of and preoccupied with stopping a coup, Thiệu also decided to remove the Airborne and Marines to Saigon, leaving I Corps exposed.

Thiệu called Trưởng to Saigon on 19 March to brief him on the withdrawal plan. Trưởng intended to order a retreat to Huế, Đà Nẵng and Chu Lai, and then move all the forces to Đà Nẵng to regroup and dig in. Thiệu then stunned Trưởng by announcing that he had misinterpreted his previous orders: Huế was not to be abandoned, despite losing two divisions in recent days. In the meantime, the withdrawal preparations and the increasing North Vietnamese pressure caused civilians to flee in fear, clogging the highway and hampering the withdrawal. Trưởng requested permission to withdraw his forces into the three enclaves as planned; Thiệu ordered him to &quot;hold onto any territory he could with whatever forces he now had, including the Marine Division&quot;, implying that he could retreat if needed. Trưởng returned to Đà Nẵng to be greeted by the start of a PAVN offensive. President Thiệu made a nationwide radio broadcast that afternoon proclaiming that Huế would be held &quot;at all costs&quot;, contradicting the previous order. That evening Trưởng ordered a retreat to a new defense line at the Mỹ Chánh River to defend Huế, thereby ceding all of Quảng Trị Province. He was confident that his forces could hold Huế, but was then astounded by a late afternoon message from Thiệu that ordered &quot;that because of inability to simultaneously defend all three enclaves, the I Corps commander was free ... to redeploy his forces for the defense of Đà Nẵng only.&quot; The people of Quảng Trị and Huế began to leave their homes by the hundreds of thousands, joining an ever-growing exodus toward Đà Nẵng.

Meanwhile, the PAVN closed in on Đà Nẵng amid the chaos caused by Thiệu&#x27;s confused leadership. Within a few days I Corps was beyond control. The South Vietnamese tried to evacuate from the other urban enclaves into Đà Nẵng, but the 1st Division collapsed after its commander, Brigadier General Nguyễn Văn Điềm, angered by Thiệu&#x27;s abandonment, told his men, &quot;We&#x27;ve been betrayed ... It is now &quot;sauve qui peut&quot; (every man for himself) ... [S]ee you in Đà Nẵng.&quot; The overland march, pummeled by PAVN artillery the entire way, degenerated into chaos as the 1st Division descended into anarchy as it moved toward Đà Nẵng. The remainder of the force deserted or began looting. Only a minority survived and some disillusioned officers committed suicide.

As anarchy and looting enveloped Đà Nẵng, and a defense of the city becoming impossible, Trưởng requested permission to evacuate by sea, but Thiệu, baffled, refused to make a decision. When his communications with Saigon were sundered by PAVN shelling, Trưởng ordered a naval withdrawal, as Thiệu was not making a decision either way.

With no support or leadership from Thiệu, the evacuation turned into a costly debacle, as the PAVN pounded the city with artillery, killing thousands of people. Many drowned while jostling for room on the boats; with no logistical support from Saigon, those vessels sent were far too few for the millions of would-be evacuees. Only around 16,000 soldiers were pulled out, and of the almost two million civilians that packed Đà Nẵng, a little more than 50,000 were evacuated. As a result, 70,000 troops were taken prisoner, along with around 100 aircraft. Trưởng and his officers swam to a boat in the sea and evacuated to Saigon. In quick succession the remaining cities along the coastline collapsed and half the country had fallen in two weeks.

Upon arriving in Saigon, Trưởng was appointed deputy chairman of the Joint General Staff and given responsibility for organizing the defense of Saigon, however he found the area was too large and difficult to be defended with the forces available.

Trưởng was reportedly hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. An American officer who had worked closely with him heard of Trưởng&#x27;s plight, and arranged for his family to leave on an American ship amid the chaos of the fall of Saigon and the PAVN takeover of South Vietnam. Truong fled Vietnam with former Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ by helicopter on the morning of 30 April 1975, the day of the fall of Saigon.

==Life in the United States==
Trưởng&#x27;s family was initially broken up amid the confusion. His wife and eldest son ended up in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, while his two daughters and second son fled Saigon with a US State Department employee to Seattle. Trưởng&#x27;s youngest son, aged four, ended up at Camp Pendleton, California; the toddler did not speak English and was not identified for a few weeks. After his family was fully accounted for, Trưởng relocated with them to Falls Church, Virginia.

In 1983, he became an American citizen and moved to Springfield, Virginia. He studied computer programming at Northern Virginia Community College and worked as a computer analyst for the Association of American Railroads for a decade until he retired in 1994.

Trưởng wrote several military history works commissioned by the United States Army Center of Military History, as part of its &quot;Indochina Monographs&quot; series. These were &quot;The Easter Offensive of 1972&quot; (1979), &quot;RVNAF and US Operational Cooperation and Coordination&quot; (1980) and &quot;Territorial Forces&quot; (1981).

==Death==
Trưởng died of cancer on 22 January 2007, at the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia. At the time of his death, Trưởng was survived by his wife, three sons, two daughters, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. After his death, the Virginia House of Representatives and Senate passed a joint resolution &quot;Celebrating the Life of Ngo Quang Truong&quot;.

==Assessment==
Trưởng was widely regarded as South Vietnam&#x27;s finest officer, and the US officers that worked with him generally rated him to be superior to most American commanders. He was also renowned for his integrity and his uninvolvement in corruption, favoritism or political cronyism, as well as his empathy and solidarity with his soldiers. William Westmoreland, the US commander in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968, said that Trưởng &quot;would rate high on any list of capable South Vietnamese leaders ... [other U.S. commanders] so admired Trưởng that they would trust him to command an American division.&quot; His successor Creighton Abrams, who oversaw the American war effort until 1972, said that Trưởng &quot;was capable of commanding an American division&quot;.

Lieutenant General Robert E. Cushman Jr., and his main subordinate, Lieutenant General Richard G. Stilwell, who operated alongside Trưởng in I Corps in the 1960s said that because of Trưởng&#x27;s efforts, the ARVN 1st Division was &quot;equal to any American unit&quot;. General Bruce Palmer Jr. said that Trưởng was &quot;probably the best field commander in South Vietnam.&quot; In 1966, Trưởng&#x27;s American adviser wrote to General Harold K. Johnson, describing the Vietnamese officer as &quot;dedicated, humble, imaginative and tactically sound.&quot;

General Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded US forces during the Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, served as Trưởng&#x27;s adviser in the 1960s when he was deployed to South Vietnam as a major during a campaign at Ia Drang. He wrote in his autobiography &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Take A Hero&quot;, that Trưởng &quot;did not look like my idea of a military genius: only five feet seven ... very skinny, with hunched shoulders and a head that seemed too big for his body ... His face was pinched and intense ... and there was always a cigarette hanging from his lips. Yet he was revered by his officers and troops—and feared by those North Vietnamese commanders who knew of his ability.&quot; Schwarzkopf said that Trưởng was &quot;the most brilliant tactical commander I&#x27;d ever known&quot; and that &quot;by visualizing the terrain and drawing on his experience fighting the enemy for fifteen years, Truong showed an uncanny ability to predict what they were going to do&quot;.

Lieutenant Colonel James H. Willbanks, who served in Vietnam and was a professor of military history at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, said of Trưởng:

Unlike some South Vietnamese generals who had grown rich as they ascended the ranks, Trưởng was regarded as being completely incorruptible and lived a &quot;spartan and ascetic&quot; life. According to Lieutenant General Cushman, Trưởng did not own a suit, and by the time he was appointed to command IV Corps, his wife tended to pigs, which were kept behind his basic living quarters in the headquarters at Cần Thơ. Cushman added that Trưởng was always looking for means to raise his soldiers&#x27; material and family lives. Trưởng did not tolerate favoritism. He once received a request to transfer his nephew from the front line to a desk job; he refused and the nephew later was killed in action. General Bruce Palmer Jr., said Trưởng &quot;deserved a better fate&quot; than the mauling of his soldiers amid Thiệu&#x27;s confused orders and the collapse of South Vietnam.

<doc id="1100450" wikidata="Q234300" url="?curid=1100450" title="Medinan surah">
<text>A Medinan surah () of the Quran is one that was revealed at Medina after Muhammad&#x27;s hijrah from Mecca. They are the latest 28 Suwar. The community was larger and more developed, in contrast to its minority position in Mecca.

The Medinan Surahs occur mostly at the beginning and in the middle of the Qur&#x27;an (but are said to be the last revealed surahs chronologically), and typically have more and longer ayat (verses). Due to the new circumstances of the early Muslim community in Medina, these surahs more often deal with details of moral principles, legislation, warfare (as in Surah 2, al-Baqara), and principles for constituting the community. They also refer more often to the community with &quot;O people!&quot; and at times directly address Muhammad or speak of him as &quot;an agent acting in combination with the divine persona: &#x27;God and his messenger&#x27; (Q 33:22)&quot;.

The division of surahs into &#x27;Meccan surahs&#x27; and &#x27;Medinan surahs&#x27; is primarily a consequence of stylistic and thematic considerations, which Theodor Noldeke used to develop his famous chronology of the Qur&#x27;anic suras. Classification of the surahs into these periods is based upon factors such as the length of the verse and the presence or absence of certain key concepts or word (e.g. &quot;al-Rahman&quot; as name of God).

==Characteristics of Medinan surahs==

Following are some of the stylistic and subject characteristics of Medinan Surahs:
* Mention of &#x27;Jihad&#x27; and detailing on its rulings.
* Details of Islamic jurisprudence and legal system as well as laws governing family, money transaction, international law and acts of worship.
* Mention of &#x27;Munafiq&#x27; and dealing with hypocrites.
* Any verse that starts with يا أيها للذين آمنوا &quot;O you who believe.&quot;
* Long verses.
* Easier vocabulary.
* Discussion in regards to the People of the Book.

== The Medinan phase ==
The Medinan phase lasted approximately 10 years. The phase began from Muhammad&#x27;s hijrah to Madina; and ended with the death of Muhammad. While the themes of the Meccan surahs remain, the Muslims growing into more of a community and the formation of Ummah, now is clear.

== Chronological order of Medinan surahs ==
The order of the 28 surahs, is as follows:

<doc id="1100460" wikidata="Q2339715" url="?curid=1100460" title="Közi">
<text>Közi (born May 29, 1972) is a Japanese musician, singer-songwriter and DJ. He is best known as one of the guitarists for the 1990s visual kei rock band Malice Mizer. After they went on indefinite hiatus in 2001, he formed the industrial rock duo Eve of Destiny and also started a solo career. Közi is currently in the bands XA-VAT, ZIZ and Vamquet, while occasionally performing solo shows.

During his time in Malice Mizer, Közi often assumed the role of a pierrot doll, dressing in clown-like costumes with large ruffs, always in shades of red, his favorite color. In music videos and on-stage he would often make movements reminiscent of a marionette. Közi has continued this visual style to some extent, but his contemporary stage costumes are more gothic. His work on the &quot;Izayoi no Tsuki&quot; project was reminiscent of carnival music, and artwork for his projects usually follow a dramatic, theatrical theme. Very few details about his private life are known.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Közi first learned to play bass guitar because everyone else had wanted to play guitar. But after seeing guitarist Seiji Watanabe play songs by Los Angeles heavy metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Ratt, he began dabbling in guitar and wanted to form his own band. He performed bass, and occasionally vocals due to revolving lineups, in many cover bands around his hometown in Niigata. He started playing guitar when he moved to Tokyo at eighteen years of age.

===Career===
Közi&#x27;s career began in 1989 at 17 years old in the underground band Beyond the Rein Sight, and, later, as a member of Girl. Information about both of these bands, however, is very scarce. In late 1991, he joined with Mana and released two demo tapes. Közi and Mana left Matenrou after deciding they both had similar ideas about creating music, they formed Malice Mizer in 1992. After Malice Mizer disbanded in 2001, Közi joined Haruhiko Ash (from The Zolge) and created Eve of Destiny, an industrial rock band that toured outside Japan several times.

In 2002, Közi collaborated with Japanese author Minako, to provide the soundtrack to her book, &quot;Izayoi no Tsuki&quot;. He then performed a special singing event, which cemented the fact that he was following a solo career. Közi&#x27;s first solo release was the two-disc, double-single package, &quot;Khaos/Kinema&quot;, released on November 1, 2003. On March 11, 2004, he released his debut album, &quot;Catharsis&quot;. Közi&#x27;s second single, &quot;Memento&quot;, was released on December 1, 2004. The song is dedicated to deceased Malice Mizer drummer Kami and was written by Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki. On May 17, 2006, Közi released his second album, &quot;Loki N&#x27; Roll&quot;.

Former Deadman frontman Mako released a photo book called &quot;Buried Alive by Words&quot; on May 29, 2008, which came with a CD of a song called &quot;Buried with the Light&quot; that features Közi on guitar and bass. On September 22, 2008, Közi joined the punk rock band Dalle, which consisted of Satoshi on vocals, Atsushi Hatta (Deep) on bass, Fuchi on drums and of course Közi on guitar. The band played its first live on October 18 at Shinjuku Marz during the Tokyo Dark Castle ~ Halloween Special event, which also featured Auto-Mod and Aural Vampire. However, due to a five year hiatus and member changes, they did not have their first release until 2015. As of 2017, the group consisted of Közi, Atsushi, vocalist Ryo (Hollowgram) and Rieu on keyboards. Following numerous singles, Dalle released their first album, &quot;Ambivalence to Violenta&quot;, at the end of 2017. Közi left Dalle after a concert on June 4, 2022.
On December 27, 2008, Közi played on stage with, his former Malice Mizer bandmate Mana&#x27;s solo project, Moi dix Mois for a session gig at their Dis Inferno Vol.VI ~Last Year Party~ event. In 2009 he went on a short coupling tour with Moi dix Mois called Deep Sanctuary, on July 17 in Osaka and the 19th in Tokyo. A year later in July 2010, Közi went on another tour with Moi dix Mois, titled Deep Sanctuary II. This tour had six shows, but the gig at Akasaka Blitz on the 17th was special, as Malice Mizer bassist Yu~ki, was a special guest. This was the first time in nine years that the three remaining original members played together. The trio have performed together at the event several times since.

Around June 2010, Közi started to perform with a band called My Horror Revue. He also formed the band , with Shuji Ishii (Cali Gari, Goatbed) on vocals, Takao Koma (Goatbed) on drums, Sadie Pink Galaxy ( on rhythm guitar and Közi on lead guitar. They held their first performance on November 16, 2010 and released their first self-titled single on December 2. They released their debut album &quot;Tsuya°C&quot; on March 26, 2011 in two limited editions, one with a live DVD, the other with a remix CD, and a regular edition. Following a hiatus that began in 2013, XA-VAT resumed activities in 2018 and released the mini-album &quot;K-I-S&quot;.

Közi performed in Paris at Porte de Versailles on April 9 and 10, 2011, with guest Miyu from Royal Cabaret. He planned to go to Moscow with The Candy Spooky Theater and Velvet Eden for a Halloween concert, however, it was moved and took place in Japan. In 2012 he formed the band , composed of his backing band from his solo career; with himself as vocalist and guitarist, bassist Sugiya (Moi dix Mois), guitarist Jiro (Bioactive), keyboardist Yugami (Yugami Hakase) and drummer Chargeeeeee... (Omega Dripp). Their first album, &quot;Gift&quot;, was released on May 29 and a collaborative EP with Ken Morioka followed on December 28. ZIZ released their second album, &quot;Neighboring Chaosmos&quot;, on December 12, 2014.

In 2016, he formed the trio Vamquet with Sadie Pink Galaxy and Kai (Art Marju Duchain). They released their first album on November 23.

<text>Richard Gerald Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 4th Baron Acton, Baron Acton of Bridgnorth (30 July 1941 – 10 October 2010) was a British Labour Party politician and peer.

==Early life and education==
The oldest son of John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton and Daphne Strutt, daughter of Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh, he was educated at St George&#x27;s College in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) and at Trinity College, Oxford, from which he emerged with a Bachelor of Arts in 1963 (later, he would receive a Master of Arts from the same institution).

==Career==
He served a term as director of Coutts &amp; Co before being admitted to Inner Temple in 1976 and practising law for about four years. He then served as a Senior Law Officer of the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe from 1981 until 1985.

He became the 4th Baron Acton, as well as 11th Baronet of Aldenham in 1989, upon his father&#x27;s death. He lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, which he notably supported. However, on 17 April 2000, he was created a life peer as Baron Acton of Bridgnorth, &quot;of Aldenham in the County of Shropshire&quot;, enabling him to return to the House.

Lord Acton sat on the Labour benches and served on the Constitution Committee and on the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.

==Personal life==
From 1965 to 1973, Acton was married to Hilary Cookson, with whom he had a son, Johnny. After having been a widower for a year, he married Judith Todd, the daughter of Sir Garfield Todd, former Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. The marriage ended in 1984.

In 1988, Acton married his third wife, Patricia Nassif, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law in Iowa City, Iowa. He divided his time between London and Cedar Rapids in Iowa. The couple remained married until his death.

Lord Acton was succeeded by his son from his first marriage and only child John Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 5th Baron Acton.
