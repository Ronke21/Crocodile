<text>The Motorola 6845, or MC6845, is a display controller that was widely used in 8-bit computers during the 1980s. Originally intended for designs based on the Motorola 6800 CPU and given a related part number, it was more widely used alongside various other processors, and was most commonly found in machines based on the Zilog Z80 and MOS 6502.

The 6845 is not an entire display solution on its own; the chip&#x27;s main function is to properly time access to the display memory, and to calculate the memory address of the next portion to be drawn. Other circuitry in the machine then uses the address provided by the 6845 to fetch the pattern and then draw it. The implementation of that hardware is entirely up to the designer and varied widely among machines. The 6845 is intended for character displays, but could also be used for pixel-based graphics, with some clever programming.

Among its better-known uses are the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, and Videx VideoTerm display cards for the Apple II. It is also part of many early graphics adapter cards for the IBM PC, including the MDA, Hercules Graphics Card (HGC), Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and the Plantronics Colorplus. Its functionality was duplicated and extended by custom circuits in the EGA and VGA PC video adapters.

== Design ==
Originally designed by Hitachi as the HD46505, Hitachi-built versions are in a wide variety of Japanese computers, from Sony, Sharp, Panasonic, and Casio. Cloned later as MB89321A by Fujitsu. It is also known as the 6845 CRTC or the CRTC6845, meaning &quot;cathode-ray tube controller&quot;. This version was used on the Apricot PC and Victor 9000 to provide a 800x400 resolution monochrome display.

A common clone of this CRT controller is the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) UM6845E CRT controller. During the time of cold war technology embargoes, the 6845 was cloned in Bulgaria under the designation CM607. The 6845 was very similar and related to the later 6545 manufactured by MOS Technology (Commodore Semiconductor Group) and Rockwell (in two versions).

==Overview==
The chip generates the signals necessary to interface with a raster display but does not generate the actual pixels, though it does contribute cursor and video-blanking information to the pixel video (intensity) signals. It is used to produce correctly timed horizontal and vertical sync and provide the address in memory from which the next pixel or set of pixels should be read. The process of reading that value, converting it into pixels, and sending it to a CRT is left to other circuits. Because of this, systems using the 6845 may have very different numbers and values of colors, or may not support color at all.

Interlaced and non-interlaced output modes are supported, as is a hardware text cursor. The sync generation includes generation of horizontal and vertical video blanking signals, which are used to condition the external pixel generation circuits. Also, an internal latch is provided which when triggered will duplicate and retain a copy of the video address so that it can later be read back by the CPU. This is useful for light pens and light guns which can function by sending a pulse to the 6845 when the electron beam passes, allowing a running program to read back the location that was pointed at. Because of this feature, most computer video adapters using a 6845 included a light pen interface, though it was usually an internal connector on the board itself, not on the outside of the computer, and it was usually undocumented in the user manual.

Because all aspects of video timing are programmable, a single machine can switch between 50Hz and 60Hz timings in software (or indeed any other refresh rates within the limits of the chip). The 6845 can be used to drive monitors or any other raster display.

==Internals==

The chip has a total of registers controlling all aspects of video timings. Only two addresses are exposed to external components - one to select which internal register is to be read or written to and another to access that register.

The 6845 is intended for character based displays. Every address it generates is composed of two parts - a 14 bit character address and a 5 bit row address. The character address increases linearly. When the chip signals horizontal sync it increases the row address. If the row address does not equal the programmatically set number of rows per character, then the character address is reset to the value it had at the beginning of the scan line that was just completed. Otherwise the row address is reset to zero and the memory address continues increasing linearly. This causes the same sequence of character values to be re-read from the memory for each raster line of each character row, before the 6845 advances the memory address to the next character row and repeats the same pattern.

If the character address is used to look up a character reference in RAM and the row address to index a table of character graphics in ROM an ordinary text mode display is constructed. The character reference read from memory must be combined with the row address to form the address for the character graphics ROM, with the character reference selecting a set of scan line patterns that forms one character and the row address indexing into that set to select one scan line. In other words, the ROM address is split into two parts in order to use the ROM as a two-dimensional array: the first dimension selects a character, and the second selects a row of that character&#x27;s graphic pattern.

However, the 6845 left to the designer the freedom to route the bits of the memory and row addresses to video RAM as they saw fit. For this reason the word addressed by the 6845 does not have to equal one pixel or one character. In CGA alphanumeric (text) mode, there are two bytes per character, accessed sequentially by the 6845—the first byte is a character code byte and the second byte is a character attribute byte—and the board uses the contents of the bytes, together with the row address, to read font data from ROM and generate the pixels.

Different routing of the bits, omitting the character ROM, could be used to emulate a frame buffer. Due to its 128 line limitation, the 6845 is not able to provide linear large linear frame buffers. A solution was to combine row address and character address to provide linear scanlines within a non-linear buffer. This has the advantages of easier programming for non-character display and easy smooth horizontal scrolling but can impede smooth vertical scrolling. For example the IBM CGA graphics mode uses a word size of one byte, and each word represents four or eight pixels (in the medium- or high-resolution graphics modes respectively); the 6845 is configured for a 2-pixel character height and the row address bit RA0 is used for bit 13 of the frame buffer address. This way, 200 vertical pixels can be used despite the 128 line limitation. Graphics mode on other systems used a similar trick: in the Hercules Graphics Card, bits 12-13 of the frame buffer address came from row address bits RA0-RA1, providing a vertical resolution of 348 pixels from 87 four-pixel-high &quot;lines&quot;; the Amstrad CPC used a line height of 8 just like in text mode, mapping row address RA0-RA2 to memory address MA11-MA13 and character address CA0-CA10 to memory address MA0-MA10.

These modes of operation were possible because the 6845 did not perform any buffering of character data. In the 1970s, 1980s, and to a lesser extent the 1990s, memory was expensive, fast memory was especially so, and this was an important concern. In the 1970s and early to mid-1980s, chip circuit densities were not very high either, and putting an 80-byte or larger character buffer into a chip like the 6845 might have enlarged the chip die by 50-100%, in turn making it more expensive by a few times that factor due to the exponential growth of chip defect rates and the consequent decline of production yield with die size.

On the other hand, the 6845 put the onus on its users to provide enough memory bandwidth to support rereading data on every line. If a character occupies one &quot;word&quot; in the video buffer, a display of &quot;l&quot; lines and &quot;c&quot; columns of characters with &quot;s&quot; scan lines per character requires &quot;l&quot; × &quot;c&quot; words of memory to represent a full screen of characters but takes &quot;s&quot; times that many memory accesses to complete one refresh cycle: each line of character words is repeatedly read &quot;s&quot; times before the next line is read. This means that character displays using the 6845 require high memory bandwidth on the order of the bandwidth required for all-points-addressable graphics displays of the same resolution.

A different video display controller that buffers one whole line of character data internally can avoid this repeated reading of each line of characters from the display buffer RAM, reducing the required memory bandwidth and allowing either slower, less expensive memory chips to be used, more time for a system CPU to access the memory, or a combination of both. Adding such a character buffer to the 6845 was deemed to not be cost-effective approach when the chip was introduced; however, only a few years later the VIC-II chip used on the Commodore 64 did include such a character line cache.

===Limitations===
Using the full address range RA0-RA4:CA0-CA13 the 6845 can address words of memory. A word may be any number of bits chosen by the system designer as the memory width: though the number of unique addresses that the 6845 can address is limited to , the amount of memory that the 6845 can address may be significantly larger than might be assumed because the 6845 imposes no limit on the size of each memory location that it addresses. If the word size is one byte, as is often the case, the 6845 can address 512 KiB. If the word size is 32 bits, e.g. for 32-bit color graphics with one pixel per word, then the 6845 can address 2048 KiB; for 64-bit words, it can address twice as much. These limits arise from the combination of the 6845 and the design of the external memory connected to it, not from the 6845 alone.

=== Linear framebuffers ===
As described before, the 6845 cannot ordinarily provide large linear framebuffers. One design could only use 14-bit character addressing and set the number of lines per character to 1 but would be restricted to 128 lines and 16 KB of addressable memory.

== Differences from the 6545 ==
Although overwhelmingly compatible, a number of small variations exist between the 6845 and 6545.

The biggest difference is that the 6545 may be configured so that it has sole access to the address bus for video memory. Two additional registers are included for setting any address the CPU wishes to read and the chip alternates between outputting addresses for display generation and the display set for CPU access.

Smaller changes are that the MOS Technology and one variation of the Rockwell 6545 lack interlaced output support and all 6545s include an optional address skew, which delays display enable for one character cycle if set. This second feature was incorporated into later variations of the Motorola 6845. The 6545 may be set to work in linear 14 bit mode using a status bit. On the 6845 the same thing requires adjustment of the character height.

==Tricks==
The 6845 reads the start address for its display once per frame. However, if the internal timing values on the chip are altered at the correct time it can be made to prepare for a new frame without ending the current one - creating a non-continuous break in generated addresses midway through the display. This is commonly used by demos and much more rarely games to provide one moving area of the display (usually the play field) and one static (usually a status display).

Vertical scrolling appears constrained because only the character start address can be set and the row address is always zeroed at frame start, but by adjusting border times it is possible to shift the position the framebuffer is shown on the raster display for increments in between whole characters. With drawing of blank pixels at the screen edges, this can be made invisible to the user creating just the illusion of a smooth vertical scroll.

<text>Huguang was a province of China during the Yuan and Ming dynasties. It was founded by the Yuan dynasty in 1274. During the Yuan dynasty it included the areas of modern Hubei south of the Yangtze river, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. During the Ming dynasty it came to include just the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan, in the process adding areas north of the Yangtze. It was partitioned in 1644 by the newly established Qing dynasty, becoming the provinces of Hubei and Hunan, which were administered by the [[viceroy of Lianghu]] (&quot;The Two Lake Provinces&quot;).

==Governors==
Li Hongzhang was the viceroy of Huguang from 1867 to 1870.

Zhang Zhidong became the viceroy of Huguang in 1896, following the First Sino-Japanese War. He was notable for employing foreigners to train and equip the local military to the standards of a contemporary European army. The most elite of Zhang&#x27;s forces were known as the &quot;Wuchang Division&quot;.

Following its partition, the separate provinces were administered by governors, while Lianghu or Huguang was collectively overseen by a viceroy.

<doc id="1109686" wikidata="Q128403915" url="?curid=1109686" title="Venetian window">
<text>A Venetian window (also known as a Serlian or Palladian window or Serlian motif) is a distinctive architectural element that consists of a central arched window flanked by two smaller rectangular windows. This design is often used in classical architecture and has been widely employed in Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical buildings. Although Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) did not invent it, the window features largely in the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580) and is almost a trademark of his early career. The true Palladian window is an elaborated version. Both the Venetian window or Serlian window and the Palladian window were inspired by Hellenistic and Roman examples which are part of the classical tradition and related to prestige and sacredness. 

==Overview==
The Venetian window consists of an arched central light, symmetrically flanked by two shorter sidelights. Each sidelight is flanked by two columns or pilasters and topped by a small entablature. The entablatures serve as imposts supporting the semicircular arch that tops the central light. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Serlio in his seven-volume architectural book &quot;Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospetiva&quot; expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that first appeared in the triumphal arches of ancient Rome.

Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrance to Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio&#x27;s work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodeled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones&#x27;s designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.

==Palladian window==
The Palladian window or &quot;Palladio motif&quot; is Palladio&#x27;s elaboration of this, normally used in a series. It places a larger or giant order in between each window, and doubles the small columns supporting the side lintels, placing the second column behind rather than beside the first. This is introduced in the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza, where it is used on both storeys; this feature was less often copied. Here the openings are not strictly windows, as they enclose a loggia. Pilasters might replace columns, as in other contexts. Sir John Summerson suggests that the omission of the doubled columns may be allowed, but &quot;the term &quot;Palladian motif&quot; should be confined&quot; to cases where the larger order is present.

==Variants==
A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent&#x27;s executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.

The Ipswich window is another variant.

== Origins and Development ==
The Venetian window design originates from the Renaissance period and is strongly associated with the Italian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580), who used it extensively in his works. However, its conceptual origins can be traced back to the earlier architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554), who described a similar window form in his treatise &quot;Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospettiva&quot; (1537). Because of Serlio’s early documentation, the window is sometimes referred to as a Serlian window.

Palladio further refined the form and integrated it into his villas and palaces, which led to its popularization across Europe and later in the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries.

== Characteristics ==
A typical Venetian window consists of:
* A large &quot;central arched opening&quot; that provides a focal point.
* Two &quot;smaller rectangular side windows&quot; that are usually separated from the central arch by slender columns or pilasters.
* A &quot;decorative entablature&quot; or cornice that unifies the composition.
* Sometimes a &quot;balustrade or balcony&quot; beneath the window, especially in grand residences and palaces.

== Usage in Architecture ==
=== Italian Renaissance and Palladianism ===
Andrea Palladio extensively incorporated the Venetian window motif into his architectural designs, particularly in his villa and palace facades. One of the most famous examples is the Villa Godi (1542), where Palladio utilized the motif to enhance symmetry and grandeur.

=== Baroque and Neoclassical Revival ===
During the Baroque and Neoclassical periods, the Venetian window became a favored design element in both Europe and North America. In England, architects such as Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (1694–1753) incorporated Palladian windows into their designs, further cementing their association with Palladianism. Notable examples include:
* Chiswick House, London (1729)
* The White House, Washington, D.C. (1792–1800), where Palladian windows are seen in its design.

=== American Colonial and Federal Architecture ===
The motif was widely used in American Colonial and Federal architecture, often appearing in grand homes and public buildings. It was particularly popular in the designs of Thomas Jefferson, who integrated Palladian elements into his works such as:
* Monticello, Virginia (1772)
* The Virginia State Capitol, Richmond (1788)

== Modern Adaptations ==
In modern architecture, the Venetian window remains a popular design element, often appearing in neoclassical and revivalist buildings. Contemporary adaptations may incorporate materials like aluminum and glass, while maintaining the fundamental tripartite composition.

<text>Hughenden is a rural town and locality in the Flinders Shire, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Hughenden had a population of 1,113 people.
== Geography ==
Hughenden is situated on the banks of the Flinders River.

Hughenden has the following mountains (from west to east):

* Mount Walker () 
* Mount Mowbray () 
* Mount Devlin () 
* Mount Castor () 
* Mount Beckford () 

Hughenden is located on the Flinders Highway, west of Townsville and north-west of Brisbane, the state capital. The region around Hughenden is a major centre for the grazing of sheep and cattle. The main feed is annual grasses known as Flinders grass, which grow rapidly on the (by Australian standards) fertile grey or brown cracking clay soils after rain between November and March. However, because the rainfall is extremely erratic – at Hughenden itself it has ranged from in 1926 to in 1950 – droughts and floods are normal and stock numbers fluctuate greatly.

The runoff from the Flinders River is much too erratic to provide a sustainable supply for any crop-growing via irrigation.

Hughenden is on the Great Northern railway line with a number of railway stops in the locality (from west to east):

* Ballindalloch railway station, now abandoned ()
*Hughenden West railway station, now abandoned (.
*Hughenden railway station, serving the town ()
*Hughenden East railway station, now abandoned ()
*Pooroga railway station, now abandoned ()
Hughenden was a terminus for the former Hughenden-Winton railway line with the following rail stops in the locality (north to south):

* Dividing Siding railway siding point, now abandoned ().
* Watten railway station, now abandoned ().
Hughenden Airport is to the north-east of the town ().

==History==
The upper Flinders River area has been occupied by the Yirandhali people from around 11,000 years ago. Jirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin.

Dalleburra (also known as Dalebura, Dal-leyburra, Yirandali) is a language of North-West Queensland, particularly Lammermoor Station via Hughenden. The Dalleburra language region includes the local government boundaries of the Flinders Shire Council.

The region in the vicinity of Hughenden was originally known as Mokana in the Yirandhali language.

British occupation began in October 1861 with the expedition group led by Frederick Walker camping near the site of the future township of Hughenden. Pastoralists soon followed and in 1863. Ernest Henry and his cousin Robert Gray established the Hughenden sheep station. Hughenden was named after Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire, England, the home of former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Robert Gray and Ernest Henry both had a family connection with Hughenden Manor. Their grandfather, John Norris owned the property until it was sold to Disraeli on Norris&#x27;s death. It was also owned by John&#x27;s father, also named John Norris, a wealthy merchant and member of the famous Hellfire Club. 

The actual town of Hughenden began in 1870 as a barracks for the paramilitary Native Police with sub-Inspector Harry Finch and his six troopers constructing the simple buildings at the junction of Station Creek with the Flinders River. In 1877, William Mark built a pub near the barracks and in August of that year the township site was officially surveyed and allotments made available for purchase.

Hughenden Post Office opened on 1 July 1878 (a receiving office had been open from 1874).

Hughenden Provisional School opened on 22 April 1880, becoming Hughenden State School in 1884. On 30 January 1968, it was expanded to have a secondary department.

In November 1883, &quot;Hughenden West Estate&quot; made up of 37 allotments were advertised to be auctioned by Wilson, Ayton and Ryan of Townsville. A map advertising the auction states the allotments are charmingly situated on high sloping ground, overlooking the Town of Hughenden, within a few minutes walk to the Post and Telegraph Offices, the Court House and the business centre of town. The map also states these residence sites only need the completion of the railway works to enormously increase its value.

Hughenden North Provisional School opened , becoming Hughenden North State School on 1 January 1909. Due to low attendances, it closed in 1926.

St Francis&#x27; Catholic School was opened on 1 October 1900 by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan.

Torrens Creek near Hughenden is where the Americans stored explosives in World War II. The Americans didn&#x27;t know of the dangerous bush fires out there. After they put out a fire they went back to camp thinking that the fire was out. However, the fire took hold again without them knowing. They then heard about twelve major explosions in succession; the explosions left craters twenty feet deep. Hot shrapnel covered a wide area and started more fires. In the townships, people said that buildings shook and windows broke, and some people were convinced that an air raid had occurred. Thousands of soldiers and civilians attacked the blaze in an attempt to stop it spreading to fuel dumps, but were unable to control it. When the fire got to the explosives it was so powerful it blew the Americans out of their trucks. Many buildings and shops got burnt down from the spreading fires. However the locals were able to save the post office. A police Constable from Torrens Creek Police was awarded the King&#x27;s Medal of Bravery.
In June 1945, it was announced that a new court house would be built in Hughenden in the 1945-1946 financial year with architectural plans drawn up in August 1945. However, it was not until September 1946 that the Executive Council of the Queensland Government approved expenditure of £31,560 for the project. In September 1947, the project stopped because it was determined that the foundations would not support a 2-storey building and that the new court house would have to be redesigned as single-level building. In January 1950, the new plans for the one-storey building were announced and by October that year, the construction was progressing in &quot;leaps and bounds&quot;. A shortage of cement appears to have delayed the project until 10,000 tons of cement was imported from England in January 1951. By January 1952, three-quarters of the framing had been completed while the project was suffering from a shortage of skilled labour and the cost having risen to an estimated £60,000. In October 1954 the court house was described as &quot;almost completed&quot;, but it was not until 1955 that the court house opened.

In 1960, the Hughenden branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association opened their hall.

On 9 June 2003 in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, Mrs Jean Eva Anderson of Ballater Station of Stamford was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her &quot;service to the community of Hughenden, particularly through the Country Womens Association&quot;. She had given 52 years of service to the Hughenden branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association. Her award was presented to her by the Governor of Queensland, Quentin Bryce.

In August 2008, Hughenden hosted the first Arid Lands Festival and The Great Hughenden Camel Endurance Challenge.

<text>The Albatros C.I, (post-war company designations L.6 &amp; L.7), was a twin-seat general-purpose biplanes designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Albatros Flugzeugwerke. It was the first of the successful C-series aircraft operated by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;.

During the opening year of the First World War, unarmed aircraft such as the Albatros B.II became increasingly vulnerable to the increasing numbers of armed military aircraft fielded by the Allies. In response to a requirement formulated in late 1914, Albatros designed the C.I; based on the B.II, the C.I reversed the pilot and observer seating so that the observer occupied the rear cockpit which was provisioned with a machine gun, typically a ring-mounted 7.92 mm (0.312 in) Parabellum MG14. The aircraft was also furnished with a more powerful powerplant, such as the Benz Bz.III or a Mercedes D.III engine, and had relatively favourable flying characteristics.

During late April 1915, the type entered frontline service with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;; it quickly proved itself to be a success and 228 aircraft were operational by the end of the year, comprising 42% of the total strength of C-type aircraft. Amongst its various roles, it became used as a fighter aircraft, noted pilots such as Oswald Boelcke and Manfred von Richthofen flew in the type. It performed various mission roles, including aerial reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and even bombing. Improvements to the C.I ultimately resulted in the Albatros C.III, which led to the aircraft being withdrawn from active combat on the Western Front during 1916. It continued to be used in the secondary trainer role, being outfitted with dual controls for training new pilots as well as observers. The C.I remained operational in German service through to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the conflict. The C.I saw further use in the hands of other operators, including the Lithuanian Air Force, Polish Air Force, and the Swedish Air Force.

==Design and development==
In late 1914, the German &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, the air service of the Imperial German Army, developed a requirement for two-seat aircraft, the C-type, powered by engines of at least and armed with at least one machine gun. The Albatros Flugzeugwerke&#x27;s design team, headed by the aeronautical engineer Robert Thelen, opted to produce an aircraft to fulfil this requirement; this aircraft, the C.I, was a development of Albatros&#x27; unarmed B.II biplane. This new design was visibly larger than the preceding aircraft. Other key differences between the C.I and the B.II included its use of a more powerful engine, while the pilot was moved to the front cockpit, the observer being instead seated in the rear cockpit and provided with a flexibly mounted machine gun, which was usually a Parabellum MG 14, but sometimes the less satisfactory Bergmann MG 15 was also used.

The fuselage of the C.I was, much like the B.II, was primarily composed of plywood. The primary structural members comprised four longerons of mixed construction, comprising ash forward of the cockpit and spruce to the aft, to which numerous plywood slab panels lining the aircraft were attached. The design of the fuselage, which eliminated the need for internal bracing, was commonplace amongst the company&#x27;s twin-seat aircraft. Again similar to the B.II, the aircraft&#x27;s wing structure had the rearward of its two spars positioned roughly in the middle of the wing, which made the trailing edge atypically flexible and thus gave the aircraft a level of inherent stability. None of the flight control surfaces were balanced.

The C.I was powered by a Benz Bz.III or a Mercedes D.III engine, which were both water-cooled six-cylinder inline engines, depending on availability. Aircraft flown by the Imperial German Navy were equipped with the Rapp Rp III engine, as the service had been denied access to the preferred Benz or Mercedes engines. Despite attention paid by the design team to streamlining the aircraft in general, this was somewhat negated by the radiators. The majority of early aircraft had their radiators attached to the side of the fuselage, but this arrangement was substituted for on later-built C.Is, which instead used a radiator that was fitted to the centre-section of the upper wing&#x27;s leading edge. 

During 1915, roughly 485 C.Is were ordered from Albatros while a further 88 C.Is were ordered from Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft (which used the trade name Roland for its aircraft). Furthermore, 56 C.Is were ordered from Albatros&#x27; Austro-Hungarian subsidiary &quot;Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke&quot; (OAW) for the Austro-Hungarian Aviation Troops. 

In 1917, in response to a growing demands for training its aircrew, the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; placed a series of very large orders for trainer aircraft, which included the C.I. The Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke (BFW) built the C.Ia, designed to be powered by the Argus As III, while the C.Ib, powered by a Mercedes D.III, was built by Mercur Flugzeugbau. During August 1918, Albatros and Mercur received orders for a new trainer version, the C.If, with pneumatic springs replacing the rubber shock cords used in the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage owing to shortages of raw materials, although it unclear how many, if any, C.Ifs were completed. Improvements to the C.I resulted in the Albatros C.III which became the most prolific of the Albatros C-types.

==Operational history==

During late April 1915, the C.I began to reach frontline units of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;; it served in aerial reconnaissance, artillery spotting, bombing, and photography roles. The type proved to be successful, demonstrating its favourable performance, easy handling, and robust construction, qualities that made the aircraft popular with its crews.

Its effective armament also resulted in the C.I being used as a fighter aircraft; Oswald Boelcke claimed his first victory while flying a C.I with Lt. von Wühlisch as the gunner. When flown in the fighter role, pilots often flew relatively aggressively, intentionally positioning their aircraft into favourable positions for the observer to open fire upon enemies. Boelcke&#x27;s success quickly inspired other crews; Germany&#x27;s most famous aviator of the First World War, Manfred von Richthofen, also began his career as an observer in the C.I on the Eastern Front. Typically, those pilots who demonstrated their effectiveness in the fighter role with the C.I would be transferred to dedicated fighter aircraft.

Throughout the rest of 1915, increasing numbers of C.Is were delivered and introduced; by the end of that year, it had become one of the most numerous C-type aircraft of the front, comprising 228 aircraft or 42% of the total strength of C-type aircraft in service. Despite these numbers, the type had a relatively short frontline service life, being phased out of use on the Western Front during 1916 after units were replaced by the more capable Albatros C.III. The C.I continued to see frontline action on the Eastern Front against the Russians well into 1917.

The C.I&#x27;s viceless handling heavily lent the type to its future use in the training role. It was operated for both the training of the crews of observation aircraft and, when outfitted with dual controls, as a pilot trainer. In this capacity, the aircraft remained in use by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; through to the end of the conflict.

<doc id="1109714" wikidata="Q17029980" url="?curid=1109714" title="Historical colours, standards and guidons">
<text>The following is a list of historical military colours, standards and guidons in different countries that do not exist today.

==France==
===Middle Ages===

During the Middle Ages, units did not have specific colours attached to them; rather, they often wore the heraldry of their lord. The armies of France often used the fleur-de-lis, a symbol of the Capetian dynasty. The King of France also had an official battle standard, the Oriflamme: a special flag, red with gold, and the motto &quot;Montjoie Saint-Denis&quot;. When the Oriflamme was taken into battle, it signified that there would be no quarter given to the enemy. English soldiers during the same time period sometimes wore Saint George&#x27;s Cross as a symbol of identification.

===Ancien Régime (15th-18th centuries)===
The French colours of the Ancien Régime got the same design: a white cross, the Cross of France (vertical cross, but sometimes it was a St Andrew&#x27;s cross, like the &quot;Royal Deux Ponts&quot; Régiment&#x27;s flag). The rest of the standard was depending on the regiment. Often, the Cross of France divided the flag in four equal quarters. The quarters could have the same colour (specially for the Marine troops&#x27;s flags). Sometimes, there were two colours: the top-left and the bottom-right quarters of one colour, the top-right and the bottom-left of another. In the most part of the time, lys flowers were on the Cross of France, with an inscription or a motto. The regiment often got the name of their province: Picardie (the oldest regiment of Europe), Normandie, Piemont, Provence... but were also called with special names, like &quot;Régiment de la Reine&quot; (Queen&#x27;s regiment), which had a dark green and black quartered flag, with the cross of France.
Each regiment had its flag. The colonel, at the head of the regiment, had a special flag: it also had the white Cross of France, but the four quarters were white too (white was the colour of the French monarchy). The actual flag of Quebec has exactly the design of the French colours of this time. The same pattern was used by regiments made up of foreign nationals who served with the Royal Army infantry.

===Revolutionary Army===
In 1794, the French Army was reorganised following the Revolution. Regiments were renamed demi-brigades, with three battalions in each. The 1st Battalion of each was raised from the volunteers, while the 3rd Battalion were conscripts. These two received identical colours. The 2nd Battalion meanwhile was formed from a regiment of the old Royal Army, and received a different colour from the 1st Battalion. The colours of all of the 2nd Battalions were identical to each other (except for the demi-brigade&#x27;s number), while the 1st Battalions all received different colours.

===Imperial Grand Army ===
In the Imperial Army under Napoleon I, regiments received new colours, which were called &quot;aigles&quot; (eagles), from the eagle that was mounted atop the pole. The designs differed per speciality.

==== Infantry ====

Up to 1812, the colours of infantry regiments resembled the colours of the Revolutionary Army, specifically the 1st Demi-Brigade of infantry, with a white diamond and the corners filled in (from clockwise top left) red-blue-red-blue. The name of the regiment was written in gold on the obverse, and the words Valeur et Discipline, together with the battalion number, on the reverse. The regiment&#x27;s number was written in gold in the four corners. In 1812, a new pattern of colours was authorised; this used the French Tricolour, fringed in gold, and with various regimental and imperial devices forming a frame around the gold writing. The obverse bore the name of the regiment, while the reverse saw listed its battle honours. However, only those actions in which the Emperor himself had participated were permitted to be displayed, so some regiments had nothing on the reverse of their colours. Only the 1st Battalion of each regiment was issued with this Colour; subsequent battalions were issued with plain, coloured marker flags (a practice that began in 1809); although the regulations issued specifically prohibited the addition of any inscriptions or insignia, many battalions did so to allow them to stand out.

*Battalion Flag Colours after 1812
**1st Battalion - Regimental Colour
**2nd Battalion - White Flag
**3rd Battalion - Red Flag
**4th Battalion - Blue Flag
**5th Battalion - Green Flag
**6th Battalion - Yellow Flag
*The regiments of the Imperial Guard were subjected to a similar pattern after 1812, with the 1st Battalion of the senior regiments carrying the regiment&#x27;s Colour, and subsequent battalions carrying plain red flags with either grenades (for grenadier regiments) or hunting horns (for chasseur regiments) in the centre and at the corners. The Middle and Young Guards infantry carried battalion marker flags as well.

==== Cavalry, artillery, military trains and engineers ====
From 1804 to 1812, the cavalry and artillery of the Imperial Army used similar designs for the unit standards. The line heavy cavalry regiments (cuirassiers and carabiniers) and all hussar formations, as well as the foot artillery companies, carried standards with similar inscriptions as the infantry while the line cavalry regiments of dragoons and the lancers and &quot;Chasseurs-à-Cheval&quot;, as well as the horse artillery, all had swallowtailed guidons. In 1812 the designs were unified, with both now having unit standards of the same design as the infantry with the battle honours. The regiments of engineers, as well as the pontoon units attached to the artillery, also carried infantry-style colours. The artillery and logistics trains, till 1812, carried swallowtailed guidons due to their mounted role.

In 1810, the standards and guidions of Imperial Guard cavalry formations raised before 1809 carried grenades or hunting horns in their colours depending on their role.

==Germany==

===Kingdom of Prussia===
King Frederick II - known to history as Frederick the Great - ascended the throne of Prussia in 1740. Shortly thereafter he began to issue colours of a new pattern to the infantry regiments of the Prussian Army. Under the new regulations, each regiment received two flags per battalion. The first battalion carried the King&#x27;s Colour (&quot;leibfahne&quot;) and one Regimental Colour (&quot;regimentsfahne&quot;), while the second battalion carried two regimentsfahnen. The Leibfahne had a white field and the Regimentsfahne had a field in the distinguishing colour of the regiment. In the center of both colours was a circular tablet bearing the crowned Prussian eagle under a scroll inscribed &quot;Pro Gloria et Patria&quot; (For Glory and Fatherland), all within a wreath surmounted by the royal crown. The corners were decorated with crowned royal cyphers (FR for Fredericus Rex) The colours of the wreath, crown and cyphers could be either gold or silver. Unusually, Prussian infantry colours were longer at the hoist than on the fly, measuring 140 by 120 centimetres. Cords and tassels were silver and black. The colours were made of silk, with insignia painted on. The colours of the regular infantry regiments remained virtually unchanged from 1742 until 1806, when catastrophic defeat at the hands of Napoleon all but destroyed the once-proud Prussian Army. When new flags were issued to the reconstituted army beginning in 1811-12, their design was based on the original pattern, but with a number of modifications.

In cavalry formations, the same pattern prevailed, with the 1st Squadron or Battalion of cavalry (Cuirassier and Hussar since 1744) regiments carrying the King&#x27;s Standard (&quot;Leibstandarte&quot;) and a Squadron Standard (&quot;Eskadronsstandarte&quot;). Dragoon regiments had swallowtailed standards (&quot;Leibfahne&quot; and &quot;Eskadronsfahne&quot;) in unit colours. The Garde du Corps had a Roman styled vellixum standard carried solely by the 1st squadron, while the other squadrons carried lances with the eagle finial.

===Third Reich===

**Army: The pattern of the colours for the German Army of the Third Reich was instituted in 1936. It encompasses a square white flag with a black Iron Cross extending nearly to the edges; the cross has a silver border followed by a thinner black edge and a white fimbriation; in each corner is a black swastika. At the center of the flag is a white disk surrounded by a silver wreath and containing a black (&quot;Army type&quot;) eagle grasping a black swastika. The colour of the background varied depending on the branch of the service. Cavalry and artillery had the same pattern, but as a swallow tailed &quot;standarte&quot; (standard) rather than an ordinary &quot;fahne&quot;. Later, similar designs debuted for mechanized formations.
**Luftwaffe: The ground troops of the Luftwaffe were given different colours to those of the army. It was either red (for anti-aircraft troops), yellow (for flying units) or green (for field troops), with a black lined white diagonal cross. On the obverse in the centre was an Iron Cross on top of a silver wreath. In each corner was a black swastika, with the whole flag trimmed in silver. The reverse was identical except for a silver (Luftwaffe type) eagle replacing the Iron Cross.
**Navy: The colours of the Kriegsmarine were similar in design to those of the Luftwaffe. The flag itself was blue, with a black swastika replacing the eagle. The wreath was gold instead of black, as were the diagonal lines. In the corners were gold anchors (top left, bottom right) and Iron Crosses (top right, bottom left). On the other side was an Iron Cross in the centre, with gold eagles replacing the two Iron Crosses in the corners. The flag was fringed in gold. Similar colours were used by all ground formations of the service, including the naval infantry and artillery.
**Waffen SS: The colours awarded to the Waffen SS infantry were completely different from those of the rest of the armed forces. It was essentially the national flag, fringed with gold, with the battalion and regiment numbers in the top left hand corner. Cavalry and motorized formations carried a swallowtailed variant. SS divisions, like the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, based their banners from the earlier models, notably the SA &quot;GERMANY AWAKE&quot; () banner; later the LSSAH replaced the early banner with a variant of Hitler&#x27;s Personal Standard. All of the SS divisional banner poles are of the Roman vexillum style, as evident of the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 flag throwing at Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum by the NKVD.

==Mongolia==
In Mongolia, the Tug is generally regarded as a type of historical military symbol that is the equivalent to a military colour. It is a circular pole with attached horse or yak tail hairs arranged at the top. It was introduced and was flown during the period of the Mongol Empire, and was later adopted by Turco-Mongol, Turkic khanates and the Ottoman Empire.

==Portugal==
===Constitutional Monarchy===

During the period of the Constitucional Monarchy (1834-1910), each of the regiments and other independent units of the Portuguese Army had a regimental colour, which was the variant of the then Flag of Portugal, the field being vertically divided in blue and white, with the Royal coat of arms in the centre, surrounded by two golden olive branches tied by a red ribbon carrying the Order of Christ Cross, and the royal cypher at each corner. Under the arms there was a white ribbon containing the number of the unit in the obverse of the colour and the regimental title in the verse. The colour was square with 130 cm each side. 

The flags of the mounted units were similar, but were named &quot;standards&quot; and were smaller, with 80 cm each side.

==Russia==

===Russian Empire===
Colours in the Imperial Russian Army were introduced in the 18th century. Large regimental flags were reserved for infantry units while small, easy to carry flags were used in the cavalry and horse artillery. Regulations in 1797 were introduced to give the military a guideline when awarding colours. New designs for regular infantry units were made, with the state color consisting of white with the state emblem and the assigned colors of the company/battalion/regiment using a different emblem. 

In 1812 the former tradition, a Russian adaptation of the British practice, was replaced with the use of the regimental colour or standard as the sole colour for all units.

===Soviet Union===
Each unit in the armed forces of the Soviet Union had its own Regimental Colour, which was produced to a standard design from the 1930s onward:
*Obverse - red field, a red star yellow bordered and the full name and number of a military unit below. Each unit has its own inscription.
*Reverse - red field, a gold hammer and sickle and the motto &quot;For our Soviet Motherland!&quot; (&quot;За нашу советскую родину!&quot;, &quot;Za nashu sovyetskuyu rodinu&quot;)
All the Colours were red with gold fringe and square in form.

The former designs (issued from 1925) had a red star on the reverse with the name of the Central Executive Committee and later, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR surrounding it, and the obverse had the unit inscription below the State Emblem of the Soviet Union, which had the Soviet Union state motto (&quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;) and the red star with the hammer and sickle inside (both were on the flag of the Soviet Union) above it (the latter was near the hoist). (Distinguished units would be given a second colour, the Revolutionary Red Banner of Honour, by the all-Union CEC (before 1924 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee).)

The Naval Flags used by the Soviet Navy are white with a bottom blue stripe and were based on the naval ensign. Above it are the USSR&#x27;s national symbols, the hammer and the sickle, beside the red star. If a naval unit is a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner, the medal of the order replaced the star.

====Guards Regiments====
The Colours of those regiments that were classed as &#x27;Guards&#x27; was slightly different. These had the portrait of Lenin, the &quot;Za nashu&quot; motto and the abbreviation &quot;USSR&quot; (&quot;СССР&quot;) on the obverse and the small star with hammer and sickle in its centre, unit&#x27;s name and a motto on the reverse. The mottoes were different for different regiments (for example, those regiments made Guards in the Great Patriotic War bore the motto &#x27;Death to the German Invaders!&#x27;). Naval Guards units had a Guards ribbon included in the Naval ensign whenever a ship becomes a Guards ship.

==Spain==
===Kingdom of Spain===
An army regulation of July 1810 stated that line infantry regiments of the Spanish army would bear two colours. The first battalion would carry the &quot;coronela&quot; (King&#x27;s Colour), which was white and bore the Royal Coat of Arms in the centre, sometimes on top of a burgundy Cross, surrounded by various regimental devices, while the second battalion (and independent battalions of light infantry) would carry the &quot;sencilla&quot; (Regimental Colour), which would have a burgundy cross with the provincial coat of arms at the four corners, and the name of the regiment in the top half. In 1843, the regulations introduced a new pattern for regimental colours, with the sencilla replaced by the &quot;batallona&quot;. This was a flag that adopted the national colours of red-yellow-red horizontal stripes, with a simplified royal coat of arms in the centre atop a small burgundy cross and the name of the regiment encircling it.

===Spain under Franco===
Following the victory of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish army adopted the policy of using only a single colour, the batallona, with the new coat of arms in its centre replacing the Royal arms, and the name of the regiment encircling it.

<doc id="1109717" wikidata="Q549774" url="?curid=1109717" title="Songs from the Big Chair">
<text>Songs from the Big Chair is the second studio album by the English band Tears for Fears, released on 25 February 1985 by Mercury Records, distributed by Phonogram Inc. A follow-up to the band&#x27;s successful debut album, &quot;The Hurting&quot; (1983), &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was a significant departure from that album&#x27;s dark, introspective synth-pop, featuring a more mainstream, guitar-based pop rock sound, sophisticated production values and diverse stylistic influences, while Roland Orzabal and Ian Stanley&#x27;s lyrics displayed socially and politically conscious themes.

The album peaked at number two in the UK and at number one in the U.S., becoming a multi-platinum seller and the band&#x27;s most successful studio album to date. The singles &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; both topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top 5 of the UK Singles Chart, while &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; and a live version of &quot;I Believe&quot; were also successful internationally. Receiving positive critical reviews upon release, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; has accrued lasting praise and has been named one of the 1980s&#x27; best albums and was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Background==
The album was to be titled &quot;The Working Hour&quot;, but Roland Orzabal thought to change it to &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;, a title derived from the 1976 American television film &quot;Sybil&quot; about a woman with multiple personality disorder who only feels safe when sitting in her analyst&#x27;s &quot;big chair.&quot; The title reflects the band&#x27;s opinion that they were the targets of a hostile British music press. 

In an interview for the 2006 deluxe-version booklet, Curt Smith noted: &quot;We were very introverted on &quot;The Hurting&quot;; it was a very dark album. We found the need to be more outgoing on &quot;The Big Chair.&quot;&quot;
The band started to generate new material around the beginning of 1984. The first song written for the album was &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, which the band played live during a tour undertaken between the two studio albums.

==Writing and recording==
The album was recorded at The Wool Hall in 1984. Conceptually and musically, it further developed the band&#x27;s sound from the previous studio album &quot;The Hurting&quot; (1983), reintroducing guitars to their electronic sound and imparting a lighter approach overall. Early songs written for the album included &quot;Head over Heels&quot; and &quot;The Working Hour&quot;. &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; was released months before the album as a single. These songs, as well as &quot;We Are Broken&quot;, were all performed on the Tears for Fears 1983 tour. The song &quot;Shout&quot; became a central work during the recording of the album, and the band and producer Chris Hughes spent months working on the track.

The album utilises many styles and influences, and progressive rock was cited as a primary influence on the album. &quot;I Believe&quot; was influenced by the songwriting of Robert Wyatt. &quot;Broken&quot; is a reworking of an earlier song and a live version is repeated at the end of &quot;Head over Heels&quot;. The largely instrumental &quot;Listen&quot; has been described as a symphonic piece. Lyrically, the psychological themes on &quot;The Hurting&quot; were continued and extended to include a variety of themes such as politics, war, money and love.

Near the end of the completion of the album, Roland Orzabal played two simple chords on his acoustic guitar that formed the foundation of the song &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;. Although he was initially not interested in working on it, Orzabal was convinced to write a song based on the two chords and he added the chorus line. The song was completed in about a week and was the last track recorded for the album.

==Release==
&quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was released on 25 February 1985 with a black and white photograph of Orzabal and Smith on the record cover.

The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and spawned five commercially successful singles: &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; (UK #14), &quot;Shout&quot; (UK #4), &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; (UK #2), &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (UK #12), and &quot;I Believe&quot; (UK #23). 

The radio-friendly &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; marked the band&#x27;s breakthrough in the United States; both this single and its follow-up, &quot;Shout&quot;, reached number one in the U.S. &quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot; also reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold five million copies in the U.S. alone. In the UK, the album spent 79 consecutive weeks on the album chart, remaining on the chart for 18 months until September 1986.

To mark the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Universal Music released the album in five different formats on 10 November 2014.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; received generally positive reviews. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the record at number 95 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it 87th.

===Contemporary===

In &quot;NME&quot;, Danny Kelly called &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; &quot;a calculated and brilliant peak, a quintessence of polished pop putty ... perfect at its shimmering surface, worthless to its craven core.&quot; He described it as a descendant of 10cc&#x27;s &quot;The Original Soundtrack&quot; (1975) and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973)–&quot;a product of obsessional care and attention to (often unnecessary) detail.&quot;

Johnny Waller of &quot;Sounds&quot; awarded the album four and a half stars out of five and said that compared with their debut, &quot;Tears for Fears have lovingly crafted a new masterpiece with softer, smoky vocals, more tempting melodies and less abrasive rhythms.&quot; He called the record &quot;glorious pop&quot; and added that &quot;within accepted confines, Tears for Fears are stretching and growing, expanding both their imagination and their horizons.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Don Shewey found Tears for Fears reminiscent of various other acts, noting traces of &quot;U2&#x27;s social conscience, the Bunnymen&#x27;s echoing guitars and XTC&#x27;s contorted pop wit&quot; but commented that Chris Hughes&#x27; &quot;sparkling&quot; production &quot;nudges &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; slightly ahead of the pack.&quot; Ian Cranna of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; described the album as &quot;looser, more exploratory&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous work and praised its &quot;unflinching lyrical honesty.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, noted the &quot;uncommon command of guitar and piano, Baker Street sax, synthesizers more jagged than is deemed mete by the arbiters of dance-pop accessibility&quot; but beneath a prevailing &quot;portentous&quot; mood, suggesting &quot;a depth and drama English lads have been falling short on since the dawn of progressive rock.&quot; Barry McIlheney of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that &quot;none of you should really be too surprised that Tears for Fears have made such an &quot;excellent&quot; album&quot;, calling it &quot;an album that fully justifies the rather sneering, told-you-so looks adopted by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal on the sleeve&quot;

===Retrospective===
AllMusic, Stanton Swihart wrote that &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; &quot;heralded a dramatic maturation in the band&#x27;s music, away from the synth-pop brand with which it was (unjustly) seared following the debut, and towards a complex, enveloping pop sophistication&quot;, deeming it &quot;one of the finest statements of the decade.&quot; Mark Elliott of &quot;Record Collector&quot; said that the album found Tears for Fears &quot;making it big, coating their consistently interesting material in a high-gloss commercial sheen that captured the mid-80s zeitgeist perfectly&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; highlighted its &quot;sound of spotlit, spacious sophistication plus anthemic choruses you&#x27;d bet your house on.&quot; Writing for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; in 2006, Andrew Unterberger concluded that &quot;even today, when all rock musicians seem to be able to do is be &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;honest&quot;, the brutality and power of &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;″s catharsis is still quite shocking.&quot;

In February 2020, the album was the focus of an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary series. The episode included new interviews with key personnel including Orzabal, Smith, Ian Stanley, producer Chris Hughes, engineer Dave Bascombe, Oleta Adams, John Grant and A&amp;R man David Bates.

<doc id="1109720" wikidata="Q1700139" url="?curid=1109720" title="John Fru Ndi">
<text>Ni John Fru Ndi (7 July 1941 – 12 June 2023) was a Cameroonian politician who served as first and founding Chairman of the Social Democratic Front (SDF), the main opposition party in Cameroon, from party foundation in 1990 to his death in 2023. He failed to be elected as a senator in 2013.

==Early life and education ==
Fru Ndi was born in Baba II, near Bamenda in the Northwest Province of Cameroon. The title of Ni (a mark of respect) was given to him when he was born. 

Fru Ndi attended school in Cameroon at the Baforchu Basel Mission and the Santa Native Authority before going to Nigeria to study (at Lagos City College) and work in 1957.

==Work before politics ==
In 1966, Fru Ndi returned to Cameroon and began selling vegetables.

Fru Ndi ran a bookstore in Bamenda, the Ebibi Book Centre, headed a football club from 1979 to 1988, and headed the Lions Club International branch in Bamenda from 1987 to 1988. 

== Political career ==
Fru Ndi was a candidate of the ruling Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (RDPC) in the Mezam Central constituency during the single-party 1988 parliamentary election, losing to a different RDPC list.

Fru Ndi was the founder of the SDF, an opposition party, in 1990. He was elected as the SDF&#x27;s National Chairman at its First Ordinary National Convention, held in Bamenda in May 1992. After that, he was popularly known as &quot;The Chairman&quot;. He campaigned for the rights of the English-speaking minority in the mostly French-speaking country, but wanted a federal, unified nation.

In the October 1992 presidential election, he made a strong showing against President Paul Biya, losing with 36% of the vote against Biya&#x27;s 40% according to official results (in Fru Ndi&#x27;s stronghold, Northwest Province, he officially won 86.3%). This election was condemned as fraudulent by the opposition, and Fru Ndi and third place opposition candidate Maigari Bello Bouba unsuccessfully sought for the election to be annulled by the Supreme Court. Amidst the outbreak of violence in the North-West Province that followed the election, Fru Ndi was placed under house arrest in late October 1992. After about a month, he was released. On 20 January 1993, Fru Ndi, along with his wife Rose, attended the inauguration of United States President Bill Clinton. He and Rose were photographed with Clinton and Clinton&#x27;s wife Hillary, and Fru Ndi&#x27;s presence at the event had a symbolic impact in Cameroon, giving the impression of recognition and legitimacy in light of Fru Ndi&#x27;s claim to have won the 1992 election.

Along with other opposition parties, the SDF chose to boycott the October 1997 presidential election. Fru Ndi was re-elected as SDF Chairman at the party&#x27;s fifth congress in April 1999, receiving 1,561 votes from delegates against 40 for his challenger, Chretien Tabetsing.

Fru Ndi was the SDF candidate in the October 2004 presidential election; according to official results, he took second place with 17.40% of the vote against 70.92% for Biya. He received his best results in Northwest Province (68.16%), followed by West Province (45.04%), Littoral Province (32.71%), and Southwest Province (30.59%).

Fru Ndi alleged fraud in the July 2007 parliamentary election and called for it to be annulled; in the election, the SDF won the second highest number of seats but was far behind the ruling RDPC, which won an overwhelming majority of seats. After the election, Fru Ndi said that Biya should recognize him as the official leader of the opposition.

Fru Ndi said on 14 November 2007 that he would be willing to meet with Biya. He said that Biya had not invited him to meet and that he had tried to meet Biya several times, contradicting Biya&#x27;s statement on French television that Fru Ndi had not responded to his invitation.

On 12 April 2008, Fru Ndi called for a national day of mourning on 21 April 2008 to commemorate the individuals who died during the 2008 anti-government protests and the &quot;death of democracy&quot; in Cameroon. Fru Ndi indicated that he believed the 2008 changes to the Constitution were intended to enable President Biya to be lifelong dictator of Cameroon and that the changes would institutionalize corruption, immunity, and inertia.

Fru Ndi again stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the October 2011 presidential election, placing a distant second behind Biya. A few days after the election, on 17 October 2011, Fru Ndi, alongside other presidential candidates, called an emergency meeting to demand that Biya annul the election.

In the April 2013 Senate election, Fru Ndi stood as a candidate in the Northwest Province, his primary support base. The indirect election marked the creation of the upper house of Parliament; previously only the National Assembly had existed. Fru Ndi failed to win a seat in the Senate. He alleged that the ruling party had bribed some SDF local councilors.

Fru Ndi took a critical stance against the Cameroonian government&#x27;s handling of the Anglophone Crisis, a war that affected him personally. In October 2018, Ambazonian separatists burned down his house in Bamenda. On 19 April 2019, his brother was kidnapped by gunmen, who demanded a ransom. Eight days later he was kidnapped himself, while visiting Kumbo, Northwest Region to attend the funeral of Joseph Banadzem, the Parliamentary group leader of the SDF. He was released shortly afterwards, with the SDF describing the whole affair as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; that was quickly solved. It was revealed the next day that the separatists had kidnapped Fru Ndi in order to get a chance to talk to him. In a video that appeared online, gunmen asked the SDF leader to withdraw all SDF legislators from the National Assembly and the senate. Fru Ndi replied that he would not, stating that doing so would be counterproductive.

In June 2019, Fru Ndi stated that while he was not a separatist, the government &quot;was pushing him&quot; in that direction. Fru Ndi made a point of always travelling without a security escort whenever he visited the Anglophone regions, stating that he was not afraid of his own people – including separatists.

September 2019, Fru Ndi was abducted from his residence in Bamenda by separatist fighters who demanded his support for their cause. He was later released unharmed, but the incident highlighted the growing insecurity in the anglophone regions.

Despite his efforts to promote peace, Fru Ndi faced criticism from some anglophone activists, who accused him of not doing enough to challenge the government&#x27;s actions.

== Personal life and death==
Fru Ndi&#x27;s first wife, Susan, died after giving birth in 1973. His second wife, Rose, to whom he was married for over 25 years, died in 2004. They had had several children. After her death he established a charitable foundation in her name.

Fru Ndi died at his home in Yaoundé, on 12 June 2023, at the age of 81. An obituary by BBC News called him a &quot;brave champion of democracy&quot;.

<doc id="1109738" wikidata="Q3371820" url="?curid=1109738" title="Paul Mba Abessole">
<text>Paul Mba Abessole (born October 9, 1939) is a Gabonese politician who heads the National Woodcutters&#x27; Rally – Rally for Gabon (&quot;Rassemblement national des Bûcherons - Rassemblement pour le Gabon&quot;, RNB-RPG) and was a leading opponent of President Omar Bongo during the 1990s. He stood as a presidential candidate twice during the 1990s and also served as Mayor of Libreville, the capital. From 2002 to 2009 he served in the government of Gabon, holding the rank of Deputy Prime Minister for most of that period.

==Career==
Mba Abessole was born at Ngnung-Ako, located in northern Gabon, in 1939. He attended a French seminary and was ordained as a Catholic priest on 30 June 1968. He worked as a priest in Gabon until 1976, when he went to France, where he then lived in exile. As a critic of President Bongo and the single-party regime of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), he sought to stand as a candidate against Bongo in the 1979 presidential election, but was unable to do so.

Mba Abessole was the exiled leader of MORENA during the 1980s and argued for peaceful political change in Gabon. President Bongo, hoping to indicate that he was open to reform, allowed Mba Abessole to visit Gabon for a week in May 1989. On that occasion he was &quot;treated more as a visiting dignitary than the leader of a suppressed political party&quot;; Bongo met with him and said that he would consider Mba Abessole&#x27;s proposed reforms. This conciliatory attitude from Bongo annoyed some PDG hard-liners. Following M&#x27;ba Abessole&#x27;s May 1989 visit, he returned to Gabon on a permanent basis in November 1989. Bongo offered to appoint Mba Abessole as Minister of Justice after the March–April 1990 National Conference, but Mba Abessole refused to participate in the government.

In the 1990 parliamentary election, Mba Abessole stood as a MORENA candidate in Libreville. In the first round, he received 49.44% of the vote in his constituency, slightly less than the majority required for a first round victory; suspecting fraud, he refused to participate in the second round and called for a boycott of the second round.

On October 5, 1993, Mba Abessole announced his candidacy for the December 1993 presidential election. He was the main opposition candidate in the election and placed second with 26.5%, according to official results, while Bongo was credited with a narrow first round majority. Denouncing the official results as fraudulent, Mba Abessole declared himself President and appointed RNB First Secretary Pierre-André Kombila as Prime Minister. His house in Libreville, along with the opposition radio station Radio Liberty, was destroyed by the Presidential Guard in February 1994, and he went to Paris. In March 1994, Prime Minister Casimir Oye Mba offered to include the RNB in the government, but Mba Abessole rejected the offer. He also refused to participate in the government of Prime Minister Paulin Obame-Nguema, which was formed after the signing of the Paris Accords between the government and the opposition in October 1994.

The RNB won the late 1996 municipal election in Libreville, and Mba Abessole was then elected as Mayor of Libreville by the city councillors on 19 January 1997; he received 68 out of 98 votes. Mba Abessole also stood in the December 1996 parliamentary election as a candidate in the fifth &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Libreville, but he was defeated by Jean-François Ntoutoume Emane.

Prior to the December 1998 presidential election, Kombila was expelled from the party in July 1998, leading Kombila&#x27;s supporters to form their own faction and nominate Kombila as their presidential candidate later in the month. Mba Abessole, who continued to lead the other faction, accused Kombila of &quot;treachery and indiscipline&quot;. Mba Abessole was officially designated as his faction&#x27;s presidential candidate at an extraordinary congress in Libreville in early October 1998. He was considered the most best-known opposition leader in Gabon; however, his credibility as an opposition leader was thought to have suffered, and it was believed that the RNB split would have a negative impact on his candidacy. In the election, he took third place with 13.16% of the vote, according to official results; Bongo won an overwhelming majority, while Pierre Mamboundou, who was perceived as a more radical opposition leader than Mba Abessole, placed second.

Mba Abessole defeated Jean Eyeghe Ndong for a seat in the National Assembly in the December 2001 parliamentary election, and on January 27, 2002 he was appointed to the government as Minister of State for Human Rights. He was subsequently promoted to the position of Deputy Prime Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Rural Development, in charge of Human Rights, on January 21, 2003. Later, his portfolio was modified and he was named Deputy Prime Minister for Transport, Civil Aviation, and Human Rights.

On April 23, 2004, Mba Abessole joined the Presidential Majority, the alliance of parties supporting President Bongo. A youth movement, the Movement of the Children of Bongo Ondimba, then asked Mba Abessole to serve as Bongo&#x27;s campaign manager for the 2005 presidential election; it also wanted him to become Prime Minister if Bongo won the election. Bongo accepted this as a possibility, and on June 26, 2004, Mba Abessole said that he was willing to take up the responsibility. However, others in the Presidential Majority resisted the idea of Mba Abessole becoming Bongo&#x27;s campaign manager.

He and Eyeghe Ndong faced each other again in the December 2006 parliamentary election, this time with Eyeghe Ndong holding the position of Prime Minister, and Mba Abessole was defeated. President Bongo said that holding a ministerial position was not dependent on winning a parliamentary seat and that Mba Abessole could remain a member of the government. In the new government, announced on January 25, 2007, Mba Abessole was moved to the position of Deputy Prime Minister at the Presidency in charge of Recasting, Human Rights, the Coordination of Great Work and Revolving Festivals.

In a Senate by-election held on July 1, 2007, Mba Abessole was elected to the first seat from the second &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Libreville, which had been vacated by Eyeghe Ndong. Mba Abessole was the only candidate for the seat and received the votes of all of the 20 electors in this indirect election. In the government named on December 28, 2007, he was moved to the position of Deputy Prime Minister for Culture, Arts, Community Education, Refoundation and Human Rights.

Mba Abessole headed the RPG&#x27;s list in the second &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Libreville during the April 2008 local elections. Subsequently he filed an unsuccessful challenge with the Constitutional Court related to the election.

Following Omar Bongo&#x27;s death in June 2009, the RPG held its 11th Extraordinary Congress on 11 July 2009 and nominated Mba Abessole, its President, as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 30 August 2009 presidential election. He was immediately backed by three other parties: the National Recovery Movement (MORENA) and the National Rally of Woodcutters (RNB), both part of the Presidential Majority, as well as the Party of Equal Opportunity (PEC), an opposition party. Mba Abessole was then excluded from the government appointed on 22 July 2009 under Prime Minister Paul Biyoghé Mba.

Together with several other candidates, Mba Abessole was present at a banned demonstration calling for the resignation of PDG presidential candidate Ali-Ben Bongo from the government on 7 August 2009. In mid-August he said in reference to the PDG&#x27;s selection of Bongo (Omar Bongo&#x27;s son) as its candidate that &quot;we are faced with a monarchy that wants to impose itself in our country&quot; and that &quot;we have to fight until the monarchists are thrown out&quot;.

In late August, immediately prior to the election, Mba Abessole and four other candidates announced that they were withdrawing their candidacies in favor of André Mba Obame, a former PDG minister who was standing as an independent candidate. Mba Obame placed second in the election with 26% of the vote, behind Bongo. The election was followed by serious violence in Port-Gentil. A few days after the announcement of results, Mba Abessole tried to travel to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire but was barred from doing so by police, who said that they were under orders to not allow opposition leaders to leave the country. The Interior Ministry explained on 9 September 2009 that this was because of a government investigation into the Port-Gentil rioting.

In the December 2011 parliamentary election, Mba Abessole was elected to the National Assembly, winning the third seat for Komo-Kango Department. In an election that saw the ruling PDG win an overwhelming majority of seats amidst an opposition boycott, Mba Abessole was one of only a handful of non-PDG candidates to win parliamentary seats. When the National Assembly began meeting for its new parliamentary term, Mba Abessole chaired the initial proceedings due to his status as the oldest deputy at age 72. He was then elected as the Fifth Vice-President of the National Assembly on 27 February 2012.

<doc id="1109746" wikidata="Q110287239" url="?curid=1109746" title="Onycha">
<text>Onycha (, ), along with equal parts of stacte, galbanum, and frankincense, was one of the components of the consecrated &quot;Ketoret&quot; (incense) which appears in the Torah book of Exodus (Ex.30:34-36) and was used in Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem. This formula was to be incorporated as an incense, and was not to be duplicated for non-sacred use. What the onycha of antiquity actually was cannot be determined with certainty. The original Hebrew word used for this component of the &quot;ketoret&quot; was שחלת, &quot;shecheleth&quot;, which means &quot;to roar; as a lion (from his characteristic roar)&quot; or “peeling off by concussion of sound.&quot; &quot;Shecheleth&quot; is related to the Syriac &quot;shehelta&quot; which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation.” In Aramaic, the root SHCHL signifies “retrieve.” When the Torah was translated into Greek (the Septuagint version) the Greek word “onycha” ονυξ, which means &quot;fingernail&quot; or &quot;claw,&quot; was substituted for shecheleth.

==Contenders for the identity of onycha==
===Operculum===

Some writers believe that onycha was &quot;Unguis odoratus&quot;, the fingernail-like operculum, or trap door, of certain sea snails, such as &quot;Strombus lentiginosus&quot;, &quot;Murex anguliferus&quot;, and &quot;Onyx marinus&quot;. It may be the operculum of a snail-like mollusk found in the Red Sea. This operculum is the trap door of a shell, called by the Latins &quot;Conchylium&quot;. These opercula may be of different sizes, but their overall shape is that of a claw, which is the origin of the name &quot;Unguis odoratus&quot;. The name &quot;Blatta Byzantina&quot; is occasioned by its having usually been imported from Constantinople, the ancient Byzantium. In antiquity the operculum was used as an ingredient in incense. The Babylonian Talmud recorded that onycha was rubbed with an alkali solution prepared from the bitter vetch to remove impurities, it was then soaked in the fermented berry juice of the Caper shrub, or a strong white wine, in order to enhance its fragrance. 

Although it was forgotten in the West after the fall of the Roman Empire, Murex opercula are still commonly used as an ingredient in traditional North African and Middle Eastern bakhoor (granulated incense), traditional Indian &quot;choya nakh&quot; attar (produced by dry distillation of Murex opercula ), and quite substantively in East Asian incense. From this perspective, some argue that this is the most likely source of onycha.

===Labdanum===

There is some doubt as to whether the onycha of the Hebrew Bible was the operculum of a sea snail. H. J. Abrahams says, &quot;The widely held mollusk hypothesis becomes quite perplexing if one considers that the mollusk was counted among the unclean animals in the Bible (Leviticus 11:9 and 12).&quot; Sea creatures such as the mollusk were an “abomination” and even their carcasses were to be considered an “abomination” and anyone simply touching them became unclean. Bahya ben Asher (d. 1340) insisted that only kosher species may be used for the mishkan. The Gemara states that “only items that one may eat may be used for the work of Heaven.” Nachmanides, Torah scholar and famed Jewish theologian, emphasized that the commandment concerning unclean animals pertained also to temple services. James Strong and J. McClintoch write that “it seems improbable that any such substance could have been one of the constituent spices of the most holy perfume; not only because we know of none bearing any powerful and agreeable odor, but specially because all marine creatures that were not finned and scaled fishes were unclean, and as such could not have been touched by the priests or used in the sanctuary.” Bahr states that “the odor of the burned shells is not pleasant.” 

Although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning &quot;nail&quot;, it is pointed out that nail or claw is an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx which antiquity often describes as a black stone. Coincidentally onycha is the Greek word which was chosen to replace the original Hebrew word which was shecheleth. One of the Hebrew words that &quot;shecheleth&quot; seems to be related to, שחלים, &quot;sh&#x27;chalim&quot;, refers to a large variety of plants. An ancient Ugaritic text lists onycha among types of vegetables, implying that onycha was a vegetable also. The Talmud specifically states that although onycha (&quot;shecheleth&quot;) is not from a tree, it does grow from the ground and that it is a plant (Kerithoth 6b). There is also some doubt that a mollusk would have been referred to as a &quot;sweet spice&quot; in Exodus 30, since it is the shell of a creature and not an aromatic or pungent vegetable substance. Condor writes “&quot;Shecheleth&quot;, Exod. xxx. 34; [is] rendered by the Septuagint, &quot;onycha&quot;, and by the Arabic version, ladana . . . The root of the Hebrew word means to drop or distil, and &quot;shecheleth&quot; would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.”
 James Strong writes &quot;the Syriac etymology of the word, namely, to run in drops, exude, distil, would lead to the idea of a resinous and odoriferous substance of the vegetable kingdom.&quot; Another writer says “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant, perhaps gum-ladanum. The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” &quot;Shecheleth&quot; identifies with the Syriac &quot;shehelta&quot; which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation.&quot;

According to Winifred Walker&#x27;s All the Plants of the Bible, &quot;shecheleth&quot; is a form of rock rose (also known as the &quot;Rose of Sharon&quot;), Cistus ladaniferus var. Cistus creticus, which produces a resin called labdanum. This sweet spicy ingredient has been used in perfumes and incense for thousands of years and grows profusely in the Middle East, specifically in Israel and Palestine. The rock rose is a bush, not a tree (the Talmud states that onycha comes from a ground plant and not a tree)
 which bears flowers widely noted for the markings upon its petals resembling human fingernails. Labdanum is the gray-black resin that exudes from the branches of the rock rose bush. Labdanum, after it matures, becomes black and is referred to as black amber or black balsam. Gill states that the word &quot;shecheleth is certainly related to the Hebrew word &quot;shechor&quot; (black),&quot; denoting the color of the shecheleth used in the ketoret formula. Onycha is a play on the word onyx which was a gem. The onyx most esteemed by the ancients was the black gem. The Hebrew word for onyx was shoham and “Braun traces shoham to the Arabic sachma,&#x27;blackness:&#x27; &#x27;Of such a color,&#x27; says he, &#x27;are the Arabian [onyxes], which have a black ground-color.&#x27; This agrees essentially with Charles William King&#x27;s remarks &#x27;The Arabian species,&#x27; he says, &#x27;were formed of black or blue strata.” The rock rose also has an inseparable identification with rocks because its existence depends upon its roots anchoring among them in areas where no other foliage is able to grow. After labdanum became hard it may have been put through another process causing it to emulate even more of the &quot;beautiful&quot; attributes of the onyx or to refine it, &quot;that it be pleasant.&quot; When used in sacred rites resins were often steeped in wine to, among other things, increase their fragrance.

A reference to onycha as an annual plant may be confusion with its annual yield. Rock rose usually produces labdanum annually, during the summer, to protect itself from the heat. A reference to onycha as a root may be due to the practice of boiling the twigs and roots for labdanum extraction or the use of cistus roots as a medicine. The root of the Cistus plant is a Jordanian traditional medicine. The root is still used today by the Arabs for bronchitis and also as a pectorial, demulcent, tonic, and anti-diabetic. Then again the possibility exists that while the onycha of Exodus 30 was labdanum, the identity of onycha may have been lost some time during or after the Babylonian captivity, with the operculum becoming identified as onycha during the time of the second Temple. However, as the original onycha of the book of Exodus, Abrahams says that, more than any other substance, &quot;labdanum fills the bill most convincingly.&quot;

The flowers of the rockrose bush are described as having petals with scarlet and black fingernail-shaped markings, thus its historically acclaimed connection with the Greek ονυξ (= onyx). Lynne writes, “Onycha . . . is a rockrose which produces a gum that is known as labdanum. The blossoms are about three inches across, white with at the base of each petal a blotch of brilliant scarlet-rose which deepens into black. In Greek onycha means &#x27;fingernail.&#x27; The blotch of color in each petal looks exactly like a brightly painted red fingernail.” Others proclaim that the very petals of this plant are shaped like finger nails. Again, onycha in Greek means “fingernail” or “claw.” Claws were used in ancient Egypt to collect labdanum. Pharaohs were pictured with this claw (a nekhakha) resting on their breasts. Claws, or rakes, were used to collect the labdanum from the cistus bushes and smaller claws, or combs, were used to collect labdamun from the beards of the wild goats. Removing and peeling the very sticky, adhesive labdanum from these very temperamental animals caused them to cry out, to “peel out by the concussion of sound,” or to “roar” out in protest. As mentioned above the original Hebrew word for onycha was שחלת, &quot;shecheleth&quot;, which comes from a root meaning &quot;to roar&quot; or “peeling off by concussion of sound.&quot; In Aramaic, the root SHCHL signifies “retrieve.” For thousands of years labdanum has been retrieved from the beards of goats and the wool of lambs by this method. The resin was peeled off of the goats’ beards, lambs’ wool, and from the lambadistrion (labdanum-gatherer). The Arabic word for peel is sahala. The Pharaoh’s beard was made up of goats’ hair which was held together and scented by labdanum. When the royal kingly Pharaoh spoke it was as the lion&#x27;s “roar,” the voice of god to the people. The Pharaoh was called the &quot;incarnation of Atum.&quot; Massy writes that, &quot;The lion was a zootype of Atum . . . He is called the lion-faced in the Ritual . . . He is addressed as a lion god, the god in lion form.&quot; Pharaohs were often depicted as part human and part lion wearing the false beard saturated with labdanum. This beard was inspired by the lion&#x27;s mane and was part of the various sphinx depicting the Pharaohs. A sphinx of Pharaoh Hatsheput displays a lion&#x27;s mane and the pharaoh&#x27;s manufactured beard. Strong defines the root word of &quot;shecheleth&quot; as &quot;to roar; a lion (from his characteristic roar).&quot; Labdanum was used not only as a perfume and adhesive for the Pharaohs beard but was also used by the Egyptian art of the apothecary in an incense known as kyphi which was rolled into small balls and burned upon coals of fire. However labdanum could also be an ingredient of a powdered incense. When aged it becomes more fragrant but it also becomes very brittle and hard. The fresh resin is a soft, sticky, and tar-like substance that is sweet, flowery, musky, and reminiscent of honey or ambergris with a hint of sweet leather. Mendes writes that at one point Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamliel, seems to indicate that one of the reasons wine was used was to make onycha become hard, which would seem to suggest that onycha was not a preexistingly hard mollusk shell, but that onycha was a soft resinous material such as is labdanum. Herodotus affirms that it was much used by the Arabians in perfumes. According to Pliny the Elder (23 - 79 CE), who mentions its fragrant smell, it was the extract of an herb called &quot; ladan.&quot; Labdanum was known as &quot;Arabic ladan.&quot;

According to the book of Exodus the Israelites were familiar with the ancient art of the apothecary (or perfumery) of the Egyptians from whom they had just been liberated. Lucas lists labdanum (along with frankincense, myrrh, galbanum, and storax) among the only materials most certain to have been used in ancient Egypt and that labdanum &quot;was abundant in the countries bordering the Mediterranean with which Egypt had intercourse.” He writes that in the Bible “ it is stated that certain merchants carried ladanum into Egypt from Gilead (Genesis, xxxvii:25, Revised Version) and that Jacob sent ladanum to Egypt as a present to his son Joseph (Genesis, xliii:II Revised Version).” Percy Newberry reports that the ancient Egyptians were acquainted with labdanum as early as the 1st century. Pliny states that the Ptolemies introduced labdanum into &#x27;the parts beyond Egypt.” It was known to the Greeks as early as the times of Herodotus (484-425 BCE) and Theophrastus (370 - 285 BCE). It was one of the ingredients in a remedy in the ancient Egyptian Materia Medica, and in an ancient Egyptian papyrus dated 1500 BCE it is used along with hippopotamus fat, as a cure for dandruff. Labdanum was “often made into incense cakes for temple offerings as well as used as a fixative in perfumes. Lucas records an “instance of labdanum having been found in connection with ancient Egypt [which] is a specimen of Coptic incense of the seventh century from Faras near Wadi Halfa.

Martin Luther, in co-operation with Bible expert and Greek scholar Philipp Melanchton, rejected the operculum theory in favor of onycha being a plant product. A commentary footnote in one of the older copies of the Authorized Version seems to agree saying, “The only hint about the onycha that we can find is in the Arabic version, where we meet with ladana, suggesting . . . gum-ladanum.” The Illustrated Dictionary of the Bible plainly defines onycha as the “gum resin obtained from . . . the rockrose, also known as labdanum.

Bochartus, a scholar of profound erudition possessing a thorough knowledge of the principal Oriental languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic, argued that onycha was labdanum. It is claimed “Bochartus proves, by many arguments, [onycha ] to be ladanum”
Abrahams writes that &quot;the Hebrew name &quot;shecheleth&quot; was translated as ladana, giving rise to labdanum.&quot; The renowned Jewish scholar and writer Saadya (Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon, 882-942), born in Upper Egypt (Fayum) and educated in Fustat (Old Cairo), translated the Bible into Arabic. Saadya, who was a theologian as well as the head Rabbi at the Sura Academy, was equally versed in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Arabic, and knew the people and customs of the whole Arabic region intimately. Saadya&#x27;s translation for Shecheleth was the Arabic &quot;Ladana,&quot; and ladana is our ladanum or labdanum. H.J. Abrahams states that &quot;I am sure that &quot;Shecheleth&quot; (onycha) is a plant product . . . After diligent reflection on all these diverse options, there is little doubt in my mind that onycha of Exodus 30:34 is labdanum. Saadya&#x27;s labdanum is not only ideally suited for use in incense, but it is also a product of the Jewish homeland.&quot;

==Lesser recognized contenders==

There are several lesser recognized contenders for the title &quot;Onycha&quot; which should also be mentioned here:

===Benzoin===

The internationally renowned Bible scholar Bochart stated, at one point in his research, that onycha was actually benzoin, a gum-resin from the Styrax species. H.J. Abrahams states that the use of benzoin in the Biblical incense is not inconceivable since Syro-Arabian tribes maintained extensive trade routes prior to Hellenism. Styrax Benzoin was available via import to the biblical lands during the Old Testament era. Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE indicates that different kinds of styrax resins were traded. Styrax benzoin was used by the ancient Egyptians in the art of perfumery and incense. The apothecary of Shemot (book of Exodus) would have been familiar with its aromatic uses. S. benzoin has a history steeped in antiquity and was once employed as an incense in Egypt. All the compounds identified in benzoin resin were detected in an archaeological organic residue from an Egyptian ceramic censer, thus proving that this resin was used as one of the components of the mixture of organic materials burned as incense in ancient Egypt. An ancient Egyptian perfume formula (1200 BCE) contained benzoin as one of its chief ingredients. The name &quot;benzoin&quot; is probably derived from Arabic lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي, &quot;Javan frankincense&quot;); compare the mid-eastern terms &quot;gum benjamin&quot; and &quot;benjoin&quot;. The word &#x27;Storax&#x27; is an alteration of the Late Latin styrax. In the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot; it is στόρακας or στόρακα. As pointed out earlier, the original word shecheleth was replaced with onycha by the Septuagint translation. Onycha in turn is derived from the onyx stone meaning &quot;fingernail&quot;. Conder writes that &quot;the root of the Hebrew word [shecheleth] means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” Another writer says that the Hebrew shecheleth identifies with the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear or distillation” and that “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant . . . The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” The book of Ecclesiasticus lists storax as one of the ingredients when alluding to the sacred incense of the biblical tabernacle. The Hindustanis use Benzoin to burn in their temples—a circumstance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that benzoin is part of the incense formula of Exodus. The infrequent mention of benzoin by name in antiquity is quite suspicious considering its importance in ancient recipes. It stands to reason it must have been known by another name not currently used today. References to it by name are conspicuously missing also from the Old Testament. Callcott writes “It has been suggested that Gum Benzoin, which is not mentioned by any other name in scripture, must be onycha. Its fracture has exactly the lustre required by the name. . . The gum is a secretion of the bark, and is of great efficacy in healing wounds. . . Such are the pretensions of the Benzoin to be looked upon as the true Onycha, which, from the text, as I have already said, must have been some fragrant vegetable gum in itself, of foreign production, and ranking with stacte, and myrrh, and galbanum . . . all which conditions are fulfilled by the Gum Benzoin.” Dioscorides and Galen describe two kinds of bdellium, the second of which is Benzoin, according to Hardouin and Sprengel. Pererra describes benzoin tears as &quot;flattened pieces, some of which are angular, and the larger of them . . . an inch in length&quot;. He says that &quot;externally, these pieces are shiny.&quot; This description most certainly fits well with the interpretation of &quot;onycha&quot; which means &quot;fingernail.&quot; He continues to say many of the pieces &quot;are of an amber or reddish-yellow colour&quot; and continues to describe parts of it as &quot;translucent or milky, and frequently striped.&quot; This is a good description of the appearance of various onyx stones, from which the name onycha is derived. He says that many tears of Styrax benzoin &quot;are translucent, or, in a few cases, almost transparent.&quot; One type of benzoin has &quot;numerous, white, small pieces . . . intermingled, which thereby give the broken surface a speckled appearance&quot; which he calls &quot;marbly.&quot; As mentioned above, although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning &quot;nail&quot; it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx. Onyx comes in a variety of colors the most prominent being either the black and veined striped gem or the pinkish translucent striped gem. One related Styrax is black and the benzoin discussed thus far seems to be of the pinkish, translucent sort. Steeping Styrax benzoin tears in wine can enhance its fragrance as well as its translucent qualities and &quot;shiny&quot; appearance, thus making it appear even more like the onyx gem. Rambam stated that soaking onycha in wine made it beautiful. Benzoin tears look very different from other resins and appear to be small stones rather than the vegetable product that it is.

Rashi writes that onycha was a root from the ground. Benzoin almonds do not resemble the resins they actually are but appear as a rough stony almonds. Not being native to Palestine they could easily have been mistaken as portions of a root since they do not seem to adequately resemble any other portion of a plant body. However it seems that the root of benzoin was also used. The ancient Greeks and Romans used benzoin root in a seasoning sauce for a meat boiled in sweet herbs. A Roman supper sometimes included shellfish prepared with pepper, cinnamon, and benzoin root. Benzoin root was also used in a recipe for seasoning goose liver. Benzoin root is still used today in incense recipes. Also the resin proper is procured near the root of the tree. Resin procured from the tree during the first three years is referred to as head benzoin. That which is obtained during the next 7 or 8 years is known as the belly benzoin. The third type is called foot benzoin, and is obtained by splitting the tree and scraping the wood of the trunk and roots. This latter source contains impurities. Rambam says that onycha was rubbed with bitter vetch to remove impurities. The Talmud also appears to indicate that onycha came from an annual plant. Benzoin gum is harvested annually, and not being native to Palestine it is possible confusion slipped in identifying its annual yield with its life span. Different Styrax trees are often misidentified or referred to as a &quot;bush.&quot; Onycha is said to have been soaked in wine to enhance its fragrance which was often done with resins used for incense.

The Hindustanis refer to benzoin as “lobanee” or “luban”. The Arabs refer to it as “luban” or “luban jawi”.

The book of Eccesiasticus (Sirach) 24:15 alludes to the sacred incense speaking of “a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.” The storax of antiquity was styrax. The writer refers to &quot;onyx&quot; as opposed to &quot;onycha&quot; while referencing styrax as part of the formula. Stacte may have been light myrrh treated with benzoin.
Onycha may have been labdanum. Since myrrh was often mixed with labdanum, throughout many centuries benzoin and labdanum may have inadvertently switched places in the formula. The possibility exists that the onycha of Exodus 30 was labdanum while the onycha of the second Temple was benzoin, with both ingredients still remaining in both formulas.

Winifred Walker writes that the onycha referred to in Exodus 30 is labdanum but later in the same book states that there was also another onycha, which he also equates as a component of the holy incense, which may have been derived from benzoin.

Labdanum and benzoin mixed

Labdanum and benzoin were often mixed together. The reproduced scent of ambergris is predominantly a mix of labdanum and benzoin. Ambergris was used by the ancient Egyptians as an incense. For centuries, benzoin has been mixed with labdanum, particularly in the Middle East, as an incense to scent homes, places of worship, and as an air purifier. This blend was used by the ancient Egyptians as an incense. Based on some of the latest research from the Edfu temple and a recent study
of ceramic dishes used in the preparation of kyphi, it appears that labdanum mixed with benzoin was an important part of the kyphi recipe. It was also part of the formula written about by Nostradamus who said it made “the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world” and that it acted as an air purifier against disease. It is possible that onycha was this mix of labdanum and Styrax benzoin. Styrax (referred to as storax in antiquity) is mentioned alongside of onycha in Eccesiasticus 24:15 when alluding to the sacred incense. Either onycha and styrax were originally mixed together or styrax was treated with labdanum or by the time of the first temple period a fifth ingredient was added to the ketoret. Stacte may have been light myrrh treated with benzoin.

Again, the possibility exists that the onycha of Exodus 30 was labdanum, while the onycha of the second Temple was benzoin or even the operculum.

===Bdellium===
&quot;Commiphora wightii&quot;, syn. &quot;C. mukul&quot;: Bdellium has been seriously considered as the ancient onycha. The tree, which grows in Arabia, produces a gum that was used in antiquity as an incense. It was one of the substances used in incense in ancient Egypt. As an incense it produces a sweet, spicy smell that some consider similar, although less bitter than, myrrh, combined with the scent of mushroom. The gum was often used as an adulterant of myrrh in the spice trade. The gum rolled into a small ball is known as hadrabolon. It is dry and shining having numerous white spots, like finger-nails in shape. Dioscorides said that bdellium was &quot;the tear of an Arabian tree.&quot; He describes bdellium as resembling a fingernail (which is the Greek meaning of onycha). Pliny says that bdellium &quot; is shining and dry, and covered with numerous white spots resembling the fingernails.&quot; This appears to be the same bdellium referred to by Damocritus, a medical writer, who was quoted by Saracenus in his Scholia in Dioscoridis, and the same bdellium referred to by Galen, as quoted by Salmasius in his Plinianae Exercitationes. Salmasius states that bdellium is the Arab Molochil (Mukul).

When used in sacred rites, bdellium was steeped in wine to increase its fragrance (Rambam says that shecheleth, or onycha, was steeped in wine to enhance its fragrance). The gum exudes from the cracks in the bark of the trunk near the root (Rashi refers to onycha, or shecheleth, as a kind of root). Bdellium is referred to in the early history of the Bible. Bdellium, like onyx, is the name both of an odoriferous gum and also of a gem or precious stone. &quot;And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.&quot; (Gen 2:12)

===Gum tragacanth===
After gum tragacanth is harvested, it takes on the appearance of grotesque &quot;fingernails.&quot; It had been used for thousands of years as an ingredient in incense, and has been seriously considered as a likely candidate for onycha.

===Cloves===
Cloves or &quot;zipporen&quot; in Hebrew, have been considered as a possibility. In contemporary Hebrew the word means &quot;nails&quot;.

===Amber===
It was the opinion of K.G. Jacob that shecheleth was amber.

===Cuttlefish bone===
Cuttlefish bone looks like large fingernails and can also be used in incense.

===Spikenard===
Spikenard is a well known aromatic herb that has been suggested in this context.

<doc id="1109754" wikidata="Q1964701" url="?curid=1109754" title="SGI O2">
<text>The O2 is an entry-level Unix workstation introduced in 1996 by Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) to replace their earlier Indy series. Like the Indy, the O2 uses a single MIPS microprocessor and was intended to be used mainly for multimedia. Its larger counterpart is the SGI Octane. The O2 was SGI&#x27;s last attempt at a low-end workstation.

== Hardware ==

===System architecture===
Originally known as the &quot;Moosehead&quot; project, the O2 architecture features a proprietary high-bandwidth Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) to connect system components. A PCI bus is bridged onto the UMA with one slot available. It has a designer case and an internal modular construction. Two SCSI drives can be mounted on special caddies (one in the later R10000/R12000 models due to heat constraints) and an optional video capture / sound cassette mounted on the far left side.

===CPU===
The O2 came in two distinct CPU flavours: the low-end MIPS 180 to 350 MHz R5000- or RM7000-based units and the higher-end 150 to 400 MHz R10000- or R12000-based units. The 200 MHz R5000 CPUs with 1 MB L2-cache are generally noticeably faster than the 180 MHz R5000s with 512 KB cache. There is a hobbyist project that has successfully retrofitted a 600 MHz RM7xxx MIPS processor into the O2.

===Memory===
There are eight DIMM slots on the motherboard and memory, and all O2s are expandable to 1 GB using proprietary 239-pin SDRAM DIMMs. The Memory &amp; Rendering Engine (MRE) ASIC contains the memory controller. Memory is accessed via a 133 MHz 144-bit bus, of which 128 bits are for data and the remaining for ECC. This bus is interfaced by a set of buffers to the 66 MHz 256-bit memory system.

===I/O===

I/O functionality is provided by the IO Engine ASIC. The ASIC provides a 64-bit PCI bus, an ISA bus, two PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse, and a 10/100 Base-T Ethernet port. The PCI bus has one 64-bit slot, but the ISA bus is present solely for attaching a Super I/O chip to provide serial and parallel ports.

===Disks===
The O2 carries an UltraWide SCSI drive subsystem (Adaptec 7880). Older O2&#x27;s generally have 4x speed Toshiba CD-ROMs, but any Toshiba SCSI CD-ROM can be used (as well as from other manufacturers, the bezel replacement however is designed to fit Toshiba design and also IRIX cannot utilize CD-DA mode other than Toshiba). Later units have Toshiba DVD-ROMs. The R5000/RM7000 units have two available drive sleds for SCA UltraWide SCSI hard-disks. Because the R10000/R12000 CPU module has a much higher cooling-fan assembly, the R10000/R12000 units have room for only one drive-sled.

===Graphics===

The O2 used the CRM chipset specifically developed by SGI for the O2. It was developed to be a low-cost implementation of the OpenGL 1.1 architecture with ARB image extensions in both software and hardware. The chipset consists of the microprocessor, and the ICE, MRE and Display ASICs. All display list and vertex processing, as well as the control of the MRE ASIC is performed by the microprocessor. The ICE ASIC performs the packaging and unpacking of pixels as well as operations on pixel data. The MRE ASIC performs rasterization and texture mapping. Due to the unified memory architecture, the texture and framebuffer memory comes from main memory, resulting in a system that has a variable amount of each memory. The Display Engine generates analog video signals from framebuffer data fetched from the memory for display. 

===Operating systems===
Several operating systems support the O2:
*IRIX 6.3 or 6.5.x (native platform).
*Linux port is working, but some drivers are missing. Debian, Gentoo and T2 Linux have releases that work on the O2. 
* OpenBSD ran on the O2 starting from OpenBSD 3.7 until the discontinuation of the &quot;sgi&quot; port in OpenBSD 6.9.
* NetBSD has run on the O2 since NetBSD 2.0. It was the first open-source operating system to be ported to the O2. See the sgimips port page.

== Performance ==
The SGI O2 has an Imaging and Compression Engine (ICE) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for processing streaming media and still images. ICE operates at 66 MHz and contains a R3000-derived microprocessor serving as the scalar unit to which a 128-bit SIMD unit is attached using the MIPS coprocessor interface. ICE operates on eight 16-bit or sixteen 8-bit integers, but still provides a significant amount of computational power which enables the O2 to do video decoding and audio tasks that would require a much faster CPU if done without SIMD instructions. ICE only works with the IRIX operating system, as this is the only system that has drivers capable of taking advantage of this device.

The Unified Memory Architecture means that the O2 uses main memory for graphics textures, making texturing polygons and other graphics elements trivial. Instead of transferring textures over a bus to the graphics subsystem, the O2 passes a pointer to the texture in main memory which is then accessed by the graphics hardware. This makes using large textures easy, and even makes using streaming video as a texture possible.

Since the CPU performs many of geometry calculations, using a faster CPU will increase the speed of a geometry-limited application. The O2&#x27;s graphics is known to have slower rasterization speed than the Indigo2&#x27;s Maximum IMPACT graphics boards, though the Maximum IMPACT graphics is limited to 4 MB of texture memory, which can result in thrashing, whereas the O2 is limited only by available memory.

While CPU frequencies of 180 to 400 MHz seem low today, when the O2 was released in 1996, these speeds were on par with or above the current offerings for the x86 family of computers (cf. Intel&#x27;s Pentium and AMD&#x27;s K5).

== Uses ==
O2s were often used in the following fields:
* Imaging (especially medical)
* On-air TV graphics; the most widespread example of an O2 running TV graphics is the Weather Star XL computer for The Weather Channel
* Desktop workstation
* 3D modelling
* Analogue video post-production
* Defense industries

<text>Pandu () was the king of Kuru kingdom, with capital at Hastinapur in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He was the foster-father of the five Pandavas, who are the central characters of the epic.

Pandu was born pale, to Vichitravirya&#x27;s second wife, Ambalika. Pandu married Kunti and Madri. Following sage Kindama&#x27;s curse, his sons were born through the boons bestowed upon his wife Kunti by a number of deities, owing to his inability to bear children.

== Birth ==
When Vichitravirya died due to sickness, Bhishma was unable to ascend the throne because of his vow, and Bahlika&#x27;s line was unwilling to leave the Bahlika kingdom. There ensued a succession crisis in Hastinapura. Satyavati then invited her son Vyasa to impregnate the queens Ambika and Ambalika under the Niyoga practice. When Vyasa approached Ambalika, she was frightened by his scary appearance, and she had become pale in disgust; hence, her son was born pale. Thus, Pandu&#x27;s name means pale.

== Early life ==
Pandu along with his elder half-brother Dhritarashtra, was trained in the military arts by Bhishma and Kripacharya. Bhishma also taught Pandu in the fields of archery, politics, administration and religion. He was an excellent archer and Maharathi (warrior).

==Reign==
When it came time to nominate an heir, Vidura suggested that Pandu would be a better fit because he was not blind, unlike Dhritarashtra. Pandu became the successor to his kingdom and was crowned King of the Kuru kingdom, with capital at Hastinapura. Pandu conquered the territories of the Sindhu kingdom, Kashi, Anga, Trigarta kingdom, Kalinga, Magadha, etc., and thus re-established their supremacy over all the kings and increased the span of his empire.

== Marriage ==
Pandu was married to Kunti, the adoptive daughter of Kuntibhoja and the daughter of Shurasena (father of Vasudeva and grandfather of Krishna). His second wife was the princess of the Madra kingdom Madri. The marriage was proposed by Bhishma.

== Kindama&#x27;s curse ==

While hunting in a forest (looking from a distance, his vision partially obscured by plants and trees), Pandu saw a couple of deer in the process of coitus, and shot arrows at them; he later discovered that it was the sage Kindama and his wife who were making love in the form of deer. The dying sage placed a curse on Pandu, for not only had he killed them in the midst of lovemaking, but was not remorseful for his actions either. King Pandu argued with sage Kindama by misquoting sage Agastya&#x27;s ruling on the right of Kshatriyas&#x27; on hunting. Sage Kindama then cursed Pandu that were he to approach his wives with the intent of making love, he would die.

==Exile and Pandavas birth==
Upset and seeking to repent his deed, Pandu handed his kingdom to Dhritarashtra and left for exile in the forest. There, he started to lead the life of an ascetic with his wives.

===Birth of Pandu&#x27;s foster sons===
As a consequence of Kindama&#x27;s curse, Pandu became incapable of fathering any children. One day, Pandu was regaling the story of his birth and his wish of becoming a father to his first wife, Kunti. Kunti told him about the child-bearing mantra taught to her by the sage Durvasa. Pandu was overjoyed and told Kunti to use it to gain sons from suitable deities. He wanted his son to be righteous, and so he suggested Dharmaraja, the deity of death and righteousness. Kunti chanted her mantra and the deity granted her Yudhishthira. Later, Pandu expressed his desire for a powerful son. This time, Kunti invoked Vayu and Bhima was born. Pandu suggested Kunti to invoke Indra and a valiant son, Arjuna, was born. Pandu felt bad for Madri&#x27;s childlessness, and thus requested Kunti to share her mantra with her. Heeding his request, Kunti revealed her mantra once to Pandu&#x27;s younger wife. Madri invoked the Ashvin twins, and then gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva.

==Death==
One day, Pandu forgot about the curse and was suddenly filled with lust for Madri. Despite her pleas, he proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with her. After the act, his curse was fulfilled and he died. His body was cremated within the forest. Attributing her husband&#x27;s death to herself and swept by remorse, Madri took her own life after handing her children over to Kunti.

<doc id="1109761" wikidata="Q3354395" url="?curid=1109761" title="Swedish Social Democratic Youth League">
<text>The Swedish Social Democratic Youth League ( ; SSU) is a branch of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation in Sweden. The president has been Lisa Nåbo, since August 2021.

== Organization ==
The members form local clubs, but also belong to a municipal organisation (&quot;SSU-kommun&quot;) that are grouped together in regional organisations, in general following the county subdivisions, with the exceptions Stockholm County (two districts: Stockholm and Stockholms Län) and Västra Götaland County (five districts: Fyrbodal, Göteborg, Göteborgsområdet, Södra Älvsborg, Skaraborg).

Every second year, the national organisation holds a congress, adopting policy documents and electing a national Board. The national head office is situated in Södermalm in central Stockholm.

The Swedish Social Democratic Youth League belongs to the Young European Socialists (YES) and the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).

== History ==

=== Beginning ===
The Youth League was established in 1917 after the former Youth League, the Social Democratic Youth (SDUF), in the party split and formed the Swedish Social Democratic Left. That division was between the left and right factions that the social democracy across Europe went through. Per Albin Hansson led the fight against Zeth Höglund and the left wing that had won a majority at the SDUF Congress 1910 which voted to remove Hansson from the Board. The party&#x27;s leader and then President Hjalmar Branting supported Hansson, and the party&#x27;s board demanded a loyalty statement from the Youth League. The Youth League did not accept the statement&#x27;s wording requiring it to be &quot;...ready at all times to promote the party&#x27;s activities in full compliance with the party and its subdivisions decisions&quot;, because the organisation believed this was intended to silence opposition within the party. They called this ultimatum a &quot;Muzzled Charter&quot;. Then the split came, and the Youth League was forced to leave the party when a majority (136 votes against 42) at the Social Democratic Party Congress in 1917, voted in favour of Brant&#x27;s proposal and adopted a resolution which separated the then the Youth League from the Social Democratic Party SAP.

A new Youth League, the &quot;Swedish Social Democratic Youth League (SSU)&quot;, was formed at the Congress 27–28 October 1917 when 45 representatives met in Stockholm people&#x27;s houses. The participants included Per Albin Hansson, and Gustav Möller. One of the major points in Congress was the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage.

=== 1930s ===
SSU&#x27;s membership grew during the crisis years in the 1930s. Recognising that the members should be trained, it purchased a farm at Bommersvik in order to form a union school. During this period, SSU had over 100,000 members.

=== 1940s ===
By the 1940s, SSU became a national, fully functioning organization, and became closer to its parent organization. SSU criticized fascism during the 1940s, helped refugees and had lectures about fascist crimes. Willy Brandt lectured on the subject of Bommersvik.

=== 1950s ===
The big question for SSU during the 1950s was whether Sweden should have nuclear weapons. Bertil Löfberg argued in favour of atomic weapons, and was opposed by Oskar Lindkvist. The party made efforts to reform itself during this period, and tried to build a folkhemmet, a concept similar to that of the Welfare State. SSU began to campaign on ways to solve the housing crisis, and ideas about housing policies that led to &#x27;one million program&#x27; began to emerge.

=== 1960s ===
The presidents Ingvar Carlsson (1961–1967) and Bosse Ringholm (1967–1972) characterized this period as a time of success for Sweden, and social reforms could proceed rapidly. During this time, international issues became important, because SSU saw great injustice, especially abroad. It criticized foreign dictatorships and wars, including the Vietnam War. SSU felt obliged to fight for democratic socialism. Ringholm said about this time: &quot;An important task for SSU was to keep clean to the left and ensure that SSU is not ground into sects to the left of social democracy&quot;. The Federal Board did not agree on how to respond to the Vietnam War.

Everyone wanted to criticize the U.S., but Ingvar Carlsson and Ringholm wanted at the same time not be associated with the Communists in North Vietnam. Olof Palme believed that there was no risk that SSU would be misunderstood. The Board decided not to give any directives, but left it to each member / municipality / district to himself to decide whether it wanted to demonstrate against the Communists.

=== 1970s ===
After the left wing lost several congresses in 1972, they started organizing themselves as the Thursday Club. Thursday Club&#x27;s name came from the 40 left-wing delegates who met on a Thursday in Congress in 1972 and decided to maintain contact, including through political seminars, until the next congress. After a while, this group dispersed and a small group began to gather behind the newspaper offensive, which started in 1973. In 1976, it was revealed that secret Trotskyist activities had occurred within the SSU, but it would take four years before this could be proved. The proof finally came when two female members independently told the Board. Lars Engqvist, SSU&#x27;s President 1972–1978, campaigned in the SSU to try to get a majority vote for an exclusion of these people but the evidence was not strong enough. In the autumn of 1976, seven members were excluded.

At the Congress in 1978, enforced decisions about exclusion and a debate began on the offensive. The question of whether they were in the SSU shared federation. Lars Engqvist severely criticized an offensive in Congress. The board was shown to have a clear majority for exclusion. 1975–1977 was Jerry Smith, president of the IUSY, was the first Swede to the post and was elected to Congress in Brussels in Belgium. Nuclear energy was a major political issue in the 1970s, which would later lead to a referendum in 1980.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, it was clear that the hidden organization existed and that it had about 100 members of the organization in ten departments, and three people who worked full-time for the organization. Chairman Jan Nygren (1978–1984) said: &quot;It was pure James Bond story. In one of the papers, I saw my own name and a report on a conversation with me. It was about SSU&#x27;s military service activities and how we would activate SSU: are in the military. Then I could understand mentally that it was not something Fuales&quot;. Some exclusions came as a result. Lars Engqvist and later Jan Nygren stressed that they were not trying to silence the opposition. The Congress in 1981, it was established that they had to clear out Trotskyists from SSU.

The left-wing was afraid that a purge would be used by the right-wing to remove those that the latter did not like. Over 100 members were excluded. The Congress in 1981 was also the basis for a compromise between the factions in SSU. Bo Bernhardsson won the vote on the Federal secretarial post. Chairman Jan Nygren, who was re-elected, and Bernhardsson came after some mutual distrust, cooperated and fighting in the Federation calmed down. This solution was repeated at the 2005 congress when the president and secretary were taken from a separate wing in order to calm conflicts in the organization.

The Mother Party decided to exclude the same on the party&#x27;s meeting in April 1982. SSU published a book, &#x27;Entrismen in Sweden &#x27;of the SSU&#x27; by Anders Lidström and Henry Ohlsson where it criticized the newspaper offensive. At the 1984 Congress, Anna Lindh was elected new president. Her time as chairman was marked by peace in League and she was SSU&#x27;s first female president. She received SSU to test new methods to change society. 1989 had the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) Congress on Bommersvik. Sven Eric Söder was elected president of the IUSY for the years 1989–1991.

=== 1990s ===
At the 1990 Congress, Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson was elected chairman. The internal fighting was not strong. The right-wing won an election in 1991, and SSU was in opposition. Between 1991 and 1993, SSU&#x27;s membership increased. I Sec (then Czechoslovakia) 1991 Roger Hallberg was elected president of the IUSY. The country has never had the presidency two terms of office. In 1994, SSU&#x27;s website was launched.

In 1995, the first Congress in Norrköping elected Niklas Nordstrom as chairman. Also that year, the current conflict between the factions emerged. The party&#x27;s right-wing wanted to distance itself from communism, for example, by leaving behind the symbols and words that can be related to Communism. This was largely because the Soviet Union had fallen and that abuses in the Eastern Bloc damaged the reputation of democratic socialism. The left-wing thought that it would be contrary to the traditions within the movement; it would be a betrayal of the foundations to move that way. This conflict persisted into the 2000s.

In 1996, the Federal distance from the Socialist newspaper (run by people active from the newspaper Offensive) and decided that membership of the association journal Socialist would be incompatible with membership in SSU. In 1997, at the Congress in Gothenburg, the conflict escalated. Two distinct factions emerged and voting for a Board became intense. The Election Committee could not find a compromise and left-wing vice-chairman Anders Ygeman was forced to leave the Board when the post was abolished.

At Congress in 1999 in Västerås, a left-wing candidate, Luciano Astudillo, from SSU district Skåne, almost became president. Differences between factions and a loaded Congress defeated Astudillo, and Mikael Damberg from Stockholm County SSU-district, won with votes 126-124. The European Union (EU) and European Monetary Union (EMU) were important issues. SSU decided, at an extraordinary congress in 1994, to campaign against Swedish EU membership, but did not run any campaign for a referendum the same year. The union gradually became more positive toward the EU and in 2001 the Congress almost considered approving Swedish EMU membership. For several years, Lisa Pellinge was Secretary-General of the IUSY.

=== 2000s ===
2000 was SSU hosted the International Union of Socialist Youth&#x27;s World camp in Malmö with approximately 2000 participants. The camp was the largest IUSY had organized to that date. At the 2001 Congress in Portsmouth, Damberg was re-elected, as no other candidate stood. This was a very clear signal against right-wing governance and showed the conflict seriously. What the left-wing most criticized was that programs replaced the &#x27;democratic socialism&#x27; with &#x27;social democracy&#x27; which was thought an ideological formulation when it seemed clear that SSU was socialist. The right-wing had a large majority in Congress and had a two-thirds majority on the Board. The EMU was again an emotive issue.

SU in 2002 launched its website. On 21 January 2002, party member Fadime Sahindal was murdered by her father in an honor killing. She campaigned for equality and for the rights of young women with foreign backgrounds. In 2003, SSU began a memorial fund in her memory.

In 2003, the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth Congress was held in the Bommersvik. SSU won a battle against French President Youth. Anders Lindberg was elected as the first Swedish president of the Young Socialists.

At the 2003 Congress in Karlstad, right-wing presidential candidate was Ardalan Shekarabi (SSU Uppland) and left-wing candidate Lina Afvander (SSU Jönköping). Afvander withdrew just before the president election on the morning on August 6 when she became the Nomination Committee&#x27;s proposal, and Shekarabi was elected unanimously. Sara Heelge-Vikmång (SSU Östergötland) was elected Secretary-General. Congress also decided, about one month before the referendum, to offer no opinion on the Swedish introduction of the Euro. In media, it has been claimed that the choice of Shekarabi may have been surrounded by some irregularities, which created some problems for the federation. It was alleged that money from the Development Activities was used to finance Shekarabis&#x27;s internal election campaign. This may have been one of the factors contributing to the factions seeking more consensus before Congress in 2005.

Shekarabis&#x27;s writings led to the resignation of Congress in 2005 and the establishment of a future commission that recommended the Congress to share power between the right and left wings. 2004 Anna Sjödin was elected vice-president of the International Union of Socialist Youth in Budapest. In 2004, the party campaigned to ban the fees for school food.

2005 revealed serious errors in SSU&#x27;s members register. A large number of people were in the register without having paid a membership fee. The police launched an investigation when they suspected benefit fraud because SSU received financial assistance based on its membership. Records were updated and to Congress, the Federal proposed that central members should exercise better control, so that districts could not systematic cheating. The police closed the investigation for benefit fraud because the crime could not be proved and SSU free from all. Also at the 2005 Congress, the Board tried to achieve organizational unity by allowing the two factions to share the board equally. The federal leadership was divided up so that the right-wing got the chair Anna Sjödin and left-wing union secretarial post Mattias Vepsä.

In 2006, Anna Sjödin was re-elected vice-president of the International Union of Socialist Youth Congress in Esbjerg. In December 2006, Sjödin resigned from the presidency after being sentenced for insult, violence against officials, violent resistance and an arbitrary act. She also was sentenced to pay 5,500 Swedish krona in damages. The post of president remained vacant until the next Congress. Secretary Mattias Vepsä was task to be SSU&#x27;s spokesperson in the meantime to Congress 2007. In January 2007 the Board&#x27;s new membership figures were announced; it had changed from 20,500 to 4,300. Measures were introduced to prevent cheating, which led to the fall in membership by over two thirds over one and a half years, and SSU was no longer the country&#x27;s largest political youth league. In May 2007, it published the candidates to Congress in August.

Mattias Vepsä was the only candidate for a federal secretary. Jytte Guteland from the Stockholm County SSU-district and considered right-wing was nominated for the office of Federal. Several right-district support, however, Laila Naraghi from SSU Kalmar Län. There was discontent in parts of the right-wing because the Stockholm County SSU-district and Jytte Guteland&#x27;s other support district had handled the Inter-democracy poorly. In the spring, it was decided to hold a divided caucus to advocate Jytte Guteland to the Federal SSU. On August 8, at the Congress, Guteland was elected as chairman with 131 votes against 115 for Laila Naraghi.

=== 2010s ===
Gabriel Wikström was elected president in 2011. In October 2014 he became the first serving president of SSU to become appointed a cabinet minister when he got the position of Minister for Public Health, Healthcare and Sports in the Löfven cabinet. Ellinor Eriksson, who served as secretary general, then became acting president of SSU. In August 2015 SSU held its 38th national congress in Västerås. The congress elected Philip Botström as the new president of SSU and Andrea Törnestam as secretary general. The new leadership is elected on a two-year mandate. Botström and Törnestam were elected two more times at the 39th national congress in Älvsjö and 40th national congress in Karlstad.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2021 Philp Botström announced that he was stepping down as president at the next national congress. In July candidates started appearing for the leadership. Two people, Lisa Nåbo and Amalia Rud Pedersen ran for the position of president. Diyar Cicek and Isak Öhrlund ran for the position of secretary general. During the 41st national congress (and the first digital national congress) Lisa Nåbo defeated Amalia Rud Pedersen, who was the Nomination Committee&#x27;s proposal, with two votes, winning by 114-112. Diyar Cicek was elected secretary general. The election process of the new leadership has been described as the most open in the whole of SSUs history.

<text>USS &quot;Crevalle&quot; (SS/AGSS-291), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the crevalle, the yellow mackerel, a food fish, found on both coasts of tropical America, and in the Atlantic as far north as Cape Cod.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Crevalle&quot; was launched 22 February 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Fisher; and commissioned 24 June 1943.

== First and second war patrols, October 1943 – February 1944 ==
&quot;Crevalle&quot; arrived at Brisbane, Australia, from New London 11 October 1943, and after replenishing there and at Darwin, put to sea 27 October on her first war patrol, in the Sulu and South China Seas. On 15 November she sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kyokko Maru&quot;, almost 7,000 tons. On Thursday 18 November 1943, off the entrance to Manila Bay, &quot;Crevalle&quot; torpedoed the , incorrectly reporting &quot;Akitsu Maru&quot; as sunk. &quot;Crevalle&quot; made two more attacks on merchant ships before returning to Fremantle, Australia, for refit 7 December.

Her second war patrol, in the South China Sea from 30 December 1943 to 15 February 1944, found her attacking a submerged Japanese submarine on 7 January, only to know the frustration of premature torpedo explosion. On 9 January she sunk a sampan with gunfire In a hazardous special mission, she laid mines off Saigon on 14 and 15 January, and on 26 January sent a Japanese freighter &quot;Busho Maru&quot; to the bottom. A surface action with a small patrol boat on 11 February sank the enemy craft, and on 15 February, &quot;Crevalle&quot; fired at several targets in a large convoy, prudently clearing the area before the results of her firing could be verified.

== Third and fourth war patrols, April – August 1944 ==
On 16 March 1944 while refitting at Fremantle, Commander F. D. Walker assumed command, and on 4 April, &quot;Crevalle&quot; sailed for the South China Sea. She sank a freighter &quot;Kashiwa Maru&quot; on 25 April, and the oiler, &quot;Nisshin Maru&quot; (16,801 tons) 6 May, and on 11 May surfaced off Negros Island in the Philippines on another daring special mission.

She rescued 40 refugees here, including 28 women and children, and 4 men who had survived the Bataan Death March and made their escape. She also took off the family of an American missionary, who having seen his family to safety, returned ashore at the last minute to continue his ministry among the guerrillas. Along with her passengers, &quot;Crevalle&quot; recovered a group of important documents (the Japanese &quot;Z plan&quot;), and transferred all she could spare in the way of supplies to the guerrillas. In May 1944, while returning with her passengers to Darwin, &quot;Crevalle&quot; was spotted by a Japanese convoy on the third day of the journey. With four working torpedoes Capt. Walker maneuvered to attack, but was severely depth-charged by a Japanese bomber, a special ordeal for the passengers. The periscopes and radar were knocked out. They were landed safely at Darwin 19 May, 8 days after leaving the Philippines. Most uniquely, one of the female passengers also gave birth to a healthy baby boy during the return trip. &quot;Crevalle&quot; sailed on to refit at Fremantle.

For her fourth war patrol, &quot;Crevalle&quot; returned to the South China Sea, as well as cruising off the northern Philippines, between 21 June and 9 August 1944. In company with three other submarines for most of this patrol, &quot;Crevalle&quot; joined in a 30-hour pursuit and attack on a convoy on 25 July and 26 July, damaging one freighter &quot;Tosan Maru&quot;, and sinking the freighter &quot;Aki Maru&quot; already crippled by one of her groups. Two days later, &quot;Crevalle&quot; sank another freighter &quot;Hakubasan Maru&quot;.

== Fifth war patrol, September 1944 ==
Refitted once more at Fremantle, &quot;Crevalle&quot; put to sea on her fifth war patrol 1 September 1944. Ten days later, she surfaced after a routine trim dive. A lookout, Bill Fritchen, was first through the hatch followed closely by the Officer of the Deck, Lt. Howard James Blind. Fifteen seconds later, the boat took a sharp down angle, and submerged with the upper and lower conning tower hatches open, washing the lookout overboard. The flow of water through the upper hatch, which was latched opened, prevented anyone in the conning tower from closing it. The lower hatch to the control was blocked by a piece of floor matting.

At the hatch was seen to close and lock. The ship continued diving to at an angle that reached 42 degrees down. With communications out, an alert machinist&#x27;s mate, Robert L. Yeager, saved the submarine by backing full without orders. The pump room, control room and conning tower flooded completely, and all electrical equipment was inoperative. Yeager received the Silver Star for his action.

Bringing the submarine under control, her men surfaced and were able to recover the lookout, but not Lt. Blind. It was later determined that the stern planes had jammed in the full dive position causing the sudden dive. With Fritchen having been washed off the bridge when the submarine dived, it was concluded that Blind had hung on the ship, and sacrificed his life in unlatching the upper conning tower hatch, saving the submarine. Blind posthumously received the Navy Cross for his action. Blind, a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, had married a woman in Australia only two weeks before his death. &quot;Crevalle&quot; made her way back to Fremantle 22 September.

== October 1944–February 1945==
&quot;Crevalle&quot; departed Fremantle to head for California. During her voyage, the United States Navy Armed Guard detachment aboard an American Liberty ship mistook her for a Japanese submarine and opened fire on her with a gun when &quot;Crevalle&quot; was in the Bass Strait south of Melbourne, Australia. &quot;Crevalle&quot; suffered no damage or casualties.. In California, she underwent an overhaul Mare Island Naval Shipyard, followed by training at Pearl Harbor. In the Pacific Ocean on 15 February 1945, the American Liberty ship — which reported her position as — mistook &quot;Crevalle&quot; for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her at a range of , firing eight rounds and claiming two hits. All rounds actually missed, and &quot;Crevalle&quot; — which reported her own position as — suffered no damage or casualties.

== Sixth and seventh war patrols, March – July 1945 ==
The submarine put to sea on her sixth war patrol from Pearl Harbor 13 March 1945 under the command of Captain Everett Hartwell Steinmetz. Cruising in the East China Sea, she took up a lifeguard station during air strikes preparing for the Okinawa invasion, then on 23 – 25 April, made a hazardous search for a minefield believed to be located near the southern entrance to the Tsushima Straits.

She returned to Guam to refit from 3 to 27 May, then sailed for her seventh war patrol in the northeast section of the Sea of Japan under the command of Captain Everett Hartwell Steinmetz. She sank a freighter a day on 9 June (&quot;Hokuto Maru&quot;), 10 June (&quot;Daiki Maru&quot;), and 11 June (&quot;Hakuzan Maru No. 5&quot;); 13 June (two small sailing vessels by gunfire) and on 22 June inflicted heavy damage on the escort ship . Returning to Pearl Harbor 5 July, she got underway once more on 11 August, but received word of the end of hostilities before entering her assigned patrol area. She called at Guam and Saipan before returning to Pearl Harbor 10 September, then on 13 September, cleared for New York City, arriving 5 October.

The captain of these patrols, Everett Hartwell Steinmetz, received a Navy Cross for each patrol.

== Post-war service ==
After a repair period, &quot;Crevalle&quot; reported at New London, her assigned home port, 27 March 1946. She cruised to the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands before being placed out of commission in reserve at New London 20 July 1946.

Recommissioned 6 September 1951, &quot;Crevalle&quot; took part in training, exercises, and fleet operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until 19 August 1955, when she was again placed out of commission in reserve at New London. Again recommissioned 11 April 1957, she resumed her East Coast and Caribbean operations through 1960.

&quot;Crevalle&quot; was reclassified an Auxiliary Research Submarine AGSS-291 in 1960. She was decommissioned, 9 March 1962. &quot;Crevalle&quot; was struck from the Naval Register, 15 April 1968, and sold for scrap, 17 March 1971.

All of &quot;Crevalle&quot; war patrols, save the interrupted fifth, were designated as &quot;successful&quot;, and the first four won her the Navy Unit Commendation for distinguished performance of duty as well as four battle stars. Her last two war patrols were recognized with one battle star awarded for the Okinawa operation. She is credited with having sunk a total of 51,814 tons of shipping, and shared in the credit for an additional 8,666 tons.

<text>The National Woodcutters Rally–Rally for Gabon (, RNB–RPG) is a political party in Gabon.

==History==
The party was established in 1990 as Movement for National Rectification–Woodcutters (&quot;Mouvement de redressement national–Bûcherons&quot;, MORENA–Bûcherons), a breakaway from the Movement for National Rectification. In the 1990 parliamentary elections it won 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the largest opposition party. In February 1991 it was renamed &quot;National Woodcutters Rally&quot; (RNB).

The RNB nominated Paul Mba Abessole as its candidate for the 1993 presidential elections; He finished second with 26.5% of the vote. Although it won a majority of the contested seats in the 1996 local elections, the party was reduced to seven seats in the 1996 parliamentary elections. However, the following year Mba Abessole was elected mayor of Libreville, where the RNB had a majority on the municipal council.

In 1998 the party split, with a faction led by Pierre-André Kombila leaving to form the National Woodcutters&#x27; Rally – Democratic. In the presidential elections later in the year, Mba Abessole finished third with 13% of the vote and Kombila fourth with 1.5%.

In 2000 the party adopted the name &quot;Rally for Gabon&quot;, but was referred to as National Woodcutters Rally–Rally for Gabon. In the 2001 parliamentary elections the party gained a seat, giving it a total of eight.

The RNB–RPG did not nominate a candidate for the 2005 presidential elections, and contested the 2006 parliamentary elections as part of the pro-PDG bloc, retaining its eight seats. Although Mba Abessole was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2009 presidential elections, he later withdrew in favour of independent candidate André Mba Obame. The party was reduced to three seats in the 2011 parliamentary elections.

<doc id="1109773" wikidata="Q4707269" url="?curid=1109773" title="Alan McCombes">
<text>Alan William McCombes (born 1955) has been a leading member of the Scottish Socialist Party for several years, and was the editor of the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot; until 2003. With Tommy Sheridan, he was also author of &quot;Imagine: A Socialist Vision for the 21st Century&quot;, described by Tony Benn as &quot;one of the very best books I have ever read on the subject of socialism&quot;.

==Political career==

===Militant tendency===
McCombes first became involved in socialist politics in the 1970s, as a member of the Militant group. Together with Tommy Sheridan he played a leading role in the anti-poll tax movement. His 1988 pamphlet, &quot;How To Beat The Poll Tax&quot;, written a year before the tax was introduced, set out the strategy of a Scotland-wide united mass non-payment campaign.
In 1992 McCombes was a leading figure in the persuading Militant in Scotland to break with Labour resulting in the creation of Scottish Militant Labour. Throughout the 1990s, he challenged the traditional &quot;British Road to Socialism&quot;, arguing for the left to champion the idea of an independent Scottish socialist republic. In 1995, he called for a Scottish Socialist Alliance to unite the left. This was established six months later, laying the basis for the emergence of the SSP.

In 1996, McCombes established the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot; as a new fortnightly paper of the left, which he edited until 2003. This later became the newspaper of the Scottish Socialist Party.

===Scottish Socialist Party===
McCombes held the position of policy co-ordinator for the SSP for a number of years. In this role, he encouraged a rethink of the educational approach within the party and the adoption of more Marxist styles of engagement, influenced in particular by Paulo Freire. He has also argued that the party should embrace more diffuse structures than the traditional models of socialist parties championing the introduction of issue-based networks in addition to the geographic branch structure. Alongside Tommy Sheridan, he co-wrote &quot;Imagine: A Socialist Vision for the 21st Century&quot;.

During the bombing of Afghanistan, McCombes travelled to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to report for the &quot;Scottish Socialist Voice&quot;.

McCombes co-ordinated the SSP&#x27;s electoral campaign for the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, which saw the return of 6 MSPs for the party.

He announced his candidacy for convenor of the SSP on 19 January 2005. At the party conference on 13 February, he won 154 votes from SSP delegates, losing by 98 to Colin Fox. He was a leading member of the ISM platform until its dissolution in 2006.

===Involvement in the Tommy Sheridan defamation trial===
As part of the Sheridan v News International defamation trial, he appeared at the Court of Session on 16 May 2006 following a demand by News International to hand over confidential internal SSP executive committee minutes. He refused. On 26 May 2006 he was jailed for 12 days and his home was raided by Messengers at Arms after he refused to comply with the order to hand over the documents. He was released on 29 May after a decision by the SSP national council to hand the minutes over to the court.

On 7 July 2006, McCombes gave evidence in the defamation proceedings launched by Tommy Sheridan against the News of the World stating that Sheridan had admitted to him that he had visited swingers clubs. His version of events was supported by ten other people who were present at the meeting and matched the minutes of the meeting presented in court, though these were disputed during the court case.

He declared himself a hostile witness, describing the case as a &quot;squalid little squabble&quot; but was ordered to answer questions by the judge. He said: &quot;I am here under the strongest possible protest. [...] Your client, I have to say, the &quot;News of the World&quot;, symbolises everything that as a socialist I have stood against my whole adult life. [...] It should have been settled by one of both parties before innocent people were dragged into this bizarre pantomime.&quot;

In August 2006, in the aftermath of the Sheridan defamation case, McCombes publicly released an all-members bulletin addressed to members of the SSP, entitled &quot;The Fight for the Truth&quot; in which he said Tommy Sheridan&#x27;s libel victory over the &quot;News of the World&quot; &quot;could set back the cause of socialism by years if not decades&quot; because of the divisions that had occurred within the party and went on to give his view of the events leading up to the trial. He also condemned Tommy Sheridan&#x27;s announcement to stand for election as convenor of the SSP and said that Tommy Sheridan&#x27;s support had been &quot;based on the more middle class and rural sections of the party&quot; and were &quot;united only by their hostility to the majority of the leadership&quot;.

In 2010 he was also a witness in HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan. During the trial it emerged that he was the author of an affidavit to the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; which detailed that the party had asked Sheridan to resign as convenor, citing &quot;certain information&quot; in the party&#x27;s possession. Contrary to prior speculation it emerged that the affidavit did not contain details of the party&#x27;s 9 November executive meeting.

In June 2011, he published &quot;Downfall&quot;, his account of the Sheridan affair.

==Environmental activity==
In the 2010s, McCombes moved to Perthshire to work for the John Muir Trust which works to defend wild land, enhance habitats and encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to connect with wild places. In 2014, he and Roz Paterson published &quot;Restless Land: A Radical Journey Through Scotland&#x27;s History&quot;.

<doc id="1109777" wikidata="Q598109" url="?curid=1109777" title="Contempt (film)">
<text>Contempt () is a 1963 French New Wave drama film written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard, based on Alberto Moravia’s 1954 novel &quot;Il disprezzo&quot;. It follows a playwright, Paul Javal, whose marriage begins to fall apart during the troubled production of a film adaptation of Homer’s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The film stars Brigitte Bardot, Michel Piccoli, Jack Palance, Fritz Lang, and Giorgia Moll.

==Plot==
Paul Javal, a young French playwright who has achieved commercial success in Rome, accepts an offer from Jerry Prokosch, a vulgar American producer, to rework the script for German director Fritz Lang&#x27;s screen adaptation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

Paul&#x27;s wife, Camille Javal, joins him on the first day of the project at Cinecittà. After initial discussions, Prokosch invites the crew to his villa and offers Camille a ride in his two-seat sports car. Camille looks to Paul to decline the offer, but he passively withdraws, opting to follow by taxi instead, leaving Camille alone with Prokosch. Paul does not catch up with them until 30 minutes later, explaining that he was delayed by a traffic accident. Camille grows uneasy, secretly doubting his honesty and suspecting that he is using her to strengthen his ties with Prokosch. Her misgivings deepen when she witnesses Paul groping Prokosch&#x27;s secretary, Francesca.

Back at their apartment, Paul and Camille discuss the subtle tension that has arisen between them in the first few hours of the project. Camille suddenly announces to her bewildered husband that she no longer loves him.

Hoping to rekindle Camille&#x27;s affection, Paul convinces her to accept Prokosch&#x27;s invitation to join them for filming in Capri. Prokosch and Lang are locked in a conflict over the correct interpretation of Homer&#x27;s work, a stalemate exacerbated by the difficulty of communication between the German director, the French screenwriter, and the American producer. Francesca acts as an interpreter, mediating all conversations. When Paul sides with Prokosch against Lang by suggesting that Odysseus left home because of his wife&#x27;s infidelity, Camille&#x27;s suspicions of her husband&#x27;s servility are confirmed. She deliberately allows Paul to find her in Prokosch&#x27;s embrace, and in the ensuing confrontation, she implies that her respect for him has turned to contempt because she believes he has bartered her to Prokosch. Paul denies this accusation, offering to sever his ties with the film and leave Capri, but Camille refuses to recant and departs for Rome with the producer.

After a car crash in which Camille and Prokosch are killed, Paul prepares to leave Capri and return to the theater. Lang, meanwhile, continues working on the film.

==Production==
Italian film producer Carlo Ponti approached Godard to discuss a possible collaboration; Godard suggested an adaptation of Moravia&#x27;s novel &quot;Il disprezzo&quot; (originally translated into English with the title &quot;A Ghost at Noon&quot;) in which he saw Kim Novak and Frank Sinatra as the leads; they refused. Ponti suggested Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, whom Godard refused. Anna Karina (by then Godard&#x27;s former wife) later revealed that the director had traveled to Rome to ask Monica Vitti if she would portray the female lead. However the Italian actress reportedly turned up an hour late, &quot;staring out the window like she wasn&#x27;t interested at all&quot;. Finally, Bardot was chosen because of the producer&#x27;s insistence that the profits might be increased by displaying her famously sensual body. This provided the film&#x27;s opening scene, filmed by Godard as a typical mockery of the cinema business with tame nudity. The scene was shot after Godard considered the film finished, at the insistence of the American co-producers. In the film, Godard cast himself as Lang&#x27;s assistant director, and characteristically has Lang expound many of Godard&#x27;s New Wave theories and opinions. Godard also employed the two &quot;forgotten&quot; New Wave filmmakers, Luc Moullet and Jacques Rozier, on the film. Bardot visibly reads a book about Fritz Lang that was written by Moullet, and Rozier made the documentary short about the making of the film &quot;Le Parti des Choses&quot;.

Godard admitted to changing the original novel, &quot;but with full permission&quot; of Moravia, the original writer. Among his changes were focusing the action to only a few days and changing the writer character from being &quot;silly and soft. I&#x27;ve made him more American—something like a Humphrey Bogart type.&quot;

Half the film&#x27;s budget went on Bardot&#x27;s fee.
===Filming===
&quot;Contempt&quot; was filmed in Italy where it is set, with location shooting at the Cinecittà studios in Rome and the Casa Malaparte on Capri island. In a sequence, the characters played by Piccoli and Bardot wander through their apartment alternately arguing and reconciling. Godard filmed the scene as an extended series of tracking shots, in natural light and in near real-time. The cinematographer Raoul Coutard also shot some of the other &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; films, including Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960). According to Jonathan Rosenbaum, Godard was also directly influenced by Jean-Daniel Pollet and Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;Méditerranée&quot;, released earlier the same year.

Godard admitted his tendency to get actors to improvise dialogue &quot;during the peak moment of creation&quot; often baffled them. &quot;They often feel useless,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet they bring me a lot... I need them, just as I need the pulse and colours of real settings for atmosphere and creation.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;luxuriant&quot; but wrote that Godard &quot;could put his talents to more intelligent and illuminating use&quot;; according to Crowther, who is unclear about the motivations of the main characters, &quot;Mr. Godard has attempted to make this film communicate a sense of the alienation of individuals in this complex modern world. And he has clearly directed to get a tempo that suggests irritation and ennui.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;Contempt&quot; &quot;is not one of the great Godard films, for reasons it makes clear. In a way, it’s about its own shortcomings. [...] It is interesting to see, and has moments of brilliance (the marital argument, the use of the villa steps), but its real importance is as a failed experiment. &quot;Contempt&quot; taught Godard he could not make films like this, and so he included himself out, and went on to make the films he could make.&quot;

&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critic Colin MacCabe referred to &quot;Contempt&quot; as &quot;the greatest work of art produced in postwar Europe.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 8.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;This powerful work of essential cinema joins &#x27;meta&#x27; with &#x27;physique,&#x27; casting Brigitte Bardot and director Godard&#x27;s inspiration Fritz Lang.&quot;

==Legacy==
French journalist Antoine de Gaudemar made a one-hour documentary in 2009 about &quot;Contempt&quot;, &quot;Il était une fois... Le Mépris&quot; (&quot;A Film and Its Era: Contempt&quot;) using footage from Jacques Rozier&#x27;s earlier documentaries &quot;Paparazzi&quot; (1963), &quot;Le Parti des Choses&quot; (1964), and André S. Labarthe&#x27;s &quot;Le dinosaure et le bébé&quot; (1967).

In 2012, Godard&#x27;s film ranked 21st on critic&#x27;s poll and 44th on director&#x27;s poll in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 greatest films of all time list.

The extended apartment sequence that occurs in the film, where Paul and Camille&#x27;s marriage unravels, has been praised by critics and scholars. In February 2012, &quot;Interiors&quot;, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights how Jean-Luc Godard uses this constricted space to explore Paul and Camille&#x27;s declining relationship.

The song &quot;Theme de Camille&quot;, which was originally composed for &quot;Contempt&quot;, is used as a main theme in the 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot;.

A still from the film was used as the official poster for the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2018, the film ranked 60th on the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest foreign-language films, as voted on by 209 film critics from 43 countries.

<doc id="1109784" wikidata="Q2625015" url="?curid=1109784" title="Page Avenue">
<text>Page Avenue is the debut studio album by American rock band Story of the Year. Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann, who served as a talent scout for Maverick Records, began working on demos with the band, and eventually for their debut album. Sessions took place at Feldmann&#x27;s home studio, Foxy Studios in Marina del Rey, California; the group tracked three songs before guitarist Greg Haupt left in November 2002. Guitarist Philip Sneed was drafted in and sessions recommenced in early 2003. The album&#x27;s release through Maverick Records was pushed back several times to September 16, 2003.

The band toured as part of the Warped Tour before &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; was released as a radio single. In early 2004, the band supported Linkin Park on their US arena tour; they subsequently worked with Linkin Park&#x27;s Joe Hahn on a music video for &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;. The track was released as a single in April 2004, and the group embarked on a headlining US tour. A second stint on the Warped Tour followed, taking a month-long break, and headlining the Nintendo Fusion Tour. A music video was released for &quot;Sidewalks&quot;; the track was released as a single in October.

Critics drew comparisons between the group and Thrice, Finch, and the Used, the lattermost being another act that Feldmann had produced. &quot;Page Avenue&quot; peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in April 2004, then platinum in March 2021, serving as one of the first post-hardcore albums to achieve either status. &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot;, &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot; and &quot;Sidewalks&quot; all charted on the Alternative Songs chart, with the first two reaching the chart&#x27;s top 20. &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; also reached the top 75 in the UK. An acoustic version of the album was released in October 2013, which coincided with an anniversary tour.

==Background==
Prior to the formation of Story of the Year, its members had played in local bands as early as 1995: Dan Marsala and Ryan Phillips in 67 North, Phillips and Josh Wills in Means Well, and Phillips and Adam Russell in Locash. With Marsala on drums and Phillips on guitar, the pair formed Bigbluemonkey. Soon afterwards, John Taylor and Perry West joined the band on vocals and bass, respectively. After performing in St. Louis, Missouri, and touring the Midwest, the group released two EPs: &quot;Three Days Broken&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Truth in Separation&quot; in 1999. Following high school graduation, the members were able to focus on the band. Shortly afterwards, Taylor and West left the group resulting in Marsala shifting from drums to vocals. Wills and Russell joined the group on drums and bass, respectively.

Since Means Well, Wills had been a close friend of Marsala and Phillips, following Bigbluemonkey on road trips and acting as their drum technician. Prior to joining, Russell was originally a guitarist and had no experience on bass. In February 2002, they recruited guitarist Greg Haupt, formerly of Disturbing the Peace, and released the &quot;Story of the Year&quot; EP. In May, the band performed at a local radio festival, Pointfest. The group sneaked into Goldfinger&#x27;s tour bus while the band was playing and left copies of a home video that featured pranks akin to &quot;Jackass&quot; and a live show. In June, the group moved to Orange County, California, and built their own practice space. Two weeks later, they were contacted by Goldfinger&#x27;s manager John Reese, who informed them the band wanted to take them on tour.

Partway through the tour, Goldfinger frontman John Feldmann said that he wanted to produce their demos to try to attract a record deal. They did pre-production acoustically, and tracked demos of &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; and &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot; in the process. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Feldmann showed the home video to major label Maverick Records, for whom he acted as a talent scout. In September, the group changed their name to Story of the Year to avoid confusion with another band called Big Blues Monkey, and at the urging of Feldmann, who disliked the name. In October, the band signed to Maverick Records following a showcase. In the process, Reese became their manager.

==Writing and recording==
Prior to signing with Maverick, the group wanted to improve their song writing. As Marsala explains: &quot;[W]e had songs, but we knew we wanted new stuff and we wanted to like really get serious.&quot; After signing, the band began working on material for their debut album, writing for roughly a month at Feldmann&#x27;s house. Feldmann helped the group structure their songs better. Recording took place at Feldmann&#x27;s home studio, Foxy Studios in Marina del Rey, California. The studio space consisted of one bedroom, which featured drums. Feldmann had stapled egg crates and glued foam to the walls to give the room better sound. He acted as producer and engineer with additional engineering by Mark Blewett. In November 2002, the group tracked &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;, &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; and &quot;Razorblades&quot;, which were the only songs they had at the time. However, before they planned to return to the studio, Haupt left the group over creative and personal reasons. The band spent the following seven weeks writing more music and searching for a new guitarist. They heard that guitarist Philip Sneed was on uncertain terms with his band Maybe Today.

Sneed joined the group after flying out to California and practicing with the band. Accumulating 25–30 songs, the band returned to the studio in March or April 2003. They narrowed the choice of songs to ten after a week or two, and spent the following six weeks recording them. Sessions took place seven days a week, up to 15 hours per day. Feldmann informed Maverick that they should record in Hawaii. They subsequently recorded at Avex Studios in Waikiki, Hawaii, tracking strings for two songs. The group said they &quot;spent 6 days in the sun and like 7 hours actually working.&quot; During the recording of &quot;Falling Down&quot;, Wills was unable to play the song&#x27;s beat. Feldmann didn&#x27;t want to edit the drums to make it sound like a drum machine, so Marsala opted to play them instead. The track served as the end of the recording sessions, with Marsala playing all the instruments on it.

Feldmann mixed the recordings at Foxy Studios, while Joe Gastwirt mastered them at Ocean View Digital Mastering. Toby Morse of H2O, Ray Cappo of Shelter and Feldmann sang guest vocals on &quot;Falling Down&quot;. Feldmann also sang additional backings vocals on &quot;And the Hero Will Drown&quot;, &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot;, &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot; and &quot;Razorblades&quot;. Marsala later criticized Feldmann&#x27;s role, saying: &quot;Feldmann had originally changed our sound. All of his records have the same sort of sound, because he&#x27;s always using the same formulas on everything.&quot; Feldmann said the group, who were influenced by bands ranging from Pantera to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, wanted to sound heavier than the album&#x27;s ultimate sound. He intended for the album to be highly vocal-driven. Marsala wanted it to be a metal record. Feldmann said people would not connect with that sound the same way they would if the band focused on the melodies and vocals.

==Composition==
Musically, the album has been described as emo, post-hardcore, alternative rock, pop-punk and screamo. Alan Sculley of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; said the tracks were in &quot;a middle ground between the heavy rock&quot; style of the Deftones and the &quot;poppier side&quot; Story of the Year had developed prior to moving to California. The band drew comparisons to Thrice, Finch and the Used, an act that Feldmann also produced. Feldmann tried to separate the sound of Marsala, who was more of a trained singer, from the sound he had previously achieved for the Used frontman Bert McCracken, who had a unique voice. He added that the band&#x27;s riffs leaned to a more progressive sound than the Used, who were more chaotic. Sneed said that while recording in California, the album &quot;took on like a whole sentimental, missing-home type of vibe&quot; with most of the songs being about &quot;missing home and missing friends and memories&quot;. &quot;Page Avenue&quot; was named after a popular east-west freeway close to St. Louis, Missouri. Marsala said it &quot;reflects a bunch of dudes determined to get out of St. Louis and make our dreams happen and while we were doing that we realized how very important our home really was to us&quot;.

Marsala came up with the guitar riff for &quot;And the Hero Will Drown&quot; and proceeded to show Phillips, who immediately suggested jamming. As the band wrote the track, they knew it would work as an upbeat, in-your-face type of song. They wrote it with a live setting in mind; Marsala thought the track sounded like Refused. &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; was written in the group&#x27;s van while they were touring. Wills wrote the first verse of &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;, before jamming out the rest of it with the band. Working on the lyrics, Russell had Saves the Day and Glassjaw in mind; Sneed said the track was about ghosts. The initial version of &quot;In the Shadows&quot; sounded much different before the band entered the studio. The group did not like Feldmann&#x27;s suggestion they make the chorus more chilled-out compared to the heavy nature of the verses.

&quot;Swallow the Knife&quot; is about the band&#x27;s former guitarist; &quot;The Unheard Voice&quot; was initially intended for inclusion, but was dropped in favor of &quot;Swallow the Knife&quot; as the band felt the album did not have enough slow-tempo songs. Marsala said the title-track summarized the album and represented home. For &quot;Sidewalks&quot;, Sneed said the group wanted it to have a &quot;different attitude&quot; compared to the rest of the songs by incorporating strings and bongos. It was almost entirely written by Sneed; it talks about relationships and missing the simpler periods in life. Sneed wrote the main riff before showing it to the rest of the band, who liked it. When learning that they planned to add strings, Sneed wrote the rest of the song with strings in mind. &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; came about during a period where the band wrote several heavy songs in a row. &quot;Razorblades&quot; was one of the first tracks written by the group&#x27;s new lineup. &quot;Falling Down&quot; incorporates heavier punk rock sounds by the likes of Blindside. The CD&#x27;s hidden track consists of bloopers/outtakes from the recording sessions.

==Release and touring==

After recording, Story of the Year moved back to St. Louis and immediately started touring. On May 7, 2003, it was announced that their debut album was scheduled for release in early July. On May 16, the album&#x27;s track listing was revealed; the album&#x27;s release was pushed back to August 27. On June 13, the album&#x27;s title was announced: &quot;Page Avenue&quot;. On June 22, the album&#x27;s release was pushed back again, this time to mid-September. In July, the group appeared on the Warped Tour. Partway through, the group was moved to a bigger stage because of the large crowds they were drawing. On August 9, two songs from the album were posted online. &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; was released to radio on August 12. The group wanted to tour for a year before their label Maverick Records started pushing a single. They grew up in the 1990s when labels were focused on investing in development. Russell, citing the Red Hot Chili Peppers and their song &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; as an example, said the band was afraid of being labelled sell-outs due to a big single. However, label executives was unwavering in their decision to release &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot;.

In August and September, Story of the Year went on tour with Saosin and labelmates Stutterfly. Maverick Records released &quot;Page Avenue&quot; on September 16. The cover was created by Lawrence Azerrad, Maverick&#x27;s in-house artist. It features a satellite image taken by Space Imaging over downtown San Diego, California. Marsala said they argued with Maverick about it, asking them to change it to St. Louis. The label said they would but then admitted the cover had already been printed. The band was &quot;pretty pissed&quot;. Between October and December, the band supported Sugarcult on their headlining US tour. On November 21, the band appeared on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. In January and February 2004, the group supported Linkin Park on their US arena tour. During the tour, the band learned Joe Hahn of Linkin Park had directed their music videos, which they really liked. After talking to their management, the band befriended Hahn, who subsequently directed a music video for &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;. On February 19, 2004, the band appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

Around this time, Maverick Records was using BigChampagne. The company had a top 20 downloads section, based on data culled from peer-to-peer networks, which featured &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot;. However, the song was receiving less airplay on radio than other artists. Jeremy Welt, head of new media at Maverick Records, convinced radio stations in certain markets to play the band during prime-time listening hours, which helped increase sales. In April and May, the group went on a headlining US tour with support from Hazen Street, Letter Kills and Motion City Soundtrack. &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot; was released to radio on April 13; followed by a music video on April 28. The group performed on the Warped Tour again. When it ended the group took a month&#x27;s break. In September and October, the band headlined the 2004 edition of the Nintendo Fusion Tour, which also featured Lostprophets, My Chemical Romance, Letter Kills, Anberlin and Autopilot Off. &quot;Sidewalks&quot; was released to radio on October 5. Russell and Phillips co-directed the video for the song, which was based on its sound than its lyrics, produced by production company Villains.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
AllMusic reviewer Stephen Cramer singled out Marsala&#x27;s unwavering vocals as a highlight of the album. Dave Roberts of &quot;The AU Review&quot; viewed it as a bit over-produced, though it had credible teenage emotion. Cramer noted the band&#x27;s reoccurring &quot;flare for the dramatic&quot; on &quot;Page Avenue&quot;. He called it a decent, Dashboard Confessional-esque debut, with &quot;crunchy&quot; ballads showing the band can be both tasteful and fierce. &quot;The Nerve&quot; writer Adam Simpkins said Story of the Year &quot;takes the worst elements of Death by Stereo&quot;, merging them with lyrics that &quot;would make Dashboard Confessional wince&quot;.

Johan Wippsson of &quot;Melodic&quot; wrote that the band had made a refreshing take on punk, noting that they had the possibility to be as big as the Used. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; writer Sam Sutherland added to the Used point, mentioning that a few songs appear to be candidly taken from that band&#x27;s self-titled debut album. He cited &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; as a good example of what the rest of &quot;Page Avenue&quot; sounds like with its appealing hooks and melodies, combined with an acceptable amount of screaming vocals and octave parts to please people who are seeking more of a bite to their music. Cramer similarly highlighted the group&#x27;s &quot;steady and layered&quot; instrumental work.

Sutherland said the album was &quot;excellent&quot; overall, &quot;instantly listenable and catchy as hell&quot;. Despite being a decade old the record &quot;is as good as it ever was&quot;, according to Roberts. Wippsson added that it was an enjoyable record and that fans of this kind of music would be content. Simpkins, meanwhile, noted an influence from hardcore, &quot;but for some unknown reason they sabotage each song with pissy laments or a string-arrangement&quot;.

===Commercial performance and legacy===
&quot;Page Avenue&quot; peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It reached number one on the Heatseekers Albums chart. By January 2004, it had sold close to 150,000 copies. By April, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), one of the first of the post-hardcore genre to do so. As of February 2011, it had sold over 900,000 copies. &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; charted at number 12 on the Alternative Songs chart. It also charted in the UK at number 62. &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot; charted at number 10 on the Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Sidewalks&quot; charted at number 40 on the Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; said &quot;Page Avenue&quot; and &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; helped push screamo into the mainstream musical landscape. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; at number 79 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs.

In February 2011, the group performed &quot;Page Avenue&quot; in its entirety for a one-off hometown show. An acoustic re-make of the album was released in October 2013 to celebrate the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary. The band decided to do this instead of simply re-recording, remixing or remastering the original. Most of the album focused around piano and string arrangements, instead of acoustic guitars as Marsala felt the piano gave a more dramatic vibe that fit better with the songs. Following the release, the band performed on the Warped Tour. They also headlined the Scream It Like You Mean It tour in the US playing &quot;Page Avenue&quot; in its entirety. During this tour, a limited number of copies of the anniversary release were made available. In November 2017, the album was released on vinyl by SRC Vinyl.

<text>The Scottish Socialist Voice is a fortnightly political newspaper in Scotland, published by the Scottish Socialist Party.

==History==
Established in November 1996, the &quot;Voice&quot; started life as the newspaper of Scottish Militant Labour, before being handed over to the Scottish Socialist Party on its formation in 1998. Alan McCombes, the paper&#x27;s founding editor, continued to act as editor until 2003. For a short time afterwards it was edited by Kath Kyle, followed by Joanna Harvie, and it is currently edited by Ken Ferguson.

It was originally launched as a fortnightly publication, and moved to a weekly format in May 2001 at great financial cost, before returning to fortnightly production in 2007. In 2009, it changed from a broadsheet to a tabloid format. It is primarily distributed through subscription and street sales.

The aims of the &quot;Voice&quot;, as set out in its first issue, are: 
* To report the struggles of ordinary people against injustice, discrimination and exploitation.
* To expose corruption and hypocrisy in high places.
* To cover politics, culture and sport from a socialist standpoint. 
* To champion the cause of an independent socialist Scotland as part of a worldwide fightback against global capitalism.

In December 2004, the &quot;Voice&quot; celebrated its 200th issue. In November 2006, it celebrated its tenth anniversary.

==Forum events==

Since at least 2013, the &quot;Voice&quot; has hosted a number of cross-party discussion events called &quot;Forums&quot;. In December 2013, figures from the pro-independence left were invited to a Forum to discuss &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;, which was chaired by John Finnie and featured Jim Sillars, John McAllion, Isobel Lindsay, Prof Mike Danson, Maggie Chapman, and Colin Fox on its panel.

<doc id="1109795" wikidata="Q1785816" url="?curid=1109795" title="Congolese Party of Labour">
<text>The Congolese Party of Labour (, PCT) is the ruling party of the Republic of the Congo. Founded in 1969 by Marien Ngouabi, it was originally a pro-Soviet, Marxist–Leninist vanguard party which founded the People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo. It took a more moderate left-wing stance following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and adopted social democracy as its principal ideology in 2006. Denis Sassou Nguesso is the President of the PCT Central Committee, and Pierre Moussa is the Secretary-General of the PCT.

== One-party rule ==
The PCT was founded by President Marien Ngouabi on 29 December 1969, and was Congo-Brazzaville&#x27;s sole ruling party from its inception. From the outset, it was heavily dominated by military officers from the sparsely populated north of Congo-Brazzaville. Although the PCT regime was designed as a Soviet-style socialist one-party state, it was essentially a military regime with a strongly ethno-regional character. Members of the southern ethnic groups, who were far more numerous than northerners, were included in the power structure, but the top leaders were consistently northerners.

Ideologically, the party represented a spectrum of Marxist–Leninist views and suffered from internecine struggles in the 1970s, which sometimes turned violent. Some leaders on the left-wing of the party, such as Ange Diawara and Claude-Ernest Ndalla, favored a radical pro-Chinese position; they unsuccessfully attempted a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; against Ngouabi in February 1972. The right wing of the party, which was derided as having only a superficial commitment to Marxism–Leninism, was represented by Joachim Yhombi Opango; the 1972 plot was inspired by the left wing&#x27;s loathing for Yhombi Opango.

Ngouabi was assassinated under unclear circumstances in March 1977 and succeeded by Yhombi Opango, whose opponents in the PCT were angered by his rightist deviationism and perceived marginalization of the party, and they ousted him in a February 1979 technical coup, installing Denis Sassou Nguesso—another career officer from the north—in power. The elevation of Sassou Nguesso, who represented the PCT&#x27;s left-wing, marked a return to party orthodoxy. Sassou Nguesso was neither a radical leftist nor an ideologue; his policies were generally marked by pragmatism, and he sought warm relations with the West as well as the Eastern Bloc.

As Sassou Nguesso consolidated power, PCT factionalism was less pronounced during the 1980s, although internal power struggles continued. Jean-Pierre Thystère Tchicaya, a leftist ideologue who was one of the PCT&#x27;s top-ranking leaders, was accused of organizing a bomb plot and removed from the leadership at the 1984 party congress. A powerful faction in the party, led by François-Xavier Katali, favored a hard-line pro-Soviet position; Sassou Nguesso was able to marginalize the Katali faction at the 1984 congress. Katali was demoted to a minor government ministry, but suffered no further punishment; when he died of a heart attack in 1986, he was considered a national hero.

Serious unrest in 1990 resulted in the collapse of the PCT regime. Sassou Nguesso was forced to introduce multi-party politics in 1990 and then call a National Conference in 1991. The National Conference saw severe criticism of Sassou Nguesso and repudiated PCT rule; it set up a non-PCT transitional government and reduced Sassou Nguesso to figurehead status.

== Multi-party era ==
The PCT was in opposition from 1992 to 1997, during the presidency of Pascal Lissouba. Although Marxist–Leninist ideology was abandoned, the party remained loyal to Sassou Nguesso and it continued to be dominated by key figures from the one-party era. Sassou Nguesso ultimately returned to power in the June–October 1997 civil war.

Denis Sassou Nguesso, presidential candidate of both the PCT and the United Democratic Forces coalition, won the March 2002 presidential election with 89.4% of the vote; there were no serious opposition candidates. The PCT won 53 out of 137 seats in the National Assembly in the May–June 2002 parliamentary election; together with smaller, allied parties, it held a parliamentary majority.

At the party&#x27;s Fifth Extraordinary Congress in December 2006, Sassou-Nguesso was re-elected as President of the Central Committee of the PCT and Ambroise Noumazalaye was re-elected as Secretary-General of the PCT; the Central Committee elected at the 2006 congress included more than 500 members (there were previously less than 150 members), while the Political Bureau elected on the same occasion included more than 60 members and the Permanent Secretariat included 15 members. Social democracy was also adopted as the party&#x27;s new principal ideology.

The political landscape in Congo-Brazzaville has been highly fractured since the early 1990s. In an effort to consolidate support for Sassou Nguesso, an initiative to &quot;refound&quot; the PCT as a broader party was attempted in 2006. Although backed by Secretary-General Noumazalaye, the effort encountered firm opposition from PCT &quot;conservatives&quot;, led by Justin Lekoundzou, who wanted to preserve the PCT as a distinct party.

Noumazalaye died in November 2007, and Prime Minister Isidore Mvouba became Interim Secretary-General of the PCT.

In the parliamentary election held on 24 June and 5 August 2007, the PCT won 46 seats; although it was again the largest party, the fractionalization of the political landscape ensured that it fell well short of a parliamentary majority. The combined parties of the Presidential Majority supporting Sassou Nguesso won an overwhelming majority: 125 out of 137 seats. After the election, a large grouping of parties, including the PCT, was launched in December 2007: the Rally of the Presidential Majority (RMP). While the member parties of the RMP preserved their distinct identities, the grouping provided for some degree of consolidation and improved organization among Sassou Nguesso&#x27;s supporters. In the 2008 local elections, the RMP parties ran joint candidate lists.

At the PCT&#x27;s Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in Brazzaville in July 2011, Pierre Ngolo was elected as Secretary-General of the PCT. His election as Secretary-General was considered surprising. It had been widely expected that the post would go to a more prominent figure, but Sassou Nguesso chose Ngolo, reportedly viewing him as a skilled organizer and as relatively uncontroversial. He was reportedly viewed as a &quot;man of compromise&quot;: &quot;an open conservative, anxious to preserve the identity of the party, while understanding the need for change&quot;.

In the July–August 2012 parliamentary election, the PCT won a parliamentary majority for the first time in the multiparty era, obtaining 89 out of 139 seats. The party has since remained the largest in the National Assembly, increasing its share of seats both in the 2017 and 2022 parliamentary elections.

== Membership ==
The party had about 70,000 members in 1990; by 2005, it had about 250,000 members.

<text>The FV4030/4 Challenger 1 is a British main battle tank (MBT) used by the British Army from 1983 to 2001, when it was superseded by the Challenger 2. The majority of the Challenger 1 fleet was subsequently sold to Jordan where it remained in service with the Royal Jordanian Army until withdrawals were announced in 2018. Known locally as &quot;Al-Hussein&quot;, these vehicles received various Jordanian modifications before being replaced by French-made Leclerc tanks from the UAE and ex-Italian B1 Centauro 8x8 wheeled tank destroyers. The Jordanian Challenger 1 fleet had been retired by January 2023.

==History==

The Challenger design by the former Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE) near Chobham in Surrey originated in an Iranian order for an improved version of the Chieftain line of tanks in service around the world. These were the Chieftain Mk5(P)- FV4030/1, FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1 and 4030/3 Shir 2. With the fall of the Shah of Iran and the collapse of the UK MBT-80 project, the British Army became the customer and the tank was further developed by MVEE to meet Western European requirements. For a short time the tank was named &quot;Cheviot&quot; (the name of a hill range) before becoming &quot;Challenger&quot;, a name reused from the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank of World War II.

The most advanced aspect of the Challenger 1 design was its Chobham armour, which gave protection far superior to any monolithic Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA), then standard of western tank armour material. This armour was later adopted by other designs, including the American M1 Abrams. Additionally, the hydropneumatic suspension provided outstanding cross-country performance through the long suspension arm travel and controlled bump and rebound behaviour offered.

The Challenger was built by the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROF). The Challenger 1 entered service with the British Army in 1983 and production ceased in 1990 at a cost of around £2 million each. In 1986, ROF Leeds (and the Challenger production line) was acquired by Vickers Defence Systems (later Alvis Vickers).

The Ministry of Defence was keen to show off the capabilities of the Challenger 1 in the Canadian Army Trophy Competition (CAT &#x27;87), held at Grafenwöhr, West Germany, in June 1987. The best performing team in preparatory competitions had been the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, although its Challengers had not been fitted with Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight (TOGS), which would put them at a disadvantage. The Royal Hussars had a squadron fitted with TOGS; however, they had been training at BATUS in Canada with Chieftains, instead of training with Challenger and TOGS for CAT &#x27;87. Twenty-two new Challengers with TOGS were specially diverted from the production line for the competition, resulting in teething problems. At the competition itself, the Hussars were placed last in the league table. In a statement to the House of Commons on 14 July, Ian Stewart, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, said; &quot;I do not believe that the performance of tanks in the artificial circumstances of a competition, such as the recent Canadian Army Trophy, is a proper indication of their capability in war.&quot; Following poor results in 1985 with the Chieftain, and in 1987 with the Challenger, the British Army decided in December 1987 to withdraw indefinitely from the competition.

A requirement for a new MBT was later issued. Proposals put forward for the new specification included an improved Challenger from Vickers, the American M1 Abrams, the French Leclerc, and the German Leopard 2. The Vickers Defence Systems design, designated Challenger 2, was eventually selected. This tank is significantly more capable than its predecessor: based on the same basic MVEE-designed hull, it features a new turret based on the Vickers Private Venture Mk7 design and improved Chobham armour.

Withdrawals of the Challenger 1 from the British Army began in 1998 and it had been completely replaced by the Challenger 2 by 2001. The bulk of these vehicles were exported to Jordan with around 20 vehicles retained for testing, development, and museum display. There was also a Challenger Marksman SPAAG version, equipped with the Marksman turret.

===Use by Jordan===

In the 1980s, Jordan had been interested in purchasing the original Shir 1 design, and subsequently ordered 274 &quot;Khalid&quot; tanks. The success of &quot;Khalid&quot; maintained the Jordanian interest in British made tanks.

The replacement of Challenger 1 tanks in British service by the Challenger 2 coincided with the accession of Abdullah II as King of Jordan. The new king had strong links with Britain, having begun his military career, while a prince, as an officer cadet at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, serving for a year as a troop commander in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, a British armoured cavalry regiment, before returning to Jordan. As a member of the Royal Jordanian Army, he became a tank company commander. Abdullah had thought he would spend his life in the military, but on 24 January 1999, weeks before his father&#x27;s death, he replaced his uncle Hassan as heir apparent.

In March 1999, after Abdullah II had ascended to the throne, the British Government, in a show of support of Abdullah&#x27;s foreign policy, and in response to a request from the new king, announced an agreement to supply Jordan with up to 288 Challenger 1 tanks as they came out of British service. These tanks had an average in-service book value of £750,000 per unit, that would reduce to zero upon withdrawal. The tanks were therefore supplied to Jordan at no cost, with the Jordanian Government agreeing to cover any transfer costs arising. The deal also included 112 support vehicles. This first tranche of vehicles were supplied to Jordan over a three-year period from 1999 to 2002 and enabled the replacement of the Jordanian Centurion fleet (known locally as &quot;Tariq&quot;). In late 2002 a further 114 Challenger 1 MBTs and 19 training tanks were &#x27;gifted&#x27; to Jordan. These vehicles had an in-service book value of £385,000 per unit but were also supplied to Jordan for the cost of the logistics of transfer.

The 402 Jordanian Challenger 1 tanks received substantial local modifications and were known in Jordanian service as &quot;Al-Hussein&quot;. Plans to upgrade Jordanian Challengers with a locally designed unmanned turret called Falcon were unveiled in 2003 and prototypes were produced. However, the design never reached full production and by 2016 had been shelved. The Jordanian Challenger 1 fleet was retired by January 2023. being replaced by French-made Leclerc tanks from the UAE and ex-Italian B1 Centauro 8x8 wheeled tank destroyers.

The withdrawn Jordanian vehicles are now in storage. In light of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is speculation that these vehicles could be acquired from Jordan and refurbished for Ukrainian use.

==Operational service==

In 1990, in preparation for Operation Granby, the UK operation in the First Gulf War, 221 Challenger 1 tanks were deployed to Saudi Arabia.

This deployment originally consisted of the 7th Armoured Brigade, consisting of two armoured regiments, the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, both equipped with 57 of the latest Mark 3 version of the Challenger 1. They were modified for desert operations by a REME team and civilian contractors at the quayside in Al Jubayl, Saudi Arabia. This fit included additional Chobham Armour along the hull sides and explosive reactive armour (ERA) on the nose and front glacis plate. Modifications also included the provision of extra external fuel drums and a smoke generator.

There were major concerns about the reliability of the vehicle. Before the commencement of the Gulf War deployment only 22% of Challenger 1s were operational because of faults and lack of spares. In addition there were serious worries about how a tank designed to perform in temperate climates would stand the rigours of desert warfare.

On 22 November 1990, it was decided to add the 4th Armoured Brigade to the force, under the umbrella of 1st (UK) Armoured Division. The new brigade had a single Challenger regiment, 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars, equipped with 43 Challenger 1 tanks and reinforced by a squadron of the Life Guards. They were equipped with the Mark 2 version of the tank, which was upgraded by armouring the storage bins for the 120 mm charges as well as the additional armour fitted to the Mark 3.

During Operation Desert Shield it was decided that the 1st (UK) Armoured Division would be placed under the command of the US VII Corps. This corps would form the armoured fist of the Coalition forces, tasked with destroying the bulk of the Iraqi forces. The forces of VII Corps crossed the Saudi border into Iraq, and then crossed into Kuwait. The 1st (UK) Armoured Division was the easternmost unit in VII Corps&#x27; sector, its Challenger tanks forming the spearhead of the advance. The division advanced nearly 350 km within 97 hours, destroying the Iraqi 46th Mechanised Brigade, 52nd Armoured Brigade and elements of at least three infantry divisions belonging to the Iraqi 7th Corps in a series of battles and engagements. They captured or destroyed about 300 Iraqi tanks and a large number of armoured personnel carriers, trucks, reconnaissance vehicles, etc. Patrick Cordingley, the British commander of 7th Armoured Brigade, said later that the &quot;Challenger is a tank built for combat and not competitions.&quot;.

The main threat to the Challenger was deemed to be the Iraqi Republican Guard&#x27;s T-72M tanks; each British tank was provided with twelve L26A1 &quot;Jericho&quot; depleted uranium (DU) shells specifically for use against T-72Ms, but during the course of the Coalition&#x27;s ground campaign none were encountered as the division was withdrawn beforehand.

After the Gulf War, Challenger 1 tanks were also used by the British Army in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operation Joint Guardian, the NATO-led drive into Kosovo.

===Challenger 1 gunnery===

In action the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Thermal Observation and Gunnery System (TOGS) fitted to Challenger 1 proved to be decisive when engaging the enemy, allowing attacks to be made at night, in poor visibility and through smoke screens. During the First Gulf War, British Challengers destroyed roughly 300 Iraqi tanks without suffering a single loss in combat.

On 26 February 1991, a Challenger 1 under the command of Captain Tim Purbrick of the 17th/21st Lancers attached to the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, destroyed an Iraqi T-55 tank at a range of 3600 metres, followed soon after by a petrol tanker at a range of 4700 metres using L23A1 APFSDS &#x27;fin&#x27; rounds with tungsten–nickel–copper penetrators.

That same day, a tank of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards engaged and destroyed an Iraqi tank at a range of 5100 metres using a L26A1 APFSDS with a depleted uranium penetrator. This is believed to be the distance record for a successful tank-on-tank, direct fire, kinetic round engagement.

In spite of the Challenger 1&#x27;s gunnery performance in the Gulf War against Soviet tanks, its fire control system was perceived to be inferior to that of other Western tanks. It&#x27;s performance in the 1987 Canadian Army Trophy competition, which Polish-British tank historian Richard Ogorkiewicz characterized as &quot;dismal&quot;, prompted the MoD to initiate the Challenger 2 program.

== Versions and variants ==
*Challenger 1 Mk. 1 : initial production version, the majority were produced with empty TOGS barbettes for the conversion programme to retrofit the system. 109 tanks built between February 1983 and January 1985.
*Challenger 1 Mk. 2 : fitted with the Barr &amp; Stroud/Pilkington Optronics TOGS (Thermal Observation and Gunnery System) thermal sight. 155 tanks built between January 1985 and November 1986.
*Challenger 1 Mk. 2 ACB : Challenger Mk. 2 whose glass-reinforced plastic &quot;wet&quot; charge bins have been replaced by steel Armoured Charge Bins (ACB) as part of the Operation Granby. 
*Challenger 1 Mk. 3 : equipped with armoured charge bins and a number of hull modifications. 156 tanks built between December 1986 and June 1990.
*CTT : Challenger Training Tank (CTT), 17 purpose-built driver training tanks. The CTT was based on the Challenger 1 Mk. 3 chassis. The turret was replaced by an observation and control cabin made of cast steel.

=== Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle (CRARRV) ===
In 1985, the UK MoD ordered a derivative armoured recovery vehicle from Vickers Defence on the Challenger 1 hull. Eighty vehicles were delivered to the British between 1988 and 1993, with four more later delivered to Oman.

CRARRVs have subsequently been upgraded to use the updated Challenger 2 powertrain consisting of a CV12-5C/6C engine with TN54E transmission.

CRARRVs were first deployed in action to support Challenger 1 tanks in the lead up to the First Gulf War, Operation Granby in 1991. They were subsequently deployed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Operation Telic in 2003.

An unspecified number of CRARRVs are to be donated to Ukraine alongside a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks in 2023.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
====CRARRV====

<text>The Heliconiinae, commonly called heliconians or longwings, are a subfamily of the brush-footed butterflies (family Nymphalidae). They can be divided into 45–50 genera and were sometimes treated as a separate family Heliconiidae within the Papilionoidea. The colouration is predominantly reddish and black, and though of varying wing shape, the forewings are always elongated tipwards, hence the common name.

Most longwings are found in the Tropics, particularly in South America; only the Argynnini are quite diverse in the Holarctic. Especially tropical species feed on poisonous plants, characteristically Passifloraceae vines, as larvae, becoming poisonous themselves. The adult butterflies announce their acquired toxicity with strong aposematic colours, warning off would-be predators. There are several famous cases of Batesian and Müllerian mimicry both within this group and with other butterflies. Other commonly seen food plants are Fabaceae (which also contain several toxic species), and particularly among northerly species of Violaceae.

==Systematics==
Four or five tribes are generally recognized in the Heliconiinae. There have been numerous attempts to sort out the phylogenetic sequence and delimitation of these, but while the former has made good progress, the latter has hitherto only achieved limited results.

Several phylogenies (and corresponding taxonomic adjustments) have been proposed, but though looking reasonable each and every one of them is only weakly supported. Even cladistic analyses of the same type of data often yield contradicting results depending on the exact method of evaluation. Ultimately, the reason is that just a fraction of the evolutionary diversity of Heliconiinae has been sampled.

What appears fairly certain is that the Argynnini and Vagrantini are closer relatives than any other two tribes of Heliconiinae. The Acraeini and Heliconiini are probably more basal lineages, but the exact placement of each respective to the other tribes cannot be considered well resolved at all.
Some tribes are distributed among several continents, resulting in a confusing phylogeography pattern. But as it seems, the apparent contradictions between systematics and biogeography are due to the premature classifications based on insufficient taxon sampling. With studies becoming more and more comprehensive, the apparent anomalies seem to sort themselves out at least for the most part. For example, the confusing distribution pattern of &quot;Acraea&quot; in the wide circumscription is apparently simply due to the bulk of this morphologically conservative group warranting recognition as genus &quot;Telchinia&quot; – it stands to note that this group has on occasion been allied with &quot;Actinote&quot; rather than &quot;Acraea&quot;, and this indeed appears to be correct.

In addition, the genus &quot;Pardopsis&quot;, often placed in the Acraeini, does almost certainly not belong there; it is now tentatively placed in the Argynnini. The relationships of the genus &quot;Cethosia&quot; (sometimes treated as a tribe of its own) are even more mysterious, and it is likely that some other genera will eventually also be moved to a different tribe as they are studied in detail. Some, like the Argynnini &quot;Argynnis&quot;, &quot;Boloria&quot; and &quot;Issoria&quot;, might be overlumped and non-monophyletic and thus some genera presently usually considered junior synonyms of them might eventually be validated like &quot;Telchinia&quot;.

<text>Paul Felix Weingartner, Edler von Münzberg (2 June 1863 – 7 May 1942) was an Austrian conductor, composer and pianist.

==Life and career==
Weingartner was born in Zara, Dalmatia, Austrian Empire (now Zadar, Croatia), to Austrian parents. The family moved to Graz in 1868, and his father died later that year. He studied with Wilhelm Mayer (who published his own compositions under the pseudonym of W. A. Rémy and also taught Ferruccio Busoni). In 1881 he went to Leipzig to study philosophy, but soon devoted himself entirely to music, entering the Conservatory in 1883 and studying in Weimar as one of Franz Liszt&#x27;s last pupils. Liszt helped produce the world premiere of Weingartner&#x27;s opera &quot;Sakuntala&quot; in 1884 with the Weimar orchestra. According to Liszt biographer Alan Walker, however, the Weimar orchestra of the 1880s was far from its peak of a few decades earlier and the performance ended up poorly, with the orchestra going one way and the chorus another. Walker got this account from Weingartner&#x27;s autobiography, published in Zürich and Leipzig in 1928–1929. The same year, 1884, he assumed the directorship of the Königsberg Opera. From 1885 to 1887 he was Kapellmeister in Danzig, then in Hamburg until 1889, and in Mannheim until 1891. Starting that year, he was Kapellmeister of the Royal Opera and conductor of symphony concerts in Berlin. He eventually resigned from the opera post while continuing to conduct the symphony concerts, and then settled in Munich, where he incurred the enmity of pundits like Rudolf Louis and Ludwig Thuille.

In 1902, at the Mainz Festival, Weingartner conducted all nine Beethoven symphonies. From 1907 to 1910 he was the Director of the Vienna Hofoper, succeeding Gustav Mahler; he retained the conductorship of the Vienna Philharmonic until 1927. From 1912 he was again Kapellmeister in Hamburg, but resigned in 1914 and went to Darmstadt as general music director while also often conducting in the U.S. for the Boston Opera Company between 1912 and 1914. In 1919–20, he was chief conductor of the Vienna Volksoper. In 1920, he became a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest. From 1927 to 1934 he was music director of the Basel symphony orchestra. He made many outstanding Beethoven and Brahms symphony recordings in Vienna and London between the mid-1920s and his last recording session with the London Symphony, including Brahms Second Symphony to complete the historic Beethoven-Brahms symphony cycle he began in the 1920s (see below), on February 29, 1940. He gave his last concert in London that year and died in Winterthur, Switzerland two years later.

Weingartner was the first conductor to make commercial recordings of all nine Beethoven symphonies, and the second (to Leopold Stokowski in Philadelphia) to record all four Brahms symphonies. In 1935 he conducted the world premiere of Georges Bizet&#x27;s long-lost Symphony in C. His crisp classical conducting style contrasted with the romantic approach of many of his contemporaries such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, whose conducting is now considered &quot;subjective&quot; on the basis of tempo fluctuations not called for in the printed scores; while Weingartner was more like Arturo Toscanini in insisting on playing as written. His 1935 recording of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 9&quot;, for instance, sounds much more like Toscanini&#x27;s 1936, 1938, 1939 and 1952 renditions (only the last of which was recorded in a studio rather than at a concert) than Furtwängler&#x27;s far more expansive readings.

He taught conducting to students as eminent as Paul Sacher, Charles Houdret, Georg Tintner and Josef Krips. He experimented with films of himself conducting (such as in his only recorded performance of Weber&#x27;s overture to &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;) as a tool in &quot;orchestral training&quot;.

He was married five times, to Marie Juillerat (in 1891), Baroness Feodora von Dreifus (1903), mezzo-soprano Lucille Marcel (1912; died in 1921), actress Roxo Betty Kalisch (1922), and Carmen Studer (1931).

==Composer and editor==
Despite his lifelong career as a conductor, Weingartner regarded himself as equally, if not more importantly, a composer. Besides numerous operas, Weingartner wrote seven symphonies which have all been recorded, with his other orchestral music, by &quot;cpo - classic production osnabrück&quot;, in Osnabrück, Germany. A sinfonietta, violin concerto, cello concerto, orchestral works, at least five string quartets, quintets for strings and for piano with clarinet and other pieces including a great many Lieder for voice and piano, one of which, &quot;Liebesfeier&quot; (text: Lenau) achieved a status as his most famous short work, in effect a &quot;hit&quot;. Weingartner&#x27;s choice of verse for his songs mirrors that of his contemporary composers: Max Reger, Joseph Marx, Richard Trunk and Richard Strauss.

His musical style, notably very generous, indeed rather valuable in its rather Schubertian melodic interest, is of its time: an amalgam of late Romanticism and early Modernism, comparable with those of his contemporaries Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Franz Schreker and Alexander Zemlinsky. His idiom left some marks on Erich Wolfgang Korngold, whose precocious &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; is dedicated to Weingartner, who conducted its first performance. His Third Symphony was intended both as a message of love to Lucille Marcel and a reply to the many critical attacks on him in Vienna; the finale reaches a climax in a parody of the waltz from Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. Similarly, he managed to finish his Fifth Symphony in time for Roxo Betty&#x27;s birthday, a trend in romantic attachment which may attract at least passing notice, for he was thus a very dedicated bridegroom in his deployment of manuscript paper.

Weingartner edited, with Charles Malherbe, the complete works of Hector Berlioz (he once called Berlioz the &quot;creator of the modern orchestra&quot;) as well as the operas &quot;Joseph&quot; by Méhul and &quot;Oberon&quot; by Weber, and individual works of Gluck, Wagner and others. He also made orchestral versions of piano works such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata, Weber&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;, and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Variations chromatiques&quot;. Before Brian Newbould&#x27;s more recent work, in 1934, he made a performing version of Schubert&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 in E major, D. 729, that has received some performances and recordings; he also arranged works by a number of early Romantic masters for orchestral performance.

==Writings and interests==
Weingartner was early interested in the occult, astrology, and Eastern mysticism, which influenced his personal philosophy and his music to some extent. He was himself a prolific writer who published a poetical drama, &quot;Golgotha&quot;, in 1908. He wrote copiously on music drama, on conducting, on the symphony since Beethoven, on the symphonies of Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann as well as on art and esoteric subjects. Two collections of essays were &quot;Musikalische Walpurgisnacht&quot; (1907) and &quot;Akkorde&quot; (1912). He also published an autobiography, &quot;Lebenserinnerungen&quot; in 1923.

<doc id="1109810" wikidata="Q3326727" url="?curid=1109810" title="Mauritian Militant Movement">
<text>The Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM; ) is a left-wing socialist political party in Mauritius. The party was founded by a group of students in the late 1960s. The MMM advocates a fairer society, without discrimination on the basis of social class, race, community, caste, religion, gender or sexual orientation.

In the general election of 2024, the MMM became the second largest party in the National Assembly of Mauritius with 19 Members of Parliament.

==Structure==
The party is divided into twenty &quot;Regionales&quot;, one for each of the twenty National Assembly constituencies the main island is divided into. (A twenty-first constituency covers the island of Rodrigues; the MMM, like other mainland parties, typically does not contest elections there, although historically they had a &quot;Regionale&quot; organized there). The MMM is divided into branches, each of which has a minimum of ten members. Each branch sends two representatives to the local &quot;Regionale&quot;. Each &quot;Regionale&quot; has one representative on the party&#x27;s Central Committee (CC). The CC also includes one male and one female representative of the party&#x27;s Youth Wing. The CC elects a Political Bureau from among its own members. Ultimate power within the party consists of the Assembly of Delegates, consisting of members of all branches, which can make any decision with a simple majority by secret ballot.

===Women&#x27;s Wing===
Since its inception in 1969, the MMM has emphasized women&#x27;s rights, and claims to have been the first political party in the country to have done so. A Women&#x27;s Wing was officially organized in 1974, with the goal of ensuring consistent representation of women in the Central Committee and the Political Bureau. It also seeks to support female candidates for parliamentary elections. Its fourteen-member executive committee is elected at the same time as the party&#x27;s Central Committee. The party&#x27;s constitution allocates at least two positions on the Central Committee to women who are not Members of Parliament.

===Youth Wing===
The Youth Wing, officially Jeunesse Militante, formed in 1973, is open to all Mauritian citizens aged between fifteen and thirty. A Youth Wing member can be affiliated to a branch or &quot;Regionale,&quot; or can join the Youth Wing directly. Membership is free of charge.

The Youth Wing is led by eleven executive members. They are chosen, normally for one year, by secret ballot of sixty representatives, three from each of the twenty &quot;Regionales.&quot;

==History==
The MMM&#x27;s origins date back to 1968 when students&#x27; movements &quot;Club des Étudiants Mauriciens&quot; and &quot;Quatre-Bornes Students Association&quot; were formed by Veenoo Mootien and Robin Punchoo respectively. These two groups merged into &quot;Club des Étudiants&quot;, which met regularly at Tennyson College, Quatre Bornes. In September 1969 during street protests against Princess Alexandra&#x27;s visit, 12 of the student-activists (including Heeralall Bhugaloo, Paul Bérenger, and Sushil Khushiram) were arrested by local police. After their release from prison, and with the assistance of PMSD MP Hurry Parsad Sham (also known as Panchoo), the student movement established its first Executive Committee at Heeralall Bhugaloo&#x27;s Port Louis High School. The committee&#x27;s first elected members were Heeralall Bhugaloo, Dev Virahsawmy, Jooneed Jeeroobhurkhan, Tirat Ramkissoon, Sushil Khushiram, Ah Ken Wong, Robin Punchoo, and Paul Bérenger. Other notable members of the new party were Zeel Peerun, Fureed Muttur, Chafeekh Jeeroburkhan, Krishen Mati, Kriti Goburdhun, Allen Sew Kwan Kan, Vela Vengaroo, and Amédée Darga. The movement also modified its name to &quot;Mouvement Militant Mauricien&quot; in September 1969. 

===The early years===
The MMM won its first parliamentary seat in a by-election in Constituency No. 5 Triolet-Pamplemousses in September 1970, following the death of IFB Attorney-General Lall Jugnauth. Dev Virahsawmy (MMM) defeated Nundlall, the candidate jointly proposed by the governing Labour Party, the Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate (PMSD), and a smaller party (CAM) by over 5000 votes. Showkutally Soodhun assisted Dev Virahsawmy and the MMM during the 1970 by-elections.

The MMM experienced its first schism in 1972, when the party&#x27;s president Heeralall Bhugaloo left the party due to clashes over language and clothing preferences. Shortly afterwards Dev Virahsawmy left the party in 1973 to found the MMMSP.

=== The path to power: 1976–1982 ===
In 1976, in the first general election since independence, the MMM emerged as the largest single party, with 34 of the 70 National Assembly seats. The Labour Party, led by the incumbent Prime Minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, won 28 seats, and the PMSD, led by Sir Gaëtan Duval won 8. The MMM was only two seats short of a majority, but Ramgoolam remained in office by forming a coalition with the PMSD. The MMM formed a strong parliamentary opposition with Sir Anerood Jugnauth as Leader of the Opposition. Prior to the December 1976 elections Heeralall Bhugaloo defected from the MMM to join the Labour Party. For several years Heeralall Bhugaloo had been President of the MMM. Other members also followed his lead including Ramesh Fulena and Vijay Makhan.

The MMM won power in the municipalities of Port Louis, Beau Bassin/Rose Hill and Vacoas/Phoenix. The first MMM mayors were Kader Bhayat (Port Louis), Jean Claude de l&#x27;Estrac (Beau Bassin/Rose Hill) and D. Jhuboolall (Vacoas/Phoenix).

On 13 January 1977 Heeralall Bhugaloo resigned from his position of Minister of Education under the Labour-PMSD government which he had held since the December 1976 elections. This made way for Kher Jagatsingh who took on Bhugaloo&#x27;s ministerial seat.

In the following election in 1982, the MMM campaigned on a theme of change. Using the slogan, &quot;Enn nouvo simen pou enn nouno lavie&quot; , the MMM won 42 of the directly elected seats in its own right, with a further 18 seats going to the PSM and 2 to the Rodrigues People&#x27;s Organisation, both of which were electorally allied to the MMM. The MMM and its allies had thus made a unanimous sweep of the directly elected seats — an unprecedented feat. Jugnauth became Prime Minister, with Paul Bérenger as Minister of Finance.

===The 1983 schism and aftermath===

Disagreements within the MMM led to a schism on 22 March 1983, when Prime Minister Jugnauth rejected Bérenger&#x27;s demands for the executive powers of the Prime Minister to be transferred to the Cabinet as a collective body. The party sought to replace Jugnauth with Prem Nababsing, but he dissolved Parliament before it had a chance to vote on the No Confidence motion brought by his erstwhile colleagues. Leaving the MMM, he and his remaining parliamentary supporters founded the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). In the election that ensued, the Jugnauth&#x27;s MSM and two allied parties held power, with the MMM, now led by Bérenger, winning only 19 of the 60 directly elected seats, despite gaining 46.4 percent of the popular vote. The MMM was to remain in opposition for the rest of the decade; despite winning 47.3 percent of the popular vote in the 1987 election, it secured only 21 of the 60 directly elected seats.

===Since 1990===

Mauritian politics since the 1990s has been characterized by frequently shifting political alliances involving the MMM, the MSM, the Labour Party, and some smaller parties. The MMM formed an alliance with the MSM for the 1990 elections, campaigning for Mauritius to cut its ties with the British monarchy and become a republic. The coalition subsequently broke down, however, and in the 1995 elections, the MMM joined forces with the Labour Party. This alliance swept all 60 directly elected seats, with 35 seats going to Labour and 25 to the MMM. The Labour Party leader, Navin Ramgoolam became Prime Minister with Bérenger as his Deputy. In 1997, however, Ramgoolam dismissed all MMM ministers, including Bérenger, and formed a one-party Cabinet.

In the 2000 elections, the MMM again formed an alliance with the MSM, under an agreement that each party would contest an equal number of parliamentary seats; if successful, they would divide the Cabinet posts equally, and that Jugnauth, the MSM leader, would serve as prime minister for three years, after which he would resign, assume the largely ceremonial Presidency, and hand the Prime Minister&#x27;s office over to Bérenger. Accordingly, Bérenger succeeded Jugnauth as Prime Minister on 30 September 2003. He led the MMM/MSM alliance to defeat in the elections of 2005, however. The alliance subsequently broke up and the MMM contested the May 2010 elections against the MSM as part of the Alliance du Coeur with two smaller parties — the Union National of Ashock Jugnauth and Social Democrat Mauritian Mouvement (MMSD) of Eric Guimbeau. The Alliance du Coeur won only 18 of the 60 directly elected seats, as well as two indirectly elected seats.

By 2014, the deputy leader of the party resigned when the MMM had formed a new alliance with the Labour Party. In the general election held on 10 December that year, this alliance won only 16 of the 69 directly and indirectly elected seats. Of these, 12 were won by the MMM itself. In 2015, the future of the party was questioned after several members resigned from the party.

===Back in the Government: Third 60-0 victory===

The formation of the was announced on 9 October 2024 in preparation for the November 2024 Mauritian general election by Richard Duval, Navin Ramgoolam and Paul Bérenger of the New Democrats (ND), Labour Party (PTr) and Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) respectively, ahead of the official registration of the coalition which occurred on 11 October 2024. A fourth party, &quot;Rezistans ek Alternativ&quot; (REA) by Ashok Subron, later joined this coalition.

 won a landslide victory in the November 2024 Mauritian general election. The MMM won all the 19 seats it was attributed and witnessed the third 60-0 victory, following the Mauritian General Election of 1982 and 1995. It is also the 5th victory in which the MMM won, whereby the winning party has the ability to modify the constitution of Mauritius.

Following the victory, the MMM obtained 8 ministries and 3 junior ministries:. As of the 27th November 2024, thirdelected member of Constituency No.20 (Beau-Bassin/Petite-Riviere), was expelled from the MMM because of poor work ethics, following his disppointment of his non-nomination of as the Minister of Sports |url=https://defimedia.info/politique-paul-berenger-franco-quirin-nest-plus-dans-le-mmm |publisher=Defimedia |access-date=01 February 2025}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, leaving the MMM with 18 elected members.

<doc id="1109818" wikidata="Q1740656" url="?curid=1109818" title="Khojki script">
<text>Khojkī, Khojakī, or Khwājā Sindhī ( खोजकी ), is a script used formerly and almost exclusively by the Khoja community of parts of the Indian subcontinent, including Sindh, Gujarat, and Punjab. However, this script also had a further reach and was used by members of Ismaili communities from Burma to East and South Africa. The Khojki script is one of the earliest forms of written Sindhi. The name &quot;Khojki&quot; is likely derived from the Persian word &quot;khoja&quot;, which means &quot;master&quot;, or &quot;lord&quot;.

As a scholarly article from 2022 has demonstrated, referring to the script as &quot;Khojki&quot; is a relatively new phenomenon, coined by the Russian scholar Wladimir Ivanow. This neologism began to replace the original terms used by Ismailis such as Sindhi and (when necessary to distinguish it from other forms of Sindhi script) Khwajah Sindhi. By this, they did not necessarily mean the Sindhi language, but rather the script utilized by their community, known as the Khwajahs or Khojas. To avoid confusion, the British administrative bureaucracy added the term Khwajah, referring to the script as &quot;Khwajah Sindhi&quot; The Ismailis sometimes did the same to distinguish the script from the language, as well as from other scripts used in Sindh.

The Khwajah Ismaili community continued using the traditional term ‘Sindhi’ alongside the neologism ‘Khojki.’ However, many scholars writing in English and other Western languages dropped the traditional term ‘Sindhi’ was adopting the invented term ‘Khojki.’

The script was employed primarily to record Ismaili religious and devotional literature; most notably in the form of poetry called &quot;gināns&quot; (a term derived from the Sanskrit &quot;jnāna&quot; meaning contemplative knowledge). Khojkī belongs to a family of scripts classified as &quot;landā&quot; or ‘clipped’ alphabets primarily employed as commercial and mercantile scripts by various Hindu communities of Sind and Punjab. It is one of the two Landā scripts used for liturgy, the other being the Gurmukhī alphabet, which is associated with Sikhism.

==History and evolution of the script==

According to the Nizari Ismaili tradition Pīr Ṣadr al-Dīn, the 15th-century &quot;dā’ī&quot; (preacher), invented the Khojkī script.  While it is now firmly established through epigraphic evidence that the script predates the arrival of the &quot;dā’ī&quot; in the form of the Lohānākī or Lārī script, scholars argue that it is very likely that Pīr Ṣadr al-Dīn did in fact play a pivotal role in the evolution, refinement, and the more widespread use of the script. Dr. Ali Asani, a leading scholar of Ismaili literature and one of the very few academics to systematically study Khojkī manuscripts concludes: &quot;we may surmise that Khojkī is most likely a polished or more developed form of Lohānakī with the legendary Pīr Ṣadr al-Dīn perhaps having played a role in its evolution.&quot;

The early versions of this script were primarily used for trade and mercantilist documentation and by their nature were not well equipped to record literature. Several main issues included: a very limited vowel system, lack of separation between words, inconsistent orthography, together with redundant and ambiguous characters. However, it is important to note that despite the apparent deficiencies of the script this did not mean that there were not already widespread local literary traditions, but rather that they existed primarily in oral forms. Over time solutions to some of these major issues were introduced into the script, with one of the most significant being the development of medial vowel marks called &quot;lākanā.&quot; A colon-like form of punctuation was also introduced to distinguish between words. Although these developments came rather early and facilitated the recording of &quot;gināns,&quot; based on manuscript evidence, it can be inferred that the scrip was continuously evolving right up until the late 19th century. However, it was a common practice for old and deteriorating manuscripts to be respectfully destroyed upon being recopied, thus making tracing the evolution of the script across time a challenge. Apart from the unknown number of manuscripts in private collections, there are currently three institutional collections at the ITREB-Pakistan (Ismaili Tariqa and Religious Education Board) in Karachi, at the IIS (Institute of Ismaili Studies) in London, and at Harvard University.

In adapting to new printing technologies, the Khojkī script entered a new stage of its development in the early 20th century under the auspice of Lāljī Devrājī, who compiled, edited, and published a range of materials in Khojkī through his Khoja Sindhi Printing Press in Bombay. Despite these efforts to utilize various new printing technologies, Dr. Asani reflects that &quot;ironically, the introduction of printing may have also sounded the deathknell for the script.&quot; Several factors contributed to this decline. During the early 20th century, the &quot;publication of religious literature was centralized and brought under the control of community institutions.&quot; While on the one hand this larger institutional backing aided in more widespread availability and distribution of texts in Khojkī. On the other, &quot;regional variations were a serious problem&quot; because of the &quot;lack of uniformity in the script in different geographical areas.&quot; Additionally, efforts made by the Ismaili Imamate institution to standardize rituals and shift away from the more &quot;Indic&quot; elements that became part of religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of Khoja communities also played a significant role in the shift away from using the Khojkī script. Even though Khojkī is no longer a &quot;living script&quot; access to this corpus can provide unique insights into the ways in which the Ismaili tradition grew and adapted in this specific cultural context, as well as offering insights into how this community envisioned and constructed their own history and identity.

== Script and identity ==
As is explained by Michel Boivin, for the contemporary Khoja community, because the &quot;gināns&quot; are at the core of the Khoja religious heritage, &quot;they quickly became a crucial stake in the process of identity construction.&quot; Asani argues that &quot;in the Ismaili case the adoption of the Khojkī script, a ‘local’ script, was probably part of the attempt to make religious literature more accessible by recording it in a script with which the local population had the greatest familiarity.&quot; In reflecting upon the larger history of the script and the literary tradition Asani also posits several other reasons as to why Khojkī was adopted and continuously refined by the local Ismaili community:…by providing an exclusive means of written expression commonly shared by Ismailis living in the three regions (Sind, Punjab and Gujrat), was influential in the development of the cohesion and self-identity within a widely scattered and linguistically diverse religious community. No doubt the script facilitated the flow and the transmission of religious literature from one area to another. Use of the script may have also served to confine religious literature within the community—this precaution being necessary to avoid persecution from outsiders not in agreement with the community’s doctrines and practices. In this respect, Khojkī may have served the same purpose as the secret languages, such as the so-called &quot;Balabailān&quot; language, used by Muslim mystics to hide their more esoteric thoughts from the common people.

==Characters==

Traditionally, diphthong vowels were written as a combination of vowel forms, and there were multiple forms of writing some of them. This is also true of the virama. There are also contextual variants of consonant-vowel combinations for some vowels, as is found in the Modi script. For conjuncts, there are a few &#x27;inherent&#x27; conjuncts found in most Indic scripts, such as &quot;ksa, jna&quot;, and &quot;tra&quot;, and &quot;dra&quot; is also found in addition. Most consonants are written using the virama pattern, as is found in the Saurashtra script or in the Tamil script, but some are written with a reduced consonant form on the second consonant in the cluster, typically with ra and ya. Gemination is indicated with the Arabic shadda, while nasalization is indicated with an anusvara that is reminiscent of Devanagari in position but of Telugu, Kannada, or Malayalam in shape. The nukta is composed of three dots, similar to the three dots found in modifying historically Arabic letters in the Persian script, and it is added to certain letters to form Arabic sounds. They can sometimes be ambiguous, with the nukta over the same letter sometimes mapping to multiple Arabic letters, as in &quot;ja&quot; or as in &quot;sa&quot;. Punctuation exists for marking word boundaries using colon-like marks, section boundaries using a combination of colon-like marks and double danda-like marks, and other Latin punctuation is also present. Abbreviation marks are represented by a small circle to the side, as is found in Modi and in Goykanadi. Verse numbering is indicated by an overline and digits and number forms typically use those found throughout North India in the region. Some additional letters and forms have been found, are detailed in the Unicode Proposal, and are being researched.

Over time some of the characters represented different sounds, which makes it difficult to read certain texts with the historical phonological values as compared to those with the modern phonological values known to most modern readers of published Ismaili literature. This is particularly true of the implosives, aspirants, and normal forms of &quot;ba, da,&quot; and &quot;ja&quot;, which shifted to render the implosive letter as a normal letter phonologically, the normal letter as an aspirant letter phonologically, and rendered the aspirant letter unnecessary. The implosive for &quot;ja&quot; began to represent &quot;za&quot;.

==Unicode==

Khojki script was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

The Unicode block for Khojki is U+11200–U+1124F:

Number forms and unit marks used in Khojki documents are located in the Common Indic Number Forms Unicode block (U+A830–U+U+A83F):

<text>The Socialist Party of Senegal (, PS) is a political party in Senegal . It was the ruling party in Senegal from independence in 1960 until 2000. In 2000, the party&#x27;s candidate and previous incumbent president, Abdou Diof, was defeated by the leader of the Senegalese Democratic Party, Abdoulaye Wade. 

Ousmane Tanor Dieng has been the First Secretary of the Socialist Party of Senegal since 1996 and was the presidential candidate in 2007 and 2012. The best-known figure of the party was Léopold Sédar Senghor, the first president of Senegal. The Socialist Party of Senegal&#x27;s goal is to work on the implementation of democratic socialism into Senegal&#x27;s political atmosphere. The implementation of democratic socialism includes the establishment of an open, democratic, and humanitarian society while preserving African identity. Since 1976, the Socialist Party of Senegal is the official socialist party choice for the country.

The Socialist Party of Senegal is a full member of the Socialist International. As of 2018, there were about 1.2 million party members.

== Political history ==
The Socialist Party of Senegal was first created in 1958 right before Senegal gained independence. The Party was founded by Leopold Sedar Senghor and it was in power under him politically from 1960 to 1980. The Socialist Party of Senegal was initially known as the Senegalese Progressive Union (&quot;Union Progressiste Senegalaise&quot;, UPS). Senghor had founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948 and in 1958 it merged with another political party to become the UPS. The UPS became the ruling party of Senegal in 1960 once independence was gained. The UPS officially was known as the Socialist Party of Senegal starting in 1976.

When Senegal gained independence in 1960, Senghor was unanimously elected president to Senegal&#x27;s new republic system. He was elected president on 5 September 1960. He had served in the French Constituent Assembly since 1945, therefore he already had political experience when elected president. In the early 1960s, there was a personal and political rivalry between President Senghor and Prime Minister Mamadoua Dia. In 1962, there was a coup attempt. Dia accepted blame and was sent to prison as a result. A new constitution took effect in 1963 and Senegal&#x27;s parliamentary system became a centralized presidential system. In 1963, Senghor ran unopposed for president and consequently won. By 1966, Senegal was considered a one-party state. This occurred because Senghor was running unopposed as president and the economic stability of Senegal began to fade. Senegal relied heavily on peanut-farming and this source of economic stability was in decline. Single-party rule prevented an overwhelming economic crisis and ensured social stability in Senegal, which was appealing to people in the country. In the 1990s, Senegal&#x27;s status as a democracy was called into question because it seemed impossible to remove the Socialist Party of Senegal from office.

There was no legal political opposition to the Socialist Party of Senegal until 1974, which is when Abdoulaye Wade obtained legal permission from Senghor to create a new party. He created the Senegalese Democratic Party. Starting in 1978, Wade&#x27;s party began to start winning seats in the National Assembly. This was the beginning of Senegal moving from an essentially single-party system into a more competitive system. Leopold Sedar Senghor voluntarily resigned from position of president in 1980 and Abdou Diouf came into power as Senghor&#x27;s hand-picked successor. Senghor became the first African head of state to voluntarily retire.

In the 2000 presidential election, the Socialist Party of Senegal was defeated and was no longer the ruling party for the first time in 40 years. Abdou Diouf, the 19-year incumbent of the Socialist Party, was defeated by Abdoulaye Wade. The removal of Diouf from office by an election broke the political monopoly the Socialist Party had on Senegal and helped establish Senegal as one of the African countries with the most advanced democracies. Senegal became one of the first African countries to remove the head of government by voting instead of a coup or violent measures. Wade was the candidate from the Senegalese Democratic Party and had been the leader of the political opposition against the Socialist Party for about 25 years.

In the 2007 and 2012 presidential elections, Ousmane Tanor Dieng unsuccessfully ran. In 2007, the Socialist Party participated in a boycott of the June 2007 parliamentary elections and has not held seats in the National Assembly since. Since 2012 the party has run in the parliamentary elections as part of the United in Hope coalition, the coalition of the presidential majority in support of Macky Sall.

== Election results ==

=== Presidential elections ===
Senegal is a republic with a presidency. The president is elected every 7 years (previously every 5 years until 2001 and between 2007 and 2012) by the adult Senegalese population. The 2000 Senegalese presidential election ended 40 years of dominance by the Socialist Party of Senegal. The party&#x27;s candidate, incumbent president Abdou Diouf, was defeated by the leader of the Senegalese Democratic Party, Abdoulaye Wade, in a second round of voting. Diouf received the most votes, 41.3%, in the first round, but in the second round he received only 41.51% against Wade. Ousmane Tanor Dieng was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2007 Senegalese presidential election; he took third place with 13.56% of the vote. He was also the candidate in the 2012 Senegalese presidential election and lost again. In the 2019 Senegalese presidential election, the party did not field a candidate.
=== National Assembly elections ===
The parliament in Senegal is unicameral and is currently made up of the National Assembly, which has 165 seats (the number of seats have gradually increased over past elections). There has been periods (1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2012) where Senegal has also had a Senate, but it was abolished by a constitutional referendum in 2001 and then abolished a second time in 2012. Elections are held every 5 years.

The Socialist Party of Senegal has held seats in the National Assembly since it was created until 2007. The Socialist Party of Senegal also previously held Senegalese seats in the French National Assembly starting in 1951 and held 43 out of 50 seats in Senegal&#x27;s Territorial Assembly starting in 1952.

Since independence, in the 1963, 1968, and 1973 elections the Socialist Party had full control of the National Assembly. In 1973 they lost 18 out of 100 seats to the Senegalese Democratic Party. In the years after they increasingly lost more seats in the National Assembly. The Socialist Party of Senegal finally lost majority in the National Assembly in April 2001 when the Senegalese Democratic Party won 89 of the 120 seats. In the 2001 election, the party only won 17.4% of the popular vote and 10 out of 120 seats.

In June 2007, the Socialist Party of Senegal boycotted the parliamentary elections. They have not held seats in the National Assembly since then, holding zero seats in 2007, 2012, and 2017. Since 2012 the party has run in the parliamentary elections as part of the United in Hope coalition, the coalition of the presidential majority in support of Macky Sall.

<text>The Senegalese Socialist Party () was a political party in Senegal (at the time part of French West Africa). PSS was founded in July 1934 by Lamine Guèye, as a split from the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Guèye was the party president, Armand Angrand (former mayor of Dakar) general secretary and Maître Vidal, Charles Graziani and Amadou Assane Ndoye vice-presidents.

The first congress of PSS was held on June 30, 1935, and the second November 24 the same year.

PSS published &quot;Clartés&quot;.

In 1936, PSS joined the Popular Front. Ahead of the elections PSS formed its own combat groups, to protect their meetings.

In 1937, a joint list of SFIO and PSS won the municipal elections in Saint-Louis. Maître Vidal became mayor.

The congress of PSS held June 4–5, 1938, decided to merge the party with SFIO. Following that decision, a June 11–12 congress of the new federation of SFIO was held in Thiès.

<doc id="1109849" wikidata="Q826380" url="?curid=1109849" title="Bernard of Septimania">
<text>Bernard (or Bernat) of Septimania (795–844), son of William of Gellone and cousin of Charlemagne, was the Duke of Septimania and Count of Barcelona from 826 to 832 and again from 835 until his execution, and also Count of Carcassonne from 837. He was appointed to succeed the third Count of Barcelona, Rampon. During his career, Bernard was one of the closest counsellors of the Emperor Louis the Pious, a leading proponent of the war against the Moors, and was an opponent of the interests of the local Visigothic nobility in Iberia.

==Title==
Bernard was indisputably a count (&quot;comes&quot;) of Barcelona and several other counties over the course of his long career. He also appears in the chronicles with the title duke (&quot;dux&quot;), though the extent to which this was a military designation is obscure. He is sometimes retrospectively referred to by historians as a margrave (&quot;marchio&quot;). His name and title as they appear in several primary sources were:

*&quot;Bernhardus comes Barcinonensis&quot; (&quot;Bernard, Count of Barcelona&quot;)
*&quot;duce Bernhardo&quot; (&quot;Duke Bernard&quot;)
*&quot;præfatus Bernardus&quot; (&quot;Prefect Bernard&quot;)
*&quot;Bernhardum Barcenonensium ducem&quot; (&quot;Bernard, Duke of Barcelona&quot;)
*&quot;Bernardus comes marcæ Hispanicæ&quot; (&quot;Bernard, Count of the Hispanic March&quot;)
*&quot;Bernardo comiti Tolosano&quot; (&quot;Bernard, Count of Toulouse&quot;)

==Count of Barcelona==
Bernard is first attested in historical records as one of four sons in a document of his father&#x27;s dating to 14 December 804 concerning the foundation of the monastery of Gellone.

Bernard must have inherited land in the area around Toulouse, from which he expanded his power to become count around 826. He first attracted the attention of higher nobility by quelling the local revolt of a nobleman named Aisso, who was perhaps a Visigothic lieutenant of the deposed Bera, Count of Barcelona. The garrisons of the castles in the area, who had favored Bera, joined Aisso in a revolt against the new count. Only the castle of Roda de Ter, in the county of Ausona, resisted and was subsequently destroyed by Aisso. From his newly occupied territory, Aisso attacked the county of Cerdanya and the region of the Vallès. The young count Bernard requested and received some help from the Emperor, as well as that of some local &quot;hispani&quot; (probably Gothic noblemen). To counter these reinforcements, Aisso sent his brother to request help from Abd ar-Rahman II, Emir of Córdoba, the only potential ally powerful enough to threaten the Franks. Abd ar-Rahman sent the general Ubayd Allah Abu Marwan to Zaragoza in May 827, from whence he invaded the territory of Barcelona, reaching the city itself in the summer. He besieged it and ransacked its environs, but failed to take it.

When the Emperor learned of these raids, he ordered his second son, Pepin, then King of Aquitaine, and the counts Hugh of Tours and Matfrid of Orléans to recruit an army against the Muslims, but recruitment was slow. By the time the army arrived, Abu Marwan had already returned to Muslim territory, taking Aisso and his followers with him (late 827).

This reprieve, seen as a victory, greatly increased Bernard&#x27;s prestige. Though the ravaged county of Ausona, a dependency of Barcelona, remained depopulated into the mid-ninth century, its ruin was attributed to the late arrival of Hugh and Matfrid. Both counts were dispossessed of their counties at the Assembly of Aachen in 828. At that assembly, Orléans was granted to Odo and Bernard&#x27;s brother Gaucelm received the fiefs of Conflent and Razes. As Leibulf of Provence had died in the spring, his vast dominions—Narbonne, Béziers, Agde, Melgueil, Nîmes, and probably Uzès—were assigned to Bernard. From this wide collection of &quot;honores&quot; in Septimania, Bernard took the title &quot;Duke of Septimania&quot;. In another assembly, at Ingelheim in June, a reprisal raid into Cordoban territory was considered, but although an army was gathered in Thionville, it did not enter the lands controlled by Bernard as the risk of Muslim raiding seemed to have declined.

==Court career==
In August 829, the Emperor sent his son Lothair to Pavia to wear the Iron Crown. Louis summoned Bernard to replace his son at court, granting him the title of &quot;camerarius&quot; or Chamberlain and the custody of the young Charles, then just Duke of Alsace, Alemannia, and Rhaetia, but later destined to be king of West Francia. Bernard delegated the government of his counties to his brother Gaucelm, who thereupon took the title &quot;marchio&quot; or margrave.

After only a few months at court, Bernard had made many enemies. Indeed, he was the prime catalyst for the revolt of Lothair the following year. Thegan of Trier, in his &quot;Gesta Hludowici&quot;, recorded that Bernard was accused of having an illicit relationship with Empress Judith of Bavaria, but considered these rumours to be lies. Nevertheless, these rumours provoked a riot in the army gathered at Rennes to fight the Bretons in April 830. His life under threat, as the three elder children of Louis supported the opposition against him, Bernard abandoned the court and, according to the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot;, returned to Barcelona. His brother, Eribert, who had remained at court, was banished. Bernard was deprived of the county of Autun which he had sometime before been granted.

At an assembly in Nijmegen in October 830, the Emperor recovered his authority after a brief civil war with his sons. Subsequently, in another assembly at Aachen in February 831, he proceeded to divide the Empire, giving Gothia to Charles, although the division would not be effective until his death. Bernard attempted to regain favour with Judith and Charles, but they avoided renewing relations with him after his fall from grace. At the Assembly of Thionville in October 831, Bernard spoke personally with the Emperor, but could not regain his previous position at court. In response Bernard reversed his previous loyalties and sided with the Emperor&#x27;s enemies.

==Civil war of 831–832==
In November 831, Pepin of Aquitaine revolted against his father. While Berengar the Wise, Count of Toulouse, advised him against such a course of action, Bernard encouraged it. In early 832 Louis the Pious began the campaign against his rebellious son. Berengar, loyal to the Emperor, invaded Bernard&#x27;s &quot;honores&quot; and took Roussillon (with Vallespir) and probably also Razes and Conflent. By 2 February, Berengar was already in Elna.

Ultimately, the successive victories of the imperial forces compelled Pepin and Bernard to appear before the Emperor in October 832. Pepin was dispossessed of his kingdom and sent as prisoner to Trier, having ceded all his territories to his half-brother Charles. Bernard was accused of infidelity and dismissed from all his offices and dispossessed of all his &quot;honores&quot; in Septimania and Gothia, which were given to Berengar. His brother Gaucelm was probably also dispossessed, but for a time he remained in possession of the County of Empúries, ignoring his dismissal.

==Civil war of 833–834==
In 833, however, Lothair revolted. Pepin, with Bernard and Gaucelm, remained loyal to Louis this time. After defeating Lothair&#x27;s forces and returning the emperor to power on 1 March 834, Bernard requested the return of his &quot;honores&quot;, citing the loss of men he had sustained for the emperor&#x27;s cause. However, Berengar was still in legal possession. The Emperor hesitated over his decision, but in June 835 he summoned Bernard and Berengar to an Assembly in Cremieux, near Lyon, where he would deliver a verdict. Berengar died unexpectedly on the way and, freed of obstacles, the Emperor gave Septimania and its counties and Toulouse to Bernard. The only territories not returned were Empúries and Roussillon, which had already been granted to Sunyer I and Alaric, respectively, and Urgell and Cerdanya, which had been detached from Toulouse by the usurper Aznar I Galíndez. Sunifred, brother of Oliba I of Carcassonne, was assigned to expel him.

Bernard returned to his domain, where the Goth population that had supported Bera and then Berengar still opposed him. Ten complaints were presented against him at the Assembly of Quierzy-sur-Oise in September 838. From 841, he was often absent from his lands, participating in the struggles of the Empire, and the counties were administered by their respective viscounts.

==Reign of Charles the Bald==
Bernard avoided participating in the Battle of Fontenay-en-Puisaye (25 June 841), where Charles the Bald and Louis the German defeated their brother Lothair, who retreated to the south with his army. Bernard remained outside the battle awaiting its result, upon which he sent his son William to offer homage to Charles the Bald and to promise him that his father would obtain the submission of Pepin II, the rebellious son of Pepin, who was claiming to rule Aquitaine. It seems that Bernard had no intention of keeping this last promise.

During Charles the Bald&#x27;s campaign in Aquitaine (842), he decided to punish Bernard, dispossessing him of the county of Toulouse in favor of Acfred (July). Bernard, however, refused to accept the decision and revolted, openly allying himself to Pepin II and expelling Acfred from Toulouse (843). Charles responded by sending the &quot;dux&quot; Guerin of Provence, who in 842 directed the campaign in Aquitaine, against Septimania. Various other events—renewed Viking invasions and Breton raids—compelled an end to the internal civil struggles afflicting the Empire and, in August 843, the Treaty of Verdun was signed between the three brothers: Charles, Louis, and Lothair. Septimania and Gothia were left in the hands of Charles the Bald. The county of Uzès, where Bernard still possessed estates, was assigned to Lothair. Furthermore, the county of Autun, which had long been lost to Bernard, and to which his son had renewed a claim, was given to Guerin.

In 844 Charles the Bald returned to Aquitaine with the objective of forcing Pepin II to submit and conquering Toulouse. During the Battle of Toulouse of 844, Bernard of Septimania was captured, either by the royal forces during the assault on Toulouse or, according to French historian Pierre Andoque, the year before by Guerin in Uzès. Andoque maintains that in 844 he was merely brought before Charles during his campaign through Aquitaine. One way or the other, in May 844 Bernard was presented to Charles, who ordered his execution.

The following month, Pepin II and Bernard&#x27;s son William dealt a severe blow to Charles in the Angoumois on 14 June. Bernard&#x27;s &quot;honores&quot; were given to Sunifred, who had been tasked previously with subduing Aznar in Aragon.

Bernard married Dhuoda, perhaps daughter of Sancho I of Gascony, on 29 June 824 in Aachen. By her he had two sons, the aforementioned William and another named Bernard Plantapilosa.

<doc id="1109862" wikidata="Q741609" url="?curid=1109862" title="Chieftain (tank)">
<text>The FV4201 Chieftain was the main battle tank (MBT) of the United Kingdom from the 1960s into 1990s. When introduced, it was among the most heavily armed MBTs of the era, mounting a 120 mm Royal Ordnance L11 gun, the equal of the much larger specialist heavy tanks then in service. It also was among the most heavily armoured, with up to that was highly sloped to offer thickness along the line of sight.

A development of the Centurion, the Chieftain introduced the supine (reclining) driver position to British design allowing a heavily sloped hull with reduced height. A new powerpack and improved transmission gave it higher speed than the Centurion despite being heavier due to major upgrades to armour protection and the armament; this allowed it to replace both the Centurion MBT and Conqueror heavy tank while performing their roles effectively.

The multi-fuel engine proved to be the design&#x27;s primary drawback; it was said that the Chieftain was extremely effective if it broke down in a useful location. This led to a series of improved models with new armor, sensors, engines and suspension systems, and these saw sales export success. Among these was the Shir 2 version for Iran, which added Chobham armour, one of the first British uses of this armour. This order was cancelled due to the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

It was intended that the Chieftain would be replaced by a new design, the MBT-80. When tensions with the Warsaw Pact rose in 1980, Vickers offered a further updated version of the Shir 2 which became Challenger 1. This could be available years earlier and still met many of the MBT-80 design goals. Challenger deliveries began in 1983, but initially proved problematic and the Chieftain remained in front-line service until 1996 with the introduction of the Challenger 2.

==Development==

The Chieftain was an evolutionary development of the successful cruiser line of tanks that had emerged at the end of the Second World War. Its predecessor, the Centurion main battle tank (MBT), is widely considered to be one of the most successful of post-war MBT designs. However, the introduction of the Soviet IS-3 /IS-4 heavy tank along with Soviet T-54/T-55 led to the introduction of the Conqueror heavy tank armed with a gun. A single design combining the firepower of the Conqueror&#x27;s 120 mm gun with the mobility and general usefulness of the Centurion was seen as the ideal combination.
Starting in 1950, a series of Concept Research Studies were undertaken &quot;in the search for a design to succeed Centurion&quot;. These involved both a development of the existing Centurion Heavy Cruiser Tank design, as well as a variety of unconventional concepts such as small 1 &amp; 2 man tanks equipped with anti-tank missiles or auto-loading and liquid-propellant guns. in 1954 the decision was taken that &quot;the next UK tank should be an evolutionary one designed to carry an HV gun with a bagged charge ammunition system&quot;.

Leyland, who had been involved in the Centurion tank, had built their own prototypes of a new tank design in 1956. Several aspects of the design were trialled by the production of the FV4202 &quot;40-ton Centurion&quot; with a reclined driver position and mantletless gun mounting. In effect, the FV4202 was a shorter Centurion chassis with a prototype of what would become the Chieftain turret, but armed with the 20pdr gun.

This work led to a War Office specification for a new tank. The General Staff specification drew on the experience of Centurion tanks in the Korean War as well as that of the Conqueror tank. The tank was expected to be able to engage the enemy at long range, from defensive positions, and be proof against medium artillery. To this end, the gun was to have a greater angle of depression than the 8 degrees of Conqueror and would be equipped with better frontal armour. The tank was expected to achieve a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute in the first minute and six per minute for the following four.

The first few prototypes were provided for troop trials from 1959 which identified a number of changes. Improvements to address engine vibration and cooling resulted in a redesign of the rear hull. This increased the design weight to nearly 50 tons and accordingly the suspension (which had been designed for 45 tons) was strengthened. Trackpads had to be fitted to protect roads from damage and the ground clearance increased. The design was accepted in the early 1960s.

Britain and Israel had collaborated on the development in its latter stages with a view to Israel purchasing and domestically producing the vehicle. Two prototypes were delivered as part of a four-year trial. However, it was eventually decided not to sell the marque to the Israelis (since, at that period of time in the late 1960s, the UK was more friendly towards the Arab states and Jordan than to Israel), which prompted them to follow their own development programme.
In 1957, NATO had specified that its forces should use multi-fuel engines. The early Leyland engine delivered around to the sprocket, which meant a top road speed of around and cross-country performance was limited. Whilst the Horstmann coil spring suspension reduced the on-road ride-quality compared to tanks with torsion bar suspension, Colonel Peter Hamer of the 11th Hussars commented that &quot;over really bad rough ground it could leave a Leopard for dead&quot;. Due to the cylinder linings being pressure fitted, coolant leaks within the cylinder block were common, resulting in white smoke billowing from the exhaust.

In the late 1970s, engine design changed with the introduction of Belzona which was used to improve the lining seals. Engine output also increased, with later engines delivering some to the sprocket. This meant better performance and an increased speed. However, cross-country performance remained limited.

==Design==

The design of the Chieftain included a heavily sloped hull and turret which greatly increased the effective thickness of the frontal armour – on the glacis (from an actual thickness of ) and on the turret (from ). It had a mantletless turret in order to take full advantage of reclining the vehicle up to ten degrees in a hull-down position.

For security reasons early prototypes had a canvas screen covering the mantlet and a sheet metal box mounted over the sloping glacis plate to disguise the configuration of the vehicle.

The driver lay semi-recumbent in the hull when his hatch was closed down which helped to reduce the profile of the forward glacis plate. The commander, gunner and loader were situated in the turret. To the left side of the turret was a large searchlight with infrared capability in an armoured housing.

The original design of the Chieftain tank called for a petrol &quot;V8 Rolls Royce engine&quot;. With a two year delay in the development of the V8 engine - &quot;the decision was taken to drop the V8 and go with a yet to be produced multi fuel engine.&quot;
The Leyland L60 engine is a two-stroke opposed piston design intended for multi-fuel use so that it could run on whatever fuel was available. In practice the engine did not deliver the expected power and was unreliable, estimated to have a 90% breakdown rate but improvements were introduced to address this. Primary problems included cylinder liner failure, fan drive problems and perpetual leaks due to vibration and badly routed pipework. However, as the engine power improved the tank itself became heavier.

The tank was steered by conventional tillers hydraulically actuating onto external brake discs. The discs worked via the epicyclic gearbox providing &quot;regenerative&quot; steering. The Merritt-Brown TN12 triple-differential gearbox was operated motorcycle-style with a kick up/kick down &quot;peg&quot; on the left, which actuated electro-hydraulic units in the gearbox, the accelerator cable was operated by the right foot. In the turret, the loader was on the left and the gunner on the right of the gun with the commander situated behind the gunner. The suspension was of the Horstmann bogie type with large side steel plates to protect the tracks and provide stand-off protection from hollow charge attack.

The main armament was the 120 mm L11A5 rifled gun. This differed from most contemporary main tank armament as it used projectiles and charges that were loaded separately, as opposed to a single fixed round. The design of the Bagged Charge System was initiated after the earlier Liquid Propellant Gun project had failed due to the injection pump being so large that &quot;no tank could accommodate it&quot;. This led to design studies to find &quot;means of reducing the ammunition size and from this the bagged charge concept emerged&quot;. The charges were encased in combustible bags. Other tank guns such as the 120mm L1 gun on the Conqueror, needed to store the spent shell cartridges or eject them outside. The combustible charges were stored in 36 recesses surrounded by a pressurised water/glycol mixture – so-called &quot;wet-stowage&quot;. In the event of a hit penetrating the fighting compartment, the jacket would rupture soaking the charges and preventing a catastrophic propellant explosion. As there was no shell case, the firing of the charge was by vent tubes automatically loaded from a ten-round magazine on the breech. Due to the length of the gun, which required balancing, and the need for storage space, the turret has a large overhang to the rear. This contains radios, ammunition and fire control equipment and has further stowage externally.

The gun could fire a wide range of ammunition but the most commonly loaded types were high explosive squash head (HESH), armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS), or practice round equivalents for both types. The Chieftain could store up to 64 projectiles (although the propellant stowage allowed a maximum of 36 charges for APDS rounds). The gun was fully stabilised with a fully computerized integrated control system. The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial L8A1 7.62 mm machine gun and another 7.62 mm machine gun mounted on the commander&#x27;s cupola. An advantage of using two-part ammunition was that in the case of inert rounds like APDS the loader could reach for the next round and hold it in his lap, ready to load while the gunner was acquiring the target and firing. This practice increases the rate of fire but would be hazardous with one-piece ammunition.

Chieftain had an NBC protection system which Centurion lacked. An infantry telephone was fitted to the rear of the tank to facilitate communication with infantry.

The initial Fire-control system (FCS) was the Marconi FV/GCE Mk 4. A .50-inch (12.7 mm) ranging gun was mounted above the main gun (with 300 rounds available). This fired ranging shots out to a maximum of , at which point the tracer in the ranging rounds burned out although the high explosive tip still created a visible &quot;splash&quot; on impact. The tank commander had a rotating cupola with nine vision blocks -giving all round view, plus the 7.62 mm machine-gun and an infrared (IR) capable projector coaxial with the weapon. The aiming systems were provided for both the gunner and the tank commander; they had 1x or 10x selectable magnification power, increasing to x15 in the Mk5 and beyond, and they were replaceable with IR vision systems for night operations (3x magnification power). The commander could rotate his cupola to bring his sight onto a target and then engage the mechanism that brought the turret round on to the correct bearing so that the gunner could complete the aiming.

The commander&#x27;s controls had over-ride capability on those of the gunner.
The left side of the turret had a large searchlight with an electrically controlled infrared filter inside an armoured box, with a relatively long range – up to .

From the beginning of the 1970s, the Mk 3/3 version replaced the ranging gun with a Barr and Stroud LF-2 laser rangefinder with a range. This allowed engagements at much longer ranges, and also could be linked to the fire control system, allowing more rapid engagements and changes of target.

On later models, fire control was provided by the Marconi IFCS (Improved Fire Control System), using a digital ballistic computer. The upgrade was not finished until the end of 1980, when some examples (but not the majority) had the IR searchlight replaced with TOGS. Many later examples had Stillbrew armour, intended to defeat Soviet 125 mm tank guns and heavy anti-tank missiles. These became the Mark 10 and then Mk 11 version. The Chieftain used the TESS (TElescopic Sighting System) developed in the early 1980s that was later sold as surplus for use on the RAF Phantom aircraft.

==Service==
Chieftain equipped British units of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) during the Cold War, defended West Germany against possible Warsaw Pact attack.

Like its European competitors, the Chieftain found a large export market in the Middle East, but unlike the Centurion, it was not adopted by any other NATO or Commonwealth country.

The Chieftain proved itself capable in combat and able to be upgraded, both for overall improvement and to meet local requirements. It was continuously upgraded until the early 1990s, when it was replaced by Challenger 1. The final Chieftain version, which was used by the British Army until 1995, incorporated &quot;Stillbrew&quot; armour named after Colonel Still and John Brewer from the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE), the Improved Fire Control System (IFCS) and the Thermal Observation Gunnery Sight (TOGS). The last British Regiment equipped with Chieftains was the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, which was based at Aliwal Barracks, Tidworth.

The first model was introduced in 1967. Chieftains were supplied to at least six countries, including Iran, Kuwait, Oman and Jordan. An agreement for sales to Israel and local production was cancelled by the British Government in 1969, despite considerable Israeli technical and tactical input into the development of the tank, especially the capacity to operate successfully in desert environments, and the provision for the tank to make good use of hull-down positioning. Two examples were delivered to, and extensively trialled by, the Israeli Armoured Corps. This experience spurred the creation of the indigenous Israeli Merkava, the development programme was led by General Israel Tal, who had worked closely with the British in the Anglo-Israeli Chieftain project. The largest foreign sale was to Iran, who, at the recommendation of General Tal, took delivery of 707 Mk-3P and Mk-5P (the letter P standing for Persia), as well as 187 FV4030-1, 41 ARV and 14 AVLB before the 1979 revolution. Further planned deliveries of the more capable FV4030-2 (Shir 1) and FV4030-3 (Shir 2) series were cancelled at that point.

It was in the Middle East that the Chieftain was to see all of its operational experience. It was first used extensively by Iran, during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–88, including the largest tank battle of the war, with mixed results as the Chieftain Mk 3/5 suffered from chronic engine problems and low power-to-weight ratio, making it unreliable and slow when manoeuvering over harsh terrain, which in turn made it prone to breakdowns in the midst of battle or a sluggish target and thus vulnerable to enemy tank fire. After the tank battle at Susangerd, captured Chieftains of the Iranian 92nd Armored Division were taken back to Baghdad for trials. According to Aladdin Makki, the Iraqi Army Corps chief of staff, in a post-war interview, Iraqi sabot rounds &quot;Went through the front armour of the Chieftain and came out the backside&quot;. This as well as the Chieftain&#x27;s poor off-road capability influenced the Iraqis to reject British arms sale propositions, who were at the time courting Iraq for arms sales that included Chieftain MBT&#x27;s. According to Makki, when the British telephoned the Iraqi director of Armor, Salah Askar, he responded with &quot;We don&#x27;t want your stupid tanks!&quot; Ra&#x27;ad Al-Hamdani, an Iraqi general in the Republican Guard, also expressed negative opinion on the Chieftain&#x27;s performance in combat, stating &quot;The 16th Iranian Armored Division, which was equipped with Chieftain tanks, lost a battle against the 10th Iraqi Armored Brigade with T-72 tanks. It is hard for an armored brigade to destroy a division in 12 hours but it happened; it was a disaster for the Iranians&quot;. Out of the 894 Chieftain tanks that had started the war only 200 were left by the war&#x27;s end.

The Chieftain remains in service in Iran, the Mobarez tank being a locally upgraded version.

===Kuwait and the Battle of the Bridges===
Kuwait had 143 Chieftains on the eve of the 1990 Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait. Thirty-seven Chieftains of the Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade fought at the Battle of the Bridges against elements of the Iraqi Hammurabi and Medina divisions before withdrawing over the Saudi border. Kuwaiti 35th Armored Brigade failed to block the Mutla Pass and were ineffective at delaying the Iraqis, however they withdrew into the desert and became part of &quot;Joint Command Forces East&quot; during the 1991 Gulf War.

Besides those of the 35th Armored Brigade, the rest of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces&#x27; Chieftains (136 tanks) were either destroyed or captured by the invading forces after they had been abandoned by their Kuwaiti crews when their ammunition ran out. After the liberation of Kuwait, the ageing Chieftains were replaced by the Yugoslav M-84.

==Variants==
; FV4201 P1 – FV4201 P7:
:Prototypes. Seven built, L60 Mk 1 or L60 Mk 4, initial vehicles had internal exhaust silencers, short hull, small diameter road wheels. In an attempt at reducing the overall height of the vehicle the original design used road wheels of a smaller diameter which gave insufficient ground clearance. They were later replaced with Centurion road wheels of a larger diameter and by careful re-positioning of their mountings along with adjustment of the idler and final drive mountings resulted in a vehicle height only higher than with the original smaller wheels. Initial vehicle weight ; for later vehicles, 1959-1962

In 1975 all British Army earlier Marks of tanks except Mark 1s were upgraded to Chieftain Mk.5 standard as part of the 1975 &quot;Totem Pole&quot; programme. &quot;Exercise Totem Pole&quot; was carried out in six-to-nine phases depending on the Mark of vehicle being modified (Chieftain Mk.5&#x27;s already had some of the required changes incorporated at the factory) between 1975 and 1979 and included fitment of the Marconi Improved Fire Control System (IFCS), replacement of the searchlight with the Barr &amp; Stroud Thermal Observation Gunnery System (TOGS), along with modifications for using FSAPDS ammunition. Upon completion of each phase the vehicle received an additional suffix to the designation, e.g., &quot;Chieftain Mk.3/S(Y)2&quot; denoting a Mark 3/S having completed the first three phases of &quot;Totem Pole&quot;. including addition of Clansman radios, fitting of TLS, fitment of Muzzle Reference System (MRS) upon replacement of L11A3 barrel with L11A5 barrel, and fitment of 750 hp L60 Mark 8A. These vehicles were re-designated Chieftain Mk&#x27;s.6 to Mk.8.

; Chieftain Mk.7C
:Chieftain Mk.3 upgraded to Chieftain Mk.5 standard for Oman
; Chieftain Mk.8
:Chieftain Mk.3/3 upgraded to Chieftain Mk.5 standard, 1975

In 1977 the engines of all British Army vehicles were upgraded to the 750 hp L60 Mark 9A, followed by further upgrading with the L60 Mark 11A or L60 Mark 12A in 1978 as part of the 1977 &quot;Dark Morn&quot; and the 1978 &quot;Sundance&quot; programmes. &quot;Exercise Sundance&quot; concerned improvements in engine power, reliability, and other power train improvements, and was carried out in five main phases between 1976 and 1979. These, in themselves, had been preceded by &quot;Dark Morn&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, and the initial &quot;Fleetfoot&quot; engine development programme which had completed in October 1971. Vehicles on which &quot;Sundance&quot; modifications had been carried out received an additional &#x27;Z&#x27; suffix appended to their designations, the &quot;Sundance&quot; engines themselves were signified with a distinctive orange/yellow-coloured upper crankcase.

; Chieftain Mk.9
:Chieftain Mk.6 after completing all phases of &quot;Totem Pole&quot;, 1979.
; Chieftain Mk.10: Chieftain Mk.7 after completing all phases of &quot;Totem Pole&quot;. Later upgraded with addition of Stillbrew Crew Protection Package which added additional armour to the turret front and turret ring to increase turret frontal protection against HEAT rounds, specifically, the improved variants of the Soviet-made RPG-7, etc., and consisted of conventional steel armour mounted on rubber pads to prevent vibration, 1984–86
; Chieftain Mk.11: Chieftain Mk.8 after completing all phases of &quot;Totem Pole&quot;. Later upgraded with Stillbrew, 1984–86
; Chieftain Mk.12: Chieftain Mk.5 after completing all phases of &quot;Totem Pole&quot;. Later upgraded with Stillbrew, 1984–86
; Chieftain Mk.12/13: Proposed further upgrades, cancelled when the Challenger 1 was introduced.
; Chieftain 800: Re-engined Iranian FV4030/1 Chieftain Mark 5/3P fitted with the Rolls-Royce CV8 TCA engine and the fully automatic TN12 Mk. 5 transmission.

; Chieftain 900: Two Mk. 5/3 (P) were converted by Royal Ordnance Factories by fitting the Rolls-Royce Condor 900E engine and the fully automatic TN12-1000 version of the Chieftain&#x27;s gearbox, hence the name of Chieftain 900. The two Chieftain 900 prototypes were built in April 1982 and were exhibited the same year at the British Army Equipment Exhibition (BAEE). They were not fitted with real Chobham armour but were mocked up with cosmetic sheet-metal cladding to simulate the Chobham armour package. The project was abandoned by 1986.
; FV4030/1 Chieftain Mk. 5/3 (P) « Persia » : Also known as &quot;Project 4030 Phase 1&quot; or &quot;Improved Chieftain&quot;. The Mk. 5/3P featured the Tank Laser Sight (TLS), the Muzzle Reference System (MRS), a fully automatic controller for the TN12 gearbox, a fuel capacity increase, thickened underbelly mine armour and shock absorbers fitted to the front and rear suspension units. 185 vehicles were built between August 1976 and late 1977/early 1978.
; FV4030/2 Shir (Lion) 1: Also known as &quot;4030 Phase 2&quot;. This tank formed Phase 2 of the Iranian contract for the supply of a new generation of MBTs (Phase 1 being for an Improved Chieftain). This project began in 1974. Shir 1 incorporated the Chieftain hull front and turret casting. The rear of the hull was reconfigured to accept a new power pack comprising Rolls-Royce CV12 (a turbocharged V12 four-stroke diesel engine), David Brown TN37 transmission and new cooling group. An improved bogie suspension (Super Horstmann), new final drives and tracks were included. The first vehicle-ran in April 1977 and no production deliveries had taken place when the project was cancelled in February 1979.

; Khalid: Also known as &quot;4030 Phase 2 Jordan&quot;. The sale of 274 MBTs was negotiated with Jordan in June 1979 following the cancellation of the Iranian contract. The Khalid tank is based on the Shir 1 design with the addition of the Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS), Tank Laser Sight (TLS) and the No 84 Day/Night Sight. The first 125 were reworked Shir 1s and the remaining 149 were new production tanks. The order has been completed, the first being delivered in July 1981.
;FV4030/3 Shir 2: Also known as &quot;&#x27;4030 Phase 3&#x27;&quot; Iranian variant. The Shir 2 represented a completely new-MBT incorporating Chobham armour (renamed &quot;Pageant&quot; to avoid diplomatic incident with the US government) to the hull and turret, with the rear of the hull similar in design to the Shir 1. The fire control, gun control and automotive systems were the same as Shir 1 with the following exceptions: Automotive - the option of adopting hydrogas suspension and command &amp; control, the new No 84 commander&#x27;s (PPE) day/night sight. The project began in 1974 and the first vehicle ran in October 1978. The production order was for 1,200 MBTs and production release given for 250 before cancellation in February 1979. Not delivered, the Shir 2 tanks became FV4030/4 Challenger 1 tanks after reworking at ROF Leeds.
;Mobarez Tank:Iranian upgraded version of Chieftain. :
;Chieftain/ T95: Development of the FV4201 Chieftain allowed for the interchangeability of guns with the U.S. T95 tank by means of exchanging turrets. The project was discontinued because of numerous problems with training crews to master two artillery systems. Equipped with a 90mm T208 (rifled) gun.
;FV4211: Test vehicle using Chieftain automotive sub systems (including the L60 engine), embodied in a new aluminium hull and turret structure incorporating Chobham Armour (CA) for the first time. The project began in October 1969. A feasibility study was completed by February 1970 which led to MVEE being asked to design and produce a prototype within a year. This timescale was achieved, the MVEE produced the first prototype in February 1971. Although the project was officially discontinued in 1972, research work within MVEE continued until 1974. A paper study on a Mk. 2 version was carried out and was considered during the FMBT (Future Main Battle Tank) studies in 1974.

<text>The Saho language (Tigrinya: ) is an Afro-Asiatic language spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It belongs to the family&#x27;s Cushitic branch.

==Overview==
Saho is spoken natively by the Saho people. Traditionally, they inhabit the territory in Eritrea bounded by the bay of Erafayle (ዓራፋሊ) in the east, the Laacasi Gade (ላዐሲ ጋደ) valleys in the south, and the Eritrean highlands to the west (the Shimejana district on the eastern flank of the South- or Debub region in what was formerly known as Akele Guzai province).

This speech area is bordered by other Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities, with Tigre speakers on the west and Afar speakers on the east. In Ethiopia, Saho is primarily spoken in the Tigray Region. It has about 250,000 speakers in total and four main dialects: Northern dialect, mainly spoken by Casawurta (ዓሳኣዉርታ), Tharuuca (ጣሩዓ), Casabat Care (ዓሳባት ካረ), etc.; Central dialect is mainly spoken by Faqhat Xarak (ፋቃት ሓራክ) of Minifere (ሚኒ ፊረ); Southern dialect mainly spoken by Minifire (ሚኒ ፊረ), Xazo (ሓዞ/ዶ), Dabrti-meela ዳብሪ መላ), Irob (ኢሮብ), Sancafe (ሳንዓፈ).

The Saho also use the Arabic (special now Latin letters) to document their history and render information.

The Saho language in former Italian Eritrea has received a strong influence of italian loanwords.

Also recently the language is being used on the cyberspace as a tool of communication. And there is one website completely designed with saho language.

Saho is so closely related to the Cushitic Afar language, spoken as a mother tongue by the Afar people, that some linguists regard the two tongues as dialects of a single &quot;Saho–Afar language&quot;. Regardless, it has been shown that at least in their basic lexicon the two can be cleanly separated.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
* Sounds /t̪ʼ, sʼ, z, kʼ, ʔ/ are heard from loanwords.
* /b/ can be heard as [β] when in intervocalic positions or when preceding a fricative consonant.
* /t̪, d̪/ can be heard as laminal [t̻, d̻] when before or after /a/.
* /ɾ/ can be heard as a trill [r] in free variation.
* /ɖ/ can be heard as a flap [ɽ] in intervocalic positions.
* /l/ can be heard as apical [l̺] or alveolar [l] when before vowels /i, u/, and as laminal [l̻] when before vowels /a, e, o/.
* /n/ when preceding sounds /b, f, ɖ, k, ɡ/ can be heard as [m, ɱ, ɳ, ŋ].
* /ʡ/ can also be heard as a fricative [ʕ] in free variation or in intervocalic position.
* Stops /b, t̪, d̪, ɖ/ are heard as unreleased [b̚, t̪̚, d̪̚, ɖ̚] when in word-final position.

=== Vowels ===
* /ɛ/ can be heard as either [ɛ] or [e], and may occur as [ə] when in unstressed positions.
* /ɔ/ may be pronounced as either [ɔ] or [o] among speakers across dialects.

==Writing systems==
Saho has three written versions: a version in the Latin alphabet, official in Eritrea; a version in the Ge&#x27;ez script, official in Ethiopia; and a version in the Ajami script with no official recognition.

<doc id="1109869" wikidata="Q633163" url="?curid=1109869" title="Union for National Progress">
<text>The Union for National Progress (, UPRONA) is a nationalist political party in Burundi. Initially it emerged as a nationalist united front in opposition to Belgian colonial rule but subsequently became an integral part of the one-party state established by Michel Micombero after 1966. Dominated by members of the Tutsi ethnic group and increasingly intolerant to their Hutu counterparts, UPRONA remained the dominant force in Burundian politics until the latter stages of the Burundian Civil War in 2003. It is currently a minor opposition party.

==History==
Sources differ on the circumstances of UPRONA&#x27;s founding. According to political scientist Warren Weinstein, UPRONA was created shortly after a 1958 meeting of customary chiefs and clergy convened by Burundian prince Louis Rwagasore and Léopold Biha to discuss nationalist ideas. According to Biha, UPRONA was created in 1957 to protest a Belgian administrative reorganisation that disempowered the monarchy. According to linguist Ellen K. Eggers, UPRONA was formed in the late 1950s and Rwagasore became heavily involved with it in 1958. Historian Ludo De Witte wrote that Rwagasore and some associates organised the first UPRONA meetings in September and October 1958. According to Governor Jean-Paul Harroy, Rwagasore founded the party in late 1959. It received official recognition from the colonial administration as a political party on 7 January 1960.

Rwagasore took virtual control over the movement, though his familial connection to the Mwami disqualified him from holding any party offices and he officially served UPRONA only as an advisor. UPRONA was able to secure the early financial support of the Swahili population in Bujumbura and Lake Tanganyika coastline. The party initially was strongly identified with the interests of the Bezi lineage of Ganwa and support for traditional institutions, but this alignment fell apart after Rwagasore came into conflict with his father. Under Rwagasore, UPRONA pushed a program of modernisation, committing neither to a return to the feudal system nor a complete societal transformation. He used symbols of the monarchy to communicate his message and often emphasised his princely status at public appearances, but he stressed that UPRONA would support the monarchy &quot;only insofar as this regime and its dynasty favoured the genuine emancipation of the Murundi people&quot;. 

Rwagasore sought to transform UPRONA into a mass party with broad-base appeal across different regions, ethnicities, and castes. Wary of the growing Hutu–Tutsi ethnic conflict in Ruanda, he sought to counteract tensions by bringing members of both groups into UPRONA&#x27;s leadership. Formal party positions at both the national and local levels were usually evenly divided between Hutus and Tutsis, though the latter tended to occupy the most important offices. The party enjoyed some cohesive success in Usumbura, but never truly cultivated a mass political base, especially outside the capital. UPRONA&#x27;s internal rules set devolved responsibilities to the central committee, but in practice the party operated at the whim of Rwagasore; it retained relatively weak organisational capability and was held together by his charismatic leadership. His populist tendencies and personal popularity led many of the original chiefs who had supported UPRONA, including founding member Biha, to leave the party and engage in their own political activities. In their place, the party relied upon the support of seminary graduates, évolués, and younger chiefs.

Shortly before Burundi&#x27;s first municipal elections in 1960, the Belgian administration—fearful of communist sympathies in UPRONA—placed Rwagasore under house arrest and forced many other party figures into exile. UPRONA declared a boycott of the elections which, UPRONA&#x27;s rivals, specifically the Christian Democratic Party (&quot;Parti Démocratique Chrétien&quot;, PDC), performed well in, with Belgian support. Of the 2,876 offices available, UPRONA won 545, while the PDC won 942. UPRONA was not represented in the national transitional government established by the colonial administration in January 1961.

For the 1961 legislative elections, UPRONA concentrated its entire election campaign on Rwagasore, using his charisma to rally substantial support. Burundi hosted legislative elections on 18 September 1961. With approximately 80% voter turnout, UPRONA won 58 of 64 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and Rwagasore was declared . Ten days later the Legislative Assembly installed a 10-member government with Rwagasore as prime minister. He was assassinated in October in a plot conceived by PDC figures, who were subsequently arrested and executed. The murder fractured UPRONA, as Rwagasore&#x27;s former lieutenants struggled to succeed him as the party&#x27;s leader. 

Conflict embroiled UPRONA over who would assume the party presidency, with André Muhirwa—the new prime minister—seeking it with the support of a Tutsi faction and Paul Mirerekano aiming to secure it with the backing of a Hutu faction. Muhirwa&#x27;s group would be dubbed the Casablanca faction, while Mirerekano&#x27;s group would become known as the Monrovia faction. The party increasingly split along ethnic lines. The assumption of numerous UPRONA figures into official government roles also decimated the independent structure of the organisation. In the county&#x27;s 1965 elections, most UPRONA candidates faced opposition from others bearing the UPRONA label; in some constituencies, there as many as five competing slates of candidates with the same affiliation. In practice, there were two main factions: &quot;populaire&quot; or pro-Hutu and &quot;traditionaliste&quot; or pro Tutsi. Ultimately, UPRONA-aligned candidates won 21 of the 33 seats in the National Assembly.

UPRONA&#x27;s most famous Prime Minister and Burundian National Hero is Louis Rwagasore (assassinated in 1961). From that time until 1965, the party also had some Hutu support, and three of its Hutu members, including Pierre Ngendandumwe, became Prime Minister of Burundi. The party was taken over by President Michel Micombero in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and became a pillar of the military dictatorships that ruled the country from 1966 to 1993. In 1993, UPRONA placed second in contested elections to Melchior Ndadaye&#x27;s FRODEBU.

UPRONA President Pierre Buyoya handed over power to Hutu leader Domitien Ndayizeye of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (a Hutu-based party) on 30 April 2003. At the legislative elections in 2005, the party won 7.2% and 15 out of 118 seats.

During the 2010 elections, UPRONA boycotted councillors&#x27; and presidential elections but decided to participate in the legislative elections claiming the need to form an opposition bloc in Parliament and to better compete in the 2015 elections.

<text>The Khoja are a caste of Muslims mainly members of the Nizari Ismaʿiliyyah sect of Islam with a minority of followers of Sunni Islam originating the western Indian subcontinent, and converted to Islam from Hinduism by the 14th century by the Persian &quot;pīr&quot; (religious leader or teacher) Saḍr-al-Dīn. 

In India, most Khojas live in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and the city of Hyderabad. In Pakistan, most Khoja live in Karachi, Hyderabad and Thatta in Sindh province, and in Gwadar in Balochistan province. There is a diaspora of Khojas and they are known by many names such as the Lawatia in the Gulf and Karana in Madagascar. 

The Khoja originally observed Hinduism and then became adherents of Nizari Isma&#x27;ilism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the aftermath of the Aga Khan Case a small minority separated and adopted Sunni Islam and Twelver Shi&#x27;ia Islam, while the majority remained Nizari Isma&#x27;ili.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Khoja&quot; derives from &quot;Khwāja&quot; (New Persian &quot;Khājé&quot;), a Persian honorific title (خواجه) of pious individuals used in Turco-Persian influenced regions of the Muslim world.

The specific term &quot;Khoja&quot; in the Gujarati and Sindhi languages, was first bestowed by the Persianate Nizari Isma&#x27;ili Sadardin (died c. 15th century) upon his followers during the lifetime of the &quot;Nizari Ismaili Imam Islam Shah&quot; (1368-1423 CE). As such, Pir Shihab al-din Shah, brother of one of the Nizari Ismaili imams, wrote regarding the origins of the Khojas that the very formation of the community came about through Pir Sadardin&#x27;s devotion to the Imam.

Many Lohanas of Gujarat converted to Nizari Ismailism due to the efforts of Pir Sadardin. They gradually used the title &quot;Khoja.&quot; Before the arrival of the Aga Khan from Persia to British ruled India in the 19th century, Khojas retained many Hindu traditions, including a variation on the belief in the Dashavatara.

==History==
=== Origins and syncretism ===
The Khojas are an ethnic and cultural group originating from Hindu Lohanas. Their ethnonym &quot;Khoja&quot; is derived from the Persian term &quot;khwāja&quot;, which roughly translates to &#x27;Lord&#x27; or &#x27;Master&#x27;. However, this term also included certain groups such as Charanas, predominantly from Gujarat and Kutch. 

The Hindu Lohanas from Sindh were converted to Nizārī Ismāʿīlism by Pīr Ṣadr al-Dīn in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Ṣadr al-Dīn was a dāʿī (&quot;missionary&quot;) acting on behalf of the Nizārī imām who lived in Persia. Ṣadr al-Dīn belonged to a hereditary lineage of pīrs who served as leaders for the Khoja community as a deputy of the imām in Persia.

The pīrs composed religious hymns called &quot;ginān&quot;s that served as the religious scriptures for the Khojas rather than the Qurʾān. The majority of the gināns glorify the Nizārī imām as an absolute and infallible leader. Some gināns contain large amounts of Hindu-Muslim syncretism, with Hindu deities being identified with Muslim figures. The gināns took inspiration from diverse traditions, including Nizārī Ismāʿīlism, Hindu Sant and Bhakti traditions, and Ṣūfism. Such syncretism with Hinduism has been viewed as a strategy by the Ismāʿīlī missionaries to convert Hindus, as well as &quot;taqiyya&quot; to hide them from other Muslims. The religion of the Khojas was known as Satpanth.

At the end of the fifteenth century, the imām in Persia, al-Mustanṣir bi-llāh II, abolished the pīrs as a source of religious authority, and replaced them with a book called &quot;Pandiyāt-i jawānmardī&quot;, which was then translated into Gujarātī. Imām Shāh (d. 1513) was supposed to become the next &quot;pīr&quot;, but in response to the imam&#x27;s decision, &quot;Imam Shāh&#x27;s&quot; son &quot;Nūr Muḥammad&quot; claimed he was the imām and founded a splinter sect called the &quot;Imām-Shāhīs&quot;, also known as the &quot;Sat-Panthīs&quot;.

In the nineteenth century, the Khojas gathered in jamāʿatkhāna buildings, did not read the Qurʾān, and generally did not follow Islamic law.

The Khojas, mainly merchants from Kutch and Kathiawar, began moving to Bombay in the late 1700s. There they were engaged in petty trade and shop-keeping, with larger magnates gaining fortunes from trade routes with China, Muscat, and Zanzibar.

=== Arrival of Āghā Khān and Ismāʿīlī Islamisation ===
In 1845, Ḥasan ʿAlī Shāh aka Āghā Khān I moved to India due to conflict with the Qajar dynasty in Persia. He settled in Bombay, which had the largest concentration of Khojas in India. For centuries the Khojas had been a self governing community with nominal allegiance to a distant Nizārī imām in Persia, but the newly arrived Āghā Khān sought to interfere in their internal affairs. This led to conflict in the Khoja community, culminating in the Āghā Khān case of 1866. The Khoja plaintiffs argued that community in fact were Sunnī Muslims and thus were not under the authority of the Āghā Khān imām. The British judge decided in favour of the defendant, Āghā Khān I, ruling that the Khojas were the descendants of Hindus who became Shīʿa Ismāʿīlīs and thus were under the religious authority of the imām, Āghā Khān I. In response to the verdict, some Khojas converted to Sunnī Islam.

The imām succeeding the next imām, Sulṭān Muḥammad Shāh Āghā Khān III (r. 1885–1957) continued to attempt exert his authority over the Khojas and push them towards normative Ismāʿīlī–Shīʿa Islam; this led to the Haji Bibi case. The plaintiffs in the Haji Bibi case of 1908 claimed that the Khojas were followers of Twelver Shīʿa Islam, however the British judge upheld that the Khojas were Ismāʿīlī and so those Khojas split off to follow Twelver Shi&#x27;ism.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Khojas were under pressure from the Āghā Khāns as well as Muslim and Hindu fundamentalist movements to alter their religion. The religious fundamentalists considered the Khojas to be heretics who should convert to Sunnī or Twelver Shīʿī Islam or normative Hinduism. The Āghā Khāns who wielded religious power over the community as imām sought to Islamise the community to normative Ismāʿīlism. The gināns were codified under their authority, those with Hindu influences were purged, and new gināns were composed with Qurʾānic verses. The use of the Gujarātī language was also replaced by English. By the time of the imām Shāh Karīm al-Ḥusaynī Āghā Khān IV (r. 1957-2025), the Khojas had been integrated into a transnational Ismāʿīlī community with a focus on the Qurʾān and literacy of Islamic concepts.

The Khojas live today in India and Pakistan, with a significant diaspora in East Africa, Europe, and North America. They show a strong commitment to the values of Indo-Muslim philanthropy in their business entrepreneurship and contribution to societies in which they live. From the 18th century, some of the Khojas have migrated to the Persian Gulf region, mainly in the Sultanate of Oman and U.A.E, where they are known as Al-Lawatia.

==Khoja communities==

===Isma&#x27;ili Khojas===

Originally Nizari Isma&#x27;ili, after the 1866 Aga Khan Case that consolidated the bulk of the Bombay Khoja community under the leadership of the Aga Khan. The Khojas credit their title to Pir Sadr al-Din who allegedly laid the foundations for the Nizari Ismaili community in India, even before the Anjudan phase of the history of Nizari Ismailism.

===Twelver Khojas===
Khojas who follow Twelver Shia Islam and have large communities in Pakistan, India, East Africa, North America and the United Kingdom.
Moulvi Ali Baksh who had settled in Mumbai in the mid-late 1800s was a prominent Moulvi with great respect in Ithna&#x27;ashari Khoja community. It is said that then the Shias were organised into a distinct community by Moulvi Ali Baksh himself. (Excerpts as translated from the book Greatness Bygone authored by Ziauddin Ahmed Barni Published by Taleemi Markaz Karachi on 30 July 1961, Page: 342 written on one of 93 great personalities Ali Mohammed Moulvi. The author had not met only 2 of the 93 personalities noted in his book).

Twelver Khojas are said to have broken away from the Isma&#x27;ili Khojas due to their determination to defend their remembrance practices against Aga Khan&#x27;s efforts to ban them, in order to elevate his personal status as the reincarnation of Isma&#x27;il ibn Ja&#x27;far, the seventh Imām of the Isma&#x27;ilis.

== Culture ==

=== Dress ===
Traditionally, Khoja men wore a &quot;pāghaḍī&quot; (loose white turban), &quot;chol&quot; (double breasted jacket), &quot;suthaḷī&quot; (trousers) or &quot;dhotiyuṁ&quot; (dhoti), and pointed shoes. By the second half of the 20th century, Khoja men had forsaken their traditional garb in favour of &quot;ṭopī&quot; (velvet cap), &quot;kabjo&quot; (European shirt/long jacket), &quot;paheraṇ&quot; (collarless inner shirt), and &quot;survāl&quot; (European buttoned trousers or waist-string trousers). Khoja women wear a tight blouse or short armed jacket, a &quot;ghāghro&quot; skirt as a lower garment, and an &quot;oḍhaṇī&quot; (veil) on the head.

<doc id="1109872" wikidata="Q6308787" url="?curid=1109872" title="The Two Doctors">
<text>The Two Doctors is the fourth serial of the 22nd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in three weekly parts on BBC1 from 16 February to 2 March 1985.

The serial is set on an alien space station and in and around Seville. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker), his former travelling companion Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and his current companion Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant) work to save the younger Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) from the biogeneticist Dastari (Laurence Payne), who intends to steal the knowledge of how to travel in time from the Second Doctor&#x27;s genetic make-up.

This serial marks Troughton&#x27;s final appearance as the Second Doctor before his death in 1987.

==Plot==
The Second Doctor and Jamie McCrimmon land the TARDIS on board Space Station Camera, where they talk to Dastari, the Head of Projects. The Doctor tells Dastari that the Time Lords want the time experiments stopped, but Dastari refuses. Also on board are the Androgums, a gluttonous alien species who are conspiring with the Sontarans to take over the station. The ship&#x27;s Androgum cook, Shockeye, drugs the crew&#x27;s dinner to give the Sontarans an opportunity to invade.

In the TARDIS, the Sixth Doctor has a vision of his second incarnation being put to death. He decides to consult his old friend Dastari to see if he can help. The Doctor and Peri arrive on the station and are taken prisoner by the Sontarans. The ship lands in Seville, Spain, where the Androgums and Sontarans take over a local hacienda to use as a base of operations.

Dastari reveals his plan to dissect the Second Doctor&#x27;s cell structure to isolate his symbiotic nuclei and give them to Chessene, an Androgum technologically augmented to genius levels. Upon discovering there are two Time Lords on the ship, Chessene asks Dastari to turn the Second Doctor into an Androgum instead. They also intend to eliminate the Sontarans.

Dastari implants the Second Doctor with a 50 per cent Androgum inheritance. The Second Doctor and Shockeye go to a restaurant and order gargantuan amounts of food. When the restaurant&#x27;s owner, Oscar, demands that they pay, Shockeye fatally stabs him, just as the Sixth Doctor and the others arrive. Shockeye leaves the Second Doctor, who slowly reverts to normal. Chessene and Dastari take them back to the hacienda at gunpoint.

The Sixth Doctor frees himself and kills Shockeye. Chessene sees the Doctor&#x27;s blood and starts licking it. Dastari realises that no matter how augmented she may be, Chessene is still an Androgum, and decides to free the Second Doctor, Peri, and Jamie. When Chessene sees this, she shoots and kills Dastari. She tries to shoot the Second Doctor and Peri, but Jamie throws a knife at her wrist, making her drop the gun. Chessene goes into the module, hoping to escape, but the sabotaged module explodes, killing Chessene and reverting her back to her Androgum self. Jamie and the Second Doctor depart in their TARDIS, whilst the Sixth Doctor tells Peri they&#x27;re both going on a vegetarian diet from now on.

==Production==

Robert Holmes, a vegetarian, wrote the serial as an allegory about meat-eating, hunting and butchering. &quot;Androgum&quot; is an anagram of &quot;gourmand&quot;.

Holmes&#x27;s original brief from producer John Nathan-Turner was to write a serial taking place in New Orleans, involving the Sontarans, the First Doctor portrayed by Richard Hurndall and the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan Foreman, played by Carole Ann Ford, reprising their roles from &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. Hurndall&#x27;s death in April 1984 saw the brief revised to feature the Second Doctor and Jamie, but the setting had to be changed to Spain instead when the expected funding for location filming in the United States fell through.

In his 1986 interview for &quot;Starburst&quot;, script editor Eric Saward said he thought this story was &quot;poorly directed&quot;.

===Cast notes===
This story marked the final appearance of Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor and the final on-screen appearance of Frazer Hines as Jamie. Veteran actress Aimee Delamain appears in a cameo role as the ill-fated hacienda owner the Doña Arana. 

==Broadcast and reception==
&quot;The Two Doctors&quot; was one of several stories from this era to provoke controversy over its depiction of violence. In 1985, Australasian &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Fan Club president Tony Howe criticised the murder of Oscar with a kitchen knife as being an instance of &quot;sick, shock violence&quot; that was present for &quot;cheap shock value only&quot;.

Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial two stars out of five, stating: &quot;&quot;The Two Doctors&quot; wasn&#x27;t dire, but the actors and audience deserved better.&quot; In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; seven out of ten, describing it as &quot;a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; version of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; as sponsored by the Vegetarian Society.&quot; Television historian Marcus Harmes says of it &quot;Besides the inherent joy of having Troughton and Hines back, the location filming around the hacienda and up and down the alleys in Seville is evocative, and the guest cast is brilliant&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
The novelisation of this serial, by Robert Holmes, was published in hardback and paperback in August 1985 as the 100th &quot;Doctor Who&quot; release by Target Books. This was Holmes&#x27;s only complete novelisation and seeks to clear up some of the continuity errors in the original broadcast. With a gold foil-embossed cover, it was billed on release as the 100th novelisation and featured an introduction by John Nathan-Turner.

===Home media===
&quot;The Two Doctors&quot; was released on VHS in November 1993. It was released on DVD in the UK in September 2003 in a two-disc set as part of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 40th Anniversary Celebration releases, representing the Colin Baker years, with many extra features, including the &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; sketch &quot;A Fix with Sontarans&quot;. The DVD contains a full-length commentary provided by director Peter Moffatt and actors Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Frazer Hines, and Jacqueline Pearce. The DVD was subsequently incorporated into the box set &quot;Bred for War&quot;, along with &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; and &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;. Following the sexual abuse accusations regarding Jimmy Savile, the DVD was withdrawn from sale but has since been rereleased with the offending sketch removed. The BBC has made the serial available for download on Apple iTunes. It was released in issue 45 of Doctor Who DVD Files.

It was released as part of the ‘Doctor Who The Collection: Season 22’ blu-ray box set on 20 June 2022. An extended cut of Part One was included as an extra on the set with a runtime of 47:33, running 3 minutes and 11 seconds longer than the original broadcast episode.

<doc id="1109878" wikidata="Q1132110" url="?curid=1109878" title="Corduroy">
<text>Corduroy is a textile with a distinctively raised &quot;cord&quot; or wale texture. Modern corduroy is most commonly composed of tufted cords, sometimes exhibiting a channel (bare to the base fabric) between them. Both velvet and corduroy derive from fustian fabric. Corduroy looks as if it is made from multiple cords laid parallel to each other.

==Etymology==
A common false etymology holds that the word &quot;corduroy&quot; derives from the French phrase &quot;corde du roi&quot; or &quot;the cord of the king&quot;. The word &quot;corduroy&quot; is from &quot;cord&quot; (i.e., rope) and &quot;duroy,&quot; which was a coarse woollen cloth made in England in the 18th century.

==Variations==
Corduroy is made by weaving extra sets of fibre into the base fabric to form vertical ridges called &quot;wales&quot;. The wales are built so that clear lines can be seen when they are cut into pile.

Corduroy is considered a durable cloth and is found in the construction of trousers, jackets, and shirts. The width of the wales varies between fabric styles and is specified by &quot;wale count&quot;—the number of wales per inch. A wale is a column of loops running lengthwise, corresponding to the warp of woven fabric. The lower the number, the thicker the wales&#x27; width (e.g., 4-wale is much thicker than 11-wale). Wale count per inch can vary from 1.5 to 21, although the traditional standard is usually between 10 and 12. Wide wale is more commonly used in trousers, and furniture upholstery (primarily couches); medium, narrow, and fine wale fabrics are usually found in garments worn above the waist.
The primary types of corduroy are:
* Standard wale, at 11 wales/inch, available in many colours
* Pincord (also called pinwale or needlecord), the finest cord, with a count at the upper end of the spectrum (above 16)
* Pigment dyed/printed corduroy, where the fabric is coloured or printed with pigment dyes. The dye is applied to the surface; then, the garment is cut and sewn. When washed during the final manufacturing phase, the pigment dye washes out in an irregular way, creating a vintage look. Because of these subtle colour variations, no two garments of pigment-dyed corduroy are exactly alike, and their colour becomes softer with each washing.

Corduroy is traditionally used in making British country clothing, even though its origin lies in items worn by townspeople in industrial areas. Although it has existed for a long time and has been used in Europe since the 18th century, only in the 20th century did it become global, notably expanding in popularity during the 1970s.

==Other names==
Other names are often used for corduroy. Alternative names include: corded velveteen, elephant cord (the thick-stripes version), pin cord, Manchester cloth and cords.

In continental Europe, corduroy is known as &quot;Cord&quot;, &quot;rib cord&quot; or &quot;rib velvet&quot; - in parts of Europe such as Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Belgium it used to be simply known as &quot;Manchester&quot; - that still remains the current name for corduroy in Swedish. In Portugal, corduroy is associated with a completely different type of fabric, &quot;bombazine&quot;, and is referred to as such. In Greece and Cyprus they are known as kotlé pants. In Iran they are referred to as &quot;Makhmal Kebrity&quot; (velvet matchstick) or just &quot;kebrity&quot; (matchstick) pants as the width of a cord resembles that of a matchstick.

<doc id="1109881" wikidata="Q203585" url="?curid=1109881" title="A Woman of No Importance">
<text>A Woman of No Importance by Oscar Wilde is &quot;a new and original play of modern life&quot;, in four acts, first given on 19 April 1893 at the Haymarket Theatre, London. Like Wilde&#x27;s other society plays, it satirises English upper-class society. It has been revived from time to time since his death in 1900, but has been widely regarded as the least successful of his four drawing room plays.

==Background and first production==
Wilde&#x27;s first West End drawing room play, &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, ran at the St James&#x27;s Theatre for 197 performances in 1892. He briefly moved away from the genre to write his biblical tragedy &quot;Salome&quot;, after which he accepted a request from the actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree for a new play for Tree&#x27;s company at the Haymarket Theatre. Wilde worked on it while staying in Norfolk in the summer, and later in a rented flat in St James&#x27;s, impeded by constant interruptions by Lord Alfred Douglas.

Tree accepted the finished play in October 1892. The leading female role, Mrs Arbuthnot, was intended for Madge Kendal, but for contractual reasons she withdrew and was replaced by Mrs Bernard Beere. The play was first performed on 19 April 1893 at the Haymarket Theatre, London, to an audience that included Arthur Balfour and Joseph Chamberlain; the Prince of Wales attended the second night. The production ran for 113 performances, closing on 16 August.

==Plot==
The play is set in &quot;the present&quot; (i.e. 1893).

===Act I===
;The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase
[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Lord Illingworth, 1907 revival|alt=dandyish middle-aged white man, with dapper moustache in elegant summer suit
The play opens with a party on a terrace in Lady Hunstanton&#x27;s estate. The upper class guests spend the better part of Act I exchanging social gossip and small talk. Lady Caroline Pontefract patronises an American visitor, Hester Worsley, and proceeds to give her own opinion of everyone in the room (and her surrounding life). Lady Caroline also denounces Hester&#x27;s enthusiasm for Gerald Arbuthnot until Gerald himself enters to proclaim that Lord Illingworth, a powerful, flirtatious male political figure, intends to take him under his wing as secretary. This is great news for Gerald, as being Lord Illingworth&#x27;s secretary would be the young man&#x27;s first step to a life of financial/political success. The guests then discuss the rumours surrounding Lord Illingworth&#x27;s aim for being a foreign ambassador, while Lady Hunstanton sends a letter through her footman to Gerald&#x27;s mother, inviting her to the party.

Gerald offers to take Hester for a walk, leaving the remaining guests to gossip further about their social lives. Lady Hunstanton and Lady Stutfield comment on the yet unseen Lord Illingworth&#x27;s amoral qualities towards women when the man himself enters the terrace. He declines their thanks for his hiring of Gerald Arbuthnot and says that he hired him out of personal interest. Lord Illingworth remains near Mrs Allonby during the entire exchange until the two of them leave for the conservatory together, following a discussion of Hester&#x27;s background and wealthy father.
A footman enters with a letter from Mrs Arbuthnot, stating that she will come to the party after dinner.
When Illingworth and Mrs Allonby return, the remaining guests have already moved to have tea in another room. The two characters have a witty conversation involving marriage and women and men until Gerald and Hester enter the room. They have some short small talk, and Lord Illingworth and Mrs Allonby are again left alone. Their discussion turns toward Hester when Mrs Allonby reprehends the young American for her casual talk of being eighteen and a Puritan. Lord Illingworth expresses that he rather admires Hester&#x27;s beauty and actually uses the conversation to assert his flirtations toward Mrs Allonby, claiming that he has never met a woman so puritanical as Hester that she would steadfastly resist all and any advances. Mrs Allonby asserts that Hester is sincere in her desire to be left alone, but Illingworth interprets her remarks as a playful challenge.
Lord Illingworth notices Mrs Arbuthnot&#x27;s letter lying on a table and remarks that the handwriting on the envelope seems familiar. When Mrs Allonby asks who the handwriting reminds him of, he carelessly mentions &quot;a woman of no importance.&quot;

===Act II===
;Drawing room at Hunstanton
Gerald&#x27;s mother arrives at the end of an argument between Hester and the upper-class women. Lord Illingworth enters shortly after, and Gerald uses the opportunity to introduce him to Mrs Arbuthnot. The three share an uncomfortable exchange, as Mrs Arbuthnot (to Gerald&#x27;s dismay) can only partially express her disapproval of Illingworth&#x27;s offer. Lord Illingworth excuses himself, and Lady Hunstanton calls everyone into her music-room soon after. Illingworth, however, asks to remain behind to speak with Mrs Arbuthnot.

What follows is the revelation that Gerald is the illegitimate child of Mrs Arbuthnot and Lord Illingworth, once known as George Harford. Years ago, Mrs Arbuthnot and George Harford conceived a child, yet Harford refused to marry Arbuthnot. Harford had offered to provide financial security through his mother, but according to Mrs Arbuthnot, it was his refusal to marry that forced her to leave him and live an arduous life as a scandalous single mother. Mrs Arbuthnot retains a strong bitterness toward Illingworth, yet also begs him to leave her son alone, expressing that after twenty years of being a mother, Gerald is all she has. She refuses to allow Gerald to stay with his father, but Illingworth questions how she will force Gerald to do what she wants. He tells Mrs Arbuthnot that Gerald should be able to choose his own future. Gerald then enters, and Lord Illingworth assures him and his mother that Gerald has the highest qualities that the man had hoped for in a secretary. Illingworth demands any other reason for Mrs Arbuthnot to protest against Gerald&#x27;s opportunity. Unwilling to reveal her son&#x27;s true heritage, Mrs Arbuthnot says that she has no other reason.

===Act III===
;The Hall at Hunstanton Chase
Act III opens with Gerald and Lord Illingworth talking about Mrs Arbuthnot. Gerald speaks of his admiration and protective attitude toward his mother, expressing that she is a great woman and wondering why she has never told him of his father. Lord Illingworth agrees that his mother is a great woman, but he further explains that great women have certain limitations that inhibit the desires of young men. Leading the conversation into a cynical talk about society and marriage, Lord Illingworth says that he has never been married and that Gerald will have a new life under his wing. Soon the other guests enter, and Lord Illingworth entertains them with his invigorating views on a variety of subjects, such as comedy and tragedy, savages, and world society. Everything Lord Illingworth has to say opposes the norm and excites his company, leaving Mrs Arbuthnot room to say that she would be sorry to hold his views. During a discussion of sinful women, she also opposes Lady Hunstanton&#x27;s later opinion by saying that ruining a woman&#x27;s life is unforgivable. When Lady Hunstanton&#x27;s company finally breaks up, Lord Illingworth and Mrs Allonby leave to look at the Moon. Gerald attempts to follow, but his mother protests and ask him to take her home. Gerald says that he must first say goodbye to Lord Illingworth and also reveals that he will be going to India with him at the end of the month.

Mrs Arbuthnot is then left alone with Hester, and they resume the previous conversation about women. Mrs Arbuthnot is disgusted by Hester&#x27;s view that the sins of parents are suffered by their children. Recognising that Mrs Arbuthnot is waiting for her son to return, Hester decides to fetch Gerald. Gerald soon returns alone, however, and he becomes frustrated with his mother&#x27;s continued disapproval for what he sees as an opportunity to earn his mother&#x27;s respect and the love of Hester. Remembering Hester&#x27;s views, Mrs Arbuthnot decides to tell her son the truth about his origin and her past life with Lord Illingworth, but she does so in the third person, being sure to describe the despair that betrayed women face. Gerald remains unmoved, however, so Mrs Arbuthnot withdraws her objections. Hester then enters the room in anguish and flings herself into Gerald&#x27;s arms, exclaiming that Lord Illingworth has &quot;horribly insulted&quot; her. He has apparently tried to kiss her. Gerald almost attacks Illingworth in a rage when his mother stops him the only way she knows how: by telling him that Lord Illingworth is his father. With this revelation, Gerald takes his mother home, and Hester leaves on her own.

===Act IV===
;Sitting room in Mrs Arbuthnot&#x27;s House at Wrockley
Act IV opens with Gerald writing a letter in his mother&#x27;s sitting room, the contents of which will ask his father to marry Mrs Arbuthnot. Lady Hunstanton and Mrs Allonby are shown in, intending to visit Mrs Arbuthnot. The two comment on her apparent good taste and soon leave when the maid tells them that Mrs Arbuthnot has a headache and will not be able to see anyone. Gerald says that he has given up on being his father&#x27;s secretary, and he has sent for Lord Illingworth to come to his mother&#x27;s estate at 4 o&#x27;clock to ask for her hand in marriage. When Mrs Arbuthnot enters, Gerald tells her all that he has done and that he will not be his father&#x27;s secretary. Mrs Arbuthnot exclaims that his father must not enter her house, and the two argue over her marrying Gerald&#x27;s father. Gerald claims that the marriage is her duty, while Mrs Arbuthnot retains her integrity, saying that she will not make a mockery of marriage by marrying a man she despises. She also tells of how she devoted herself to the dishonour of being a single mother and has given her life to take care of her son. Hester overhears this conversation and runs to Mrs Arbuthnot. Hester says she has realised that the law of God is love and offers to use her wealth to take care of the man she loves and the mother she never had. After ensuring that Mrs Arbuthnot must live with them, Gerald and Hester leave to sit in the garden.

The maid announces the arrival of Lord Illingworth, who forces himself past the doorway and into the house. He approaches Mrs Arbuthnot, telling her that he has resolved to provide financial security and some property for Gerald. Mrs Arbuthnot merely shows him Gerald and Hester in the garden and tells Lord Illingworth that she no longer needs help from anyone but her son and his lover. Illingworth then sees Gerald&#x27;s unsealed letter and reads it. Lord Illingworth claims that while it would mean giving up his dream as a foreign ambassador, he is willing to marry Mrs Arbuthnot to be with his son. Mrs Arbuthnot refuses to marry him and tells Lord Illingworth that she hates him, adding that her hate for Illingworth and love for Gerald sharpen each other. She also assures Lord Illingworth that it was Hester who made Gerald despise him. Lord Illingworth then admits his defeat with the cold notion that Mrs Arbuthnot was merely his plaything for an affair, calling her his mistress. Mrs Arbuthnot then slaps him with his own glove before he can call Gerald his bastard.

Lord Illingworth, dazed and insulted, gathers himself and leaves after a final glance at his son. Mrs Arbuthnot falls onto the sofa sobbing. When Gerald and Hester enter, she cries out for Gerald, calling him her boy, and then asks Hester if she would have her as a mother. Hester assures her that she would. Gerald sees his father&#x27;s glove on the floor, and, when he asks who has visited, Mrs Arbuthnot replies, &quot;A man of no importance.&quot;

==Production history==

A production toured the British provinces in the latter part of 1893, with a cast headed by Lewis Waller as Lord Illingworth. After the first London run, the play was next seen in the West End when Tree staged a revival at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. The production ran for 45 performances from 22 May 1907; Tree again played Illingworth, Marion Terry played Mrs Arbuthnot, and the cast included Kate Cutler, Viola Tree, Charles Quartermaine and Ellis Jeffreys. The Liverpool Playhouse company presented the play during a London season in 1915. A revival at the Savoy Theatre in 1953 was, in the view of the critic J. C. Trewin, marred by cuts and inauthentic additions to Wilde&#x27;s text; Clive Brook was Illingworth and the cast included Athene Seyler, Jean Cadell, Isabel Jeans and William Mervyn. There were revivals at the Vaudeville Theatre, London (1967), the Chichester Festival (1978), the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (1996), the Barbican, London (1991) and the Haymarket (2003). A revival at the Vaudeville in 2017, starring Dominic Rowan and Eve Best, ran from October to December.

The Internet Broadway Database records two New York productions of &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;. Maurice Barrymore and Rose Coghlan played Illingworth and Mrs Arbuthnot in an 1893–94 production, and Holbrook Blinn and Margaret Anglin starred in the roles in 1916. Robert Brough and his company presented the first Australian production in 1897. Les Archives du spectacle record no performances of the play in France, in contrast with Wilde&#x27;s other three drawing room plays, which have all been staged in translation on various occasions.

==Critical reception==
The play was well received by the public, running from April to August 1893 – considered a good run for its time – but received mixed reviews. The reviewer in &quot; The Theatre&quot; thought it &quot;Not a play, but a stodge of Wilde, leavened by a pinch of human nature&quot;, redeemed only by superb acting that &quot;performs a miracle and provides compensation well-nigh sufficient for the disappointments of the play&quot;. &quot;The Era&quot; said, &quot;If &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; showed us Mr Oscar Wilde as a playwright at his best, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; exhibits all the vices of his method with irritating clearness&quot;. &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; complained of &quot;much want of originality in matter, and some want of originality in manner&quot;, but thought it &quot;a play with many strong situations, with much – indeed with too much – amusing dialogue&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; commented:

Reviewing the play in 1934, W. B. Yeats quoted Walter Pater&#x27;s comment that Wilde &quot;wrote like an excellent talker&quot;; Yeats agreed and found the verbal wit delightful, but the drama falling back on popular stage conventions. Reviewing a 1953 production, J. C. Trewin wrote, &quot;This revival proved once more that Wilde wrote one sustained play and one only: &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. Nothing else, I fear, matters&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s biographer Richard Ellmann has described &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; as the &quot;weakest of the plays Wilde wrote in the Nineties&quot;. After a 1991 revival, &quot;The Times&quot; called the play &quot;as fatuous a melodrama as ever eminent playwright penned&quot;. In 1997, Wilde&#x27;s biographer Peter Raby commented:
==Adaptations==
The play has been adapted for the cinema in at least four versions: British (1921), German (1936), French (1937) and Argentine (1945). The BBC has broadcast six adaptations of the play: one for television (1948) and five for radio (1924, 1949, 1955, 1960 and 1992). A 1960 television adaptation broadcast by Independent Television starred Griffith Jones and Gwen Watford as Illingworth and Mrs Arbuthnot.

<text>Marie Anett (born June 3, 1971, as Marie-Anett Mey) is a French model, entertainer, singer and musician born in Paris, France. She gained popularity success throughout the 1990s as the lead vocal performer of the German eurodance music group Fun Factory.

==Life and career==

===1971–92: Early life===
Mey is born on June 3, 1971, as Marie-Anett Mey in Paris, in France. She moved to Hamburg in Germany where she met her future fellow Fun Factory band member Toni Cottura.

===1993–94: Joining Fun Factory and &quot;Nonstop&quot;===

Before Fun Factory&#x27;s third single release &quot;Close to You&quot; in 1993, Mey replaced lead singer Balca Tözün, who left the band and joined surviving founding members Rodney Hardison, Toni Cottura and Stephan Browarczyk. With the second line-up, the band gained massive success, though it has been later revealed, that Tözün kept providing vocals in the background for all their later releases until their disbandment in 1997, with Mey just lip-syncing and performing with the group on stage. &quot;Close to You&quot; became their first chart success peaking #1 at the Canadian Dance chart. Follow-up singles were &quot;Take Your Chance&quot; and &quot;Pain&quot; being chart hits as well, peaking at #18 and #24 in the German Single chart, respectively. Fun Factory released their debut album &quot;Nonstop&quot; in 1994. Mey started her side project in 1994 with the band Darkness, a group fronted by her and rapper Nana. Their single &quot;In My Dreams&quot; was a hit, whose female vocals were also by Tözün.

===1995–97: &quot;Fun-Tastic&quot; and disbandment===
In 1995, Fun Factory released their singles &quot;I Wanna B with U&quot;, &quot;Celebration&quot; and the cover version of Manfred Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doh Wah Diddy&quot;, peaking at #11, #12 and #6 in the German Single chart. In 1995, Fun Factory released their second studio album &quot;Fun-Tastic&quot;. By this time they began to become more popular throughout Europe and even saw some of their songs to chart in the United States and Canada. The follow-up single release was &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot;, becoming their yet last moderate chart success. &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot; was also the last single to be promoted by the band as a quartet, when Cottura left the band. As a trio, the group released a last single, the ballad &quot;I Love You&quot;. When Hardison left Fun Factory to join Garcia in 1997, with whom he released three singles, the remaining two members Mey and Browarczyk were joined by the new member Ray Horton and planned to continue with a rebranded band name Fun Affairs, but had no success with it and Fun Factory split up. In 1997, a first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album has been released to end up the chapter.

===1998–2000: Other projects and Solo career===
In 2000, Mey briefly launched a musical solo career and released her first and only solo single &quot;Be the One&quot;. The single also included another song, the B-Side &quot;Light in My Life&quot;. A studio album hasn&#x27;t been realized.

===2001–Present: Music retirement and other ventures===
Mey became a make-up artist for the worldwide known make-up company MAC Cosmetics.

<text>Inuit Ataqatigiit (, old spelling: , , , IA) is a democratic socialist, pro-independence political party in Greenland. It is represented in the Folketing (the Danish parliament) by Aaja Chemnitz Larsen. Múte B. Egede has been the party&#x27;s leader since December 2018.

== History ==
The party was founded as a political organisation in 1976, born out of the increased youth radicalism in Denmark during the 1970s.

In 1982, the party successfully campaigned in a national referendum for Greenland to leave the European Economic Community (EEC).

Inuit Ataqatigiit made a major electoral breakthrough in the 2009 Greenlandic parliamentary election. Making gains from the 2005 Greenlandic parliamentary election, it doubled its total number of seats in the Parliament from seven to 14 seats out of 31, just two seats short of a majority, and nearly doubled its total vote share from 22.4% to 43.7%. It supplanted both its coalition partners, shifting the Forward party from first to second and the Democrats party from second to third. At the 2014 elections, the party obtained 11 members in the Greenlandic parliament, but after elections in 2018, their share decreased to eight seats. Following the 2021 elections, Inuit Ataqatigiit once again became the largest party in the Greenlandic parliament, with 12 seats.

== Ideology ==
The party has traditionally been in favour of a socialist economy, but parties to its left have criticised it for having gradually moved towards a capitalist approach, supporting a market economy and privatisation. Inuit Ataqatigiit believes that an independent Greenland should be competitive while fighting to keep the environment clean.

<text>The Guinea-Bissau War of Independence (), also known as the Bissau-Guinean War of Independence, was an armed independence conflict that took place in Portuguese Guinea from 1963 to 1974. It was fought between Portugal and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (&quot;Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde,&quot; PAIGC), an armed independence movement backed by Cuba, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Brazil. The war is commonly referred to as &quot;Portugal&#x27;s Vietnam&quot; because it was a protracted guerrilla war which had extremely high costs in men and material and which created significant internal political turmoil in Portugal.

After the assassination of PAIGC leader Amílcar Cabral in January 1973, the military conflict reached a stalemate: Portuguese forces were largely confined to major cities and various fortified bases and were patently unable to dislodge PAIGC from the so-called liberated zones. In September 1973, the PAIGC-dominated People&#x27;s National Assembly unilaterally declared the independence of a new Republic of Guinea-Bissau; the declaration was recognised by several foreign countries. After the Carnation Revolution, the new Portuguese government agreed to grant independence to Guinea-Bissau in September 1974 and to Cape Verde a year later. PAIGC thus became the first sub-Saharan African liberation movement to achieve independence – if only indirectly – through armed struggle.

==Background==
=== Portuguese colonialism ===
Portuguese Guinea (as well as the nearby Portuguese Cape Verde archipelago) had been claimed as a Portuguese territory since 1446 and was a major trading post for commodities and African slaves during the 18th century. However, the mainland was not fully &quot;pacified&quot; until the late 1930s, by which time the Portuguese regime of António de Oliveira Salazar was preoccupied with the development of its Angolan and Mozambican colonies. There were various changes to the colonies&#x27; legal status and governance structures during this period and in subsequent decades, but they were primarily &quot;cosmetic&quot; in effect.

In the phrase of Patrick Chabal, Guinea was &quot;the smallest and most backward of the Portuguese colonies&quot;, partly due to its inhospitable climate and apparent dearth of natural and mineral resources. There were few European settlers in Guinea, and the footprint even of the Portuguese administration was minimal and &quot;crude&quot;, remaining centralised under the governor. Portugal invested little in the colony and made only minor gestures towards promoting its economic and social development. Nonetheless, a colonial economy existed on the Guinean mainland, controlled primarily by the Companhia União Fabril and consisting primarily of cash crop exports; traditional Guinean economies were disrupted both by the imperative to cultivate export crops and by Portuguese taxation. Moreover, Portugal was attached even to its most &quot;dispensable&quot; colony, viewing its maintenance as integral to Portugal&#x27;s hold on other more economically important colonies, particularly Angola and Mozambique. 

=== Formation of PAIGC ===
The revolutionary insurgency which ultimately launched the war was led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (Portuguese: &quot;Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde,&quot; PAIGC), a liberation movement founded in 1956 by Rafael Barbosa and nationalist intellectual Amílcar Cabral. From the outset, its main objectives were the unity of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde and their independence from Portuguese rule. In its first three years, PAIGC was preoccupied with mostly fruitless exercises in constitutional-legal agitation, concentrated in Bissau and other major cities and sometimes involving collaboration with local trade unions. However, on 3 August 1959, PAIGC was involved in organising a major dockworkers&#x27; strike at the Port of Bissau. The Portuguese authorities broke up the strike by force, leading to what became known as the Pidjiguiti massacre, in which at least fifty people were killed and several hundreds wounded. 

The massacre led PAIGC to rethink its policies: in the aftermath, it reiterated its commitment to national liberation, but with a new emphasis on the political mobilisation of the rural peasantry. Cabral ordered the party to go underground and its political cadres to organise in exile in Conakry, the capital of the newly independent Republic of Guinea on the southern border of Portuguese Guinea. Between 1960 and 1963, PAIGC was &quot;totally transformed&quot; as it prepared for armed struggle against the Portuguese regime. Scores of cadres were trained in Conakry and sent to the Guinean countryside to mobilise the population, while the political leadership launched a diplomatic offensive that secured the full cooperation of the government in Conakry, the &quot;tacit support&quot; of the Senegalese government, and contacts with several other liberation movements and left-wing political parties.

On April 18, 1961 PAIGC together with FRELIMO of Mozambique, MPLA of Angola and MLSTP of São Tomé and Príncipe formed the Conference of Nationalist Organizations of the Portuguese Colonies (CONCP) during a conference in Morocco. The main goal of the organization was cooperation among the different national liberation movements in the Portuguese Empire. Also in 1961 PAIGC commenced sabotage operations in Guinea-Bissau. At the start of hostilities the Portuguese had only two infantry companies in Guinea Bissau and these concentrated in the main towns, giving the insurgents free rein in the countryside. The PAIGC blew up bridges, cut telegraph lines, destroyed sections of the highways, established arms caches and hideouts, and destroyed Fula villages and minor administrative posts. In late 1962 the Portuguese launched an offensive and evicted the PAIGC cadres that had not integrated with the local population. Open hostilities broke out in January 1963.

== Belligerents and forces ==

=== Liberation/PAIGC forces ===
Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s liberation movement was led and dominated by PAIGC, which was led by Cabral until his assassination in January 1973. By the early 1970s, PAIGC had the support of a majority of the Guinean population, but its combat strength was estimated at no more than 7,000. However, the movement was &quot;well trained, well led, and well equipped&quot;, and its guerrilla campaign benefitted both from the terrain – its forces operated primarily from Guinea&#x27;s dense jungles – and from external support. 

==== Organisation ====
In 1964, PAIGC held its Cassaca Congress, which decided on reforms to discourage militarism inside the organisation. Thereafter the war effort was carried out not by autonomous guerrilla groups, but by guerrilla units within a nationwide army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People (&quot;Forças Armadas Revolucionárias do Povo,&quot; FARP). From then until the close of the war, the basic fighting unit in FARP was the highly flexible &quot;double group&quot; (&quot;bi-grupo&quot;), which comprised two distinct commandos of 15 to 25 men each, normally operating together but also capable of remaining operational if separated (or if joined with other double groups). Also from 1964, PAIGC implemented what Chabal calls a &quot;dual command&quot; at all levels of its military apparatus: at every level, leadership was exercised jointly by two men, one military commander and one political commissar. 
==== External support ====
Senegalese President Léopold Sédar Senghor was generally pro-Western and he cooperated closely with Portuguese leaders in attempting to broker a political solution to the conflict. (Brazil, itself a former Portuguese colony, also offered to mediate.) At the same time, however, Senegal provided safe haven to PAIGC from 1966, when Senghor&#x27;s government formally agreed to allow PAIGC soldiers free movement in and out of Senegal, where PAIGC would be allowed to establish bases. Simultaneously, PAIGC retained its headquarters-in-exile in Guinea-Conakry, Guinea&#x27;s other neighbour and a continued ally of PAIGC.

Elsewhere in Africa, PAIGC received material support from Libya, then under Muammar Gaddafi, and from the new revolutionary government of Algeria. A Marxist organisation operating at the height of the Cold War, it was also supported, from the early 1960s, by socialist states further afield, including the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. Between 1966 and 1974, PAIGC was supported by the government of Fidel Castro in Cuba, which deployed a handful of doctors, military instructors, and technicians to PAIGC camps. Cuban soldiers saw some limited combat while in Guinea, but the Cuban military mission was small – it averaged 50–60 men at any time, primarily artillerymen – and Cabral declined its repeated offers to take a more active role in combat. Other Eastern Bloc countries – Poland, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Romania – &quot;engaged minimally&quot; with PAIGC, providing limited non-military support in the form of propaganda support and scholarships for technical training and political education. A similar dynamic adhered in PAIGC&#x27;s relationships with Yugoslavia and Sweden. Between mid-1969 and mid-1975 PAIGC received 45.2 million Swedish kronor in aid from the Swedish state, representing two-thirds of the Swedish assistance to African liberation movements during this period. Sweden was the most important donor of non-military material for PAIGC during the latter phase of the liberation war.

Finally, PAIGC received significant support from the Bissau-Guinean diaspora, which burgeoned as a result of mass displacement during a 1964 PAIGC offensive and during Portuguese bombing campaigns in 1965 and 1967. By 1970, an estimated 106,000 Guineans – almost 20 per cent of the territory&#x27;s population – had fled the war and relocated to the neighbouring states of Guinea-Conakry and Senegal. These migrant populations, particularly those resident in border regions, provided PAIGC forces with refuge and helped PAIGC soldiers to move regular shipments of weapons from Guinea-Conakry and Senegal into Portuguese Guinea. On a monthly basis, materiel was trucked from Koundara, Guinea-Conakry into Senegalese towns, including Vélingara, where pro-PAIGC forces maintained a warehouse, and then was transported across the border on foot.

=== Portuguese Armed Forces ===
PAIGC was countered by the colonial army of the Portuguese Armed Forces stationed in Guinea, which proliferated in the early years of the war. For most of the war, from 1968 until August 1973, General António de Spínola was both governor and military commander in Portuguese Guinea, succeeding General Arnaldo Schultz in both capacities. The strength of his forces in Guinea was estimated at between 31,000 and 32,000 in 1974, and the forces comprised both metropolitan soldiers and locally recruited Guineans.
==== Africanization ====
The &quot;Africanization&quot; of the war effort by Portugal, also pursued in the Angolan and Mozambican theatres, proceeded with particular speed in Guinea, particularly after General Spínola&#x27;s appointment. It entailed the integration of indigenous Guinean Africans into the Portuguese military forces which fought PAIGC. Until the 1950s, the Portuguese military forces permanently stationed in Guinea included a small force of locally recruited African colonial soldiers (&quot;caçadores indigenas&quot;), commanded by white officers; non-commissioned officers were a mixture of whites, overseas soldiers (African &quot;assimilados&quot;), and native or indigenous Africans (&quot;indigenato&quot;). Spínola planned – and fought with Lisbon – to abolish the distinction between and discrimination among metropolitan soldiers and local recruits, undertaking instead to create a regular and coherent African army whose structure mirrored that of the metropolitan army.

Africanization fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces. By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as non-commissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa. Elite local troops were trained at Portuguese Centres for Commando Instruction, including inside Guinea, where the first such centre was established in 1964, but in many cases in Angola. The Portuguese forces recruited Africans mainly from among the populations of the territories they controlled. In particular, members of the Fulbe ethnic group were over-represented in the Portuguese army, partly because many Fulbe lived in eastern regions which were controlled by Portugal until late in the war and where local chiefs had &quot;generally amicable&quot; relationships with the Portuguese. Portuguese recruitment was also assisted by colonial propaganda, coercion, and the offer of salaries to conscripts.

Under Spínola, the Portuguese also created two elite special forces contingents composed of African combatants and engaged in counterinsurgency. The Special Marines (&quot;Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos&quot;) were created in 1970 and by 1974 numbered 160 men in two detachments; they supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea which attempted to interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. The more prominent African Commandos (&quot;Comandos Africanos&quot;) began operating in 1972 and comprised 700 men in three battalions by 1974. The African Commandos were manned entirely by Africans and carried out special combat operations in neighbouring Senegal and Guinea-Conakry as well as inside Portuguese Guinea. The Commandos were especially well known for carrying out helicoptered commando raids on so-called liberated villages under PAIGC control – Spínola&#x27;s &quot;version of the US Army&#x27;s &#x27;search and destroy&#x27; operations in Vietnam&quot; – and in liberated areas they were &quot;widely hated for their brutality and ruthlessness&quot;.

In addition, at the outset of the war, Portugal recruited local militias – 18 companies by 1966 – to organise the &quot;self-defence&quot; of local populations, thus freeing the expeditionary army for offensive operations. Once Spínola was appointed, recruiting selectively from among the existing militias, created Special Militias of local combatants organised in combat groups, structured similarly to the Portuguese army (in companies divided into platoons), and operating fairly autonomously. In 1968, he proposed to create five such Special Militias, but Lisbon had authorised only two by 1970, concerned both about financial constraints and about the &quot;informality of procedures&quot; introduced by Africanization.

According to post-war estimates, locally recruited troops in Guinea numbered 1,000 in 1961 (21.1% of all Portuguese troops there), 3,229 (14.9%) in 1967, and 6,425 (20.1%) in 1973. Many thousands more locals were included in Portuguese-aligned militias. In all, there were &quot;at least on paper, upwards of 17,000&quot; African fighters in Guinea; on one estimate, upon the eve of the Portuguese withdrawal in 1974, the total Portuguese force in the territory numbered about 31,000 fighters, of whom 24,800 were black and 6,200 white.

== Conflict (1963–1974) ==
=== Initial PAIGC gains: 1963–1967 ===
PAIGC officially launched its armed struggle inside Guinea in early 1963, despite difficult conditions and very limited weapons supplies. PAIGC cadres, stationed south of the Geba River estuary, attacked Portuguese garrisons in Tite and Catió – bases deliberately established in the middle of PAIGC strongholds to serve as bases for surveillance and counter-insurgency. Similar guerrilla attacks were launched throughout the south of Portuguese Guinea, and the conflict spread. Chabal notes that the attacks surprised the Portuguese authorities, who had expected PAIGC to launch cross-border attacks in incursions over the border with Guinea-Conakry, rather than to launch a guerrilla war inside the territory, and who suffered high casualties early on. According to Chabal, PAIGC&#x27;s strategy was for small groups of guerrillas gradually to gain a foothold in areas where they had popular political support, while seeking &quot;to attack and harass the Portuguese everywhere and at all times, to cut all means of transport and communications and isolate them in the fortified areas where they had to retreat&quot;. Its policy, moreover, was never to attempt to take over an area until PAIGC guerrillas had guaranteed the support of the local population there. PAIGC intended always to avoid frontal attack or confrontation with the Portuguese forces, who were better equipped; it envisioned the war ending with PAIGC gradually moving its guerrilla war from the countryside towards the cities, which it would encircle rather than seize.

By July 1963, PAIGC had consolidated its military position in the southern littoral, and had also gained &quot;a tenuous foothold&quot; in the Mansôa–Mansaba–Oio triangle, north of the Geba estuary. Thus, at a five-day conference the same month, PAIGC commanders agreed to redouble their efforts on the northern front. 

The geography, dense forests with numerous waterways, were favourable to guerrilla activity. The PAIGC had few weapons – perhaps only one submachine gun and two pistols per group – so attacked Portuguese convoys to gain more weapons. Each group fought in isolation and established a forest based hideout independently from the others. Many groups were formed on tribal and religious grounds. These groups began to abuse the locals and people began to flee the “liberated” zones. The central PAIGC command were horrified and considered this military “commandism”. Around October 1963 the Portuguese began to retaliate against PAIGC activity with bomber raids; by the end of 1963 some villages had been abandoned as the occupants took to the forest.

In 1964 PAIGC opened their second front in the north. In April 1964 the Portuguese launched a counter-offensive. They attacked the PAIGC held island of Como in the south of the country. 3,000 Portuguese, with air support, were involved but after 65 days were forced to withdraw. The PAIGC harassed the Portuguese during the rainy season. At some point in 1964 Portuguese Air Force planners failed to verify their target and bombed Portuguese troops. In retaliation Portuguese soldiers and sailors attacked the squadron barracks in the colony&#x27;s capital Bissau.

In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of the country; that same year the PAIGC expanded its attacks in the northern area of the country, where at the time only the &quot;Front for the Liberation and Independence of Guinea&quot; (FLING), a minor insurgent force, was operating. By this time, the PAIGC, led by Amílcar Cabral, began openly receiving military support from the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba.

The success of PAIGC guerilla operations forced the &quot;Exército Português do Ultramar&quot; (Portuguese overseas armed forces) deployed in Portuguese Guinea on the defensive at an early stage; the latter were forced to limit their response to defending territories and cities already held. Unlike Portugal&#x27;s other African territories, successful small-unit Portuguese counterinsurgency tactics were slow to evolve in Guinea. Defensive operations, where soldiers were dispersed in small numbers to guard critical buildings, farms, or infrastructure were particularly devastating to the regular Portuguese infantry, who became vulnerable to guerrilla attacks outside of populated areas by the forces of the PAIGC.

They were also demoralized by the steady growth of PAIGC liberation sympathizers and recruits among the rural population. In a relatively short time, the PAIGC had succeeded in reducing Portuguese military and administrative control of the country to a relatively small area of Guinea. The scale of this success can be seen in the fact that native Guineans in the &#x27;liberated territories&#x27; ceased payment of debts to Portuguese landowners as well as payment of taxes to the colonial administration.

The branch stores of the Companhia União Fabril (CUF), &quot;Mario Lima Whanon&quot;, and &quot;Manuel Pinto Brandão&quot; companies were seized and inventoried by the PAIGC in the areas they controlled, while the use of Portuguese currency in the areas under guerilla control was banned. In order to maintain the economy in the liberated territories, the PAIGC was compelled at an early stage to establish its own Marxist administrative and governmental bureaucracy, which organized agricultural production, educated farm workers on protecting crops from destruction from government attacks, and opened collective &quot;armazéns do povo&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s stores&quot;) to supply urgently needed tools and supplies in exchange for agricultural produce. By 1967 the PAIGC had carried out 147 attacks on Portuguese barracks and army encampments, and effectively controlled 2/3 of Portuguese Guinea.

The next year, Portugal began a new campaign against the guerrillas with the arrival of the new governor of the colony, General António de Spínola. General Spínola instituted a series of civil and military reforms, intended to first contain, then roll back the PAIGC and its control of much of the rural portion of Portuguese Guinea. This included a &#x27;hearts and minds&#x27; propaganda campaign designed to win the trust of the indigenous population, an effort to eliminate some of the discriminatory practices against native Guineans, a massive construction campaign for public works including new schools, hospitals, improved telecommunications and road networks, and a large increase in recruitment of native Guineans into the Portuguese armed forces serving in Guinea as part of an &quot;Africanisation&quot; strategy. The Portuguese conducted many search and destroy operations against the PAIGC 20 km from the frontier. On one occasion five helicopters landed 50 white plus some African soldiers. Thirty-six FARP men under Bobo, commander of the Sambuya zone, drew the Portuguese forces into a wooded area. Bobo launched an ambush at 1700 hours, inflicted casualties, and forced the Portuguese to withdraw. The PAIGC claimed the Portuguese suffered five dead and several wounded against their own four wounded.

In 1966 the Portuguese attempted four large unsuccessful search-and-destroy sweeps of Iracunda. Each included several hundred conscripts with automatic weapons, mortars, bazookas, and air support. Warned by the peasants or by their own reconnaissance patrols, the PAIGC pulled back, loosely encircled the Portuguese, and launched night attacks to break up the column. The insurgents would sometimes feint at the end of the line to distract attention from the main attack elsewhere. The PAIGC considered the conscripts inept in the jungle.

In Mar 1968 the PAIGC conducted an attack against the main Portuguese airfield just outside Bissau. The airfield was protected by wire, minefields and blockhouses. Thirteen volunteers infiltrated to the edge of the field and fired into the base, damaging planes on the ground, hangars, and other installations. They then withdrew with no casualties.

The Portuguese stationed an infantry company at Madina do Boé in the east near the border with Guinea. With few inhabitants and structures to protect, and a long permeable frontier to guard, the company ended up just protecting themselves. Despite the fact there was no real benefit to keeping them there, the authorities refused to withdraw the unit until 1969. As feared, the PAIGC used the withdrawal as a PR opportunity with foreign journalists.

In mid-1969 the PAIGC launched Operation Tenaz against Portuguese positions around Bafata, north of the River Corubal. They started by secretly depositing ammunition in dumps to the rear of areas of engagement. Reconnaissance was provided by two bi-groups that infiltrated the area to discover the Portuguese dispositions. Then two strike forces of several hundred men entered the area.

===Tactical changes===

Military tactical reforms by Portuguese commanders included new naval amphibious operations to overcome some of the mobility problems inherent in the underdeveloped and marshy areas of the country. These new operations utilized &quot;Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE)&quot; (special marine assault detachments) as strike forces. The &quot;Fuzileiros Especiais&quot; were lightly equipped with folding-stock m/961 (G3) rifles, 37mm rocket launchers, and light machine guns such as the Heckler &amp; Koch HK21 to enhance their mobility in the difficult, swampy terrain.

Between 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces increased their offensive posture, in the form of raids into PAIGC-controlled territory. At this time Portuguese forces also adopted unorthodox means of countering the insurgents, including attacks on the political structure of the nationalist movement. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to increase its strength, and began to heavily press Portuguese defense forces.
In 1970 the Portuguese Air Force (FAP) began to use weapons similar to those the US was using in the Vietnam War: napalm and defoliants in order to find the insurgents or at least deny them the cover and concealment needed for rebel ambushes. 

In general, the PAIGC in Guinea was the best armed, trained, and led of all the guerrilla movements. After 1968 PAIGC forces were increasingly supplied with modern Soviet weapons and equipment, most notably SA-7 rocket launchers and radar-controlled AA cannons. These weapons effectively undermined Portuguese air superiority, preventing the destruction by air of PAIGC encampments in territory it controlled. By 1970 the PAIGC even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly MIGs and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious assault crafts and APCs.

Considerable support to the PAIGC from Yugoslavia began in after 1968, in the form of military equipment, tactical, technical, and political training for PAIGC leadership, and medical aid. Yugoslavia also built a well-equipped hospital in Boké for PAIGC fighters, which was staffed by both Yugoslav and Cuban doctors, which was the flagship of the PAIGC health services.

=== Invasion of Guinea: November 1970 ===

In late November 1970, Portugal launched Operation Green Sea, an amphibious attack on Guinea-Conakry designed to capture the PAIGC leadership, including Cabral, and to topple Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré, ideally to be replaced by a leader more willing to cooperate with the Portuguese and to obstruct PAIGC&#x27;s supply lines. Chabal views the operation as &quot;ill-timed and ill-prepared&quot; and as &quot;desperate&quot;: the Portuguese operatives were dispersed and expelled from Conakry, and, having revivified Third World political support for PAIGC, the misadventure strained Portuguese relations with other Western countries. The United Nations (UN) Security Council unanimously condemned the operation in Resolution 290, and the following year passed Resolution 291 condemning other cross-border incursions by Portugal into Guinea.

Over the next two years, Portugal failed to make military advances or to forestall the consolidation of PAIGC&#x27;s advances. By the beginning of 1972, although territorial boundaries remained blurry, most of the country belonged to one of PAIGC&#x27;s liberated zones; by the end of the year, a &quot;de facto&quot; balance of power or even &quot;situation of routine&quot; had developed between Portuguese and PAIGC forces. Meanwhile, however, PAIGC had launched a flurry of political activity – having judged in roughly 1971 that independence was feasible and even imminent, its leadership had begun preparing for independence, including by creating new domestic political structures (with elections held in 1972) and by conducting an intense diplomatic offensive abroad.

=== Assassination of Amílcar Cabral: January 1973 ===
After years of attempts by Portugal to attack or capture Cabral as a means of undermining PAIGC&#x27;s organizational structure, Cabral was assassinated on 20 January 1973 in Conakry, by disgruntled PAIGC members. PAIGC purged the traitors, and regrouped under the joint leadership of Aristides Pereira and Luís Cabral, Amílcar&#x27;s half-brother. 

Rather than disabling the group, the assassination of PAIGC&#x27;s leader was followed by some of its most ambitious offensives, as it destroyed or took over key Portuguese positions in the north and on the southern border. Having acquired new weaponry, and in particular new ground-to-air missiles, PAIGC began in March 1973 to attack with vigour the Portuguese Air Force, &quot;effectively neutralising&quot; Portugal&#x27;s air superiority – which until then had been Portugal&#x27;s most marked tactical advantage, and a significant one given Guinea&#x27;s difficult ground terrain. As PAIGC deployed its new ground-to-air missiles, as well as new large-caliber mortars and rockets (reportedly from Soviet-bloc suppliers), the war &quot;increasingly took on a &#x27;conventional&#x27; rather than guerrilla character&quot;. In July 1973, PAIGC artillery destroyed the important Portuguese strongpoint of Guileje, which previously had been held by an elite garrison of 400 mostly European troops and which had presented a major obstacle to PAIGC&#x27;s communications with the government in Guinea-Conakry. By then, Portuguese forces were largely confined to the major cities and a diminished collection of fortified camps, and the Portuguese strategy increasingly amounted to little more than – in the phrase of Portuguese officer Major Carlos Fabião – &quot;holding on as best as possible&quot; (&quot;aguentar enquanto fosse possível&quot;). It launched no further offensives in the war.

== End of Portuguese rule in Guinea ==
=== Unilateral independence: September 1973 ===
On 23–24 September 1973, the People&#x27;s National Assembly (&quot;Assembleia Nacional Popular de Guiné&quot;) met in Madina do Boé, near the border with Guinea-Conakry, and declared the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The Assembly comprised 120 delegates, overwhelmingly from PAIGC, who had been appointed following elections held by PAIGC in 1972 in the so-called liberated zones – areas which PAIGC controlled with little Portuguese interference. During the Boé congress, the Assembly also nominated Luís Cabral as president at the head of a fifteen-member council of state. 

Spínola and other Portuguese commanders told the press that the liberated zones were a myth, that the entire territory remained under the control of Portuguese forces, and that the declaration of independence had been issued outside Guinea. Nonetheless, before the end of the year, the new Republic of Guinea-Bissau had been recognised by at least 57 states. On 2 November, the UN General Assembly passed, by 93 votes to seven, a resolution which welcomed &quot;the recent accession to independence of the people of Guinea-Bissau&quot;, recognised the state&#x27;s sovereignty, condemned Portugal&#x27;s continued presence in parts of the territory, and called on the UN Security Council to take &quot;all effective steps to restore the territorial integrity of the Republic&quot;.

=== Algiers accord: August 1974 ===
Evidence published by the Portuguese newspaper &quot;Expresso&quot; in 1994 suggests that the Portuguese regime held secret diplomatic talks with PAIGC in London on 26–27 March 1974. However, diplomatic progress accelerated the following month, when the regime was overthrown in a military coup during the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974. The war in Guinea-Bissau has been viewed as a factor which contributed to the coup and revolution: its status as &quot;the most intense, destructive, and materially pointless&quot; of the three Portuguese wars in Africa rendered it an embarrassment to the outgoing regime; and the coup was organised by the left-wing Armed Forces Movement (&quot;Movimento das Forças Armadas&quot;), the core of which &quot;took shape&quot; first among military officers in Guinea-Bissau. Spínola, who had been at the head of the Portuguese effort in Guinea-Bissau, himself became president of the new National Salvation Junta.

In May, the new Portuguese government agreed to negotiate with PAIGC. With the assistance of the British Foreign Office, meetings between PAIGC and the new Portuguese regime were held on 25–31 May 1974 at the Hyde Park Hotel in London. The talks reached deadlock over sequencing, as PAIGC insisted that Portugal should recognise the 1973 declaration of independence as a precondition for the ceasefire sought by Portugal. However, the parties reconvened later in Algiers, Algeria, which PAIGC regarded as a more &quot;comfortable&quot; environment than London. Meanwhile, Portuguese troops in the field in Guinea-Bissau established informal contacts with PAIGC troops; and, on 29 July, the territorial assembly of the Portuguese Armed Forces Movement issued a declaration which applauded the anti-colonial &quot;struggle for national liberation&quot; and described PAIGC as &quot;the sole legitimate representative of the people of Guinea-Bissau&quot;. On 26 August 1974, in Algiers, Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in which Portugal agreed to recognise Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s independence and to remove all troops by the end of October. Also in August, the UN Security Council recommended Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s admission into the UN.

=== Portuguese withdrawal: September 1974 ===
According to Basil Davidson, a &quot;de facto&quot; ceasefire had already obtained in Guinea-Bissau since the Carnation Revolution, disturbed only once by a mild exchange of gunfire on 27 May, which had been precipitated by &quot;a mutual confusion&quot;. Indeed, a semi-formal withdrawal of Portuguese troops began before the Algiers accord was signed, with 41 camps evacuated by 24 August. The core 600 African Special Commandos were demobilised on 20 August. 

As stipulated in the Algiers accord, Portugal granted full independence to Guinea-Bissau on September 10, 1974, after over eleven years of armed conflict. Historian Norrie McQueen notes that the accord and its implementation preserved an ambiguity with respect to the legal status of the withdrawal – that is, as to whether it constituted a negotiated transfer of power, or a belated recognition of the 1973 declaration of independence. Nonetheless, by the time the Portuguese withdrawal was completed later in September, the independence of Guinea-Bissau &quot;had been established beyond any political or legal debate&quot;. The neighbouring Cape Verde archipelago, which also formerly belonged to Portuguese Guinea, attained independence in 1975 as the Republic of Cabo Verde.

== Aftermath ==
With the coming of independence, the PAIGC moved swiftly to extend its control throughout the country. A Marxist one-party state controlled by the PAIGC and headed by Luís Cabral was established. Indigenous troops who had served with the Portuguese Army were given the choice of either returning home with their families while receiving full pay until the end of December 1974, or of joining the PAIGC military. A total of 7,447 black African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando units, security forces, and the armed militia decided not to join the new ruling party and were summarily executed by the PAIGC after Portuguese forces ceased hostilities.

<text>Máirtín Ó Direáin (; 29 November 1910 – 19 March 1988) was an Irish poet from the Aran Islands Gaeltacht. Along with Seán Ó Ríordáin and Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Ó Direáin was, in the words of Louis de Paor, &quot;one of a trinity of poets who revolutionised Irish language poetry in the 1940s and 50s.&quot; According to a 1984 lecture by Desmond Egan, &quot;Ó Direáin&#x27;s genius stands revealed - to the extent that we must look abroad for poets with whom his achievement might best be compared; to Spain and Antonio Machado&#x27;s sweet intensity; to Russia and Akhmatova; to Germany and the bittersweet music of Heinrich Heine.&quot;

==Biography==
Ó Direáin was born in Sruthán on Inis Mór in the Aran Islands and was the eldest of the three sons and one daughter of Seán Ó Direáin and Mairéad Ní Dhireáin of Inis Mór. As was still common in the West of Ireland at the time, Ó Direáin grew up as a monoglot and spoke only Connacht Irish until his mid-teens. His father died prematurely in 1917 and left his widow with four children and less than 20 acres of farmland. Ó Direáin was educated at Onaght national school. 

Like many other writers, poets, and intellectuals of the post-Irish War of Independence era, Ó Direáin chose to make a career in the Irish civil service. He worked first for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in Galway City from 1928 to 1937, where Ó Direáin also served as the secretary of the city&#x27;s chapter of Conradh na Gaeilge and sometime times also acted in Irish language stage plays. While living in Galway City, Ó Direáin also wrote an Irish-language stage play about the life of Russian Symbolist poet Alexander Blok for the Taibhdhearc theatre run by Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards.

Ó Direáin then lived and worked in Dublin, first for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and then Department of Education, among, &quot;the scurrying Lilliputians of the metropolis, the &quot;seangánfhir&quot;, or ant-people&quot;, from 1937 until 1975. After hearing a lecture in 1938 by prominent Gaelic revival poet and writer Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, Ó Direáin decided, by his own account, to dedicate his life to Modern literature in Irish and began writing poetry. Muiris Mac Conghail later disagreed in a 1988 article about his late friend, as he believed that Ó Direáin was already planning to be a poet even when he was still a child upon Inishmore.

At this time, Tadhg Ó Donnchadha and many other Gaelic revivalists like him favoured reviving both the Classical Gaelic literary language and Dán Díreach; the strict metres. Both had been traditionally used in the Irish bardic poetry composed in both Gaelic Ireland and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and continued to be widely understood in both countries for at least a century after the bardic schools were closed down in the 17th-century. Instead of taking this approach, Ó Direáin, joined a few years later by fellow poets Seán Ó Ríordáin and Máire Mhac an tSaoi, spearheaded a revival of Modernist poetry, which had been lying dormant in Irish language verse since the execution by firing squad of Patrick Pearse following the Easter Rising in 1916.

Similarly to Ó Ríordáin and Mhac an tSaoi, Ó Direáin preferred using the Modern Irish he had grown up speaking in a living Gaeltacht community instead of older forms of the language. Ó Direáin differed radically from Mhac an tSaoi, however, who sometimes wrote Dán Díreach in the living Munster Irish dialect spoken around Dun Chaoin, in that he preferred emulating T.S. Eliot and writing poetry in rhythmically measured, but more loose and experimental verse forms inspired by the &quot;Amhrán&quot; metre oral poetry and Sean Nós songs he had learned in the ceilidh houses as a child upon Inishmore. The results were nothing less than revolutionary.

Ó Direáin published his first two poetry collections at his own expense in 1942 and 1943. In 1949, his selected poems became one of the first books published by Sáirséal agus Dill, a new publishing house for Modern literature in Irish.

Ó Direáin&#x27;s early poetry celebrated the traditional cultural life he had known upon the Aran Islands and lamented both its passing and the mass migration to Ireland&#x27;s major cities. One of his best-known poems, &quot;Stoite&quot; (&quot;Uprooted&quot;), contrasts traditional Irish rural life in union with seasonal rhythms and ancestral culture with the drab existence of urban civil servants and office workers. At the same time, as his poetry and other writings also reveal, Ó Direáin enjoyed, at least to an extent, the Irish-speaking literary and cultural life of both Galway City and Dublin.

While Ó Direáin was rooted deeply in the literature and oral tradition of Gaelic Ireland, his poetry also shows influence from throughout world literature. For example, Ó Direáin drew inspiration from both T.S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats, whose, &quot;antipathy for &#x27;the filthy modern tide&#x27;&quot;, matched his own. Even when delivering public lectures in the Irish language, Ó Direáin often quoted extensively from the poetry and essays of Eliot, in the original English.

From the literature of the Germanosphere, the philosophy of both Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler further influenced Ó Direáin&#x27;s, &quot;apocalyptic sense of a civilisation in terminal decline.&quot; Another favorite modern writer who influenced Ó Direáin deeply was anti-communist Russian political refugee and philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev.

In a radical difference from the rejection of Catholic teaching on human sexuality found even during the 1950s in the poetry of Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Ó Direáin&#x27;s poetry, both during and after the Emergency in Dublin, repeatedly displays the horror he felt as he witnessed the escalating collapse of Christian morality, the growing number of, &quot;emasculated men&quot; and the similar loss of feminity in women. Ó Direáin considered all three trends to be rooted in the (), or &quot;Uprootedness&quot;, of Irish culture and Irish people in long English-speaking parts of the country.

Ó Direáin also went on the record as a harsh critic of feminism, but during an interview for the documentary &quot;An Carraig Stoite&quot;, a female Irish civil service colleague described Ó Direáin as a man who was always very gentlemanly towards his female coworkers. She described the Irish civil service of the era as an extremely depressing career for people of both genders.

During the same documentary, Ó Direáin&#x27;s daughter, Niamh Ní Dhireáin, recalled the very deep love that her parents felt for each other and that the happiest times of her father&#x27;s day were always after coming home to his family. Ó Direáin&#x27;s vocal anti-feminism was accordingly rooted in his own preference for time with his family and his hatred of working in an urban office. 

In an interview published posthumously, Ó Direáin went on the record saying that he thought women who chose to build their whole life around their job were either very foolish or very controlling in a manner he had often seen among male careerists. No one, he explained, should work a day job if they had another and better option. He also said, though, that he firmly believed that women who did the same job as men deserved to be paid the same wage.

He also published poetry eulogizing Grace O&#x27;Malley and the courage and the sacrifices made in the name of Irish republicanism by women during both the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence.

In 1952, Ó Direáin translated a play by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy for Radio Eireann; the play was called &quot;The King of Spain&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (translated as &quot;Iníon Rí na Spáinne&quot;).

Ó Direáin&#x27;s lifelong adherence to traditionalist conservatism, Roman Catholicism, Irish republicanism, and the anti-colonialist values of Official Ireland, further influenced his contempt for what he perceived as the mass Secularisation and greed-inspired Americanization of Irish culture beginning in the 1960s. His views on this era are best expressed in his poems &quot;Éire ina bhfuil romhainn&quot; (&quot;Ireland in the Times Ahead&quot;) and &quot;Mar chaitheamar an choinneal&quot; (&quot;As We Spent the Candle&quot;).

As he grew older, Ó Direáin increasingly mixed his literary and formalist idiom, the heart of which still remained, &quot;the spoken language of the Gaeltacht&quot;, with much older influences, such as traditional bardic poetry in Classical Gaelic by Pádraigín Haicéad and Dáibhí Ó Bruadair, the 17th-century Protestant translation of the Christian Bible by Bishop William Bedell, as well as Patrick Dinneen&#x27;s 1904 and 1927 dictionaries. Another influence upon Ó Direáin as he aged was the Postmodern literature and Irish language poetry composed by Casla, Connemara native and Tallaght schoolteacher Caitlín Maude.

Furthermore, during the early 1980s, Ó Direáin chose to take the risks of crossing what was still a &quot;hard border&quot; and the danger of falling victim to the ongoing paramilitary violence by Ulster Loyalists during The Troubles. Ó Direáin travelled to Northern Ireland and gave a poetry reading at the Cumann Chluain Ard, an urban language revival club in the Ulster Irish-speaking Gaeltacht Quarter of West Belfast.

In a November 1984 lecture in Ó Direáin&#x27;s presence, Desmond Egan commented, &quot;I have long considered him not only the finest Irish poet, writing in Irish, of our times; but more: that very embodiment of that Irish civilisation and ethos, that precious &quot;cultura&quot; which has now become a threatened species, the survival of which is by no means assured. Ó Direáin could - and with more justification than the Englishman - adopt Lytton Strachey&#x27;s claim during The Great War to be, &#x27;the civilisation for which you are fighting.&#x27;&quot;

==Personal life==
According to his English translator Frank Sewell, &quot;It is evident from the poems that an early love affair and broken relationship haunts many of Ó Direáin&#x27;s poems, even if he remains circumspect about the identity of the particular Aran-island Beatrice dei Bardi or Maude Gonne who set him off on the well-worn poets&#x27; path of longing for an absent Muse.&quot;

Máirtín Ó Direáin married Áine Colivet, a Dublin native of French descent, in 1945. They had one child, a daughter named Niamh Ní Dhireáin, in 1947. Ó Direáin&#x27;s wife died in 1976.

==Death==
His literary awards include the An Chomhairle Ealaíon/The Arts Council Awards (1964 and 1971); the Butler Prize, with Eoghan Ó Tuairisc (1967); the Ossian-Preis für Dichtung from the Freiherr vom Stein Foundation in Hamburg, West Germany (1977). He was also a member of Aosdána.

Máirtín Ó Direáin died in Dublin on 19 March 1988.

The texts of a series of lectures that Máirtín Ó Direáin had delivered on his own work in University College Dublin in 1969, were later edited by Eoghan Ó hAnluain and published posthumously in 2002 as &quot;Ón ulán ramhar siar&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Carraig agus cathair: Ó Direáin&quot; is a recent (2002) biography. Its title (&#x27;The Rock and the City&#x27;) refers to Ó Direáin&#x27;s journey from his native rocky island to Dublin, where he lived most of his life.

An Charraig Stoite (The Uprooted Rock) is a 2003 award-nominated TG4/Bord Scannán na hÉireann funded documentary on Máirtín Ó Direáin which was written by Alan Titley and produced and directed by Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín.

On 27 May 2010, An Post (the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Post Office) issued a single stamp to commemorate the birth centenary of Máirtín Ó Direáin featuring a portrait of the poet.

In 2018, the University of Galway, celebrated the 30th anniversary of Ó Direáin&#x27;s passing by making him one of the main themes of their annual celebration of Seachtain na Gaeilge. The title of the event and exhibit, which drew on university, State, and private archives, was &quot;&quot;Máirtín Ó Direáin – Fathach File&quot; / Reluctant Modernist&quot;. Ó Direáin&#x27;s daughter Niamh (née Ní Dhireáin) Sheridan, spoke at the event and was joined by her daughter and her grandson.

=== Legacy in Irish traditional music===
Six of Ó Direáin&#x27;s poems have been put to music by Irish traditional musician Colm Ó Snodaigh of the music group Kíla: &quot;Faoiseamh a Gheobhadsa&quot;, &quot;Maith Dhom&quot;, &quot;Bua na Mara&quot;, &quot;Dínit an Bhróin&quot;, &quot;An tEarrach Thiar&quot; and &quot;Bí i do Chrann&quot;. The first three were recorded on &quot;Handel&#x27;s Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Luna Park&quot; (two Kíla albums) and &quot;Giving&quot; - Colm Ó Snodaigh&#x27;s 2007 solo album.

Another more recent musical setting of &quot;Faoiseamh a Gheobhadsa&quot; was composed by Zoë Conway and her husband John McIntyre, who first recorded their arrangement as part of the album &quot;Allt&quot;, which is a collaboration with Scottish traditional musician Julie Fowlis and her husband Éamonn Doorley. A native speaker of the North Uist dialect of Scottish Gaelic, Julie Fowlis has performed the song alongside them, alternating verses in Scottish Gaelic with Zoë Conway singing the original Connacht Irish. Conway and McIntyre&#x27;s musical setting of Ó Direáin&#x27;s poem remains a very popular one, and they often perform it together on the concert stage.

==In translation==
* In 2020, a collection of Ó Direáin&#x27;s poems in Connaught Irish, along with translations into English by Frank Sewell, were published by Wake Forest University Press.
* In 2021, Wisconsin-based poet Margaret Noodin was inspired, after hearing Zoë Conway and John McIntyre&#x27;s musical setting, to translate Máirtín Ó Direáin&#x27;s poem &quot;Faoiseamh a Gheobhadsa&quot; from Connaught Irish into the Ojibwe language. In an essay about her translation, Noodin drew parallels between the ongoing language revival efforts by both the Irish people and the Ojibwe people, which are both, she explained, an effort to reverse the damage done by colonialism, linguistic imperialism, and the coercive Anglicisation of the educational system.

<text>State insects are designated by 48 individual states of the fifty United States. Some states have more than one designated insect, or have multiple categories (e.g., state insect and state butterfly, etc.). Iowa and Michigan are the two states without a designated state insect.

More than half of the insects chosen are not native to North America, because of the inclusion of two European species (European honey bee and European mantis), the former having been chosen by numerous states.

<doc id="1109898" wikidata="Q5608435" url="?curid=1109898" title="Greyhound adoption">
<text>Greyhound adoption or Greyhound rescue programs focus on finding homes for greyhounds who are no longer needed for racing. Greyhounds have had a reputation for being gentle, people-centered dogs, and &quot;par-excellence for persons wishing for a companion for themselves or their children&quot;.

As of 2024, most greyhound adoption programs are based in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as each of those countries still has relatively large greyhound racing industries. 

== History ==
Early adoptions became in the United Kingdom as early as 1956.

In the United States, greyhound adoption did not begin on a wide scale until 1981, when Seabrook Greyhound Park in New Hampshire distributed a newspaper to track patrons promoting greyhounds as pets. 

Greyhound Pets of America (GPA) was established in 1987 for the purpose of finding homes for ex-racing greyhounds and educating the public on the suitability and availability of Greyhounds as pets, and is the largest non-profit greyhound adoption group. GPA has adopted out over 80,000 Greyhounds.

One of the last major greyhound adoption agencies in the United States closed permanently in 2022, given that there are now only two greyhound tracks left in the United States, both in West Virginia. Additional groups in the US that facilitate greyhound adoptions now exclusively get their dogs from Ireland or Australia.

<doc id="1109899" wikidata="Q605960" url="?curid=1109899" title="Socialist Forces Front">
<text>The Socialist Forces Front (; ) is a social democratic and secularist political party, mainly supported by Berbers in Algeria. The FFS is a member of the Socialist International and the Progressive Alliance. It led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Algerian government from 1963 to 1964.

==History and profile==
===Establishment and rebellion (1963)===

The party was formed by Hocine Aït Ahmed on 29 September 1963 in the city of Tizi Ouzou to oppose Ben Bella&#x27;s government. Following the party&#x27;s creation, Aït Ahmed began an armed rebellion and captured a number of towns in Kabylia. The Ben Bella government, aided by the National Liberation Army, swiftly took control of the dissident towns during a mostly bloodless confrontation. The FFS rebels were not supported by the people and were pushed into the mountains by the government&#x27;s army. Preferring to avoid direct conflict, the FFS and its soldiers retracted into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla tactics. The rebellion was defeated in 1964 and Hocine Aït Ahmed was arrested and sentenced to death.

The 1963 conflict resulted in 10 months of armed confrontation in the region, leaving more than four hundred dead, and most of the FLN leaders from Kabylia and the eastern provinces either executed or forced into exile. Hocine Aït Ahmed escaped prison in 1966 and fled to Switzerland.

===Party legalization (1990)===
The party was legalised in 1990. It however boycotted the 2002 and 2007 legislative elections and the 2009 presidential election &quot;calling it systematic electoral fraud in favour of the ruling parties&quot;.

=== 2012 legislative election ===

Though former Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali urged a boycott on the grounds that the election would be &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot;, the party decided to participate in the 2012 legislative election. Apart from international monitors being invited to observe the process, Algerian Workers&#x27; Party leader Louisa Hanoune, a quite successful candidate to the 2009 presidential elections, had announced to work towards an alliance of the two parties.

Hocine Aït Ahmed wrote to the Council of the Nation saying that &quot;participation in these elections is a tactical necessity for the FFS, which falls in line with (its) construction strategy of peaceful democratic alternative to this despotic regime, corrupt and destructive. [The purpose of the party] does not lie in a quota of seats to reach [but] in mobilising political[ly] and peaceful[ly] in our party and our people.&quot; With an electoral result of mere 2.47%, the party reached 27 seats making it the second-largest opposition power after the Islamist Green Algeria Alliance.

<text>Saint Nino (sometimes St. Nune or St. Ninny; ; ; ; c. 296 – c. 338 or 340) was a woman who preached Christianity in the territory of the Kingdom of Iberia, in what is modern-day Georgia. Her preaching resulted in the Christianization of Iberia.

According to most traditional accounts, she belonged to a Greek-speaking Roman family from Kolastra, Cappadocia, was a relative of Saint George, and came to Iberia from Constantinople. Other sources claim she was from Rome, Jerusalem or Gaul (modern France). 

At the age of 14, she was a lady in waiting to a woman whom King Diocletian wanted to marry, though the woman was a Christian, and didn&#x27;t want to. St. Nino, the woman, and the rest of her ladies in waiting fled, and all were slaughtered but Nino, who hid in a rose bush. She had a vision of the Mother Of God, the Most Holy Virgin Theotokos, giving her a cross and telling her to go to Iberia to spread the gospel. When she awoke, there was a cross on her chest. She cut some of her hair to fasten the cross, and took it into villages in Iberia and converted the whole country.

According to legend, she performed miraculous healings and converted the Georgian queen, Nana, and eventually the pagan king Mirian III of Iberia, who, lost in darkness and blinded on a hunting trip, found his way only after he prayed to &quot;Nino&#x27;s God&quot;. Mirian declared Christianity as the official religion of his kingdom (c. 327) and Nino continued her missionary activities among Georgians until her death.

Her tomb is still shown at the Bodbe Monastery in Kakheti, eastern Georgia. St. Nino has become one of the most venerated saints of the Georgian Orthodox Church and her attribute, a grapevine cross, is a symbol of Georgian Christianity.

She was named Christina by Rufin and Theognasta by Byzantines.

==Early life==

Many sources agree that Nino was born in the small town of Colastri, in the Roman province of Cappadocia, although a smaller number of sources disagree with this. On her family and origin, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have different traditions.

According to the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, she was the only child of a famous family. Her father was Roman general Zabulon (Zebulun) and her mother Susanna (Sosana, Susan). On her father&#x27;s side, Nino was related to St. George, and on her mother&#x27;s, to the patriarch of Jerusalem, Houbnal I.

During her childhood, Nino was brought up by the nun Niofora-Sarah of Bethlehem. Nino&#x27;s uncle, who was the patriarch of Jerusalem, oversaw her traditional upbringing. Nino went to Rome with the help of her uncle where she decided to preach the Christian gospel in Iberia, known to her as the resting place of Christ&#x27;s tunic. According to the legend, Nino received a vision where the Virgin Mary gave her a grapevine cross and said:

:&quot;Go to Iberia and tell there the Good Tidings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and you will find favour before the Lord; and I will be for you a shield against all visible and invisible enemies. By the strength of this cross, you will erect in that land the saving banner of faith in My beloved Son and Lord.&quot;

She woke up from this vision with the cross in her hands, and she tied the cross together with her own hair. Shortly after, Saint Nino entered the Iberian Kingdom in Caucasus from the Kingdom of Armenia, where she escaped persecution at the hands of the Armenian King Tiridates III. She had belonged to a community of virgins numbering 35, along with martyr Hripsime, under the leadership of St. Gayane, who preached Christianity in the Armenian Kingdom. They were all, with the exception of Nino, tortured and beheaded by Tiridates. All 35 of the virgins were soon canonised by the Armenian Apostolic Church, including Nino (as St. Nune).

Contrasting with this, the Roman Catholic tradition, as narrated by Rufinus of Aquileia, says Nino was brought to Iberia not by her own will, but as a slave, and that her family tree is obscure.

==St Nino in Iberia==

Nino reached the borders of the ancient Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the south about 320. There she placed a Christian cross in the small town of Akhalkalaki and started preaching the Christian faith in Urbnisi, finally reaching Mtskheta (the capital of Iberia). The Iberian Kingdom had been influenced by the neighbouring Persian Empire which played an important role as the regional power in the Caucasus. The Iberian King Mirian III and his nation worshiped the syncretic gods Armazi and Zaden. Soon after the arrival of Nino in Mtskheta, Nana, the Queen of Iberia requested an audience with the Cappadocian.

Queen Nana, who suffered from a severe illness, had some knowledge of Christianity but had not yet converted to it. Nino, restoring the Queen&#x27;s health, won to herself disciples from the Queen&#x27;s attendants, including a Jewish priest and his daughter, Abiathar and Sidonia. Nana also officially converted to Christianity and was baptized by Nino herself. Mirian, aware of his wife&#x27;s religious conversion, was intolerant of her new faith, persecuting it and threatening to divorce his wife if she did not leave the faith. He secluded himself, however, from Nino and the growing Christian community in his kingdom. His isolation to Christianity did not last long because, according to the legend, while on a hunting trip, he was suddenly struck blind as total darkness emerged in the woods. In a desperate state, King Mirian uttered a prayer to the God of St Nino:

:If indeed that Christ whom the Captive had preached to his Wife was God, then let Him now deliver him from this darkness, that he too might forsake all other gods to worship Him.

As soon as he finished his prayer, light appeared and the king hastily returned to his palace in Mtskheta. As a result of this miracle, the King of Iberia renounced idolatry under the teaching of St Nino and was baptized as the first Christian King of Iberia. Soon, the whole of his household and the inhabitants of Mtskheta adopted Christianity. In 326 King Mirian made Christianity the state religion of his kingdom, making Iberia the second Christian state after Armenia.

After adopting Christianity, Mirian sent an ambassador to Byzantium, asking Emperor Constantine I to have a bishop and priests sent to Iberia. Constantine, having learned of Iberia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, granted Mirian the new church land in Jerusalem and sent a delegation of bishops to the court of the Georgian King. Roman historian Tyrannius Rufinus in &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; writes about Mirian&#x27;s request to Constantine:

:After the church had been built with due magnificence, the people were zealously yearning for God&#x27;s faith. So an embassy is sent on behalf of the entire nation to the Emperor Constantine, in accordance with the captive woman&#x27;s advice. The foregoing events are related to him, and a petition submitted, requesting that priests be sent to complete the work which God had begun. Sending them on their way amidst rejoicing and ceremony, the Emperor was far more glad at this news than if he had annexed to the Roman Empire peoples and realms unknown.

In 334, Mirian commissioned the building of the first Christian church in Iberia which was finally completed in 379 on the spot where now stands the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta.

Nino, having witnessed the conversion of Iberia to Christianity, withdrew to the mountain pass in Bodbe, Kakheti. St Nino died soon after; immediately after her death, King Mirian commenced with the building of monastery in Bodbe, where her tomb can still be seen in the churchyard.

The Georgian name Nino is &quot;Nune&quot; in Armenian. Her history as the only one of the 35 nuns of the company of the saints Gayane and Hripsime to escape the slaughter at the hands of the pagan Armenian King Tiradates III in 301 is recounted in the history of Movses Khorenatsi.

==Legacy==
The Phoka Convent of St. Nino was established in rural Georgia by Abbess Elizabeth and two novices. They originally lived in a nearby house owned by Georgian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Ilia II, then in 1992 moved to the site of an 11th-century church to restore it.

The Sacred Monastery of Saint Nina is the home of a monastic community of Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Christian nuns in the Patriarchate of Georgia&#x27;s North American Diocese. It is located in Union Bridge, Maryland, USA, and was established in September 2012.

&quot;Nino&quot; and its variants remain the most popular name for women and girls in the Republic of Georgia. There are currently 88,442 women over the age of 16 with that name residing in the country, according to the Georgian Ministry of Justice. It also continues to be a popular name for baby girls.

Her parents Zabulon and Susanna were canonised in 1997.

<text>Progressistas (; PP) is a centre-right to right-wing political party in Brazil. Founded in 1995 as the Brazilian Progressive Party, it emerged from parties that were successors to ARENA, the ruling party of the Brazilian military dictatorship. A pragmatist party, it supported the governments of presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Dilma Rousseff, Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro. Largely it was the party of the politics of Paulo Maluf, a former governor and mayor of São Paulo. Of all political parties, in corruption investigation Operation Car Wash, the Progressistas had the most convictions.

The party in recent years had fully embraced the right. In the 2018 Brazilian general election, the party supported the candidacy of Geraldo Alckmin. After the election, although they remained neutral in the second round, the party has almost fully supported the policies of Jair Bolsonaro, supporting his candidacy for president in 2022 and voting with him 93% of the time.

== History ==

Founded in 1995, as Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB), by the union of:
*the Reform Progressive Party, founded in 1993 by Democratic Social Party and Christian Democratic Party;
*the Progressive Party, founded in 1993 by the Social Labour Party and the Reform Labour Party.

The party entered in coalition with the Brazilian Social Democracy Party and the Liberal Front Party, supporting President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the 1998 Brazilian general election.

In the 2002 general election, the party informally supported the candidacy of Ciro Gomes in the first round and formally supported José Serra in the second round.

In 2003, the party re-changed its name to the Progressive Party. PP has also supported the Workers&#x27; Party-led government from 2003 to 2015.

At the parliamentary elections, held in October 2006, the party won 42 of the 513 seats in the chamber of deputies, and it has one of the 81 seats in the Senate. At the 2010 elections, PP won 41 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and made gains in the Senate for a total of five seats. It lost an extremely close gubernatorial runoff in Roraima to the PSDB, and won no state governorships.

In the 2010 elections, alliances between moderate and left-leaning parties took place in several places, such as in Bahia, where the PP was part of the PT candidate&#x27;s coalition, having even nominated its vice governor.  About this type of coalition, the former mayor of São Paulo and former PT member Luísa Erundina declared, still in May 2010, that &quot;It is sad, agonizing to see Maluf&#x27;s PP with PCdoB. It&#x27;s all the same&quot;.&quot;&quot; 

Its most well-known politicians are Paulo Maluf, mayor and governor of São Paulo for several terms, Esperidião Amin, former governor of Santa Catarina and senator, and Francisco Dornelles, former minister of Labour and senator for the state of Rio de Janeiro.

The party has from its very beginning shown a tendency for regional division, with the section from Rio Grande do Sul state often threatening with secession, in part due to what is viewed by them as condescendence of the party&#x27;s national direction towards members involved in corruption scandals, including Paulo Maluf (who has recently been discharged from his post as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of PP). The national orientation of the party has been one of close alliance with Lula&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party government (except on issues sensitive to the right wing core of PP, such as taxes), while the section of Rio Grande do Sul once more show a defiant stance in aligning itself more often with the opposition.

The Progressive Party supported the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, splitting its alliance with the Worker&#x27;s Party.

This party was most affected by the Petrobras corruption scandal, damaging its national popularity.

The party supported the candidacy of Geraldo Alckmin in 2018, but did not endorse a candidate in the second round.

After the election, the party joined a coalition with the Republicanos and the Liberal Party to support Jair Bolsonaro in government.

== Ideology ==

The party has traditionally been, like many right-wing parties in Brazil, one of pragmatism and moderation, largely allying with larger left-wing parties. The party&#x27;s main positions in Congress have been that of business interests supporting lower taxation, highlighing those proposals in accordance with other economic growth principles of the left. When allied with the governments of Lula and Dilma, the party supported the Bolsa Familia program in confluence with tax cuts for economic growth.

In more recent years, however, the party has become more stridently national conservative, representing the less religious and less populist conservatism that existed in Brazil before the election of Bolsonaro. The party supported greater economic nationalism than some of its coalition partners and is generally less in support of the military than the Liberal Party. However, in general, the party supports Bolsonarismo, and many of his cabinet members are members or have joined the party.

== Notable members ==
* Esperidião Amin, former mayor of Florianópolis, Senator, former Federal Deputy, and former Governor of Santa Catarina
* Roberto Campos, former Minister of Planning for the military dictatorship and Senator of Republic for Mato Grosso
* Severino Cavalcanti, former President of the Chamber of Deputies and deputy for Pernambuco
* Tereza Cristina, Senator of former Federal Deputy for Mato Grosso do Sul and former Minister of Agriculture
* Luis Carlos Heinze, Senator and former Federal Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul
* Paulo Maluf, former Federal Deputy, Governor, Mayor of São Paulo
* Ciro Nogueira, former Chief of Staff of the Presidency, Senator of Piauí, and National President of the Progressistas

<doc id="1109907" wikidata="Q3543420" url="?curid=1109907" title="Girl Got Game">
<text>Girl Got Game, originally published in Japan as Power!!, is a manga series written and illustrated by Shizuru Seino. Originally serialized in &quot;Bessatsu Friend&quot; from 1999 until 2002, the individual chapters have been collected and published in ten &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha. The series focuses on Kyo Aizawa, a girl forced by her father to live as a boy so she can be on her new school&#x27;s boys&#x27; top-ranked basketball team. It is licensed for an English language release in North America by Tokyopop, which completed releasing the series in August 2005.

==Characters==
* – a high school girl who wants a cute boyfriend and to wear the lovely Seisyu High School girl&#x27;s uniform. Unfortunately, ever since her father tore his Achilles tendon, he hoped and planned for her to fulfill his dream of being a basketball star. Grudgingly, she attends Seisyu as a boy and proves to be an invaluable member of the boys&#x27; basketball team though she is also the shortest member. She is very popular with the girls at Seisyu, who think she&#x27;s a boy. Despite her desire to be feminine, Kyo has a very masculine way of interacting with people. Whether this is her nature or the effect of sharing a dormitory with boys is unclear.
* – one of the best players in the boys&#x27; basketball team, and one of the most popular guys at Seisyu. He and Kyo are roommates and the two initially get off to a bad start, but gradually learn to get along relatively well and he eventually develops a crush on her. Chiharu is the first of Kyo&#x27;s friends to learn that she is a girl and immediately begins to help her cover up her secret, despite not understanding why. Despite his popularity with girls, Chiharu is more interested in basketball than girls, a practice that lost him his first girlfriend. He is very irritable and seems always annoyed at something, which partially due to his loving Kyo and being unwilling to admit it. Despite that he has a good heart underneath. Kyo is very good at &quot;pushing his buttons&quot;.
* – a fellow member of the basketball team and Kyo&#x27;s faithful companion. Hamaya is mostly after girls and is the least popular player in the team. Though hopeless with most girls, he eventually gets a girlfriend, Emiri Kozono, until she moves to Germany. He is the biggest comic relief and is prone to inexplicably losing all of his clothes (including his underwear). He is extremely perverted and keeps a large stash of pornographic videos and magazines. As a member of the basketball team, Hamaya is frequently Kyo&#x27;s &quot;stepladder&quot; for her slam dunks.
* – the captain of Seisyu&#x27;s boys&#x27; basketball team. He has a room to himself (which he frequently shares with Chiharu when he and Kyo argue) and is very popular. Imai is a very good friend of Chiharu&#x27;s and a friendly upbeat person, willing to help his friends should they call upon him. In volume 9, he and the rest of the boys&#x27; basketball team (except Chiharu and Kensuke, who were keeping this secret) discover that Kyo is a girl. When Kyo challenges the basketball team to get her position back, Imai is the only one who is able to stop her, giving merit to his position as the basketball team captain.
* – Kyo&#x27;s longtime friend who enrolled in Seisyu in order to play basketball with Kyo and became the captain of the girls&#x27; basketball team. Tsuyaka is prone to a frightening attitude and does not look like a teenage student, standing around six feet tall. She is very determined, very ruthless, and can be somewhat selfish and insensitive to others. For part of the series, Hamaya expresses a profound interest in her. She exposes Kyo&#x27;s secret to Chiharu after losing a game to him in hopes of forcing Kyo to join the girls&#x27; team. Tsuyaka is persistent and insistent that Kyo openly becomes a girl again so that she may play on Seisyu&#x27;s girls&#x27; basketball team, and will not hesitate to use underhanded means if necessary.
* – a high-ranking basketball player and a genius due to his photographic memory, Kensuke lives a hard life despite being bright and an excellent basketball player. He does not live in the dormitory with the other students. He has a crush on Kyo, and because of this, he re-joins the boys&#x27; basketball team just to be with her. He suspects Kyo is a girl when he first meets her and she later confirms it. Kensuke displays extreme emotional distress and even goes as far as to attempt suicide by burning down a building with Kyo and himself trapped inside. However, Chiharu saves them both and Kensuke is gradually able to accept Kyo&#x27;s friendship and finds various ways to try to bring her together with Chiharu.
* – the boys&#x27; team manager and has a major crush on Kyo; she thinks Kyo is actually a boy, even when Kyo comes to school dressed as a girl, probably due to denial. Not surprisingly, her crush is unrequited, and Akari eventually stops trying to get close to Kyo when she mistakenly believes that Kyo (as a boy) is attracted to boys. She is very energetic and aggressive (to the point where she is credited with being Kyo&#x27;s first kiss), and proficient with many forms of weaponry, which she can suddenly pull from thin-air.
* – Kyo&#x27;s father, a talented basketball player until his Achilles&#x27; tendon tore. With his dreams of joining the NBA shot down, he passed down his love of the game to Kyo, who enjoyed playing basketball because it meant spending time with her dad. He dreams for Kyo to play in the NBA (NBA or WNBA, unknown) - and ultimately made the decision to enroll her in Seisyu as a boy.
* – the dorm manager of the boys&#x27; dormitory at Seisyu High. She was previously a basketball player capable enough to keep up with most boys, but an injury ended her aspirations, much like Kyo&#x27;s father. Notably, she does not appear beyond the first volume, which is something characters poke fun at during the series.
* – the coach of the boys&#x27; basketball team, who is as moody and irritable as the teenagers he works with.

<doc id="1109918" wikidata="Q156565" url="?curid=1109918" title="Belz">
<text>Belz (, ; ; ) is a small city in Lviv Oblast, western Ukraine, located near the border with Poland between the Solokiya River (a tributary of the Bug River) and the Richytsia stream. Belz hosts the administration of Belz urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is approximately 

== Origin of name ==
There are a few theories as to the origin of the name:
* Celtic – &quot;belz&quot; (water) or &quot;pelz&quot; (stream),
* German – &quot;&quot; (fur, furry)
* Old Slavic and the Boyko language – «белз» or «бевз» (muddy place),
* Old East Slavic – «бълизь» (white place, a glade in the midst of dark woods).

The name occurs only in two other places, the first being a Celtic area in antiquity, and the second one being derived from its Romanian name:
* &quot;Belz&quot; (department Morbihan), Brittany, France
* &quot;Bălți&quot; (/&quot;Beljcy&quot;, also known in Yiddish as &quot;Beltz&quot;), Moldova (Bessarabia)

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Belz is situated in a fertile plain which tribes of Indo-European origin settled in ancient times: Celtic Lugii, next (2nd-5th century) Germanic Goths, slavized Sarmatians (White Croats), and at last Slavic Dulebes (later Buzhans), who eventually become part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; in 907, when Dulebs took part in Oleg&#x27;s military campaign against Czargrad (Constantinople). Mainly рolish historiography located here also Lendians tribe whо also paid tribute to Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The town has existed at least since the 10th century as one of the Cherven Cities which were under Polish rule in the 970s. In 981 Belz was incorporated into Kievan Rus&#x27;. In 1170, the town became the seat of a duchy. In 1234 it was incorporated into the Duchy of Galicia–Volhynia, which would control Belz until 1340 when it came under Lithuanian rule.

Belz was under Polish rule from 1366 to 1772, first as a fief, and since 1462 as the capital of a voivodeship. On October 5, 1377, the town was granted rights under the Magdeburg law by Władysław Opolczyk, the governor of Red Ruthenia. A charter dated November 10, 1509 once again granted Belz privileges under the Magdeburg rights.

In 1772, Belz was incorporated into the Habsburg Empire (later Austrian Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire) where it was a part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Belz received a railway connection in 1884 with the opening of the railway line Jarosław–Kowel.

=== Modern history ===
With the collapse of Austria-Hungary following World War I in November 1918, Belz was included in the Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. It came under Polish control in 1919 during the Polish-Ukrainian War. In April 1920, the Second Polish Republic, represented by Józef Piłsudski, and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, represented by Symon Petlura signed the Treaty of Warsaw, in which they agreed that the Polish-Ukrainian border in Western Ukraine would follow the Zbruch River. This left Belz, along with the rest of Eastern Galicia in the Polish Republic.

From 1919 to 1939 Belz was annexed to the Lviv Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic.

From 1939 to 1944 Belz was occupied by Germany as a part of the General Government. Belz is situated on left, north waterside of the Solokiya river (affluent of the Bug river), which was the German-Soviet border in 1939–1941. During the war, the delegation of the Hrubeshiv Ukrainian Relief Committee operated in the city.

After the war Belz reverted to Poland (where it was again within the Lublin Voivodeship) until 1951 when, after a border readjustment, it passed to the Soviet Union (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). (See: 1951 Polish–Soviet territorial exchange) Since 1991 it has been part of independent Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Belz belonged to Sokal Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Sokal Raion was merged into Chervonohrad Raion (modern Sheptytskyi Raion).

== Jewish history ==

The Ashkenazi Jewish community in Belz was established circa 14th century. In 1665, the Jews in Belz received equal rights and duties. The town became home to a Hasidic dynasty in the early 19th century.

The Rabbi of Belz, Shalom Rokeach (1779–1855), also known as the &quot;Sar Shalom&quot;, joined the Hasidic movement by studying with the Maggid of Lutzk, and established the community and become the first &quot;Belzer Rebbe&quot;, thereby establishing the Belz Hasidic dynasty.
When Rebbe Shalom died in 1855, his youngest son, Rebbe Yehoshua Rokeach (1855–1894), became the next Rebbe. 
Belzer Hasidism grew in size during the tenure of Rebbe Yehoshua&#x27;s son and successor, Rebbe Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer Rebbe)(1894–1926). Rebbe Yissachar Dov&#x27;s son and successor, Rebbe Aharon Rokeach (1880 to 1957), escaped from Nazi-occupied Europe to Israel in 1944, re-establishing the Hasidut first in Tel Aviv and then in Jerusalem. For recent history see .
At the beginning of World War I, Belz had 6100 inhabitants, including 3600 Jews, 1600 Ukrainians, and 900 Poles. During the German and Soviet invasion of Poland (September 1939), most of the Jews of Belz fled to the Soviet Union in Autumn 1939 (the German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation). However, by May 1942, there were over 1,540 local Jewish residents and refugees in Belz. On June 2, 1942, 1,000 Jews were deported to Hrubieszów and from there to Sobibor extermination camp. Another 504 were brought to Hrubieszów in September of that year, after they were no longer needed to work on the farms in the area.

== Cultural trivia ==
The Yiddish song &quot;“Beltz, Mayn Shtetele”&quot; is a moving evocation of a happy childhood spent in a shtetl. Originally this song was composed for a town which bears a similar-sounding name in Yiddish (&quot;belts&quot;), called Bălți in Moldovan/Romanian, and is located in Bessarabia (presently the Moldova Republic). Later interpretations may have had &quot;Belz&quot; in mind, though. The song has special significance in Holocaust history, as a 16-year-old playing the song was overheard by an SS guard at Auschwitz extermination camp, who then forced the child to play it repeatedly to ease the moods of Jews being herded into the gas chambers.

Belz is also a very important place for Ukrainian Catholics and Polish Catholics as a place where the Black Madonna of Częstochowa (this icon was believed to have been painted by St. Luke the Evangelist) had resided for several centuries until 1382, when Władysław Opolczyk, duke of Opole, took the icon home to his principality after ending his service as the Royal emissary for Halychyna for Louis I of Hungary.

<text>The Iowa Events Center is a public events complex located in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, United States.

==History==

The Iowa Events Center consists of the existing Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center, the existing Polk County Convention Complex, the new Hy-Vee Hall, and the new Wells Fargo Arena. The new buildings were designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport Venue Event), who were also the architects of the renovated Principal Park in Des Moines, the United Center in Chicago, and many other arenas and stadiums in the United States. The project cost $217 million, making this the largest public project in Iowa history. Funding for the project came from Polk County and its cities, private donations, and the Vision Iowa Fund that Gov. Tom Vilsack signed into law in 2000. Gambling profits from the Prairie Meadows casino in nearby Altoona are expected to pay off the debt.

Construction began in early 2002 after Polk County reached a project-labor agreement with local labor unions that guaranteed favorable wages and working conditions in exchange for no work stoppages. Polk County was soon sued by right to work supporters who claimed that the use of a project-labor agreement on a public project violated Iowa&#x27;s right to work laws. The lawsuit halted construction for several months, but on November 14, 2002, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in Polk County&#x27;s favor.

On April 22, 2004, Polk County agreed to transfer management of the Iowa Events Center to Global Spectrum, a Comcast subsidiary, of Philadelphia. Global Spectrum soon announced that the new Iowa Stars hockey team would be the center&#x27;s primary tenant. In September 2004, Global Spectrum announced that ticket purchases will be done through Patron Solutions, another Comcast subsidiary, instead of Ticketmaster.

==Venues==
===Current===
====Wells Fargo Arena====
Named for title sponsor Wells Fargo Financial Services, Wells Fargo Arena has been the Des Moines area&#x27;s primary venue for sporting events and concerts since it opened on July 12, 2005. The state high school wrestling and basketball tournaments have been held there since 2006. In fall 2007, it became home to the Iowa Energy (later named Iowa Wolves) of the NBA D-League/G League. The following spring, the reactivated Iowa Barnstormers arena football began playing at the Wells Fargo Arena. Wells Fargo Arena seats 15,181 for hockey games, 16,110 for basketball games, and as many as 16,980 for concerts.

====EMC Expo Center====
EMC Expo Center (formerly named Hy-Vee Hall, which the Hy-Vee supermarket chain (based in West Des Moines) owned the naming rights to), is the Iowa Events Center&#x27;s new exhibition hall. It features 100,000 square feet (9,000 m2) of space for trade shows, conventions, and other major events. It also features eight meeting rooms with a total of 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2) of meeting space. The south end of Hy-Vee Hall houses the Iowa Hall of Pride, which honors the achievements of Iowa high school athletes and performers.

Although it was still incomplete, Hy-Vee Hall hosted its first event, the Autumn Festival, from October 21 through October 23, 2004. It was formally dedicated on December 15, 2004, while the Iowa Hall of Pride opened to the public on February 23, 2005.

====Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center====
Originally an arena known as Veterans Memorial Auditorium that served as home to Drake University basketball and Iowa Barnstormers arena football, Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center was renovated and reopened as a convention hall in January 2012.

===Former===
====Polk County Convention Complex====

Nicknamed &quot;The Plex&quot; the Polk County Convention Complex opened in 1985. It features of exhibition space on two levels and 27 meeting rooms. Polk County originally planned to close the Convention Complex when Hy-Vee Hall opened, but they decided to transfer management of the building to Global Spectrum in August 2004. While the Convention Complex is located south of the other buildings, Global Spectrum marketed it as part of the Iowa Events Center. The facility has since been converted into a YMCA.

<text>Colin Steele McRae, (5 August 1968 – 15 September 2007), was a British rally driver from Scotland. He was the 1991 and 1992 British Rally Champion, and in 1995 became the first Scottish driver to win the World Rally Championship Drivers&#x27; title.

At 27, McRae was the youngest-ever World Champion, a record that stood until 2022. McRae&#x27;s performances with the Subaru World Rally Team enabled the team to win the World Rally Championship Manufacturers&#x27; title three times in succession in 1995, 1996 and 1997. After four years with the Ford Motor Co. team, where McRae won nine events, he moved to Citroën World Rally Team in 2003 where, despite not winning an event, he helped them win their first manufacturers&#x27; title. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to motorsport in 1996. With 25 victories in the WRC, McRae held the record for the most wins in the series at the time of his retirement from full-time rallying in 2003.

In 2007, McRae was killed when the helicopter he was piloting crashed near his home. His son and two family friends were also killed.

==Personal life==
McRae was born in Lanark, Scotland, to Jimmy and Margaret McRae. Jimmy McRae was the five-time winner of the British Rally Championship. McRae was the eldest of three brothers; his middle brother, Alister McRae, is also a rally car driver. McRae&#x27;s maternal uncle Hugh &quot;Shug&quot; Steele was also a former rally driver. He attended Robert Owen Primary School and Lanark Grammar School and studied for a year at Coatbridge College. He worked at Archie&#x27;s Autos then at his father&#x27;s plumbing and heating business as a technician.

McRae was married to Alison (née Hamilton), whom he met aged 19 when she acted as his co-driver, and had two children, Hollie and Johnny. McRae moved to the principality of Monaco in 1995, partly through his friendship with David Coulthard. However, as his young family grew up, he spent more time back at his home in Lanarkshire. The couple bought the 17th-century Jerviswood House. McRae&#x27;s nephew, Max McRae, is also a motorsport racer.

In 1996, McRae was appointed a Member of the British Empire for services to motorsports in the Birthday Honours list.

==Career==

===Early career===
McRae began his competitive career in motorsport riding trial bikes at an early age, despite being more interested in four-wheeled machines rather than two-wheel bikes. He became the Scottish schoolboy motocross champion at the age of thirteen. At the age of sixteen, through the Coltness Car Club, McRae found autotesting, obtained a Mini Cooper and started competing. A year later, he began to negotiate with another club member to use a borrowed Hillman Avenger GT for the Kames Stages, a single-venue stage rally not far from McRae&#x27;s home. McRae finished the event thirteenth; first in his class although he had run most of the event in a higher position.

In 1986, driving a Talbot Sunbeam, McRae entered the Scottish Rally Championship with Ian Grindrod, his father&#x27;s co-driver, as his co-driver, and soon made a name for himself with his speed and exciting style of driving. His driving style drew many comparisons to Finnish ex-World Rally Champion Ari Vatanen, whom McRae had always idolised.

His first WRC event was the 1987 Swedish Rally in a Vauxhall Nova where he finished 36th overall, and again two years later, driving the Sierra and finishing 15th overall. In 1988 he took the Scottish Rally Championship series crown in his Vauxhall Nova. His next car was a Ford Sierra XR 4x4. In 1989, he finished fifth overall at Rally New Zealand in a rear-wheel-drive Sierra Cosworth. In 1990 McRae achieved sixth place in that year&#x27;s RAC Rally, despite several accidents. In 1991, McRae turned professional as he was signed by Prodrive boss David Richards to his Subaru team in the British Rally Championship for an annual wage of approximately £10,000. McRae was British Rally Champion in both 1991 and 1992, soon graduating to the Subaru factory team at World Rally Championship level. In 1992, McRae made his debut in the British Touring Car Championship, with a one-off appearance for the Prodrive-run BMW factory team at the Knockhill round, where he collided with Matt Neal. Race officials found McRae to have caused an avoidable collision and subsequently disqualified him.

===World Rally Championship===

====1993–1998: Subaru====
On his promotion for 1993, McRae initially drove the Prodrive-built Group A Subaru Legacy alongside Finns Ari Vatanen, Hannu Mikkola and Markku Alén. McRae then won his first WRC rally in the car at that year&#x27;s Rally New Zealand. It was also the first rally win for the newly formed Subaru World Rally Team, shortly before the Legacy was due to be pensioned off in favour of the new Subaru Impreza 555. Such were the rising fortunes of his young Subaru factory team as they competed against the frontrunning Toyota-powered Team TTE, who were excluded from the championship after the 1995 Rally Catalunya due to the use of an illegal air restrictor. It took only until 1995 for McRae to win the driver&#x27;s title, which he secured with a victory in a straight contest with his double champion teammate, Carlos Sainz, on the season-ending Rally of Great Britain. Although still a winner with the outfit in individual rallies in succeeding years, including, increasingly, more specialised events such as the Acropolis Rally, Safari Rally and the Tour de Corse, McRae could not better second place in the standings in either 1996 or 1997, on both occasions behind Finland and Mitsubishi Ralliart&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen. He helped Subaru complete their run of three consecutive manufacturers&#x27; titles during this time. In what would turn out to be his final season with the team, in 1998 he won three more rallies and placed third in the standings, as well as winning the Race of Champions in Gran Canaria, the Canary Islands.

====1999–2002: Ford====
After several years of varying success, McRae switched to the M-Sport-run Ford factory team for 1999, driving the new Ford Focus rally car. The deal saw McRae earning six million pounds over two years, which at the time made him the highest-earning rally driver in history. He immediately had two consecutive wins at the Safari Rally and Rally Portugal. The new car had many shunts and reliability issues for much of the rest of that season, however, which resulted in only sixth place in the championship standings overall. Moreover, a rare personal pointless run had begun for McRae that year which only stopped with a podium on the following February&#x27;s Swedish Rally. McRae went on to be victorious on the asphalt turns of Catalunya and the gravel of Greece, and post 4th in the 2000 overall standings. Midway through the 2000 season, the lacking reliability of the Focus led to McRae threatening to leave the team if the problems continued. The upturn towards the end of the season resulted in him deciding to renew his contract with Ford for a further two years.

McRae&#x27;s intermittent success with Ford continued into 2001, where after failing to score in any of the first four rounds, including having momentarily led defending winner Tommi Mäkinen on the stages of the season-opening Monte Carlo Rally before being forced into retirement, he then went on to score three consecutive victories in Argentina, Cyprus and Greece to tie with Mäkinen at the top of the points table. However, having again led the championship outright entering the final round in Great Britain, McRae once more missed out on a possible second title, crashing out and finishing second in the driver&#x27;s championship, two points behind Subaru&#x27;s Richard Burns.

With victory in the Safari Rally in 2002, McRae made the record books as the driver with most event wins in the World Rally Championship. His record was broken by Carlos Sainz. McRae&#x27;s contract with Ford came to an end following the 2002 season, and after reportedly asking for wages of five million pounds a year, Ford decided against renewing the contract, reluctant to commit such a high amount of their budget to a driver&#x27;s salary. The two parties split into amicable terms, with Ford&#x27;s European director of motorsport Martin Whitaker stating &quot;On behalf of all of us at Ford Motor Company I would like to publicly thank Colin and Nicky for their efforts during the past four years with the Ford team. I wish them both well in the future.&quot; McRae said of his time with Ford &quot;It&#x27;s been a very successful four years, we&#x27;ve achieved a lot of very good results and I&#x27;m quite happy that myself and Ford have had a very successful partnership.&quot;

====2003: Citroën====
For 2003, McRae signed for Citroën, a team of winning pedigree due to its successes of the previous year with young Frenchman Sébastien Loeb but otherwise undertaking its first complete campaign at World Rally Championship level. McRae&#x27;s second-place finish on his début in Monte Carlo alongside Loeb and Carlos Sainz whom, aboard the Xsara WRC, helped complete a 1–2–3 finish, the finest result he would achieve for the team, as he ended the season in seventh in the drivers&#x27; championship, with no victories. Rule changes are brought in for the 2004 season changing the previous practice of having three nominated points-scorers within a team to two. With Loeb partway through a multiple-year contract, this meant the Citroën factory team, under Guy Fréquelin&#x27;s leadership, was forced to choose between dropping McRae or Sainz. With Sainz being the more successful of the two during the 2003 season, McRae had to look elsewhere for 2004. David Richards, McRae&#x27;s former boss at Subaru, who had by now taken over WRC&#x27;s commercial rights holders ISC and worried that the loss of a character like McRae would damage his ability to market the sport, set about trying to help McRae find a drive for 2004. McRae was unable to find a team, and for the first time in over ten years he would not be competing in the World Rally Championship.

===Later career===

McRae also competed in racing series other than the World Rally Championship. In September 2002 he took part in an ASCAR Racing Series event at the Rockingham Motor Speedway, Northamptonshire, finishing in sixth place.

McRae rejoined Prodrive for the 2004 24 Hours of Le Mans where he took third place in the GTS class, and ninth position overall in a Ferrari 550-GTS Maranello partnering Darren Turner and Rickard Rydell. Le Mans winner Allan McNish commented that &quot;Colin has adapted far better than people expected&quot; to endurance sportscar racing.
McRae made his debut on the Dakar Rally with Nissan in January 2004, and scored two stage wins. He returned to the Dakar in 2005 and was fastest on two of the first three stages in Morocco, before crashing out of the rally towards the end of stage six.

In 2004 and 2005, McRae represented Great Britain in the Race of Champions Nations Cup alongside Formula One driver and fellow Scot, David Coulthard. For the 2006 event England and Scotland entered separate teams with McRae and Coulthard re-uniting to represent Scotland.

In 2005, McRae competed in the Baja 500 Portalegre, winning the competition.

McRae then returned to the series for one-off drives for Škoda on the 2005 Rally GB and Rally Australia, respectively finishing seventh and retiring due to a clutch problem on the final leg of the rally, the latter ending prospects of Škoda&#x27;s best finish.

On 5 August 2006, McRae competed for Subaru in the first live televised American rally in Los Angeles as part of the X-Games. McRae rolled the car on the penultimate corner after landing awkwardly from a jump, which damaged the front bumper and left front tyre. Despite this, McRae kept the car running and continued on to the finish, his time only 0.13 seconds slower than eventual winner Travis Pastrana. He was unexpectedly entered for his final rally by semi-works Kronos Citroën at Rally Turkey in September, where he replaced Sébastien Loeb while the Frenchman recovered from an injury he sustained in a cycling accident immediately prior to the event. A final-stage alternator problem led to him retiring from seventh place. He was subsequently dropped by Citroën for the upcoming Rally Australia and replaced by Xavier Pons.
In August 2007, McRae said he was still hoping to find a seat for the 2008 WRC season, but said that &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t happen next year, then I won&#x27;t (return) because you can only be out of something at that level for so long.&quot; In 2007, talking to Autosport podcast, David Richards confirmed that he and McRae had talked about McRae&#x27;s comeback to Subaru for season 2008. Robert Reid was contacted by McRae to be his co-driver and the pair were due to test together, but McRae was killed before the test could take place.

==Death==
McRae died on 15 September 2007 whilst piloting his private helicopter, a Eurocopter AS350B2 Squirrel, which crashed north of Lanark, Scotland, close to the McRae family home. He was not licensed to fly the aircraft. McRae&#x27;s five-year-old son Johnny, and two family friends, Graeme Duncan and Johnny&#x27;s six-year-old friend Ben Porcelli, also died in the crash. McRae did not have permission to take Porcelli on the helicopter. McRae&#x27;s previously active website, &quot;ColinMcRae.com&quot;, was later replaced with a memorial screen stating a few details about the crash, and then with a short statement released on behalf of McRae&#x27;s father, Jimmy, and later a book of condolences.

===Funeral and celebration services===

The funeral for Colin and Johnny took place on 26 September at Daldowie Crematorium near Glasgow, conducted by the Rev Tom Houston, who had married the McRaes, and the Rev Steven Reid, chaplain at Johnny&#x27;s school. An address was given by Robbie Head, a former rally driver and commentator who was a close friend of McRae&#x27;s, with the Rev Houston giving the benediction. McRae&#x27;s niece and nephews performed the tune Highland Cathedral, a popular funeral song. The song &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; by Otis Redding, a favourite song of McRae&#x27;s, was played when the family entered the chapel. The Proclaimers&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m on My Way&quot; was played when they left. Colin and Johnny McRae were cremated in the same coffin. Among the attendees at the funeral were fellow Scottish racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Dario Franchitti.

A &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; service took place at St Nicholas Church in Lanark on Sunday 30 September at 4 p.m. Images from McRae&#x27;s career and personal life were displayed on large video screens outside the church. Around 700 mourners filled the church, with crowds of up to 15,000 outside. Shortly before 4 p.m., Martin Hewins, McRae&#x27;s personal bagpiper for many years, played &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; as the family arrived at the church. The service was conducted by the Rev Alison Meikle, who said &quot;Two weeks ago Lanark was struck by silence. A terrible silence bought at an enormous price. However, in our tears love is stronger than death.&quot; Later, the Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton song &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, a favourite of Johnny&#x27;s, was played. Friends of the pair shared poems and anecdotes from the McRaes&#x27; lives. After the service, Colin McRae&#x27;s widow, brother and father bowed and applauded the crowds who had gathered outside to pay tribute to the McRaes.

===Reaction===

The announcement of McRae&#x27;s death took place during qualifying for the 2007 Belgian Grand Prix with ITV commentator James Allen informing viewers of the news. Formula One driver David Coulthard, a friend of McRae, who was due to represent Scotland along with him in the Race of Champions at Wembley Stadium on 16 December, described him as &quot;an understated yet fantastically talented individual&quot;, and announced that he would race the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix with a helmet livery similar to McRae&#x27;s as a tribute. During the finale of the 2007 Scottish Rally Championship, the &quot;Colin McRae Forest Stages&quot; held in Perth in September 2007, there was no number-1 car, as McRae had been due to drive the course car on the event. Instead, his car was parked at the starting point of the rally, where fans were able to sign a book of condolences.

Following his win at the Brands Hatch meeting of the 2007 World Touring Car Championship season, Andy Priaulx dedicated it to McRae, commenting that his death &quot;shows how fragile life can be&quot;. McRae&#x27;s former rival, four-time World Rally Champion Tommi Mäkinen commented the helicopter accident as terrifying news, and described McRae as &quot;a pleasant fellow and a tough rival&quot;. Valentino Rossi, who was taught the basics of driving a rally car by McRae, said he was shocked and saddened by McRae&#x27;s death. He dedicated his win at the 2007 Portuguese motorcycle Grand Prix to McRae, saying &quot;I want to dedicate this to Colin McRae. He was one of my big idols when I was very young, and it&#x27;s because of him I have a big passion for rally&quot;.

===Investigation===
After the crash, an investigative team from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch attended the scene in cooperation with Strathclyde Police. The wreckage of the helicopter was removed to Farnborough for further forensic investigation. A report into the accident was published on 12 February 2009. In it, the AAIB did not reach a definite conclusion as to the cause of the accident, stating instead that &quot;the helicopter crashed in a wooded valley while manoeuvering at high speed and low height. It was intact before impact, and the available evidence indicated that the engine was delivering power. The cause of the accident was not positively determined. Although no technical reason was found to explain the accident, a technical fault could not be ruled out entirely. However, it is more likely that the pilot attempted a turning manoeuvre at a low height, during which the helicopter deviated from its intended flight path; whether due to the pilot encountering handling difficulties, misjudgement, spatial disorientation, distraction or a combination of such events. There were indications that the pilot had started recovery but, with insufficient height in which to complete it, the helicopter struck trees in the valley and crashed, killing all four occupants.&quot; The parents of Ben Porcelli had not given McRae permission to take their son in the helicopter.

A fatal accident inquiry into the incident concluded, on 6 September 2011, that McRae was at fault for the avoidable helicopter crash that led to his death and the death of his passengers. Sheriff Nikola Stewart stated, after the 16-day inquiry, that McRae had been engaged in &quot;unnecessary and unsafe&quot; low-level flying at the time of the crash, and that as a private pilot McRae was unqualified and untrained to fly at such a level. McRae&#x27;s flying licence was also found to have expired in 2005, and his &quot;valid type rating&quot; for the helicopter had expired in March 2007.

===Legacy===
In memory of McRae, the Swedish Rally organisers set up an award for the longest jump over a crest on the Vargåsen stage of the rally. The inaugural winner of the award, named &quot;Colin&#x27;s Crest&quot;, was Ford&#x27;s United Arab Emirates driver Khalid al-Qassimi, who recorded a distance of 30 m.
On 27 September 2008, the &quot;Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally&quot; took place in Perth, Scotland. An enhanced entry list of several former big-name rally drivers took part in McRae&#x27;s memory. The entry list included ex-World Championship drivers Hannu Mikkola, Ari Vatanen (partnered by his 1981 WRC winning co-driver David Richards), Björn Waldegård, Malcolm Wilson, Russell Brookes, Jimmy McRae, Andrew Cowan and Louise Aitken-Walker, many competing in their original cars. A handful of current WRC drivers also took part including Matthew Wilson, Kris Meeke and Travis Pastrana. The outright winner was Stobart VK M-Sport Ford Rally Team driver Matthew Wilson in a Ford Focus WRC. McRae&#x27;s brother Alister McRae won the classic category.

In November 2008 McRae was posthumously inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2015, 20 years from when McRae won the 1995 WRC Championship, an exhibition of memorabilia, including cars, was displayed at a service park at 2015 Rally GB.

In November 2020, a documentary celebrating the 25th anniversary of McRae&#x27;s WRC win was released.

Kenyan race car driver McRae Kimathi is named after him.

== &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; video game series ==

Codemasters released the first &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; video game in 1998. Version &quot;2&quot;, known as &quot;Colin McRae Rally 2.0&quot;, was released in 2000, for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and Microsoft Windows; it was also ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002. A third version found a wide audience on Windows and Xbox. Versions &quot;04&quot; and &quot;2005&quot; arrived in 2004 on all major platforms. &quot;2005&quot; was also remade for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable and Nokia&#x27;s N-Gage.

&quot;Colin McRae: Dirt&quot; was the title for the next instalment of the series, which launched in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 edition was released in the UK on 14 September, the day before McRae&#x27;s death. An adaptation of the game for mobile phones was released by Codemasters Mobile.

&quot;Colin McRae: Dirt 2&quot; was released on the Wii on 8 September 2009, it released on PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on 11 September 2009, the PC version was released on 8 December 2009. This was the last mainline game in the series to bear the &#x27;Colin McRae&#x27; moniker.

On 27 June 2013, a remastered version of &quot;Colin McRae Rally 2.0&quot;, simply titled &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot;, was released for iOS devices, with ports to Android and Windows released in 2014.

== Colin McRae R4 ==

In 2003, McRae started designing a rally car named the McRae R4, which he debuted at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2007. It was designed to be an economic alternate to other rally cars, with an additional focus on safety.

Built by DJM Race Preparation, the McRae R4&#x27;s chassis is based on a steel safety cage with carbon panelling front and rear, and a steel-covered cockpit area. Suspension consists of twin wishbones with Proflex dampers. The process of designing the car was assisted by Codemasters, who created a 3D model of the car based on initial sketches done by DJM Motorsport. The bodywork of the car is loosely based on a first-generation Ford Ka bodyshell, deemed to be the optimal choice in terms of size, shape and weight. 

The engine is a naturally aspirated, four-cylinder, 2.5-litre Millington Diamond Engine producing 350 BHP. Transmission is via a six-speed gearbox, manual or semi-automatic, and by mechanical front and rear differentials with the option of mechanical or active central differential. The car can be produced in either two- or four-wheel-drive formats.

<text>Charles Henry Cooper (September 29, 1926 – February 5, 1984) was an American professional basketball player.

Cooper played college basketball for Duquesne University and was named an All-American. According to the November 18, 1950 issue of the &quot;Afro-American&quot; newspaper, he was the first Black &quot;basketer&quot; [sic] to be named an All-American college athlete. In 1950, Cooper and two others--Nat &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton and Earl Lloyd--became the first African-American players in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Cooper was also the first African-American to be drafted by an NBA team; he was chosen by the Boston Celtics with the first pick of the second round of the 1950 NBA Draft. In a six-season NBA career, Cooper played for the Celtics, the Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks, and the Fort Wayne Pistons, averaging 6.7 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. 

Cooper was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2019.

== Early life and college career ==
Cooper was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Daniel and Emma Cooper. Daniel was a mailman, and Emma was a school teacher. He attended Pittsburgh&#x27;s Westinghouse High School and graduated in 1944. For his senior year, he averaged more than 13 points per game and was an All-City first-team center. He then attended and played a semester of basketball for West Virginia State College (now University) before being drafted to serve in the United States Navy in the final stages of World War II.

Following his service, he enrolled at Duquesne University where he was an All-American, started all four years, and set the school record for total points with 990 in four seasons. During his time at Duquesne, the team had a 78–19 record and was invited to the then-prestigious National Invitation Tournament twice. He was a captain for the 1949–50 team, which was the first team from the university to be nationally ranked all season, finishing with a 23–6 record and ranked sixth nationally. 

== NBA career ==
 Coming out of college in 1950, Cooper signed with the Harlem Globetrotters. On April 25, 1950, he became the first African American drafted into the NBA when the Boston Celtics chose him with the 14th overall pick. Cooper was drafted by Celtics&#x27; owner Walter A. Brown, coached by the legendary Red Auerbach and a teammate of the great Bob Cousy. When officials from other teams learned of Boston&#x27;s interest in Cooper, they suggested he should not be drafted because he was black; however, Brown&#x27;s famous quote was: &quot;I don&#x27;t give a damn if he&#x27;s striped, plaid or polka dot. Boston takes Charles Cooper of Duquesne.&quot; Cooper made his NBA debut on November 1, 1950, against the Fort Wayne Pistons.

Cooper played four years with the Celtics, then was traded to the Milwaukee Hawks before ending his career as a member of the Ft. Wayne Pistons. After that, he spent a year playing for the Harlem Magicians, before injuring his back in a car crash and leaving basketball. During his NBA career, Cooper played a total of 409 games, scored 2,725 points for an average of 6.66 points per game, had 2,431 rebounds for an average of 5.9 per game, and had 733 assists for an average of 1.79 per game. As some statistics were not kept during that time, it is not known how many blocked shots, steals, or turnovers he had during his career.

== After the NBA ==
After his NBA career, Cooper graduated with a Master of Social Work from the University of Minnesota in 1960. He was married twice; first in 1951, and then in 1957 to Irva Lee (with whom he had four children). He worked to improve his hometown of Pittsburgh, serving on the Pittsburgh school board, and was appointed the director of parks and recreation for the city, becoming the first Black department head. He also helped the Pittsburgh National Bank&#x27;s affirmative action program as an urban affairs officer until he died in Pittsburgh at the age of 57 on February 5, 1984, of liver cancer at Forbes Hospice.

<text>USS &quot;Threadfin&quot; (SS-410), a , was the only vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the threadfin.

&quot;Threadfin&quot; was laid down on 18 March 1944 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 26 June 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Frank G. Fox, and commissioned on 30 August 1944.

Training and trials out of Portsmouth followed her final completion late in September. After transiting the Panama Canal in mid-November, the submarine reached Pearl Harbor early in December and conducted intensive training in preparation for her first war patrol.

== First war patrol ==

&quot;Threadfin&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 25 December. Early in January 1945, she reached her assigned patrol area in the waters just south of Kyūshū. There, she spent 30 of her 54 days at sea. She encountered numerous enemy aircraft, patrol craft, and fishing vessels, but only six targets worthy of a torpedo.

On 30 January, &quot;Threadfin&quot; sighted a large enemy patrol craft, but prudently allowed her to pass unmolested in the hope of drawing a bead on any merchant vessels for which she might be running interference. Presently, a 2000-ton coastal freighter escorted by two patrol vessels and a plane crossed her path. &quot;Threadfin&quot; fired a spread of six torpedoes from a range of about . At least one of them struck home, obscuring the target in smoke and steam. The cargoman probably sank; but &quot;Threadfin&quot; could not verify that result visually because the escorts drove her deep with a persistent, though ineffective, depth charge attack.

Two days later, the submarine encountered a Japanese . However, the enemy&#x27;s course changes kept &quot;Threadfin&quot; from gaining an advantageous attack setup, and the Japanese &quot;pig-boat&quot; disappeared in the distance. &quot;Threadfin&quot; next happened upon two freighters escorted by three patrol craft. This time, the small convoy&#x27;s position close inshore defied the American submarine&#x27;s efforts to attack.

The following day, she mistook another patrol vessel for a cargo ship and discovered her mistake in just enough time to make a deep dive to safety. That escapade also robbed her of a chance at a small convoy consisting of two small cargomen and two escorts. She sighted the convoy later when she returned to periscope depth; but, by then the ships had passed out of range. A week later, she launched six torpedoes at a minesweeper distant. In spite of an excellent fire-control solution, all six missed. They apparently ran too deeply. Three days later, she concluded a somewhat discouraging, but still successful, first war patrol at Midway Island.

== Second war patrol ==

Following a month there for refit and training, &quot;Threadfin&quot; embarked upon her second war patrol on 14 March. She initially joined a coordinated attack group composed of herself, and submarines and . During her five-day tour with that wolf pack, &quot;Threadfin&quot; made two attacks on enemy shipping. On the afternoon of 28 March, she came across two Japanese destroyer escort-type warships and apparently dispatched one with a single hit from a spread of six torpedoes. The stricken warship&#x27;s screws stopped while her colleague&#x27;s depth charge attack deprived &quot;Threadfin&quot; of definite knowledge of the ultimate result. That evening, the submarine tangled with a convoy composed of two small trawlers and four luggers. During the ensuing surface gun engagement, the submarine inflicted serious damage on two of the luggers, moderate damage on the trawlers, and minor damage on the remaining pair of luggers. Though disconcerting, the Japanese return fire proved ineffectual.

On 31 March, that group was dissolved, and &quot;Threadfin&quot; received orders to join and near Bungo Suido, the primary entrance to the Seto Inland Sea which separates Honshū from Kyūshū and Shikoku. The new attack group&#x27;s primary assignment was to guard against an undetected sortie of the remainder of Japan&#x27;s fleet during the Allied assault on Okinawa. On the evening of 6 April, &quot;Threadfin&quot; made radar contact with what later proved to be an enemy task force built around Japan&#x27;s super battleship, . Passing up a tempting opportunity in order to carry out her prime directive, &quot;Threadfin&quot; flashed the warning to Fifth Fleet headquarters afloat off Okinawa.

Completing that phase of her mission, the submarine tried desperately to regain attack position on the force, but its speed denied her a second chance. On the whole, however, her radio was probably more valuable than her torpedoes would have been. Her timely warning enabled the planes of Task Force 58 to ambush and sink &quot;Yamato&quot; and to destroy most of her consorts as well.

A second mission of the submarine consisted of lifeguard duty to rescue downed American airmen. Her first war patrol afforded her no opportunity to pursue such a humane mission; but, near the end of the second she rescued a half-drowned P-51 Mustang pilot. Though he had swallowed large quantities of water, artificial respiration soon brought him around. That proved to be the last noteworthy event of the patrol; and, after a refueling stop at Midway on 30 April, &quot;Threadfin&quot; concluded her second war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 May.

== Third war patrol ==

At Pearl Harbor, she underwent refit followed by a brief four-day training period before departing on her third and final war patrol. She stopped briefly at Guam for voyage repairs; then continued on to her assigned area in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. She closed her first victim, a three-masted schooner, to inspect her and determine her nationality. Finding her to be enemy-operated and worthy of attack, the submarine opened up with her five-inch (127 mm) deck gun. Fifteen hits later, the schooner vanished beneath the waves. &quot;Threadfin&quot; rescued nine crewmen from the schooner and learned that her victim had been bound for Dairen laden with coal. The next day, the submarine encountered a freighter sunk in shallow water and surrounded by small boats, apparently conducting some variety of salvage operations. She fired a single torpedo which caused the wreck to settle a further ten feet and which she hoped would suspend the suspected salvage operations. Closer inspection, however, indicated that the boats were fishing, not conducting salvage operations.

Soon thereafter, &quot;Threadfin&quot; sighted a four-masted cargo schooner and sank her in a gun attack. The following afternoon, her deck gun accounted for another cargo schooner. On the 19th, she stopped a group of five two-masted cargo junks for inspection but allowed them to continue their voyage after identifying them as friendly Chinese. The next night, she made a surface radar torpedo attack on an enemy ship shrouded by heavy fog. She loosed a spread of five torpedoes, of which two found their mark. The target sank within five minutes without ever being visually sighted from &quot;Threadfin&quot;.

The submarine concluded her offensive operations near the Strait of Tsushima. After a day of submerged patrolling without sighting a worthwhile target, she received word that night that submarine had come upon a patrol craft heading north and four small cargomen heading south. While &quot;Sea Robin&quot; took on the patrol craft, &quot;Threadfin&quot; hit the small convoy. During the ensuing night gun action, she sank two of the four tiny merchantmen and forced the other two into &quot;Sea Robin&quot;’s path. The two American submarines dispatched all four. On the return trip from her final war patrol, &quot;Threadfin&quot; rescued three survivors from a downed American flying boat and took them to Guam where she arrived on 27 July.

== Post-war activities ==

From 27 July to 12 August, the submarine refitted at Guam in preparation for her fourth war patrol, but that patrol never occurred. While she conducted post-refit training, the Japanese capitulation ended hostilities. On 18 August, she got underway from Guam to return to the United States. She transited the Panama Canal on 16 September and reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. Six days later, she tied up at the naval base at Staten Island, New York.

The balance of &quot;Threadfin&quot;’s 28-year career proved to be routine in nature. Initially, she operated out of New London, Connecticut, serving as a training platform for the officers and men learning the ropes at the Submarine School. That duty apparently lasted until December 1952, at which time the submarine was decommissioned to enter the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an extended conversion overhaul.

Over the next eight months, &quot;Threadfin&quot; received extensive modifications in an effort to make her more effective in underwater operations—more truly a submarine than simply a submersible. When she emerged from the shipyard the following summer, her hull had been streamlined and her sail modified. In addition, she lost one of her four diesel engines to make room for auxiliary equipment displaced by an expanded sonar facility. Finally, her underwater performance was boosted by the installation of two &quot;greater capacity&quot; batteries—they actually produced the same power as the old style batteries but in a smaller, lighter physical plant—and a snorkel for extended submerged cruising.

At the completion of her Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion, &quot;Threadfin&quot; was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 7 August 1953. In October, she conducted her post-conversion shakedown cruise and, early the following month, reported for duty as a unit of Submarine Squadron 4 at Key West, Florida.

Over the remaining 19 years of her career, &quot;Threadfin&quot; operated off the East Coast. She participated in several exercises each year and frequently conducted summer training cruises for United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen. Though based in Key West, she made visits to ports on the Gulf of Mexico such as New Orleans, Louisiana, and often ventured north to New London, Connecticut. In October 1962, she participated in President of the United States John F. Kennedy&#x27;s quarantine of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The following summer, the submarine made what, on the basis of sparse records, appears to be her only post-war overseas deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Actually, Threadfin made two 6th Fleet deployments of about 4 months each in 1970 and 1972. At the end of the 1972 deployment she was loaned to Turkey and did not return to the USA. The turnover occurred in Izmir.

==Turkish Navy service==

After successive years of routine operations in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Threadfin&quot; was placed out of commission on 18 August 1972 and transferred to Turkey that same day. She served in the Turkish Navy, on loan, as TCG &quot;Birinci İnönü&quot; (S346) (&quot;First Inonu&quot;) until the following summer. She was the third submarine of that name and commemorated the Turkish victory at the First Battle of İnönü in January 1921. On 1 August 1973, her name was struck from the American Naval Vessel Register. Two weeks later, the loan expired, she was returned to the United States Navy, and sold to Turkey. In mid-1998 she was still in active service in the Turkish Navy. She has reportedly been decommissioned since then.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Threadfin&quot; was awarded three battle stars for World War II service.

<text>In physics, a dyon is a hypothetical particle in 4-dimensional theories with both electric and magnetic charges. A dyon with a zero electric charge is usually referred to as a magnetic monopole. Many grand unified theories predict the existence of both magnetic monopoles and dyons.

Dyons were first proposed by Julian Schwinger in 1969 as a phenomenological alternative to
quarks. He extended the Dirac quantization condition to the dyon and used the model to predict the existence of a particle with the properties of the J/ψ meson prior to its discovery in 1974.

The allowed charges of dyons are restricted by the Dirac quantization condition. This states in particular that their magnetic charge must be integral, and that their electric charges must all be equal modulo 1. The Witten effect, demonstrated by Edward Witten in his 1979 paper, states that the electric charges of dyons must all be equal, modulo one, to the product of their magnetic charge and the theta angle of the theory. In particular, if a theory preserves CP symmetry then the electric charges of all dyons are integers.

<text>Geometry (1991) is an album by the American ambient and electronic musician Robert Rich. Although completed in 1988, this album was not released until three years later.

This album is more active and structured than any of his previous works. The music was inspired in part by the complex patterns of Islamic designs like those found at the Alhambra, and features complex just intonation. The first three tracks consist of complex layered sequences of electronic notes in rich, organic-sounding chime tones. Rich revisited this style in &quot;Gaudí&quot; (1991) and &quot;Electric Ladder&quot; (2006). Tracks 4 through 7 are slow textures that more common to Robert Rich’s work. The album ends with another active piece similar to the first three tracks.

Tracks 1, 2, 4 and 8 were mixed by Robert Rich and future collaborator Steve Roach at Roach’s studio in Venice, California. This album was released in a two CD set with &quot;Numena&quot; in 1997.

<text>The Turkish Naval Forces (), or Turkish Navy (), is the naval warfare service branch of the Turkish Armed Forces.

The modern naval traditions and customs of the Turkish Navy can be traced back to 10 July 1920, when it was established as the &quot;Directorate of Naval Affairs&quot; during the Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Since July 1949, the service has been officially known as the &quot;Turkish Naval Forces&quot;.

In 2008, the Turkish Navy had a reported active personnel strength of 48,600; this figure included an Amphibious Marines Brigade as well as several Special Forces and Commando detachments. As of early 2021, the navy operates a wide variety of ships and 60 maritime aircraft.

==History==
===Ottoman fleet after Mudros===
Following the demise of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I, on 3 November 1918, the fleet commander of the Ottoman Navy, rear admiral Arif Pasha, ordered all flags to be struck on all warships lying in the Golden Horn, and the Ottoman Navy ceased to exist. The major surface combatants of the former Ottoman fleet (totalling 62,000 tons) were rendered inactive by the Allies and in accordance with the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the warships were disarmed during the last week of 1918. The battleship and the cruisers and were substantially limited and kept inactive inside the Golden Horn by the occupying forces. Due to its larger size, the battlecruiser was transferred to the Gulf of İzmit on the grounds that she could adversely affect the sea traffic inside the Golden Horn; while her ammunition and guns were removed. During this period, only a small number of Ottoman Navy vessels were allowed by the Allies to remain on active coast guard duties and were released from internment on 26 February 1919; such as the torpedo boats &quot;Akhisar&quot; and &quot;Dıraç&quot; which patrolled the Sea of Marmara, the gunboat &quot;Hızır Reis&quot; which patrolled the Gulf of İzmir, and the minelayers and &quot;Tir-i Müjgan&quot; which conducted mine cleaning operations in the Gulf of Saros.

Before the Turkish War of Independence began, the &quot;Bahriye Nazırlığı&quot; (Naval Ministry) sent the gunboat &quot;Preveze&quot; to Sinop and the gunboat &quot;Aydın Reis&quot; to Trabzon in February 1919 for surveillance, reconnaissance and patrol duties. However, a lack of coal to fuel their propulsion systems caused the &quot;Preveze&quot; and &quot;Aydın Reis&quot; to remain in harbour until the end of 1919. During the early stages of the Turkish War of Independence, these two gunboats did not return to Istanbul, despite heavy pressure from the Ottoman government and the Allies. Instead, they were placed under the command of the Turkish liberation forces led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and headquartered in Ankara.

===Turkish War of Independence===

====Directorate of Naval Affairs====
A large number of the naval officers and students of the Naval Academy went to Anatolia for participating in the Turkish War of Independence. On 10 July 1920, the &quot;Directorate of Naval Affairs&quot; (&quot;Umur-u Bahriye Müdürlüğü&quot;) was founded in Ankara under the Ministry of National Defense and was given the duty of organizing and maintaining strategic logistical shipping through the Black Sea in order to provide the Turkish liberation forces in Anatolia with weapons and other supplies. All existing naval institutions in the parts of Anatolia that were administered by the Ankara government were assigned to this Directorate. The Directorate of Naval Affairs was extremely successful in organizing local surface units and volunteers and in forming an intelligence network to discover the movements of the enemy ships. As a result, logistic transportation was carried out effectively. The Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara made an agreement with the Soviet Union to procure supplies for the Turkish liberation forces. &quot;Aydın Reis&quot; left from Samsun (on 16 September 1920) and &quot;Preveze&quot; left from Trabzon (on 30 September 1920) for Novorossiysk in order to transport weapons, other supplies and financial aid to the Turkish liberation forces. The &quot;Trabzon Shipping Detachment&quot;, which was founded on 21 September 1920, was renamed as the &quot;Trabzon Naval Shipping Command&quot; with the directive issued by the Ministry of National Defense on 26 October 1920. On 1 January 1921, the Samsun Naval Command was formed. In the subsequent stages of the Turkish War of Independence, due to the growing need for maritime shipping and the increase in the quantity and quality of the units and small ships, the organizational structure of the Directorate of Naval Affairs was gradually extended.

In the same period, a number of Turkish civilian seamen formed a group under the name of the &quot;Naval Aid Organization&quot; (&quot;Muavenet-i Bahriye&quot;). This group secretly obtained cannons, light weapons, ammunition, landmines and ordnance from the former Ottoman military warehouses in Istanbul that were under the control of the occupying Allies and sent them to the Turkish liberation forces in Anatolia with civil water transportation crafts.

====Presidency of the Naval Department====
On 1 March 1921, the Directorate of Naval Affairs was transformed into the Presidency of the Naval Department (&quot;Bahriye Dairesi Reisliği&quot;) and had control over the Naval Commands in Samsun, Amasra and İzmit (formed on 28 June 1921); the Naval Transport Detachment in Trabzon; the Naval Transport Command in Ereğli; the Naval Detachment in Lake Eğirdir; and the Naval Liaison Group in Fethiye (formed on 16 March 1921.) During the War of Independence, Turkish naval forces transported 220,000 tons of weapons, ammunition and equipment to the land forces in Anatolia.

===Ministry of the Navy===
Following the Armistice of Mudanya on 11 October 1922, the former Ottoman Ministry of the Navy (&quot;Bahriye Nazırlığı&quot;) building in the Kasımpaşa quarter of Istanbul, on the Golden Horn, became the headquarters of the Istanbul Naval Command on 14 November 1922. The establishment of the Ministry of the Navy (&quot;Bahriye Vekâleti&quot;) of the Republic of Turkey, headquartered in Ankara, was decided by the Grand National Assembly on 29 December 1924, and Topçu İhsan Bey (İhsan Eryavuz) was appointed the first (and only) Naval Minister of Turkey. When the Republic of Turkey was established on 29 October 1923, the former Ottoman vessels that remained under Turkish control were as follows:

In active service: 2 cruisers (, &quot;Peyk-i Şevket&quot;), 2 yachts (&quot;Ertuğrul&quot;, &quot;Söğütlü&quot;), 1 destroyer (&quot;Taşoz&quot;), 4 gunboats (&quot;Burak Reis&quot;, &quot;Hızır Reis&quot;, &quot;Kemal Reis&quot;, &quot;İsa Reis&quot;), 1 minelayer (), 1 aviso (&quot;Galata&quot;), 4 tugs and 7 motorboats.
Out of service (needing repair): 2 battleships (, ), 2 cruisers (&quot;Berk-i Satvet&quot;, ), 4 destroyers (, &quot;Nümune-i Hamiyet&quot;, &quot;Basra&quot;, &quot;Samsun&quot;), 6 torpedo boats (, &quot;Yunus&quot;, &quot;Akhisar&quot;, &quot;Dıraç&quot;, &quot;Musul&quot;, &quot;Berk Efşan&quot;), 1 gunboat (&quot;Sakız&quot;).

Preparations were made to carry out the maintenance and overhaul of small-tonnage warships (the three &quot;Taşoz&quot;-class destroyers and the gunboats &quot;Burak Reis&quot;, &quot;Sakız&quot;, &quot;İsa Reis&quot; and &quot;Kemal Reis&quot;) and to make them combat-ready. Thus, the cruiser &quot;Hamidiye&quot;, which was planned to be employed as a Cadet Training Ship, was overhauled.

During the 1920s, a commitment to refurbish the battlecruiser (which remained in active service until 1950) as the centerpiece of the republic&#x27;s fleet was the only constant element of the various naval policies which were put forward. The battlecruiser remained in İzmit until 1926, in a neglected state: only two of her boilers worked, she could not steer or steam, and she still had two unrepaired scars from the mine damage in 1918. Enough money was raised to allow the purchase of a new floating dock from the German company &quot;Flender&quot;, as &quot;Yavuz&quot; could not be towed anywhere without risk of her sinking in rough seas. The French company &quot;Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire-Penhöet&quot; was contracted in December 1926 to oversee the subsequent refit, which was carried out by the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. Since the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 required the disarmament of the Turkish Straits, the infrastructures belonging to the Turkish Naval Forces on the Bosphorus (in Istinye) and on the Golden Horn were transferred to Gölcük. In this period, Gölcük was designated as the main Turkish naval base.

The overhaul works of TCG &quot;Yavuz&quot; proceeded over three years (1927–1930); they were delayed when several compartments of the dock collapsed while being pumped out. &quot;Yavuz&quot; was slightly damaged before she could be refloated and the dock had to be repaired before the overhaul works could be resumed. The Minister of the Navy, İhsan Eryavuz, was convicted of embezzlement in the resulting investigation which became known as the &quot;Yavuz-Havuz case&quot; (&quot;havuz&quot; meaning &quot;dock&quot; in Turkish naval engineering terminology.) The investigation revealed that Ihsan Eryavuz had reduced the insurance obligation of the French company (Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire-Penhöet) from 5 million to 1.5 million Turkish liras, and was convicted guilty of fraud, which resulted in the abolition of the Ministry of the Navy on 27 December 1927.

===Undersecretariat of the Sea===
Following the dissolution of the Ministry of the Navy, the naval forces were reorganized under the Ministry of National Defense and on 16 January 1928 the &quot;Undersecretariat of the Sea&quot; (&quot;Deniz Müsteşarlığı&quot;) was established in order to undertake the duties of the former Ministry of the Navy. With this new reorganization, the Turkish Fleet Command was put under the command of the Turkish General Staff in terms of administration and logistics. On 2 November 1930, the &quot;Naval War College&quot; (&quot;Deniz Harp Akademisi&quot;) commenced training and education of Staff Officers at its facilities in the Yıldız Palace. During World War II, the naval schools were temporarily relocated from Istanbul to Mersin for security reasons and conducted education and training activities in this city.

In 1933, with the approval of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Gölcük was designated as the main base of the Turkish Navy. In the same year, the first new ship built at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard, the tanker TCG &quot;Gölcük&quot;, was laid down; and launched the following year. With the signing of the Montreux Convention in 1936, Turkey&#x27;s sovereignty over the Turkish Straits was internationally recognized, and &quot;Fortified Area Commands&quot; were founded on the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, with Naval Detachments assigned to these Commands.

===Naval Forces Command===
The Turkish Naval Forces were represented under the title of the &quot;Naval Undersecreteriat&quot; at the Turkish General Staff Headquarters in Ankara from 1928 to 1949. The historic decree of the Higher Military Council on 15 August 1949 led to the foundation of the Turkish Naval Forces Command (&quot;Deniz Kuvvetleri Komutanlığı&quot;.) After Turkey joined NATO on 18 February 1952, the Turkish Naval Forces were integrated into the organizational branches of the alliance.

==Structure==
In 1961, the Turkish Naval Forces Command was organized into four main subordinate commands: The &quot;Turkish Fleet Command&quot;, the &quot;Turkish Northern Sea Area Command&quot;, the &quot;Turkish Southern Sea Area Command&quot; and the &quot;Turkish Naval Training Command&quot;. In 1995, the &quot;Turkish Naval Training Command&quot; was renamed as the &quot;Turkish Naval Training and Education Command.&quot;

==Equipment==
==Modernisation programmes==
The Turkish Navy is currently undergoing several modernisation programmes to replace its ageing equipment. As of 2023, the major modernisation projects are as follows:

=== Ships &amp; Submarines ===
==== MUGEM-class aircraft carrier ====
On 3 January 2024, the Turkish government approved the plan for the design and construction of a larger aircraft carrier, named the &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carrier.

On 15 February 2024, the Design and Projects Office of the Turkish Navy announced that it will be a STOBAR aircraft carrier with an overall length of , beam of , draught of , and displacement of 60,000 tons. It is to have a COGAG propulsion system and a maximum speed of more than .

The construction of the first &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carrier began on 2 January 2025. The first &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carrier is being built at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard.

==== Anadolu-class amphibious assault ship / drone carrier ====


 is a 27,079-tonne amphibious assault ship (LHD) and drone carrier of the Turkish Naval Forces that can be configured as a 24,660-tonne V/STOL aircraft carrier. Construction began on 30 April 2016 by Sedef Shipbuilding Inc. at their Istanbul shipyard. TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; was commissioned with a ceremony on 10 April 2023. The construction of a sister ship, to be named TCG &quot;Trakya&quot;, is currently being planned by the Turkish Navy.

The Sikorsky S-70B Seahawk and the Bell AH-1 SuperCobra are the two main types of helicopters used on TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot;, with the occasional use of CH-47F Chinook helicopters of the Turkish Army during military exercises and operations. The AH-1W Super Cobras will eventually be complemented and replaced by the TAI T929 ATAK 2.
The jet-powered, low-observable drone Bayraktar MIUS Kızılelma and the MALE UAV Bayraktar TB3 are two UCAVs that are specifically designed and manufactured by Baykar Technologies to be used on TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot;. The maiden flight of TAI Anka-3 (also part of Project MIUS), a jet-powered, flying wing type UCAV with stealth technology, was successfully completed on 28 December 2023.

On 19 November 2024, a Baykar Bayraktar TB3 UCAV successfully took-off from the flight deck of TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; and landed on the ship. It was the first time a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft of this size and class had successfully landed on a short-runway landing helicopter dock, without the use of an arresting gear.

TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; has a light cargo garage for TEU containers and 27 Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV); a dock which can host four Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) or two Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), or two Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP); and a garage for heavy loads, which can host 29 main battle tanks (MBT), Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and TEU containers. The ship is protected by the ARAS-2023 diver detection sonar (DDS). She has a crew of 261 personnel: 30 officers, 49 NCOs, 59 leading seamen, and 123 ratings.

The ship has a flight deck and a aviation hangar which can accommodate either 12 medium-sized helicopters or 8 Boeing CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. When the aviation hangar and the light cargo garage are unified, the ship can carry up to 25 medium-sized helicopters. Alternatively, the ship can carry up to 10 F-35B STOVL fighter jets and 12 medium-sized helicopters, with the possibility of hosting six more helicopters on the flight deck of the ship.

==== TF-2000-class air defense destroyer ====
The &quot;TF-2000&quot;-class destroyer is a projected anti-air warfare guided-missile destroyer currently undergoing development by the Turkish Naval Institute. The class will provide survivability in the presence of aerial threat and also support mission functions such as command, control, and communications, reconnaissance, early warning, surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare and electronic warfare. Moreover, once in service, the TF-2000s are slated to be an integral part of Türkiye&#x27;s expeditionary strike groups centered around the TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; LHD and the country&#x27;s future &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carriers. 

The construction of the first &quot;TF-2000&quot;-class destroyer, the first &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carrier, and the first &quot;MILDEN&quot;-class submarine began in the same day, on January 2, 2025. The first &quot;TF-2000&quot;-class destroyer and the first &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carrier are being built at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, while the first &quot;MILDEN&quot;-class submarine is being built at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard. Large capital vessels like the TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; and the &quot;MUGEM&quot;-class aircraft carriers require destroyer escorts to defend them against enemy aircraft, ships and submarines, a duty that will be undertaken by the &quot;TF-2000&quot;-class destroyers. 

On 5 December 2007, the Defence Industry Executive Committee approved plans to build six ships of this class (4 fixed, 2 optional). In January 2013, it was announced that Türkiye was planning to acquire a total of 8 TF-2000 destroyers, which was confirmed at the International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF) 2021. With the realization of the project, it is intended to improve the anti-air warfare (AAW) capabilities of the Turkish Navy.

==== İstif-class frigate ====


The &quot;İstif&quot;-class frigate programme was launched to construct four frigates to replace the aging &quot;Yavuz&quot;-class frigates in the mid-2020s. Developed under the MILGEM indigenous warship program, the &quot;İstif&quot;-class is an enlarged variant of the Ada-class anti-submarine warfare corvette. The &quot;İstif&quot;-class frigates will have around 50% increased fuel capacity and operational range capability compared to the Ada-class corvettes.

The first &quot;İstif&quot;-class frigate, was launched on 23 January 2021. TCG &quot;Istanbul&quot; (F-515) was commissioned on 19 January 2024.

The &quot;İstif&quot;-class frigates use Turkish systems such as the Aselsan CENK 3D multi-beam AESA radar, Roketsan MİDLAS VLS, Sapan SAM, SİPER SAM, and Atmaca SSM.

==== Barbaros-class frigate modernisation ====
On 3 April 2018, a contract was signed between the Aselsan–HAVELSAN joint venture and the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM) regarding the mid-life upgrade project of the &quot;Barbaros&quot;-class frigates. The project includes the integration of new weapons systems, a new combat management system, and new radars and sensors; together with the replacement of the original mast with an integrated mast and various upgrades. All four ships in the class are included in this project. The project is scheduled to be completed by 2025.

The first two &quot;Barbaros&quot;-class vessels (F-244, F-245) have received an 8-cell Mk41 vertical launcher system (VLS) module, which replaced the obsolete Mk.29 Sea Sparrow launcher, while the slightly longer &quot;Salihreis&quot;-subclass vessels (F-246, F-247) have received a second 8-cell Mk 41 VLS module which brought the total number of cells to 16 (they can store a total of 64 RIM-162 ESSM missiles). Additionally, the old AWS-9 3D air search radars in all four vessels have been replaced by the SMART-S Mk2 3D radars.

The mid-life modernisation program also projects to enhance EW capabilities, double the number of anti-ship missiles that the vessels are equipped with, while also replacing the Harpoon missiles by the locally designed and produced Atmaca anti-ship missiles. The project also includes the substitution of the Oerlikon Sea Zenith CIWS systems with one Phalanx CIWS and one Aselsan Gökdeniz CIWS; the replacement of the existing TACTICOS combat management system with the Havelsan &quot;B-SYS Combat Management System&quot;, and the installation of a 127mm main gun to the frigates. Finally, against asymmetric threats that the vessels may face, 2x2 L/UMTAS launchers will be integrated to the frigates.

==== G-class frigate modernisation ====
The G-class frigates of the Turkish Navy have undergone a major modernisation program which included the retrofitting of a Turkish digital combat management system named GENESIS (&quot;Gemi Entegre Savaş İdare Sistemi&quot;). The system was designed and implemented jointly by the Turkish Navy and HAVELSAN, a Turkish electronic hardware systems and software company. The GENESIS upgraded ships were delivered between 2007 and 2011.

The GENESIS advanced combat management system has the capacity of tracking more than 1,000 tactical targets, thanks to its digital sensor data fusion, automatic threat evaluation, weapon engagement opportunities and Link-16/22 system integration. 

The modernisation program also includes the addition of an 8-cell Mk.41 VLS for RIM-162 ESSM, together with the upgrade of the Mk-92 fire control system by Lockheed Martin; the retrofitting of the SMART-S Mk2 3D air search radar which replaced the AN/SPS-49; and the addition of a new long range sonar.

The Mk.41 vertical launching system (VLS) has been fitted in front of the Mk.13 launcher. TCG &quot;Gediz&quot; was the first ship in the class to receive the Mk.41 VLS installation.

The G-class frigates of the Turkish Navy were also modified with the ASIST landing platform system at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, so that they can accommodate the S-70B Seahawk helicopter in all types of weather conditions.

==== Preveze-class submarine modernisation ====
Half-life Modernisation Project of Preveze-class submarine covers the modernisation of TCG Preveze (S-353), TCG Sakarya (S-354), TCG 18 Mart (S-355) and TCG Anafartalar (S-356) submarines in the inventory of the Naval Forces Command. Modernisation activities are carried out by STM-ASELSAN-HAVELSAN and ASFAT Partnership.

In the modernisation process, it is planned to carry out the procurement activities of Inertial Navigation System, Salinity-Depth-Density Measurement System, Floating Antenna, Satellite Communication Mast, Assault and Navigation Periscope System, Emergency Underwater Communication System, Cooled Water System, Static Converter and Air Freshening System by STM.

==== Reis-class submarine ====
The Reis-class submarine class vessels are the first submarines in the Turkish Navy with air-independent propulsion (AIP), which is made possible by fuel cell technology. The submarines can also deploy heavyweight torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, and lay mines against targets, both at sea and on land.
Apart from Piri Reis, five more submarines of the project are expected to be commissioned by 2027. The sea trials of the first submarine of the class, Piri Reis, began on 6 December 2022. The outfitting of the project&#x27;s second submarine Hızır Reis and the hull production phases of two other vessels are ongoing.
In 2015, Gölcük Naval Shipyard commenced a 10-year programme to build six Type 214 submarines, locally known as the Reis-class submarines, with technology from Thyssen-Krupp Marine Systems of Germany.

==== MILDEN-class submarine ====
The MILDEN project (Turkish: &quot;Milli Denizaltı Projesi&quot;; English: &quot;National Submarine Project&quot;) is a multi-year military design and procurement project to develop indigenous air-independent power attack submarines, intended to be commissioned into the Turkish Naval Forces in the 2030s. The first MILDEN class submarine is being designed and built at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard, where the concept design was completed in 2022, and the preliminary design phase, in which the main and auxiliary systems will be elaborated in detail, began in September 2022. 

MILDEN is a diesel-electric submarine of approximately 2,700 tonnes displacement, and over in length.

The construction of the first &quot;MILDEN&quot;-class submarine started on January 2, 2025.

=== Aircraft, UAVs &amp; UCAVs ===
==== Bayraktar TB3 UCAV ====
 

In February 2021, chairman of the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) Ismail Demir made public a new type of UAV being developed by Baykar that is planned to be stationed to Turkey&#x27;s first drone-carrying amphibious assault ship, TCG Anadolu. The new aircraft being developed is a naval version of the Bayraktar TB2 equipped with a local engine developed by TEI. According to the initial plans the ship was expected to be equipped with F-35B fighter jets but following the removal of Turkey from the procurement program, the vessel got into a modification process to be able to accommodate UAVs. Mr. Demir stated that between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 UAVs will be able to land and take off using the deck of Anadolu.

On November 19, 2024, a Baykar Bayraktar TB3 UCAV successfully took-off from the flight deck of TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot; and landed on the ship. It was the first time a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft of this size and class had successfully landed on a short-runway landing helicopter dock, without the use of an arresting gear.

==== Baykar MIUS Kızılelma UCAV ====


Developed for the Turkish Navy and Turkish Air Force as part of Project MIUS, the jet-powered Bayraktar Kızılelma UCAV is designed to operate on TCG &quot;Anadolu&quot;. Its maiden flight took place on 14 December 2022.

===USVs===
==== ULAQ====
ULAQ is the first indigenous and locally developed Armed Unmanned Surface Vehicle (AUSV). The vehicle is being developed by a joint venture between Ares Shipyard and METEKSAN. The vessel is planned to be equipped with four Cirit and two L-UMTAS anti-tank missile systems provided by Roketsan. Moreover, ULAQ is projected to have a 400-kilometer-long cruising range with 65 km per hour maximum speed. The vessel is planned to be operated in missions such as reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence, surface warfare, asymmetric warfare, armed escort and force protection, and strategic facility security. Currently, the project is undergoing sea trials and will start to fire tests through the third quarter of 2021. First firing test of the vessel was completed on 26 May 2021 by destroying a designated target with Roketsan Cirit Missile.

====TCB Marlin====

At a ceremony held on 9 January 2024, she entered servis in the Turkish Naval Forces as the first Armed USV with the hull number TCB-1101 and name &quot;Marlin&quot; SİDA.

== Istanbul Naval Museum ==
The Istanbul Naval Museum is located in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul, Turkey. It was established in 1897 by the Ottoman Minister of the Navy (&quot;Bahriye Nazırı&quot;) Bozcaadalı Hasan Hüsnü Pasha.

The museum contains an important collection of military artifacts pertaining to the Ottoman Navy. In the maritime field, it is Turkey&#x27;s largest museum, with a great variety of collections. Around 20,000 pieces are present in its collection, including the late 16th or early 17th century Ottoman Navy galley known as &quot;Tarihi Kadırga&quot;, built in the period between the reigns of Sultan Murad III (1574–1595) and Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–1687), as evidenced by AMS radiocarbon dating and dendrochronological research. She is the only surviving original galley in the world, and has the world&#x27;s oldest continuously maintained wooden hull.

Being connected to the Turkish Naval Forces Command, it is also the country&#x27;s first military museum.

In the early 21st century a new exhibition building was constructed. The construction began in 2008, and the building was reopened on 4 October 2013. It has two floors above ground level and one basement floor, all covering .

The basement consists of diverse items like figureheads, ornaments of naval ships, ship models, and pieces of the Byzantine chain that was used for blocking the entrance of the Golden Horn during the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453. In the first and second floors, a large number of imperial and other caïques are exhibited.

Many exhibition items underwent special restoration and conservation works due to deformation of the raw materials caused by heat, light, humidity, atmospheric conditions, vandalism and other factors.

==Insignia==


* Non-Turkish speakers might like to know that OF3, OF2, and OR2 literally translates as &quot;Head of 1000&quot;, &quot;Head of 100&quot;, and &quot;Head of 10&quot;, respectively.

<doc id="1109946" wikidata="Q445546" url="?curid=1109946" title="Balance theory">
<text>In the psychology of motivation, balance theory is a theory of attitude change, proposed by Fritz Heider. It conceptualizes the cognitive consistency motive as a drive toward psychological balance. The consistency motive is the urge to maintain one&#x27;s values and beliefs over time. Heider proposed that &quot;sentiment&quot; or liking relationships are balanced if the affect valence in a system multiplies out to a positive result.

Research in 2020 provided neuroscientific evidence supporting Heider&#x27;s balance theory. A study using neuroimaging techniques found distinct differences in brain activation when individuals were exposed to unbalanced versus balanced triads. These differences were observed in brain regions associated with processing cognitive dissonance, offering biological support for Heider&#x27;s original psychological explanation of balance theory in social context. 

Structural balance theory in social network analysis is the extension proposed by Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary. It was the framework for the discussion at a Dartmouth College symposium in September 1975.

==P-O-X model==

For example: a Person (formula_1) who likes (formula_2) an Other (formula_3) person will be balanced by the same valence attitude on behalf of the other. Symbolically, formula_4 and formula_5 results in psychological balance.

This can be extended to things or objects (formula_6) as well, thus introducing triadic relationships. If a person formula_1 likes object formula_6 but dislikes other person formula_3, what does formula_1 feel upon learning that person formula_3 created the object formula_6? This is symbolized as such:
*formula_13
*formula_14
*formula_15

Cognitive balance is achieved when there are three positive links or two negatives with one positive. Two positive links and one negative like the example above creates imbalance or cognitive dissonance.

Multiplying the signs shows that the person will perceive imbalance (a negative multiplicative product) in this relationship, and will be motivated to correct the imbalance somehow. The Person can either:
* Decide that formula_3 isn&#x27;t so bad after all,
* Decide that formula_6 isn&#x27;t as great as originally thought, or
* Conclude that formula_3 couldn&#x27;t really have made formula_6.

Any of these will result in psychological balance, thus resolving the dilemma and satisfying the drive. (Person formula_1 could also avoid object formula_6 and other person formula_3 entirely, lessening the stress created by psychological imbalance.)

To predict the outcome of a situation using Heider&#x27;s balance theory, one must weigh the effects of all the potential results, and the one requiring the least amount of effort will be the likely outcome.

Determining if the triad is balanced is simple math:

formula_23; Balanced.

formula_24; Balanced.

formula_25; Unbalanced.

==Examples==
Balance theory is useful in examining how celebrity endorsement affects consumers&#x27; attitudes toward products. If a person likes a celebrity and perceives (due to the endorsement) that said celebrity likes a product, said person will tend to like the product more, in order to achieve psychological balance.

However, if the person already had a dislike for the product being endorsed by the celebrity, they may begin disliking the celebrity, again to achieve psychological balance.

Heider&#x27;s balance theory can explain why holding the same negative attitudes of others promotes closeness. See The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

==Signed graphs and social networks==
Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary looked at Heider&#x27;s triads as 3-cycles in a signed graph. The sign of a path in a graph is the product of the signs of its edges. They considered cycles in a signed graph representing a social network.
: A balanced signed graph has only cycles of positive sign.
Harary proved that a balanced graph is polarized, that is, it decomposes into two entirely positive subgraphs that are joined by negative edges.

In the interest of realism, a weaker property was suggested by Davis:
:No cycle has exactly one negative edge.
Graphs with this property may decompose into more than two entirely positive subgraphs, called clusters. The property has been called the &quot;clusterability axiom&quot;. Then balanced graphs are recovered by assuming the 
: Parsimony axiom: The subgraph of positive edges has at most two components.

The significance of balance theory for social dynamics was expressed by Anatol Rapoport:
:The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will tend to change in such a way that one&#x27;s friends&#x27; friends will tend to become one&#x27;s friends and one&#x27;s enemies&#x27; enemies also one&#x27;s friends, and one&#x27;s enemies&#x27; friends and one&#x27;s friends&#x27; enemies will tend to become one&#x27;s enemies, and moreover, that these changes tend to operate even across several removes (one&#x27;s friends&#x27; friends&#x27; enemies&#x27; enemies tend to become friends by an iterative process).
Note that a triangle of three mutual enemies makes a clusterable graph but not a balanced one. Therefore, in a clusterable network one cannot conclude that &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; although this aphorism is a fact in a balanced network.

===Criticism===
Claude Flament expressed a limit to balance theory imposed by reconciling weak ties with relationships of stronger force such as family bonds:
:One might think that a valued algebraic graph is necessary to represent psycho-social reality, if it is to take into account the degree of intensity of interpersonal relationships. But in fact it then seems hardly possible to define the balance of a graph, not for mathematical but for psychological reasons. If the relationship &quot;AB&quot; is +3, the relationship &quot;BC&quot; is –4, what should the &quot;AC&quot; relationship be in order that the triangle be balanced? The psychological hypotheses are wanting, or rather they are numerous and little justified.

At the 1975 Dartmouth College colloquium on balance theory, Bo Anderson struck at the heart of the notion:
:In graph theory there exists a &quot;formal&quot; balance theory that contains theorems that are &quot;analytically&quot; true. The statement that Heider&#x27;s &quot;psychological&quot; balance can be represented, in its essential aspects, by a suitable interpretation of that &quot;formal balance theory&quot; should, however, be regarded as problematical. We cannot routinely identify the positive and negative lines in the formal theory with the positive and negative &quot;sentiment relations&quot;, and identify the formal balance notion with the &quot;psychological&quot; idea of balance or structural tension. .. It is puzzling that the fine structure of the relationships between formal and psychological balance has been given scant attention by balance theorists.

<doc id="1109948" wikidata="Q6550345" url="?curid=1109948" title="Lincoln's Birthday">
<text>Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday is a public holiday in some U.S. states, observed on the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birth on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, California, Missouri, and New York observe the holiday.

In many other states, Lincoln&#x27;s birthday is not celebrated separately, as a stand-alone holiday. Instead, Lincoln&#x27;s birthday is combined with a celebration of President George Washington&#x27;s birthday (also in February) and celebrated either along with the Federal holiday of Washington&#x27;s Birthday or as Presidents&#x27; Day on the third Monday in February.

==History==
The earliest known observance of Lincoln&#x27;s birthday occurred in Buffalo, New York, in either 1873 or 1874. Julius Francis (d. 1881), a Buffalo druggist, made it his life&#x27;s mission to honor the slain president. He repeatedly petitioned Congress to establish Lincoln&#x27;s birthday as a legal holiday.

The day is marked by traditional wreath-laying ceremonies at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky, and at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The latter has been the site of a ceremony ever since the Memorial was dedicated. Since that event in 1922, observances continue to be organized by the Lincoln Birthday National Commemorative Committee and by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). A wreath is laid on behalf of the President of the United States, a custom also carried out at the grave sites of all deceased U.S. presidents on their birthdays. Lincoln&#x27;s tomb is in Springfield, Illinois.

On February 12, 2009, the annual wreath-laying ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial commemorated Lincoln&#x27;s 200th birthday in grand fashion. An extended ceremony, organized by the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC) and with help from MOLLUS, featured musical performances from four-time Grammy-nominated singer Michael Feinstein and the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The morning celebration also featured remarks by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin; Lincoln scholar and ALBC Co-chair Harold Holzer; recently retired Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice – and ALBC Commissioner – Frank J. Williams; and author Nikki Giovanni reciting her newest work, which was written especially for the .

As part of Lincoln&#x27;s birthday bicentennial, the U.S. Mint released four new Lincoln cents. The commemorative coins have new designs on the reverse showing stages of his life. The first went into circulation on September 12, 2009. The standard portrait of Lincoln&#x27;s head remains on the front. The new designs include a log cabin representing his birthplace, Lincoln as a young man reading while sitting on a log that he was taking a break from splitting, Lincoln as a state legislator in front of the Illinois Capitol, and the partially built dome of the U.S. Capitol.

New Jersey started observing the holiday on May 23, 2008, with the enactment of the Public Employee Pension and Benefits Reform Act of 2008.

===Origin of Black History Month===
Black History Month has its origin in 19th-century celebrations of Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday by African-American communities in the United States. By the early 20th century, black communities were annually celebrating Lincoln&#x27;s birthday in conjunction with the birthday of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass on February 14. The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History announced that the second week of February would be &quot;Negro History Week&quot; to coincide with the traditional Black commemorations of both men&#x27;s birthdays. By the 1970s, &quot;Negro History Week&quot; had become &quot;Black History Month&quot;. Black History Month has expanded further to Canada, where it is also celebrated in February, and to the United Kingdom, which celebrates it in October.

==Official government holidays==
Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday was never a U.S. Federal Government holiday. The third Monday in February remains only &quot;Washington&#x27;s Birthday&quot; in federal law. However, many state governments have officially renamed their Washington&#x27;s Birthday state holiday as &quot;Presidents&#x27; Day&quot;, &quot;Washington and Lincoln Day&quot;, or other such designations which explicitly or implicitly celebrate Lincoln&#x27;s birthday. Regardless of the official name and purpose, celebrations and commemorations on or about the third Monday often include honoring Lincoln.

In Connecticut, Missouri and Illinois, while Washington&#x27;s Birthday is a federal holiday, Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday is still a state holiday, falling on February 12 regardless of the day of the week. California still lists Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday as a holiday, but as of 2009 no longer gives State employees a paid holiday on February 12. However, it is considered a &quot;Court holiday&quot; and state courts are closed.

In the following states, the third Monday in February is an official state holiday and known as:

&quot;Using &quot;president&quot;&quot;
* Presidents&#x27; Day in Hawaii, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, and Washington
* President&#x27;s Day in Alaska, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wyoming
* Presidents Day in Nevada, New Jersey, and Oregon
* Washington&#x27;s Birthday/President&#x27;s Day in Maine
* Lincoln/Washington/Presidents&#x27; Day in Arizona

&quot;Washington and Lincoln&quot;
* Washington and Lincoln Day in Utah
* Washington–Lincoln Day in Colorado and Ohio
* Washington&#x27;s and Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday in Indiana
* Lincoln&#x27;s and Washington&#x27;s Birthday in Montana
* Washington&#x27;s and Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday in Minnesota

&quot;Washington alone&quot;
* George Washington Day in Virginia

&quot;Washington and another person&quot;
* George Washington/Thomas Jefferson Birthday in Alabama
* George Washington&#x27;s Birthday and Daisy Gatson Bates Day in Arkansas

&quot;Unspecified&quot;
* &quot;The third Monday in February&quot; in California.

Several states honor presidents with official state holidays that do not fall on the third Monday of February. In New Mexico, Presidents&#x27; Day, at least as a state-government paid holiday, is observed on the Friday following Thanksgiving. In Georgia, Presidents&#x27; Day, at least as a state-government paid holiday, is observed on Christmas Eve. (Observed on the prior Thursday if Christmas falls on Saturday; observed on the prior Friday if Christmas falls on a Sunday. If December 24 is a Wednesday, then this holiday is observed on Friday December 26.)

<text>Jason Scott Marquis (; born August 21, 1978) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, and Cincinnati Reds. He also played for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic, serving as the team&#x27;s ace.

As a 12-year-old, Marquis pitched his team to third place in the Little League World Series with a no-hitter. He is one of only a few ballplayers to have played in both a Little League World Series and a Major League World Series. He also pitched his high school team to consecutive New York City baseball championships. Marquis was drafted in the first round out of high school by the world champion Atlanta Braves, and reached the majors as a 21-year-old in 2000.

As a major leaguer, Marquis won 11 or more games for six straight years through 2009, and also started 28 or more games in each of the years 2004–09. His 65 wins from 2004 to 2008 ranked 7th among N.L. pitchers. He pitched on a World Series champion in 2006, and was an All-Star in 2009. Through 2011, in his career in games that were late and close, Marquis held batters to a .228 batting average. He also excelled with the bat, winning the Silver Slugger Award in 2005. He pitched for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

==Early life==
Marquis was born in Manhasset, New York, and grew up in Staten Island&#x27;s Arden Heights neighborhood, where he attended Paulo Intermediate School 75. His mother works for the New York City Board of Education, and has a teaching degree, while his father owns a check cashing business in Brooklyn. He was a New York Yankees fan growing up, and Don Mattingly was his favorite player.

Marquis, who is Jewish, grew up in a Conservative Jewish home, attended Hebrew school, and observes the major Jewish holidays. &quot;My mother was a bit more stricter with our Jewish upbringing,&quot; said Marquis, &quot;given that her parents were Holocaust survivors.&quot; Marquis was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published in affiliation with Fleer Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society, commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ian Kinsler, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Scott Feldman, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, Jason Hirsh, and Scott Schoeneweis. Through 2014, he was third all-time in career wins and strikeouts (behind Ken Holtzman and Sandy Koufax in both categories) among Jewish major league baseball players.

===Little League World Series===
Marquis starred in Little League Baseball on the South Shore Little League team that finished second in the US, and third in the world, in the Little League World Series in 1991. He led his team to a victory in the first round over the Ohio team on his 13th birthday.

His team lost to California in the US final on ESPN, as Marquis was relegated to shortstop because Little Leaguers weren&#x27;t allowed to pitch two days in a row. Marquis then led his team to victory over Canada in the third-place game, throwing a no-hitter. &quot;Playing in front of that many people at that time in my life made me realize this is what I wanted to do with my life,&quot; said Marquis, &quot;and I was going to work my hardest to get it.&quot; As of September 2021, he was one of over 50 Little League World Series players to have reached the major leagues.

===High school===
&quot;When I was a freshman [in high school] I was , and everyone thought I was too small to play,&quot; Marquis said. &quot;But it was always my dream to play major league baseball, and I&#x27;ve always worked very hard at it.&quot; As a junior and senior, however, Marquis threw a 93 miles per hour fastball, a curveball that was nearly unhittable at the high school level, and a changeup. He pitched the Tottenville High School Pirates to two consecutive New York City Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) titles. The first was a Pirates (22–1) championship in 1995 over the George Washington Trojans (32–3), 3–2 at Shea Stadium, capping a season in which he posted an 11–0 record while striking out 86 batters in 61 innings.

The second championship was in 1996 when the Pirates were 33–1; again over the George Washington Trojans (41–2). He pitched his team to a 5–1, 7-inning complete game victory in which he struck out 15 batters and did not allow any earned runs, while he himself hit a two-run triple, at Yankee Stadium. That capped a season in which he was 14–1 with a 0.40 ERA, and struck out 150 in 79 innings, while as a batter he tied a school season record with 11 home runs, drove in 45 runs, and batted .468.

He received the Iron Horse Award as the top baseball player in the PSAL and &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; Player of the Year Award. Marquis was named to the All-America Second Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings. Anthony McCarron of &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; touted him as &quot;perhaps the city&#x27;s best high school player since ... Manny Ramirez,&quot; and &quot;Baseball America&quot; ranked him the 39th-highest prospect in the nation. He also played basketball at Tottenville, and on the academic side was a member of the National Honor Society. He was a teammate on the baseball team with Anaheim Angels catcher Tom Gregorio. One of his classmates at Tottenville was Chicago Bears defensive end Adewale Ogunleye.

===Draft===
The right-hander originally signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Miami, which offered him a scholarship. A message was relayed he had been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round, the 35th selection overall. Marquis was excited, his team won the game and went on to win the city championship. He then opted out of his letter of intent and signed with the Braves on July 18, 1996, for a reported $600,000 ($ today) signing bonus.

==Minor league career==
In 1996 Marquis began his pro career with the Danville Braves (Rookie Advanced) in the Appalachian League, going 1–1 with a 4.63 ERA in 7 games. He had 24 strikeouts and gave up seven walks in 23 innings.

The next year he tied for the South Atlantic League lead with a team-record 14 victories for the Macon Braves (which tied for the league lead), as he went 14–10 with a 4.38 ERA, tied for second in the league with 28 starts, and was named the Braves&#x27; fifth-rated prospect by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;s like a man on a mission to get to the big leagues,&quot; said Mark Ross, the Macon pitching coach. &quot;He&#x27;s doing great.&quot;

In 1998, he began the season as youngest pitcher in the Carolina League, but won only two of 22 starts for Class A Danville 97s, as he went 2–12 and struck out 135 (8th in the league) in 114.2 innings, while walking only 41.

Marquis began the 1999 season at Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina League, where he opened the season by firing 20.0 consecutive scoreless innings. Marquis was named &quot;Baseball America&quot; Carolina League Player of the Week for the period April 15–21, as he pitched 10.0 innings, striking out 11. He allowed only one earned run in six starts (3–0, 0.28 ERA) before being promoted on May 10 to the Double-A Greenville Braves, and was named the Braves&#x27; sixth-rated prospect by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. With Greenville he went 3–4, 4.58 in 12 starts. He spent much of the summer on the disabled list (DL) with a sore elbow, a tender right shoulder, and a pulled oblique stomach muscle.

In 2000 &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him the Braves&#x27; fifth-rated prospect, and he split time between Double-A Greenville (going 4–2 with a 3.57 ERA), the Triple-A Richmond Braves, and Atlanta (15 games in relief; a 5.01 ERA). Marquis spent much of 2003 back in the minors with Richmond, and had a record of 8–4 with a 3.35 ERA in 15 starts.

==Major league career==

===Atlanta Braves (2000–03)===
Marquis was called up to the majors by the Braves in June 2000, at the age of 21 the 10th-youngest player in the NL, after the Braves demoted struggling closer John Rocker for threatening a reporter. He made his debut on June 6, 2000, in relief of Tom Glavine against the Toronto Blue Jays. &quot;Getting that first call and running out to the mound,&quot; said Marquis, &quot;I promise you I didn&#x27;t feel my legs at all.&quot; He was later sent back down to AAA Richmond, but was recalled again in September. During the 2000 season he appeared strictly in relief, finishing seven games in his 15 appearances, and winning one.

He became a starting pitcher in 2001, joining a celebrated staff with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Kevin Millwood. The 9/11 attack that interrupted the season also led to the death of one of his Little League World Series teammates, Michael Cammarata, a firefighter. &quot;It&#x27;s tough knowing that people died who were part of your life at one point,&quot; Marquis said. Marquis was the starting pitcher for the Braves in the first game played in New York City after 9/11.

In his first year as a starter, Marquis held batters to a .145 batting average with runners in scoring position and two out. The club&#x27;s front office made it clear that he was off-limits in trade talks, saying: &quot;He&#x27;s going to be a big-time No. 1 pitcher. You don&#x27;t give up an arm like that.&quot; He maintained a spot on the rotation again in 2002 as the fifth starter, behind Maddux, Glavine, Millwood, and Damian Moss.

In 2003, the Braves revamped their starting rotation with the acquisitions of Mike Hampton, Russ Ortiz, Shane Reynolds, and the promotion of Horacio Ramírez from AA. Marquis was sent to the bullpen. Ultimately, he split his season, making only 2 starts in 21 appearances for Atlanta, while starting 15 games for Richmond in AAA.

On December 13, 2003, Marquis was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals along with relief pitcher Ray King and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright for outfielder J. D. Drew and catcher Eli Marrero. Looking back years later, Marquis said: &quot;I was pretty young ... and I think it really shook me, to realize that nothing was forever.&quot;

===St. Louis Cardinals (2004–06)===
Marquis became a full-time starter in 2004 with the Cardinals, and came under the wing of pitching coach Dave Duncan who observed that Marquis &quot;always had a devastating skinner (sinker), and ... needs to get back to it more.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s just the pitch I had growing up, and I got away from it,&quot; Marquis said. Marquis strung together a Cardinals&#x27; season-high 11-game winning streak from May 31–September 4, the longest by a Cards pitcher since 1985 when John Tudor also won 11 straight games. He had a shutout streak of innings from August 24–September 10. On the business side, the Cardinals players elected him their #2 representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association.

For the season, Marquis posted a career-best 15–9 record, with a 3.71 ERA and a career-high 138 strikeouts, for the National League champions. He was 2nd in the NL in ground ball/fly ball ratio (2.17), tied for 5th in percentage of strikes that were &quot;looking&quot; (31%), 6th in pitches per start (104), 8th in won-lost percentage (.682), 9th in wins (15), and tied for 10th in double plays induced (21). He held batters to a .198 batting average with runners in scoring position, and a .163 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position.

Marquis tossed a scoreless inning of relief in Game 2 of the 2004 World Series at Boston, and Manager Tony La Russa tabbed Marquis to start Game 4. He turned in the best performance of any Cardinals starter in the series, pitching six innings and giving up three runs. He was bested, however, by Boston pitcher Derek Lowe, who threw shutout ball for seven innings to win the series for the Red Sox. &quot;Whether you lose 100 games or win 100 games and go to the World Series, the last day of the season you&#x27;re still looking around and saying, &#x27;The season is over? What do I do now?&#x27; &quot; said Marquis as he stuffed jerseys into a duffel bag. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to handle.&quot;

Marquis had an up-and-down season in 2005. Although he started the season strong, he slid into a personal seven-game losing streak. It ended on August 27, 2005, when Marquis pitched a two-hitter against the Washington Nationals, for his first career shutout. Overall Marquis posted a 13–14 record, with a 4.13 ERA in 207 innings pitched. He appeared in 33 games, starting 32, and completing 3 (6th in the NL). He gave up the second-lowest percentage of line drives in the NL (17.3%), induced 29 double plays (T-4th in the league), and was 4th with 1.26 GIDP/9 IP.

In the postseason he worked out of the bullpen in the NLCS, after not being used in the Division Series, and pitched in three games, finished with a 3.38 ERA.

In January 2006, Marquis and the Cardinals agreed to a one-year contract for $5.15 million, avoiding salary arbitration. The season started off well for Marquis, as on July 23 he became the first NL pitcher to win 12 games, raising his record to 12–7. But Marquis followed with a losing second half of the season. Pitching in the starting rotation all year, Marquis finished 14–16, but with a 6.02 ERA, the 2nd-worst in baseball among players who qualified for the ERA title (Joel Piñeiro, of the Seattle Mariners, finished last with a 6.36 ERA). He led the majors in runs allowed (136), and led the NL in losses (16) and home runs allowed (35). &quot;Obviously, those were tough pills to swallow,&quot; Marquis said. &quot;I took one for the team.&quot; On the other hand, in games that were late and close, he held batters to a .188 batting average. Marquis did not pitch in the postseason, but despite that, his teammates still voted him a full playoff/World Series share. He was also given a World Series ring.

===Chicago Cubs (2007–08)===

In December 2006 Marquis signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Cubs worth $21 million. With the Cubs, he wore his favorite # 21, the number formerly worn by ex-Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who coincidentally hit his 600th home run against Marquis. This caused some concern, due to Sosa&#x27;s accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs&#x27; all-time home run leader.

On May 9, Marquis completed a three-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates, defeating them 1–0. He had a perfect game going into the 6th inning, retiring the first 16 batters he faced, but Pirates shortstop Don Kelly broke it up with a single. The game took only two hours and six minutes. Marquis struck out five, and needed only 109 pitches to complete the game. &quot;His ball was diving and darting. He was awesome,&quot; said teammate Jacque Jones. The win improved Marquis&#x27; record to 5–1, and dropped his ERA to 1.70, 3rd-best in the NL. After the game, Marquis highlighted his consistency as being the key to his turnaround. &quot;My delivery is as consistent as it&#x27;s ever been. I feel like I&#x27;m repeating the same delivery over and over again and that&#x27;s the reason, I really believe, for the success.&quot;

In 2007 Marquis was 12–9, with a 4.60 ERA. He was tied for 2nd in the league in shutouts (1), was 5th in the league in hit batsmen (13), had the 5th-lowest batting average in the NL of balls hit into play against him (.280), and had the 8th-highest ground ball percentage (49.5%). He kept batters to a .229 batting average in games that were late and close.

On March 24, 2008, it was announced he would be the Cubs&#x27; fifth starter for the 2008 season. Historically, Marquis&#x27; numbers during the second half of the season were not as good as his numbers during the first half, but thanks to smart managing by Lou Piniella, Marquis and Rich Harden, newly acquired from the Oakland Athletics on July 8, rotated their starts for a time, and Marquis posted a winning month of August, going 3–1 with a 3.90 ERA. It was his second-lowest ERA after a 3.81 ERA in July. He finished the season 11–9, with a 4.53 ERA, and held batters to a .192 batting average with two outs and runners in scoring position.

On September 26, 2008, the Cubs postseason roster was announced, and Marquis was granted a roster spot as a reliever. Marquis thereby reached the playoffs in all nine of his major league seasons through 2008. He made one appearance against the Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series, when he pitched the top of the ninth inning. In it he gave up a solo home run to Russell Martin for the Dodgers&#x27; seventh and final run of the game — one they&#x27;d win by a final score of 7–2.

===Colorado Rockies (2009)===
On January 6, 2009, Marquis was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Luis Vizcaíno. General Manager Dan O&#x27;Dowd said: &quot;We like (Marquis&#x27;) athleticism, age and durability.&quot;

During the off-season, Marquis tweaked his delivery to improve his release point by staying over the rubber longer in his balance point, allowing his arm to catch up, resulting in a 2 to 3 inches longer stride, and leaving him on top of the ball and throwing downhill. Reporters attributed his first-half success to his new delivery and his high ground ball ratio.

On June 30 Marquis pitched a two-hit, no walk, 17-ground-ball-outs, 86-pitch shutout to become the first 10-game winner in the NL. A reporter for &quot;MLB.com&quot; called it &quot;one of the best pitching performances in Rockies history,&quot; and Rob Neyer of &quot;ESPN&quot; described Marquis that night as &quot;Bob Gibson, Orel Hershiser, and Greg Maddux all rolled into one&quot;. He beat the LA Dodgers, which had the best record in the major leagues, and outpitched their ace Chad Billingsley 3–0 in a matchup of pitchers leading the league in wins. It was his third career shutout, and his second complete game of the season. He also drove in two of his team&#x27;s three runs. &quot;That was something special, as good as I have seen in my years behind this desk,&quot; said Rockies manager Jim Tracy.

On July 5, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who managed the NL squad, chose Marquis to be on the NL All Star team, the fifth Rockies pitcher to be an All Star. &quot;This is something ... I&#x27;ll cherish the rest of my life,&quot; said Marquis. The next day Marquis followed up his shutout of the Dodgers with 8 shutout innings in a 1–0 victory over the Nationals, for a major-league-leading 11th win. He became the third pitcher in club history to win 11 games before the All Star break, the team record, joining Shawn Chacón (2003) and Aaron Cook (2008). At the 2009 All Star Game, Marquis (a former Cardinal) received one of the biggest ovations during pregame introductions of any non-Cardinal player, and then warmed up in the ninth inning but never did enter the game.

On August 19, Marquis joined Adam Wainwright as the only 14-game winners in the NL, and tied for the major league lead.

In 2009, Marquis was 2nd in the NL in ground ball outs induced (353) and ground balls induced (408), tied for second in double plays induced (28), 3rd in ground ball percentage (55.6%), 3rd-lowest in pitches per plate appearance (3.53), tied for 4th in wins (15), 8th in innings pitched (216.0) and home runs per 9 innings pitched (.625), 4th-lowest in pitches per inning (15.0; of NL pitchers with 160 or more innings), and tied for 6th in shutouts (1). At the plate, Marquis tied for 3rd in the major leagues among pitchers in runs scored (7), and tied for 6th in doubles (3) and RBIs (8).

Marquis is one of only six major league pitchers who won at least 11 games in each year from 2004 to 2009, the others being CC Sabathia, Derek Lowe, Johan Santana, Javier Vázquez, and John Lackey. He never started fewer than 29 games during that span.

When the Rockies qualified for the postseason in 2009, it marked the 10th time in 10 years (every year of his major league career) that the team for which he pitched made the playoffs. He became the first player in baseball history to have been on a playoff team in each of the first 10 years of his career while playing for at least three different teams.

After the 2009 season Marquis became a free agent. The Rockies offered him arbitration, but he rejected their offer of a one-year, non-guaranteed deal for the possibility that he would receive a multi-year deal.

===Washington Nationals (2010–11)===

On December 22, 2009, Marquis signed a two-year, $15 million contract with the Washington Nationals for the 2010 and 2011 seasons.

Marquis had 3 starts early in the 2010 season for the Nationals, posting an 0–3 record with a 20.52 ERA before being placed on the 15-day DL on April 22, 2010, with bone chips in his right elbow. He returned to action on August 8, 2010. He was much improved upon returning from his injury, but still finished the season a disappointing 2–9 with a 6.60 ERA.

Marquis started 20 games for the Nationals in 2011, going 8–5 with a 3.95 ERA.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2011)===
On July 30, 2011, Marquis was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league infielder Zach Walters.
On August 14, during his third start for Arizona, Marquis had his fibula broken by a comebacker and was out for the remainder of the season.

===Minnesota Twins (2012)===
Marquis signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Minnesota Twins on December 22, 2011.

He was designated for assignment in May, after posting an 8.47 ERA in his seven starts.
On May 26, 2012, Marquis was released, allowing him to sign with any team.

===San Diego Padres (2012–13)===
Marquis signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on May 29, 2012, and was assigned to their Double-A affiliate in San Antonio. After one minor league start, he was promoted to the major league club and made his first start as a Padre on June 7 at home against the San Francisco Giants. Marquis recorded his 1,000th career major league strikeout on June 18 against Ian Kinsler of the Texas Rangers in the second inning of an interleague game at Petco Park. The highlight game of Marquis&#x27; season was a two-hit shutout pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 11. Marquis took a no-hitter into the 7th inning before it was broken up by a Travis Snider infield single.

On August 21, Marquis took a comebacker off the heel of his glove hand, breaking his wrist. Although Marquis continued to pitch in the game, the broken wrist ended his 2012 season. Marquis finished with a 6–7 record and 4.04 ERA in 15 starts for the Padres, with 79 strikeouts and 29 walks. Marquis also upheld his reputation as a good hitter in 2012, collecting nine hits, including three doubles, in 32 at-bats.

The Padres re-signed Marquis in the off-season to a one-year, $3 million contract. He opened the season as the fourth starter in the rotation.

Marquis started the 2013 season with a 9–5 record, including winning eight straight decisions from April 28 to June 15. In July he suffered a complete tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and had Tommy John surgery, which ended his season. He finished with a 4.05 ERA and 72 strikeouts in his 20 starts, but was leading the league with 68 walks at the time of his injury.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On June 3, 2014, Marquis signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was released from his contract after coming off the disabled list in late August.

===Cincinnati Reds (2015)===
On January 21, 2015, he signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. In March 2015, Reds manager Bryan Price announced Marquis would be in the Reds&#x27; pitching rotation. In May 2015, Marquis batted eighth in the lineup, the first Reds pitcher to bat higher than ninth since pitcher Red Lucas batted seventh for the Reds on September 7, 1933.

He was 3–4 with a 6.46 ERA in nine starts. He was designated for assignment on June 5, 2015.

==Team Israel==
When there was talk in the off-season about an Israeli team being fielded in the World Baseball Classic, Marquis said if it came about he would definitely be interested in playing to represent his heritage. In September 2012, Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier due to being active on a major league team. Israel was unable to qualify for the tournament, making it so Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel.

Marquis pitched in the qualifying round for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier. During the opening game of the qualifiers Marquis started and threw 41 pitches over three innings, while giving up two hits and one earned run, while recording a strikeout and a walk. Under World Baseball Classic rules any pitcher who throws over 50 pitches cannot pitch again for four days, therefore by pulling Marquis before reaching this limit, enabled Israel to utilize Marquis again in the tournament. Marquis again started for the final game of the qualifier and threw 43 pitches over four perfect innings, while recording 5 strikeouts. Following his four perfect innings, Marquis said: &quot;I try to approach every opportunity I get with as much passion as I can, it was definitely our goal to win this qualifier and get to the main event.&quot;

Marquis once again pitched for Israel at the World Baseball Classic, during the main tournament in March 2017. He started three of the team&#x27;s first four games in the WBC, all of which the team won. He went 1–0 with an 0.93 ERA and gave up only one run in innings to world #3 South Korea, world #5 Cuba, and world #9 the Netherlands.

==Playing style==

===Pitching===
Marquis relied mostly on his sinker. He threw it harder than most pitchers, got plenty of movement on the pitch, and threw it down in the strike zone as he tried to induce hitters to hit ground balls. He also relied heavily on a sharp slider. In his career with Atlanta, the Braves system steered Marquis to also throw a four-seam fastball in the mid- to high-90s, but in St. Louis he began to gravitate toward instead using a sinking two-seam fastball that he had thrown as a teenager, which he still threw in the mid-90s. In addition, he throws an excellent occasional overhand tight curve ball, and a changeup which has good action.

Marquis, the 144th Jewish player in major league history, is sixth all-time in strikeouts among Jewish major league pitchers and seventh in wins, trailing among others Sandy Koufax, Ken Holtzman, and Steve Stone in both categories. In 2009, he became the second Jewish pitcher to notch at least ten victories in six consecutive seasons, joining Koufax.

===Hitting and baserunning===
Marquis was an excellent hitter for his position. Though not unheard of for pitchers, Marquis was sometimes called upon to pinch hit, something that is extraordinarily rare for a modern-day pitcher. He constantly hit off the tee in batting cages. His baserunning speed has also led to him being used as a pinch-runner. &quot;Watch Marquis take batting practice,&quot; wrote John Schlegel for &quot;MLB.com&quot;, &quot;and you think you&#x27;re watching a left-handed slugger. He can ping baseballs off the bleachers with the best of them. Watch him run up the first-base line with the speed of an outfielder and the intensity of a linebacker, and you can&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s a pitcher.&quot;

In 2005, he achieved two career-highs: a .310 batting average, and a .460 slugging percentage. In 87 at-bats he had 27 hits, including nine doubles, a triple, and a home run as he both scored 10 runs and drove in 10 runs. He was the first pitcher to bat over .300 since Mike Hampton batted .344 in 2002 (minimum of 50 at-bats). His 27 hits were the most by a big-league pitcher since Rick Rhoden had 28 in 1984, and 24 came as a pitcher and three as pinch-hitter. For his hitting, Marquis won the 2005 NL Pitcher Silver Slugger Award.

His first three home runs were hit off Wandy Rodríguez, Brian Lawrence, and Javier Vázquez. In 2008, he hit a career-high two homers as he again drove in 10 runs, this time in 59 at-bats. He belted his fourth home run on September 6, against Cincinnati&#x27;s Gary Majewski at the Great American Ballpark. On September 22, he hit his first career grand slam, off New York Mets rookie Jon Niese at Shea Stadium. That night he was also credited with five RBIs — four of which came with his grand slam — in a career-high performance. It was the first grand slam by a Jewish pitcher since Saul Rogovin of the Detroit Tigers hit one in 1950 off Eddie Lopat of the Yankees.

In 441 at-bats through 2008, Marquis had a .206 career batting average, with 25 doubles, two triples, five home runs, 50 runs scored, 40 RBIs, 23 sacrifice hits, and a .306 slugging percentage — 9th-best of all pitchers with at least 100 at-bats. He had a .276 career batting average in 59 plate appearances with two outs and runners in scoring position. With the bases loaded, through August 2008 he was a career .364 batter, with a .500 on-base percentage and an .818 slugging percentage. In 26 at-bats as a pinch hitter, he had a .231 batting average. Summarizing his approach to hitting, Marquis said: &quot;I&#x27;m not going up as a pitcher with a bat. I&#x27;m going up as a hitter.&quot;

Marquis, on retiring after the 2015 season, posted a .196 batting average (130-for-663) with 66 runs, 35 doubles, two triples, five home runs, 57 RBI and 13 bases on balls.

===Fielding===
Marquis exhibited a better range factor at pitcher than the league average every year of his career, through 2009. He recorded a career .955 fielding percentage.

==Family==
Marquis and his wife, Debbie (née Masseria), have three children. They currently reside in the Tottenville section of his native Staten Island, New York.

<text>Colour of right, sometimes referred to as a claim of right, is the legal concept in common law countries of an accused&#x27;s permission to the usage or conversion of an asset in the possession of another. The concept can also refer to a right, authority or power conferred on an official by way of a relationship between various statutory or regulatory instruments, where the official is granted a position&#x27;s powers without having to actually occupy the position.

In New Zealand&#x27;s Crimes Act, colour of right &quot;means an honest belief that an act is justifiable...&quot;. Using this as a defence does not automatically guarantee an acquittal; however, it does diminish the mens rea component needed for a conviction. Notably, the legal requirements proving colour of right differ in New Zealand than in other common law countries as a result of &quot;Hayes v R&quot;.

Examples:

Bram&#x27;s friend lets him use his van to go to a party later that night. Neither Bram nor the van return the next day. Bram comes back five days later after using the van to go on a camping trip. Bram goes to court for theft. He argues that he thought that he had the right to use the van for the camping trip because he was allowed to use the van to go the party.

Susan’s car is stolen from her driveway. Some days later, Susan sees an advertisement for someone selling her exact car which had been stolen. She approaches the seller by deceptively acting as an interested buyer. Susan then asks for a test drive and proceeds to drive away with the car, not returning nor paying the seller for the car on the grounds that she is the rightful owner.

<doc id="1109958" wikidata="Q6675770" url="?curid=1109958" title="Loop-erased random walk">
<text>In mathematics, loop-erased random walk is a model for a random simple path with important applications in combinatorics, physics and quantum field theory. It is intimately connected to the uniform spanning tree, a model for a random tree. See also &quot;random walk&quot; for more general treatment of this topic.

==Definition==
Assume &quot;G&quot; is some graph and formula_1 is some path of length &quot;n&quot; on &quot;G&quot;. In other words, formula_2 are vertices of &quot;G&quot; such that formula_3 and formula_4 are connected by an edge. Then the loop erasure of formula_1 is a new simple path created by erasing all the loops of formula_1 in chronological order. Formally, we define indices formula_7 inductively using

:formula_8
:formula_9

where &quot;max&quot; here means up to the length of the path formula_1. The induction stops when for some formula_7 we have formula_12. 

In words, to find formula_13, we hold formula_14 in one hand, and with the other hand, we trace back from the end: formula_15, until we either hit some formula_16, in which case we set formula_17, or we end up at formula_14, in which case we set formula_19.

Assume the induction stops at &quot;J&quot; i.e. formula_20 is the last formula_21. Then the loop erasure of formula_1, denoted by formula_23 is a simple path of length &quot;J&quot; defined by

:formula_24

Now let &quot;G&quot; be some graph, let &quot;v&quot; be a vertex of &quot;G&quot;, and let &quot;R&quot; be a random walk on &quot;G&quot; starting from &quot;v&quot;. Let &quot;T&quot; be some stopping time for &quot;R&quot;. Then the loop-erased random walk until time &quot;T&quot; is LE(&quot;R&quot;([1,&quot;T&quot;])). In other words, take &quot;R&quot; from its beginning until &quot;T&quot; — that&#x27;s a (random) path — erase all the loops in chronological order as above — you get a random simple path.

The stopping time &quot;T&quot; may be fixed, i.e. one may perform &quot;n&quot; steps and then loop-erase. However, it is usually more natural to take &quot;T&quot; to be the hitting time in some set. For example, let &quot;G&quot; be the graph Z2 and let &quot;R&quot; be a random walk starting from the point (0,0). Let &quot;T&quot; be the time when &quot;R&quot; first hits the circle of radius 100 (we mean here of course a &quot;discretized&quot; circle). LE(&quot;R&quot;) is called the loop-erased random walk starting at (0,0) and stopped at the circle.

==Uniform spanning tree==
For any graph &quot;G&quot;, a spanning tree of &quot;G&quot; is a subgraph of &quot;G&quot; containing all vertices and some of the edges, which is a tree, i.e. connected and with no cycles. A spanning tree chosen randomly from among all possible spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree. There are typically exponentially many spanning trees (too many to generate them all and then choose one randomly); instead, uniform spanning trees can be generated more efficiently by an algorithm called Wilson&#x27;s algorithm which uses loop-erased random walks.

The algorithm proceeds according to the following steps. First, construct a single-vertex tree &quot;T&quot; by choosing (arbitrarily) one vertex. Then, while the tree &quot;T&quot; constructed so far does not yet include all of the vertices of the graph, let &quot;v&quot; be an arbitrary vertex that is not in &quot;T&quot;, perform a loop-erased random walk from &quot;v&quot; until reaching a vertex in &quot;T&quot;, and add the resulting path to &quot;T&quot;. Repeating this process until all vertices are included produces a uniformly distributed tree, regardless of the arbitrary choices of vertices at each step.

A connection in the other direction is also true. If &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are two vertices in &quot;G&quot; then, in any spanning tree, they are connected by a unique path. Taking this path in the &quot;uniform&quot; spanning tree gives a random simple path. It turns out that the distribution of this path is identical to the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at &quot;v&quot; and stopped at &quot;w&quot;. This fact can be used to justify the correctness of Wilson&#x27;s algorithm. Another corollary is that loop-erased random walk is symmetric in its start and end points. More precisely, the distribution of the loop-erased random walk starting at &quot;v&quot; and stopped at &quot;w&quot; is identical to the distribution of the reversal of loop-erased random walk starting at &quot;w&quot; and stopped at &quot;v&quot;. Loop-erasing a random walk and the reverse walk do not, in general, give the same result, but according to this result the distributions of the two loop-erased walks are identical.

==The Laplacian random walk==
Another representation of loop-erased random walk stems from solutions of the discrete Laplace equation. Let &quot;G&quot; again be a graph and let &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; be two vertices in &quot;G&quot;. Construct a random path from &quot;v&quot; to &quot;w&quot; inductively using the following procedure. Assume we have already defined formula_25. Let &quot;f&quot; be a function from &quot;G&quot; to R satisfying

:formula_26 for all formula_27 and formula_28
:&quot;f&quot; is discretely harmonic everywhere else

Where a function &quot;f&quot; on a graph is discretely harmonic at a point &quot;x&quot; if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) equals the average of &quot;f&quot; on the neighbors of &quot;x&quot;.

With &quot;f&quot; defined choose formula_29 using &quot;f&quot; at the neighbors of formula_30 as weights. In other words, if formula_31 are these neighbors, choose formula_32 with probability

:formula_33

Continuing this process, recalculating &quot;f&quot; at each step, will result in a random simple path from &quot;v&quot; to &quot;w&quot;; the distribution of this path is identical to that of a loop-erased random walk from &quot;v&quot; to &quot;w&quot;. 

An alternative view is that the distribution of a loop-erased random walk conditioned to start in some path β is identical to the loop-erasure of a random walk conditioned not to hit β. This property is often referred to as the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (though the relation to the usual Markov property is somewhat vague).

It is important to notice that while the proof of the equivalence is quite easy, models which involve dynamically changing harmonic functions or measures are typically extremely difficult to analyze. Practically nothing is known about the p-Laplacian walk or diffusion-limited aggregation. Another somewhat related model is the harmonic explorer.

Finally there is another link that should be mentioned: Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem relates the number of spanning trees of a graph &quot;G&quot; to the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian. See spanning tree for details.

==Grids==
Let &quot;d&quot; be the dimension, which we will assume to be at least 2. Examine Z&quot;d&quot; i.e. all the points formula_34 with integer formula_35. This is an infinite graph with degree 2&quot;d&quot; when you connect each point to its nearest neighbors. From now on we will consider loop-erased random walk on this graph or its subgraphs.

===High dimensions===
The easiest case to analyze is dimension 5 and above. In this case it turns out that there the intersections are only local. A calculation shows that if one takes a random walk of length &quot;n&quot;, its loop-erasure has length of the same order of magnitude, i.e. &quot;n&quot;. Scaling accordingly, it turns out that loop-erased random walk converges (in an appropriate sense) to Brownian motion as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity. Dimension 4 is more complicated, but the general picture is still true. It turns out that the loop-erasure of a random walk of length &quot;n&quot; has approximately formula_36 vertices, but again, after scaling (that takes into account the logarithmic factor) the loop-erased walk converges to Brownian motion.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, arguments from conformal field theory and simulation results led to a number of exciting conjectures. Assume &quot;D&quot; is some simply connected domain in the plane and &quot;x&quot; is a point in &quot;D&quot;. Take the graph &quot;G&quot; to be

:formula_37

that is, a grid of side length ε restricted to &quot;D&quot;. Let &quot;v&quot; be the vertex of &quot;G&quot; closest to &quot;x&quot;. Examine now a loop-erased random walk starting from &quot;v&quot; and stopped when hitting the &quot;boundary&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, i.e. the vertices of &quot;G&quot; which correspond to the boundary of &quot;D&quot;. Then the conjectures are
* As ε goes to zero the distribution of the path converges to some distribution on simple paths from &quot;x&quot; to the boundary of &quot;D&quot; (different from Brownian motion, of course — in 2 dimensions paths of Brownian motion are not simple). This distribution (denote it by formula_38) is called the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk.
* These distributions are conformally invariant. Namely, if φ is a Riemann map between &quot;D&quot; and a second domain &quot;E&quot; then

:formula_39

*The Hausdorff dimension of these paths is 5/4 almost surely.

The first attack at these conjectures came from the direction of domino tilings. Taking a spanning tree of &quot;G&quot; and adding to it its planar dual one gets a domino tiling of a special derived graph (call it &quot;H&quot;). Each vertex of &quot;H&quot; corresponds to a vertex, edge or face of &quot;G&quot;, and the edges of &quot;H&quot; show which vertex lies on which edge and which edge on which face. It turns out that taking a uniform spanning tree of &quot;G&quot; leads to a uniformly distributed random domino tiling of &quot;H&quot;. The number of domino tilings of a graph can be calculated using the determinant of special matrices, which allow to connect it to the discrete Green function which is approximately conformally invariant. These arguments allowed to show that certain measurables of loop-erased random walk are (in the limit) conformally invariant, and that the expected number of vertices in a loop-erased random walk stopped at a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; is of the order of formula_40.

In 2002 these conjectures were resolved (positively) using Stochastic Löwner Evolution. Very roughly, it is a stochastic conformally invariant ordinary differential equation which allows to catch the Markov property of loop-erased random walk (and many other probabilistic processes).

===Three dimensions===
The scaling limit exists and is invariant under rotations and dilations. If formula_41 denotes the expected number of vertices in the loop-erased random walk until it gets to a distance of &quot;r&quot;, then

:formula_42

where ε, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are some positive numbers (the numbers can, in principle, be calculated from the proofs, but the author did not do it). This suggests that the scaling limit should have Hausdorff dimension between formula_43 and 5/3 almost surely. Numerical experiments show that it should be formula_44.

<text>Efraín Morote Best (8 July 1921 7 April 1989) was a Peruvian lawyer, anthropologist, and academic administrator. From 1962 to 1968 he served as the Rector (i.e., chief administrator) of San Cristóbal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, Perú. He and three of his children became members of Shining Path.

==Biography==
Morote was born in Ayacucho into a wealthy and established family that owned land in Ayacucho, Abancay, and Cuzco, in southern Perú. During the 1940s and 1950s, he studied at various Peruvian universities and obtained degrees in literature, history, and law. Morote then became a specialist in the folklore of the Quechua-speaking native population of the Peruvian Andes and taught at the University of Cuzco. When the Peruvian government decided to reopen an old Catholic seminary in Ayacucho and make it into a modern university dedicated to improving the condition of the region&#x27;s impoverished native population, Morote joined the new institution as professor of anthropology and vice-rector. The university began to operate in 1959. In 1962, Morote was chosen to succeed naval historian Fernando Romero Pintado as the university&#x27;s leader.

Following a pattern which was not uncommon among Latin American intellectuals from upper and upper-middle-class backgrounds at the time, Morote embraced first religion (becoming the pastor of an evangelical Christian church) and later Communism. At the beginning of his tenure as rector, Morote recruited Abimael Guzmán as a professor of philosophy at the university. Guzmán went on to become the leader of a terrorist group, the Shining Path, which sought to bring about a pro-Communist uprising in Perú modeled after Mao Zedong&#x27;s revolution in China. The Shining Path waged a 13-year-long conflict with both the Peruvian government and rival leftist militants. Osmán Morote Barrionuevo, one of Efraín Morote&#x27;s sons, became the Shining Path&#x27;s second-in-command. Efraín Morote&#x27;s other two children also became members of the Shining Path.

Some observers, such as British writer Nicholas Shakespeare (who fictionalized the capture of Abimael Guzmán in his novel &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot;), have argued that Efraín Morote was probably the true intellectual leader of the Shining Path. Shakespeare described Abimael Guzmán as a man &quot;absolutely without character&quot; while he claimed that Morote was &quot;incredibly intelligent and without emotion,&quot; a truly &quot;evil&quot; man.

Publicly, Morote remained until his death a respected social scientist of leftist political leanings.

<doc id="1109974" wikidata="Q7832134" url="?curid=1109974" title="Trademark attorney">
<text>A trademark attorney (U.S. spelling) or trade mark attorney or agent (UK spelling) is a person who is qualified to act in matters involving trademark law and practice and provide legal advice on trade mark and design matters.

In many countries, most notably the United Kingdom, trade mark attorneys are a separate recognized legal profession, along with solicitors and barristers, and are recognized as lawyers under the Legal Services Act 2007. In other jurisdictions, such as the United States, the profession is less clearly defined, with trademark attorneys being part of the general legal profession. In other words, they are attorneys at law who specialize in trade mark matters. In many countries, trademark attorneys have rights of audience before intellectual property courts, and benefit from attorney–client privilege. Unless they are also members of the general legal profession, as they are in the United States, their right to appear in Court is usually limited to trademark matters.

A trademark attorney frequently begins his or her career by joining a firm of trademark attorneys, or a firm of Intellectual Property attorneys with departments specializing in patent law, trademark law, and copyright law. Increasingly however, large multi-discipline law firms are establishing trademark practices. Trademark attorneys are also employed by large companies which have enough trademark interests to need an attorney just to deal with their own matters.

The responsibilities of a trademark attorney include advising on the adoption and selection of new trademarks; filing and prosecuting applications to register trademarks; advising on the use and registration of trademarks; handling trademark oppositions, revocations, invalidations and assignments; carry out searches; and advising on trademark infringement matters.

Trademark attorneys are often regulated as a profession, in which case they must pass a series of examinations, comply with other requirements, and observe professional ethics and standards in order to maintain formal registration (under the &quot;Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&quot; and &quot;Trade Marks Act 1994&quot; in the UK, for instance).

This is typically the position in Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where only qualified individuals may hold themselves out as being trade mark attorneys. In such cases the qualification is known as an &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;protected&quot; title. The minimum educational requirements to enter the profession in such cases are GCSE A, B or C grade in five approved subjects, and GCE &#x27;A&#x27; level in two approved subjects, or their equivalents. Candidates with certain degrees, such as law, may be eligible for exemption in some Foundation Papers of the qualifying examination (and will usually find it easier to find a job as a trainee).

There is no exclusive title in other jurisdictions such as the United States, where no specialized examinations are required in order to qualify and practice as a trademark attorney. In the United States, any attorney who is licensed to practice law in any state can represent individuals and companies in trademark matters before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This stems from the view that an attorney is capable of practicing law in any field with a minimum level of competence as shown by passing a state bar exam.

In the United States, any attorney who is licensed to practice law in any state can represent individuals and companies in the United States Trademark Office. Many trademark attorneys have undergraduate degrees in a variety of fields such as business administration, marketing, liberal arts rather than in the science or engineering field which a Patent Attorney must have in order to practice in the United States Patent Office. Furthermore, a patent attorney must pass a special exam in order to represent individuals and companies in the Patent Office while a trademark attorney does not. 
In addition, the examiners who review all trademark applications filed with the Trademark Office are also licensed attorneys and their official title is Trademark Examining Attorney. They also do a trademark search of the federal trademark records to determine if the trademark applied for is confusingly similar to a registered or a prior pending application.

<doc id="1109983" wikidata="Q6698200" url="?curid=1109983" title="Lucy Benjamin">
<text>Lucy Benjamin (born Lucy Jane Baker; 25 June 1970) is an English actress. After appearing in various television series including &quot;Close to Home&quot; (1989–1990), &quot;Press Gang&quot; (1989–1993) and &quot;Jupiter Moon&quot; (1990, 1996), she was cast in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Lisa Fowler in 1998, for which she received a nomination for Most Popular Actress at the 2001 National Television Awards.

Following her initial departure from the soap in 2003, she competed in &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; (2006) which she won, as well as competing in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; (2009). She made guest returns to &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2010 and 2017, while also appearing in series such as &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;. From 2019 to 2020, she reprised her role as Lisa on &quot;EastEnders&quot; for four months, before returning for another short stint in 2023.

==Early life==
Benjamin was born on 25 June 1970 in Reading, Berkshire as Lucy Jane Baker. While attending school in Sandhurst, she performed in school concerts; her parents were informed by one of her primary school teachers that she had drama talent and advised them to let her attend a nearby theatre school. She began attending Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead, and began dance lessons at the age of nine. She took the stage surname of Benjamin from her brother.

==Career==
Benjamin&#x27;s first acting role was as a child actress in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1983, playing a younger version of the character Nyssa in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;. In 1989, she starred in the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Press Gang&quot;, where she played Julie Craig. From 1989 to 1990, Benjamin appeared in two series of LWT sitcom &quot;Close to Home&quot;, playing Paul Nicholas&#x27; teenage daughter Kate Shepherd. Also in 1990, Benjamin appeared in the British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) Galaxy Channel soap opera &quot;Jupiter Moon&quot;. In 1995, she appeared in the Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall comedy &quot;Bottom&quot;.

From 1998 to 2003, she played Lisa Fowler in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. During her time on the programme, Benjamin was involved in one of the soap&#x27;s most viewed storylines, known as &quot;Who Shot Phil?&quot; (2001). The storyline centered on the shooting of her on-screen lover Phil Mitchell, and who, out of the many potential candidates, was responsible. Her character was eventually revealed to be the shooter. She was asked back for a short period in 2003, to help with the forthcoming exit of Steve McFadden, who was taking a hiatus from the programme. After leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Benjamin appeared in the BBC television programme &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot; and the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;. She has also appeared in pantomimes across London, as well as touring for six months in the play &quot;Framed&quot;. In April 2006, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Benjamin was in talks with &quot;EastEnders&quot; about reprising the role of Lisa Fowler. Benjamin stated in an interview that all rumours of her returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot; were inaccurate.

In June 2006, Benjamin appeared on &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;, which she won. She was mentored by judge Louis Walsh. She also appeared as Heather in Stephen Fry&#x27;s drama &quot;Kingdom&quot;. In October 2006, Benjamin appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;. In September 2008, she appeared in &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;, winning £10,000 for her charity Rosie&#x27;s Rainbow Fund. Benjamin then starred in &quot;The Pretender Agenda&quot; at the New Players Theatre with Lee Ryan, as well as starring in the horror film &quot;Not Alone&quot;. In 2009, she was a contestant in the ITV1 series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; In August 2010, Benjamin returned to &quot;EastEnders&quot; for one episode in a storyline that was building up to the exit of Barbara Windsor.

In 2013, Benjamin starred as Velma Von Tussle in the UK tour of the West End stage show &quot;Hairspray&quot;. Between April and July 2017, Benjamin had a recurring role as Denise Ellisson in &quot;Casualty&quot;. Benjamin reprised her role as Lisa for a short stint in July 2017, part of on-screen daughter Louise Mitchell&#x27;s (Tilly Keeper) bullying storyline.

In 2014 Benjamin presented the role of Maggie in the comedy series &quot;Detectorists&quot;.

On 27 May 2019, it was announced that Benjamin would be returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot; on a permanent basis. She returned on 2 September 2019, and departed in January 2020 alongside Keeper. In May 2021, she starred in another episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; as Jan Fisher. For her appearance in &quot;Doctors&quot;, she won the award for Acting Performance at the RTS Midlands Awards. The win marked her first award in her career. In 2022, she reprised her role of Jan in &quot;Doctors&quot;.

==Personal life==
Benjamin married Richard Taggart, an oil businessman, at Babington House, Somerset on 30 March 2006. The couple met during a flight to Dubai and became engaged three months later. Benjamin and Taggart now live in Gidea Park, Greater London.

In the first episode of &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; on 31 May 2006, Sharon Osbourne accidentally revealed that Benjamin was pregnant. Benjamin smiled while host Kate Thornton commented: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you wanted that announced tonight, did you?&quot; Benjamin gave birth by caesarean section to a daughter at Harold Wood Hospital in London on 22 November 2006. On 19 October 2010, she revealed that she was three months pregnant with her second child. In April 2011, she gave birth to a second daughter.

In May 2015, she claimed £326,000 for infringement of her privacy rights, although substantial she was awarded less than half that sum, £157,250 by Mr Justice Mann as part of an overall £1.2 million celebrity payout relating to the phone hacking scandal carried out by Mirror Group newspapers (&quot;Trinity Mirror&quot;), under her married name, Lucy Taggart.

<doc id="1109987" wikidata="Q4824312" url="?curid=1109987" title="Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers">
<text>The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers (AIMPE) is both an Australian professional association and a trade union. They are registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and are affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
The AIMPE represents engineers in coastal shipping, the offshore oil and gas industries, towing and dredging.

They cover, in the maritime industry, employed and unemployed marine engineers, engineers or electricians on ships, people in training to be a marine engineer, officers of AIMPE, (when holding appropriate certification) power plant engineers, and (when holding appropriate certification) Charge Engineers and Assistant Charge Engineers employed in New South Wales by Caltex Refining. AIMPE also cover independent contractors who meet the criteria listed. According to the AIMPE&#x27;s rules, the maritime industry is an operation on any sea going vessel. It excludes shore based operations in the maritime industry outside of shore based training.

Their membership is extremely expensive for an Australian trade union (&gt;$1500 per annum, compared with $337 for the TWU for example).

The AIMPE is very concerned with the use of flags of convenience by employers as a way of avoiding occupational health and safety conditions and employment conditions.

Even with the demise of the Australian maritime industry, there are now more members registered with the Institute than at any other time. This being due to the offshore industry requiring rigorously trained and certified engineering staff.

Their federal president is Martin Byrne.

==History==

The AIMPE official website recognises the conflict of interest it has, that marine engineers have, &quot;endeavoured to find a commonality of interest with their employers&quot; in &quot;a world where capitalist efficiency could lead to excesses against which workers felt it necessary to protect themselves by combining for fair wages and conditions.&quot; The AIMPE has historically been divided between a professional organisation supporting the bosses (much like APESMA), while also having the anti-boss &quot;Not for one but for all&quot; mentality of a trade union.

The AIMPE began as a craft union, using a monopoly on skill to bargain with employers. The general increase in the level of skill over the 20th century has broken this skill monopoly.

<doc id="1109995" wikidata="Q5428530" url="?curid=1109995" title="Facets (album)">
<text>Facets is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Jim Croce, released and self-published in 1966. Croce had five hundred copies of the album pressed, financed with a $500 cash wedding gift that he and his wife to be, Ingrid Croce, received from his parents. Croce&#x27;s parents were certain that Jim would fail completely at selling the record, and realizing that he couldn&#x27;t support his family as a singer, would abandon music and finish his college education. The album was recorded in a three-hour session at Ken-Del Studios in Wilmington, Delaware. Unexpectedly, it proved to be a success. Croce sold every record, even turning a profit of $2,500. The majority of those records were sold to fans who attended Croce&#x27;s shows at local bars. Original vinyl copies of &quot;Facets&quot; are extremely rare today. 

Shout! Factory released an expanded CD version in 2004. These seven extra songs included in the CD were recorded in 1969 after recording the &quot;Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce&quot; album in 1968. The couple recorded 21 songs as a demonstration tape to audition for a Boston&#x27;s children TV show. They did not get the job. The demo tapes had never been released until seven tracks were selected to be included with the 2004 CD release.
