<text>The Big Five () was the name given to a group of what started as sugarcane processing corporations that wielded considerable political power in the Territory of Hawaii during the early 20th century, and leaned heavily toward the Hawaii Republican Party. The Big Five were Castle &amp; Cooke, Alexander &amp; Baldwin, C. Brewer &amp; Co., Theo H. Davies &amp; Co., and American Factors (now Amfac). The term &quot;Big Five&quot; is often used in both association to the largest five corporations and the five missionary families from which these companies hailed. These missionary families were the first generation of missionaries to settle in Hawaii. While not all of the Big Five corporations were started by missionary families, by 1920, the second generation of missionary descendants controlled all five companies. The extent of the power that the Big Five had was considered by some as equivalent to an oligarchy. Attorney General of Hawaii Edmund Pearson Dole, referring to the Big Five, said in 1903: &quot;There is a government in this Territory which is centralized to an extent unknown in the United States, and probably almost as centralized as it was in France under Louis XIV.&quot;

==History==
Though commercial sugar production began in the first years of the 1800s, the industry remained relatively minor until the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. This treaty provided duty-free trade of sugar between the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States, and it generated massive disruptions in the sugar industry. Plantation growth and consolidation soon followed, with the number of plantations falling from 79 in 1875 to just 20 in 1883. Prior to this disruption, the agencies played a much more limited role in Hawaiian industry. They served primarily to add liquidity to an agricultural industry with long growing periods (18–24 months) by both providing credit against future sales and providing transportation to foreign markets and equipment procurement. With the growth pressure imposed by the Reciprocity Treaty, however, plantations required capital infusions in order to expand their cultivation into more marginal lands, leading to increased reliance on the agencies for credit. In 1889, C. Brewer &amp; Co., H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. (Amfac), Castle &amp; Cooke, and Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co., which were the original four predecessors of the Big Five, controlled 56% of sugar crops in Hawaii. The political stance of the five firms varied from pro-monarchy to revolutionary. However, some of the children of Big Five partners were involved in the Committee of Safety, which organized the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and lobbied for annexation. With Hawaii&#x27;s annexation by the United States, this change was locked in as sugarcane plantations gained a new infusion of investment. By eliminating tariffs imposed on sugarcane producers by the United States, planters had more money to spend on equipment, land and labor. Increased capital resulted in increased production. Five kingdom-era corporations benefited from annexation, becoming multimillion-dollar conglomerations that controlled 90% of the sugar business.

The Big Five were involved in other businesses outside of plantations through direct ownership or by acting as directors, most notably shipping companies, utilities, railroads, and banks. Each of these corporations maintained networks of stockholdings, landholdings, and cooperative arrangements among the managers and owners of plantations and other industries. These corporations held significant power over the islands through their control and investments in land, water, and forest resources. The scope of power they held led to many residents considering them a capitalist oligarchy. By the 1910s, the third generation of missionary sons and sons-in-law in succession to the Big Five obtained the command of the corporations. However, by the 1920s, due to World War I, a majority of the sugar assets were controlled by Castle &amp; Cooke, C. Brewer &amp; Co., and Alexander &amp; Baldwin. The companies colluded to keep the prices on their goods and services high. Their profits skyrocketed even more. Soon, the executives of the Big Five sat on each other&#x27;s boards of directors. With economic power came political power, and the families usually favored the Republican Party of Hawaii. Political power over the islands was exerted by controlling most sugar and pineapple plantations, utilities, transportation and construction companies, insurance firms, and banks. Furthermore, appointed territorial governors and ministers similarly had connections to the Big Five as officers within the firms or investors.

Residents of Hawaii understood the vast influence of the Big Five. It was during the labor-organizing period that the term “Big Five” likely grew in usage amongst people critiquing the social workings of Hawaii.  These companies eventually became the objects of protest. In September 1949, a Labor Day parade in Maui included a sign that read “CONGRESS—INVESTIGATE THE BIG FIVE.&quot; During the Democratic Revolution of 1954, the unions inflicted a decisive blow against the giants, and when the sugar industry declined after Hawaii became a state in 1959, so did each of the Big Five companies. The greatest post-statehood challenge came as the US Department of Justice challenged the ownership of Matson Navigation Company by four of the five companies (all except Theo H. Davies). The lawsuit was settled when the four companies agreed not to share officers, executives, and directors. Alexander and Baldwin eventually bought out the other three stakes in Matson in 1964.

In the 1970s, as sugar plantations closed, many of the Big Five companies themselves were bought out. Where the companies are now:
* Theo H. Davies &amp; Co. was bought in 1973 by Scottish-controlled Hong Kong firm Jardine Matheson. Until December 2004 it owned the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchises in Hawaii. The sole remaining unit is its travel agency which was spun off and sold to management.
* C. Brewer was bought in 1978 by Philadelphia-based IU International Corporation, and was later bought out by its management in 1986. The company owned Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation from 1974 to 2000. In 2001, the company&#x27;s shareholders voted to liquidate the company over several years.
* Castle &amp; Cooke merged with Flexi-Van Corporation, owned by David H. Murdock, in 1985. Murdock became its chairman after the merger, then took full control in 2000. It still owns large portions of Central Oahu and the Iwilei area of Honolulu around the former Dole Food Company pineapple cannery. Castle &amp; Cooke owned nearly all of the island of Lānai until June 2012 when Oracle CEO Larry Ellison bought their share for approximately 500 million dollars.
* Amfac was bought out in 1988 by Chicago-based JMB Realty. In 2002, Amfac declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and emerged as Kaanapali Land, LLC. It owns 5,000 acres (20 km²) in West Maui. Its department store, Liberty House, was sold to Federated Department Stores and is now part of the Macy&#x27;s chain.
* Alexander &amp; Baldwin diversified and remains in business. Today it owns about 91,000 acres (370 km²) of land and is the fifth-largest landowner in the state.

<text>Robert Carman Coates (March 10, 1928 – January 12, 2016) was a Canadian politician and Cabinet minister.

==Early life and education==
Coates was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia, the son of a cattle buyer.

In 1951 Coates received a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Mount Allison University in nearby Sackville, New Brunswick. In 1954, Coates graduated from Dalhousie Law School in Halifax. Prior to his election, Coates was a lawyer and member of the Nova Scotia Barristers&#x27; Society.

==Political career==
Coates was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1957 election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Cumberland, Nova Scotia. Coates was a backbencher during the John Diefenbaker and Joe Clark governments. He was appointed to the Cabinet of Brian Mulroney as Defence Minister following the Tory victory in the 1984 election.

Coates&#x27;s main initiative was the re-introduction of separate uniforms for the naval, land and air branches of the military. Liberal Paul Hellyer had unified the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force into an integrated Canadian Forces with a single uniform in 1967. Hellyer had scrapped the traditional British style uniforms and ranks of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force. The new uniforms resembled those of the US air force.

Coates resigned from the Cabinet on February 12, 1985, after it emerged that he visited several strip clubs during a trip to West Germany in November 1984. Coates did not run in the 1988 election.

==Death==
Coates died in Halifax on January 12, 2016, after a short illness, at the age of 87.

==Personal life==
In 1954, Coates married Mary Blanche Wade of Perth Junction, New Brunswick. The couple had two children, David Wade and Jodi.

There is Robert C. Coates fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="1094553" wikidata="Q4959731" url="?curid=1094553" title="Brean Down Fort">
<text>Brean Down Fort was a Victorian naval fortification designed to protect the Bristol Channel. It was built above sea level on the headland at Brean Down, south of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England.

The site has a long history because of its prominent position. The earliest recorded settlement is from the Early to Middle Bronze Age.

The current buildings were constructed in the 1860s as one of the Palmerston Forts to provide protection to the ports of the Bristol Channel, and was decommissioned in 1901. During World War II it was rearmed and used for experimental weapons testing.

The site has been owned by the National Trust since 2002, following a £431,000 renovation project, as part of its Brean Down property and is open to the public.

The fort was used as a location for filming of the second episode, &quot;Warriors&quot;, of the BBC television drama &quot;Bonekickers&quot;.

The fort was also used for exterior scenes of the Royal Marines attack on the villains base on Cragfest Island in episode six of 1978 HTV series &quot;The Doombolt Chase&quot;.

==Bronze Age to Roman==
The earliest record settlement is from the Early to Middle Bronze Age. It is now on an exposed cliff as the land has been eroded by the sea. Bronze Age artefacts from the site include pottery and jewellery. Most of the finds are now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The presence of a probable roundhouse has also been detected.

The site has also produced Roman gold and silver coins of the emperors Augustus, Nero, Drusus and Vespasian and a cornelian ring.

==Palmerston Fort==
Brean Down Fort forms part of a line of defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. It was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast. Brean Down Fort formed part of a strategic coastal defence system covering the channel between the mainland and the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.

Four acres of land at the end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871.

The fort was originally armed with seven rifled muzzle-loading guns, which were among the last of this type to be made at the Woolwich Gun Foundry. These sited at three main gun positions, including W battery containing two guns on &#x27;C&#x27; pivots (rotating around a reused Georgian cannon set upright in the ground). Each gun weighed 7 tons and had a charge of gunpowder able to fire a Palliser shot at per second. This could pierce of armour at . It was proposed to replace the guns with larger versions in 1888 but this was never put into action. It had a large, underground, main gunpowder magazine, and high. The fort was staffed by 50 officers and men of the Coast Brigade, Royal Artillery, but no shots were ever fired in action.

In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales and Flat Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved his equipment to Brean Down and set a new distance record of for wireless transmission over open sea.
The end of the fort&#x27;s active service came at 5 a.m. on 6 July 1900 when the No. 3 magazine which held 3 tons (3 tonnes) of gunpowder exploded. An inquiry found that Gunner Haines had fired a ball cartridge down a ventilator shaft causing the explosion, after being put on a charge for returning late to barracks, however this explanation has been challenged. The wall separating the fort from the moat on the south west corner was demolished and wreckage thrown up to . No one knew why the gunner had blown up the fort, but it has been speculated that it was an act of suicide. The cannons were hauled away by traction engines.

It was then used as a café, owned by the Hillman family from at least 1907 until sold in 1936 to the &#x27;bird sanctuary people&#x27;.

==World War II==
On the outbreak of World War II the fort was rearmed with two six-inch ex-naval guns and two searchlights as a Coastal artillery battery. The site was also used as a test launch site for rockets and experimental weapons.

Two gun positions were built to mount the ex-naval guns in their turrets. These were later protected with a &quot;plastic&quot; anti-aircraft roof. One position was built over the ruins of the old west battery and the other partly obscures the north west battery. The barrack blocks were converted and the windows partly blocked to reduce the effects of blast. Several other associated structures, including searchlight batteries for illuminating seaborne targets, a command post and the barracks for the garrison were built outside the original Palmeston fort.

The site was manned by 365 and 366 Coast Batteries of 571st Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery, formed from Brean Down Fire Control in December 1941 and disbanded in April 1944.

Several experimental weapons were trialled at Brean, by the Admiralty&#x27;s Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development, based at HMS Birnbeck. The only evidence being a short length of launching rail, designed to launch a bouncing bomb.

Some of the better known weapons trialled were the seaborne Bouncing bomb designed specifically to bounce to a target such as across water to avoid torpedo nets, anti-submarine missile AMUCK and the expendable acoustic emitter (designed to confuse noise-seeking torpedoes).

<doc id="1094556" wikidata="Q747785" url="?curid=1094556" title="Sooty falcon">
<text>The sooty falcon (Falco concolor) is a medium-sized falcon breeding from northeastern Africa to the southern Persian Gulf region. The word sooty means to be covered in soot (ash), and is used to describe the color of the Sooty Falcon. Hence, the falcon gets its name from its color, the color of soot.

==Taxonomy==
The Sooty Falcon is part of the order Falconiformes, family Falconidae and genus &quot;Falco&quot;. The sooty falcon belongs to the hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a subgenus &quot;Hypotriorchis&quot;. Eleonora&#x27;s falcon is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly belong to the same clade, they do not seem to be sister species.

==Description==
This is an elegant bird of prey, 32–37 cm long with a 78–90 cm wingspan. It is shaped like a large hobby or a small Eleonora&#x27;s falcon, with its long pointed wings, long tail and slim body. The adults are blue-grey, and lack the black underwing coverts of the Eleonora&#x27;s falcon. The young bird is like a large juvenile hobby, or small juvenile Eleanora&#x27;s falcon. Its dark trailing edge to the wings and tail distinguish it from the former species, and it lacks the underwing contrast caused by the dark coverts of the larger falcon.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is distributed across Southwest Asia and North Africa. This species breeds on islands and coastal or desert cliffs from Libya to Pakistan). It is a long-distance migrant, wintering in east Africa and south to Madagascar and south-eastern South Africa. Increasingly regular sightings and a lack of historical records suggests that the wintering range has expanded south in recent decades. It is a rare vagrant north of its breeding range.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
The sooty falcon eats mainly birds (e.g. Sandgrouse), but it will take large insects, such as dragonflies, which are transferred from talons to beak and eaten in flight. They have also been known to eat lizards and crabs. During their breeding season they exclusively feed on small birds. 

===Hunting behaviour===
During winter the falcons hunt alone, in groups or even as flocks of up to 15 individuals. These hunting flocks tend to perch on trees and feed on swarming insects. During the breeding, summer, season males do the majority of the hunting. Four hunting techniques are employed: (1) Diving from a perch. The falcons spot prey from their perch and then dive bomb and catch it. (2) Flushing. Flushing is a technique used in which falcon individuals fly low over bushes or trees in an attempts to flush other birds out, after which they catch them. (3) Flying up to come down. When a falcon spots a flying prey bird they try to fly further above it, and then dive down to intercept the prey. (4) Survey flight. Individuals circle areas at great heights in hopes of spotting a prey item. Once prey is spotted the falcon flies down below the prey, and then turns back up into the prey&#x27;s flight path to catch it. 

===Nesting and breeding behaviour===
Sooty Falcons lay eggs during mid-summer, and unlike most other falcons, occasionally nest in colonies. The falcons breed in the arid deserts of Southwest Asia and North Africa during the summer months, which is remarkable due to high summer temperatures. They breed in three types of arid environment: (1) small islands in the Red Sea, (2) mountainous deserts and (3) in deserts with rocky outcrops. It nests on a ledge or on rocks, laying up to four eggs. While the falcons tend to nest on high cliffs, they have also been found nesting between rocks or on the ground. Nests are scraped into soft limestone, chalk or sandstone cliffs, and face away from the sun to provide shelter from its rays. Nest also function as perches from which defense against predators is mounted. 

Birds begin to display and mate during April and May, with eggs being laid by July-August. Egg incubation lasts approximately 27-29 days. Incubation is predominantly performed by the female, while the male only taking shifts for 1-7 minutes while the female sunbathes. Males hunt and bring food to the female and chicks once they have hatched. During the incubation period males provide females with 3-4 birds per day. Excess food is cached on shaded ledges outside the nest. Doing this ensures that food is regulated and that it is available when it is scarce. It also keeps the nests clean, and prevents parasites and pests from being attracted to the nests. The young falcons remain in the nest for 32-38 days, after which they still remain near the nest for a further 2-3 weeks. During this period the parents still take care of them, but thereafter the level of parental care begins to decrease. 

Birds nesting on islands in the Sea of Oman have a mean clutch size of 2.83 and brood size of 2.11, with 12% of nests failing at the egg or nesting stage.

===Migration===
The falcons migrate from their breeding grounds in Southwest Asia and North Africa to winter in Eastern and South-eastern Africa. The journey takes approximately 13 days and covers a distance of 5500 kilometers. The falcons start their migration during the night but tend to travel only during the day. They stop-over at rest spots along Eastern Africa, spots where there are potential water sources. 

==Conservation==
It was formerly classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, but has recently been shown to be rarer than formerly believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to Vulnerable status in 2017. It is estimated that their population ranges between 2800 and 4000 individuals and that these numbers are declining. The breeding population of Sooty falcons on the islands of northern Oman is in decline, with human disturbance on accessible islands a likely cause, as falcons breeding close to beaches have lower nesting success than those breeding further away. Hence, mitigating human disturbances and protecting natural habitats is of critical conservation concern to the Sooty Falcon.

<text>Tuatapere is a small rural town in Southland, New Zealand. It is the self declared &quot;Sausage Capital of New Zealand&quot;. Tuatapere is located eight kilometres from the southern coast. The Waiau River flows through the town before reaching Te Waewae Bay, where it has its outflow into Foveaux Strait. The main local industries are forestry and farming. 

Tuatapere has a logging museum and is located on the Southern Scenic Route from Invercargill to Te Anau making it a well-travelled tourist stop. The Clifden Suspension Bridge and Clifden War Memorial are located near outside Tuatapere.

==History==

===First European settlers===
A group of Hungarians settled in Tuatapere, but were assimilated into the general population by the mid 20th century.

===Railway===
On 1 October 1909, a branch line railway from Invercargill was opened to Tuatapere and it became known as the Tuatapere Branch. On 20 October 1925, an extension was opened to Orawia, 14 kilometres to the north-east but the line continued to be known as the Tuatapere Branch and an engine depot was established in the town. It was used as the base for most operations on the line and the branch was operated as essentially two sections, one from Invercargill to Tuatapere and one from Tuatapere to Orawia. Until 1968, steam locomotives ran all trains to Tuatapere, but in June 1968, the line was dieselised, resulting in the closure of the Tuatapere engine depot. On 1 October 1970, a lack of traffic meant the line was truncated to Tuatapere, and it was further cut on 30 July 1976 when the section between Riverton and Tuatapere closed. Some relics from the railway have been preserved in Tuatapere, including structures in the station area such as the old station building and goods shed.

==2009 Fiordland earthquake==

Tuatapere was one of the closest settlements to the 7.8 magnitude earthquake which occurred on 15 July 2009, the largest in New Zealand since 1931. Despite the earthquake&#x27;s huge force, little damage was sustained and no injuries were reported.

<text>Grey DeLisle (; born Erin Grey Van Oosbree; August 24, 1973), sometimes credited as Grey Griffin, is an American voice actress and singer-songwriter. DeLisle is known for various roles in animated productions and video games. On September 27, 2018, she released her debut comedy act, titled &quot;My First Comedy Special&quot;. On November 10, 2019, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; producers announced that DeLisle would replace Russi Taylor as the voice of Martin Prince and Sherri and Terri, after Taylor&#x27;s death in July 2019. In 2022, she was nominated for the Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice Performance in an Animated Program for her work on &quot;The Loud House&quot;.

==Early life==
DeLisle was born in Fort Ord, California, to truck driver George Van Oosbree and singer Joanna Ruth, and grew up in a Mexican-American household. She has described herself as &quot;a 75% white woman raised by my Mexican grandma&quot;. Her parents separated when she was young. She has two brothers. DeLisle&#x27;s mother became a born-again Pentecostal when she was eleven and she was later raised by her maternal grandmother, Eva Flores, a vocalist who performed with salsa musician Tito Puente. She credits her father&#x27;s love of country music as the biggest influence on her musical taste. She attended Chula Vista High School in the same graduating class as Mario Lopez. In her late teens, she started singing old gospel tunes, and entered the world of comedy on the advice of a friend. In her comedy routine, DeLisle imitated voices. Her impressions earned the attention of a casting director and was advised to take up voice acting. At this time, she went back to her musical ambitions but also took classes in voice-overs. She soon began working with talent agent Sandy Schnarr.

==Career==

As of October 2024, DeLisle has voiced over 2,058 roles in 533 titles, as well as dozens of bit parts in 45 titles in which she is credited with &quot;additional voices&quot;.

In the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise, DeLisle began voicing Daphne Blake with the direct-to-video film &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase&quot;, inheriting the role from her friend and teacher Mary Kay Bergman following the latter&#x27;s suicide. She later said of Bergman, &quot;It was an interesting turn of events to get to play Daphne, but I&#x27;m so glad that I have the role, and I was glad that I was able to carry that on for her. She set the bar very high.&quot; DeLisle also credited the work for helping her maintain her music career, stating &quot;I think Daphne just saved country music.&quot; In 2019, Warner Bros. announced that Amanda Seyfried would be voicing Daphne in the animated film &quot;Scoob!&quot; instead of DeLisle. Both DeLisle and Matthew Lillard, the current voice of Shaggy Rogers were upset about not being contacted about the decision to recast for their roles for the film. Around the time of the film&#x27;s release, DeLisle said that she did not bear any hard feelings towards Seyfried or her performance in it.

==Personal life==
Her first marriage was to Christopher DeLisle in 1992. The two later divorced in 1993 after she accidentally confessed to cheating on him. In 2002, she married Murry Hammond of the alt-country band Old 97&#x27;s; their courtship and wedding were featured in an episode of &quot;A Wedding Story&quot;. She gave birth to their son Jefferson Texas &quot;Tex&quot; Hammond in 2007. They divorced in 2010. She later met Jared Griffin through Twitter, and the two married on June 27, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tara/Grey Interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The couple&#x27;s son Harlan was born in 2014, and a daughter named Mariposa followed in 2016. Their marriage ended the following year.

Her niece is YouTuber Anna Brisbin.

<doc id="1094569" wikidata="Q7966272" url="?curid=1094569" title="Walter Tetley">
<text>Walter Tetley (born Walter Campbell Tetzlaff; June 2, 1915 – September 4, 1975) was an American actor specializing in child impersonation during radio&#x27;s classic era. He had regular roles as Leroy Forrester on &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; and Julius Abbruzzio on &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;, as well as continuing as a voice-over artist in animated cartoons, commercials, and spoken-word record albums. He is perhaps best known as the voice of Sherman in the Jay Ward-Bill Scott &quot;Mr. Peabody&quot; TV cartoons.

==Career==
Tetley&#x27;s foray into voices for theatrical cartoons began in 1936, as the voice of Felix the Cat in three of Van Beuren&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot; cartoon shorts: &quot;The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg&quot;, &quot;Neptune Nonsense&quot;, and &quot;Bold King Cole&quot;. The latter short starts with Tetley singing &quot;Nature and Me&quot;, showcasing his song styling abilities.

In the late 1930s, he was often featured in Fred Allen&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot;. When Allen took his cast to Hollywood to film &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; in 1940, Tetley decided to stay on the west coast, working on several radio shows, including &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, on which he portrayed Gildy&#x27;s nephew Leroy until the show&#x27;s end in 1958.

In the late 1940s, he was the voice of Andy Panda in the Walter Lantz Productions cartoons distributed by Universal Pictures.

In 1946, Tetley supplied the voice of the electric utility mascot Reddy Kilowatt in the short film &quot;Reddy Made Magic&quot;, produced by Lantz with Reddy Kilowatt creator Ashton B. Collins, Sr.; Tetley also performed the film&#x27;s theme song. In 1959 he reprised the role in a John Sutherland-produced remake called &quot;The Mighty Atom&quot;.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Walter would become familiar to a new generation as the voice of Sherman, the nerdy, freckled, bespectacled boy sidekick of time-traveling dog genius Mr. Peabody, in the &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot; segments of Jay Ward&#x27;s &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; (also known as &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;), which made its debut in 1959.

Tetley worked for Capitol Records in the 1950s, providing an array of juvenile voices for the label&#x27;s spoken-word and comedy albums, including &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years&quot; (1961). His &quot;Gildersleeve&quot; co-star, Harold Peary, had made three albums for Capitol a decade earlier, telling children&#x27;s stories Gildersleeve-style.

In 1973 Tetley made an appearance on Rod Serling&#x27;s radio series &quot;The Zero Hour&quot;. He could be heard in the &quot;Princess Stakes Murder&quot; episodes beginning the week of November 19.

&quot;The Sheriff of Fetterman&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, an episode of Serling&#x27;s 1965 TV series &quot;The Loner&quot;, featured guest star Allan Sherman as a character named Walton Peterson Tetley.

==Voice and appearance==
For his entire adult life, Tetley had the voice and appearance of a preteen boy, which led to him largely taking voice roles for young boys. The exact cause was never confirmedwhile co-star Bill Scott half-jokingly claimed that Tetley had been castrated, it is also possible that he had Kallmann syndrome. Whatever the cause, his unusual situation would allow him to hold roles for young boys far longer than actual boys of that age could before their voices would lower due to puberty.

==Death==
In 1971, Tetley was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He died at the age of 60 on September 4, 1975, having never fully recovered from his injuries. His interment was in Chatsworth&#x27;s Oakwood Memorial Park.

<text>Lake Waipori is the smaller and shallower of the pair of lakes located in the wetlands to the south west of Dunedin in New Zealand on the Waipori River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waipori/Waihola Wetland Complex&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Waipori River is a major tributary of the Taieri River, and these wetlands form the southern edge of the Taieri Plains.

The lake is inhabited by various waterfowl and wetland birds. It is however too shallow and inaccessible (due to being surrounded with wetlands) to allow for recreation other than fishing and duck hunting in season.

It is possible to travel from the Waipori River at Berwick through the lake and through to Lake Waihola in a flat bottomed dinghy or jetboat. The lake is too shallow for other forms of motorboat.

The lake is bordered to the southwest by the Sinclair Wetlands.

<text>Spath is a small village located north of Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England. The village is on the River Tean and is separated from Uttoxeter by the A50 road.

== History ==
In UK railway history, Spath was on the now disused Churnet Valley Line, owned and operated by North Staffordshire Railway. The village is notable as the site of the first automatic half barrier crossing in the United Kingdom, which came into operation on 5 February 1961. The railway closed four years later and the road which crossed it via the automatic crossing is now gated. There is no remaining visible sign of the crossing.

Spath was the original home of the Stevensons of Uttoxeter bus company.

<text>Oregon Route 10 is an Oregon state highway which serves Portland and some of its western suburbs.

==Route description==
OR 10 begins as Naito Parkway in Downtown Portland starting where Naito Parkway interchanges with U.S. Route 26. It heads south out of downtown, multiplexed with Oregon Route 99W. After passing under the Portland Aerial Tram, Naito Parkway ends at an interchange with Barbur Boulevard; the two routes continue south out of Portland on Barbur. OR 10 separates from OR 99W a few miles south of downtown, and proceeds along Capitol Highway through the Portland neighborhood of Hillsdale. Along here, it is a surface street, which cuts through the southern part of Portland&#x27;s West Hills. It separates from Capitol Highway in Hillsdale, which continues unnumbered, and becomes the Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, highway number 40, a surface street with frequent traffic signals. The highway continues west into Washington County.

In the community of Raleigh Hills, OR 10 intersects with Oregon Route 210 (locally known as Scholls Ferry Road), which heads southwest towards Progress, Tigard, and Scholls. OR 10 continues west into Beaverton, where it interchanges with Oregon Route 217, a freeway. West of that interchange, the street name changes to Farmington Road, the eastern part of which is not a state highway, and comes a block parallel with Oregon Route 8 in front of Beaverton High School. The portion of OR 10 from downtown Beaverton to the intersection with Oregon Route 219 was once known as Oregon Route 208. OR 8 and 10 do not intersect, but it is not uncommon for commuters to use the frontage road for the OR 217 interchange or another surface street to change between the routes. As Farmington Road, OR 10 leaves Beaverton and cuts across half-developed suburbia to Farmington and its intersection with OR 219. This final section comprises the Farmington Highway, highway number 142.

<doc id="1094579" wikidata="Q2168864" url="?curid=1094579" title="Red light camera">
<text>A red light camera (short for red light running camera ) is a type of traffic enforcement camera that photographs a vehicle that has entered an intersection after the traffic signal controlling the intersection has turned red. By automatically photographing vehicles that run red lights, the photo is evidence that assists authorities in their enforcement of traffic laws. Generally the camera is triggered when a vehicle enters the intersection (passes the stop-bar) after the traffic signal has turned red.

Typically, a law enforcement official will review the photographic evidence and determine whether a violation occurred. A citation is then usually mailed to the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of the law. These cameras are used worldwide, in China, in European countries, and in countries including: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States. More than 75 countries worldwide use red light cameras.

If a proper identification of the driver cannot be made, instead of a ticket, some jurisdictions send out a notice of violation to the owner of the vehicle, requesting identifying information so that a ticket may be issued later. Other jurisdictions simply assess a fine to the owner of the vehicle and make no attempt to determine personal responsibility for the offence beyond that; in such locales owners are responsible for collecting the fine from the offending driver (assuming it is not themselves); however, such jurisdictions generally do not assign demerit points or other personal consequences for traffic offences caught on camera.

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, red-light running is a frequent cause of crashes, with 6,000 people killed between 1992 and 1998, 850 each year in the United States alone, while 1.4 million were injured. In Australia, 15% to 21% of the crashes at signalized intersections were related to red light running during 1994–1998.

There is debate and ongoing research about the use of red light cameras. Authorities cite public safety as the primary reason that the cameras are installed, while opponents contend their use is more for financial gain.
There have been concerns that red light cameras scare drivers (who want to avoid a ticket) into more sudden stops, which may increase the risk of rear-end collisions. The elevated incentive to stop may mitigate side collisions. Some traffic signals have an all red duration, allowing a grace period of a few seconds before the cross-direction turns green. Some studies have confirmed more rear-end collisions where red light cameras have been used, while side collisions decreased, but the overall collision rate has been mixed. A systematic review summarized evidence from 38 studies and found that overall, red-light cameras are effective at reducing right angle crashes and related injuries, as well as total injuries, but they also lead to an increase in rear end crashes. In some areas, the length of the yellow phase has been increased to provide a longer warning to accompany the red-light-running-camera. There is also concern that the international standard formula used for setting the length of the yellow phase ignores the laws of physics, which may cause drivers to inadvertently run the red phase.

==History==

Red light cameras were first developed in the Netherlands by Gatso. Worldwide, red light cameras have been in use since the 1960s, and were used for traffic enforcement in Israel as early as 1969. The first red light camera system was introduced in 1965, using tubes stretched across the road to detect the violation and subsequently trigger the camera. One of the first developers of these red light camera systems was Gatsometer BV.

The cameras first received serious attention in the United States in the 1980s following a highly publicized crash in 1982, involving a red-light runner who collided with an 18-month-old girl in a stroller (or &quot;push-chair&quot;) in New York City. Subsequently, a community group worked with the city&#x27;s Department of Transportation to research automated law-enforcement systems to identify and ticket drivers who run red lights. New York&#x27;s red-light camera program went into effect in 1993. In a near future the might be able to also catch other infractions such as phone usage, failure to wear the seat belt wearing, or failure to maintain safe distance between vehicle. From the 1980s onward, red light camera usage expanded worldwide, and one of the early camera system developers, Poltech International, supplied Australia, Britain, South Africa, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Hong Kong. American Traffic Systems (subsequently American Traffic Solutions) (ATS) and Redflex Traffic Systems emerged as the primary suppliers of red light camera systems in the US, while Jenoptik became the leading provider of red light cameras worldwide.

Initially, all red light camera systems used film, which was delivered to local law enforcement departments for review and approval. The first digital camera system was introduced in Canberra in December 2000, and digital cameras have increasingly replaced the older film cameras in other locations since then.

==Operation==
Red light cameras are typically installed in protective metal boxes attached to poles at intersections, which are often specifically chosen due to high numbers of crashes and/or red-light-running violations. In some case, cameras are built into traffic lights. Red light camera systems typically employ a sensor that detects the presence of a vehicle past the stop bar, and, in some cases, measures the speed of a vehicle at the time it ran the red light. The sensors may be single or dual inductive loops, piezoelectric strips, laser, radar or optical video analyses. Using the speed measured, the system predicts if a particular vehicle will not be able to stop before entering the intersection. In some instances the system takes two or more photographs. The first photo shows the vehicle just before it enters the intersection, with the light showing red, and the second photo, taken a second or two later, shows the vehicle when it is in the intersection.

Details that may be recorded by the camera system (and later presented to the vehicle owner) include: the date and time, the location, the vehicle speed, the amount of time elapsed since the light turned red, and the amount of time elapsed since the light turned yellow and the vehicle passed into the intersection. The event is captured as a series of photographs or a video clip, or both, depending on the technology used, which shows the vehicle before it enters the intersection on a red light signal and its progress through the intersection. The data and images, whether digital or developed from film, are sent to the relevant law enforcement agency. There, the information is typically reviewed by a law enforcement official or police department clerk, who determines if a violation occurred and, if so, approves issuing a citation to the vehicle owner, who may challenge the citation.

Studies have shown that 38% of violations occur within 0.25 seconds of the light turning red and 79% within one second. A few red light camera systems allow a grace period of up to half a second for drivers who pass through the intersection just as the light turns red. Ohio and Georgia introduced a statute requiring that one second be added to the standard yellow time of any intersection that has a red light camera, which has led to an 80% reduction in tickets since its introduction. New Jersey has the strictest yellow timing provisions in the country as a result of concerns that cameras would be used to generate revenue; they have a statute specifying that the yellow time for an intersection that has a red light camera must be based on the speed at which 85% of the road&#x27;s traffic moves rather than be based on the road&#x27;s actual speed limit.

==Usage==
Red light camera usage is widespread in a number of countries worldwide. Netherlands-based Gatso presented red light cameras to the market in 1965, and red light cameras were used for traffic enforcement in Israel as early as 1969. In the early 1970s, red light cameras were used for traffic enforcement in at least one jurisdiction in Europe. Australia began to use them on a wide scale in the 1980s. , expansion of red light camera usage in Australia is ongoing. In some areas of Australia, where the red light cameras are used, there is an online system to check the photograph taken of your vehicle if you receive a ticket. Singapore also began use of red light cameras in the 1980s, and installed the first camera systems during five years, starting in August 1986. In Canada, by 1998, red light cameras were in use in British Columbia and due to be implemented in Manitoba. In Alberta, red light cameras were installed in 1999 in Edmonton and in 2001 in Calgary. The UK first installed cameras in the 1990s, with the earliest locations including eight rail crossings in Scotland where there was greatest demand for enforcement of traffic signals due to fatalities.

===China===
====Mainland China====

Red light camera usage is extensive in mainland China. , approximately 700 intersections in Shenzhen were monitored for red light violations, speeding, or both.

China also has red light camera with facial recognition. Red light offenders, either pedestrian or motorbikers, are captured by a 7 megapixel camera. Within 20 minutes, a facial recognition system identifies personal information including family name, ID number and address which are displayed in the street on an advertising screen. This information can also be published on social media.

According to the owner, in less than four months, in Lianhua intersection in Shenzhen, jaywalking were reduced from 1000 each day to 80.

====Hong Kong====

Hong Kong introduced red light cameras in 1993.

In Hong Kong, where red light cameras are installed, signs are erected to warn drivers that cameras are present, with the aim of educating drivers to stop for signals. The number of red light cameras in Hong Kong doubled in May 2004, and digital red light cameras were introduced at intersections identified by the police and transport department as having the most violations and greatest risk. The digital cameras were introduced to further deter red-light running. As added assistance to drivers, some of the camera posts were painted orange so that drivers could see them more easily. By 2006, Hong Kong had 96 red light cameras in operation. By 2016 this number had risen to 195.

In Hong-Kong, penalty for the failure to comply with traffic signals is a HK$5,000 fine and three months&#x27; jail for a first offense. Penalty for other offenses are a HK$10,000 penalty and six-month term.

In Hong-Kong, red light cameras helped reduce violation jumping by 43 to 55%.

===France===

In France, red light cameras started use in 2009. Cameras catch drivers that fail to stop on a red light. A removal of 4 points on the driving licence will occur.

New multipurpose camera might, such as the Mesta Fusion 2 have several simultaneous capacity in a single device, such as red light camera, Level crossing red light camera and speed camera. In a near future the might be able to also catch other infractions such as phone usage, failure to wear the seat belt wearing, or failure to maintain safe distance between vehicle.

Some insurance companies recommend to comply with regulation to avoid the fine. This implies a speed decrease when approaching a red light, considering it can switch to orange and then to red, avoiding acceleration when light is orange, using the brake (which turn on braking light) to communicate to followers the braking action, and keep the car before the red light stop line.

In the south east quarter of France, red light cameras (MESTA 3000) are provided by Safran; their availability rate is 95%, taking into account road works and acts of vandalism. This availability is considered better than the one observed in Great Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany according to a French National Assembly report.

===Germany===

The first red light camera in Germany was operated in November 1960 the 15th in Frankfurt am Main with black and white photos.

Red light violations result in a fine of €90, and one penalty point is recorded on the driver&#x27;s license . If the light has been red for more than one second when the violation occurs, the fine increases to €200, with two penalty points, and the offender&#x27;s driving license is suspended for one month. In cases of immediate danger, the fine can rise to €320, or to €360 if a crash occurs. A stop line violation incurs a fine of only €10. 

If a driver in their probationary period runs a red light and is caught by a red-light camera, they are required to attend a compulsory retraining seminar (Aufbauseminar). Additionally, the probationary period is extended from two to four years. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom the authorities often refer to red-light cameras, along with speed cameras, as &quot;safety cameras&quot;. They were first used in the early 1990s, with initial deployment by the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. All costs were paid by the local authority in which the individual camera was placed, and revenues accrued from fines were paid to the Treasury Consolidated Fund. In 1998 the government handed the powers of collection to local road-safety partnerships, comprising &quot;... local authorities, Magistrates&#x27; Courts, the Highways Agency and the police.&quot;

In a report, published in December 2005, there were a total of 612 red light cameras in England alone, of which 225 were in London.

In the UK, failure to stop for a red light gives a £100 fine and adds 3 points on the driving license. Some police forces might also register motorists caught running a red light to educational courses.

===United States===


Source: IIHS
Since the early 1990s, red light cameras have been used in the United States in 26 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Within some states, the cameras may only be permitted in certain areas. For example, in New York State, the Vehicle and Traffic Law permits red light cameras only within cities with a population above 1 million (i.e. New York City), Rochester, Buffalo, Yonkers, and Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Florida, a state law went into effect on 1 July 2010, which allows all municipalities in the state to use red light cameras on all state-owned rights-of-way and fine drivers who run red lights, with the aim of enforcing safe driving, according to then-Governor Charlie Crist. The name given to the state law is the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Act, named for a man who was killed in 2003 by a motorist who ran a red light. In addition to allowing the use of cameras, the law also standardizes driver fines.
Major cities throughout the US that use red light cameras include Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Memphis, New Orleans, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle, Toledo, and Washington, D.C. Albuquerque has cameras, but in October 2011 local voters approved a ballot measure advising the city council to cease authorizing the red light camera program. The City of Albuquerque ended its red light program on 31 December 2011.

In March 2017, the city of Chicago changed the period of time between when the light turns red and when the red-light camera is triggered (and a ticket issued) from 0.1 seconds to 0.3 seconds. The &quot;grace period&quot; in Chicago is now in line with other major American cities like New York City and Philadelphia.

Suppliers of red-light cameras in the US include: Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) State and Local Solutions, a Xerox company, of Dallas, Texas; American Traffic Solutions of Scottsdale, Arizona, 1/3 owned by Goldman Sachs; Brekford International Corp., of Hanover, Maryland; CMA Consulting Services, Inc. of Latham, New York; Gatso USA of Beverly, Massachusetts; iTraffic Safety LLC of Ridgeland, South Carolina; NovoaGlobal Inc., of Orlando, Florida; Optotraffic, of Lanham, Maryland; Redflex Traffic Systems of Phoenix, Arizona, with its parent company in Australia; RedSpeed-Illinois LLC, of Lombard, Illinois, whose parent company is in Worcestershire, England; and SafeSpeed LLC, of Chicago, Illinois.

Some states have chosen to prohibit the use of red light cameras. These include Arkansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Texas (phasing out fully by 2021), and West Virginia.

In February 2012, the red light camera ordinance in the city of St. Louis was officially declared void by St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Mark Neill. On 9 August 2012, the Cary, North Carolina town council voted to end their program. In February 2013, the San Diego mayor helped remove a red light camera to keep the campaign promise he made during the November 2012 election to eliminate these systems. New Jersey had to renew the Red Light law by the state legislature in early 2015 and did not do this, making the use of red light cameras illegal in the state afterwards.

In the United States, fines are not standardized and vary to a great degree, from $50 in New York City to approximately $500 in California. The cost in California can increase to approximately $600 if the motorist elects to attend traffic school in order to avoid having a demerit point added to his or her driving record.

====Notice of traffic violation====
In many California police departments, when a positive identification cannot be made, the registered owner of the vehicle will be mailed a &quot;notice of traffic violation&quot; instead of a real ticket. Also known as &quot;snitch tickets,&quot; these notices are used to request identifying information about the driver of the vehicle during the alleged violation. Because these notices have not been filed at court, they carry no legal weight and the registered owner is under no obligation to respond. In California, a genuine ticket will bear the name and address of the local branch of the Superior Court and direct the recipient to contact that court. In contrast, a &quot;notice of traffic violation&quot; generated by the police will omit court information, using statements like &quot;This is not a notice to appear&quot; and &quot;Do not forward this information to the Court.&quot;

In September 2014, a bill was proposed in New Jersey to disallow the state Motor Vehicle Commission from sharing license plate and driver information needed to cite New Jersey drivers accused of committing infractions in another state.

====Decrease since 2012 in the USA====

While the number of red light cameras decreased from 533 in 2012 to 421 in 2018, people killed in red-light crashes increased from 696 in 2012 to 811 in 2016, reflecting a 17% increase.

The reasons for the red light camera discontinuation were reduction in camera citations, difficulty sustaining the financial viability of the program and intense community opposition.

In the USA, surveys indicate the public support for red light camera enforcement; however, the support is decreasing if programs are not adequate, or if perception is focused on revenue rather than on saving lives.
To be successful, a red light camera should focus on safety and transparency, as well as be located in a problematic intersection which needs to be assessed by communities (for instance, for road design and signal timing). It could also take into account public input with stakeholders such as law enforcement, victim advocates, school officials and residents to plan a program.

===Singapore===
In 2014 Singapore started to use German Jenoptik red light cameras, with an 11-megapixel resolution. 240 streets have red light cameras in Singapore.

===New South Wales===

In New South Wales red light cameras were introduced in April 1982 followed by speed cameras in 2009.

In New South Wales there are 191 cameras at 171 intersection. These camera can check both the red light and the speed

During the period of observations were:
* 33% reduction in fatal and serious injury crashes
* 54% reduction in fatalities
* 35% reduction in serious injuries
* 49% reduction in pedestrian casualties.

==Studies and politics==

A report in 2003 by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program examined studies from the previous 30 years in Australia, the UK, Singapore, and the US, and concluded that red light cameras &quot;improve the overall safety of intersections where they are used.&quot; While the report states that evidence is not conclusive (partly due to flaws in the studies), the majority of studies show a reduction in angle crashes, a smaller increase in rear-end crashes, with some evidence of a &quot;spillover&quot; effect of reduced red light running to other intersections within a jurisdiction. These findings are similar to a 2005 meta analysis, which compared the results of 10 controlled before-after studies of red light cameras in the US, Australia, and Singapore. The analysis stated that the studies showed a reduction in crashes (up to almost 30%) in which there were injuries; however, evidence was less conclusive for a reduction in total collisions. Studies of red light cameras worldwide show a reduction of crashes involving injury by about 25% to 30%, taking into account increases in rear-end crashes, according to testimony from a meeting of the Virginia House of Delegates Militia, Police, and Public Safety Committee in 2003. These findings are supported by a review of more than 45 international studies carried out in 2010, which found that red light cameras reduce red light violation rates, crashes resulting from red light running, and usually reduce right-angle collisions.

Amongst the many researched safety benefits of installing RLCs, few studies have examined drivers&#x27; behavior change in relation to red-light cameras showing that at these intersections drivers tended to react quicker to a yellow light change when stopping. The consequence of this change could be the slight decline in the intersection capacity.
In terms of location-specific studies, in Singapore a study from 2003 found that there was &quot;a substantial drop&quot; in red light violations at intersections with red light cameras. In particular the study found that drivers were encouraged to stop more readily in areas with red light cameras in use. A report from civic administrators in Saskatchewan in 2001, when considering red light camera use, referred to studies in the Netherlands and Australia that found a 40% decrease in red light violations and 32% decrease in right-angle crashes where red light cameras were installed. Following the introduction of red light cameras in Western Australia, the number of serious right-angle crashes decreased by 40%, according to an article from the &quot;Canberra Times&quot;. In an article from the Xinhua General News Service, the Hong Kong transport department reported that in 2006 the monthly average number of crashes due to red light violations fell 25% and the number of people injured in these crashes decreased by 30%, following an increase in the number of red light cameras in use.

===North America===

In the U.S. and Canada, a number of studies have examined whether red light cameras produce a safety benefit. A 2005 study by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) suggests red light cameras reduce dangerous right-angle crashes. The FHWA study has been criticized as containing critical methodological and analytical flaws and failing to explain an increase in fatalities associated with red light camera use:(...)the authors spotlight the statistical difficulties of including the cost of fatalities, while ignoring the practical implications of such events (...) assuming that each angle injury crash had a societal cost of $64,468, when in fact the cost was $82,816 before camera use and $100,176 after camera use(...)

Not all studies have been favorable to the use of red light cameras. A 2004 study of 17,271 crashes from North Carolina A &amp; T University showed that the presence of red light cameras &quot;increased&quot; the overall number of crashes by 40%. This research received no peer review and is considered flawed by the IIHS. A 2005 Virginia Department of Transportation study of the long-term effects of camera enforcement in the state found a decrease in the number of right-angle crashes with injuries, but an increase in rear-end crashes and an overall increase in the number of crashes causing injuries. In 2007, the department issued an updated report which showed that the overall number of crashes at intersections with red light cameras increased. This report concluded that the decision to install red light cameras should be made on an intersection-by-intersection basis as some intersections saw decreases in crashes and injuries that justified the use of red light cameras, while others saw increases in crashes, indicating that the cameras were not suitable in that location. This study, too, is considered flawed by the IIHS. Aurora, Colorado experienced mixed results with red light cameras; after starting camera enforcement at 4 intersections, crashes decreased by 60% at one, increased 100% at two, and increased 175% at the fourth. According to the IIHS, most studies suggest the increase in rear-end collisions decreases once drivers have become accustomed to the new dynamics of the intersection. Some locations experience a decrease in rear-end collisions at intersections with red light cameras over time, for instance, in Los Angeles such collisions fell 4.7% from 2008 to 2009. However, a 2010 analysis by the Los Angeles City Controller found L.A.&#x27;s red light cameras had not demonstrated an improvement in safety, specifically that of the 32 intersections equipped with cameras, 12 saw more crashes than before the cameras were installed, 4 had the same number, and 16 had fewer crashes; also that factors other than the cameras may have been responsible for the reduced crashes at the 16 intersections. And in Winnipeg, Manitoba, crashes were found to have significantly increased in the years following the deployment of red light cameras. In 2010, Arizona completed a study of their statewide 76 photo enforcement cameras and decided they would not renew the program in 2011; lower revenue than expected, mixed public acceptance and mixed accident data were cited.

Nevertheless, the FHWA has concluded that the cameras yielded a positive overall cost benefit due to the reduction in more expensive right-angle injury collisions. Other studies have found a greater crash reduction. For example, a 2005 study of the Raleigh, North Carolina, red light camera program conducted by the Institute for Transportation Research and Education at North Carolina State University found right-angle crashes dropped by 42%, rear-end crashes dropped by 25% and total crashes dropped by 17%. In 2010, the IIHS looked at results of a number of studies and found that red light cameras reduce total collisions and particularly reduce the type of crashes that are especially likely to cause injuries. A 2011 IIHS report concluded that the rate of fatal collisions involving red-light running in cities with a population of 200,000 or greater was 24% lower with cameras than it would have been without cameras.

==Opinions==

===United States===
A 2009 Public Opinion Strategies poll which asked, &quot;Do you support or oppose the use of red-light cameras to detect red-light runners and enforce traffic laws in your state&#x27;s most dangerous intersections?&quot; found 69% support and 29% oppose. A 2012 telephone survey of District of Columbia residents published in the journal &quot;Traffic Injury Prevention&quot; found that 87% favored red light cameras.

The National Motorists Association opposes red light cameras on the grounds that the use of these devices raises legal issues and violates the privacy of citizens. They also argue that the use of red light cameras does not increase safety. In the US, AAA Auto Club South argued against the passage of a Florida state law to allow red light cameras, stating that use of red light cameras was primarily for raising money for the state and local government coffers and would not increase road safety. Worse, there are allegations of corruption in shortening the amber to increase the number of tickets. The construction of speed breakers or road bumps were conventional methods of forcing motorists to lower speeds, but were dropped at locales in favor of cameras due to lobbying efforts.

===Canada and Europe===

In Norway, Spain, and the Netherlands, a postal survey in 2003 showed acceptance of the use of red light cameras for traffic enforcement. For some groups, the enforcement of traffic laws is considered the main reason for using the red light cameras. For example, a report from civic administrators in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2001 described the cameras as &quot;simply an enforcement tool used to penalize motorists that fail to stop for red traffic signals.&quot;

==Legal questions and restrictions==

===United States===
 Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have enacted various prohibitions on red light, speed or other photo enforcement camera uses. Texas banned the use of red cameras in 2019. Restrictions or conditions exist in additional states; the New Mexico Department of Transportation, for example, has asserted the right to restrict or prohibit red light cameras on state highways. While red light cameras may not be prohibited in other regions, they may have some restrictions on their use. In some jurisdictions, the law says that the camera needs to obtain a photo of the driver&#x27;s face in order for the citation issued for running the red light to be valid. This is the case in California and Colorado where the red light cameras are set up to take a series of photographs, including one of the driver&#x27;s face. In California, state law assesses a demerit point against a driver who runs a red light, and the need to identify the actual violator has led to the creation of a unique investigatory tool, the fake &quot;ticket.&quot; Groups opposing the use of red light cameras have argued that where the cameras are not set up to identify the vehicle driver, owner liability issues are raised. It is perceived by some that the owner of the vehicle is unfairly penalized by being considered liable for red-light violations although they may not have been the driver at the time of the offense. In most jurisdictions the liability for red light violations is a civil offense, rather than a criminal citation, issued upon the vehicle owner—similar to a parking ticket. The issue of owner liability has been addressed in the US courts, with a ruling in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in 2007, which agreed with a lower court when it found that the presumption of liability of the owners of vehicles issued citations does not violate due process rights. This ruling was supported by a 2009 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in which it was held that issuing citations to vehicle owners (or lessees) is constitutional. The court stated that it also encourages drivers to be cautious in lending their vehicles to others.

The argument that red light cameras violate the privacy of citizens, has also been addressed in the US courts. According to a 2009 ruling by the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, &quot;no one has a fundamental right to run a red light or avoid being seen by a camera on a public street.&quot; In addition, cameras only take photographs or video when a vehicle has run a red light and, in most states, the camera does not photograph the driver or the occupants of the vehicle. It is also argued that such cameras violate the Sixth Amendment&#x27;s Confrontation Clause and the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty.

In most areas, red light enforcement cameras are installed and maintained by private firms. Lawsuits have been raised challenging private companies&#x27; rights to hand out citations, such as a December 2008 lawsuit challenging the city of Dallas&#x27; red light camera program, which was dismissed in March 2009. In most cases, citations are issued by law enforcement officers using the evidence provided by the companies.

There have been many instances where cities in the US have been found to have too-short yellow-light intervals at some intersections where red light cameras have been installed. In Tennessee, 176 drivers were refunded for fines paid after it was discovered that the length of the yellow was too short for that location, and motorists were caught running the light in the first second of the red phase. In California, a combined total of 7,603 tickets were refunded or dismissed by the cities of Bakersfield, Costa Mesa, East LA, San Carlos, and Union City, because of too-short yellows. Although national guidelines addressing the length of traffic signals are available, traffic signal phase times are determined by the government employees of the city, county or state for that signalized location. While some states set jurisdiction-wide constant durations for yellow-light intervals, a new standard is taking hold. States are required to adopt the 2009 National Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as their legal state standard for traffic-control devices since 2011. These standards require engineering practices to be used to set yellow-light-timing durations at individual intersections and or corridors. For guidance to state authorities, MUTCD states yellow lights should have a minimum duration of 3 seconds and a maximum duration of 6 seconds. The deadline for compliance is 2014. In the US, if any part of a driver&#x27;s vehicle has already passed into the intersection when the signal turns red, a violation is not generated. A ticket is only issued if the vehicle enters the intersection while the light is red.

In 2014, a bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives attempting to prohibit red light cameras on federally funded highways and in the District of Columbia.

===Italy===
In 2010, it was revealed that the municipality of Segrate, Italy, two nearby traffic lights had been synchronized such that drivers were coerced to either break the speed limit or pass during the red light. This was investigated as a deliberate fraud to increase the income from tickets. It took months before the machines were eventually dismantled by the Guardia di Finanza.

==Alternatives==
A red light camera is not the only countermeasure against red-light running. Others include increasing the visibility distance and of the traffic light so it is more likely to attract the driver&#x27;s attention in time for him or her to stop, re-timing lights so drivers will encounter fewer red ones, increasing the duration of the yellow light between the green and the red, adding a &quot;clearance&quot; phase to the intersection&#x27;s traffic signals, during which all directions have a red light. It has been posited that the regulatory minimum yellow duration has been decreased over the years, that this is a cause of the increase in red-light running, and that the latter countermeasures amount to a reversion to earlier, longer regulated yellow-light durations.

==History==
The district consists of two pre-unification principalities Argha and Khanchi. Argha (Nepali:अर्घा) was the name given to ritual offerings made at the former principality&#x27;s main Bhagwati Temple. Khanchi may come from the word Khajanchi (Nepali:खजाञ्चि) or tax collector since the center of the latter principality was known for its tax office. Both were two of the Chaubisi rajya (24 principalities) centred in the Gandaki Basin. In 1786 A.D. (1843 BS) during the unification of Nepal the two were annexed by Gorkha. Later the merger was renamed “Arghakhanchi” and added to Gulmi District. Arghakhanchi became a separate district in 1961 A.D. (2018 BS).

<doc id="1094585" wikidata="Q1432708" url="?curid=1094585" title="Renaldo and the Loaf">
<text>Renaldo and the Loaf are an English musical duo formed in 1977 consisting of David &quot;Ted the Loaf&quot; Janssen and Brian &quot;Renaldo Malpractice&quot; Poole. The two released six full-length albums, one live album, and three self-produced demos.

== Sound ==
Renaldo &amp; The Loaf attempted to replicate the sound of synthesizers using acoustic instruments. They manipulated tape loops and muffled and detuned their instruments.

== Background ==

=== Formation (1970–1976) ===
David Janssen and Brian Poole met each other at school in the spring of 1970, when they bonded over a love for Tyrannosaurus Rex and began to play guitar.

=== Early Career (1977–1980) ===
The two had been recording together as early as 1977, creating sound experiments that neither considered &#x27;songs&#x27;. During this period they, along with friend Terry Nichols, worked on a four part instrumental suite titled &#x27;Segment&#x27;, which was completed in the spring of 1978.

After deciding to attempt a more song like structure in September 1978, the duo adopted the moniker &quot;Plimsollline,&quot; and discovered a newspaper ad from a record label named Raw Records asking for artists. The duo responded to this by sending a demo tape, and were quickly signed. At the suggestion of label owner &#x27;Lee&#x27;, the duo recorded an album and EP titled &#x27;Behind Closed Curtains&#x27; and &#x27;Tap Dance In Sushi&#x27; between September 1978 and April 1979, but shortly after the completion of the material, Lee and Raw Records disappeared, and the tapes were shelved. This brief encounter with a record label gave them the confidence they needed to approach larger labels like Virgin and Rough Trade. During their correspondence with Rough Trade, Geoff Travis suggested that the duo invest in a good multi-track tape recorder, a piece of equipment that would become essential to the sound of their debut album, Struve &amp; Sneff. By the time Struve &amp; Sneff began recording in April 1979, the two had already adopted the name &#x27;Renaldo &amp; The Loaf&#x27;.

The sessions for &quot;&#x27;Struve &amp; Sneff&quot;&#x27; became a routine for Poole &amp; Janssen. They would discuss new material and ideas during the midweek, and meet in Janssen&#x27;s bedroom to record the next Saturday. They were both heavily inspired by the popular synthesizer bands of the time, but were unable to afford keyboards themselves, and so recreated synth-like noises using tape effects and treated guitars. Struve &amp; Sneff was completed in September 1979 and was sold through mail order between 1979 and 1983 in a limited quantity of 250.

=== Ralph Years (1981–1987) ===

==== &quot;Songs for Swinging Larvae&quot; (1980–1981) ====
While on Holiday in San Francisco, Brian Poole visited 444 Grove Street, the headquarters of Ralph Records and The Residents. While there, Poole unknowingly met with a member of The Residents, and gave him copy of Struve &amp; Sneff. The Resident listened to the first three tracks, and told him it was excellent. Shortly afterwards, the two began a mail correspondence, where The Resident expressed interest in signing the band to Ralph. During these correspondences, the duo recorded and sent Ralph Records two demo tapes, &quot;Songs For The Surgery&quot; recorded from November 1979 to Mid 1980, and &quot;Hats Off, Gentlemen!&quot; completed in Autumn of 1980. These, combined with Struve &amp; Sneff, were enough for Ralph, and Jay Clem, representative for the label, was sent to England to sign them. After this, the two started working on their first LP, &quot;Songs For Swinging Larvae&quot;, recording and writing new songs for it throughout late 1980, as well as overdubbing material from their Ralph demos. The album was finished in November 1980, and production on its follow-up, Arabic Yodeling, began almost immediately afterwards in December.

Lyrically, the album was inspired by classical European literature, with Medical Man being a direct adaption of the first chapter of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s The Sign of the Four, Spratt&#x27;s Medium being inspired by Samuel Beckett&#x27;s Endgame and Ow! Stew the Red Shoe! taking lyrics from four short stories by Beckett found in a collection titled &#x27;First Love&#x27;. The album title is a play on Frank Sinatra&#x27;s Songs For Swinging Lovers.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Poole and Janssen travelled to San Francisco in late February to film their Songs For Swinging Larvae music video in March. The idea was originally to film a video for &#x27;Is Guava A Donut?&#x27;, but Ralph suggested making the video a narrative about a recent abduction story. The video, directed by Graeme Whifer, would combine three songs recorded during the album&#x27;s sessions, Spratt&#x27;s Medium, Lime Jelly Grass, and an outtake, Melvyn&#x27;s Repose. They knew the video would be controversial, but thought it would get them noticed.

After the video was completed The Residents invited the duo to their studio, where they jammed. After the session, The Residents suggested that they record an album together in the remaining three days of their visit, by taking the jam and adding overdubs. On the second day, they were split into two groups. Brian Poole and his half of The Residents were set to devise lyrics and singing, while Dave Janssen and his half were set to consider overdubs. On the third day overdubs would be recorded, and on day four it would be mixed. This demo tape was titled &#x27;4 Daze&#x27; and was left incomplete when the two returned to England. A few weeks after they had returned, they received a cassette tape of the demo with additional overdubs made by The Residents.

Songs For Swinging Larvae, along with the music video, were released in the US through Ralph Records on April 10, 1981, and in the UK two months later in June.

==== &quot;Arabic Yodeling&quot; and &quot;Title in Limbo&quot; (1982–1983) ====
Following the release of Songs For Swinging Larvae, the two began working on their third demo tape, titled &#x27;The Serious Collection&#x27;, which was sent to Ralph after its completion in July 1982. The material on this tape developed into much of their third album, &quot;Arabic Yodelling&quot;. The album was inspired by Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry and the works of Charles Baudelaire. It was completed in January 1983, and was the first album by Renaldo &amp; The Loaf to feature a guest musician, violinist Dave Baker, who was a friend of Brian Poole&#x27;s. Baker and Janssen never met. It was also their first album to feature traditional keyboards, as the group had purchased a Casiotone 202 for use as Renaldo &amp; The Loaf. Unlike Songs For Swinging Larvae and Struve &amp; Sneff, the album would not have a U.K release, and would have had to have been imported from Ralph in the US by British fans.

When The Residents visited London on their Mole Show tour on June 28, 1983, David and Brian met with The Residents backstage to discuss their &#x27;4 Daze&#x27; collaboration that they had worked together on 2 years prior. The Residents had time in their schedule to finish it in September, and so three weeks of the month were chosen for them to complete the album. Unfortunately, Janssen was unable to get time off to visit San Francisco and so Brian went by himself, taking with him tape loops created by Dave, a Bouzouki, a Rababa, and a reed instrument known as a Mesmer. Sessions for the album continued over three weeks, with The Residents&#x27; usual equipment being in transit&lt;ref name=&quot;Title in Limbo w/The Residents&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; from their Leicestershire Mole Show performance in July. They used a Yamaha Keyboard, a &#x27;Resitar&#x27; electric guitar, a drum machine and a violin, used by Snakefinger on the track &#x27;Africa Tree&#x27; The album, titled &quot;Title in Limbo&quot;, was released in November 1983.

==== &quot;The Elbow Is Taboo&quot; (1984–1987) ====
&quot;Title in Limbo&quot; had made more money than any of their previous projects and gave the duo the budget they needed improve their recording set up. Brian Poole created a home studio which, unlike Janssen&#x27;s bedroom, featured full mixing equipment. Poole felt this somewhat stifled his creative input, now that he was no longer able to record whenever he felt like. The duo also now had a sampler, a Roland TR-606 drum machine and a Korg SDD-1000 digital delay unit.

They began recording their follow-up to &quot;Arabic Yodeling&quot; in early 1984, with sessions continuing throughout the entirety of 1985 and finishing in late 1986. During this period the duo released two archival works, a re-edited LP version of Struve &amp; Sneff, which included five outtakes from the original sessions was released, and, in 1985, a compilation titled &#x27;Olleh Olleh Rotcod.&#x27; This compilation contained rare tracks by the band, as well as two excerpts from the &quot;Elbow is Taboo&quot; sessions, &quot;Critical/Dance&quot; and the title track.

By the time &quot;The Elbow Is Taboo&quot; was complete, Ralph were no longer acting as the duo&#x27;s primary record label, as they had moved on to the UK based Some Bizzare records, Ralph would still release the album in the US, but were significantly less involved in the product&#x27;s creation. With their previous albums, Poole and Jansseen would begin work on the follow-up as soon as the master tapes had been sent to Ralph, but in this case, the duo were not pleased with the proposed artwork created by Bizarre and had to take new photographs to be used instead. This caused significant delays in the album&#x27;s release and exhausted the band. They discussed ideas for a follow-up at the time, but found it difficult to start anything. The album was inspired partly by French band Ptôse, whose song &#x27;Boule&#x27; was covered by the duo.

In 1987 they recorded a cover version of &quot;Haul on the Bowline&quot; for the Ralph Records anthology album &quot;Potatoes&quot;, shortly after, the duo retired.

=== Solo Works (1989–2015) ===
Two years after the retirement of Renaldo &amp; The Loaf, Brian Poole began working with Kwesi Marles (Who had assisted Renaldo &amp; The Loaf on the Hambu Hodo EP), and formed a group named &#x27;Shouting Hat&#x27;. They recorded an unreleased cover of &#x27;Ravel&#x27;s Bolero!&#x27; in 1989, and then a track titled &#x27;Jump Jump&#x27; on the 1993 TEC Tones compilation &quot;&#x27;Goobers&quot;&#x27; under the name Fiction Friends. Around this same time, TEC Tones began releasing Renaldo &amp; The Loaf&#x27;s Ralph albums on CD.

In 1996 Poole worked with Frank Pahl on two songs, &#x27;Value of Slacks&#x27;, for his album &#x27;In Cahoots&#x27;, and &#x27;Portsmouth&#x27; for his album &#x27;Remove The Cork&#x27; In 1998, Title In Limbo was released on CD through Ralph America, followed by a CD issue of the original version of Sturve &amp; Sneff from The Esoteric Music Group. Between 2002 and 2003 Poole also worked with The Moles on two tracks, &#x27;Mole in a Hole&#x27; and &#x27;We Are The Moles&#x27;. In 2005, he was asked by director and multi-instrumentalist Alex Wroten to collaborate on the end credits music for his film The Human Elbow.

19 years following his last release, Dave Janssen released a solo album titled &#x27;The Entomology of Sound&#x27; under the pseudonym &#x27;The Darkening Scale&#x27;. The same year he also released his second album, &#x27;Sonic Archaeology&#x27;, also as The Darkening Scale. The Darkening Scale was last active in 2020. From 2007 to 2008 Janssen briefly adopted the pseudonym &#x27;Lightness Ascending&#x27;.

=== Reunions (2006–2013) ===
The duo were reunited in 2006, to create the Renaldoloaf.co.uk website. The year afterwards, they were commissioned to record three songs for the soundtrack to &quot;Kirk Mannican’s Liberty Mug.&quot; Six years after they were asked by record label Klanggalerie to create a song for a compilation album &quot;Section 25: Eigengrau.&quot; For this the duo created &#x27;Girls Don&#x27;t Count (The Critical Mix)&#x27;

==== &quot;Gurdy Hurding&quot; (2016–present) ====
In October 2016 the duo released their first studio album in 30 years, &quot;Gurdy Hurding&quot;. In June 2018 they performed at the Klanggalerie 25th Anniversary celebration, for which they performed their second ever live show since their formation. The following year they released the EP &quot;Song of the Lungfish&quot;, and in 2020, released two singles relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Influence ==
Notable artists influenced by Renaldo &amp; The Loaf include The Residents, Frank Pahl, and Andrew Liles. The Residents, along with having worked with the duo, covered the three songs featured in Renaldo &amp; The Loaf&#x27;s Songs For Swinging Larvae music video for their Icky Flix project in 2001. Andrew Liles collaborated with the duo on his album &#x27;Black Pool&#x27; in 2007 and performed songs written by them on the album. Frank Pahl worked with Brian Poole in the 1990s and the two co-wrote the song &#x27;The Value Of Slacks&#x27; together. In 2021, Klanggalerie released &quot;Hardly Gurning While The World Is Turning&quot;, a reworked version of &quot;Gurdy Hurding&quot;, featuring remixes from various artists such as Cult With No Name, Eric Drew Feldman, Andrew Liles, Section 25, Transglobal Underground, and The Residents.

<doc id="1094586" wikidata="Q1531411" url="?curid=1094586" title="Manawatū Gorge">
<text>The Manawatū Gorge () is a steep-sided gorge formed by the Manawatū River in the North Island of New Zealand. At long, the Manawatū Gorge divides the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges, linking the Manawatū and Tararua Districts. It lies to the northeast of Palmerston North. Its western end is near the small town of Ashhurst and its eastern end is close to the town of Woodville.

As one of the few links between the eastern and western North Island, the gorge is an important transport link, with the Palmerston North–Gisborne Line passing through the gorge, as well as State Highway 3; the road has been closed since 2017. Recreationally, the gorge is part of the Manawatū Gorge Scenic Reserve, with various walking tracks through the surrounding native bush.

Like many important geographic features in New Zealand, the creation and exploration of Manawatū Gorge is an embedded part of traditional Māori history. According to tradition, the first Māori to discover the gorge was Whātonga, an explorer from the Kurahaupō canoe, who found the gorge in about the 12th century. Europeans began to traverse the Manawatū Gorge around the 1840s; in 1842 Bishop George Augustus Selwyn and Chief Justice William Martin passed through the gorge to reach the Wairarapa.

==Etymology==
The Manawatū Gorge takes its name from the river which cuts through it, the Manawatū River. The river&#x27;s name, which means &#x27;heart standing still&#x27;, is derived from the words &quot;manawa&quot;, meaning heart, and &quot;tū&quot;, meaning coming to a halt. This comes from traditional Māori history, in which it is said that Haunui-a-nanaia uttered the phrase when he caught sight of the river in his search for his wife Wairaka.

&quot;Te Āpiti&quot; is the Māori name for the gorge, which is usually translated to mean &#x27;the narrowing&#x27;, or &#x27;the narrow passage&#x27;. The gorge was also sometimes given the name &quot;Te Au-rere-a-te-tonga&quot;.

==Geography==
The Manawatu Gorge is significant because, unlike most gorges, the Manawatu River is a water gap, that is it runs directly through the surrounding ranges from one side to the other. This was caused by the ranges moving upwards at the same time as the gorge was eroded by the river, instead of the more usual erosion of an already existing range.

The Manawatu River is the only river in New Zealand that starts its journey in the Tararua District on one side of the main divide, and finishes it on the other side near Foxton in the Tasman Sea.

==Transport==

The road through the Manawatu Gorge, State Highway 3, is on the south side of the river, and was completed in 1872. It was the primary link between the two sides of the lower North Island, before being abandoned in 2017 due to the number of slips. Other than Saddle Road and the Pahiatua Track, both narrow winding local roads a few kilometers north and south of the Manawatu Gorge, the gorge was the only east-west road connection between the Akatarawa Valley, to the south, and SH5 between Taupo and Napier to the north.

The road through the Manawatu Gorge had a history of sometimes being closed by slips, especially following inclement weather.

A single track rail connection on the northern side of the gorge was completed in 1891 and is now part of the Palmerston North–Gisborne Line. The rail connection is mainly used by goods trains, with no passenger rail services currently scheduled through the gorge. Occasional railway excursions, typically with steam trains, make use of the scenic Manawatu Gorge Railway line with its two tunnels and several small bridges.

The Old Gorge Cemetery lies on the north side of the Manawatu Gorge. Public access is available, but the cemetery was closed many years ago to further burials. The road is located just a few kilometres out of Woodville on the north side of the gorge.

In 2011 the gorge was closed after several massive landslips. It did not reopen until August 2012, and parts of the highway were still limited to one lane.
In October 2012 it was temporarily closed so contractors could destroy large rocks that posed a threat to traffic. Restoration was completed in November 2012.

SH3 was blocked again for one month by further slips after severe weather on 9 April 2015.

In April 2017, the Manawatu Gorge was closed again due to a large slip. Contractors were pulled out of clearing the slip in July 2017 due to ongoing geological movement in the hill, closing the road indefinitely.

A further slip in July 2017 at the Ashhurst end of the Manawatu Gorge left an additional 10,000 cubic metres of rock on the road. Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency decided to close the Gorge route permanently. The authority investigated long-term options to bypass or replace the gorge route, with their final list having four options.

The chosen new route option, delayed from December 2017 and announced in March 2018, will be above the Gorge, but below the Saddle Road, and will bypass Ashurst.

==Manawatu Gorge Track==

A tramping track, the Manawatu Gorge Track, runs parallel to the gorge on the south side through native bush.

The walking track passes several lookout points, one of which is above the site of the 2015 landslide, aptly called the &quot;Big Slip Lookout&quot;. The majority of the track leads through native bush, with the lookouts offering views overlooking the gorge and towards the Te Āpiti Wind Farm continuing on the hills north of the gorge.

Also along the track, in the midst of native bush, stands the tall metal sculpture of Whatonga, one of three recognised Māori chiefs on board the &quot;Kurahaupo Waka&quot;, which journeyed across the ocean to New Zealand. The statue was funded by the Manawatu Gorge Biodiversity stakeholder group and is made of steel. It was lowered to its location in the bush by helicopter, and blessed at a dawn ceremony on 11 April 2014. The artwork on the sculpture features hammerhead shark patterns and depicts elements of the story of Whatonga&#x27;s sea voyage, as well as emblems of all of the Manawatu Gorge biodiversity project stakeholders.

Up to date information on all walking and biking tracks is available on the Te Āpiti website.

<text>Brian Con Penton (21 August 1904 – 24 August 1951) was an Australian journalist and novelist. He was born at Ascot, a suburb of Brisbane, and educated at Brisbane Grammar School.

==Writing career==
In 1921 Penton found employment as a copy-boy on the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; and went on to work on &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Daily Express&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; in London and Sir Frank Packer&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in Sydney. He eventually became the editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He also did some speech-writing for the Australian prime minister Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and for Bruce&#x27;s predecessor Billy Hughes. In addition, he worked as a political and social commentator and published a number of works criticizing the political regimes of the day.

Penton wrote two novels, which sold quite well: &quot;Landtakers&quot; (1934), which chronicles pioneering life in Queensland from 1824 to 1864, and a sequel &quot;Inheritors&quot; (1936). One of the principal characters in these books is said to be based on Patrick Mayne of the Mayne Inheritance.

William Dobell won the 1943 Archibald Prize (awarded January 1944) with his caricature portrait of Joshua Smith (artist). In the ensuing controversy Penton sided with Dobell, both in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and in his 1946 book on Dobell. The book includes a reproduction of Dobell&#x27;s caricature portrait of Penton, submitted to the same Archibald exhibition.

Penton Place, in the Canberra suburb of Gilmore, is named in his honour.

<doc id="1094612" wikidata="Q289045" url="?curid=1094612" title="Doveridge">
<text>Doveridge is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, United Kingdom, near the border with Staffordshire and about east of Uttoxeter. Its name may come from its having a bridge over the river Dove (i.e. Dove(B)ridge), a tributary of the River Trent. The civil parish population (including Oaks Green) as taken at the 2011 Census was 1,622.

Doveridge has a pub, the &quot;Cavendish Arms&quot;, a village shop, and a working men&#x27;s club. The village also has a football team and a cricket team, both quite successful in their local leagues.

==History==
Doveridge was recorded in the Domesday Book, under the old English name &quot;Dubbige&quot;, as belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth one hundred shillings.

According to legend, Robin Hood and Maid Marian were married under the old yew tree in the churchyard of St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church in the village. The church is over 900 years old and has an historic peal of bells.

Doveridge hall, designed in the neoclassical style and completed in 1769, was the seat of Sir Henry Cavendish, 1st Baronet; it was demolished in 1938. This branch of the Cavendish family holds the title of Baron Waterpark.

The A50 from Derby to Stoke-on-Trent used to run through the village. In the 1960s it was planned to widen this road, and Cavendish Lodge, a splendid 16 room, 17th century hunting lodge, belonging to the Lewis family, was knocked down. Shortly afterwards the road widening plan was dropped; however a by-pass was built in 1998 to the north of the village.

==Governance==
The village has its own civil parish.

Doveridge is part of the Doveridge and Sudbury ward in Derbyshire Dales District Council and is represented by Jacqueline Allison, an Independent who won this normally safe Conservative seat in 2019 election.

Doveridge is part of the Derbyshire Dales constituency.

==Public services==
Despite being in Derbyshire, Doveridge uses the Uttoxeter (01889) area code.

==Transport==
The A50 runs to the north of the village and is the main way into the village.

Doveridge has 5 bus Stops and is served by routes 1 and 1E.

The Nearest Railway station is Uttoxeter.

The nearest airport is East Midlands.

==Media==
The local newspapers covering the area are the &quot;Uttoxeter Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Uttoxeter Post and Times&quot;.

The BBC local radio station is BBC Radio Derby and the local independent station is Capital East Midlands.

Doveridge is covered by the Central ITV and BBC East Midlands TV regions.

<doc id="1094615" wikidata="Q5912882" url="?curid=1094615" title="Hough function">
<text>In applied mathematics, the Hough functions are the eigenfunctions of Laplace&#x27;s tidal equations which govern fluid motion on a rotating sphere. As such, they are relevant in geophysics and meteorology where they form part of the solutions for atmospheric and ocean waves. These functions are named in honour of Sydney Samuel Hough.

Each Hough mode is a function of latitude and may be expressed as an infinite sum of associated Legendre polynomials; the functions are orthogonal over the sphere in the continuous case. Thus they can also be thought of as a generalized Fourier series in which the basis functions are the normal modes of an atmosphere at rest.

<doc id="1094618" wikidata="Q6011285" url="?curid=1094618" title="In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country">
<text>In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country is an EP by Scottish electronic music duo Boards of Canada. It was released by Warp and music70 on 27 November 2000, in the period between the duo&#x27;s albums &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; and &quot;Geogaddi.&quot; Like those albums, it was well received by critics. It peaked at number 15 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Originally pressed on blue vinyl, the vinyl version of the EP was reissued on black vinyl in 2013.

==Background==
The four-track collection centers around the theme of the Branch Davidian religious sect and their Waco retreat. The title of the EP refers to a vocoder-processed and slowed voice sample used on the third track, which repeats &quot;come out and live in a religious community in a beautiful place out in the country.&quot; This line was spoken by Amo Bishop Roden, after whom the second track is named, in an interview for the &quot;Mysteries, Magic &amp; Miracles&quot; TV series. Amo Bishop Roden, the widow of David Koresh rival George Roden, reoccupied the Waco site after its destruction, sleeping in a ditch near the property until federal authorities who had been keeping her away finally abandoned it.

==Critical reception==

According to Metacritic, &quot;In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country&quot; received an average score of 78 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 12 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;. Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Ben Cardew said, &quot;this four-song release stands as its own beast, the pinnacle of the Scottish duo’s ability to soundtrack the moment when ecstasy succumbs to doubt.&quot;

<doc id="1094619" wikidata="Q542278" url="?curid=1094619" title="Christine Milne">
<text>Christine Anne Milne (; born 14 May 1953) is an Australian politician who served as a Senator for Tasmania. She was the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the Australian Greens from 2012 to 2015. Milne stepped down as leader on 6 May 2015, replaced by Richard Di Natale.

==Early life and education==
Milne was born in Latrobe, Tasmania, the second daughter of Wesley Vale dairy farmers Tom and June Morris. She attended Wesley Vale Area School from 1959 to 1963, St Mary&#x27;s College, Hobart as a boarder from 1964 to 1969, and completed her final year of schooling at Devonport High School in 1970.

She studied history and political science at the University of Tasmania from 1971 to 1974, where she resided at Ena Waite University College and was elected its President. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in Australian History, and a Certificate of Education in March 1975.

From 1975 to 1984 Milne worked as a secondary school teacher, teaching English, History and Social Science at Parklands High School, Devonport High School and Don College. She first came to public attention for her role in opposing the building of the Wesley Vale pulp mill near Bass Strait in North Western Tasmania on the basis of its environmental impact. She also participated in the ultimately successful campaign opposing the Franklin Dam and was arrested and jailed in 1983. She worked as a research officer with the Australian Bicentennial Historical Records Search from 1987 to 1988.

==Political career==
Milne was first elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1989 as a member of the Tasmanian Greens in the electorate of Lyons, one of five Green politicians elected at that election. She was part of the Labor–Green Accord, a political agreement between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Tasmanian Greens to form government after the 1989 general election had resulted in a hung parliament. When Bob Brown stood down in 1993 to contest the federal election, she became leader of the Greens in the Tasmanian Parliament and the first female leader of a political party in Tasmania.

She oversaw a loose alliance between the Greens and Labor after the 1996 general election. During that time, Tasmania saw significant economic and social reform. Measures included gun law reform, liberalisation of gay laws, an apology to the Indigenous stolen generation and support for an Australian republic.

In 1998, the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly from 35 to 25 seats, increasing the quota of votes required to be elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Liberal Premier Tony Rundle immediately called an election, which his party subsequently lost. Due to the changes, Milne lost her seat, leaving the Greens with one remaining seat.

After her career in state politics, Milne was an adviser to Senator Bob Brown from 2000 until she was elected to represent Tasmania in the Federal Senate at the 2004 federal election. Preferences to Family First from the Australian Labor Party almost prevented her from being elected; however, she managed to reach a quota mostly as a result of the high level of below-the-line voting in Tasmania. The other Green elected at that election was Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. Milne was part of Bob Brown&#x27;s frontbench covering the portfolios of Arts, Climate change, Competition Policy &amp; Small Business, Finance &amp; Administration, Food Security, Regional Australia, Resources &amp; Energy, and Trade.

Milne was Vice-President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union) from 2005 to 2008. She became Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens on 10 November 2008.

In 2009, Milne debated the shortcomings of Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009 in the federal parliament.

On 13 April 2012, Milne became the leader of the Australian Greens after the resignation of Bob Brown. She reorganised the Green&#x27;s front bench.

On 6 May 2015, Milne announced her immediate resignation from the leadership of the Australian Greens, and foreshadowed her departure from the Senate. Milne resigned from the Senate on 10 August 2015.

<text>Oregon Route 8, also known as Oregon Highway 8, is an Oregon state highway which serves the western suburbs of Portland. The road is locally known as Canyon Road and Tualatin Valley Highway, and travels through the center of the Tualatin Valley. Oregon 8 is located entirely within Washington County. The portion of the route from US 26 to Oregon Route 47 is part of the National Highway System, listed as a principal arterial.

==Route description==
The eastern terminus of OR 8 is an interchange with U.S. Route 26 (which is, at that point, the Sunset Highway) just west of the Portland city limits and the Washington-Multnomah county line. Initially, it is also known as Canyon Road, since it comes out of the gulch in which the Sunset Highway runs. The official designation, beginning from the eastern terminus, is the Tualatin Valley Highway No. 29 (see Oregon highways and routes).
Continuing west, OR 8 enters the suburb of Beaverton, and after its interchange with Oregon Route 217, a freeway, its posted name changes to the Tualatin Valley (TV) Highway at Hocken Avenue. It comes within one block of Oregon Route 10, running parallel but never intersecting, although commuters often use surface streets to change between the highways.

TV Highway continues west as an expressway out of Beaverton, through the communities of unincorporated urban Washington County, including Aloha, where it runs right next to chipmaker Intel&#x27;s facilities. The highway continues into the Hillsboro neighborhoods of Reedville and Witch Hazel, where it intersects with Cornelius Pass Road at Reedville. It then continues into the city proper of Hillsboro, running north–south as 10th Avenue before turning east–west with traffic split into a one-way pair. Westbound traffic runs as Baseline Street and eastbound traffic runs on Oak Street. In downtown Hillsboro it receives the northern terminus of Oregon Route 219, which is 1st Avenue.
After passing through downtown Hillsboro, OR 8 moves westward through the adjoined towns of Cornelius and Forest Grove, passing next to Pacific University. At Cornelius the road is again split into a one-way pair, with westbound traffic running on Adair Street, and eastbound on Baseline. In Forest Grove, it intersects with Oregon Route 47, where it becomes part of the Nehalem Highway No. 102. TV Highway continues as OR 47 south to McMinnville. In downtown Forest Grove the road splits again, with eastbound traffic running on 19th Street, and westbound on Pacific Avenue. West of Forest Grove, OR 8 is known as Gales Creek Road, which is not actually a state highway; after passing through some farmland west of Forest Grove, including the community of Gales Creek, OR 8 reaches its western terminus in an intersection with Oregon Route 6 south of the community of Glenwood.

==History==
The section between Beaverton and Hillsboro was built around 1918. Constructed of cement, it partly replaced a county road built of dirt that ran on the southern side of the railroad tracks. The earlier road came from Portland via Bertha Blvd. on Farmington Road and veered north on what is now Kinnaman Road until 209th Avenue in Reedville, where it then ran parallel to the rail tracks. At Witch Hazel it then followed the modern Witch Hazel and River roads into Hillsboro proper.

In March 1919, Hillsboro elected to have the highway moved from Main Street two blocks south to Baseline Street (eastbound traffic was later moved to Oak Street). Washington County planners in March 1953 decided to have the highway widened to four lanes.

<text>Wellington Bartley Willoughby, (August 10, 1859 – August 1, 1932) was a Canadian politician and lawyer.

He ran for a seat in the Dominion House of Commons for the Conservative Party in the 1895 election, but an unofficial Tory, William Stubbs backed by the Orange Order such as its Grand Master N.C. Wallace and McCarthyite leader Dalton McCarthy undermined his campaign, though he was also an Orangeman.

Willoughby served as leader of the Saskatchewan Conservative Party and leader of the opposition from 1912 to 1917 and was Member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLA) for the city of Moose Jaw.

He resigned from the Saskatchewan legislature shortly after his re-election in the 1917 election in order to accept an appointment to the Senate of Canada by Sir Robert Borden.

In 1929, the leader of the federal Conservative Party, Richard Bennett, appointed Willoughby to the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. When Bennett became Prime Minister of Canada following the 1930 federal election, Willoughby became Government Leader in the Senate and a minister without portfolio in the Canadian Cabinet.

== Personal life ==
Willoughby was born August 10, 1859 in Caledon, Ontario, to John and Margaret Willoughby, two Episcopalian Methodists who worked as farmers. He had 7 siblings; William, who was 4 years older, Lydia, Samuel, Caroline, Wesley, John, and Margaret, who were all younger.

In October 1892, Wellington married Susan Thomas Jones of Germantown, Philadelphia. His wife would pass away June 27, 1907, of Endocarditis.

He died August 1, 1932, of throat cancer. He is buried at the Rosedale Cemetery in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

<doc id="1094648" wikidata="Q201299" url="?curid=1094648" title="Hairy cell leukemia">
<text>Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. The incidence of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is 0.28-0.30 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and the United States and the prevalence is 3 cases per 100,000 in Europe with a lower prevalence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

HCL has an indolent course but with frequent relapses, but with treatment life expectancy is usually the same as that for the general population.

HCL was originally described as histiocytic leukemia, malignant reticulosis, or lymphoid myelofibrosis in publications dating back to the 1920s. The disease was formally named leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, and its characterization was significantly advanced by Bertha Bouroncle and colleagues at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in 1958. Its common name, which was coined in 1966, is derived from the &quot;hairy&quot; appearance of the cytoplasmic projections from malignant B cells under a microscope.
==Signs and symptoms==
In HCL, the &quot;hairy cells&quot; (malignant B lymphocytes) accumulate in the bone marrow, interfering with the production of normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Consequently, patients may develop infections related to low white blood cell count, anemia and fatigue due to a lack of red blood cells, or easy bleeding due to a low platelet count.

Platelet function may be somewhat impaired in HCL patients, although this does not appear to have any significant practical effect.

Patients with a high tumor burden may also have somewhat reduced levels of cholesterol, especially in patients with an enlarged spleen.

Those with HCL rarely have constitutional symptoms such as fevers, chills, weight loss or rigors. 20-30% may have opportunistic infections due to an impairment in immune function. Rarely, in recurrent disease, bone lesions may be present which can be confused for other malignancies such as multiple myeloma.

==Cause==
As with many cancers, the cause of HCL is unknown. Exposure to tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, or industrial chemicals (with the possible exception of diesel) does not appear to increase the risk of developing it. Farming and gardening correlate with an increased risk of HCL development in some studies which does not necessarily imply causation.

A 2011 study identified somatic &quot;BRAF&quot; V600E mutations in all 47 HCL patients studied, and no such mutations in the 193 peripheral B-cell lymphomas/leukemias other than HCL.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) found a correlation which permits an association between exposure to herbicides and later development of chronic B-cell leukemias and lymphomas in general. The IOM report emphasizes that neither animal nor human studies indicate an association of herbicides with HCL specifically. However, the IOM extrapolated data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma to conclude that HCL and other rare B-cell neoplasms may share this risk factor.

Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 (HTLV-2) has been isolated in a small number of patients with the variant form of HCL. In the 1980s, HTLV-2 was identified in a patient with a T-cell lymphoproliferative disease; this patient later developed HCL, but HTLV-2 was not found in the hairy cell clones. There is no evidence that HTLV-II causes any sort of hematological malignancy, including HCL.

In a small population based study, there was an increased incidence of HCL in those who used or handled pesticides.

==Pathophysiology==
Pancytopenia in HCL is caused primarily by marrow failure and splenomegaly. Bone-marrow failure is caused by the accumulation of hairy cells and reticulin fibrosis in the bone marrow, as well as by the detrimental effects of dysregulated cytokine production. Splenomegaly reduces blood counts through sequestration, marginalization, and destruction of healthy blood cells inside the spleen.

Hairy cells are nearly mature B cells, which are activated clonal cells with signs of &quot;VH&quot; gene differentiation. They may be related to pre-plasma marginal zone B cells or memory B cells.

Cytokine production is disturbed in HCL. Hairy cells produce and thrive on TNF-alpha. This cytokine also suppresses normal production of healthy blood cells in the bone marrow.

Unlike healthy B cells, hairy cells express and secrete an immune system protein called interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). In HCL-V, only part of this receptor is expressed. As a result, disease status can be monitored by measuring changes in the amount of IL-2R in the blood serum.

Hairy cells respond to normal production of some cytokines by T cells with increased growth. Treatment with interferon-alpha suppresses the production of this pro-growth cytokine from T cells. A low level of T cells, which is commonly seen after treatment with cladribine or pentostatin, and the consequent reduction of these cytokines, is also associated with reduced levels of hairy cells.

Nearly all cases of HCL have the &quot;BRAF&quot; mutation V600E, and it is proposed that this is the disease&#x27;s driver mutation. Until this point, only a few genomic imbalances had been found in the hairy cells, such as trisomy 5 had been found. The expression of genes is also dysregulated in a complex and specific pattern. The cells underexpress 3p24, 3p21, 3q13.3-q22, 4p16, 11q23, 14q22-q24, 15q21-q22, 15q24-q25, and 17q22-q24 and overexpress 13q31 and Xq13.3-q21. It has not yet been demonstrated that any of these changes have any practical significance to the patient.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of HCL may be suggested by abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC), but additional testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A CBC normally shows low counts for white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in HCL patients. However, if large numbers of hairy cells are in the blood stream, then normal or even high lymphocyte counts may be found.

On physical examination, 80–90% of patients have an enlarged spleen, which can be massive. This is less likely among patients who are diagnosed at an early stage. Peripheral lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) is uncommon (less than 5% of patients), but abdominal lymphadenopathy is a relatively common finding on computed tomography scans.
The most important laboratory finding is the presence of hairy cells in the bloodstream. Hairy cells are abnormal white blood cells with hair-like projections of cytoplasm; they can be seen by examining a blood smear or bone marrow biopsy specimen. The blood film examination is done by staining the blood cells with Wright&#x27;s stain and looking at them under a microscope. Hairy cells are visible in this test in about 85% of cases. Along with the characteristic surface projections, hairy cells also have large amounts of cytoplasm, an oval (sometimes cleaved) nuclei with homogenous chromatin and no without distinct nucleoli giving the cells a &quot;fried egg&quot; appearance.

Most patients require a bone-marrow biopsy for final diagnosis. The bone marrow biopsy is used both to confirm the presence of HCL and also the absence of any additional diseases, such as Splenic marginal zone lymphoma or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The bone marrow in HCL may show a diffuse infiltration of leukemic cells or an interstitial infiltration with partial preservation of fat and hematopoietic stem cells. The diagnosis can be confirmed by viewing the cells with a special stain known as tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). More recently, DB44 testing assures more accurate results.

Definitively diagnosing HCL is also possible through flow cytometry on blood or bone marrow. The hairy cells are larger than normal and positive for CD19, CD20, CD22, CD11c, CD25, CD103, and FMC7 antigens. (CD103, CD22, and CD11c are strongly expressed.)

Annexin A1 and the BRAF v600E mutant protein are the most sensitive and specific cell markers associated with HCL. Diseases mimicking HCL are usually negative for both markers.

Hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V), which shares some characteristics with B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), does not show CD25 (also called the interleukin-2 receptor, alpha).

The differential diagnoses include several kinds of anemia, including myelophthisis and aplastic anemia, and most kinds of blood neoplasms, including hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome, atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, or idiopathic myelofibrosis.

===Classification===
The &quot;classic&quot; form is often implied, but hairy cell leukemia-variant has also been described.

====HCL-V====
Hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V) is usually described as a prolymphocytic variant of HCL. It was first described in 1980. About 10% of people with HCL have this variant form of the disease, representing about 60-75 new cases of HCL-V each year in the U.S. While classic HCL primarily affects men, HCL-V is more evenly divided between males and females. While the disease can appear at any age, the median age at diagnosis is over 70.

Similar to B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, HCL-V is a more aggressive disease. Historically, it has been considered less likely to be treated successfully than is classic HCL, and remissions have tended to be shorter. The introduction of combination therapy with concurrent rituximab and cladribine therapy, though, has shown excellent results in early follow-up. As of 2016, this therapy is considered the first-line treatment of choice for many people with HCL-V.

Many older treatment approaches, such as interferon-alpha, the combination chemotherapy regimen &quot;CHOP&quot;, and common alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, showed very little benefit. Pentostatin and cladribine administered as monotherapy (without concurrent rituximab) provide some benefit to many people with HCL-V, but typically induce shorter remission periods and lower response rates than when they are used in classic HCL. More than half of people respond partially to splenectomy.

HCL-V differs from classic HCL principally in these respects:
* Higher white blood cell counts, sometimes exceeding 100,000 cells per microliter
* A more aggressive course of disease requiring more frequent treatment
* Hairy cells with an unusually large nucleolus for their size
* Production of little excess fibronectin produced by classic hairy cells to interfere with bone marrow biopsies
* Low or no cell-surface expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 [IL-2] receptor alpha chain, or p55).

Low levels of CD25, a part of the receptor for a key immunoregulating hormone, may explain why HCL-V cases are generally much more resistant to treatment by immune-system hormones.

HCL-V, which usually features a high proportion of hairy cells without a functional &quot;p53&quot; tumor suppressor gene, is somewhat more likely to transform into a higher-grade malignancy. A typical transformation rate of 5-6% has been postulated in the UK, similar to the Richter&#x27;s transformation rate for splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) and CLL. Among HCL-V patients, the most aggressive cases normally have the least amount of p53 gene activity. Hairy cells without the &quot;p53&quot; gene tend, over time, to displace the less aggressive p53(+) hairy cells.

Some evidence suggests that a rearrangement of the immunoglobulin gene &quot;VH4-34&quot;, which is found in about 40% of HCL-V patients and 10% of classic HCL patients, may be a more important poor prognostic factor than variant status, with HCL-V patients without the VH4-34 rearrangement responding about as well as classic HCL patients.

==Treatment==
Several treatments are available, and successful control of the disease is common.
* Not everyone requires treatment immediately. Due to the indolent nature of HCL, a &quot;watchful waiting&quot; approach may be done for those without significant cytopenia (low hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count), symptomatic organomegaly, recurrent infections or constitutional symptoms. This watchful waiting approach is used in about 10-20% of people.

===First-line therapy===
Purine analogs such as cladribine and pentostatin are the first-line therapies for HCL. Purine analogs are very effective in the treatment of HCL, achieving remission rates of 80-90%; with remission being defined as normal or near normal blood counts, no palpable splenomegaly and no hairy cells on bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood without immunostaining, or minimal hairy cells with immunostaining (known as measurable residual disease). The benefits of treating measurable residual disease are not well established. The median relapse free time for purine analogs is greater than 10 years. The possible side effects of purine analogs include rash, fever, neutropenia, infections and a low T-cell counts (especially CD4+ T-cells). Purine analogs may cause immunosuppression over time and should not be used if the patients have an active infection.

Rituximab, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, may be added to purine analogs during initial treatment and is associated with increasing the remission rate to nearly 100%. Purine analogs may be less Purine analogs may be restarted in those with relapsed disease, with or without rituximab.

Cladribine can be administered by injection under the skin, by infusion over a few hours into a vein (intravenous - IV), or by a pump worn by the patient that provides a slow drip into a vein throughout the day. Most patients receive cladribine by IV infusion once a day for five to seven days, but more patients are being given the option of taking this drug once a week for six weeks. The different dosing schedules used with cladribine are roughly equally effective and safe. Relatively few patients have significant side effects other than fatigue and a high fever caused by the cancer cells dying, although complications such as infection and acute kidney failure have been seen. Pentostatin is chemically similar to cladribine, and has a similar success rate and side effect profile, but it is always given over a much longer period of time, usually one dose by IV infusion every two weeks for 3–6 months.

During the weeks following treatment, the patients&#x27; immune systems are severely weakened, but their bone marrow will begin to produce normal blood cells again. Treatment often results in long-term remission. If the cancer cells return, the treatment may be repeated and should again result in remission, although the treatment response may decline with repeated treatment.

Cladribine induced complete responses in patients with hairy cell leukemia resistant to pentostatin, suggesting a lack of cross-resistance..

===Second-line therapy===
If a patient is resistant to either cladribine or pentostatin, or in those with relapsed disease, then second-line therapy is pursued.
*BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib inhibit the MAPK/ERK pathway which is constitutively active in those with a BRAF V600E kinase activating mutation (which is 95% of those with HCL). Constitutively active MAPK kinase activity is what leads to disease activity in HCL by increasing cell survival, increasing proliferation and reducing apoptosis of the leukemic cells. BRAF inhibitors have an overall response rate of greater than 90% with a complete response of 30-35% in people with relapsed or refractory HCL. They are also known to have less toxic effects than the purine analogs. They may be combined with rituximab to increase the remission rate. The median duration of response with BRAF inhibitors is 1.5 years (more than 3 years if combined with rituximab), after which remission occurs. BRAF inhibitors with or without rituximab may be restarted if there is relapsed disease.
* Ritixumab: Two partial and 10 complete responses resulted from 15 patients with relapsed disease, for a total of 80% responding. The median response time is greater than 3 years. Rituximab has successfully induced a complete response in Hairy Cell-Variant.

Rituximab may cause a serum sickness reaction which presents with fevers, joint pain and rash approximately 4-10 days after any infusion. The reaction is successfully treated with steroids.
*If progression of disease or relapse is seen in those previously on BRAF inhibitors plus rituximab, the combination can be retried. Or the anti-CD22 immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox can be tried. Or a BRAF inhibitor can be restarted plus MEK inhibitors trametinib or cobimetinib.
* Interferon-alpha is an immune system hormone that is very helpful to a relatively small number of patients, and somewhat helpful to most patients. In about 65% of patients, the drug helps stabilize the disease or produce a slow, minor improvement for a partial response. Some patients can achieve the negativization of minimal residual disease by BRAF-V600E status 

Some patients tolerate IFN-alpha very well after the first few weeks, while others find that its characteristic flu-like symptoms persist. About 10% of patients develop a level of depression.

A drop in blood counts is usually seen during the first 1–2 months of treatment. Most patients find that their blood counts get worse for a few weeks immediately after starting treatment, although some patients find their blood counts begin to improve within just 2 weeks.

Typically, 6 months are needed to figure out whether this therapy is useful. Common criteria for treatment success include:
* Normalization of hemoglobin levels (above 12.0 g/dL),
* A normal or somewhat low platelet count (above 100 K/μL), and
* A normal or somewhat low absolute neutrophil count (above 1.5 K/μL).

IFN-alpha is considered the drug of choice for pregnant women with active HCL.

IFN-alpha works by sensitizing the hairy cells to the killing effect of the immune-system hormone TNF-alpha, whose production it promotes. IFN-alpha works best on classic hairy cells that are not protectively adhered to vitronectin or fibronectin, which suggests that patients who encounter less fibrous tissue in their bone-marrow biopsies may be more likely to respond to IFN-alpha therapy. It also explains why unadhered hairy cells, such as those in the bloodstream, disappear during IFN-alpha treatment well before reductions are seen in adhered hairy cells, such as those in the bone marrow and spleen.

===Other treatments===
Splenectomy (once commonly used in the treatment of HCL) has been replaced by purine analogs and other first line therapies, which are associated with greater response rates and a longer response. But splenectomy may still be done when other therapies fail and there is a large disease burden (clonal B cells) in the spleen.

People with low numbers of red blood cells or platelets may also receive red blood cells and platelets through blood transfusions. Affected people may also receive a hormone to stimulate production of red blood cells.

People with low neutrophil counts may be given filgrastim or a similar hormone to stimulate production of white blood cells. However, a 1999 study indicates that routine administration of this expensive injected drug has no practical value for HCL patients after cladribine administration. In this study, patients who received filgrastim were just as likely to experience a high fever and to be admitted to the hospital as those who did not, even though the drug elevated their white blood cell counts.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for HCL does not improve relapse free survival at 5 years and is associated with a high mortality rate above 15% and is not recommended.

==Prognosis==

===Treatment success===
More than 95% of new patients are treated well or at least adequately by cladribine or pentostatin. A majority of new patients can expect a disease-free remission time span of about ten years, or sometimes much longer after taking one of these drugs just once. If retreatment is necessary in the future, the drugs are normally effective again, although the average length of remission is somewhat shorter in subsequent treatments. There is also the risk of Shingles, and Peripheral Neuropathy after treatment with cladribine.

As with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mutations in the IGHV on hairy cells are associated with better responses to initial treatments and with prolonged survival.

How soon after treatment a patient feels &quot;normal&quot; again depends on several factors, including:
* how advanced the disease was at the time of treatment;
* the patient&#x27;s underlying health status;
* whether the patient had a &quot;complete response&quot; or only a partial response to the treatment;
* whether the patient experienced any of the rare, but serious side effects such as kidney failure;
* how aggressive the individual&#x27;s disease is;
* whether the patient is experiencing unusual psychological trauma from the &quot;cancer&quot; diagnosis; and
* how the patient perceived his or her pre-treatment energy level and daily functioning.

===Lifespan===
With appropriate treatment, the overall projected lifespan for patients is normal or near-normal. In all patients, the first two years after diagnosis have the highest risk for fatal outcome; generally, surviving five years predicts good control of the disease. After five years&#x27; clinical remission, patients in the United States with normal blood counts can often qualify for private life insurance with some US companies.

Accurately measuring survival for patients with the variant form of the disease (HCL-V) is complicated by the relatively high median age (70 years old) at diagnosis. However, HCL-V patients routinely survive for more than 10 years, and younger patients can likely expect a long life.

===Follow-up care===
Despite decade-long remissions and years of living very normal lives after treatment, hairy cell leukemia is officially considered an incurable disease. While survivors of solid tumors are commonly declared to be permanently cured after two, three, or five years, people who have hairy cell leukemia are never considered &#x27;cured&#x27;. Relapses of HCL have happened even after more than twenty years of continuous remission. Patients will require lifelong monitoring and should be aware that the disease can recur even after decades of good health.

While most oncologists consider Hairy Cell Leukemia to be incurable, there is some evidence that some patients are in fact cured after treatments. Of the original 358-patient cohort treated with cladribine at the Scripps Clinic, 9 of 19 in continuous CR for a median of 16 years were free of HCL — even sensitive testing for measurable or minimal residual disease (MRD) found an absence of hairy cells. This suggests that the disease of at least some patients may be cured.

People in remission need regular follow-up examinations after their treatment is over. Most physicians insist on seeing patients at least once a year for the rest of the patient&#x27;s life, and getting blood counts about twice a year. Regular follow-up care ensures that patients are carefully monitored, any changes in health are discussed, and new or recurrent cancer can be detected and treated as soon as possible. Between regularly scheduled appointments, people who have hairy cell leukemia should report any health problems, especially viral or bacterial infections, as soon as they appear.

HCL patients are also at a slightly higher than average risk for developing a second kind of cancer, such as colon cancer or lung cancer, at some point during their lives (including before their HCL diagnosis). This appears to relate best to the number of hairy cells, and not to different forms of treatment. On average, patients might reasonably expect to have as much as double the risk of developing another cancer, with a peak about two years after HCL diagnosis and falling steadily after that, assuming that the HCL was successfully treated. Aggressive surveillance and prevention efforts are generally warranted, although the lifetime odds of developing a second cancer after HCL diagnosis are still less than 50%.

There is also a higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease. Polyarteritis nodosa has been associated with underlying hairy cell leukemia in certain cases. Autoimmune diseases may also go into remission after treatment of HCL.

==Epidemiology==
HCL is more common in men, with the male to female distribution is 4 to 1, and the median age at diagnosis is age 55-60. It does not occur in children. The incidence in the United States and Europe is 0.28-0.3 cases per 100,000, and the prevalence is 3 cases per 100,000people in Europe. It is less common in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

It does not appear to be hereditary, although rare familial cases that suggest a predisposition have been reported, usually showing a common Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) type.

==Research directions==
The Hairy Cell Leukemia Consortium was founded in 2008 to address researchers&#x27; concerns about the long-term future of research on the disease.

In 2013 the Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation was created when the Hairy Cell Leukemia Consortium and the Hairy Cell Leukemia Research Foundation joined. The HCLF is dedicated to improving outcomes for patients and advancing research into HCL.

Three immunotoxin drugs have been studied in patients at the NIH National Cancer Institute in the U.S.: BL22, HA22 and LMB-2. All of these protein-based drugs combine part of an anti-B cell antibody with a bacterial toxin to kill the cells on internalization. BL22 and HA22 attack a common protein called CD22, which is present on hairy cells and healthy B cells. LMB-2 attacks a protein called CD25, which is not present in HCL-variant, so LMB-2 is only useful for patients with classic HCL. HA-22, now renamed moxetumomab pasudotox, is being studied in patients with relapsed hairy cell leukemia.

Other clinical trials are studying the effectiveness of cladribine followed by rituximab in eliminating residual hairy cells that remain after treatment by cladribine or pentostatin. It is not currently known if the elimination of such residual cells will result in more durable remissions.

The major remaining research questions are identifying the cause of HCL and determining what prevents hairy cells from maturing normally.

<text>Adson&#x27;s sign is the loss of the radial pulse in the arm by rotating head to the ipsilateral side with extended neck following deep inspiration.

It is sometimes used as a sign of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).
It is named after Alfred Washington Adson.

==Limitations, and pathophysiology of thoracic outlet syndrome==
Adson&#x27;s sign is no longer used as a positive diagnosis of TOS since many people without TOS will show a positive Adson&#x27;s.

There is minimal evidence of interexaminer reliability.

Thoracic outlet obstruction may be caused by a number of abnormalities, including degenerative or bony disorders, trauma to the cervical spine, fibromuscular bands, vascular abnormalities, and spasm of the anterior scalene muscle. Symptoms are due to compression of the brachial plexus and subclavian vasculature, and consist of complaints ranging from diffuse arm pain to a sensation of arm fatigue, frequently aggravated by carrying anything in the ipsilateral hand or doing overhead work such as window cleaning.

==Process==
* The patient is placed in a sitting position, hands resting on thighs.
* The examiner palpates radial pulse on side being tested
* Patient actively rotates head to ipsilateral side being tested while the examiner laterally rotates and extends the patient&#x27;s shoulder
* Patient takes a deep breath and is instructed to hold it

The test is positive if radicular symptoms are reported and secondary to a diminished or loss of the radial pulse.

<text>The town of Rota is a Spanish municipality located in the Province of Cádiz, Andalusia. Its surface area is 84 km2 and is bordered by the towns of Chipiona, Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María. It is located near the city of Jerez de la Frontera and is 36 kilometers away from the provincial capital, Cadiz. It had in the year 2009 28,516 inhabitants, with a density of 339 inhabitants / km2. It belongs to two associations, the Association of Municipalities of Cadiz Bay along with the municipalities of Cadiz, Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María, San Fernando, Chiclana and Puerto Real; and the Association of Municipalities of the Lower Guadalquivir that comprises municipalities of Northwest Coast of Andalusia.

Located along the Bay of Cádiz in the Atlantic Ocean, it is halfway between Portugal and Gibraltar, is predominantly a tourist town, a vacation/holiday destination for travelers from all over Europe. During the low season, its main business activity is the fishing industry. In the municipality is located the Naval Station Rota, which is the largest source of employment to the municipality. It also served as a transoceanic abort landing site for the Space Shuttle program.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence suggests that there was a Bronze Age settlement on the present site of Rota. The current town was founded by the Phoenicians at approximately the same time as Cádiz. Rota is assumed to be the same city known as &quot;Astaroth&quot; of the Tartesian empire. It later passed to the Romans, who knew the town as &quot;Speculum Rotae&quot;.

Following the arrival of the Moors in Spain, the city became known as &quot;Rabita Rutta&quot; (&quot;watchtower of Rota&quot;), from which it derives its present name. In 1217 the city was raided by a group of Frisian Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. From 1248 onwards, the Moors were gradually expelled from Spain, and the city became Christian. In 1297, Sancho IV awarded the town to Alonso Pérez de Guzmán in honour of his defence of Tarifa. Later, Pérez de Guzmán gave it to his daughter, Isabel, as a wedding present when she married Fermin Ponce de León, Maestre of Alcántara and First Lord of Marchena. Construction of the &quot;Castillo de la Luna&quot; (Castle of the Moon) had begun in 1295, two years prior to the bequest to Pérez de Guzmán, as part of Sancho IV&#x27;s effort to develop strong coastal defenses, especially near the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. During the Middle Ages, the town was an important port for trading with North Africa. In 1780 the 11th Duke of Arcos died without issue, and the city was rendered to the Duke of Osuna.

== Economy ==
Rota is primarily a resort town, offering eight hotels and nearly two thousand beds. It is a summer destination for tourists from all over Europe. During the off-season, its main commercial activity centres on the fishing industry.

Rota is also the location of the Rota naval base, a joint Spanish and U.S. naval base, opened in 1955 (which also hosts U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force units). It is also the usual first and last port of call for U.S. naval vessels after leaving the Mediterranean Sea. Once contributing up to 80 percent of Rota&#x27;s economy directly or indirectly, the significant decrease in the American presence since about 1995, and the city&#x27;s modern infrastructures that enable those remaining to commute readily from surrounding towns and cities, the base has given way to tourism as the leading source of revenue.

The surrounding area is used for agriculture; the predominant crops are cotton and sunflowers, as well as sweet green peppers, tomatoes, and pumpkins.

==Climate==

Rota has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild winters and hot summers. Rota has significant maritime influences from the Atlantic Ocean. The average temperature during the coldest month (January) is around while the average temperature during the hottest month (August) is around . Rota is very sunny, as the annual sunshine hours are above 3,000h. The average sea temperature is around during the winter and around during the summer.

==Demographics==

== Culinary ==
A traditional dish is the &quot;arranque&quot; made with chopped bread, tomatoes, green peppers, garlic, salt and olive oil. The local wine, known as &quot;tintilla&quot;, is made with dark, ripe grapes. It can be found in the numerous &quot;bodegas&quot; spread over the old town, one of them being &quot;El Gato&quot; which produces its own wine.

Spanish, Andalucian, Cádiz, and Rota gastronomic delights are many and varied. Most Spanish people enjoy dishes such as caracoles (snails), menudo (tripe soup), chicharrón (deep fried pork rinds), a variety of wines, and of course gazpacho (cold tomato soup taken as a drink).

== Arts ==
The Foundation Ruiz Mateos delivers a biannual award called Villa de Rota in the field of the plastic arts, music and literature. This constitutes nowadays an extensive art collection which is being shown in the Museum Ruiz Mateos since opened its doors on 4 February 2005. This museum gathers a total of 102 works composed of oil paintings, watercolors, engravings and sculptures, and includes all first prizes awarded in the course of the national contests “Villa de Rota” as well as individual donations received. Among other artists, Antonio Utrera, Francisco Luque and Dominika Grisgrabed have won the contest.

== Politics ==
Traditionally the town has four predominant parties: People&#x27;s Party, Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, United Left, and the local Roteños Unidos (United Rotanians). While there are occasional independent parties, the only one to successfully enter the Town Council is Roteños Unidos.

== Sports ==
Rota has two football (soccer) teams: CD Rota and UD Roteña, and also a basketball team: C.D. Don Bosco 88.

<text>Alexander&#x27;s law refers to gaze-evoked nystagmus that occurs after an acute unilateral vestibular loss. It was first described in 1912 and has three elements to explain how the vestibulo-ocular reflex responds to an acute vestibular insult. The first element says that spontaneous nystagmus after an acute vestibular impairment has the fast phase directed toward the healthy ear. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is named for the fast phase, so the spontaneous nystagmus is directed toward the healthy ear. The second element says nystagmus is greatest when gaze is directed toward the healthy ear, is attenuated at central gaze and may be absent when gaze is directed toward the impaired ear. The third element says that spontaneous nystagmus with central gaze is augmented when vision is denied. This became apparent with the implementation of electrographic testing.

Alexander&#x27;s law states that in individuals with nystagmus, the amplitude of the nystagmus increases when the eye moves in the direction of the fast phase (saccade).
It is manifested during spontaneous nystagmus in a patient with a vestibular lesion. The nystagmus becomes more intense when the patient looks in the quick-phase than in the slow-phase direction.

The law was named after Gustav Alexander who described it in 1912.

<text>Oregon Route 217 (OR 217), also known as the Beaverton-Tigard Highway 144, is a north-south controlled-access state highway in Washington County, Oregon. The route travels along the west suburbs of Portland, starting at US Route 26 (US 26) in Beaverton and ending at Interstate 5 (I-5) in Tigard.

OR 217 was initially a route on surface streets which ran from OR 8 in Beaverton and Wilsonville. Construction of the current freeway segment occurred from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, with the highway re-routed onto it afterwards. 

==Route description==
OR 217 begins at an interchange with US 26 and nearby Barnes Road near the St. Vincent Hospital. It then travels southwest before reaching Walker Road, after which it travels south towards Canyon Road (OR 8) and Beaverton Hillsdale Highway (OR 10), passing the Beaverton Town Center. Directly after the interchange, the highway turns southeasterly before turning back south right before the Denney Road interchange. 

The highway intersects Hall Boulevard near the Hall/Nimbus WES station and Scholls Ferry Road, and then proceeds to turn back southeast. The highway continues southeast for the rest of its route, after which it passes Greenburg Road and nearby Washington Square. The highway then intersects OR 99W and 72nd Avenue. After that, it enters an interchange with I-5, with southbound traffic continuing east towards Lake Oswego as Kruse Way.
For most of its length, OR 217 is a freeway with two travel lanes in each direction, with a third weave lane for exiting and merging, with the exception of its two termini. TriMet&#x27;s Westside Express Service, a commuter rail line, runs parallel to the highway between Tigard and Beaverton.

==History==

OR 217 originally ran along surface streets before it was relocated to freeway sections. The highway started at the junction of OR 8 and Hall Boulevard. in Beaverton, continuing along Hall Boulevard through Beaverton, Progress, Metzger, and Tigard for until it reached Durham Road. There, it took a left onto Durham Road, following it for about until the intersection with Boones Ferry Road. It remained on Boones Ferry Road through Durham, Tualatin, and Wilsonville for about , crossing the Willamette River on the Boones Ferry and continuing south for another until finally ending at OR 99E at Aurora, for a grand total of about or so. The southern terminus was scaled back to Wilsonville (current I-5 exit 286) with the completion of I-5 to Portland. This older highway, called the Beaverton-Aurora Highway, was kept in the state highway system as the Beaverton-Tualatin Highway No. 141, and was recently given the route designation OR 141.

The freeway carrying OR 217 was built in the mid-1960s to early 1970s in several stages, generally beginning at the south end. The full length of the freeway was repaved for the first time in the mid-1980s, along with the replacement of metal median barriers with concrete dividers. By 1985, approximately 60,000 to 68,000 vehicles used OR 217 daily. The intersection of OR 217 and US 26 in Beaverton was replaced with an interchange in 1986 after two years of construction.

== Future ==

ODOT started construction on the Auxiliary Lanes Project in December 2021, which aims to add a southbound auxiliary lane from exit 2A to exit 6 and a northbound auxiliary lane from exit 6 to exit 4. The Allen Boulevard southbound on-ramp and Denney Road southbound off-ramp will be removed for a new frontage road being constructed in place of it. The frontage road opened in November 2023.

<text>In cardiology, an Austin Flint murmur is a low-pitched rumbling heart murmur which is best heard at the cardiac apex. It can be a mid-diastolic or presystolic murmur. It is associated with severe aortic regurgitation, although the role of this sign in clinical practice has been questioned.

==Mechanism==
Echocardiography, conventional and colour flow Doppler ultrasound, and cine nuclear magnetic resonance (cine NMR) imaging suggest the murmur is the result of (aortic regurgitant) flow impingement on the inner surface of the heart, i.e. the endocardium.

===Classical description===
Classically, it is described as being the result of mitral valve leaflet displacement &quot;and&quot; turbulent mixing of anterograde mitral flow and retrograde aortic flow:

Displacement: The blood jets from the aortic regurgitation strike the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, which often results in premature closure of the mitral leaflets. This can be mistaken for mitral stenosis.

Turbulence of the two columns of blood: Blood from left atrium to left ventricle and blood from aorta to left ventricle.

==Name==
The Austin Flint murmur is named after the 19th century American physician, Austin Flint (1812–1886). He disapproved of associating any physical sign with the name of the original describer, and wrote, &quot;So long as signs are determined from fancied analogies, and named from these or after the person who describes them, there cannot but be obscurity and confusion.&quot;

<text>Bourgeois pseudoscience () was a term of condemnation in the Soviet Union for certain scientific disciplines that were deemed unacceptable from an ideological point of view due to their incompatibility with Marxism–Leninism. At various times pronounced &quot;bourgeois pseudosciences&quot; were: Mendelian genetics, cybernetics, quantum physics, theory of relativity, sociology and particular directions in comparative linguistics (the now-debunked Japhetic theory of Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr, which was also refuted by Stalin in &quot;Marxism and Problems of Linguistics&quot;).

The term was not used by Stalin himself, who rejected the notion that all sciences must have a class nature. Stalin removed all mention of “bourgeois biology” from Trofim Lysenko’s report, &quot;The State of Biology in the Soviet Union&quot;, and in the margin next to the statement that “&quot;any science is based on class&quot;” Stalin wrote, “&quot;Ha-ha-ha!! And what about mathematics? Or Darwinism?&quot;” The term or its synonyms was used in the 1951 and 1954 editions of the &quot;Short Philosophical Dictionary&quot;: &quot;Cybernetic is a reactionary pseudoscience originated in the United States... A form of modern mechanicism.&quot;, &quot;Eugenics is a bourgeois pseudoscience&quot;, &quot;Weismannism-Morganism - bourgeois pseudoscience, designed to justify capitalism&quot;. Today, most scholars agree in characterizing eugenics as rooted in pseudoscience, albeit without the &quot;bourgeois&quot; qualifier.

Psychology was declared a &quot;bourgeois pseudoscience&quot; in People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Furthermore, sociology was banned there in 1952, and it remained banned for until the late 1970s.

<text>Bouchard&#x27;s nodes are hard, bony outgrowths or gelatinous cysts on the proximal interphalangeal joints (the middle joints of fingers or toes). They are seen in osteoarthritis, where they are caused by the formation of calcific spurs of the articular (joint) cartilage. Much less commonly, they may be seen in rheumatoid arthritis, where nodes are caused by antibody deposition to the synovium.

Bouchard&#x27;s nodes are comparable in presentation to Heberden&#x27;s nodes, which are similar osteoarthritic growths on the distal interphalangeal joints, but are significantly less common.

==Eponym==
Bouchard&#x27;s nodes are named after French pathologist Charles Jacques Bouchard (1837–1915).

<doc id="1094668" wikidata="Q734008" url="?curid=1094668" title="Asoka (2001 film)">
<text>As̅oka is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language epic historical drama film directed and co-written by Santosh Sivan. It is a dramatized version of the early life of emperor Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire, who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan as the titular character alongside Kareena Kapoor, Rahul Dev, Danny Denzongpa, Hrishitaa Bhatt with Ajith Kumar in a special appearance. It was produced by Gauri Khan, Juhi Chawla and Radhika Sangoi. The screenplay was written by Santosh Sivan and Saket Chaudhary and the dialogue by Abbas Tyrewala. It was originally released as &quot;Ashoka: The Great&quot; in India.

&quot;Asoka&quot; was widely screened across the United Kingdom and North America, and was also selected for screening at the Venice Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, where it received positive reviews. It was also dubbed into Tamil.

At the 47th Filmfare Awards, &quot;Asoka&quot; received 5 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Sivan) and Best Actress (Kapoor), and won Best Cinematography (Sivan). This is also the penultimate production venture of Dreamz Unlimited.

==Plot==

The film chronicles the early part of the life of Emperor Asoka. It begins with his career as a general in Takshashila and ends with the bloody conquest of the Kalinga.

Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, grandfather of Asoka, of the Maurya empire, has decided to embrace Jainism and abdicate the throne of the empire in favour of his son Bindusara. But his grandson, prince Asoka, claims his sword. The old emperor explains that this sword is evil, and the sword demands blood and destruction.

A few years later, prince Asoka, now a brave youth, is battling the rebellious chief of Takshashila for his emperor/father. He figures that his elder half-brother Susima Maurya, who also has an eye on the throne of the empire, has deliberately withheld reinforcements from arriving, but defeats the enemy nevertheless. Asoka returns to the capital victorious and confronts Susima. Later, Susima tries to assassinate Asoka while he is bathing. The fight among the princes makes the emperor unhappy, and he orders empress Dharma to control her son Asoka. She compels Asoka to temporarily leave the capital to lead the life of a common person. The prince is disappointed but leaves nonetheless.

Asoka, alone and disguised as an ordinary traveller, rides to the south. In his travels, he meets a lovely maiden, Kaurwaki and falls in love with her. He also develops a good relationship with her little brother Arya. They are on the run from the Kingdom of Kalinga along with their faithful protector Bheema and are being chased by soldiers of the kingdom. After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan, hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the princess and prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the prime minister assassinated their parents and took over power. Later, Asoka and Kaurwaki get secretly married.

Soon, Asoka is summoned by his mother, who sent a messenger to tell him she has fallen ill and to come to the capital. The emperor dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in Ujjaini. Before marching to the west, Asoka travels to Kalinga to meet Kaurwaki and Arya. Unable to find them, and not knowing they have gone into hiding, he is informed by general Bheema that they were slaughtered. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide but is saved by Virat, who later swears to protect him. Mad with grief and anger, Asoka leads a brutal crackdown in Ujjaini. The assassins sent by Susima injure Asoka in a battle, and Virat saves him. He is taken to a Buddhist monastery at Vidisa to recover.

There, he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi, who cares for him. Asoka also survives another assassination attempt at Vidisa, this time with the help of Devi. Asoka marries Devi and returns in splendour to Pataliputra. Susima and his brothers are wild with anger from their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. Emperor Bindusara, who favoured Susima over Asoka, becomes ill and dies. In another vigilante attack, empress Dharma is stabbed to death by assassins sent by Susima. Angered, Asoka wants to kill Susima but has second thoughts, and Susima is killed by Virat when he tries to kill Asoka behind his back and is appointed emperor.

A few months later, princess Kaurwaki and prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and have the prime minister executed for treason. Asoka declares war on Kalinga, not knowing that Kaurwaki is alive. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and both sides prepare for war.

A terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Mauryan Army inflicts a crushing defeat on Kalinga. Not content with the mere victory, Mauryan soldiers butcher everyone in sight. General Bheema is killed after failing to assassinate Asoka realizing that he is Pawan and Kaurwaki is wounded. Asoka later visits the battlefield, where he discovers his horse, who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki&#x27;s possession. With a surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki and finds her. They have a heart-to-heart talk, and he apologises deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being pierced with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realises that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead because of him. His grandfather&#x27;s warning about the sword had been correct.

The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword into the water at the same spot as his grandfather, and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace throughout the empire.

==Cast==
As per the film&#x27;s opening credits:
==Production==
&quot;I was dancing in a train for a song in a movie (&quot;Chaiyya Chaiyya&quot; on the sets of Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Dil Se..&quot;) that Santosh Sivan was lensing, and he came up to me between shots and told me about Asoka,&quot; says Shah Rukh Khan. &quot;I could only understand half of what he said but I could see the determination in his eyes, and that, somehow or other, he would make it with or without me. That&#x27;s 80% of the battle won. I was hooked.&quot;

The director, along with the principal costume designer Anu Vardhan, started working on the project two years before they started the actual shooting of the film. Though Vardhan agrees that there was no concept of wearing vests during that era, certain cinematic liberties had been taken because Shahrukh did not wanted to shoot shirtless throughout the film. &quot;After all, it is a mainstream commercial film. During Shah Rukh&#x27;s forest sequences, he wears square pieces of a blanket-like-material, folded into two and cut in between, to pass around the neck. Another piece of cloth was tried around his waist, acting as a belt. There was no stitching involved.&quot; Anu explains, &quot;While researching for the film, we discovered that body art was a prominent part of that time. For the character of Kaurwaki (Kareena), we used different designs of tattoos.&quot; The armours and shields are worn by the artistes also form an important part of the costume for the final war sequences. Metal jackets composed of special fibre glass were made for around 4000 members of the cast. &quot;These metal jackets are extremely light and comfortable and were made in Madras by more than 50 workers,&quot; she explains.

&quot;I also tried to give the different parts of the film different looks: for example when the viewer is taken to Magadha (Bihar), the temples and houses have been made using black granite while when we are in Kalinga (Orissa) I have used brown sandstone and earth tones to generate a different feel. Also I worked with only six pillars in the film, it is hard to imagine that once you see the film&quot;, said Sabu Cyril.

The film was shot at various locations, such as Pachmarhi (the bulk of the romance between Asoka and the princess), Maheshwar (the palace intrigues of Pataliputra), Madhya Pradesh, Jaipur (battle scenes), Igatpuri and Bhubaneswar (the Kalinga portions). More than half the film was shot indoors on the studio floors of Film City and Filmistan. The elaborate final battle scene (the battle fought against the Kalingas) employed over six thousand extras and hundreds of elephants. Some of the actors portraying warriors in the film were masters of Kalari, who used their expertise. They were the only ones to use real weapons in the filming. The song &quot;Raat Ka Nasha&quot; was picturised at Bhedaghat and Panchmarhi in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh amidst the Narmada River.

The film is also known for using minimal special effects. While &quot;Lagaan&quot; was made at considerable expense, &quot;Asoka&quot; had only a moderate budget. Sivan says he didn&#x27;t want any special effects, and no digitally augmented crowds. Priyanka Chopra turned down the offer to appear in a song in the film.

==Soundtrack==
The songs of the movie were composed by Anu Malik. Initially, A. R. Rahman was signed in to compose the film&#x27;s music, but for reasons unknown, he opted out. Malik stepped in to compose the songs, while Sandeep Chowta was brought on board for the background score. Gulzar wrote the lyrics for five songs, while one song was written by Anand Bakshi (&quot;San Sanana&quot;). The soundtrack was very successful and according to the Indian trade website &quot;Box Office India&quot;, with around 1,500,000 units sold, the album was one of the year&#x27;s the highest-selling.

==Reception==

===Box office===
====India====
It opened on 26 October 2001, across 235 screens, and earned nett on its opening day. It grossed nett in its opening weekend, and had a first week of nett. The film earned a total of nett. It was the 13th-highest-grossing film of 2001 in India.

====International====
It had an opening weekend of $800,000 (3.84 crore) and went on to gross $1.07 million (5.13 crore) in its first week. The film earned a total of $1.8 million (8.64 crore) at the end of its theatrical run. Overseas, it was the 4th-highest-grossing Indian film of 2001.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Asoka&quot; was critically acclaimed upon release. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;a big, brash and deeply enjoyable Bollywood epic&quot;. He stated, &quot;This movie&#x27;s narrative gusto, its intricate, indirect eroticism – no sex, or even kissing – its lavish musical numbers and its sheer self-belief are a treat.&quot;

Neil Smith described the film; &quot;with elements of both &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) and &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), &quot;Asoka&quot; is a big, sprawling epic that looks every rupee it took to bring it to the screen.&quot; However, &quot;BBC&quot;″s Santosh Sinha noted, &quot;It is at this point in the film [when the prince go into hiding as per the request of the mother Queen] that Asoka is temporarily lost and Shahrukh Khan the actor takes over. He meets Princess Kaurwaki in the forest and then chases her around in a typically Bollywood way. He [Khan] is also less convincing when, grieved by the loss of life in Kalinga, he renounces violence and vows to spread the message of peace far and wide. This comes across as melodramatic. Bollywood style, Asoka finds Kaurwaki and the young Prince Arya of Kalinga on the battlefield. Prince Arya manages a dying speech before he keels over and that breaks Asoka completely.&quot; Journalist, editor and film trade analyst Taran Adarsh wrote that &quot;director Santosh Sivan has chosen a historical subject, but added his spice and come up with a fairytale kind of a flick. As a cinematographer, Santosh Sivan&#x27;s work is flawless.&quot;

The portrayal of Asoka in the film proved controversial in India. &quot;Shahrukh&#x27;s Asoka is all bluster and mannerism, with no depth. Except for the nosebleeds and the mudbaths, he is the same Shahrukh of every other movie that he has acted in. The film leaves its many complex moments unexplored and disjointed, choosing to pitch it as a love story instead of an epic tale of war and peace,&quot; an Indian reviewer wrote.

&quot;Variety&quot;″s David Rooney states, &quot;a sprawling widescreen historical epic laced with Bollywood musical numbers, melodramatic romance, spectacular locations and violent battle scenes. Coming on the heels of Ashutosh Gowariker&#x27;s &quot;Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India&quot;, &quot;Asoka&quot; provides further evidence that Bollywood is poised for wider commercial impact beyond its already substantial established niche. And while the ambling, uneconomical nature of popular Indian storytelling makes major crossover business unlikely in this case, some degree of general art-house attention appears indicated. Khan cuts a dashing figure as a soulful hunk in the traditional Bollywood mould. At the same time, Kapoor plays ornately tattooed Kaurwaki as a lively mix of flirtatious coquette and feisty warrior woman, kind of like Jennifer Lopez meets Michelle Yeoh.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; praised the movie gave it 4 out of 5 stars. It states,&quot;Santosh Sivan may just be the man who provides that elusive Indian crossover hit with this rip-roaring historical adventure. The fact that Asoka was such a bloody warrior is no more ably demonstrated than when the battle scenes kick in near the end, it&#x27;s like Akira Kurosawa goes Bollywood.&quot;

Critics generally praised the cinematography of Santosh Sivan.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;Asoka had embraced Buddhism long after the Kaling War, and yet, as far as historical accuracy is concerned, there&#x27;s a surprising result: though the whole Pawan/Kaurwaki episode is fantasy, the film mostly avoids messing around with the known facts&quot;, wrote historian Alex von Tunzelmann. There is also no historical evidence of a queen ruling Kalinga at the time of Asoka&#x27;s invasion. The film also does not depict Ashoka&#x27;s love for Devi. The film also explicitly suggests that Kalinga was a democracy.

==Miniseries==
StarPlus launched an extended miniseries version of the film, split into five episodes. It aired from 28 May 2002 to 25 June 2002.

<doc id="1094670" wikidata="Q7993737" url="?curid=1094670" title="Whipple's triad">
<text>Whipple&#x27;s triad is a collection of three signs (called Whipple&#x27;s criteria) that suggests that a patient&#x27;s symptoms result from hypoglycaemia that may indicate insulinoma. The essential conditions are symptoms of hypoglycaemia, low blood plasma glucose concentration, and relief of symptoms when plasma glucose concentration is increased. It was first described by the pancreatic surgeon Allen Whipple, who aimed to establish criteria for exploratory pancreatic surgery to look for insulinoma.

== Definition ==
Whipple&#x27;s triad is stated in various versions. The essential conditions are:
# Symptoms known or likely to be caused by hypoglycaemia, especially after fasting or intense exercise. These symptoms include tremor, tachycardia, anxiety, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.
# A low blood plasma glucose concentration measured at the time of the symptoms. This may be measured as a blood plasma glucose concentration of less than 550 milligrams per litre.
# Relief of symptoms when glucose level is increased.
The use and significance of the criteria have evolved over the last century as understanding of the many forms of hypoglycaemia has increased and diagnostic tests and imaging procedures have improved. Whipple&#x27;s criteria are no longer used to justify surgical exploration for an insulinoma, but to separate &quot;true hypoglycaemia&quot; (in which a low glucose can be demonstrated) from a variety of other conditions (e.g., idiopathic postprandial syndrome) in which symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia occur, but low glucose levels cannot be demonstrated. The criteria are now invoked far more often by endocrinologists than by surgeons. The radiological investigation of choice now is endoscopic and/or intraoperative ultrasonography.

== Differential diagnosis ==
Whipple&#x27;s triad is not exclusive for insulinoma, and other conditions will also be considered. The same signs may be caused by hyperinsulinism not caused by insulinoma.

==History==
The criteria date back to the 1930s, when a few patients with hypoglycaemic symptoms (such as shakiness, syncope, or sweating) due to hypoglycaemia were found to be cured by surgery to remove an insulinoma, but a large proportion of people with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia apparently had no need of surgery. Diagnostic testing was rudimentary; beyond a crude assay for reducing substances as an indirect measure of blood glucose, no way had yet been found to measure hormones and metabolites such as insulin, with no imaging procedures for internal organs such as the pancreas.

Allen Whipple was a well-known surgeon who had pioneered pancreatic surgery. He proposed that no pancreatic surgery to look for insulinoma be performed unless these criteria were met. For this reason, Whipple&#x27;s triad is also known as Whipple&#x27;s criteria.

<text>Carrington V.C., also known as Court Martial in the United States, is a 1954 British legal drama film directed by Anthony Asquith and starring David Niven, Margaret Leighton and Noelle Middleton. Others in the cast include Allan Cuthbertson, Victor Maddern, Raymond Francis, Michael Bates, Laurence Naismith, Geoffrey Keen and Maurice Denham. Made by Romulus Films it was distributed by the company&#x27;s Independent Film Distributors and released in the United States by Kingsley-International Pictures. It was adapted for the screen by John Hunter from the play of the same name by Campbell and Dorothy Christie. It was produced by Teddy Baird.

It was shot at Shepperton Studios near London with sets designed by the art director Wilfred Shingleton. The Victoria Cross worn by Niven in the film was that awarded to Arthur Henry Cross for service in World War I.

==Plot==

Major Charles &#x27;Copper&#x27; Carrington VC is arrested for embezzling £125 from his unit&#x27;s safe. Other charges include going absent without leave from the base, and entertaining a woman officer in his room.

Defending himself at his court-martial, Carrington&#x27;s case is that he had told his superior, Colonel Henniker, that he would take the money to advertise his complaint that he was owed for expenses. He transferred £100 of it to his wife, Valerie, who was suicidal from financial worries, and left the base to compete in a horse race in which he bet the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham tried to replace the money, but was denied access to the safe.

While bed-ridden from the fall, Carrington was visited by Graham to discuss the embezzlement. She was sitting in a chair fully dressed when Colonel Henniker stormed in, saying it was against regulations for males and females to be together in private quarters. He admits to having waited for some time after seeing Graham go to Carrington&#x27;s room before following.

Henniker resents Carrington. Carrington could be cleared if it is established that he had forewarned Henniker of his intentions. Henniker perjures himself by denying it.

Due to her ill-health, Carrington had not intended to call Valerie as a witness, but does so after Henniker&#x27;s testimony.

Before Valerie&#x27;s appearance, Graham admits to her that she had a one-night stand with Carrington, but that Carrington then insisted that a full affair would not be fair to anyone.

Valerie perjures herself by denying Carrington had mentioned telling Colonel Henniker he planned to take the money. Carrington is about to read extracts from a letter she wrote to him in which she refers to his informing Henniker, when the judge insists the entire letter be examined to be accepted into evidence. As the letter also contains personal matters about Valerie&#x27;s health, Carrington tears it up.

Carrington is found guilty on all counts, which means dismissal from the service subject to the verdict&#x27;s confirmation.

Carrington decides not to appeal the verdict, and his marriage is also over.

Gossiping about the case, a telephonist reveals that she overheard Carrington&#x27;s phone call with his wife in which he said what he had told Henniker. Her colleague brings her to the court martial panel to give her evidence.

<doc id="1094676" wikidata="Q465830" url="?curid=1094676" title="Sharmila Tagore">
<text>Sharmila Tagore (; born 8 December 1944) also known by her married name Begum Ayesha Sultana, is an Indian actress primarily known for her work in Hindi and Bengali films. Regarded among the greatest actresses in the history of Indian cinema, she is known for portraying both traditional and modern women. Tagore is a recipient of two National Film Awards, a Filmfare Award and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2013, the Government of India, honoured her with Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s third highest civilian honour for her contributions to Indian culture through performing arts.

Born into the prominent Tagore family, one of the leading families of Calcutta and a key influence during the Bengali Renaissance, Tagore made her acting debut at age 14 with Satyajit Ray&#x27;s acclaimed Bengali epic drama &quot;The World of Apu&quot; (1959). She went on to collaborate with Ray on numerous other films, including &quot;Devi&quot; (1960), &quot;Nayak&quot; (1966), &quot;Aranyer Din Ratri&quot; (1970), and &quot;Seemabaddha&quot; (1971); thus establishing herself as one of the most prominent figures in Bengali cinema.

Tagore&#x27;s career further expanded when she ventured into Hindi films with Shakti Samanta&#x27;s romance &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot; (1964). She established herself as one of the leading actresses of Hindi cinema with films like &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), &quot;Anupama&quot; (1966), &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot; (1967), &quot;Aamne Saamne&quot; (1967), &quot;Satyakam&quot; (1969), &quot;Aradhana&quot; (1969), &quot;Safar&quot; (1970), &quot;Amar Prem&quot; (1972), &quot;Daag&quot; (1973), &quot;Avishkaar&quot; (1974), &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot; (1975), &quot;Mausam&quot; (1975), and &quot;Namkeen&quot; (1982). She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for &quot;Aradhana&quot; and the National Film Award for Best Actress for &quot;Mausam&quot;. This was followed by intermittent film appearances in the subsequent decades, including in Mira Nair&#x27;s &quot;Mississippi Masala&quot; (1991) and Goutam Ghose&#x27;s &quot;Abar Aranye&quot; (2002), which won her the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and in the Hindi films &quot;Aashik Awara&quot; (1993), &quot;Mann&quot; (1999), &quot;Viruddh&quot; (2005), &quot;&quot; (2007) and &quot;Break Ke Baad&quot; (2010). Following a hiatus of 13 years, she made her film comeback with the drama &quot;Gulmohar&quot; (2023).

Apart from acting, Tagore has also served as the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification from October 2004 to March 2011. In December 2005, she was chosen as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She was married to cricketer and the Nawab of Pataudi, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, with whom she had three children—actors Saif and Soha, and jewellery designer Saba.

== Early life and background ==
Sharmila Tagore was born on 8 December 1944 in Cawnpore (now Kanpur), United Provinces to Gitindranath Tagore, a general manager in the British India Corporation, and his wife Ira Tagore (née Barua). Tagore&#x27;s father belonged to the aristocratic Bengali Hindu Brahmin Tagore family, and was related to the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Her mother was of Assamese descent and hailed from the Barua family. Gitindranath was the grandson of the noted painter Gaganendranath Tagore, whose own father Gunendranath had been a first cousin of the laureate. In fact, Tagore is more closely related to Rabindranath Tagore through her mother: her maternal grandmother, Latika Barua (née Tagore), was the granddaughter of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s brother, Dwijendranath Tagore. Tagore&#x27;s maternal grandfather (husband of Latika Barua née Tagore) was Jnanadabhiram Barua, an Assamese Freedom Fighter and Writer who was the First Principal of Earl Law College in Guwahati (now known as Government Law College), himself the son of the noted social worker Gunabhiram Barua. As a member of the Tagore family, she is also a distant relative of the actress Devika Rani and the painter Abanindranath Tagore (brother of Gaganendranath Tagore).

Tagore was the eldest of three daughters and had two younger sisters, the late Oindrila Kunda [Tinku Tagore] and Romila Sen [Chinky]. Oindrila was the first in the family to act in a film, and the only role she ever played was that of &quot;Mini&quot;, the child character (but a central character) in Tapan Sinha&#x27;s film &quot;Kabuliwala&quot; (1957). In adulthood, she became an international bridge player. Her other sister, Romila Sen, married to Nikhil Sen, a businessman who served as chief operating officer of Britannia Industries for several years, died as the founder and managing director of Unibic Foods in November 2019.

Tagore attended St. John&#x27;s Diocesan Girls&#x27; Higher Secondary School and Loreto Convent, Asansol. She made her film debut when she was a 13-year-old schoolgirl, after which her studies lost priority. Within a short while, her attendance and performance at school suffered, she came to be regarded as a bad influence on her classmates, and was faced with a choice of either doing films or studying further. At that point, her father advised her to move ahead in life, commit herself to a film career and &#x27;give it her all&#x27; in order to become successful.

== Career ==
=== Early work and breakthrough (1959–1968) ===
Tagore began her career as an actress in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s Bengali epic drama &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (1959), as an ill-fated bride. In 1960, Ray cast her again in &quot;Devi&quot;, a film set in 1860 on Hindu orthodoxy and rational reforms, which she considers her favourite film and performance. She went onto appear in Bengali films &quot;Shes Anko&quot; and &quot;Nirjan Saikate&quot;, winning the IFFI Best Actor Award (Female) for the latter, alongside Chhaya Devi, Ruma Guha Thakurta, Renuka Devi and Bharati Devi.

Tagore made her Hindi film debut with Shakti Samanta&#x27;s musical romance &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot; (1964) alongside Shammi Kapoor. She and Samanta collaborated on several of his later films, including the romantic thriller &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot; (1967) again opposite Kapoor. With the film, she became the first Indian actress to appear in a swimsuit, which established Tagore as a sex symbol in Hindi films. While the scene in the film is often referred to as &#x27;the bikini scene&#x27;, Tagore&#x27;s swimwear is actually a one piece. However, she did pose in a bikini for the cover of &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine in 1966. But, when she was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification 36 years later, she expressed concerns about the increased use of bikinis in Indian films.

Tagore went on to appear in films such as the Hindi films &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), &quot;Anupama&quot; (1966), &quot;Devar&quot; (1966), &quot;Aamne Saamne&quot; (1967), &quot;Mere Hamdam Mere Dost&quot; (1968), and the Bengali film &quot;Nayak&quot; (1966). Her performance in &quot;Anupama&quot;, opposite Dharmendra, proved to be her breakthrough.

All these films established her as one of the leading actresses of the time, in addition to establishing the Tagore-Khanna pair as one of the greatest best on-screen pairs of Indian cinema. &quot;Aradhana&quot;, &quot;Safar&quot; and &quot;Amar Prem&quot; earned Tagore nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, winning the award for the former.

Tagore&#x27;s other films during this period included &quot;Ek Se Badhkar Ek&quot; (1976), &quot;Tyaag&quot; (1977), which she also co-produced, and the Malayalam film &quot;Chuvanna Chirakukal&quot; (1978) among others.

=== Further success and sporadic work (1981–2006) ===
In the 1980s, Tagore appeared in films such as &quot;Kalankini Kankabati&quot; (1981), &quot;Namkeen&quot; (1982), &quot;New Delhi Times&quot; (1986) and &quot;Maa Beti&quot; (1986). She reunited with frequent co-star Dharmendra in the action film &quot;Sunny&quot; (1984), which starred Dharmendra&#x27;s son Sunny Deol in the lead role. Her performance in the film earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Tagore starred alongside her son Saif Ali Khan in his debut film &quot;Aashik Awara&quot; (1993) and the action drama &quot;&quot; (2007), receiving critical praise for the latter.

She also appeared in supporting roles in the musical romantic drama &quot;Dhadkan&quot; (2000) and the drama &quot;Abar Aranye&quot; (2003), the latter of which earned her the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Tagore received high critical acclaim for her performance in the family drama &quot;Virruddh... Family Comes First&quot; (2005) alongside frequent co-star Bachchan, earning her fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

The film earned her critical acclaim, with the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noting that, &quot;The elegance and poise Tagore exudes are remarkable.

== Reception and legacy ==
Tagore is considered among the finest actresses of Indian cinema. She is highly regarded for her range as an actor, her beauty, and her fashion sense and style. She was known for her range of portrayals – from traditional to modern women. Tagore portrayed challenging roles such as that of — a journalist in &quot;Nayak&quot;, a club dancer in &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot;,a widow in &quot;Aradhana&quot;,a surgeon in &quot;Safar&quot;, a woman disowned by her husband in &quot;Amar Prem&quot;, a teacher and victim of abuse in &quot;Daag&quot; and a prostitute in &quot;Mausam&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; added her performances in &quot;Mausam&quot; in its list of Bollywood&#x27;s &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot;, placing it at the 59th place.

<doc id="1094681" wikidata="Q1680460" url="?curid=1094681" title="James Gladstone">
<text>James Gladstone (; May 21, 1887 – September 4, 1971) was a Canadian politician who claimed to become the first Treaty Indian to be appointed to the Senate of Canada.

== Early life ==
James Gladstone was of mixed racial ancestry. The future senator was not born First Nations and only became a status Indian at the age of 33, when in 1920 his wife&#x27;s family petitioned the government for his inclusion on the Indian registry. His maternal grandfather, in fact, was a Scottish-Canadian, born in Montreal in 1832, who entered the service of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at the age of sixteen. While in the North-West Territories, William Shanks Gladstone married Harriet Leblanc, a Métis of Cree, Santee Sioux, and French Canadian heritage. One of their six children who survived to adulthood was Harriet (named after her mother), who was born at Rocky Mountain House in 1859. Harriet led a rough and unsteady life. After several years spent with a rough crowd of Métis and white frontiersmen, she formed a long-term relationship with a white lumber-mill foreman. Their union broke down, however, in the mid-1890s, and Harriet was left to raise skinny Jimmy, a boy with brown hair and blue eyes on her own. He was one of four children born to Harriet.

He attended St. Paul&#x27;s Indian Residential School, because his Grandfather and local Anglican minister felt he would be fed, clothed, educated and spiritually looked after. He attended an Anglican mission school on the Blood reserve until 1903, when he moved to an Indian Industrial school (St Dunstans) in Calgary and apprenticed as a printer, interning at &quot;The Calgary Herald&quot;.

== Career ==
After leaving school in 1905, Gladstone returned to the Blood reserve where he worked as an interpreter. He also found work on ranches wrangling cattle. In 1911, he found work with the Royal North-West Mounted Police as a scout and interpreter and also worked as a mail carrier on the reserve. He is also reported as being a typesetter at one time at the Calgary Herald.

He was married to Blood member Janie Healy. After his marriage he was registered a member of the Blood reserve. Eventually, Gladstone established himself as a farmer and successful rancher (with 720 acres under cultivation and a herd of 400 Hereford cattle in 1958) and worked with his sons to assemble the 400 head of cattle and introducing modern farming practices to the reserve, including first use of a tractor in 1920.

In 1949, Gladstone was elected president of the Indian Association of Alberta though another source records his presidency as 1945–1954, and was sent to Ottawa three times to press for improvements to the Indian Act. His acceptance by both Blackfoot and Cree assisted him in bringing the different groups together in one political organization.

== Senate appointment ==
He was nominated to the Senate by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in January 1958, at age 70, two years before status Indians gained the vote in federal elections, and he pressed for Aboriginals to be enfranchised. He sat as an &quot;independent Conservative&quot; &quot;representing 160,000 Indians across the land.&quot; He advocated for integration into Canadian society. He was the chair of the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs. To meet the property qualifications for the Senate &quot;he drove with his wife to nearby Cardston and paid cash for a five-room bungalow.&quot;

== Retirement and death ==
Gladstone retired from the Senate in March 1971 and died of a heart attack on September 4, 1971, in Fernie, British Columbia.

== Posthumous recognition ==
A biography of Senator Jim Gladstone, written by Alberta historian (and Gladstone&#x27;s son-in-law) Hugh Dempsey, is entitled &quot;The Gentle Persuader&quot;.

In 2017, the Bank of Canada unveiled a commemorative Canadian ten-dollar note in honour of Canada 150, featuring Gladstone&#x27;s portrait alongside Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Étienne Cartier, and Agnes Macphail.

<text>Clifton is a village on the eastern outskirts of Brighouse in the Calderdale district of West Yorkshire, England.

==History==
Clifton is mentioned as &quot;Cliftone&quot; in the Domesday book The entry reads ‘In Cliftone Escelf has seven carucates of land…where four ploughs may be…’The manor was one of two hundred manors granted by William the Conqueror to the Norman noble, Ilbert de Laci. The early Lords of the Manor lived at Clifton Hall (which was down Well Lane) and Cross Hall (later called Highley Hall). Remnants of the early ‘strip’ farming remain in the fields known as ‘The Acres’.

Clifton was historically a chapelry in the ancient parish of Dewsbury. It became a separate civil parish in 1866. From 1837 it formed part of the Halifax Poor Law Union and therefore became part of the Halifax Rural District when it was created in 1894. The parish of Clifton was abolished in 1937. Most of the parish, including the village itself, was added to the parish and Municipal Borough of Brighouse. Smaller areas were transferred to the parishes of Cleckheaton and Liversedge in the urban district of Spenborough. The borough of Brighouse was abolished in 1974, becoming part of Calderdale. No successor parish was created for the former borough and so Clifton is directly administered by Calderdale Council.

==Governance==
Clifton is a village in the Brighouse ward of Calderdale, a metropolitan borough in the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire, England.

==Geography==
The village is on the north side of the valley of the River Calder and the plateau adjoining it.

The village is on the route of the Calderdale Way. This is a 50-mile circular walk around the hills and valleys of Calderdale.

===Nearby towns and villages===
==Culture and community==

There are two public houses at either end of the main street (Towngate). One, the Black Horse Inn, was the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; pub restaurant of 2006. The other is the Armytage Arms. Clifton also has a small hairdressing salon.

The Clifton Village Community Association (CVCA) organises local events, in recent years has added a new memorial stone to men lost in WWII associated with Clifton Village war memorial railings and the village play park. In addition to restoring and managing the former telephone kiosk, the CVCA has oversight of local issues.

The Clifton Village Neighbourhood Forum (CVNF) was granted recognition by Calderdale Council on 1 August 2018 to produce a neighbourhood plan for Clifton Village.

Clifton also gives its name to the Clifton &amp; Lightcliffe brass band. It is one of the country&#x27;s oldest, formed in 1838. The band headquarters is in nearby Bailiff Bridge.

==Landmarks==
There are many local historical references connected to drift mining. It was first recorded in 1307 and also mentioned by Daniel Defoe, author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, in his 1727 book &#x27;A Tour Of Great Brittain&#x27;. On the western flank of the village is a long straight ridge, which constitutes the remains of a gravity railway that was last used to transport coal in 1920 to the municipal gasworks by the Calder and Hebble Navigation at Brighouse.

There are also intriguing historical connections such as America Lane, the fever hospital and Clifton &#x27;airport&#x27; used by Sir Alan Cobham&#x27;s Air Circus between the two world wars. The remains of the village well can be seen opposite the school.

At the easterly edge of the village is the 16th-century Kirklees Hall, whose grounds contain the reputed grave of Robin Hood. It was the model for &#x27;Nunwood&#x27; in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &#x27;Shirley&#x27;. At the northerly end of the village, there remains evidence of strip farming, also known as &#x27;open field system&#x27;. Originally, there were 32 strips of land and families would work two or three. Beyond were fields known as the Doles, common grazing land.

Doles Lane, a public right of way, still exists and starts (as Well Lane), opposite the Black Horse Inn a meeting place for Luddites, the machine wreckers, in the early 19th century. Highley Hall (formerly Crosse Hall), near the war memorial, was a farm until the 1990s. Originally the family home of Richard de Hileagh, constable of the village in the mid-14th century; it is now again a private residence.

==Education==

The village, a &#x27;Village Design Statement&#x27; area, has a junior and infant school, St John&#x27;s Primary Academy, originally built in the 1870s. It is a top-performing school, which was called &#x27;outstanding&#x27; in successive Ofsted inspections such as in 2014. It was 7th best in England for SATS level 5 in December 2007. The academy has had many names, but was first called Clifton School, but now it is called St. John&#x27;s CE Primary Academy, Clifton.

==Religious sites==
There is an Anglican church (first baptism Goldthorpe Squire 1859, first burial Zillah Ramsden 1860) within the Church of England Diocese of Leeds, and a Methodist church. Patrick Brontë, father of the novelist sisters, was Minister at the nearby Hartshead-cum-Clifton church.

==Sport==
Adjacent to the village is Willow Valley Golf Club. Each June, the club hosts the annual Yorkshire PGA Championship.

<doc id="1094690" wikidata="Q7208229" url="?curid=1094690" title="Point of Grace">
<text>Point of Grace is an all-female contemporary Christian music vocal group. The current trio consists of Shelley Breen, Denise Jones, and Leigh Cappillino. The group started out as a quartet in 1991, with original members Breen and Jones, as well as Terry Jones and Heather Payne. Terry Jones left in November 2003 to spend more time with her family after the birth of her third child, with Cappillino joining in March 2004 for their 2004 release &quot;I Choose You&quot;. In June 2008, Payne announced her retirement from the group to spend more time with her family.

The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1993. In 2003, they released their ninth album, &quot;24&quot; – a compilation of 24 previous hits.

== Biography ==

=== 1991–1992: Early years ===
Point of Grace was formed at Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) in Arkadelphia, Arkansas by Denise Masters, Terry Lang, and Heather Floyd, who knew one another from Norman, Oklahoma and sang together in a 14-member female vocal group called The Ouachitones. The three women formed a trio within the group, and were singing a cappella after a sound check when an onlooker suggested that they should do something together. Shelley Phillips from Little Rock, Arkansas came to OBU on a scholarship in vocal performance and was singing in a group called the Praise Singers, made up of four women and four men, who traveled around the country performing. She was a roommate and sister of Masters in the Chi Delta, and when Masters, Lang, and Floyd decided to form a trio, Phillips suggested that she join to form a quartet.

The group called themselves Say So, taken from Psalm 107:2 (&quot;Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.&quot;) The group shared their own management, with Floyd responsible for publicity and album sales, Lang for finances, Phillips for booking, and Masters in charge of music; they also carried and set up their own equipment before performances. They performed every weekend for the rest of that year, then recorded an independent album. They attended the 1992 Music in the Rockies Christian Artists Seminar in Estes Park, Colorado, at which they won the Overall Grand Prize in the Group competition with a performance of &quot;He&#x27;s The Best Thing&quot;. The group subsequently received interest from major record labels, and signed with Word Records, moving to Nashville to record their self-titled debut album.

=== 1993–1995: &quot;Point of Grace&quot; and &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; ===
On August 23, 1993, led by the No.1 single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Believing&quot;, Point of Grace released their self-titled debut album. The album&#x27;s next five singles also reached the top of the charts, a record that has not yet been equalled. In 1993, they were named New Artist of the Year at the 24th GMA Dove Awards and embarked on a national tour with Wayne Watson, for whom they sang backup after opening each concert. After that tour ended, they began doing concerts on their own.

The group went into the studio towards the end of 1994 to begin work on their second album, meeting 35 different songwriters. On March 15, 1995, &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; was released. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, reached No.1, the group&#x27;s seventh consecutive No.1 single. The album was a chart success, remaining at No.1 for 13 consecutive weeks, and in the Top 10 for 45 consecutive weeks. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1997, and the following four singles also reached the top of the charts. Point of Grace embarked on a nationwide tour with Phillips, Craig &amp; Dean and guest Cheri Keaggy, and were also a part of the Young Messiah Farewell Tour, alongside Sandi Patty, 4Him, and Larnelle Harris. They also contributed songs to several special-event albums. They recorded a new rendition of the hymn &quot;Fairest Lord Jesus&quot; for the &quot;Hymns &amp; Voices&quot; album; the song &quot;Hold On To Me&quot; for the &quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot; project; and a new version of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; for the album &quot;Christmas Carols Of The Young Messiah&quot;. They were named the 1996 Group of the Year at the Dove Awards and also won Doves for Pop/Contemporary Recorded Album of the Year (&quot;The Whole Truth&quot;), Pop/Contemporary Song of the Year (&quot;The Great Divide&quot;) and Special Event Album of the Year (&quot;My Utmost For His Highest&quot;).

=== 1996–1997: &quot;Life Love &amp; Other Mysteries&quot; ===

In July 1995, having been featured in publications such as the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; and &quot;TIME&quot; Magazine, the group signed a book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster, co-written with Davin Seay. The book included the life story of each member, and other chapters were divided into question-and-answer sections addressing topics like dating, sex, clothes, family life, and friends.

The group also began work on their third album. John Mays, the A&amp;R who had signed them to Word Records, had left to join Sparrow Records, and the group were left to make all major decisions, as executive producers of the album. The result was &quot;Life Love &amp; Other Mysteries&quot;, released on September 9, 1996. The book was released on the same day, subtitled &quot;Advice and Inspiration from Christian Music&#x27;s No. 1 Pop Group&quot;.

On the day of the album release, Word Records chartered the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; DC-9 jet and the group flew to five different cities in one day to promote the album. At each stop they performed their current single, &quot;Keep The Candle Burning&quot;, which went to No.1 on the day their album released, their twelfth consecutive No.1 single. A music video with footage from the whirlwind promo tour was released a few months later. The group announced a co-headline arena tour with 4Him, who had just released their album &quot;The Message&quot;, which was very successful, leading to the addition of a spring leg which lasted into early summer of 1997. In 1996, the group contributed the song &quot;Follow the Star&quot; to the album &quot;Emmanuel: A Musical Celebration of the Life of Christ&quot;. They were not able to go on the tour, with Avalon taking their place.

&quot;Life Love &amp; Other Mysteries&quot; has been among their highest-selling albums to date, certified gold by the RIAA in 1997 and platinum in 1999. The album debuted at No.1 and stayed there for 10 weeks, finishing as one of the Top 5 selling albums of 1997 and one of the Top 10 of 1998. The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album in 1997, and the group was nominated for the 1997 Group of the Year at the Dove Awards, with &quot;Keep The Candle Burning&quot; nominated for Song of the Year. The group performed the song during the live The Nashville Network broadcast from the Sommet Center. They continued touring until September 1997, taking a break when Masters&#x27;s first child was born in October.

=== 1998–2000: &quot;Steady On&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, and hiatus ===
Point of Grace began work on their new album in late 1997/early 1998, with producer Brown Bannister developing a more progressive, live band sound, and less programming than previous albums. Chris Eaton managed the vocal production, with more intricate vocal arrangements than previously. The group previewed some of the new songs, including &quot;Jesus Is&quot;, &quot;Steady On&quot;, and &quot;Better Days&quot;, at one-off concert dates in the spring and summer of 1998, with a pause in the middle of recording for Terry Jones to give birth to her first child on April 15.

The remaining members appeared at the 1998 Dove Awards, where they were nominated for Artist of the Year, Group of the Year, and Pop/Contemporary Song of the Year for &quot;Circle Of Friends&quot;, but did not win in any category. During The Nashville Network broadcast of the show, pre-show host Kathy Troccoli announced the birth of Jones&#x27; child a week earlier.

In July 1998, a new single was released, the title song from the album &quot;Steady On&quot;. A CD single was also released to Christian bookstores. The release include a pop remix and a dance remix version of &quot;Steady On&quot;, as well as enhanced content on the CD, such as brief bios of the group members, excerpts from a new devotional book, a photo gallery, and other anecdotes. The album was released on August 4, 1998, and debuted at No.1 on the SoundScan sales chart, remaining in the Top 10 for seven consecutive weeks. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 1999 and platinum in 2002. The lead single and title track reached the top of the charts, becoming Point of Grace&#x27;s 16th consecutive No.1 single. The next five singles achieved the same, making a total of 21 consecutive No.1s.

In October 1998, Point of Grace launched their first headline tour, &quot;The &quot;Steady On&quot; Tour&quot;, also the first time they had toured with their own band, led by Dana Cappillino. In 1999, they won Dove Awards for Group of the Year and Enhanced CD of the Year for the &quot;Steady On&quot; CD Single. At the 1999 Grammy Awards, they were nominated for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album for &quot;Steady On&quot;. Heather Floyd married in 1999 in the middle of the tour. They contributed the song &quot;The River&quot; to the &quot;Experiencing God&quot; album, the song &quot;Forever On And On&quot; to the &quot;Streams&quot; album project, and &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Leave You Now&quot; for &quot;The Mercy Project&quot;, dedicated to Mercy Ministries of America.

After &quot;The &quot;Steady On&quot; Tour&quot; ended in the Spring of 1999, the band began work on their first Christmas release, recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; London, England; and Montreal, Canada, again in collaboration with producer Bannister, A&amp;R man Brent Bourgeois, and Eaton as vocal arranger. The orchestra, arranged by Carl Marsh and Ronn Huff, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. The end result was &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, a mix of traditional Christmas songs and originals, released on September 27, 1999. The group received media attention around this time as &quot;Life Love &amp; Other Mysteries&quot; had just been certified platinum and &quot;The Song Is Alive&quot; had become their 21st No.1, appearing on &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The View&quot;, and &quot;The 700 Club&quot;. The quartet began touring together, but Terry Jones, who was nine months pregnant with her second child, left the tour halfway through, leaving the other three members to perform as a trio.

After the tour, the group took a year-long hiatus, regrouping occasionally for Women of Faith conferences and one or two individual dates. Word Records released &quot;Rarities &amp; Remixes&quot;, a collection of remixed hits from their first two releases, four songs from their independent album, two rare tracks, and a live version of &quot;Circle Of Friends&quot;.

=== 2001–2003: &quot;Free to Fly&quot;, Girls of Grace, and &quot;24&quot; ===

After the hiatus, Point of Grace regrouped in early 2001 to begin work on the follow-up to &quot;Steady On&quot;. They worked with six producers: Bannister, David Tyson, Nathan Nockels (who played keyboards for them on &quot;the Steady On Tour&quot;), Tom Laune, Glenn Garrett, and Wayne Tester, in order to achieve a diverse sound on the project. The lead single, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, was a radio hit, and reached No.1.

The album, &quot;Free to Fly&quot;, was released on May 1, 2001, and the same week the group opened the Dove Awards telecast. They promoted the album during the summer of 2001, performing at major Christian festivals and at their own concerts, while preparing for &quot;The Free To Fly Tour&quot;. On this tour, the group closed each show with a cappella rendition of &quot;America The Beautiful&quot;, in honour of the victims of the September 11 attacks.

In early 2002, Point of Grace began work on a new project, the Girls of Grace, working with the Tennessee Choral Academy, and female artists such as Rachael Lampa, Joy Williams, Out of Eden and Jaci Velasquez. Point of Grace previewed the Girls of Grace devotional book, workbook, journal and album during the 2002 GMA Week and premiered one of their songs from the project, &quot;All I&#x27;ll Ever Need&quot;, on the 2002 Dove Awards telecast. They continued performing concerts until the summer of 2002, when they took a few months off. Shelley and Heather gave birth to their first children in September, and in the same month, Terry gave birth to her third child.

The Girls of Grace album was released on August 20, 2002, and the first conference took place in October in Lakeland, Florida. Point of Grace opened the event with a concert on Friday night, followed on Saturday by speakers including Susie Shellenberger of BRIO Magazine, and Nancy Alcorn of Mercy Ministries of America, as well as musical guests, including Joy Williams in 2002, Out of Eden in 2003 and 2004, The Katinas at some conferences in 2004, and Jaime Jamgochian and M.O.C. in 2005 and 2006.

In 2003, the compilation album, &quot;24&quot; was released, featuring the group&#x27;s 24 greatest hits and a new song, &quot;Day By Day&quot;. They also released their first DVD, entitled &quot;7&quot;, which contained the videos to seven songs. In November 2003, they published a hardcover book titled &quot;Keep The Candle Burning: 24 Reflections From Our Favorite Songs&quot;. The group spent 2003 doing one-off shows, &quot;Girls of Grace&quot; concerts, and appeared on Michael W. Smith&#x27;s Christmastime Tour.

=== 2004–2006: Lineup changes, &quot;I Choose You&quot;, and &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; ===

In November 2003, Terry Jones announced her retirement from Point of Grace to focus on her family. She wrote a letter published on the group&#x27;s website, along with a letter from the remaining members announcing that band leader Dana Cappillino&#x27;s wife Leigh would replace Jones. Terry Jones&#x27;s last tour with the group was the 2003 Christmastime Tour with Michael W. Smith, and her last concert was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 28, 2004. Leigh Cappillino joined the group on January 1, 2004, but her first concert was in Atlanta, Georgia on March 12, 2004.

Cappillino&#x27;s first album with Point of Grace was &quot;I Choose You&quot;, released on October 12, 2004. The album featured a rawer, less glossy sound, developed with new producers including Mark Hammond, Wayne Kirkpatrick and David Zaffiro. Brent Bourgeois, who produced the song &quot;Forever On And On&quot; from the &quot;Streams&quot; album, also produced one track. They spent the remainder of 2004 doing promotional appearances and participating again in Michael W. Smith&#x27;s Christmastime Tour alongside The Katinas. In February 2005, they began the &quot;I Choose You&quot; Tour with Scott Krippayne and guest Charity Von. The tour visited 30 cities, and the set lists featured tracks from &quot;I Choose You&quot; as well as the group&#x27;s back catalog.

After the tour, the group began work on their second Christmas release, recorded through the summer of 2005. &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; was released on October 4, 2005. They launched their first Christmas tour, the &quot;Winter Wonderland Tour&quot; in late November, playing 16 concerts. The show had John David Webster, who had featured on &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;, as a special guest, and local choirs participated in every show.

In 2006, the group resumed their Girls of Grace activities, and began working with Michael Passons, formerly of Avalon, who began touring with them. At one-off shows, the group&#x27;s performances featured acoustic segments with Dana Cappillino and Michael Passons accompanying the vocalists on guitar and piano, respectively. Heather also gave birth to her third child in 2006. The group reprised the Winter Wonderland Tour in 2006 with guest Scott Krippayne.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;How You Live&quot; ===
Point of Grace spent the first half of 2007 finishing their album &quot;How You Live&quot;. During that time, they contributed an a cappella rendition of the hymn &quot;All Hail The Power Of Jesus&#x27; Name&quot; to the &quot;WoW Hymns&quot; project, released in March 2007. They promoted the first two singles, &quot;All The World&quot; and &quot;You Are Good&quot; during GMA Week in April, and added a few album tracks to their live shows. They shot a video to the single &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music)&quot;, in mid-June, released on their website in early July. Led by the single &quot;All The World&quot;, they released the album &quot;How You Live&quot; in late August. &quot;All The World&quot; made the Top 40 in the Mediabase charts. The follow-up single, &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music)&quot; peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. The album peaked at #56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at #4 on the Top Christian &amp; Gospel Album Charts. The unexpected success of the album and single earned the group five Dove Award nominations, including Song of the Year for &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music)&quot;, Group of the Year and Artist of the Year. &quot;How You Live&quot; was released to country radio in April 2008, entering the country charts at #56.

In February 2008, the band began the &quot;All The World&quot; Tour with guests Selah and Michael Passons, who had become the group&#x27;s regular keyboardist.

In February 2008, Point of Grace was nominated for five Dove Awards, including Group of the Year and Artist of The Year. They performed their single &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music)&quot; with Cindy Morgan, the song&#x27;s writer. They picked up the award for Country Recorded Song of the Year and Cindy Morgan won Songwriter of the Year for &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music).&quot; In the same week of the Doves telecast, they made their debut on the Grand Ole Opry stage, signifying their increasing move into the country music market. They have appeared on the show several times since their debut.

In June 2008, Heather Payne announced that she was retiring to spend time with her children and support her husband in his ministry. Breen, Cappillino and Denise Jones announced they would continue as a trio, and recorded new music for the re-release of their album &quot;How You Live&quot;, released in October 2008. The group&#x27;s keyboardist Michael Passons, also a solo artist and former member of Avalon, sings on some of the group&#x27;s older four-part harmonies.

The band released &quot;How You Live: Deluxe Edition&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Christmas: A Holiday Collection&quot; in early October, and went on their annual &quot;Winter Wonderland Tour&quot; in early December, with guest Ronnie Freeman.

In 2009, the group began by appearing at the Grand Ole Opry, performing &quot;I Wish&quot; and &quot;How You Live (Turn Up The Music)&quot;. Their song, &quot;I Wish&quot;, won the Dove Award for Country Recorded Song of the Year for songwriters, Cindy Morgan and Phil Madeira.

On August 23, 2009, the group appeared on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;Huckabee&quot;, performing &quot;King of the World&quot;, the last single from &quot;How You Live&quot;, accompanied by Mike Huckabee on bass guitar.

=== 2010–present: &quot;No Changin&#x27; Us&quot;, &quot;A Thousand Little Things&quot;, &quot;Directions Home&quot; ===

The album &quot;No Changin&#x27; Us&quot;, produced by Nathan Chapman, was released on March 2, 2010, featuring a more country sound. They embarked on a fall tour with Mark Schultz, called the &quot;Come Alive Tour&quot;. Alongside the album, they released a cookbook, &quot;Cooking with Grace&quot;, co-written with Julie Adkison.

The summer of 2010 was spent recording a new holiday album, &quot;Home For The Holidays&quot;, released on October 5, 2010. The group headlined a Christmas tour in support of the album.

A new album, &quot;A Thousand Little Things&quot;, was released on May 1, 2012.

Another album, &quot;Directions Home&quot;, was released on April 7, 2015.

In April 2018, they released a hymn and worship album called &quot;Beautiful Name&quot;. In August 2018, Point of Grace were inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall Of Fame.

In October 2021, they released a new Christmas album called &quot;Sing Nöel&quot;.

== Other activities ==

=== Mercy Ministries ===
Since the beginning of their career, Point of Grace have supported Mercy Ministries of America, a non-profit organization that works with young women facing issues such as abuse, depression, unplanned pregnancies and eating disorders. The group frequently promote Mercy Ministries at their concerts, and founder Nancy Alcorn or other representatives from the organization have frequently appeared on tour with them to describe the work of Mercy Ministries. Alcorn is a regular featured speaker at the Girls of Grace conferences.

=== Compassion International ===
In 2006, the group began showing support for Compassion International, a Christian child-sponsorship organization dedicated to the long-term development of children living in poverty around the world. In March 2006, Heather Payne and her husband Brian traveled to El Salvador to meet their sponsored child, and in April 2006, Shelley Breen, Denise Jones and Leigh Cappillino went to Ecuador to meet their sponsored children. The group has partnered with Compassion to raise awareness for poverty and urge their listeners to sponsor children as well.

<text>Luis Royo (born 1954) is a Spanish artist. He is best known for his fantasy illustrations published in numerous art books, magazines such as &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and various other media including book and music CD covers, video games and Tarot cards.

Beginning his career as a furniture designer, he was attracted to the comics industry in the late 1970s by the work of artists like Enki Bilal and Moebius, and in 1979 he turned to art as a full-time career. Within a few years, he was publishing art within and on the covers of such magazines as &quot;Comix Rambla Internacional&quot;, &quot;El Vibora&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, and &quot;Comic Art&quot; as well as providing cover illustrations for several American publishers.

==Biography==
Royo was born in Olalla, a village in the Aragonese province of Teruel.

In 1983, Royo began working as an illustrator for publishers in the United States such as Tor Books, Berkley Books, Avon and Bantam Books.

As his reputation grew, other publishers contacted Royo and he created custom covers for novels and magazines for Ballantine Books, NAL, DAW Books, Doubleday (publisher), HarperCollins, Zendra, Hasa Corporation, Penthouse Comix, Pocket Books with &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; series and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; novels, also Fleer for Ultra X-Men by Marvel.

An ongoing collaboration with &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; produced a large number of magazine covers including the 20th anniversary issue in 1997. Illustrations for the character F.A.A.K. were based on actress Julie Strain.

Royo&#x27;s other well-known covers for fantasy and science fiction titles of this period included &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; by Isaac Asimov, Conan by Robert E. Howard, &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke and &quot;StarMan&quot; and &quot;Wayfarer Redemption&quot; saga by Sara Douglass among others.

&quot;Women&quot;, Royo&#x27;s first art book was published in 1992. It brings together many of his cover illustrations up to that date into one volume. His second book, &quot;Malefic&quot;, was published in 1994 and was dedicated to fantasy and science fiction imagery. This was followed in 1996 by &quot;Secrets&quot;, which was dedicated to erotism. Later art books, (&quot;III Millennium&quot;, &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Visions&quot; and &quot;Dark Labyrinth&quot;) explored the same genres combining science fiction, apocalyptic worlds and myths of beauty and the beast, but received criticism for their explicit content.

In 2006, joined by Romulo Royo, Luis Royo traveled to Moscow to complete a commission to paint a fresco on a domed ceiling, reflecting classic themes of eroticism. The process and result of this work was published in another art book, &quot;Dome&quot;.

Royo began to work on &quot;Dead Moon&quot; in 2009, a project with an oriental theme. This produced two art books, &quot;Dead Moon&quot; and &quot;Dead Moon: Epilogue&quot; that tell a love story. Royo also designed a tarot deck using the &quot;Dead Moon&quot; theme. The original paintings were exhibited at Salón del Manga de Barcelona, ExpoManga and retail store Fnac.

In 2011, Luis and Romulo Royo started a multimedia project, &quot;Malefic Time&quot;, that included illustrated novels, a role playing game, figures based on illustrations, calendars and other spin-offs.

Royo worked with George R. R. Martin in 2014 to produce illustrations for Martin&#x27;s novelette, &quot;The Ice Dragon&quot;.

In 2018, he published the chest Projects with two books: Goddesses and Custom-Made, compiling his last works and projects.

Among his latest exhibitions are &quot;Art Generations&quot; at the Palazzo Ducale in the walled city of Lucca, organized by the Lucca Comics &amp; Games fair, the exhibition space with more prestige worldwide dedicated to fantasy, &quot;The Dream of Fantasy&quot; at the European Museum of Modern Art (MEAM) in Barcelona, and &quot;Komorebi Eterno: Japan through Fantasy Art&quot; at the Spanish-Japanese Cultural Center of Salamanca.

As a culmination of his artistic career, the Uffizi Gallery (Florence, Italy) has requested his self-portrait to add it to its collection.

==Awards and exhibitions==
In 1994 &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine reported on Royo&#x27;s work and later in 1996, one of his images was used on the cover of the American and German editions, both with an interior report. In the same year he received the Spectrum silver award for best contemporary fantastic art. Reports on his work also appeared in other publications: &quot;La Stampa&quot; in Italy, &quot;Airbrush Action&quot; in the United States and &quot;Penthouse Comic&quot; in Germany.

In 1998 Royo exhibited at the Norma Gallery in Barcelona and at the Viñetas desde o Atlántico comic festival in A Coruña. He received the Millennium Prize at the 7th Salone del Fumetto Cartoomics convention in Milan in 2000. He also exhibited his work in St. Petersburg in 2001 and received the El Peregrino fantasy award at CTPAHHNK.

In 2006 Royo exhibited his work at the 24th Barcelona comic fair. He also received the Unicorn fantasy award at the 7th International Fantasy and Terror Film Week in Málaga.

Royo won the Inkpot Award at San Diego Comic-Con in 2015.

<text>Commodore DOS, also known as CBM DOS, is the disk operating system used with Commodore&#x27;s 8-bit computers. Unlike most other DOSes, which are loaded from disk into the computer&#x27;s own RAM and executed there, CBM DOS is executed internally in the drive: the DOS resides in ROM chips inside the drive, and is run there by one or more dedicated MOS 6502 family CPUs. Thus, data transfer between Commodore 8-bit computers and their disk drives more closely resembles a local area network connection than typical disk/host transfers.

== CBM DOS versions ==
At least seven distinctly numbered versions of Commodore DOS are known to exist; the following list gives the version numbers and related disk drives. Unless otherwise noted, drives are 5¼-inch format. The &quot;lp&quot; code designates &quot;low-profile&quot; drives. Drives whose model number starts with 15 connect via Commodore&#x27;s unique serial IEEE-488 bus (IEC Bus) serial (TALK/LISTEN) protocols; all others use the parallel IEEE-488.

*   1.0 – found in the 2040 and 3040 floppy drives
*   2.0 – found in the 4040 and 3040 floppy drives
*   2.5 – found in the 8050 floppy drives
*   2.6 – found in the 1540, 1541 including the one built into the SX-64, 1551, 2031 (+&quot;lp&quot;), and 4031 floppy drives
*   2.7 – found in the 8050, 8250 (+&quot;lp&quot;), and SFD-1001 floppy drives
*   3.0 – found in the 1570, external 1571, and 8280 floppy drives (8280: 8-inch), as well as the 9060 and 9090 hard drives
*   3.1 – found in the built-in 1571 drive of C128DCR computers
* 10.0 – found in the 1581 (3½-inch) floppy drive

Version 2.6 was by far the most commonly used and widely known DOS version, due to its use in the 1541 as part of C64 systems.

Note: The revised firmware for the 1571 which fixed the relative file bug was &quot;also&quot; identified as V3.0. Thus it is not possible to differentiate the two versions using the version number alone.

==Technical overview==

===1541 directory and file types===
The 1541 Commodore floppy disk can contain up to 144 files in a flat namespace (no subdirectories); the directory is stored on reserved track 18, which is located halfway from the hub to the edge of a 35-track single-sided disk. A file name may be up to 16 bytes in length and is theoretically unique; by using direct access methods on the directory structure, it is possible to rename a file to that of another—although accessing such files may be difficult or impossible. Files with identical names usually serve no purpose except to inform or visually manage files. One popular trick, used, for example, by The Final Cartridge III, was to add files named codice_1 of type codice_2 to the directory, and files could then be rearranged around those lines to form groups. Many game developers, warez group members, and demoscene hackers used some more clever custom directory entries as well.

File names may contain a shifted space character (codice_3), and if the directory listing is being viewed from BASIC, the portion of the file name beyond the codice_4 character will appear to have been separated from the first part of the file name by a quotation mark, causing BASIC to not consider it to be part of the full file name. This feature can be used to create directory entries such as , which will then appear in the directory listing as, for example, . When the user moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, types the word codice_5 over the file size, and presses , BASIC interprets that as , causing the program to be loaded into memory. Anything after the colon or the secondary address will not be executed, since the computer ignores any command after a LOAD. Alternatively, the user could press to and the program automatically.

A null byte embedded in a file name will interrupt the listing after loading by BASIC. If there are three null bytes, that makes it difficult to list through BASIC. Many machine language programmers would experiment with null bytes in an attempt to make it harder for BASIC programmers to access their code and tamper with it.

In BASIC, the directory can be accessed as a non-executable pseudo-BASIC program with (or in the case of a dual drive) followed by codice_6. The first line has a line number of 0 or 1 (indicating the drive number), showing in reverse video the name and ID of the disk and a shorthand code for the DOS version with which it was created (codes vary only as far as the DOS versions use incompatible disk formats: &quot;2A&quot; is used by most 5.25-inch DOS versions, &quot;3D&quot; by the 3.5-inch 1581). Lines after this have the size of a file (in disk blocks) as their pseudo &quot;line number&quot;, followed by the file name in quotes and the three-letter type code. The last line shows the number of unallocated blocks on the disk (again as a pseudo &quot;line number&quot;), followed by the words &quot;BLOCKS FREE.&quot;

On the Commodore 64, entering will flood the screen with garbage instead of loading the directory into BASIC RAM. This is because the drive assigns the directory a load address of $0401 (1025), which is equivalent to the start of BASIC for the Commodore PET, but corresponds to the default screen memory in the C64 (starting with the second character on the first line of the screen).

Viewing the directory with a command overwrites the BASIC program in memory. The DOS Wedge and various third-party cartridges and extenders such as Epyx Fast Load, Action Replay, and The Final Cartridge III allow viewing of the disk directory using special commands that load the directory into screen memory without destroying the current BASIC program. Some versions of Commodore BASIC include a codice_7 or codice_8 command that performs the same function.

The following file types are supported:

;codice_9
: A sequential file is a data file that can be linearly read from start to finish. codice_9 files are commonly used to store documents or text files created by a word processor or other such editor. A sequential file is analogous to a flat file in Linux or UNIX, in that it has no specialized internal structure. It is not possible to position to any arbitrary location in a sequential file, as there is no analog of the codice_11 kernel call found in UNIX-like operating systems.
;codice_12
: codice_12 files normally contain executable program code, although they can also be used for data files. The first two bytes of the codice_12 are read by the kernal &quot;load file&quot; routine and used to determine the load address (they are stored in a little endian format).
;codice_15
: A relative file is a variation of the sequential file type, in which an indexing mechanism referred to as side-sectors is present to permit record-oriented access. Records may be a maximum of 254 bytes in size and are addressed by a one-based cardinal number, permitting true random access to any part of the file.
;codice_16
: A user-specified file has an internal structure that is identical to that of a sequential file. Commodore&#x27;s original purpose for this file type was the facilitation of DOS development, as the file content could be copied into a drive buffer for execution by the drive&#x27;s microprocessor. Very few programs ever made use of this file type. Some applications that use non-standard low-level disk structures save data in USR format, which came to be considered a sort of &quot;leave me alone, don&#x27;t try to copy or delete&quot; indication to the user. Most notably, GEOS&#x27; &quot;VLIR&quot; files show up as codice_16 files.
;codice_18
: An undocumented internally used file type similar in structure to a sequential file. Creation of this file type must be accomplished by direct manipulation of the disk directory.

The presence of an asterisk (codice_19) prepended to the file type in a directory listing (for example, codice_20) indicates that the file was not properly closed after writing. When the drive is commanded to close a file that has been opened for writing, the associated buffer is flushed to the disk and the block availability map (BAM) is updated to accurately reflect which blocks have been used. If a program crash or other problem (such as the user removing the disk while a file is open) results in an &quot;orphan file&quot;, also referred to as a &quot;poison&quot; or &quot;splat&quot; file, buffers are not flushed and the BAM will not accurately reflect disk usage, putting the disk at risk of corruption. A poison file generally cannot be accessed (but can be opened in &quot;modify&quot; mode), and an attempt to use the DOS codice_21 command to delete the file may cause filesystem corruption, such as crosslinking. The only practical method of removing one of these files is by opening the file in &quot;modify&quot; mode (and fixing it), or by validating the disk (see the DOS codice_22 command below), the latter which rebuilds the BAM and removes poison file references from the directory. The infamous save-with-replace bug could result in creation of splat files.

codice_23 is a special type written into the on-disk directory entry of files that have been deleted. Such files are not shown in a normal directory listing, and their data blocks and directory entries will be reused by files that are subsequently created. Some utility programs allow the &quot;un-deletion&quot; of such files if their data blocks and directory entries haven not yet been overwritten by other files. codice_24 are commonly used to insert banners or comment sections into a directory listing.

File types with codice_25 after them (for example, codice_26) are &quot;locked&quot;, and cannot be deleted—they can be opened for reading, however. There is no Commodore DOS command that can explicitly set or clear this status, but many third-party utilities were written to allow this to be done. These utilities generally read the directory using direct-access commands, perform the necessary modifications to the raw data, and then write the changes back to the disk.

===File access===
Accessing files is primarily an issue for the host computer. The kernal ROM in the computer contains the necessary primitive routines needed to access files, and the BASIC ROM contains a higher level abstraction for file access using BASIC syntax. The components that concern the DOS itself are file name parsing and the secondary address. This section will give an overview of the necessary BASIC commands for the sake of completeness.

Opening a file on a Commodore disk unit entails the processing of a number of parameters that are vaguely analogous to file opening procedures in other environments. Since the DOS is actually running in the drive&#x27;s controller, the file opening sequence must pass enough information to the drive to assure unambiguous interpretation. A typical statement in BASIC to write to a sequential file would be as follows:

The parameters following the codice_27 verb are as follows:

;3
:This parameter, the &quot;file number&quot;, logically identifies the opened file within the &quot;computer&#x27;s&quot; operating system and is analogous to a file descriptor in UNIX-like operating systems. It is never sent to the drive and thus is neither known nor used by the drive&#x27;s own operating system. The file number may be in the range of 1 to 254 inclusive, is assigned by the programmer and must be unique if more than one file is simultaneously opened. Once the file has been opened all program input and output procedures use the file number. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as LA (logical address), the abbreviation coming from the mnemonic that refers to the memory location where the file number is stored. File numbers greater than 127 cause the system to write an extra line feed after each carriage return (useful for double spacing a document, as an example.)
;8
:This parameter, the &quot;device number&quot;, identifies a specific peripheral attached to the computer. Devices 0 through 3 address the keyboard, tape cassette, RS-232 interface, and video display, respectively, all of which are directly controlled by the kernal ROM. Device numbers 4 and higher address devices attached to the peripheral bus, such as printers or disk drives. In the case of a disk drive, the device number refers to the unit&#x27;s controller, not the drive mechanism(s) within the unit. By convention, the first disk drive unit on a system has device number 8, the second drive, if present, 9, etc., up to a maximum number of 15 (when eight disk drives are attached). The device number scheme was derived from the IEEE-488 (or general purpose interface GPIB) bus that was used with the Commodore PET/CBM models. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as FA or PA (physical address), again from the mnemonic for the memory location where the device number is stored.
;4
:This parameter, the &quot;secondary address&quot;, which may range from 0 to 15 inclusive, refers to a specific communication channel established with the device&#x27;s controller and is passed to the device when it is commanded to &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;listen&quot; on the peripheral bus. As with the file number, the secondary address is determined by the programmer and must be unique for the device in question. The range 0 to 14 inclusive is used for passing data to or from the device, whereas 15, referred to as the &quot;command channel&quot;, is used to issue commands to the device&#x27;s controller (such as to rename a disk file), if the device is able to support such an operation. In disk drives, secondary addresses 0 to 14 inclusive are mapped to buffers within the controller, hence establishing communication with a specific file on a specific disk; since as mentioned above the drive does not know about the &quot;file number&quot;, it can only use the &quot;secondary address&quot; to make a difference between several files that are open at the same time. On the other hand, the host operating system is agnostic about the secondary address; it is transmitted to the drive on every access to the file, but not otherwise used by the host. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as SA (secondary address).
;COMMAND STRING
:The codice_28 parameter is officially referred to in Commodore documentation as the &quot;command string&quot; and is interpreted by the controller of the device being accessed. In the case of a disk drive unit, the formal command string structure consists of the drive mechanism number (codice_29, not to be confused with the device number), filename (codice_30), file type (codice_31, sequential in this example) and access mode (codice_32, opened for writing in this example). In practice, some of these parameters may be omitted. Minimally, only the filename is required if the file is to be opened for reading.

:The drive number identifies a drive mechanism attached to a disk unit&#x27;s controller and is analogous to a logical unit number in a SCSI controller that is capable of controlling multiple mechanisms (e.g., the OMTI SASI controllers that were developed to work with ST-412/ST-506 hard drives in the 1980s). In floppy disk units, the first mechanism is drive 0: and the second is 1:. It is fairly common practice to omit the drive number when communicating with a single drive floppy unit, as 0: is the default in such units, but since omitting the number can trigger a few obscure bugs in the DOS it is not a recommended practice (a colon alone is equivalent to 0: and is enough to avoid those bugs). An exception to this convention is with the Lt. Kernal hard disk subsystem, in which the drive number refers to &quot;logical units&quot; (virtual drives created on a single physical drive), which made syntax such as 4: or 10: necessary if a file to be opened was not on logical unit zero (equivalent to drive mechanism zero in a dual floppy unit).

Files can also be loaded and saved to with codice_5 and codice_34 commands. File name specifiers can also be used here, for example, saves the BASIC program to a codice_12 (program) file and saves the BASIC program to a sequential file. If the secondary address isn&#x27;t specified or is specified as 0 (e.g. ), the file is saved/loaded from the BASIC memory area (which, on the C64, starts by default at $0801). If the secondary address is specified as a non-zero value (e.g. ), the program is loaded starting from the address specified by the file itself (the PRG header, which is the first two bytes of the file)—this form of command is more common when loading machine code programs.

Load relocation was first introduced on the VIC-20 because this machine could start BASIC RAM in several different locations, depending on the memory expansion that was installed. The older Commodore PET series did not support relocation, so and would have the same effect: the file would be loaded into the same memory region from which it was saved. Load relocation happens in the host, being an exception to what is said above about the secondary address being used only device-internally. Since the PET cannot relocate files, BASIC programs written on later Commodore machines must be modified by using a sector editor to change the header bytes. It is also possible to use the PET&#x27;s built-in machine language monitor to change the link address for the BASIC program after loading it.

The command will load the first program on the disk starting from the file-specified memory location. This is one of the most popular load commands of the platforms, the method to start majority of commercial software, for example. Of note is the fact that the wildcard expansion will only pick the first catalog name when no other file on that disk has been accessed before; the name of the last-used file is kept in memory, and subsequent commands will load that file rather than the first. (However, or will always load the first file on the disk.)

The directories of disks in two-drive units are accessed as and . codice_36 and codice_37 do not access the directory but actual files on one drive or the other that just happen to be named codice_38. Partial directories can be loaded by adding a colon and a template: for example, would load a partial directory that shows only the files whose name starts with the letter K and which are of type PRG; all such partial directories still contain the initial disk name line and the final &quot;BLOCKS FREE&quot; line.

===The save-with-replace bug===
Commodore DOS also offers a &quot;Save-with-Replace&quot; command, which allows a file to be saved over an existing file without the need to first codice_39 the existing file. This was done by prepending an codice_40 symbol to the file name during the codice_27 or codice_34 operation - for instance, . For years rumors spread, beginning with the 4040 drive, of a bug in the command&#x27;s implementation. At first, this was denied by some commentators. Prizes were offered to prove the existence of the bug. By early 1985 &quot;Compute!&quot; magazine advised readers to avoid using the command. That year various authors independently published articles proving that the Save-with-Replace bug was real and including methods by which it could be triggered.

Affected devices included the single-drive 1541 and dual-drive 4040; the 8050 and 8250 did not exhibit the issue. Some commentators suggested the bug could be avoided by always explicitly specifying the codice_29 drive number when saving, though it was later shown that &quot;any&quot; disk operations without a drive number were sufficient to lead to the bug. The bug stemmed from the fact that the affected DOS implementations were modified versions of the DOS contained in earlier Commodore PET dual drives such as the 8050. This created a &quot;phantom drive codice_44&quot; on single-drive systems, resulting in the allocation of an unnecessary buffer under some conditions. Since the Save-with-Replace command used all five drive buffers, and because the method by which the &quot;phantom&quot; buffer was allocated did not meet specifications, this could result in scrambled data being written to the disk.

In September 1986, Philip A. Slaymaker published an article describing in great detail the cause of the bug and providing patches to the 1541 drive ROMs; readers with an EPROM burner could produce their own patched ROMs which could be swapped into the drive. Commodore was made aware of Slaymaker&#x27;s findings, and while they never issued an official update for the original 1541&#x27;s ROMs, they did fix the bug in Revision 5 of the 1571 ROMs, and also in the ROMs for the 1541-c and 1541-II drives. Although not supported by Commodore, it is known that the 1541-II firmware (but not that of the 1541-c) can also be used in an original 1541 drive by using EPROMs, which will fix the bug for that drive as well.

===Command channel===
As previously noted, the Commodore DOS itself is accessed via the &quot;command channel&quot;, using syntax like that used to access files. Issuing commands to the DOS and retrieving status and error messages generated in response to commands is accomplished by opening a file to the device using 15 as the secondary address, for example:

To retrieve and display the device status, one could code:

In the above example, codice_45 will hold the error number (if any; it will be zero if no error exists), codice_46 will be a terse text description of the error, codice_47 will represent the disk track where the error occurred, and codice_31 will be the sector on track codice_47 to which the error refers. If no error exists, the equivalent of will be returned in the four variables. Note that codice_50 is a run mode only verb. Also, in programs that issue many disk commands it is customary to open a file to the device&#x27;s command channel at the start of the program and not close it until the program has finished.

Commodore BASIC versions 4.0 and later provide a pseudo-variable referred to as codice_51 that may be used to retrieve drive status in lieu of the above code. This reserved variable is not available on earlier versions of BASIC, so the command channel must be manually read as demonstrated above. Note that immediately after power-on or reset, the DOS revision will be returned. For example, a 1541 will return . Error code 73 is common to all drive models and may be used to determine if the drive has been reset to its power-on state.

==DOS commands==
There are also a command for seeking in RELative type files (codice_52), several block-level direct-access commands (codice_53, codice_54, codice_55), block management (codice_56, codice_57), drive memory manipulation and execution of program code on the drive&#x27;s processor (codice_58, codice_59, codice_60, codice_61) and user-definable functions (codice_62 and codice_63 commands). Some of the theoretically user-definable functions were rededicated for accessing new functionality in DOS versions after 1.0.

<text>The Liberal Party was a political party established in the latter half of the 1800s in Utah Territory before the national Democrats and Republicans established themselves in Utah in the early 1890s.

The Liberal Party formed in 1870 to oppose Mormons, which dominated local politics via the People&#x27;s Party. The Liberal Party thus represented opposition to government controlled by organized religious groups.

Though vastly outnumbered, the Liberal Party offered an opposing voice and won several local elections. Anti-Mormonism remained a central theme of the party until it disbanded in 1893 and became absorbed by the national parties.

== Origins ==
The impetus for the setting up of the Liberal Party came from William S. Godbe, a successful businessman and Latter-day Saint who founded a journal called &quot;Utah Magazine&quot; in 1868. Godbe and several business associates challenged the economic policies of LDS Church President Brigham Young in the monthly periodical, especially Young&#x27;s opposition to mining. When increasingly harsh condemnations aimed at LDS leadership appeared, the LDS Church excommunicated key &quot;Godbeites&quot; on October 25, 1869.

Corresponding during the winter, key Godbeites and non-Mormons made an uneasy alliance based on their shared opposition to LDS control over temporal matters in the territory.
The Liberal Party formed after a meeting on February 9, 1870 to select independent candidates for the Salt Lake City municipal election. The organizers billed the occasion as a meeting of the &quot;people.&quot; A crowd of Latter-day Saints, encouraged by local bishops and a &quot;Deseret Evening News&quot; editorial, attended in numbers and nearly hijacked the meeting. After the LDS crowd had selected its own slate of candidates, frustrated Godbeite Eli B. Kelsey asked the Mormons to leave, which they did. The remaining non-Mormons selected an independent municipal ticket, forming the Liberal Party. Liberal leaders intended that their party&#x27;s name suggest reform and evoke Britain&#x27;s Liberal Party.

In response, Latter-day Saints formed the People&#x27;s Party, a title that was selected to suggest popularity; it alluded to the Liberal Party&#x27;s disrupted meeting of &quot;the people&quot;. Latter-day Saints had previously won virtually all elections unchallenged.

Early Liberal Party speakers carefully avoided condemning LDS theology or polygamy, because several Godbeites themselves practised polygamy. Eli B. Kelsey and Henry W. Lawrence, both Godbeites, gained election as the first officers of the new party. Non-Mormons, including R. N. Baskin, George R. Maxwell, and Judge Dennis Toohy of Corinne, played an active role in the party but stayed in the background initially, hoping that ex-Mormon Godbeites would prove more effective leaders and candidates.

Godbeites believed they should reform Utah and the LDS Church to adopt more politically-progressive policies, but the non-Mormon element of the party took a more adversarial line. Non-Mormon partisans, especially miners and railroad workers, would increasingly dominate party leadership. Through the 1870s, the Liberal Party grew less appeasing of Godbeites and more openly anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy. Waning Godbeite influence was shown even by 1871, when Liberals Dennis Toohy and George R. Maxwell infuriated Godbeites at a party meeting by calling polygamists &quot;dupes&quot; and criminals of perverse sensuality.

Like many political parties of the time, the Liberal Party ran a newspaper although unofficially. Godbe&#x27;s &quot;Utah Magazine&quot; became the &quot;Mormon Weekly Tribune&quot; and in 1873, three anti-Mormon newcomers from Kansas bought it and it became &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;. Until the Liberal Party disbanded in 1893, the &quot;Tribune&quot; would operate as the Liberal Party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; political organ. Similarly, the &quot;Deseret Evening News&quot;, owned by the LDS Church, often functioned as a People&#x27;s Party organ.

== History ==

Unsurprisingly, the Liberal Party performed poorly against the Mormon majority. In the 1870 Salt Lake City mayoral race, Liberal Henry W. Lawrence lost to Daniel H. Wells 321 to 2301. Statewide contests produced even more lopsided figures, with Liberals regularly failing to garner 10% of the vote. Although Liberals never won a single statewide office, the party served as a political foil and won several local elections, including:

*The so-called Tooele Republic in 1874
*Ogden, Utah in 1889
*Salt Lake City, Utah in 1890

When the party first formed in 1870, party officials tried to win offices in the town of Corrine and reasoned that they could more readily overwhelm the small local population. They failed but continued to scout other promising areas.

In Tooele County, perhaps the only non-Mormon majority in the territory existed. Its residents, mostly transitory miners, congregated in Utah after US Army General Patrick Edward Connor encouraged his men to prospect for minerals, which they discovered west of Salt Lake City in 1864.

The Liberal Party, campaigning voraciously in mining towns, won a disputed election in August 1874. The People&#x27;s Party incumbents, citing fraud, refused to yield their positions even as US Marshals authorized by the 3rd District federal court attempted to intervene and install the Liberal candidates. Brigham Young advised his followers to abide by the federal court, which they finally did.

Liberals carried all offices in the county, which they called the Tooele Republic. Running unopposed in 1876, Liberals held the county until the Utah territorial legislature passed bills in 1878 that required voter registration and instituting women&#x27;s suffrage. The Liberal Party, typically supported by male miners casually interested in politics, opposed both measures. In 1878 the Liberal electoral majority in Tooele County disappeared, and the People&#x27;s Party regained control in 1879, after more than six months of Liberal procedural delays.

By 1880, the Liberal Party had become severely atrophied, but it was openly supported by the newly appointed strongly anti-Mormon territorial governor, Eli H. Murray. Thus, the 1880 statewide election for the US House of Representatives unexpectedly proved the closest that the Liberal Party got to sending a representative to Washington, DC.

The Liberal candidate, Allen G. Campbell, with 1357 votes, lost resoundingly to Mormon General Authority George Q. Cannon who had 18,567 votes. In fact, the election marked the all-time low percentage-wise showing for any Liberal House candidate. However, before Governor Murray certified the election, a protest on behalf of Campbell was filed. The protest listed a dozen claims, chiefly that Cannon, born in Liverpool, England; was not a naturalized alien, and was a polygamist, which was incompatible with the law and a delegate&#x27;s oath of office. Murray agreed, and issued certification to Campbell in spite of the latter&#x27;s poor showing.

George Q. Cannon, then in Washington, DC, argued that only Congress could decide on a member&#x27;s qualifications. He furthermore received a certificate from sympathetic territorial election officials that stated he had received the most votes. The document convinced the House of Representatives clerk to enter Cannon&#x27;s name on the roll and so Cannon began drawing delegate&#x27;s salary.

Both Murray and Campbell traveled to Washington to dispute the seat. Each side battled over the position for over a year even despite the assassination and eventual death of President James Garfield. On February 25, 1882, the House of Representatives finally rejected both candidates. The House refused Cannon his seat not for his dubious citizenship but for his practice of polygamy. The entire ordeal actually brought unfavorable national attention to the &quot;Mormon Situation&quot; on polygamy.

In a November 7, 1882 election to fill the vacated seat, the Liberal Party fielded Philip T. Van Zile, but the seat was ultimately won by John T. Caine, of the People&#x27;s Party. Of the 33,266 registered voters, 23,039 votes were cast for Caine, and Van Zile received 4884. About 12,000 people were excluded from registering based on suspicion of polygamy.

National outrage against polygamy benefited the Liberal Party in Utah. On March 23, 1882, the anti-polygamy Edmunds Act became law. The even stronger Edmunds-Tucker Act, was enacted on March 3, 1887. Among other things, the acts required candidates and prospective voters to submit to an anti-polygamy oath. Enforcement of these bills furthermore put significant numbers of Latter-day Saint polygamists into federal prisons, including one built in Sugar House specifically for that purpose. The measures, which often brought punishment on anyone unwilling to take the oath, intimidated and decimated the Latter-day Saint voter pool.
The Liberal Party swept the city government of Ogden, Utah in 1889 but did not succeed in carrying the Weber County government. In 1890, the Liberal Party took Salt Lake City, and George M. Scott became the first non-Mormon mayor of Salt Lake, by a margin of 808 votes. Two years later, long-time Liberal stalwart R. N. Baskin became mayor on a &quot;fusion ticket&quot; between moderate Liberals and elements of the old People&#x27;s Party.

Propelled by success in Salt Lake City and Ogden, the Liberal Party won a third of the Utah territorial legislature in the August 1891 election. That election proved particularly notable, as the People&#x27;s Party had disbanded just prior to the election and urged all members to join national parties. Thus, non-Mormon Liberals ran (and several won) against mostly-Mormon Democrats and Republicans.

==Disbanding==
However, the Liberal Party had reached its twilight. In September 1890, the LDS Church issued the so-called 1890 Manifesto, which promised to end the practice of polygamy. The national support that the Liberals previously enjoyed for opposing polygamy in Utah thus disappeared. In 1893, all polygamists were given executive pardon, and statehood for Utah seemed imminent. Polygamy, often the focus of Liberal scorn, made the party irrelevant when Mormons abandoned the practice.

Following the lead of the People&#x27;s Party 18 months earlier, most members of the Liberal Party joined national parties in early 1893 in anticipation of Utah statehood.

On January 4, 1896, Utah became the 45th state in the Union. Former Liberals continued to be involved in politics, and most of the Mormon majority continued to view them unfavorably.

The &quot;Deseret Evening News&quot; and other LDS papers characterized Liberal Party governments as wasteful. The party outspent revenue in Tooele, Ogden, and Salt Lake City, accumulating relatively large public debts. However, the Liberal Party characterized its expenditures as essential for civic improvements. In Salt Lake City, the Liberals constructed the city&#x27;s first sewer, called the &quot;gravity sewer,&quot; which the &quot;Deseret News&quot; characterized as graft. The Salt Lake Liberals also constructed an ornate and expensive joint Salt Lake City and County Building. Former Liberals such as Baskin defended the reputation and legacy of the Liberal Party well into the 20th century.

<doc id="1094712" wikidata="Q7735286" url="?curid=1094712" title="The Friday Project">
<text>The Friday Project was a London-based independent publishing house, founded by Paul Carr and Clare Christian in June 2004. It evolved out of &quot;The Friday Thing&quot;, an Internet newsletter taking an offbeat look at the week&#x27;s politics, media activities and general current events, originally written together with Charlie Skelton.

The Project was wholly concerned with finding material on the web and then turning it into traditional books, to the exclusion of normal publishing models. Additionally, they made a large amount of their output available free to download as part of the Creative Commons license. 

==History==
In 2006, The Friday Project announced that it had hired Scott Pack, then Buying Manager at bookshop chain Waterstones, as TFP&#x27;s Commercial Director. Pack took up the post in September 2006 at the end of a six-month notice period. In his job at Waterstones, Pack was once described by a newspaper as being seen by &#x27;many&#x27; otherwise unidentified people as &#x27;the most powerful man in the books trade&#x27; for his ability to decide which new titles will be successful.

The Friday Project also have an audio arm which is responsible for the CD Fitness to Practice by Amateur Transplants. The album includes the internet hit London Underground which has spawned a popular viral video.

During 2006, The Friday Project&#x27;s Commercial Director Scott Pack courted controversy with his Me and My Big Mouth blog. Positioned as an irreverent commentary on the UK book trade it sparked a number of national press stories and was highly critical of lead retailers Waterstones and W H Smith. He also launched personal attacks on journalists he claimed had reported on his time at Waterstones incorrectly. These included Nick Cohen, Norman Lebrecht and D. J. Taylor.

In December 2006, it was reported that Carr – along with Online Editor, Graham Pond – had left The Friday Project with Carr leading a buy-out of the company&#x27;s Internet media arm to create a new company, Friday Cities.

In 2007, Clare Christian announced the launch of Friday Fiction, a new imprint for original fiction discovered on the web.

In March 2007, The Friday Project was shortlisted for two industry awards (or Nibbies), one for Innovation in the Book Industry for their commitment to making their books available under a Creative Commons license and Managing Director Clare Christian was shortlisted for a second for the company in the category of UK Young Publisher of the Year.

On 1 May 2007, The Friday Project&#x27;s Managing Director Clare Christian won the Nibbie for UK Young Publisher of the Year.

===Liquidation and sale===
Following losses in excess of £1,700,000, the Friday Project went into liquidation on 30 March 2008.

After much speculation, in May 2008 HarperCollins UK bought certain assets of The Friday Project from its administrator, hiring Scott Pack and also Clare Christian (no longer employed by them), and taking on several front and backlist titles; the first title to be published under the new Friday Project imprint was the critically acclaimed novel &quot;The State of Me&quot; by Nasim Marie Jafry.

=== Closure ===
In 2014, the Bookseller magazine reported that Scott Pack was departing the Friday Project and that the imprint &quot;will now be wound down.&quot;

<doc id="1094714" wikidata="Q1584635" url="?curid=1094714" title="Landini cadence">
<text>A Landini cadence (Landini sixth or Landini sixth cadence), or under-third cadence, is a type of cadence, a technique in music composition, named after Francesco Landini (1325–1397), an influential Italian composer, in honor of his extensive use of the technique. The technique was used extensively in the 14th and early 15th century.

In a typical Medieval cadence, a major sixth musical interval is expanded to an octave by having each note move outwards one step. In Landini&#x27;s version, an escape tone in the upper voice narrows the interval briefly to a perfect fifth before the octave. There could also be an inner voice; in the example the inner voice would move from F to G, in the same rhythm as the lower voice.

Landini was not the first to use the cadence (Gherardello da Firenze appears to be the first whose works have survived), and was not the last: the cadence was still in use well into the 15th century, appearing particularly frequently in the songs of Gilles Binchois and in the music of Johannes Wreede. However, Landini seems to have been the first to use it consistently. The term was coined in the late 19th century by German writer A.G. Ritter (1884), in his &quot;Zur Geschichte des Orgelspiels&quot;, Leipzig.

<text>Tchin-Tchin, also known as Chin-Chin, is a Paris-based romantic comedy by François Billetdoux (1927–1991). Directed by François Darbon and designed by Francine Gaillard-Risler, it premiered at the Théâtre de Poche in Montparnasse, Paris, on January 26, 1959. The author himself played the role of Cesareo Grimaldi, and Katharina Renn played Pamela Pusey-Picq.

==UK and U.S. productions==
Adapted by Willis Hall as &quot;Chin-Chin&quot;, the play opened at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End on November 3, 1960, running until the following March with Celia Johnson and Anthony Quayle in the leads; directed by Howard Sackler, the production was designed by Sean Kenny. According to &quot;Theatre World&quot; editor Frances Stephens: &quot;There was a haunting quality about this new play … and Celia Johnson has done nothing better than her brilliant and sensitive portrayal of the inhibited Englishwoman who goes to pieces when her French doctor husband deserts her ... Anthony Quayle was also superb.&quot; In &quot;The Stage&quot;, R. B. Marriott pointed out that &quot;Celia Johnson had her finest part of recent years, and played it flawlessly, in &quot;Chin-Chin&quot; ... which, starting its run haltingly after a mixed reception, developed, I am glad to say, into a success.&quot; A different translation, by Mark Rudkin, was published in the UK by Secker and Warburg. This version transferred the setting, with Billetdoux&#x27;s blessing, from Paris to New York.

Adapted by Sidney Michaels as &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot;, the play opened on Broadway on October 25, 1962, at the Plymouth Theatre (later transferring to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre) and closing on May 18, 1963, after 225 performances. Directed by Peter Glenville, the play starred Margaret Leighton and Anthony Quinn, with Charles Grodin in a supporting role. Arlene Francis and Jack Klugman took over the star roles for the last month. &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot; received Tony Award nominations for Best Play, Best Actress in a Play (Leighton), Best Scenic Design (Will Steven Armstrong) and Best Direction of a Play. &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot; is magical. It is also fragile, but it is saved from wispiness by Leighton and Quinn. Excellence is an acting habit with Margaret Leighton, and her Pamela is expectably perfect. Anthony Quinn brings his subtlest gifts to Caesario [&quot;sic&quot;], a character in whom anguish and sentiment sprout like city flowers between slabs of concrete.&quot; 
In 2013, the Willis Hall version of &quot;Chin-Chin&quot; was revived with Felicity Kendal and Simon Callow, directed by Michael Rudman and designed by Michael Taylor. The first night was at the Theatre Royal Windsor, Berkshire, on 16 October prior to a UK tour.

==Plot==
Pamela and Cesareo&#x27;s respective spouses are having an affair. When they discover this, they meet. The initially priggish English lady is slowly seduced by the vibrant Italian. Unfortunately, his joie-de-vivre is mainly due to alcohol and she too becomes dependent on it, initiating a decline and fall.

==Film==
&quot;A Fine Romance&quot; (1991) with Julie Andrews and Marcello Mastroianni, directed by Gene Saks and adapted by Ronald Harwood.

<doc id="1094719" wikidata="Q310204" url="?curid=1094719" title="The Grudge">
<text>The Grudge is a 2004 American supernatural horror film directed by Takashi Shimizu, written by Stephen Susco, and produced by Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, and Takashige Ichise. A remake of Shimizu&#x27;s 2002 Japanese horror film &quot;Ju-On: The Grudge&quot;, it is the first installment in &quot;The Grudge&quot; film series. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason Behr, KaDee Strickland, Clea DuVall, and Bill Pullman. Takako Fuji, Yuya Ozeki, and Takashi Matsuyama portray the characters Kayako Saeki, Toshio Saeki, and Takeo Saeki from the original films. The plot is told through a nonlinear sequence of events and includes several intersecting subplots.

&quot;The Grudge&quot; was released in North America by Sony Pictures Releasing on October 22, 2004, and grossed $187.3 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==

The Grudge is a curse, born when someone dies in extreme rage or sorrow and lingers where the person dies. Those who encounter it will die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless growing chain of horror.

In 2001, Kayako Saeki, a housewife in Tokyo, is in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in a diary. Her jealous husband Takeo discovers the diary and believes Kayako is having an affair. In a fit of rage, he brutally murders her, their young son Toshio, and their pet cat Mar. After Takeo hides the bodies in the house, Kayako&#x27;s ghost hangs him with her hair. After receiving a letter from Kayako, Peter visits the Saeki house only to find her and Takeo&#x27;s corpses and Toshio&#x27;s ghost. Shocked and horrified, he flees the scene and commits suicide the next day. The remainder of the Saeki family rises again as restless ghosts due to the curse, notably Kayako, who appears as an &quot;onryō&quot;.

In 2004, the Williams family from America moved into the Saeki house for Matt&#x27;s job. While Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable, the former experiencing culture shock and feeling lost as she can&#x27;t speak Japanese, and the latter sensing that something is wrong with the house. The curse quickly consumes Matt and Jennifer. Matt&#x27;s sister Susan is also haunted as the curse follows her back into her apartment. Yoko, a care worker, arrives at the house to find Emma alone before she encounters Kayako, who drags her up into the attic. Concerned about Yoko&#x27;s disappearance, her employer, Alex, sends another care worker, Karen Davis, to take over the care of Emma. Karen discovers Toshio sealed up in a wardrobe at the house and later witnesses Kayako&#x27;s spirit descending from the ceilings to claim Emma.

Alex arrives at the house and finds Emma dead and Karen in shock. He calls the police, who come with Detective Nakagawa. In the attic, Nakagawa and his partner Igarashi find Matt and Jennifer&#x27;s bodies, along with a human&#x27;s lower jaw. Meanwhile, Susan is pursued by Kayako around her office building. At home, Kayako attacks her, and she vanishes. While leaving work, Alex is killed by Yoko&#x27;s jawless corpse. Kayako begins haunting Karen, who informs her boyfriend, Doug, of the situation.

Karen researches the house, eventually confronting Nakagawa, who explains that the curse consumed three of his colleagues investigating the Saeki deaths. That night, Nakagawa carries gasoline into the house to burn it down but is killed by Takeo. Karen races there after learning Doug has ventured to the Saeki house to look for her. She finds Doug paralyzed and attempts to flee with him. Kayako crawls down the stairs and latches onto Doug, who dies of shock. As Kayako closes in, Karen sees the gasoline and ignites it. Karen survives, and in the hospital, she learns that the house also survived the fire. Visiting Doug&#x27;s body, Karen realizes that Kayako still haunts her.

==Cast==

==Production==
Takashi Shimizu, the director and creator of the original film, was hired to direct &quot;The Grudge&quot;, from a screenplay by Stephen Susco. Sam Raimi produced through its Ghost House Pictures banner, alongside Robert Tapert and Takashige Ichise. Principal photography on the film began on January 26, 2004, with reshoots occurring in July 2004 in Tokyo, Japan. Sarah Michelle Gellar filmed her scenes in Tokyo within three months before returning for the reshoots.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Grudge&quot; was theatrically released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 22, 2004, and opened at 3,348 theaters. The film generated $39.1 million in ticket sales in its first weekend (October 22–24), exceeding the expectations of box-office analysts and Sony Pictures executives. Ticket sales declined 43% on the second weekend, earning $21.8 million. It grossed $110.4 million in the United States and Canada, with $76.9 in other territories, for worldwide total of $187.3 million.

===Home media===
&quot;The Grudge&quot; was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on VHS, DVD, and UMD on February 1, 2005. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the US on May 24, 2009. The film made $9.24 million from DVD sales in its first week, debuting at #2 in the sales chart behind &quot;Ray&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four, writing &quot;I&#x27;m not sure how most of the scenes fit into the movie. I do, however, understand the underlying premise: There is a haunted house, and everybody who enters it will have unspeakable things happen to them.&quot; He criticized the fragmented time structure and said he &quot;eventually lost all patience&quot;. Brian Rentschler of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; gave an overall positive review but in the end, unfavorably compared the film to &quot;The Ring&quot;, writing: &quot;Writer/director Takashi Shimizu (who also wrote and directed the original) does a decent job of setting the mood of the film and (to a lesser extent) developing the storyline, but to be so similar to a movie that came out only two years ago... it&#x27;s a tough obstacle to overcome.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;A convoluted plot makes it hard for the viewer to track the action and to become involved with any of the characters, including Gellar&#x27;s perfectly nice, perfectly ordinary student. This makes it all the harder to go along with all the haunted house horrors that ensnare her&quot;. He ended his review with, &quot;&quot;The Grudge&quot; is a fairly faithful adaptation of Shimizu&#x27;s &quot;Ju-On&quot;, which in turn was based on his direct-to-video version, which in turn also spawned a direct-to-video sequel. More than anything, &quot;The Grudge&quot; suggests that it&#x27;s time for Shimizu to move on&quot;. Scott Foundas from &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Project might have been more successful if Shimizu had style and/or atmosphere to substitute for his canned scares, cardboard compositions and flaccid cutting&quot;.

<text>Miramonte High School is a four-year public high school located in Orinda, California, United States. It is part of the Acalanes Union High School District. The school has a college-preparatory program, with 15 Advanced Placement courses offered.

== History ==

Miramonte was founded in 1955, and welcomed approximately 175 students in September of that year. The third school in the district, MHS was built in an old pear orchard off of Moraga Way, south of the Orinda Crossroads.

The initial construction of Miramonte High School was completed by Pacific Coast Builders of San Francisco, whose bid of $559,100 was accepted by the Acalanes High School District Board of Trustees in September 1954. The site originally included 10 classrooms, a gymnasium, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; locker rooms, a paved driveway, a paved outdoor athletic field and track, and a parking area. 

== Athletics ==
Miramonte football recorded their first NCS CIF championship in 1981, defeating San Lorenzo 23–7 in the Oakland Coliseum.

In 1972 and 1973, The Miramonte Matador Football team won the Foothill Athletic League Championship both years. The 1973 team went on to beat Antioch High School in the &quot;Turkey Bowl&quot; to end the bowl season as the East Bay Area&#x27;s #1 Ranked Championship Football Team. The 1972 Miramonte team also played against Antioch the previous year in the Turkey Bowl and lost.

In 1983, the Miramonte Matadors, known as the Mats, were voted CIF State Champions in all divisions after defeating Cardinal Newman High School on December 3, 1983, at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in the NCS 2A Championship game. The Mats were also NCS 2A South Champions and FAL Champions.

In 1997, the Mats again won the NCS 2A Championship after defeating Granada High School in the championship game at the Oakland Coliseum. The Mats also won NCS 2A titles in 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2003 in their victory over San Lorenzo in a rematch of their 1981 championship game.

In 2013, after finishing 2nd in the DFAL, the Mats defeated Tennyson, Northgate and number two-seeded Clayton Valley Charter to reach the championship at Rancho Cotate High School against 13–0 Casa Grande. In the game, Miramonte scored two touchdowns in the last two minutes to win their 8th NCS football championship, 42–28 to finish 12–2 on the season.

In 2008–09, Miramonte&#x27;s water polo team was named &quot;2008-09 ESPN RISE Magazine Boys&#x27; Team of the Year&quot; (includes all sports). Since 1967, the team has won 15 NOR CAL championships and 26 League Championships. The so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; were the California State Champions that year.

== Academics ==

In 2012, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Miramonte High School as #21 in California and #126 in the United States in their rankings of the Best High Schools. 

In 2021, Miramonte was ranked 571 nationally, and slipped from the top school in the county to third place. For their 2023-2024 Best High Schools Rankings (released in August of 2023) U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Miramonte as #217 nationally, and second in the county.

As of March 2014, Miramonte ranked 11th on the Los Angeles Times California Schools Guide Top Average SAT Scores list.

<doc id="1094723" wikidata="Q7739979" url="?curid=1094723" title="The Hollow Tree">
<text>The Hollow Tree is a 1997 children&#x27;s historical novel by Canadian author Janet Lunn. The book is the third in a trilogy, the first two being &quot;The Root Cellar&quot; and &quot;Shadow in Hawthorn Bay&quot;. Having progressed backward from the American Civil War in &quot;The Root Cellar&quot;, another few decades in &quot;Shadow in Hawthorn Bay&quot;, &quot;The Hollow Tree&quot; takes place during the starting of the American Revolution in 1777. 

The main character, Phoebe Olcott, is mentioned briefly in &quot;Shadow in Hawthorn Bay&quot; as &quot;Phoebe Morrisay,&quot; having married Jem Morrisay. Phoebe&#x27;s suitor, Ben Larkin, is implied to be an ancestor to Rose Larkin, the protagonist of &quot;The Root Cellar&quot;, while the Morrissay family&#x27;s descendants would include Will Morrisay, who also appears in &quot;The Root Cellar&quot;.

==Plot overview==
Plump little Phoebe Olcott is a timid but helpful 15-year-old girl, admired by her father&#x27;s students for her quiet temperament and stubbornness. After her father, a schoolteacher, is killed in action while fighting as an American Patriot (commonly known as Rebels) in the quick revolution, she ends up living with her aunt&#x27;s family, who happen to be Loyalist.

Phoebe continues to hide in the shadows of her cousins Gideon and Anne Robinson until Gideon becomes a British soldier. When he is suddenly found hanged, Phoebe discovers that Gideon was actually a spy and finds a list of names that was entrusted to Gideon and must be delivered to Fort Ticonderoga.

She arrives at Fort Ticonderoga too late; the post has been abandoned. Instead, she finds a bear and a cat and meets Jem Morrissay, whose family happens to be one of the names on the list entrusted to Gideon. Phoebe and Jem form an uneasy relationship and she is reunited with her family and several other Loyalist families fleeing to Upper Canada to avoid persecution by the Patriots.

During the flight of the Loyalists, they capture Japhet Oram, a Loyalist soldier, and are uncertain if he is a deserter or a rebel spy. The leader of the group insists that the soldier be taken to Canada and hanged. When Phoebe&#x27;s own convictions, background, and morals clash with the more radical of the Loyalists, she soon finds herself isolated from the rest of the group. She secretly cuts Japhet loose and runs away, but is pursued by Jem.

Despite their growing attraction to one another, Phoebe refuses to return to the other Loyalists with Jem. Forced to continue alone, Phoebe begins her dangerous journey to Canada in order to escape the revolution and fulfil Gideon&#x27;s final mission.

<doc id="1094728" wikidata="Q2454946" url="?curid=1094728" title="Oregon Route 126">
<text>Oregon OR 126 (OR 126) is a state highway that connects coastal, western, and central parts of the U.S. state of Oregon. A short freeway section of OR 126 in Eugene and Springfield is concurrent with Interstate 105 (I-105).

==Route description==

===Florence to Eugene===

The western terminus of OR 126 is in Florence at a junction with US 101, the main north–south route along the Oregon Coast. The junction is located north of downtown Florence near the municipal airport and the mouth of the Siuslaw River, which empties into the nearby Pacific Ocean. OR 126 travels east on the Florence-Eugene Highway No. 62 (see Oregon highways and routes), which follows the Siuslaw River and the Coos Bay Rail Line out of Florence and into the Siuslaw National Forest and the foothills of the Coast Range. The highway turns north along a bend in the river to reach Mapleton, where it intersects OR 36 and leaves the river and railroad for Knowles Creek. OR 126 continues east along the creek to the Ralph A. Petersen Tunnel, a long tunnel that opened in 1957.

From the tunnel, the highway descends from the mountains along Turner Creek to briefly rejoin the Siuslaw River and the Coos Bay Rail Line. OR 126 and the railroad split from the river to follow Wildcat Creek northeast to Cougar Pass, which marks the boundary between the Siuslaw and Willamette river basins. The highway descends into the Willamette Valley and passes through the town of Veneta and along the south shore of the Fern Ridge Reservoir. It also joins a section of the Coos Bay Rail Line as it approaches Eugene.

In the western outskirts of Eugene, OR 126 intersects OR 569, which forms a northern bypass of Eugene. The highway follows Amazon Creek on West 11th Avenue towards downtown Eugene, turning north onto Garfield Street for five blocks. It then becomes concurrent with OR 99, which travels through downtown Eugene on a pair of one-way streets: West 7th Avenue for eastbound traffic and West 6th Avenue for westbound traffic. At a junction with Washington and Jefferson streets, OR 126 turns north onto a freeway, which is designated as Interstate 105 (I-105).

In January 2016, the Oregon Legislature passed SB 5, designating OR 126 between Florence and Eugene as &quot;William Tebeau Memorial Highway,&quot; named after a pioneering ODOT engineer.

===Freeway section===

At the junction with Washington and Jefferson streets in downtown Eugene lies the western terminus of Eugene-Springfield Highway No. 227, an east-west freeway through the Eugene-Springfield metropolitan area. OR 126 is routed along this freeway for its entire length, and I-105 is routed along the first until the interchange with I-5.

The bridge and viaduct carrying the first of I-105 are sometimes known as the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge. After crossing the Willamette River, passing two exits, and entering Springfield, I-105 ends at an interchange with I-5, and OR 126 continues east then turning south, with the freeway terminating at Main Street (OR 126 Business) in the Thurston neighborhood of the city&#x27;s east end.

In December 2011 the section of highway from the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge to Springfield was renamed Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway to commemorate the fallen Eugene Police Department officer who was fatally wounded while conducting a traffic stop on the highway in April 2011.

===Springfield to Prineville===

OR 126 continues east as McKenzie Highway No. 15 and the McKenzie River Scenic Byway, flanking the McKenzie River for most of its length from Springfield into the Cascade Range. It turns north at Belknap Springs and follows the Clear Lake–Belknap Springs Highway No. 215, passing the eponymous Clear Lake. The highway merges with US 20 near Crescent Mountain and begins a concurrency that continues through Santiam Junction (the terminus of OR 22) and Sisters as Santiam Highway No. 16. OR 242 is an alternative route between Belknap Springs and Sisters that travels between Mount Washington and the Three Sisters.

East of Sisters, OR 126 splits from US 20 (which turns southeast towards Bend) and continues east onto the Sisters-Redmond Highway and resumes its designation as McKenzie Highway No. 15. The highway crosses Deschutes River and travels through Redmond, where it is briefly concurrent with US 97&#x27;s bypass of the city. OR 126 travels southeast on Ochoco Highway No. 41 from Redmond, passing its commercial airport, to reach its eastern terminus at U.S. Route 26 (US 26) in Prineville.

==History==
In 1926, the route between Florence and Ontario was designated as US 28. The Junction City-Florence section of the highway ran roughly along what are now OR 36 and OR 126.

In 1937, the same year a new US 99 alignment between Eugene and Junction City opened, US 28 was truncated and its western terminus moved to Glenwood (between Eugene and Springfield).

On February 1, 1952, US 28 was eliminated from the United States Numbered Highway System. The highway was redesignated US 26 between the Oregon-Idaho border and Prineville (and then continuing north and west through Portland to Astoria). The former US 28 section between Prineville and Eugene was then designated U.S. Route 126.

In 1957 the long-awaited direct route between Eugene and the coast, known as &quot;Route F&quot;, was completed. It was primarily funded by the Lane County government with assistance from the federal government, with the goal of bypassing the longer Stagecoach Road. It was proposed as early as the 1930s. The Knowles Creek tunnel was opened to traffic on June 4, 1957, and was later renamed for Ralph A. Petersen, a Lane County commissioner who had lobbied for the highway&#x27;s construction. The state of Oregon formally named the new route the Eugene-Mapleton Highway, but did not assign it a route number until 1964, when it became OR 126. Highway authorities agreed to the duplication as a temporary one, as US 126 would soon disappear under the ongoing elimination of three-digit U.S. Routes lying entirely within one state.

A freeway bypass of OR 126 in Downtown Eugene, named the Q Street Freeway, was planned in the late 1950s and incorporated into the Interstate Highway System as I-105. Initial plans called for its route to follow Q Street from Coburg Road in Eugene (near the Delta Highway) to Mill Street in northern Springfield, with further extensions at both ends. The freeway would reach Downtown Eugene by following the Washington and Jefferson Street Bridge over the Willamette River, which had already been planned by the city government. An eastern extension to Highway 126 near Springfield was also planned by the state government, but Lane County officials requested a longer route to avoid more of Springfield. The completed Eugene section of I-105 was dedicated by Governor Tom McCall on October 25, 1967, along with improvements to US 126 in Springfield.

In 1972, the American Association of State Highway Officials dropped US 126 from its highway system. The state of Oregon promptly redesignated the Prineville-Eugene section of the former U.S. Route, and the Mapleton-Florence section of OR 36, as OR 126.

The routes of OR 126 and its predecessors have changed numerous times over the years. The original route of US 28 from Florence to Eugene ran through Junction City, and overlapped US 99 (now OR 99) from there south to Eugene. The route between Junction City and Brickerville is now OR 36; the original route of US 28 west of Brickerville is no longer on the state highway system.

In 1972, US 126 was eliminated and OR 126 through the Eugene-Springfield area was routed onto a newly constructed freeway through north and east Springfield, and then the older I-105 at Eugene. The portions of the former US 126 rolling through downtown Springfield and Eugene were designated as the OR 126 business route.

The place where OR 126 and its predecessors cross the Cascades has changed over the years. Originally, the highway was routed over McKenzie Pass, a high mountainous route that frequently was closed in winter due to poor road conditions. In 1962, the Clear Lake Cutoff was constructed between Clear Lake and Belknap Springs, connecting the McKenzie Highway to the Santiam Highway (US 20) to the north. US 126 was re-routed over the cutoff and ran concurrently with US 20 east over the Cascades to Sisters, where it resumes its original course. The stretch of the McKenzie Highway between Belknap Springs and Sisters is now designated as OR 242. OR 242 is primarily a scenic route and is not plowed in wintertime.

===Proposed expansions===
Currently, the route of Oregon OR 126 through western Eugene runs along several surface streets, most notably including West 11th Avenue. This route is well known in the Eugene area for traffic problems. Several projects have been proposed to deal with this; however, none has met with community approval.

A new proposed alignment of OR 126, the &quot;West Eugene Parkway&quot; is being planned by transportation authorities (but is facing fierce opposition from activists opposed to the parkway). The proposed parkway, a limited-access expressway with some at-grade intersections and some interchanges, would run north of the current West 11th alignment. Transportation planners have argued that the new route is necessary to fight congestion in Eugene and its western suburbs and that the highway would facilitate traffic and growth in the year 2025. Highway opponents note that world petroleum supplies will likely be in decline long before the road would be completed, and therefore modest fixes to existing roads would be sufficient.

The Roosevelt Freeway was a freeway proposed in the 1960s and planned in the 1970s, which would serve as a new alignment of OR 126 through west Eugene. It was cancelled in 1978 due to community opposition.

Construction on the parkway was set to begin in 2006 though land-use appeals and lack of funding delayed and ultimately prevented groundbreaking on the project.

====Roosevelt Freeway====
The Roosevelt Freeway was a proposed freeway alignment of OR 126 through Eugene, Oregon and its western suburbs. The project was canceled in 1972, largely due to the Oregon freeway revolts.

The freeway was proposed to go north of the current OR 126 alignment along West 11th Avenue, Roosevelt Boulevard and the Willamette River near the Whitaker neighborhood, and connect to the current I-105 just south of the Washington-Jefferson Street Bridge. (A proposed eastward extension of the project, the Skinner Butte Freeway, never made it off the drawing board).

The freeway was designed to solve a longstanding traffic issue in Eugene, the inadequacy of West 11th Avenue (a neighborhood arterial) to handle long-haul and commuter traffic. Many commuters, as well as state transportation officials, strongly desired to build the freeway. Plans for the freeway were completed in the mid-1970s, and the state of Oregon had begun buying up property for the right-of-way. A ramp stub currently exists on I-105, where the interchange with the Roosevelt Freeway would have been.

However, the freeway proved to be unpopular with Eugene residents, due to its impact on existing neighborhoods and riverfront access. In 1978, the so-called &quot;T-2000&quot; transportation plan was adopted, which effectively killed the Roosevelt Freeway by removing it from the plan&#x27;s list of transportation projects. The plan did call for an east–west corridor through west Eugene, but for a scaled-down version. The mothballed West Eugene Parkway, a non-freeway route on a similar alignment, was seen by supporters and critics alike as an implementation of these plans.

====West Eugene Parkway====

The West Eugene Parkway, or WEP, was a proposed re-alignment of OR 126 through the western parts of Eugene and its suburbs. OR 126 runs through west Eugene along several surface streets, including West 11th Avenue, which is well known for its traffic problems. The proposed route, a limited-access expressway with some at-grade intersections and one interchange, would have run north of the current West 11th alignment, terminating at the western terminus of the Sixth-Seventh Avenue couplet carrying OR 99 through west Eugene. The project proved to be highly controversial. In July 2006, ODOT suspended work on it, and recommended a no-build alternative to the Federal Highway Administration.

Transportation planners argued that the new route is necessary to fight traffic congestion in Eugene and its western suburbs and that the highway would facilitate traffic and growth in the year 2025.

Opponents to the parkway have several reasons for their objection:
* The route is not needed; further road construction is a symptom of urban sprawl and better land use planning is the solution
* The route will encourage further development and urban sprawl in west Eugene
* World petroleum supplies will likely be in decline long before the road would be completed, and therefore modest fixes to existing roads would be sufficient
* The proposed route will disrupt environmentally-sensitive areas, including wetlands near the proposed alignment
* The parkway is just a resurrection of the old Roosevelt Freeway proposal (canceled in 1972), and calling the proposed project a &quot;parkway&quot; is deceptive
* The proposed route will just dump more traffic in Eugene&#x27;s downtown core. The project fails the federally mandated &quot;independent utility&quot; test, and is thus illegal, because public transportation projects must be self-standing, according to federal law. It is alleged that construction of the parkway will raise traffic on Sixth and Seventh Avenues to unacceptable levels, requiring construction of a new highway through downtown. If such a design element was included in the current plan, such inclusion would likely lead to its cancellation.
* Funds spent on the project (officially $169 million) would be better spent on other improvements to the area transportation network.
* Over the past 20 years Eugene City Planning required businesses build along the West 11th corridor to place their parking lots &quot;behind&quot; their buildings, resulting in many buildings erected close to the existing street. Construction of the proposed parkway would require widening of the current road, forcing many of these businesses to close or relocate. Consequently, the project was opposed by many business owners along the route.

On June 18 and 19, 2001, the City of Eugene, Lane County, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), among others, held a two-day &quot;West Eugene Charrette&quot; to discuss the future of the project. Most participants were supporters of the highway, but at the end of the conference agreed to select the &quot;no-build&quot; option. This consensus was not implemented, although ODOT and FHWA continued to spend millions, for a time, on the environmental impact statement.

Supporters, and the government agencies involved in the planning of the project, pointed to the fact that the parkway proposal has been approved by city voters in two referendum elections, most recently in 2001. Opponents note that the election was 51 to 49, and that proponents claimed &quot;The Money Is There&quot; when selling the project. The official price tag for the WEP was $88 million in 2001, but a 2004 estimate by local and state governments predicts the cost is really $169 million. Few WEP proponents support tax increases to pay for the highway.

On October 26, 2005, the Eugene City Council voted 5-4 to withdraw the city&#x27;s support for the project, although the City of Eugene has continued its agreement with ODOT to assume responsibility for maintaining part of the road. The city also owns the property for the parkway that has not yet been transferred to the BLM nature preserve for conservation and restoration.

In July 2006, ODOT withdrew its support of the project, effectively stopping further progress.

==Business route==
OR 126 Business is a state business route of OR 126 that travels for through the central districts of Eugene and Springfield. It also forms the westernmost part of McKenzie Highway No. 15 under Oregon&#x27;s named highways system. At the western terminus of I-105, OR 126 heads west on Sixth Avenue (cosigned with OR 99). From that same terminus, Business OR 126 heads east, also cosigned with OR 99, along Seventh Avenue. This route then proceeds through Eugene&#x27;s downtown core and turns south at an interchange near the Ferry Street Bridge.

After two blocks, Business OR 126/OR 99 turns east again on East Broadway, which becomes Franklin Boulevard at Alder Street. Franklin Boulevard separates the south shore of the Willamette River from the northern edge of the University of Oregon campus.

Past the university campus and surrounding business district, Business OR 126 and OR 99 split. OR 99 joins southbound I-5, while OR 126 continues eastbound through the community of Glenwood. It then crosses the Willamette River and enters the city of Springfield. Business OR 126 continues east through downtown Springfield, eventually rejoining the main stem of OR 126 in the Thurston neighborhood of the city&#x27;s east end.

==Major intersections==

<text>The Man from Another Place (played by Michael J. Anderson), also known as The Arm, is a character from the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. He is an inhabitant of the Black Lodge, a realm of pure evil. He was created from MIKE&#x27;s severed left arm. Early on in the series, The Man gives Agent Dale Cooper clues to apprehending The Man&#x27;s nemesis, BOB. He later makes recurring appearances in relation to the Black Lodge.

==&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991)==
The Man from Another Place first appears in the series&#x27; third episode, in a dream experienced by Cooper. Although a spirit, he appears to Cooper as a dwarf in a red suit and dress shirt. In the dream, The Man gives Cooper a series of cryptic clues, which ultimately prove helpful in determining the identity of Laura Palmer&#x27;s killer, The Man&#x27;s fellow Black Lodge spirit, BOB. One of these clues is a strange 1940s-style jazz dance, a sequence that makes repeated appearances throughout the course of the series. The series never made clear The Man&#x27;s reasons for wanting to help Cooper, or his true identity.

Following Cooper&#x27;s dream, The Man appears only a few more times: once with BOB, appearing to Cooper following the death of Josie Packard, and again at the end of the series when Cooper ventures into the Black Lodge.

==&quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992)==

The film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; expands upon The Man from Another Place&#x27;s identity and his reasons for wanting to help Cooper. It explains that The Man from Another Place is connected to MIKE, the faceless spirit entity who possesses Philip Gerard, the &quot;One Armed Man&quot;. The script explicitly states that the Man from Another Place is, in fact, MIKE&#x27;s severed arm. In the series, the one-armed Gerard tells Cooper a story about having been BOB&#x27;s partner until he cut off his own arm in an effort to relieve himself of a tattoo on the left shoulder that BOB also had. In &quot;Fire Walk With Me&quot;, The Man from Another Place tells Cooper, &quot;I am the Arm, and I sound like this.&quot; He then makes a whooping noise with his hand and mouth. Later, a similar-sounding siren accompanies the first appearance of Gerard.
At the climax of the film, BOB enters the Black Lodge and stands beside his host, Leland Palmer. The Man From Another Place also appears, standing beside Philip Gerard. At one point The Man From Another Place puts his hand on Gerard&#x27;s shoulder, linking the Arm with its owner and making MIKE whole. The Man from Another Place and MIKE then speak in unison to BOB, stating &quot;I want all my garmonbozia&quot; (&quot;pain and sorrow&quot;, collected from victims and consumed in the Black Lodge). BOB then removes blood from Leland’s shirt and throws it to the ground. The Man from Another Place is then seen slowly eating creamed corn, interspersed with close-up night vision footage of a monkey staring into the camera, which appears to be the same type of monkey as was earlier shown behind a mask of the type worn by other Lodge spirits (Mrs. Tremond&#x27;s grandson and the &quot;Jumping Man&quot;).

==&quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017)==

Attempts to bring Anderson back for the third season broke down over compensation. Instead the character appears as a talking luminescent tree, introduced as &quot;the evolution of the arm&quot;. When asked whether the organic mass atop the tree was &quot;a talking brain, pituitary gland, or neuron&quot;, Lynch replied, 
&quot;It&#x27;s just a head.&quot; In the second episode, the tree warns Cooper about its doppelgänger, who appears and attacks Cooper, causing him to fall through the floor of the Black Lodge. In the seventh episode, Cooper has a helpful vision of the tree in plain daylight, while he attempts to disarm a criminal.

== Reverse speech ==
The strange cadence of the Man&#x27;s dialogue was achieved by having Anderson speak into a recorder. This was then played in reverse, and Anderson was directed to repeat the reversed original. This &quot;reverse-speech&quot; was then reversed again in editing to bring it back to the normal direction, a technique called phonetic reversal. This created the strange rhythm and accentuation that set Cooper&#x27;s dream world apart from the real world.

Anderson recalls that the phonetic reversal was not difficult to master as, coincidentally, he had used it as a secret language with his junior high school friends. Series creator David Lynch was unaware of this when he cast Anderson in the part, and had hired a trainer to help Anderson with enunciation. When he found out Anderson could already talk backwards, he cancelled the trainer and wrote more difficult lines of dialogue for Anderson to read.

<text>Abutilon&quot; × &quot;hybridum is a species name used for a wide variety of different types flowering plants of uncertain origin in the genus &quot;Abutilon&quot;. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the name, they are often considered a cultivar group: Abutilon x Hybridum Group or Abutilon Hybridum Group. They are cultigens, not occurring in the wild. As with the larger genus &quot;Abutilon&quot; generally, they have been referred to by the common names Chinese lantern, and parlour maple.
==Description==
No reliable source has settled the question of parentage for these plants, and they have been variously said to perhaps derive from the species &quot;Abutilon theophrasti&quot;, &quot;A. striatum&quot;, &quot;A. darwinii&quot;, &quot;A. pictum&quot;, or any of the South American species.

Descriptions vary widely; some sources have described them as short as 
&quot;1 to 2 ½&#x27; tall&quot;, while others list them as reaching 15&#x27; in height.

<doc id="1094748" wikidata="Q1238921" url="?curid=1094748" title="George Pomutz">
<text>George Pomutz (in Romanian: Gheorghe Pomuț, in Hungarian: Pomucz György or Pomutz György; May 31, 1818 – October 12, 1882) was a Romanian-American officer during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 against the Habsburgs, a general in the Union Army in the American Civil War, a lawyer, and a diplomat.

==Early life==
George Pomutz was born in the Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire, in the town of Gyula (Romanian: &quot;Giula&quot;), Békés county, to ethnic Romanian orthodox parents Ioan (son of Dica, metalsmith) and Victoria, the family originally from Négyfalu (Săcele, Siebendörfer), near Brassó (Brașov, Kronstadt) in Transylvania, settling in Gyula during the second half of the 18th century. His baptism record was registered under no. 63 at the Romanian orthodox church Sfântul Nicolae, located in Miklosvaros (Nagy román város / Big Romanian town), situated in the NE part of Gyula; it also notes that a copy of this document was solicited and obtained from the church on June 27, 1857. He received his primary and secondary education in Hungary, followed by the Military Academy in Vienna and Military Academy Saint Etienne (France). He spoke about 5-6 language and later specialized in France where he became a royal prosecutor. He served as a captain in the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Afterwards, in 1849, he emigrated to the United States; arriving in New York on February 24, 1850, alongside 20 acquaintances. The group of immigrants, Romanians and Hungarians, settled around the town of Keokuk, Iowa, founding a settlement named New Buda located south of the town of Burlington. George Pomutz became a U.S. citizen on March 15, 1855. He purchased land and a mining concession, the 1860 U.S. Census finding him living in Decatur, Iowa.

==Civil War==
At the beginning of the Civil War, Pomutz enrolled in the Union Army as a first lieutenant in the 15th Iowa Infantry Regiment. He was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. In May 1864, after Pomutz had commanded the provisional Iowa Battalion, Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair appointed Pomutz as Provost Marshal of his XVII Corps. In August 1864, Pomutz returned to the 15th Iowa Infantry, which he commanded in the Battle of Atlanta.

On May 4, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Pomutz for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 18, 1866.

==Postbellum career==
After the end of the Civil War, Pomutz returned to Keokuk. On February 16, 1866, he was appointed Consul of the United States in Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, serving in that capacity until September 30, 1870. During that period, he was involved in the negotiations for the Alaska Purchase. Later he became the American consul general in Saint Petersburg, serving from June 17, 1874, until his death there, in 1882. He was buried in Smolensky Cemetery, Saint Petersburg, Russia but his grave seems to have disappeared, possibly after the re-purposing of cemetery lands by the Bolsheviks, after the 1917 Russian Revolution.

==Legacy==
The Liberty ship SS &quot;George Pomutz&quot; was named after him. Launched August 3, 1944, the ship served till 1970.

On August 14, 2004, a statue of Pomutz was unveiled at the Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral in Cleveland, Ohio.

A street in Timișoara, Romania bears his name.

<doc id="1094752" wikidata="Q1031386" url="?curid=1094752" title="Russian Ground Forces">
<text>The Russian Ground Forces (), also known as the Russian Army in English, are the land forces of the Russian Armed Forces.

The primary responsibilities of the Russian Ground Forces are the protection of the state borders, combat on land, and the defeat of enemy troops.
The President of Russia is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces is the chief commanding authority of the Russian Ground Forces. He is appointed by the President of Russia. The Main Command of the Ground Forces is based in Moscow.

== Mission ==

The primary responsibilities of the Russian Ground Forces are the protection of the state borders, combat on land, the security of occupied territories, and the defeat of enemy troops. The Ground Forces must be able to achieve these goals both in nuclear war and non-nuclear war, especially without the use of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, they must be capable of protecting the national interests of Russia within the framework of its international obligations.

The Main Command of the Ground Forces is officially tasked with the following objectives:
* the training of troops for combat, on the basis of tasks determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation
* the improvement of troops&#x27; structure and composition, and the optimization of their numbers, including for Specialised Troops (:ru:Специальные войска, a term covering several combat service support branches such as Engineers; Russian Signal Troops; Chemical; Motor Transport; Russian Railway Troops, and Road Troops [construction])
* the development of military theory and practice
* the development and introduction of training field manuals, tactics, and methodology
* the improvement of operational and combat training of the Ground Forces

It should be clearly noted that Spetsnaz GRU, most special forces, are under the control of the Main Reconnaissance Directorate (GRU), now the Main Directorate of the General Staff.

== History ==
As the Soviet Union dissolved, efforts were made to keep the Soviet Armed Forces as a single military structure for the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The last Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, was appointed supreme commander of the CIS Armed Forces in December 1991. Among the numerous treaties signed by the former republics, in order to direct the transition period, was a temporary agreement on general purpose forces, signed in Minsk on 14 February 1992. However, once it became clear that Ukraine (and potentially the other republics) was determined to undermine the concept of joint general purpose forces and form their own armed forces, the new Russian government moved to form its own armed forces.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree forming the Russian Ministry of Defence on 7 May 1992, establishing the Russian Ground Forces along with the other branches of the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, the General Staff was in the process of withdrawing tens of thousands of personnel from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, the Northern Group of Forces in Poland, the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia, the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary, and from Mongolia.

Thirty-seven Soviet Ground Forces divisions had to be withdrawn from the four groups of forces and the Baltic States, and four military districts—totaling 57 divisions—were handed over to Belarus and Ukraine. Some idea of the scale of the withdrawal can be gained from the division list. For the dissolving Soviet Ground Forces, the withdrawal from the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic states was an extremely demanding, expensive, and debilitating process.

As the military districts that remained in Russia after the collapse of the Union consisted mostly of the mobile cadre formations, the Ground Forces were, to a large extent, created by relocating the formerly full-strength formations from Eastern Europe to under-resourced districts. However, the facilities in those districts were inadequate to house the flood of personnel and equipment returning from abroad, and many units &quot;were unloaded from the rail wagons into empty fields.&quot; The need for destruction and transfer of large amounts of weaponry under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe also necessitated great adjustments.

=== Post-Soviet reform plans ===
The Ministry of Defence newspaper &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot; published a reform plan on 21 July 1992. Later one commentator said it was &quot;hastily&quot; put together by the General Staff &quot;to satisfy the public demand for radical changes.&quot; The General Staff, from that point, became a bastion of conservatism, causing a build-up of troubles that later became critical. The reform plan advocated a change from an Army-Division-Regiment structure to a Corps-Brigade arrangement. The new structures were to be more capable in a situation with no front line, and more capable of independent action at all levels.

Cutting out a level of command, omitting two out of three higher echelons between the theatre headquarters and the fighting battalions, would produce economies, increase flexibility, and simplify command-and-control arrangements. The expected changeover to the new structure proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed. The new brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until they happened to be at the proposed brigade strengths. New divisions—such as the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, formed on the basis of disbanding tank formations—were formed, rather than new brigades.

Few of the reforms planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm civilian political guidance, with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed. Secondly, declining funding worsened the progress. Finally, there was no firm consensus within the military about what reforms should be implemented. General Pavel Grachev, the first Russian Minister of Defence (1992–96), broadly advertised reforms, yet wished to preserve the old Soviet-style Army, with large numbers of low-strength formations and continued mass conscription. The General Staff and the armed services tried to preserve Soviet-era doctrines, deployments, weapons, and missions in the absence of solid new guidance.

British military expert Michael Orr claims that the hierarchy had great difficulty in fully understanding the changed situation, due to their education. As graduates of Soviet military academies, they received great operational and staff training, but in political terms they had learned an ideology, rather than a wide understanding of international affairs. Thus, the generals—focused on NATO expansion in Eastern Europe—could not adapt themselves and the Armed Forces to the new opportunities and challenges they faced.

=== Crime and corruption in the ground forces ===
The new Russian Ground Forces inherited an increasing crime problem from their Soviet predecessors. As draft resistance grew in the last years of the Soviet Union, the authorities tried to compensate by enlisting men with criminal records and who spoke little or no Russian. Crime rates soared, with the military procurator in Moscow in September 1990 reporting a 40-percent increase in crime over the previous six months, including a 41-percent rise in serious bodily injuries. Disappearances of weapons rose to rampant levels, especially in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.
Generals directing the withdrawals from Eastern Europe diverted arms, equipment, and foreign monies intended to build housing in Russia for the withdrawn troops. Several years later, the former commander in Germany, General Matvey Burlakov, and the Defence Minister, Pavel Grachev, had their involvement exposed. They were also accused of ordering the murder of reporter Dmitry Kholodov, who had been investigating the scandals. In December 1996, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov ordered the dismissal of the Commander of the Ground Forces, General Vladimir Semyonov, for activities incompatible with his position — reportedly his wife&#x27;s business activities.
A 1995 study by the U.S. Foreign Military Studies Office went as far as to say that the Armed Forces were &quot;an institution increasingly defined by the high levels of military criminality and corruption embedded within it at every level.&quot; The FMSO noted that crime levels had always grown with social turbulence, such as the trauma Russia was passing through. The author identified four major types among the raft of criminality prevalent within the forces—weapons trafficking and the arms trade; business and commercial ventures; military crime beyond Russia&#x27;s borders; and contract murder. Weapons disappearances began during the dissolution of the Union and has continued. Within units &quot;rations are sold while soldiers grow hungry ... [while] fuel, spare parts, and equipment can be bought.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;voyemkomats&quot; take bribes to arrange avoidance of service, or a more comfortable posting.
Beyond the Russian frontier, drugs were smuggled across the Tajik border—supposedly being patrolled by Russian guards—by military aircraft, and a Russian senior officer, General Major Alexander Perelyakin, had been dismissed from his post with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Hercegovina (UNPROFOR), following continued complaints of smuggling, profiteering, and corruption. In terms of contract killings, beyond the Kholodov case, there have been widespread rumours that GRU Spetsnaz personnel have been moonlighting as &quot;mafiya&quot; hitmen.

Reports such as these continued. Some of the more egregious examples have included a constant-readiness motor rifle regiment&#x27;s tanks running out of fuel on the firing ranges, due to the diversion of their fuel supplies to local businesses. Visiting the 20th Army in April 2002, Sergey Ivanov said the volume of theft was &quot;simply impermissible&quot;. Ivanov said that 20,000 servicemen were wounded or injured in 2002 as a result of accidents or criminal activity across the entire armed forces - so the ground forces figure would be less.

Abuse of personnel, sending soldiers to work outside units—a long-standing tradition which could see conscripts doing things ranging from being large scale manpower supply for commercial businesses to being officers&#x27; families&#x27; servants—is now banned by Sergei Ivanov&#x27;s Order 428 of October 2005. What is more, the order is being enforced, with several prosecutions recorded. President Putin also demanded a halt to dishonest use of military property in November 2005: &quot;We must completely eliminate the use of the Armed Forces&#x27; material base for any commercial objectives.&quot;
The spectrum of dishonest activity has included, in the past, exporting aircraft as scrap metal; but the point at which officers are prosecuted has shifted, and investigations over trading in travel warrants and junior officers&#x27; routine thieving of soldiers&#x27; meals are beginning to be reported. However, British military analysts comment that &quot;there should be little doubt that the overall impact of theft and fraud is much greater than that which is actually detected&quot;. Chief Military Prosecutor Sergey Fridinskiy said in March 2007 that there was &quot;no systematic work in the Armed Forces to prevent embezzlement&quot;.
In March 2011, Military Prosecutor General Sergei Fridinsky reported that crimes had been increasing steadily in the Russian ground forces for the past 18 months, with 500 crimes reported in the period of January to March 2011 alone. Twenty servicemen were crippled and two killed in the same period as a result. Crime in the ground forces was up 16% in 2010 as compared to 2009, with crimes against other servicemen constituting one in every four cases reported.

Compounding this problem was also a rise in &quot;extremist&quot; crimes in the ground forces, with &quot;servicemen from different ethnic groups or regions trying to enforce their own rules and order in their units&quot;, according to the Prosecutor General. Fridinsky also lambasted the military investigations department for their alleged lack of efficiency in investigative matters, with only one in six criminal cases being revealed. Military commanders were also accused of concealing crimes committed against servicemen from military officials.
A major corruption scandal also occurred at the elite Lipetsk pilot training center, where the deputy commander, the chief of staff and other officers allegedly extorted 3 million roubles of premium pay from other officers since the beginning of 2010. The Tambov military garrison prosecutor confirmed that charges have been lodged against those involved. The affair came to light after a junior officer wrote about the extortion in his personal blog. Sergey Fridinskiy, the Main Military Prosecutor acknowledged that extortion in the distribution of supplementary pay in army units is common, and that &quot;criminal cases on the facts of extortion are being investigated in practically every district and fleet.&quot;

In August 2012, Prosecutor General Fridinsky again reported a rise in crime, with murders rising more than half, bribery cases doubling, and drug trafficking rising by 25% in the first six months of 2012 as compared to the same period in the previous year. Following the release of these statistics, the Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia denounced the conditions in the Armed Forces as a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;.

In July 2013, the Prosecutor General of Russia&#x27;s office revealed that corruption in the same year had grown 5.5 times as compared to the previous year, costing the Russian government 4.4 billion rubles (US$130 million). It was also revealed that total number of registered crimes in the Russian armed forces had declined in the same period, although one in five crimes registered were corruption-related.

&quot;In 2019, Chief Military Prosecutor Valery Petrov reported that some $110 million had been lost due to corruption in the military departments and the number was on the uptick.&quot;

=== Involvement in Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 ===

The Russian Ground Forces reluctantly became involved in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 after President Yeltsin issued an unconstitutional decree dissolving the Russian Parliament, following its resistance to Yeltsin&#x27;s consolidation of power and his neo-liberal reforms. A group of deputies, including Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, barricaded themselves inside the parliament building. While giving public support to the President, the Armed Forces, led by General Grachev, tried to remain neutral, following the wishes of the officer corps. The military leadership were unsure of both the rightness of Yeltsin&#x27;s cause and the reliability of their forces, and had to be convinced at length by Yeltsin to attack the parliament.

When the attack was finally mounted, forces from five different divisions around Moscow were used, and the personnel involved were mostly officers and senior non-commissioned officers. There were also indications that some formations deployed into Moscow only under protest. However, once the parliament building had been stormed, the parliamentary leaders arrested, and temporary censorship imposed, Yeltsin succeeded in retaining power.

=== Chechen Wars ===

==== First Chechen War ====

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Chechens declared independence in November 1991, under the leadership of a former Air Forces officer, General Dzhokar Dudayev. The continuation of Chechen independence was seen as reducing Moscow&#x27;s authority; Chechnya became perceived as a haven for criminals, and a hard-line group within the Kremlin began advocating war. A Security Council meeting was held 29 November 1994, where Yeltsin ordered the Chechens to disarm, or else Moscow would restore order. Defence Minister Pavel Grachev assured Yeltsin that he would &quot;take Grozny with one airborne assault regiment in two hours.&quot;

The operation began on 11 December 1994 and, by 31 December, Russian forces were entering Grozny, the Chechen capital. The 131st Motor Rifle Brigade was ordered to make a swift push for the centre of the city, but was then virtually destroyed in Chechen ambushes. After finally seizing Grozny amid fierce resistance, Russian troops moved on to other Chechen strongholds. When Chechen militants took hostages in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in Stavropol Kray in June 1995, peace looked possible for a time, but the fighting continued. Following this incident, the separatists were referred to as &quot;insurgents&quot; or &quot;terrorists&quot; within Russia.

Dzhokar Dudayev was assassinated in a Russian airstrike on 21 April 1996, and that summer, a Chechen attack retook Grozny. Alexander Lebed, then Secretary of the Security Council, began talks with the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov in August 1996 and signed an agreement on 22/23 August; by the end of that month, the fighting ended.
The formal ceasefire was signed in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt on 31 August 1996, stipulating that a formal agreement on relations between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the Russian federal government need not be signed until late 2001.

Writing some years later, Dmitri Trenin and Aleksei Malashenko described the Russian military&#x27;s performance in Chechniya as &quot;grossly deficient at all levels, from commander-in-chief to the drafted private.&quot; The Ground Forces&#x27; performance in the First Chechen War has been assessed by a British academic as &quot;appallingly bad&quot;. Writing six years later, Michael Orr said &quot;one of the root causes of the Russian failure in 1994–96 was their inability to raise and deploy a properly trained military force.&quot;

Then Lieutenant Colonel Mark Hertling of the U.S. Army had the chance to visit the Ground Forces in 1994:
The Russian barracks were spartan, with twenty beds lined up in a large room similar to what the U.S. Army had during World War II. The food in their mess halls was terrible. The Russian &quot;training and exercises&quot; we observed were not opportunities to improve capabilities or skills, but rote demonstrations, with little opportunity for maneuver or imagination. The military college classroom where a group of middle- and senior-ranking officers conducted a regimental map exercise was rudimentary, with young soldiers manning radio-telephones relaying orders to imaginary units in some imaginary field location. On the motor pool visit, I was able to crawl into a T-80 tank—it was cramped, dirty, and in poor repair—and even fire a few rounds in a very primitive simulator.

In June 1999 Russian forces, though not the Ground Forces, were involved in a confrontation with NATO. Parts of the 1st Separate Airborne Brigade of the Russian Airborne Forces raced to seize control of Pristina Airport in what became Kosovo, leading to the Incident at Pristina airport.

==== Second Chechen War ====
The Second Chechen War began in August 1999 after Chechen militias invaded neighboring Dagestan, followed quickly in early September by a series of four terrorist bombings across Russia. This prompted Russian military action against the alleged Chechen culprits.

In the first Chechen war, the Russians primarily laid waste to an area with artillery and airstrikes before advancing the land forces. Improvements were made in the Ground Forces between 1996 and 1999; when the Second Chechen War started, instead of hastily assembled &quot;composite regiments&quot; dispatched with little or no training, whose members had never seen service together, formations were brought up to strength with replacements, put through preparatory training, and then dispatched. Combat performance improved accordingly, and large-scale opposition was crippled.

Most of the prominent past Chechen separatist leaders had died or been killed, including former President Aslan Maskhadov and leading warlord and terrorist attack mastermind Shamil Basayev. However, small-scale conflict continued to drag on; as of November 2007, it had spread across other parts of the Russian Caucasus. It was a divisive struggle, with at least one senior military officer dismissed for being unresponsive to government commands: General Colonel Gennady Troshev was dismissed in 2002 for refusing to move from command of the North Caucasus Military District to command of the less important Siberian Military District.

The Second Chechen War was officially declared ended on 16 April 2009.

=== Reforms under Sergeyev ===
When Igor Sergeyev arrived as Minister of Defence in 1997, he initiated what were seen as real reforms under very difficult conditions. The number of military educational establishments, virtually unchanged since 1991, was reduced, and the amalgamation of the Siberian and Trans-Baikal Military Districts was ordered. A larger number of army divisions were given &quot;constant readiness&quot; status, which was supposed to bring them up to 80 percent manning and 100 percent equipment holdings. Sergeyev announced in August 1998 that there would be six divisions and four brigades on 24-hour alert by the end of that year. Three levels of forces were announced; constant readiness, low-level, and strategic reserves.

However, personnel quality—even in these favored units—continued to be a problem. Lack of fuel for training and a shortage of well-trained junior officers hampered combat effectiveness. However, concentrating on the interests of his old service, the Strategic Rocket Forces, Sergeyev directed the disbanding of the Ground Forces headquarters itself in December 1997. The disbandment was a &quot;military nonsense&quot;, in Orr&#x27;s words, &quot;justifiable only in terms of internal politics within the Ministry of Defence&quot;. The Ground Forces&#x27; prestige declined as a result, as the headquarters disbandment implied—at least in theory—that the Ground Forces no longer ranked equally with the Air Force and Navy.

=== Reforms under Putin ===

Under President Vladimir Putin, more funds were committed, the Ground Forces Headquarters was reestablished, and some progress on professionalisation occurred. Plans called for reducing mandatory service to 18 months in 2007, and to one year by 2008, but a mixed Ground Force, of both contract soldiers and conscripts, would remain. (As of 2009, the length of conscript service was 12 months.)

Funding increases began in 1999. After some recovery of the economy and the associated rise in income, especially from oil, &quot;..officially reported defence spending [rose] in nominal terms at least, for the first time since the formation of the Russian Federation&quot;. The budget rose from 141 billion rubles in 2000 to 219 billion rubles in 2001. Much of this funding has been spent on personnel—there have been several pay rises, starting with a 20-percent rise authorised in 2001. The current professionalisation programme, including 26,000 extra sergeants, was expected to cost at least 31 billion roubles (US$1.1 billion). Increased funding has been spread across the whole budget, with personnel spending being matched by greater procurement and research and development funding.

However, in 2004, Alexander Goltz said that, given the insistence of the hierarchy on trying to force contract soldiers into the old conscript pattern, there is little hope of a fundamental strengthening of the Ground Forces. He further elaborated that they are expected to remain, to some extent, a military liability and &quot;Russia&#x27;s most urgent social problem&quot; for some time to come. Goltz summed up by saying: &quot;All of this means that the Russian armed forces are not ready to defend the country and that, at the same time, they are also dangerous for Russia. Top military personnel demonstrate neither the will nor the ability to effect fundamental changes.&quot;

More money is arriving both for personnel and equipment; Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin stated in June 2008 that monetary allowances for servicemen in permanent-readiness units will be raised significantly. In May 2007, it was announced that enlisted pay would rise to 65,000 roubles (US$2,750) per month, and the pay of officers on combat duty in rapid response units would rise to 100,000–150,000 roubles (US$4,230–$6,355) per month. However, while the move to one year conscript service would disrupt &quot;dedovshchina&quot;, it is unlikely that bullying will disappear altogether without significant societal change. Other assessments from the same source point out that the Russian Armed Forces faced major disruption in 2008, as demographic change hindered plans to reduce the term of conscription from two years to one.

=== Serdyukov reforms ===
A major reorganisation of the force began in 2007 by the Minister for Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, with the aim of converting all divisions into brigades, and cutting surplus officers and establishments. In the course of the reorganization, the 4-chain command structure (military district – field army – division – regiment) that was used until then was replaced with a 3-chain structure: strategic command – operational command – brigade. Brigades are supposed to be used as mobile permanent-readiness units capable of fighting independently with the support of highly mobile task forces or together with other brigades under joint command.

In a statement on 4 September 2009, RGF Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Boldyrev said that half of the Russian land forces were reformed by 1 June and that 85 brigades of constant combat preparedness had already been created. Among them are the combined-arms brigade, missile brigades, assault brigades and electronic warfare brigades.

During General Mark Hertling&#x27;s term as Commander, United States Army Europe in 2011–2012, he visited Russia at the invitation of the Commander of the Ground Forces, &quot;Colonel-General (corresponding to an American lieutenant general) Aleksandr Streitsov. ..[A]t preliminary meetings&quot; with the Embassy of the United States, Moscow, the U.S. Defence Attache told Hertling that the Ground Forces &quot;while still substantive in quantity, continued to decline in capability and quality. My subsequent visits to the schools and units [Colonel General] Streitsov chose reinforced these conclusions. The classroom discussions were sophomoric, and the units in training were going through the motions of their scripts with no true training value or combined arms interaction—infantry, armor, artillery, air, and resupply all trained separately.&quot;

=== Reforms under Sergey Shoygu ===

After Sergey Shoygu took over the role of Ministry of Defence, the reforms Serdyukov had implemented were reversed. He also aimed to restore trust with senior officers as well as the Ministry of Defence in the wake of the intense resentment Serduykov&#x27;s reforms had generated. He did this a number of ways but one of the ways was integrating himself by wearing a military uniform.

Shoygu ordered 750 military exercises, such as Vostok 2018. The exercises also seemed to have helped validate the general direction of reform. The effect of this readiness was seen during Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Since Anatoliy Serdyukov had already completed the unpopular reforms (military downsizing and reorganization), it was relatively easy for Shoygu to be conciliatory with the officer corps and Ministry of Defence.

Rearmament has been an important goal of reform, with the goal of 70% modernization by 2020. From 1998 to 2001, the Ground Forces received almost no new equipment. Sergey Shoygu took a less confrontational approach with the defence industry. By showing better flexibility on terms and pricing, the awarding of new contracts for the upcoming period was much better. Shoygu promised that future contracts would be awarded primarily to domestic firms. While easing tensions, these concessions also weakened incentives for companies to improve performance.

Shoygu also focused on forming battalion tactical groups (BTGs) as the permanent readiness component of the Russian army, rather than brigade-sized formations. According to sources quoted by the Russian Interfax agency, this was due to a lack of the manpower needed for permanent-readiness brigades. BTGs made up the preponderance of units deployed by Russia in the war in Donbas. By August 2021 Shoygu claimed that the Russian army had around 170 BTGs.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
Russia conducted a military buildup on the Ukrainian border starting in late 2021. By mid February 2022, elements of the 29th, 35th and 36th Combined Arms Armies (CAAs) were deployed to Belarus, supported by additional S-400 systems, a squadron of Su-25 and a squadron of Su-35; additional S-400 systems and four Su-30 fighters were deployed to the country for joint use with Belarus. Russia also had the 20th and 8th CAAs and the 22nd AC regularly deployed near the Ukrainian border, while elements of 41st CAA were deployed to Yelnya, elements of 1st TA and 6th CAA were deployed to Voronezh and elements of the 49th and the 58th CAA were deployed to Crimea. In all, Russia deployed some 150,000 soldiers around Ukraine during this time, in preparation for the eventual Russian invasion.

On 11 February, the US and western nations communicated that Putin had decided to invade Ukraine, and on 12 February, the US and Russian embassies in Kyiv started to evacuate personnel. On 24 February, Russian troops began invading Ukraine.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian tank losses were reported as a consequence of the Ukrainian use of sophisticated anti-tank weapons and a lack of air support. The Russian army has been described by Phillips O&#x27;Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University as &quot;a boxer who has a great right hook and a glass jaw.&quot; Quoting Napoleon &quot;In war, moral power is to physical as three parts out of four.&quot; Retired US four-star general Curtis Scaparrotti has blamed confusion and poor morale amongst Russian soldiers over their mission as to their poor performance.

Due to the fighting in Ukraine the 2022 Moscow Victory Day Parade was to be reduced by some 35%, purely in ground combat vehicles or systems. The parade on 9 May 2022, according to the official guide, would feature only 25 combat systems and 131 ground combat vehicles, compared to 2021 where it featured 198 vehicles and 35 combat systems. In particular there was a shortage of display ready T-80 tanks and Russia used older equipment to make up numbers. An example is usage of tank transporters in lieu of actual tanks. In 2023 the trend accelerated; only a single World War II-vintage tank was at the parade. As of 6 May, at least 12 generals have been killed in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. This &quot;suggests that the generals need to be at the front lines to ensure that their troops are conducting the battle plan in the way that they want. But that also suggests a lack of confidence in their troops if they need to be that far forward with that many senior folks.&quot; Ukraine further claims that some 317 officers have been killed, a third of whom are senior command staff. In a tweet the UK MoD said that the Russian officer corps was suffering &quot;devastating losses&quot; particularly in the junior to mid officer ranks. United States officials estimated that Russian forces had lost 150,000+ killed and wounded from 24 February 2022 – 21 January 2023. In stark contrast, the Russian Defence Minister said that only 5,937 personnel from the entire Russian Armed Forces had been killed from 24 February – 21 September 2022, the first seven months of fighting. Reported figures from Donetsk and Luhansk would add some 22,000 to this figure.

After 14 months of fighting, Russian forces are estimated to have lost over 2,000 tanks, struggling to replace its tank losses due to sanctions by Europe and the United States. This has caused Russia to compensate by instead of using imported goods, using locally made equipment deemed less efficient, and reactivating tanks from the 1950s and 1960s.

On 14 February 2023, British defence secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that 97% of the Russian ground forces were now committed to the war in Ukraine. Three months afterwards, Russia did not display a single modern tank for the 2023 Moscow Victory Day Parade.

In February 2023, launching the 2023 Military Balance, the IISS estimated Ground Forces numbers had climbed to an estimated 550,000, including an estimated 100,000 conscripts and up to 300,000 mobilized personnel. This number should be set against the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s estimate of 300,000 active duty before February 2022.

In October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to large amount of losses in offensives around Avdiivka with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.

== Structure ==
The President of Russia is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The Main Command (&quot;Glavkomat&quot;) of the Ground Forces, based in Moscow, directs activities. This body was disbanded in 1997, but reformed by President Putin in 2001 by appointing Colonel General Nikolai Kormiltsev as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces and also as a deputy minister of defence.

Kormiltsev handed over command to Colonel General (later General of the Army) Alexey Maslov in 2004, and in a realignment of responsibilities, the Commander-in-Chief lost his position as a deputy minister of defence. Like Kormiltsev, while serving as Commander-in-Chief Maslov was promoted to General of the Army.

In January 2014, the acting commander of the Russian Ground Forces was Lieutenant General Sergei Istrakov, who was appointed by Russian president Vladimir Putin upon the dismissal of former commander Colonel General Vladimir Chirkin over corruption charges in December 2013. Istrakov handed over his position to a new commander on 2 May 2014, Colonel General Oleg Salyukov.

The Main Command of the Ground Forces consists of the Main Staff of the Ground Troops, and departments for Peacekeeping Forces, Armaments of the Ground Troops, Rear Services of the Ground Troops, Cadres of the Ground Troops (personnel), Indoctrination Work, and Military Education. There were also a number of directorates which used to be commanded by the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces, in his capacity as a deputy defence minister. They included NBC Protection Troops of the Armed Forces, Engineer Troops of the Armed Forces, and Troop Air Defence, as well as several others. Their exact command status is now unknown.

=== Branches of service ===

The branches of service include motorized rifles, tanks, artillery and rocket forces, troop air defence, special corps (reconnaissance, signals, radio electronic warfare, engineering, nuclear, biological and chemical protection, logistical support, automobile, and the protection of the rear), special forces, military units, and logistical establishments.

The Motorised Rifle Troops, the most numerous branch of service, constitutes the nucleus of Ground Forces&#x27; battle formations. They are equipped with powerful armament for destruction of ground-based and aerial targets, missile complexes, tanks, artillery and mortars, anti-tank guided missiles, anti-aircraft missile systems and installations, and means of reconnaissance and control. It is estimated that there were 16 motor rifle divisions and 12 motor rifle brigades before the &quot;new look&quot; reforms With the reform, these motor rifle units were converted into 35 motor rifle brigades. With the replacement of Anatoly Serdyukov with Sergei Shoigu as Minister of Defence, some of the disbanded divisions were reformed from already existing brigades, while others, like the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division were reformed from scratch. Some units, like the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, are trained especially for a specific environment. As of 2022, there were 9 motor rifle divisions, 22 motor rifle brigades and one independent motor rifle regiment, the 7th Independent Guards &quot;Proletarian Moscow-Minsk&quot; Motor Rifle Regiment in the Kaliningrad Oblast.

The Navy also has several motor rifle formations under its command in the Ground and Coastal Defence Forces of the Baltic Fleet, the Northeastern Group of Troops and Forces on the Kamchatka Peninsula and other areas of the extreme northeast, apart from traditional naval infantry units. The best-known of these formations is the 126th Coastal Defence Brigade. Also present are a large number of mobilisation divisions and brigades, known as &quot;Bases for Storage of Weapons and Equipment&quot;, that in peacetime only have enough personnel assigned to guard the site and maintain the weapons.

The Tank Troops are the main impact force of the Ground Forces and a powerful mean of armed struggle, intended for the accomplishment of the most important combat tasks. In 2007, there were three tank divisions in the force: the 4th Guards &quot;Kantemirovskaya&quot; and 10th Guards &quot;Uralsko-Lvovskaya&quot; within the Moscow Military District, and the 5th Guards &quot;Don&quot; in the Siberian MD. The 2nd Guards &quot;Tatsinkaya&quot; Tank Division in the Siberian Military District and the 21st Tank Division in the Far Eastern MD were disbanded in the early 2000s, although the first one is still represented in the ground forces though the 5th Separate Guards &quot;Tatsinkaya&quot; Tank Brigade. Like motor rifle divisions, all tank divisions were transformed into brigades following the 2008 reforms, although the 4th Guards Tank Division was reformed in 2013, with two new tank divisions, the 90th Guards and the 47th Guards being created from pre-existing brigades in 2016 and 2022, respectively. The 10th Guards Tank Division is still represented in the ground forces though the 1st Separate Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Brigade. As of 2022, there were 3 tank divisions and 2 tank brigades.

The Artillery and Rocket Forces provide the Ground Forces&#x27; main firepower. The Ground Forces previously included six static defence machine-gun/artillery and field artillery divisions. The only remaining unit of this type is the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division The previous 34th Guards in the Moscow MD, 12th in the Siberian MD, and the 15th in the Far Eastern MD, seem to have disbanded. The 127th Machine Gun Artillery Division was transformed into a motor rifle unit following the Serdyukov reforms. As of 2022, there were 1 machine gun artillery divisions and 17 artillery brigades.

The Air Defence Troops (PVO) are one of the basic weapons for the destruction of enemy air forces. They consist of surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery and radio-technical units and subdivisions.

Army Aviation, while intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces, has been under the control of the Air Forces (VVS) since 2003. However, it was planned that by 2015, Army Aviation will have been transferred back to the Ground Forces and 18 new aviation brigades will have been added. Of the around 1,000 new helicopters that have been ordered under the State Armament Programmes, 900 will be for the Army Aviation. This transfer did not take place.

The Spetsnaz GRU serve under the Ground Forces in peacetime and at the same time are directly subordinated to the Main Directorate of Intelligence (GRU) and will fall under GRU operational control during wartime operations or under special circumstances. The Ground Forces currently fields 7 spetsnaz brigades of varying sizes and one spetsnaz regiment.

=== Dispositions since 2024 ===
As a result of the 2008 Russian military reforms, the ground forces now consist of armies subordinate to the four new military districts: Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Military Districts. The new districts have the role of &#x27;operational strategic commands,&#x27; which command the Ground Forces as well as the Naval Forces and part of the Air and Air Defence Forces within their areas of responsibility.

Each major formation is bolded, and directs the non-bolded major subordinate formations. It is not entirely clear to which superior(s) the four operational-strategic commands will report from 1 December 2010, as they command formations from multiple services (Air Force, Ground Forces &amp; Navy). A current detailed list of the subordinate units of the four military districts can be found in the respective articles. During 2009, all 23 remaining divisions were reorganised into four tank brigades, 35 motor-rifle brigades, one &quot;prikritiya&quot; brigade formed from a machinegun-light artillery division, and three airborne-assault brigades (pre-existing). Almost all are now designated &quot;otdelnaya&quot; (separate), with only several brigades retaining the guards honorific title.

In 2013, two of these brigades were reactivated as full divisions: the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division and 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division. These two divisions marked the beginning of the expansion of the Ground Forces as more brigades are being reformed into full divisions within each military district.

Since 1 January 2021, the Northern Fleet has been elevated into the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command. However, 
in December 2022 it was announced that the Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts were to be reformed. It is thus likely that the Northern Fleet will be relieved of land forces command responsibilities.

== Personnel ==


In 2006, the Ground Forces included an estimated total of 360,000 persons, including approximately 190,000 conscripts. The IISS counted both the Ground Forces and the Russian Airborne Forces together, which produced a figure of 395,000. This can be compared to an estimated 670,000, with 210,000 conscripts, in 1995–96. These numbers should be treated with caution, however, due to the difficulty for those outside Russia to make accurate assessments, and confusion even within the General Staff on the numbers of conscripts within the force.

The Ground Forces began their existence in 1992, inheriting the Soviet military manpower system practically unchanged, though it was in a state of rapid decay. The Soviet Ground Forces were traditionally manned through terms of conscription, which had been reduced in 1967 from three to two years and in 2008 to a full year, following which those who have served their mandatory service may sign contracts to become professional servicemen. This system was administered through the thousands of military commissariats (&quot;voyenkomat&quot;s) located throughout the Soviet Union. Between January and May of each year, every young Soviet male citizen was required to report to the local &quot;voyenkomat&quot; for assessment for military service, following a summons based on lists from every school and employer in the area.

The &quot;voyenkomat&quot; worked to quotas sent out by a department of the General Staff, listing how many young men were required by each service and branch of the Armed Forces. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, draft evasion has skyrocketed - officials regularly bemoan the ten or so percent that actually appear when summoned. The new conscripts were then picked up by an officer from their future unit and usually sent by train across the country.

On arrival, they would begin the Young Soldiers&#x27; course, and become part of the system of senior rule, known as &quot;dedovshchina&quot;, literally &quot;rule by the grandfathers.&quot; There were only a very small number of professional non-commissioned officers (NCOs), as most NCOs were conscripts sent on short courses to prepare them for section commanders&#x27; and platoon sergeants&#x27; positions. These conscript NCOs were supplemented by &quot;praporshchik&quot; warrant officers, positions created in the 1960s to support the increased variety of skills required for modern weapons.

The Soviet Army&#x27;s officer-to-soldier ratio was extremely top-heavy, partially in order to compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following World War II and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to accept responsibility for the soldiers&#x27; welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above).

Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.

In the early 2000s, many junior officers did not wish to serve—in 2002, more than half the officers who left the forces did so early. Their morale was low, among other reasons because their postings were entirely in the hands of their immediate superiors and the personnel department.&quot;

There is little available information on the current status of women, who are not conscripted, in the Russian Ground Forces. According to the BBC, there were 90,000 women in the Russian Army in 2002, though estimates on numbers of women across the entire Russian Armed Forces in 2000 ranged from 115,000 to 160,000. Women serve in support roles, most commonly in the fields of nursing, communications, and engineering. Some officers&#x27; wives have become contract service personnel. By 2013, there were 29,000 women serving in the Armed Forces, none above the rank of colonel. 3.5% served in command posts.
A 2016 TASS article stated: &#x27;At the end of the 2000s, over 90,000 women were serving in the Russian Armed Forces&#x27;, but that number fell to &#x27;about 45,000&#x27; in 2011. TASS explained this drop as follows: &#x27;After the military authorities increased their requirements for female applicants and in connection with the overall reduction in the number of service personnel in the RF Armed Forces, this number has decreased significantly.&#x27;

It appears that Defence Minister Shoigu said that 1,100 women were deployed in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March 2023.

From small beginnings in the early 1990s, employment of contract soldiers (&quot;kontraktniki&quot;) has grown greatly within the Ground Forces, though many have been of poor quality (wives of officers with no other prospective employment, for example). In December 2005, Sergei Ivanov, then Minister of Defence, proposed that—in addition to the numerous enlisted contract soldiers—all sergeants should become professional, which would raise the number of professional soldiers and non-commissioned officers in the Armed Forces overall to approximately 140,000 in 2008. The current programme allows for an extra 26,000 posts for fully professional sergeants.
The CIA reported in the &quot;World Factbook&quot; that 30 percent of Russian army personnel were contract servicemen at the end of 2005, and that, as of May 2006, 178,000 contract servicemen were serving in the Ground Forces and the Navy. Planning calls for volunteer servicemen to compose 70 percent of armed forces by 2010, with the remaining servicemen consisting of conscripts. At the end of 2005, the Ground Forces had 40 all-volunteer constant readiness units, with another 20 constant readiness units to be formed in 2006. These CIA figures can be set against IISS data, which reports that at the end of 2004, the number of contracts being signed in the Moscow Military District was only 17 percent of the target figure; in the North Caucasus, 45 percent; and in the Volga-Ural, 25 percent.
Whatever the number of contract soldiers, commentators such as Alexander Goltz are pessimistic that many more combat ready units will result, as senior officers &quot;see no difference between professional NCOs, ... versus conscripts who have been drilled in training schools for less than six months. Such sergeants will have neither the knowledge nor the experience that can help them win authority [in] the barracks.&quot; Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov underlined the in-barracks discipline situation, even after years of attempted professionalisation, when releasing the official injury figures for 2002. 531 men had died on duty as a result of accidents and crimes, and 20,000 had been wounded (the numbers apparently not including suicides). According to Ivanov, &quot;the accident rate is not falling&quot;. Two of every seven conscripts will become addicted to drugs and alcohol while serving their terms, and a further one in twenty will suffer homosexual rape, according to 2005 reports.
Part of the reason is the feeling between contract servicemen, conscripts, and officers. 

In mid-March 2023, plans to replenish the Ground Forces&#x27; numbers of &quot;kontrakniki&quot; (contract service personnel) by 400,000 were made public.

== Equipment ==
The Russian Ground Forces retain a very large quantity of vehicles and equipment. There is also likely to be a great deal of older equipment in state military storage, a practice continued from the Soviet Union. However, following the collapse of the USSR, the newly independent republics became host to most of the formations with modern equipment, whereas Russia was left with lower-category units, usually with older equipment. As financial stringency began to bite harder, the amount of new equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only ten tanks and about 30 BMP infantry fighting vehicles were being purchased each year.

New equipment, like the Armata Universal Combat Platform, Bumerang, and Kurganets-25, has been introduced since 2015, and has begun replacing old tanks and armored vehicles such as the BMPs, BTRs like the T-72, T-90, BMP-1/2/3, and BTR-80s that have been in active service. Funding for new equipment has greatly risen in recent years.

Two Iskander-M missile system brigade sets, over 60 Tornado-G MLRS and more than 20 Msta-SM self-propelled howitzers have been received in 2016. The Russian Ground Forces received two brigade sets of Buk-M3 and Buk-M2 air defence missile complexes in 2016. Troops also received two division sets of Tor-M2 and two of Tor-M2U air defence missile complexes. Moreover, the Forces received Verba MANPADS, more than 130 BMP-3 IFVs and BTR-82A APCs as well as more than 20 Tigr-M armored vehicles equipped with the Arbalet-DM combat module.

Russian troops have reportedly received 2,930 new or modernized systems allowing for two missile brigades, two SAM brigades and two SAM regiments, one &quot;Spetsnaz&quot; brigade, 12 motorized rifle and tank battalions, and three artillery divisions to be reequipped.

Over eight years, more than 2,500 units of armored weapons have been delivered to tank formations and military units of the Ground Forces, including more than 1,000 upgraded tanks T-72B3, T-72B3M, T-80BVM and T-90M. The motorized rifle troops received more than 1,500 units of infantry fighting vehicles BMP-3, upgraded BMP-2 and armored personnel carriers BTR-82A (AM).

The missile forces and artillery of the Ground Forces from 2012 to 2020 received over 1,500 units of military equipment - operational-tactical missile systems &quot;Iskander-M&quot;, multiple launch rocket systems of the &quot;Tornado&quot; family, self-propelled howitzers &quot;Msta-SM&quot;.

In 2022, there was a shortage of munitions. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in an article on 13 September 2023, citing US and European officials, that Russia was managing to overcome the international sanctions and its missile production exceeded pre-war levels. It was also reported that Russia now produces more ammunition than the United States and Europe and it can manufacture 200 tanks and two million units of ammunition in a year. CNN also reported in September 2023 that the Estonian Defense Ministry claimed that Russia produced ammunition seven times cheaper and eight times faster than Europe.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian Ground Forces received in 2023 several hundreds of thousands of small arms, new and repaired weapon systems, military vehicles and equipment, artillery systems, air defense systems, and also over a million individual armor protection and equipment means. CNN reported on 11 March 2024 that Russia currently produces about 250,000 artillery shells a month or about 3 million a year which is nearly three times the quantity the US and Europe produce for Ukraine. A NATO official said that Russia imports ammunition from Iran and North Korea.

=== Equipment summary ===

The IISS writes that its &quot;in store&quot; numbers indicate equipment &quot;..held away from front-line units; readiness and training varies.&quot; Russia has 10 Central Tank Reserve Bases, at least 37 mixed equipment- and armaments-storage bases, and at least 12 artillery-storage bases.

In July–August 2022, a relatively credible assessment of Russian main battle tanks in store indicated that there might only be some 6,000 vehicles in store, of which 3,000 might be able to be reactivated. Another more exact analysis the same month estimated that &quot;2,048 tanks are relatively combat-ready (886 of them are being preserved under dry air), 1,304 tanks are in storage, and 2,299 tanks are for disposal. A total of 5,651 tanks (of which 2,299 were to be disposed of) and 1,330 tank spaces in hangars.&quot; In February 2023, launching the 2023 edition of the &quot;Military Balance,&quot; the IISS amended their long-term storage estimate of old tanks to 5,000.

While more modern vehicles such as T-72s, T-80s, T-90s have been stored, these vehicles cannot be properly activated from store, due to a lack of preventive and corrective maintenance. Thus, instead, T-62s have been activated for use.

On 24 July 2024, the Ukrainian Commander-in-chief Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that after two and a half years of invasion the Russian Army has &quot;doubled&quot; the number of its tanks - from 1,700 to 3,500 - and tripled the quantity of its artillery systems while the number of its armored personnel carriers has grown from 4,500 to 8,900.

== Ranks and insignia ==

The newly re-emergent Russia retained most of the ranks of the Soviet Army, with some minor changes. The principal difference from the usual Western style is some variation in generals&#x27; rank titles—in at least one case, Colonel General, derived from German usage. Most of the modern rank names used in the Russian military were borrowed from existing German/Prussian, French, English, Dutch, and Polish ranks upon the formation of the modern Russian Army in the late 17th century, and have lasted with few changes of title through the Soviet period.

== Ground Forces Day ==

On 31 May 2006, President Vladimir Putin signed decree No. 549 &quot;On the establishment of professional holidays and memorable days in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation&quot;, according to which it was ordered to celebrate Ground Forces Day (). The date chosen for the holiday commemorates the edict made by Tsar Ivan the Terrible on 1 October 1550 on the placement in Moscow and surrounding districts of a thousand servicemen forming a local brigade of Streltsy, which essentially became a key document in the further formation and development of the Imperial Russian Army.

Ground Forces Day was first celebrated on the Preobrazhenskaya Square in Moscow in the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord, where a bishop&#x27;s service was held. Before the start of the service, an order of the Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu and the decree of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow were read, according to which the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Lord officially became the main temple of the RF Ground Forces. A year later, the holiday was celebrated with the adoption of the Ground Forces Anthem.

The following holidays are also celebrated by the Ground Forces: Day of Tankmen, Day of Rocket Forces and Artillery, Day of Air Defence.

<text>Kornhill and Kornhill Gardens are apartment buildings on the northern slope of Mount Parker, in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. Kornhill is a private housing estate and Kornhill Gardens is a Private Sector Participation Scheme estate. The total population is approximately 30,000.
==History==
The name comes from a small hill within the area close to the foot of Mount Parker. Kornhill was the site of the company residence of the senior manager of the Taikoo Sugar Refinery and the first senior manager was Ferdinand Korn. The hill was almost levelled by the early 1980s, and can hardly be recognised. The modern-day housing estate was constructed in concert with the MTR Island line and opened by 1987.

==Modern development==
There are a total 44 blocks, with heights ranging from 20 to 34 storeys, including 42 conventional residential buildings, one block of serviced apartments, and an office tower. The residential blocks in Kornhill are named after English letters and there are two blocks of each letter (i.e. A1, A2, D1, D2, P1, P2.) In Kornhill Gardens, the blocks are named in Arabic numbers from 1 to 10. Kornhill Gardens blocks are sold under the HOS Scheme.

Blocks A1 to H2 are on Hong Shing Street (). Blocks J1 to M2 are on Hong Yue Street (). Blocks N1 to R2 are on Hong On Street (). There is no block I, O, and S to Z. Blocks 1 to 10 are on southern side (western bound) of King&#x27;s Road.

<doc id="1094756" wikidata="Q1085906" url="?curid=1094756" title="Ventotene">
<text>Ventotene (; locally ; or ; , or ) is one of the Pontine Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the coast of Gaeta right at the border between Lazio and Campania, Italy. The municipality of Ventotene, of the province of Latina (Lazio) had 708 permanent residents .

==Geography==
The island, the remains of an ancient volcano, is elongated, with a length of and a maximum width of about .

The municipality includes the small ancillary island of Santo Stefano, located to the east, which was the site of a massive prison, now closed. Further islands are Ponza, Palmarola and Zannone, located to the west.

=== Climate ===
Ventotene has a typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters that tend to be very windy. &quot;Vento&quot;, as in the island&#x27;s name, meaning wind in Italian, is apt to describe the prominent weather condition for this small island far out at sea. The temperature never drops below .

== History ==
===Roman Empire===

Ventotene, like all the Pontine Islands, was owned by the Emperor Augustus (r. 31 BC - 14 AD) who had a huge summer palace built on the island in the early part of his reign, including extensive &quot;thermae&quot;, terraces, gardens, an exedra and aqueducts, and which remained thereafter an imperial property. It is now known as the Villa Giulia as it was possibly the place to which he banished his daughter Julia the Elder in 2 BC as a reaction to her notorious adultery and where he could easily keep an eye on her. Augustus had two villas on the island but Julia was probably sent to the Villa Giulia located on the Punta d&#x27;Eolo on the north of the island, with all the facilities of an imperial retreat.

In 29 AD, emperor Tiberius banished Augustus&#x27; granddaughter Agrippina the Elder, who perished, probably of malnutrition, on 18 October 33 AD. After Agrippina the Elder&#x27;s son Gaius, (better known as Caligula), became emperor in 37 AD, he went to Pandataria to collect her remains and reverently brought them back to Rome. Agrippina the Elder&#x27;s youngest daughter, Julia Livilla, was exiled to Pandateria twice: the first time by her brother Caligula for plotting to depose him, and the second time by her uncle, the emperor Claudius, at the instigation of his wife, Messalina, in 41 AD.

Sometime later, Julia Livilla was discreetly starved to death and her remains were probably brought back to Rome when her older sister Agrippina the Younger became influential as Claudius&#x27; wife. Another distinguished lady of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Claudia Octavia, who was the first wife of the emperor Nero, was banished to Pandateria in 62 AD and then executed on the orders of her husband.

This is also the island to which St. Flavia Domitilla, the granddaughter of the emperor Vespasian, was banished.

===Twentieth Century===
A prison camp was created under the Bourbons and restructured under Benito Mussolini on the nearby island of Santo Stefano. There, up to 700 opponents, including 400 communists, were incarcerated between 1939 and 1943. One of them was Altiero Spinelli who wrote there a text now known as the &quot;Ventotene Manifesto&quot;, promoting the idea of a federal Europe after the war.

During World War II, the island served as home to a 114-man German garrison, which defended a key radar station. On the night of 8 December 1943, an American PT boat slipped into Ventotene&#x27;s harbour undetected and offloaded 46 American paratroopers from the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, led by naval lieutenant (and actor) Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who was tactical commander of the Beach Jumpers; a group that used all forms available of deception to deceive the enemy, and commando-trained. The paratroopers met with a local exile from the Italian mainland who then lied to the German commander that there was a regiment of paratroopers on the island, deposited by a fleet of Allied ships. Terrified, the German commander demolished his positions, weapons, and quickly surrendered to the weaker American force before realizing his mistake. Ventotene was liberated at 03:00 without a shot being fired. The story is reported by John Steinbeck in &quot;Once There Was A War&quot;.

In August 2016, then-Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met with then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then-French President François Hollande on Ventotene, to lay a wreath at the tomb of Altiero Spinelli and review European Union policy in the light of the then-impending British withdrawal from the EU.

== Environment ==

=== Nature Reserve ===
Ventotene and Santo Stefano are both part of a nature reserve created in 1999 in order to preserve the ecological, geomorphological and naturalistic-environmental characteristics and to promote activities compatible with the conservation of the reserve&#x27;s natural resources. This means that new buildings cannot be erected, and reconstruction is limited.

=== Marine Reserve ===
The marine reserve, which covers a 10 km long coastal area, is divided into three zones with varying degrees of protection and permitted activities.

Ventotene is a popular destination for scuba divers due to its clear, warm waters and variety of marine life. Several diving centres take divers of all levels of competency to nearby destinations to see caves filled with prawns, or swim among fish which have become rather unafraid of people since fishing was banned in 1997. There are also guided tours to see Roman amphorae from ships sunk 2000 years ago and the large steamer Santa Lucia, which was sunk during World War II, resulting in nearly 100 dead. It lies at a depth of about. There is also a lot to be seen with the use of snorkeling gear at only a few meters depth around the island and its beaches.

=== Bird migration ===

Ventotene is a well-known birdwatching location as the island serves as an essential stopover point for large numbers of migratory birds. The bird observatory, which was founded in 1988, rings approximately 20,000 birds a year. During the height of the spring migration in April and May, thousands of birds arrive daily from North Africa&#x27;s coasts after having flown 400 – 500 km non-stop. The Pontian Archipelago offers the first chance to stop after the prolonged flight and, due to the tiny size of Ventotene, the concentration of birds of numerous species is extremely high. The exhausted birds rest and feed frenetically quite indifferent to human presence, allowing birdwatchers to observe and photograph them as in few other places in Italy.

The bird observatory is part of PPI (Progetto Piccole Isole), a project which has studied the bird migration across the Mediterranean since 1988 at 46 sites in seven countries. The results of these studies led to the creation of the Ventotene Bird Migration Museum in 2006.

== Main sights ==

=== The Ruins of Villa Giulia ===

In the early part of his reign, emperor Augustus had a summer palace built on the island, which at the time was private property. The remnants of the huge complex of over , which included thermae, terraces, gardens, an exedra and aqueducts, can be seen at Punto Eolo. Over the centuries, the villa has been subject to systematic plundering and senseless excavations. However, excavations have revealed thermal baths, servants’ quarters, courtyards, water reservoirs and passages to the sea. The imperial summer residence has become known as Villa Giulia as it became the place of exile of Augustus&#x27;s daughter Julia the Elder in 2 BC.
=== The Roman Port ===

The Roman port, which is still in use, was built to support emperor Augustus’ summer residence, as there was no natural harbour on the island. It was entirely excavated in the rock banks and about were removed to create a port with a narrow, protected inlet. It is approximately long by at its widest and deep. The quayside was lined by storerooms and depots hewn from the rock, nowadays converted to bars, restaurants, shops and diving centres.

=== The Fishery ===
At the foot of the lighthouse are the remnants of the Roman fishery excavated in the rock, consisting of three pools, one outside and two in rooms with arched roofs where fragments of decorated plaster and stuccoes remain. A sophisticated system of canals and shutters, devised for water exchange and the transfer of fish from one compartment to another, ensured a constant supply of many kinds of fresh fish to the imperial household, all year round and in all weather conditions.

The fishery is best viewed from the water, swimming with snorkeling gear, as the sea level today is about a metre (1 yard) higher than when it was constructed.
=== The cistern of the &quot;Carcerati&quot; ===

As Ventotene has never had an adequate supply of fresh water, several enormous cisterns to collect rainwater were built in Roman times in the central parts of the island. They were excavated in the rock to a depth of approximately 10 m and consist of a system of vaulted roof tunnels, galleries, basins and corridors. One of these, known as the &quot;Carcerati&quot; (prisoners), can be visited on guided tours. The name derives from the convicts who were sent to the island in the late 18th century to build the present village and were housed in the by then empty reservoir. The walls of the galleries are covered with graffiti, inscriptions and drawings from various centuries, but particularly from the convicts who drew images of houses and nature to remember places they were never to see again.

=== Santo Stefano Prison ===

The prison on the island of Santo Stefano was completed in 1797 with a design based on the theories of Jeremy Bentham, the English philosopher, jurist and social reformer, and his concept of the ideal prison he named &quot;Panopticon.&quot; This involved the architecture of institutional buildings to allow all prison cells to be observed by a single unseen security guard, who may or may not be present, giving them the sensation of being constantly watched. The prison is an attractive large three-story building with 99 cells in the shape of a horseshoe and a watchtower at the centre of the courtyard.

Many famous political prisoners have spent time here, such as Carmine Crocco, the most important brigand during the Italian unification, and Gaetano Bresci, the anarchist who killed King Umberto I in 1900 and was imprisoned there for a year before being hanged in his cell by his jailers. During the Fascist regime, many antifascists were locked up at Santo Stefano, including the future President of Italy, Sandro Pertini. The prison was closed in 1965.
=== The Archaeological Museum ===
The Archaeological Museum of Ventotene is located on the ground floor of the Bourbon castle, seat of the Town Council. It contains finds from the island, the seabed and the wreckages of Roman ships around the island, as well as a large model of the island during the Augustan age with the Imperial residence and connected structures, such as the port and other villas. Unfortunately, all statues from Villa Giulia have disappeared or been sold in indiscriminate plundering over the centuries, and all that remains is a marble head bust of emperor Tiberius, on display in the museum.

In July 2009, archaeologists announced the discovery of a &quot;graveyard&quot; of five ancient Roman ships in the deep waters off Ventotene, with their pristine cargoes of olive oil, garum and metal ingots. One ship carried a full load of a kind of dish called a mortarium, in which foods were ground or mashed. Some of the recovered objects were immediately placed on view at Ventotene.
=== The Bird Observatory and Migration Museum ===
Italy&#x27;s only bird migration museum can be found at the high, southern end of the island in a building called &quot;Il Semaforo&quot;. The information at the museum is based on 20 years of the observatory&#x27;s research and monitoring, and explains how, where and why birds migrate as they do and the importance of bird ringing. There are real-sized models of many of the species which use Ventotene as a stopover. During the spring and autumn migration, visitors can go along and watch while birds are weighed, measured and ringed.

== Culture ==
=== Santa Candida Festival ===
The celebration of the island&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Candida, takes place on 20 September, but the festivities start ten days beforehand with the daily launch of a hot air balloon accompanied by a marching band. The decorated paper balloons, a type of giant sky lantern up to 10 m in height, are constructed by the island&#x27;s youth during the summer and on the 19th there is a balloon competition as part of “The Games” that take place in the Roman port all afternoon. The festival culminates in a day-long feast and religious procession on the 20th, when a statue of Saint Candida, placed on a flower adorned boat, exits the church, and is carried around the island&#x27;s narrow streets on the shoulders of eight men. As with all events during the festival, the band plays and firecrackers and fireworks are set off continuously. The celebrations end with two fireworks displays.

== Transport ==
The island is connected by a daily ferry and hydrofoil service to Formia provided by the ferry company Laziomar. This is supplemented by summer services to Anzio and Terracina on the mainland, and the nearby island Ponza. During the summer months, SNAV also operates routes between Ventotene and Naples, as well as the island of Ischia.

<doc id="1094759" wikidata="Q3408442" url="?curid=1094759" title="Home Ownership Scheme">
<text>The Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) is a subsidised-sale public housing programme managed by the Hong Kong Housing Authority. It was instituted in the late 1970s as part of the government policy for public housing with two aims – to encourage better-off tenants of rental flats to vacate those flats for re-allocation to families in greater housing need; and also to provide an opportunity for home ownership to families unable to afford to buy in the private sector.

Under the scheme, the government sells flats to eligible public housing tenants and to lower-income residents at prices below the market level, with discounts usually between 30 and 40 per cent. It restricts resale of the units in the second-hand market to other families who qualify or, on the open market, after payment of a premium equal to the updated value of the discount given on the original purchase. As an ancillary scheme, the Housing Authority also entered into arrangements with local private developers to provide property for sale under the [[Private Sector]] Participation Scheme (PSPS).

Between 1995 and 2000, the Hong Kong Housing Society also offered the Sandwich Class Housing Scheme for lower middle class families whose incomes exceeded the Home Ownership Scheme requirements, but still had trouble affording private housing. In 2002, falling real estate values led the government to pause the construction of new Home Ownership Scheme estates.

The Hong Kong government announced the resumption of the HOS programme in 2011 in response to public discontent over the territory&#x27;s high housing prices. A new series of HOS estates were inaugurated in 2017, and more are under construction.

==History==

In 1953, a fire broke out in the Shek Kip Mei squatter area. Over 53,000 people were homeless after the fire. The government started to build resettlement blocks to house the victims. The government announced a Ten- year Housing Program and established the Hong Kong Housing Authority to manage the public housing. From 1978 to 2003, the government ran the Home Ownership Scheme for PRH residents and low&amp;middle income families. 
The first such plan was launched in 1978 and the first batch of flats became available in 1980, the first estates being Yuet Lai Court in Kwai Chung, Shun Chi Court in Kwun Tong, Shan Tsui Court in Chai Wan, Chun Man Court in Ho Man Tin, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Yue Fai Court in Aberdeen.

In 1987, forecasting that the demand for home-ownership was on the rise, the Government launched a plan to redevelop the older housing estates, and introduced a greater choice of apartments available for purchase by public housing tenants. A Home Purchase Loan Scheme was introduced with, initially, a quota of 2,000 loans of HK$50,000 interest-free to make the downpayment on their new private-sector homes.

In December 1991, there was a huge rush to buy 6,452 Housing Authority properties in 17 projects. Flats were to be sold at a discount of 40 per cent, the most attractive for several years.

On 3 September 2001, Dr. Michael Suen Ming Yeung, the Chief Secretary, announced that the Home Ownership Scheme would be stopped. The Housing Authority stopped sale of HOS and PSPS flats for ten months until end of June 2002. Donald Tsang, the Chief Secretary for Administration announced that the sales of HOS flats would not exceed 9,000 a year up to 2005–06, subject to the continuing need to avoid competition with the private sector residential market. Thereafter, they expected more radical cuts in the HOS programme. The Housing Authority started to offer surplus HOS flats for sale in batches until 2011.
In 2011, the government announced the Home Ownership Scheme again because of the aspiration for home ownership. Over 460,000 subsidised housing flats have been sold until now.

==Short piling==
In 2000, the scheme was caught up in a short-piling scandal which resulted in the resignation of Housing Authority chief Rosanna Wong, and a censure for housing director Tony Miller. The construction of 2 blocks of Yu Chui Court in Sha Tin was delayed as it had to be demolished and rebuilt at an estimated cost of HK$250 million. The Wai Kee Group was implicated, and some of its companies were delisted from Government projects following the publication of the Strickland Report.

==Resale==
Public housing units in Home Ownership Scheme housing estates are subject to sale restrictions under the Housing Ordinance. The Home Ownership Scheme Secondary Market is only open to eligible low-income residents and low-income tenants of rental public housing. Three years after being assigned HOS public housing units, owners are allowed to obtain a certificate from the Housing Authority to place their homes in the HOS Secondary Market, without paying the subsidised land premiums (normally 35–50 per cent discount to the prevailing market). Owners who have sold their HOS public housing units will no longer be eligible for any form of public housing. In general, they are allowed after five years to apply to place their homes in the HOS Secondary Market without paying subsidised land premium, or to apply for removal of sale restrictions by first paying the full subsidies and the land premiums to the Housing Authority, as decided by the Director of Housing.

In 2002, developers complained of weakness in property prices, claiming the housing marketplace was largely distorted by excessive unfair competition from schemes such as the HOS. It was pointed out that a public rental tenant moving into a second-hand HOS flat would receive three lots of subsidies. Government halted the PSPS, developments which were in progress at the time were either transformed into public housing, or sold off to private developers. Construction of new HOS estates was suspended in November 2002, and it was also announced that the TPS would end.
==Hung Hom Peninsula controversy==
One PSPS project, the 2,470 flat Hung Hom Peninsula built by New World Development and Sun Hung Kai Properties, was sold for a below-market land premium of HK$864 million to New World Development, who subsequently sold off half share to Sun Hung Kai Properties. In 2004, the consortium announced the demolition of these buildings to make way for luxury apartments, which was met by public outcry over the needless destruction of &quot;perfectly good buildings&quot; to satisfy &quot;corporate greed&quot;. In an unprecedented about-turn, the developers withdrew the plan on 10 December 2004. The buildings were substantially renovated instead.

<doc id="1094767" wikidata="Q2494239" url="?curid=1094767" title="Oregon Route 212">
<text>Oregon Route 212 is an Oregon state highway that serves the eastern Portland metro area. It is an east–west route, running between Boring and Clackamas.

==Route description==
OR 212 begins at Interstate 205 and OR 213 in Clackamas and heads east as a four lane highway. This section of OR 212 is part of the Clackamas Highway No. 171. The route then intersects with OR 224 and remains concurrent with it for about . The highway then condenses down to two lanes and continues east heading toward Damascus. This section of OR 212 is the Clackamas-Boring Highway No. 174 (see Oregon highways and routes). Along the way, there are numerous intersections with backroads that lead to Gresham, Portland&#x27;s biggest eastern suburb. The sides of this route are covered in farms and berry fields. It then enters the town of Boring, remaining as a two lane road and reaches its eastern terminus at an interchange with US 26, northwest of Sandy.

==History==
A previous alignment through Boring ran due west onto Fireman Way, curving south onto 272nd.

Two junctions with 257th Ave give away an old alignment. OR 212 traveled due west on the eastern junction with 257th, curving south to meet the western junction.

Armstrong Circle at 172nd is a previous alignment.

Before the construction of I-205, OR 212 continued west on a shared alignment with OR 213 to Oregon City. There, it crossed the Willamette River into West Linn and continued west to Tualatin where it eventually terminated at an intersection with OR 99W. This section replaced the original Oregon Route 244, but was eventually decommissioned after I-205 was completed; however the entire route can still be driven (other than a now-closed bridge across the Clackamas River which used to connect Oregon City with Gladstone, Oregon).

Before US 26 was rerouted, it used to run on Orient Drive. OR 212 traveled this brief segment of Compton Road before the US 26 realignment shortened it.

<text>The occurred in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, at 17:56 local time (08:56 UTC) on Saturday, October 23, 2004. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) named it the . Niigata Prefecture is located in the Hokuriku region of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. The initial earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6 and caused noticeable shaking across almost half of Honshu, including parts of the Tōhoku, Hokuriku, Chūbu, and Kantō regions.

== Details ==
The first quake struck the Chuetsu area of Niigata Prefecture, Japan on the Muikamachi Fault zone, with a reading of 7 on the Japanese &quot;shindo&quot; intensity scale at Kawaguchi, Niigata. The moment magnitude of the earthquake is estimated at 6.6. For comparison, the Great Hanshin earthquake, which devastated much of Kobe, measured 7 on the &quot;shindo&quot; scale, with a magnitude of 7.3. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 15.8 km. The JMA gave the coordinates of the earthquake as .

A second earthquake occurred at 18:11, 16 minutes after the first. This one, at a much shallower depth, had a &quot;shindo&quot; intensity of 6+ and a magnitude of 5.9. A third, at 18:34, had a &quot;shindo&quot; intensity of 6−. At 19:45, another intensity 6− earthquake occurred. Intervening and subsequent earthquakes of lesser intensity also shook the region. During the first 116 hours, 15 earthquakes with intensities of &quot;shindo&quot; 5− or higher rocked the Chuetsu region.

In a press release, the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI) of the Government of Japan published preliminary estimates that a fault having a length of 22 km and a width of 17 km moved approximately 1.4 m.

This was the deadliest earthquake to strike Japan since the January 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, until the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.

This was also first time a snake robot was used at a natural disaster site. A Souryu serpentine robot was used in a house in Nagaoka City that was damaged during this earthquake.

== Seismic intensity ==
== List of major aftershocks ==
The following is a list of major earthquakes that have occurred in Niigata Prefecture since October 23, 2004:
== Damage ==
As late as November 3, the 39th fatality attributable to the earthquakes occurred as perceptible aftershocks continued. 68 dead and 4,795 injuries were reported in Niigata Prefecture. Over one hundred thousand people fled their homes. The earthquakes caused houses to collapse in Ojiya and damaged thousands in the area. 

For the first time in its 40-year history, a Shinkansen train derailed while in service, the train being too close to the epicentre to be halted by the automatic UrEDAS earthquake detection system. Eight out of ten cars of the &quot;Toki&quot; 325 service (a 200 Series Shinkansen train) derailed on the Joetsu Shinkansen line between Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka and Urasa Station in Yamato; no injuries were reported among the 155 passengers. The railbed, bridges and tunnels were all affected. East Japan Railway Company (JR East) stopped all trains in Niigata Prefecture, including the extensively damaged Joetsu Line, Shinetsu Main Line, Iiyama Line, Tadami Line and Echigo Line. Part of Nagaoka Station appeared ready to collapse as a result of an aftershock, but after a brief closure, the station reopened. 

The section of the Joetsu Shinkansen between Echigo-Yuzawa Station and Tsubame-Sanjo Station closed. Buses transferred passengers between the two operating sections of the line: Tokyo Station to Echigo-Yuzawa Station and Tsubame-Sanjo Station to Niigata Station.

On December 27, 2004, service resumed on all remaining parts of the Joetsu and Iiyama Lines reopened. On December 28, 2004, the Joetsu Shinkansen also reopened, the last to do so.

Japan Highways closed all expressways in Niigata Prefecture. Closures affected the Kanetsu Expressway and the Hokuriku Expressway. As of November 4, the Kanetsu Expressway remained closed between Nagaoka Interchange and Koide Interchange. This segment reopened on November 5.

Landslides and other problems forced closure of two national highways, National Route 8 and National Route 17, as well as several prefectural roads. This isolated several localities, including nearly the entire village of Yamakoshi, which was then a village in the district of Koshi but since merged with and became part of the city of Nagaoka. On July 22, 2005, the government lifted the nine-month-old evacuation order for 528 of the 690 affected households.

The earthquakes also caused a landslide that partially buried three vehicles. A young boy was rescued from one of these vehicles, but his mother and sister perished. (Recent typhoons had waterlogged the soil, making landslides more likely.)

The quake broke water mains. Extensive electric power, telephone (including cellular telephone) and Internet outages were reported. The cellular telephone system suffered from direct damage to relay stations, as well as depletion of battery back-up power supplies in as little as a day.

==Aftermath==
On April 1, 2007, the directive to evacuate five settlements in the former village of Yamakoshi (later part of the city of Nagaoka) was lifted. Residents were permitted to return to their homes after a span of nearly two and a half years.

The movie A Tale of Mari and Three Puppies was based on events that took place during this earthquake.

==History==
Niigata Prefecture has been hit by numerous earthquakes in recorded history. Notable recent ones include a large quake on June 16, 1964 that had a magnitude of 7.5, killing 28, where major liquefaction had occurred and tsunami destroyed the port of Niigata city.

There was also the 2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake, both striking shortly after major typhoons passed by, causing complications.

<doc id="1094784" wikidata="Q2449813" url="?curid=1094784" title="Transvaal Park">
<text>Transvaal Park was a water park in Yasenevo, a southern district of Moscow, Russia. It had an African theme and was named after a former province of South Africa. With heated pools, including a wave pool and twisting &quot;river&quot; for tubing, it became one of the most popular attractions in the Moscow area and a symbol of the country&#x27;s bloom of private enterprise. After being open for two years, the roof collapsed, killing 28 people. The park was subsequently closed.

==History==
===Construction===
Transvaal Park was developed by the architectural company Sergey Kiselev and Partners, under architect Nodar Kancheli. The sports and entertainment complex was a five-story building shaped like a whale&#x27;s tail, covering a total area of 20,200 m², of which about 7,000 m² was dedicated to water attractions. The project&#x27;s client was the company European Technologies and Service, which secured a loan of $17.3 million from Sberbank. The total cost of construction was estimated at $40 million.

Initially, there were plans to engage European builders, but due to difficulties in obtaining the necessary licenses and the absence of required Russian standards at that time, the Turkish company Koçak İnşaat Ltd. agreed to build the water park and partially finance the construction.

Construction began in 2000, and by June 2002, Transvaal Park was operational. At the time of its construction, the water park was the largest in Europe and included water attractions, a sports pool, two sauna sections, a bowling alley with a café bar and billiards, a restaurant, a gym, and a beauty salon. The complex could accommodate about 2,000 people.

===Collapse===
On 14 February 2004, at 7:15 p.m., the dome of the complex collapsed. Estimates suggest that up to 1,300 people were inside the water park at the time. The date, a Valentine&#x27;s Day Saturday, attracted a large number of young visitors.

The collapsed area was approximately 5,000 m². The dome fell onto the water entertainment area, sparing only the adult pool. It resulted in 28 deaths (including 8 children), 12 severe injuries, and 189 other injuries. Kancheli was blamed for the collapse. Two years later, on 23 February 2006, at 09:30 am, the roof of the Basmanny market, also designed by Kancheli, collapsed, killing 66 people.

Kancheli claimed that terrorists likely attacked the venue, but the cause was found to be faulty design.

===Investigation and trials===
An investigation was launched, lasting about twenty months, and resulting in the criminal prosecution of Kancheli and the head of the Moscow State Non-Departmental Expertise, Anatoly Voronin. In 2006, both men were released. Kancheli was granted amnesty at his request to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State Duma. On 30 August 2006, criminal proceedings against Voronin were dropped for lack of criminal intent. Attempts by the victims&#x27; representatives to appeal the decisions were unsuccessful.

===Aftermath===
In 2005, on the anniversary of the tragedy, a memorial stone with the names of the deceased was placed at the walls of Transvaal Park.

On 13 February 2008, victims and relatives of the deceased filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights, demanding recognition of violations by the Russian Federation and the awarding of fair compensation to the victims.

In 2013, the multipurpose complex Moreon was opened on the site of the former water park, and a chapel commemorating the tragedy was established on its premises.

<doc id="1094787" wikidata="Q713543" url="?curid=1094787" title="Cat City">
<text>Cat City (; ) is a 1986 Hungarian adult animated comic science fiction film, directed by Béla Ternovszky and written by József Nepp. The title &quot;Cat City&quot; was used in the United States distribution. The film was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.

The film is a parody of several famous feature films, mainly the James Bond series. It tells the story of a special agent who is sent to the city of &quot;Pokyo&quot; to obtain the secret plans of a machine that could save mouse society. Of course, the cats not wanting this to happen, send four rat gangsters to stop this special agent, but they never end up proving as efficient as they initially seem. The film has developed a cult following in the years since its release. A musical based on the film premiered in December 2011.

==Plot==
In year 80 AM (Anno Mickey Mouse), the mice of Planet X are threatened by humiliation and total apocalypse. The well-organized, fully equipped gangs of evil cats are aiming for the total obliteration of mice, not caring for the old conventions between mice and cats. But in the last moment, when the mouse leaders are beginning to consider leaving the planet, a new hope rises...

==Reception==
Gabriella Székely of Filmvilág gave a mixed review, calling it a &quot;stereotype Gangster film which ends with a happy ending&quot;

== Home media ==
In 2023, Deaf Crocodile Films announced a Blu-ray release of the film, the first time ever in the United States. The release is based on a restoration by National Film Institute Hungary.

==In other media==
A comic book adaptation, illustrated by József Nepp, Béla Ternovszky, and Zoltán Maros was released in 1987.

A musical based on the film, adapted by Róbert Szikora and Attila Valla, premiered in December 2011.

==Sequel: &quot;Cat City 2: The Cat of Satan&quot; ==
Production of the sequel &quot;Cat City 2: The Cat of Satan&quot; () started in September 2005. It was made on a budget of about 600 million HUF. The story of Cat City 2 centers around an investigative journalist named Stanley Mouse, who wants to find out about the legend of an ancient &quot;cat tribe&quot; lost in Africa. He finds them and much more, once again threatening the continued existence of mouse civilization. Special Agent Grabowsky will act to save the day, however. The events are supposed to take place some 20 years after the first episode, as one of the already leaked cells shows the titular Cat-Catcher mecha rusting away in a shelter, and a grown-up child of some character appears in the plot.

Premiering on December 20, 2007, by January 2008 it had made the Hungarian Box Office Top Ten for 6 consecutive weeks. It was the &quot;most watched Hungarian film&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="1094788" wikidata="Q1708999" url="?curid=1094788" title="Pigmy Love Circus">
<text>Pigmy Love Circus is a Los Angeles rock band that has existed since the mid-1980s era of the Hollywood underground rock scene.

Pigmy Love Circus originally consisted of Shepherd Stevenson on bass, Mike Savage on vocals, Anthony Martinez (of Black Flag) on drums, with Rand &quot;Pig&quot; Walters and Peter Fletcher on guitars. Danny Carey, who already played in a number of other bands such as Green Jellÿ and Tool, played with them briefly in 1992, but left to focus on Tool.

By 1995, Pigmy Love Circus disbanded. What was left of the band went their separate ways. Savage went on to form 57 Crown and Big Ugly, both being formidable bands in Hollywood. Stevenson now acts and composes music for film. Fletcher moved to Denver, Colorado. Rand &quot;Pig&quot; Walters lives in South Carolina.

In 1999, Fletcher returned to Los Angeles and the flame was rekindled when Carey demanded a reunion.

The band toured several times in the U.S. in 2002–2004 both alone and also opening for A Perfect Circle in the U.S. and Canada.

In 2012, Pigmy Love Circus played a Dog Patch Wino Reunion show at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles. As of May 2020 this was their final appearance.

In 2014, Rand &quot;Pig&quot; Walters reappeared and released a solo record which is only currently available on his rawpork2014.com website.
It was recorded in Nashville and San Francisco, engineered, mixed and mastered by Mark Fuller. Walters died April 19, 2024

On April 19, 2024 Rand &quot;Pig&quot; Walters died due to complications from pneumonia. 

Known for lively, confrontational concerts the band&#x27;s music and primal energy incite fans to jump on stage (encouraged by the band) and sing along on songs such as &quot;Dagwood Killed Blondie&quot; and &quot;Mad House Clown&quot;. The band achieved iconic status in the Los Angeles underground music scene.

<doc id="1094790" wikidata="Q3309238" url="?curid=1094790" title="Last call">
<text>In a bar, a last call (last orders) is an made shortly before the bar closes for the night, informing patrons of their last chance to buy alcoholic beverages. There are various means to make the signal, like ringing a bell, flashing the lights, or announcing verbally.

Last call times are often legally mandated and vary widely globally as well as locally. Legislation&#x27;s purposes include reducing late night noise in the neighborhood, traffic crashes, violence, and alcohol related health problems.

== Australia ==
In New South Wales, there is no specified closing time, but in residential areas, bars are often required to close at midnight. In non-residential areas, some bars are open 24 hours. A six-hour daily closure period applies to new licenses (and extended hours authorizations) granted from 30 October 2008, which is nominated depending on individual and community circumstances.

During a significant part of the early 20th century, bars in Australia and New Zealand were closed at 6p.m. by law. The resulting rush to buy drinks after work was known as the six o&#x27;clock swill.

== Austria ==
Bar closing hours in Austria are regulated by the federated states. In most states bars must close at 4a.m. although many places have special permits to close later. In the capital, Vienna, bars and clubs are allowed to stay open until 6a.m. Alcohol is allowed to be served until the bar or club closes.

== Belgium ==
There is no legally mandated last call in Belgium; many bars will stay open all night.

== Brazil ==
There is no legally mandated last call in Brazil; many bars will stay open all night. Some cities have laws that require bars to close during the early morning hours.

== Canada ==
* British Columbia: Last call for serving alcohol is generally 2:00 a.m. provincially. Municipalities may change last call to as early as 12a.m. or as late as 4a.m. if they so choose. Downtown Vancouver&#x27;s last call was moved to 4:00 a.m. but was subsequently lowered to 3a.m. On New Year&#x27;s Eve last call is extended to 4a.m. provincewide if food is available to patrons at the premises. Regulated liquor stores (both private and government-operated) can sell off-premises alcohol from 9:00 a.m. until 11:00p.m., with government-operated liquor stores typically closing before 9p.m.
* Alberta: Last call and sale of alcohol from a store or establishment is 2a.m. province-wide. In an establishment, a customer may have no more than two drinks in possession after 1a.m. or last call, whatever comes first. All liquor drinks are to be removed from patron areas by 3:00a.m. at the latest.
* Manitoba: Last call and the sale of alcohol from a store or establishment is 2a.m. province-wide. During special events, establishments are permitted to serve alcohol until 3a.m.
* Ontario: Last call begins at 1:45a.m. and fifteen minutes are allowed for ordering an alcoholic beverage. It is no longer legally permissible to serve alcohol past 2a.m., although the province has the authority to grant waivers to allow closing at 4a.m. during special events. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, all licensed premises are allowed to serve until 3:00 a.m. In all cases, there is always an added 45 minute &quot;consumption period&quot; allowing patrons additional time to consume their purchases after alcohol sales have ended. Even though licensed establishments are never required to close their doors by a certain time, all alcohol must be removed by the end of the consumption period. Alcohol sales may occur only within regulated stores, which will always close between 9p.m. and 11p.m., depending on the location or the store (LCBO, Beer Store, Wine Stores or selected grocery stores).
* Quebec: Last call is 3a.m. province wide for establishments &quot;serving&quot; alcohol (with some exceptions), while the sale of alcohol from a store is restricted after 11p.m. Bars may allow customers to stay until 4a.m. but may not serve alcohol past 3a.m. Bars across the river from Ottawa (Hull area) close at 2a.m. to match their Ontario counterparts.
* New Brunswick: Sales can start at 11:00 a.m. but must end at 2:00 a.m. the following day. A tolerance period of 30 minutes, beyond 2:00 a.m., is allowed to give patrons time to consume their beverage. At 2:30 a.m. the premises must be vacated.
* Newfoundland and Labrador: Last call is 2a.m. on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and 3a.m. the rest of the week. There is then a 30 minute &quot;consumption period&quot; before bars must close.
* Nova Scotia: Last call for most establishments is 2a.m., Cabaret businesses are allowed to serve until 3:30 a.m.
* Saskatchewan: Last call is 2a.m. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, it is extended until 2:30 a.m. (on Jan. 1).
* Northwest Territories; Yukon: Last call is 2a.m., extended to 3a.m. on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

== China ==
Many bars, KTVs and nightclubs have no specific last call and will continue to sell alcohol and stay open provided there are paying customers present. During times when national security is increased (i.e. the Olympics, the 60th Anniversary of the PRC), closing times may be in effect in some cities between 1 and 2a.m. Alcohol is sold through retailers 24 hours a day.

== Croatia ==
Establishments that serve drinks may register as bars and may be open in inhabited areas only indoors and only between 9p.m. and 6a.m., but no such restrictions exist if bars are located outside inhabited areas. Various exceptions can be made for bars located in transit facilities, if approved by the local authorities, etc. The prescribed working hours for bars are a frequent point of contention between city authorities and local businessmen, particularly during the summer tourist season.

== Finland ==
Bars are allowed to serve drinks until 1:30 a.m., but a provincial government may at the proprietor&#x27;s request, grant extensions up to 4a.m. Extensions require the establishment to maintain a higher standard of amenities, service and entertainment by, for example, providing a coat check, entertainment programming such as a DJ or live music, and even general cleanliness and &quot;look and feel&quot; count. The laws were loosened beginning of 2018.

A last call is not announced per se, but as a custom, the lights are flashed a few times (or in case of a dimly lit establishment such as a nightclub, all lights are left on) to notify the customers that serving drinks is over. In Finnish lexicon &quot;valomerkki&quot; (lit. &quot;Light signal&quot;) has become a common synonym for ending any activities for the night.

== Germany ==
Bar closing hours in Germany are regulated by the federated states or cities. Since the 2000s, many federated states and cities have none or relaxed regulations. In many states and cities bars are open as long as there are customers.

Open-air locations such as beer gardens often must close at 11p.m. or 12a.m. to reduce noise pollution. Exceptions may exist for weekends, Carnival and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Not all cities strictly enforce the regulation.

== Greece ==
In Greece, all bars, cafeterias, clubs and the like will stay open as long as there are customers inside. Usually, cafeterias stay open until 11p.m., bars until 2a.m. and clubs until early in the morning, but there is no last call. In 1994, Stelios Papathemelis, the Minister for Public Order, passed a law mandating closing of all bars at 2a.m. The law was widely unpopular, never materialized fully and was abolished a few years later.

== India ==
India closing time of bars vary in different states. In Delhi it is 1am, Mumbai 1:30am, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata at midnight. In Chandigarh it is 1a.m. weekdays and 2a.m. weekends. In Bangalore it is 11:30 p.m. on weekdays and 1am on Friday and Saturday nights.

== Ireland ==
Bar closing hours are governed by the &quot;Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000&quot;. Generally, bars must close at 23:30 Monday to Thursday, 00:30 on Friday and Saturday, and Sunday closing time is 23.00. There are special provisions for certain holidays and festivals. Bars may get an extended license until 02:30 any night.

On 25 October 2022, the Government announced a reform of licensing laws in the &quot;Sale of Alcohol Bill 2022&quot;. If passed, the law would permit bars to open until 00:30 every day. &quot;Late bars&quot; would continue to be permitted to open until 02:30, and nightclubs would be permitted to open until 06:00 (with the sale of alcohol ending at 05:00).

== Israel ==
In Israel, there are no specific closing times and the country has liberal alcohol laws. Bars and clubs in entertainment districts will serve alcohol practically 24 hours a day, while in residential districts local regulations apply; establishments that serve alcohol outside may often have to call their guests inside after midnight or even close completely.

In 2006, Knesset member Ruhama Avraham attempted to pass a bill in parliament that would forbid selling alcohol between 2 and 6a.m. The bill faced severe resistance from bar and restaurant owners and finally was drawn back.

In Tel Aviv, bars are fined for remaining open past 1a.m. Though few bars actually close at that time, they are forced to pay the &quot;back-door&quot; tax to the municipality, with no recourse to the national government. A number of bars are contemplated closing at the required time and during internationally promoted events such as Gay Pride Week in protest of the city&#x27;s underhanded hypocrisy in promoting itself as &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot; but also fining the very establishments that make it such a hot tourist spot.

Alcohol is no longer sold around the clock in grocery stores, and no sales are allowed between 11p.m. and 6a.m.

== Italy ==
Italy does not have a legally mandated closing time. Alcohol may be served or sold anywhere 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
In Rome, an ordinance was passed in January 2009 to make 2a.m. the last call in Campo de&#x27; Fiori and the neighbourhoods of Trastevere and Testaccio. The new last call time for these areas was initiated to curtail nighttime commotion in those popular parts of Rome.

== Japan ==
Japan does not have a legally mandated closing time. Alcohol may be served or sold anywhere 24 hours a day.

== New Zealand ==
Until December 18, 2013, bars could close at any time they wanted (often 7am). Since December 18, 2013, all bars and nightclubs must close at 3 or 4am. Special conditions apply on Holy/ Maundy Thursday, Holy Saturday (Easter Eve), the day before ANZAC day and Christmas Eve, when bars must close their doors by midnight. Private bars and workingmen&#x27;s clubs may stay open beyond that curfew.

==Norway==
Last call laws vary by municipality.
;Municipality-specific laws:
*Oslo Municipality: 3a.m.
*Bergen: 2:30 a.m. (3a.m. at places that plays live music)
*Trondheim: 2a.m.
*Stavanger: 3a.m., only for venues that are 21+
*Moss: 2:30a.m.
*Fredrikstad: 1:30a.m.
**Bodø: 3a.m.
*Harstad: 3a.m.
*Hamar: 1:30a.m.
*Kristiansand: 2a.m.
*Molde: 2a.m.
*Ålesund: 3a.m.
*Drammen: 3a.m.
*Tønsberg: 3a.m.
*Tromsø: 3a.m.
*Kirkenes: 2a.m.
*Arendal: 2a.m.
*Kongsberg: 2a.m.
*Larvik: 2a.m.
*Longyearbyen: 2a.m.

Out of the 357 municipalities of Norway, almost 50% have established a closing time or &quot;last call&quot; at 2a.m. Only 1 in 7 municipalities serves drinks until the maximum allowance at 3a.m. That is a major decrease over the last few years because of the government&#x27;s belief that reduced drinking hours equal less fighting, noise, disturbance, etc.

== Sweden ==
In Sweden, explicit last calls do not take place, as it would violate a political principle not to encourage people to drink more. The latest allowed closing time of bars and restaurant is decided by the municipality but regulated by national laws and rules. The standard latest time is 1a.m. But in many cities a later time can be allowed on some conditions, like high security and staff educated in responsible serving of alcohol. In some of the largest cities, a closing time as late as 5a.m. occurs. During the coronavirus pandemic 2020-2021 the alcohol law was used to limit the number of visitors to bars and restaurants (only for those serving alcohol) by setting the closing time to 8p.m.

== Turkey ==
Turkey does not have a legally mandated closing time. In the new Turkish system, alcohol may no longer be sold in grocery stores past 11pm, but may still be sold in bars and clubs with no legally mandated last call.

== United Kingdom ==

 Standard closing time was 11pm, but increased flexibility was allowed in November 2005 under the Licensing Act 2003.

The average &quot;Last Call&quot; time is between 11pm and 1am in municipalities such as Birmingham and London. This information was taken from two hundred bars from 2014 to 2016.

<text>Quarry Bay is an area beneath Mount Parker in the Eastern District of Hong Kong Island, in Hong Kong. Quarry Bay is bordered by Sai Wan Ho to the east, Mount Parker to the south, North Point to the west, and Victoria Harbour to the north.

Quarry Bay is a residential and business district in Hong Kong. One Island East, the seventh tallest building in Hong Kong, is located in Quarry Bay. Some government departments such as the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council have relocated their offices from Central and Wan Chai to Quarry Bay over the years, and some multinational companies have their offices located in the district, such as Ernst &amp; Young, BNP Paribas, LVMH and Boston Consulting Group, etc. Cityplaza and Kornhill Plaza, being one of the largest shopping malls on Hong Kong Island is at Quarry Bay.

With dense population as well as developed economic and commercial activities in the district, Quarry Bay has a considerable traffic demand. It is one of the transportation hubs in Hong Kong. There are two MTR stations in the district, being Quarry Bay Station and Taikoo Station. Quarry Bay Station is the intersection of the Island line and Tseung Kwan O line. Other transportation means in the district include buses, minibuses, and trams.

==History==
The 1819 edition of the &quot;Gazetteer of Sun On County&quot; () did not mention today&#x27;s Quarry Bay. Historians such as Anthony Kwok Kin Siu suggested Quarry Bay was a remote area before British colonial time.

During colonial Hong Kong times, the Hakka stonemasons settled in the area after the British arrival.

This area was a bay where rock from the hillsides were quarried and transported by ship for building construction or road building. The Chinese name &quot;Tsak Yue Chung&quot; () reveals that it was a small stream where crucian carp () could be found in the 19th century. The English name was &quot;Arrow Fish Creek&quot;. The original bay has disappeared since land reclamation has taken place, and was about from the current coastline.

===Taikoo===
The eastern part of Quarry Bay, namely &quot;&quot;, was largely owned by Swire and therefore many places and facilities are named after the company&#x27;s Chinese name, Taikoo. The river originally flowed into the bay, however it was shut off from the sea with the construction of the to supply fresh water to the Taikoo Dockyard, the Taikoo Sugar factory at Tong Chong Street (), and later the Swire Coca-Cola factory at Greig Road () and Yau Man Street (). The upper course of the river was converted into a cement-paved catchwater, and the lower course is the present-day Quarry Bay Street (), with the original estuary near the Quarry Bay Street – King&#x27;s Road junction.

In the mid-1980s, the hillside was converted into Kornhill apartment buildings, the reservoir into () apartment buildings, and the Dockyard into Taikoo Shing. The Coca-Cola factory is now apartment Kornville (), and Taikoo Sugar is now the Taikoo Place, a commercial hub.

===Lai Chi===
The western end of Quarry Bay was historically part of North Point; during the 1930s its beaches became one of the most popular places for holding swimming galas in Hong Kong. From this basis an upmarket entertainment complex, the Ritz Nightclub (), was built in the area in 1947. The nightclub was demolished a few years later to make way for the construction of apartment buildings during the latter half of the 1950s. Nonetheless, for years afterwards, the western part of Quarry Bay continued to be known informally as &quot;Lai Chi&quot; (), made more so by the name being homophone to Cantonese for &quot;late as usual&quot; () – a reference to King&#x27;s Road, until 1984 the only thoroughfare in the area and thus infamous for traffic congestion.

To this day, some buildings in the western part of Quarry Bay are named as &quot;North Point something building&quot;, although they are across the modern-day limit of North Point at Man Hong Street / Healthy Street West.

<text>The Arafura Games was a multi-sport event where athletes with a disability compete in the same program as able-bodied athletes. Competitors from around the world compete in the week-long games held every 2 years in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.

Called a &quot;meeting of Sporting Neighbours&quot;, the Arafura Games takes its name from the Arafura Sea, which lies between northern Australia and Southeast Asia. Nations along the Arafura Sea originally formed the basis of the Arafura Games, however in recent years countries from further afield have participated, including United States, England, Brazil and Liechtenstein.

==History==
First held in 1991. A foundation sport of the Arafura Games, Basketball has grown from a 4 team competition with teams from around the Darwin region to an 8 team international competition with teams from all over the world. The Games were known as the Arafura Sports Festival up until 1997. These Games were the first ever international sporting festival to have Australian Rules Football as an international competition sport in its own right. The International Australian Football Council was formed after the 1995 Games, playing an important role in promoting Aussie Rules until dissolving in 2001.

The Arafura Games were cancelled in 2003 due to concern over the SARS virus. From 2005 onwards, the Arafura Games included events for athletes with physical disabilities. The 2007 Arafura Games received patronage from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

In 2011, the Arafura Games incorporated the Oceania Paralympic Championships for the sports of athletics,
swimming, powerlifting, and table tennis.

The 2013 Arafura Games was cancelled by the newly elected CLP government on 31 October 2012 as it &quot;costs too much to run&quot;.

After an eight-year hiatus, the 2019 Arafura Games were held from 27 April to 4 May 2019.

The 2021 games were postponed until 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however it was later announced by the then Major Events Minister Natasha Fyles, that all future Arafura Games were to be scrapped.

==Basketball==
Conducted under Federation of International Basketball Associations (FIBA) conditions and Guidelines, Basketball is played at the Darwin Basketball Stadium, Abala Road Marrara, in the Marrara Sporting Complex.

In recent years, USA squad players from university teams dominated the competition. The Northern Territory team have been shaded in the last 4 Arafura Games by the Americans and only their depth on the bench has let them down. The Northern Territory have won the Silver medal in the past 4 Arafura games. 2007 Arafura Games Basketball results:

:Gold &quot;United States of America: USA Colleges&quot;
:Silver &quot;Northern Territory: Northern Territory&quot;
:Bronze &quot;Australian Indigenous: Australian Indigenous&quot;

<text>Ronn Owens (born Ronald Lowenstein on October 17, 1945, in New York City), was the host of &quot;The Ronn Owens Report&quot;, a ten-minute weekday radio program airing on KGO in San Francisco.

==Career==
Owens began his career in broadcasting in 1968 after graduating from Temple University. He hosted radio programs in Atlanta, Miami, Cleveland, and Philadelphia before moving to KGO Radio of San Francisco in 1975. In 2004, the Disney/ABC-owned station signed Owens to an eight-year guaranteed contract to continue hosting &quot;The Ronn Owens Program.&quot; At its peak, the program had more than 500,000 regular listeners.

Owens was off the KGO airwaves during an 88-day contract dispute that ended in February 1995. Reportedly, the dispute involved a difference of opinion over whether to allow national syndication of his show.

Between 1997 and 1998, Owens&#x27; show was simulcast in Los Angeles on KABC, also owned by Disney. Owens took the time slot held by Michael Jackson, whose ratings were declining. Despite signing a five-year contract to do the simulcast, after one year Owens vacated the time slot at KABC, because his show had failed to generate adequate ratings in Los Angeles. Owens reportedly blamed both Jackson and KABC — Jackson for &quot;taking shots&quot; at Owens &quot;on the air and off the air&quot; and KABC for failing to promote Owens&#x27; show. Disney reportedly bought out the remainder of Owens&#x27; simulcast contract.

Ronn Owens left his broadcast two hours early on Monday, September 17, 2007, after spending his first hour sounding very lethargic. He returned to the air on September 24, 2007, explaining that he had been diagnosed with transient global amnesia (TGA), a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person&#x27;s memory. In Owens&#x27; case it was triggered by the adverse interaction of two prescription drugs.

On December 2, 2011, KGO fired all of its on-air show hosts except for Owens. He remained in the 9 a.m.-to-noon slot, with the other hours being all-news or Bloomberg Radio. On March 31, 2016, Owens announced that as of April 4, 2016 he would be moving to the 3 p.m.-to-6 p.m. slot on KGO&#x27;s sister station, KSFO. On April 4, 2016, Owens announced that he would remain at KGO, but in a modified time slot of 10 a.m. to Noon. Owens has a personal services contract with the station that does not allow for early termination. Owens was paid more than $1 million per year, the highest salary for a broadcaster in northern California. On January 1, 2013, Owens signed a two-year guaranteed contract extension.

Owens was elected into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame in 2007 as a member of the second class to be inducted. In November 2015, he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago (cite Chicago Tribune), which the Atlanta Constitution called &quot;the greatest honor a radio professional can achieve.&quot; He has also won two Marconi Awards as &quot;Large Market Personality of the Year&quot; in 2003 and 2010.
(CITE National Association of Broadcasters).

After 42 years hosting his talk show on KGO Radio, on January 16, 2018, he began hosting a ten-minute feature, &quot;The Ronn Owens Report&quot;, which aired at 12:50 PM and 3:50PM weekdays. It featured interviews and observations from the &quot;Voice of the Bay Area.&quot; (cite San Francisco Chronicle) The report contained interviews and observations from Ronn on political and pop culture issues.

==Highlights and accomplishments==

In 2002, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; named Owens one of its 25 Greatest Radio Talk Show Hosts of All Time. He was ranked 13th, making him the top local personality in the country.

In 2003 and again in 2010, Owens won the Marconi Award for Major Market Personality of the Year by the National Association of Broadcasters.
In 2006, he was named 2006 Talk Show Personality of the Year by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;.

In 2007, he was inducted into the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame.

In 2015 he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

==Personal==
Owens is married to former KGO and KCBS Radio news anchor/talk host Jan Black. They have two daughters.

In August, 2014, Owens revealed that he had had Parkinson&#x27;s disease for more than 12 years. He indicated that his Parkinson&#x27;s disease has progressed slowly and he had not wanted to make his condition public knowledge until that time. In part, the recent death of comedian Robin Williams, who also had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, became the deciding factor in Owens&#x27; decision to go public on his condition.

==Bibliography==
His first book, &quot;Voice of Reason: Why the Left and Right Are Wrong&quot;, was published in 2004 by John Wiley and Sons.

<doc id="1094802" wikidata="Q150352" url="?curid=1094802" title="Foreign language">
<text>A foreign language is a language that is not an official language of, nor typically spoken in, a specific country. Native speakers from that country usually need to acquire it through conscious learning, such as through language lessons at school, self-teaching, or attending language courses. A foreign language might be learned as a second language; however, there is a distinction between the two terms. A second language refers to a language that plays a significant role in the region where the speaker lives, whether for communication, education, business, or governance. Consequently, a second language is not necessarily a foreign language.

Children who learn more than one language from birth or at a very young age are considered bilingual or multilingual. These children can be said to have two, three, or more mother tongues, meaning these languages would not be considered foreign to them, even if one language is a foreign language for the majority of people in the child&#x27;s birth country. For instance, a child learning English from their English parent and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language for them. This situation is common in countries like India, South Africa, or Canada, which have multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have an advantage in learning foreign languages compared to adults. However, studies have shown that pre-existing knowledge of language and grammar rules, as well as a superior ability to memorize vocabulary, may benefit adults when learning foreign languages.

==Foreign-language education and ability==

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation. By 1998, nearly all pupils in Europe studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being Ireland, where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both Irish and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign-language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of primary school or the start of secondary school. In Luxembourg, Norway and Malta, however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in Flanders at age 10. In Wales, all children are taught Welsh from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal GCSE qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial immersion to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the European Commission&#x27;s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The Lisbon Summit of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.

Despite the high rate of foreign-language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a British survey by recruitment firm Office Angels showed that fewer than one in 10 UK workers could speak a foreign language and that less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2012, a European Commission survey found that 61% of respondents in the UK were unlikely to speak any language other than their mother tongue (page 5).

Since the 1990s, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from &quot;The Atlantic&quot; claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the US population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.

===Instruments for foreign-language learning===
In recent years, computer-assisted language learning has been integrated into foreign-language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed. Language learning aids such as foreign-language writing aid and foreign-language reading aid, targeted at the specific language skills of foreign-language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign-language learners.

==Research into foreign-language learning==
Learning a foreign language provides various benefits, ranging from improving career opportunities to enhancing cognitive abilities.

In 2004, the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the United Kingdom conducted a study that found that speaking a second language could increase an average worker&#x27;s salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime, and are also more likely to be more successful with the opposite sex. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a bilingual or multilingual person can earn much more than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. In addition, due to the increase in the number of people from different parts of the world, a multilingual person can more easily communicate with prospective customers.

Also in 2004, a study by University College London (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language. The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser grey matter than those who learned one later. Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specialized cells called neurons. The researchers concluded that learning a second language changes the structure of the brain and enhances its functionality.

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies, which helps not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math. Children who are exposed to a second language early on have different ways of expressing themselves, which helps them better understand that there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

Another benefit of learning a foreign language is that it improves one&#x27;s attention span and ability to multitask. A study by the University of the Potomac found that bilinguals have better control over their attention and can switch between tasks more easily than monolinguals. This is because bilinguals have to constantly monitor which language they are using and suppress the interference from the other language. This mental exercise trains their executive function, which is responsible for planning, organizing, problem-solving and decision-making. Learning a foreign language also boosts one&#x27;s creativity, as it exposes them to new ways of expressing ideas and thinking outside the box.

Learning a foreign language also has positive effects on one&#x27;s first language. According to the Cambridge Assessment English blog, learning another language helps students improve their literacy skills in their native language, as they become more aware of grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure. Learning a foreign language also enhances one&#x27;s understanding of other cultures and perspectives, as they can access more information and entertainment sources in different languages and communicate with people from diverse backgrounds. This can foster empathy, tolerance and respect for others.

In summary, learning a foreign language is not only useful for practical purposes, but also beneficial for cognitive, social and personal development. It can improve one&#x27;s brain power, memory, concentration, creativity, communication skills and cultural awareness. It can also open up new opportunities for education, work and travel. Therefore, learning a foreign language is a worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to enrich their lives and broaden their horizons.

==Foreign language versus second language==
Although significant differences between the definitions of second language and foreign language may be hard to find as the two terms are often taken as synonyms, research has been carried out to shed light on the differentiating traits of the two. The distinction between acronyms TESL (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and TEFL (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows the attention different researchers have paid to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide the following information about second language:

&quot;In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one&#x27;s native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in Catalonia (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like Nigeria, India, Singapore and the Philippines (plus Spanish), because English fulfills many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home).&quot;

They also define a &quot;foreign language&quot; as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language. For example, French is a foreign language for most people in England. However, French is not a foreign language for most people in France.

Crystal (2003) notes that &quot;first language&quot; is distinguishable from &quot;second language&quot; (a language other than one&#x27;s mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from &quot;foreign language&quot; (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the US).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term &quot;second language&quot; has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term &quot;foreign language&quot; is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between &#x27;second&#x27; and &#x27;foreign&#x27; has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.

Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O&#x27;Grady &quot;et al.&quot; (1384) do not mention the exact terms &#x27;second&#x27; and &#x27;foreign&#x27; language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between &#x27;second language&#x27; and &#x27;foreign language&#x27; is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention &#x27;second-language situation&#x27; and &#x27;foreign-language situation&#x27; as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second-language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign-language learning).

A &#x27;second language&#x27; usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to United States, then English becomes a second language for them. Thus, British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language, and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. Meanwhile, people in Kurdistan can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second-language learning are often different from foreign-language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign-language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second-language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. They can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so much naturalistic practice is possible.

Second-language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

Acculturation that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second-language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign-language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second-language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between &#x27;learning&#x27; and &#x27;acquisition&#x27; that I will discuss them in separate parts.

===Acquisition versus learning===
In linguistic and pedagogic literature, there is often a distinction made between acquisition and language learning. Children are said to &#x27;acquire&#x27; their native language, as they begin with no prior information or knowledge, whereas adults are said to &#x27;learn&#x27; a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught, and possibly unteachable process, while learning is seen as more artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

This distinction between acquisition and learning can be useful in discussing language learning, as the general conditions in the case of second language acquisition offer opportunities for acquisition, as it is informal, free, undirected, and naturalistic. Conversely, in the case of foreign language learning, educational treatment may offer opportunities primarily for learning.

However, it is important to note that acquisition can occur in the case of foreign-language learning, and learning can occur in the case of second-language learning. For example, immigrants to the US may attend language teaching classes in the target language environment, allowing for both acquisition and learning. Similarly, foreign-language learners who are far from the target language environment may still acquire language through exposure to media such as foreign radio or literature.

In conclusion, while the distinction between acquisition and learning is useful in understanding language acquisition and learning, it is important to recognize that both processes can occur in various language learning contexts. Therefore, it is essential to employ a variety of language learning strategies and techniques, tailored to the specific learner&#x27;s needs and goals, to maximize language acquisition and learning.

<doc id="1094816" wikidata="Q2873263" url="?curid=1094816" title="Avalon (American group)">
<text>Avalon Worship, originally known as Avalon, is an American contemporary Christian vocal quartet from Nashville, Tennessee, formed in 1995. The group has earned multiple RIAA-certified gold records. The group consists of Janna Long, Greg Long, Jody McBrayer, and Dani Rocca.

== Group history ==
=== 1995–97 ===
Avalon was formed in 1995 in Nashville after Norman Miller of Proper Management took the idea of a vocal group to Grant Cunningham, A&amp;R Director at Sparrow Records. Cunningham attended an artist showcase in Nashville where he heard singer Michael Passons and made Passons the first Avalon member. Former Truth vocalist and South Carolina native Janna Potter (later Janna Long) became the group&#x27;s second member.

Rikk Kittlemann and Tabitha Fair became part of the group, but each left after a short time. Long contacted McBrayer, her former Truth bandmate, who became a member of the group. Nikki Hassman-Anders was the fourth founding vocalist of Avalon. Hassman recorded two albums with Avalon, &quot;Avalon&quot; (1996) and &quot;A Maze of Grace&quot; (1997), before leaving in May 1998 to pursue a solo career with Sony Records.

=== 1998–02 ===
Cherie Paliotta (later Cherie Adams) replaced Hassman in the group. Adams recorded four albums with Avalon: &quot;In a Different Light&quot; (1999), &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;Oxygen&quot; (2001), and a remix album, &quot;O2: Avalon Remixed&quot; (March 2002).

Adams departed the group and was replaced by former Truth member Melissa Greene in September 2002.

In September 2002, McBrayer released a solo album, &quot;This Is Who I Am,&quot; that included the Top 10 duet with Jadyn Maria &quot;Never Alone (Nunca Solo)&quot; and a No. 1 single &quot;To Ever Live Without Me.&quot; Long released a self-titled solo album in October 2002 which contained the No. 2 song &quot;Greater Is He&quot;.

=== 2003–06 ===
On March 25, 2003, Avalon released a greatest hits record, &quot;Testify to Love: The Very Best of Avalon,&quot; which featured two new singles that became No. 1 hits; &quot;Everything to Me&quot; and &quot;New Day&quot;. It was the last album to include Passons.

Passons revealed in an interview in 2020 that he was forced out of Avalon due to his sexual orientation as a gay man and refusal to continue attending reparative therapy. Although a member of the group when it fired Passons, Greene has supported Passons. Passons was replaced by Long&#x27;s husband, Greg. 

On February 24, 2004, Avalon released the studio album &quot;The Creed&quot;, from which three singles were released, &quot;All&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary Christian Songs chart; &quot;You Were There,&quot; a No. 2 Inspirational Charts hit; and &quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot;.

Avalon&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Stand&quot;, was released on January 24, 2006. The single &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Leave You&quot; peaked in the Top 20 of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Christian Songs and Hot Christian Adult Contemporary charts. The single, &quot;Orphans of God&quot; peaked in the Top 5 of &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;&#x27; Inspo chart the week of August 11, 2006. &quot;Somehow You Are&quot; was released to radio in August 2006.

On October 17, 2006, Avalon released a hymns album &quot;&quot;.

=== 2007–09 ===
In 2007, McBrayer left Avalon the group after being diagnosed with a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyoparthy.

On February 26, 2008, Avalon released its ninth album, &quot;Another Time, Another Place: Timeless Christian Classics&quot;. A headlining &quot;The We Will Stand Tour&quot; followed the album&#x27;s release, with Michael English, the Daniel Doss Band, and Cadia.

The first single released from &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; was Avalon&#x27;s cover of the Twila Paris song &quot;God Is in Control.&quot; The second single, released on November 5, 2007, was a remake of the Sandi Patty/Wayne Watson song &quot;Another Time, Another Place.&quot; On November 13, 2007, Avalon released &quot;Another Time, Another Place EP&quot;, a digital EP featuring three singles from the album, &quot;God is in Control&quot; and &quot;Another Time, Another Place,&quot; and a cover of the Amy Grant song &quot;Thy Word.&quot;

Jeremi Richardson joined the group in 2007 to replace McBrayer. Richardson had sung with the group Voices of Liberty at Walt Disney World. On November 11, 2007, Greene announced at a show in Spring Arbor, Michigan, that it was the first concert with Richardson officially being a member of the group.

In 2008, EMI CMG released &quot;&quot;. The album featured a new song from Avalon, &quot;Still My God.&quot; On March 31, 2009, &quot;Still My God&quot; became Avalon&#x27;s first No. 1 single since &quot;New Day&quot; was released in 2003, from Avalon&#x27;s previous greatest hits album.

On May 15, 2009, Melissa Greene announced her resignation from Avalon upon accepting a position as Pastor of Music and Arts at GracePointe Church in Nashville.

Richardson&#x27;s wife, Amy, replaced Greene on May 21, 2009.

On May 19, 2009, Avalon recorded &quot;Reborn,&quot; its first studio album since &quot;Stand&quot; in 2006, on E1 Music, ending the group&#x27;s affiliation with Sparrow Records. The first single, &quot;Arise,&quot; was released to Christian radio in August 2009 and became Avalon&#x27;s 22nd career No. 1 radio hit, topping &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Soft AC/Inspirational chart.

=== 2018–present: &quot;Called&quot; ===
On August 7, 2018, after a decade as members of Avalon, Jeremi and Amy Richardson stopped touring. Avalon announced in their Facebook page the return of Jody McBrayer and the addition of new member, Dani Rocca. On October 24, 2018, Avalon announced that they had signed as the flagship artist with Red Street Records, a new label launched by Rascal Flatts bassist Jay DeMarcus. On November 1, 2018, they sang their debut concert as Avalon in Jacksonville, Florida on the opening night of the Greatest Hits Tour, organized by Newsong.

Avalon released &quot;Keeper of My Heart&quot; on December 7, 2019, 10 years after Avalon&#x27;s previous radio single. It was followed by a new album, &quot;Called&quot;, on February 14, 2020 and tour.

In 2022, the group rebranded under the name Avalon Worship and have released their self-titled album under this moniker.

<doc id="1094818" wikidata="Q7713072" url="?curid=1094818" title="The Alexander Brothers">
<text>The Alexander Brothers were an easy-listening folk-music duo from Scotland, who had a long career beginning in the 1950s.

==Career==
Thomas Armit &quot;Tom&quot; Alexander (25 June 1934 – 9 January 2020) and John &quot;Jack&quot; Armit Alexander (11 November 1935 – 2 November 2013) were born at Thrashbush Avenue in Cambusnethan, near Wishaw. Encouraged by their musical mother, they started instrument lessons at an early age, with Tom favouring the accordion and Jack the piano. On leaving school in the early 1950s, the brothers pursued a trade as painters and decorators by day, and entertainers by night, and spent most of their spare time performing for elderly people in hospitals and for various charitable institutions in and around their hometown. In the spring of 1958, they entered a talent contest which was held in their local cinema. They easily won the contest and one of the judges (who was a well known Scottish theatrical agent) was so impressed, he placed the boys under contract that summer. They made their professional debut at the Webster Hall, Arbroath. It was during this season that they received their first long term contract for five winter seasons at Glasgow&#x27;s Metropole Theatre. Following Arbroath they were engaged to appear at the Metropolitan Theatre, Edgware Road, London, and it was during this season they were spotted and signed to Pye Records. They cut their first LP six weeks later.

Their most popular recording was &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot; in 1964, which is said to have &quot;sold more than The Beatles in Scotland&quot;. Their other popular songs include &quot;These Are My Mountains&quot;, &quot;The Northern Lights of Old Aberdeen&quot;, &quot;Bonnie Wee Jeannie McColl&quot;, and &quot;Two Highland Lads&quot;. Their 1966 album, &quot;These Are My Mountains&quot; was their only chart success, peaking at #29 in the UK Albums Chart.
Though their popularity had peaked, the duo enjoyed a long touring career. They toured Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They appeared at the Sydney Opera House with Jimmy Shand as a guest, and also played in Carnegie Hall in New York City. A famous fan was Charlton Heston, who regularly saw them in Los Angeles. In the mid 1990s, The Alexander Brothers began to release music videos, and later DVDs, to supplement their live performances. These new recordings contained many religious or devotional songs. Their most recent CDs and DVDs were produced by Bill Garden and Dougie Stevenson of the Kilsyth based company Scotdisc.

In recognition of their contributions to the world of music, they received MBEs from the Queen in the 2005 New Year Honours List. The ceremony took place in Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh.

On 2 November 2013, Jack died aged 77. Tom continued to occasionally perform as a solo act. Tom died on 9 January 2020 aged 85.

<text>Nigel John Pegrum (born 22 January 1949) is a music producer and former drummer, most known for playing on many albums by Steeleye Span.

== Biography ==
Nigel Pegrum played drums with an early line-up of the Small Faces, then with Lee Grant And The Capitols before joining Spice, who subsequently changed their name to Uriah Heep and replaced him with a drummer who had a heavier style of playing, but not before recording the &quot;Lansdowne Tapes&quot;. These sessions have since been released under the Uriah Heep name, and feature Pegrum on drums on some tracks. He then joined the art-rock/prog-rock band Gnidrolog, where he was able to use his ability on the flute and oboe. He recorded two studio albums with them, plus a live album before playing with Halcyon and then living on a commune in Worcestershire in 1973. Steeleye Span had finally decided to use a full-time drummer and invited him to join them. Two weeks later he was touring America, with them as the supporting act for Jethro Tull. He remained with Steeleye Span for 17 years, then moved to Australia where he has recorded world-beat albums with aboriginal musicians. He rejoined Steeleye Span for a one-off project, titled &quot;The Journey&quot;, in 1995.

In 1979, Pegrum joined up with Steeleye Span bassist Rick Kemp to create Plant Life Records. A third member of Steeleye Span, Maddy Prior, released one of her albums on the label. The label&#x27;s most successful recordings were with the Tannahill Weavers. Pegrum was producer of over 30 albums on the label, which closed down in 1984. He has been a session drummer for June Tabor, Wizz Jones, Rosie Hardman and John Otway. He worked as a freelance producer before emigrating to Australia, where he works with Australian Sun Records.

Both Pegrum and Rick Kemp were members of the punk parody band the Pork Dukes in 1977, using pseudonyms.

Pegrum produced two albums of the German folk band Lorbass (&quot;Wie es uns gefällt&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Wohl bekomm&#x27;s&quot; in 1981, both on Burlington Records) on which he played drums as a guest musician.

In 1980, he joined up with the German band Stenderband with Stefan Stoppok. He recorded one album, titled &quot;Erfrischungen&quot;.

In 1982, he played the drums on the album &quot;Drucksache&quot; with the German band Bernie&#x27;s Autobahn Band.

Pegrum now operates his own recording studio, Pegasus Studios, in Whitfield, a suburb of Cairns, Queensland.

<text>Peter Franklyn Bellamy (8 September 1944 – 24 September 1991) was an English folk singer. He was a founding member of The Young Tradition and also had a long solo career, recording numerous albums and touring folk clubs and concert halls. He is noted for his ballad-opera &quot;The Transports&quot;, and has been acknowledged as a major influence by performers of later generations including Damien Barber, Oli Steadman, and Jon Boden.

==Early years==
Peter Bellamy was born in Bournemouth, England, and spent his formative years in North Norfolk, living in the village of Warham and attending Fakenham Grammar School in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His father, Richard Reynell Bellamy, worked as a farm bailiff at that time. Peter Bellamy studied at Norwich School of Art, and later at Maidstone College of Art, and decades later still retained something of the flamboyant art student image, being described as looking like a latter-day Andy Warhol, with blond hair often worn in a ponytail and tied back with a ribbon, a scarlet jacket and florally-patterned trousers which he made himself from furnishing fabric.

Encouraged by his friend Anne Briggs, he dropped out of college in 1965 to become a member of &quot;The Young Tradition&quot; with Royston Wood and Heather Wood. The trio recorded mainly traditional songs in close harmony and mostly without accompaniment. The Young Tradition projected their voices powerfully, clearly influenced by The Watersons, the Copper Family and Ewan MacColl. They recorded three albums together plus a collaboration with Shirley Collins called &quot;The Holly Bears The Crown&quot;. Although recorded in 1969, this was not released in full until the 90s.

The Young Tradition&#x27;s final concert was at Cecil Sharp House in October 1969, after which they split up, with Bellamy wanting to concentrate on traditional English music, whilst the other members had developed interests in mediaeval music.

In 1971, Bellamy recorded a collaboration with Louis Killen: &quot;Won&#x27;t You Go My Way?&quot;.

==Solo work==
Peter Bellamy&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Mainly Norfolk&quot; (1968) indicated his desire to promote the folk music of his part of England. It drew heavily on the repertoire of Harry Cox, still alive at that time, who was the most famous traditional singer of Norfolk songs. On the album, Bellamy sang all songs unaccompanied. Beginning on his second album, &quot;Fair England&#x27;s Shore&quot; (1968), he began to accompany himself on the Anglo concertina. Still later, he occasionally recorded with guitar.

It wasn&#x27;t until Bellamy&#x27;s eighth album in 1975 that he recorded any of his own compositions. In the same year he recorded a collection of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Barrack Room Ballads (see below).

Having mastered the art of putting new words to a traditional song and his own words to a traditional tune, he wrote a ballad-opera, &quot;The Transports&quot;, in 1973, but it took him 4 years to find a company willing to produce it. It then became the folk record of the year for 1977 vindicating his long wait and many efforts to get it released. Many prominent names in the folk scene collaborated on the project, including Dolly Collins (a composer, the sister of Shirley Collins), Martin Carthy, Mike Waterson, Norma Waterson, June Tabor, Nic Jones, A.L. Lloyd, Cyril Tawney and Dave Swarbrick. It told the true story of the first transport ship to land in Australia and the first couple, Henry and Susannah Cable (or Kabel), to marry on Australian soil, based on a story Peter found in the local newspaper in Norfolk and followed by his research into the details at the city museum and library. Descendants of the Kabel family still live in Sydney and became friends of Peter.
In 2004 it was re-released together with a new production involving Simon Nicol and Fairport Convention. In 1986 Sid Kipper and others devised a ballad opera called &quot;Crab Wars&quot;. It was partly a parody of &quot;The Transports&quot;, but Bellamy took it in good humour and even sang the role of narrator.

Another of Bellamy&#x27;s ambitious projects, &quot;The Maritime Suite&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 but never issued on record.

The economics of folk singing meant that Bellamy sold his own limited edition cassettes at folk clubs, and many performances exist only as pirated tapes. It is said that Celtic Records have a large cache of quality recordings that are unlikely to be issued.

Continuing his early talents with the visual arts, Bellamy generally designed his own album jackets and also drew cartoons for Fred Woods&#x27;s Folk Review magazine (for which he also showed considerable talent and fluency as a writer of reviews and features). He continued to exhibit and sell his paintings throughout his life.

Sydney Opera House once hosted a concert by him and he toured in the USA.

Although at folk clubs, and in private, he often accompanied blues on bottleneck guitar, these performances rarely appeared on his albums: an exception is an attenuated version of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Stones in My Passway&quot;, on the Young Tradition&#x27;s &quot;Galleries&quot;. A hiss redolent of an old 78 record was added, but this joke misfired: a Transatlantic Records press officer later told interviewer Michael Grosvenor Myer that quite a few copies were returned as &#x27;faulty&#x27; as a result!

In 2009 Topic Records included in their 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; &quot;When I Die&quot; from &quot;Both Sides Then&quot; as track nine of the second CD.

==Recording Kipling&#x27;s ballads==
Bellamy started his exploration of Kipling as a source for songs, not with the &quot;Barrack Room Ballads&quot; but with the songs from Kipling&#x27;s Children&#x27;s books, (&quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; and &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;) from which he produced two albums, &quot;Oak Ash and Thorn&quot; and &quot;Merlyn&#x27;s Isle of Gramarye&quot;.

Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Barrack Room Ballads&quot; were published in 1892, and Bellamy started setting them to music in 1973. He was struck by people&#x27;s misconceptions about Kipling, who many perceived as (in Bellamy&#x27;s words) &quot;one of the reactionary old guard, and therefore obviously a writer of no merit whatsoever&quot;. In reality, Kipling had captured a real insight into the attitudes of the ordinary soldiers, such as their contempt for those civilians who would shrug the soldiers off during peacetime but will encourage and cheer them on when the soldiers are leaving for battle:
&lt;poem&gt;It&#x27;s Tommy this, an&#x27; Tommy that, an&#x27; &#x27;Chuck him out, the brute!&#x27;
But it&#x27;s &#x27;Saviour of &#x27;is country&#x27; when the guns begin to shoot.
An&#x27; it&#x27;s Tommy this, an&#x27; Tommy that, an&#x27; anything you please;
An&#x27; Tommy ain&#x27;t a bloomin&#x27; fool – you bet that Tommy sees!&quot; (Tommy)
&lt;/poem&gt;

When composing the musical settings for Kipling&#x27;s poetry, Bellamy had a theory, shared with many others, that highly metrical poets like Kipling used song tunes to keep their poems flowing properly. Some of Kipling&#x27;s contemporaries confirm that he was in the habit of humming and whistling as he composed. It has, for example, been claimed that in &quot;The Loot&quot;, there is a &quot;hidden&quot; tune being worked to, and that nothing else can explain the strange refrains. Bellamy became excited when the line in &quot;Dutch in the Medway&quot; &quot;our ships in every harbour...&quot; reminded him of the line in the song &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Garden&quot; &quot;Twas down in Portsmouth Harbour...&quot;. This observation suggested the tune for the Kipling poem and made him wonder whether Kipling had actually composed to that tune, it being a common folk song in the 19th century and certainly part of the repertoire of the remarkable Copper family of Sussex who had lived in Rottingdean when Kipling was also living there. (A local man called Copper appears briefly in &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;.) It has also been suggested that Kipling&#x27;s &quot;My name is O&#x27;Kelly, I&#x27;ve heard the reveille...&quot; was written to the common Irish song and Army marching tune &quot;Lillibullero&quot;. Bellamy found a different tune but agreed that &quot;Lillibullero&quot; was more likely to have been on Kipling&#x27;s mind at the time of composition.

Initially, Bellamy&#x27;s proposal to record the Ballads was vetoed by Kipling&#x27;s daughter, and he had to wait until her death in 1976 before permission was finally granted by the Kipling Society.

The &quot;Barrack Room Ballads&quot; album was recorded by Bill Leader, with Chris Birch (brother of Bellamy&#x27;s first wife) on fiddle and Tony Hall on melodeon. Chris also contributed to numerous other Bellamy albums, playing fiddle and guitar, singing and providing vocal arrangements. The Kipling Society went on to appreciate Bellamy&#x27;s contribution to Kipling&#x27;s legacy and he was elected a Fellow of the Kipling Society, becoming a vice-president in 1981.

A tribute album &quot;Oak, Ash and Thorn&quot; comprising songs from Bellamy&#x27;s &quot;Oak, Ash &amp; Thorn&quot; and &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Isle of Gramarye&quot;, was released in 2011, with contributions from artists including Jon Boden, Olivia Chaney, Charlie Parr, Fay Hield, Tim Eriksen, Trembling Bells, The Unthanks, Jackie Oates, Sam Lee, Lisa Knapp and The Owl Service.

==Death==
Bellamy died by suicide on 24 September 1991 in Keighley, an event that baffled many in the folk music community. At the time, he was working with Fellside Records on a project to record major British unaccompanied singing talents. However, according to a thread called &#x27;Boring, Bleating Old Traddy&#x27; on the online Mudcat Cafe folk music forum, several of his friends had found him depressed at the way his folk club bookings had unaccountably fallen away after the respect with which &quot;The Transports&quot; had been received. Folk music journalist and critic Michael Grosvenor Myer, one of those who had named &quot;The Transports&quot; his record of the year in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he was subsequently to write his obituary, relates how Bellamy showed him an empty engagement book, saying, in sad and puzzled tones, &quot;&quot;The Transports&quot; was a runaway success, since when my career has gone ppppffff!&quot; Similarly from fellow folksinger Brian Peters: &quot;The saddest Bellamy moment arose after I&#x27;d complimented him on a barnstorming performance the last time I&#x27;d seen him. With a wan smile, he picked up his diary and, holding it up for me to see, leafed through empty page after empty page, without saying a word.&quot; American folksinger Lisa Null, a longtime friend, writes &quot;He was broke, unable to find gigs, unable to adapt. He complained so much about this, many of us kind of got used to it -- a bad mistake. He was sending out warning signs.&quot; Another singer, Nick Dow, adds, &quot;In respect of his empty gig diary, we were chatting on the phone, and he asked me &#x27;Nick how do you get so much work?&#x27; I answered that it was because I was a persuasive bastard and wasn&#x27;t averse to making a nuisance of myself. He replied that he couldn&#x27;t easily ring up and ask for a gig, he found it so embarrassing. He was a singer and performer, not a businessman in any shape or form. Peter needed our help, and the oxygen of the appreciation of his art.&quot;

Shortly before his death, his widow, Jenny, later told Michael Grosvenor Myer, he had spent a whole day listening intently and self-critically to his entire record output, saying at the end &quot;But I am good. What the hell has gone wrong?&quot;
Karl Dallas&#x27;s obituary published in &quot;The Independent&quot; concluded with the words:
His life and work were fondly celebrated by a day of performances including &quot;The Transports&quot; at Conway Hall in London on 2 October 1992, 13 months after his death. Heather Wood, his erstwhile Young Tradition colleague now living in New York, came over specifically to be present on the occasion.

==Vocal singing style==
Bellamy had a distinctive singing style. In a &quot;Borfolk&quot; cartoon in the October 1980 edition of &quot;Southern Rag&quot;, commenting on an event at Cecil Sharp House compered by Peter Bellamy, he was given the anagrammatical name &quot;Elmer P. Bleaty&quot;, a humorous comment on the slightly nasal vibrato of his voice. (Peter Bellamy later obtained, framed and hung the original of the cartoon in his home.)

Folk singer Jon Boden is a fan of Peter&#x27;s bellowing style. He has jocularly put on his website &quot;Bellamists subscribe to a belief in the absolute purity and oneness of all things Bellamy, and bleat daily incantations in the hope of advancing the day when he will finally return to reign in ever-lasting glory.&quot; He was himself good-natured, and even a bit proprietorial, about references to his style as &quot;bleating&quot;. In addition to the self-given sobriquet of &quot;boring bleating old traddy&quot;, picked out in letters on a Scrabble board on a self-designed record-sleeve photograph by Valerie Grosvenor Myer and used, as noted above, as title of a Mudcat Cafe thread, and to the anagrammatic name attributed to the cartoon character based on him mentioned in the previous paragraph, he once rejoined to a &quot;Folk Review&quot; magazine correspondent, who had attributed to his influence a preponderance of (Toytown character) &quot;Larry the Lamb&quot; imitators in folk clubs, &quot;Larry the Lamb imitations, dear Madam, are strictly my copyright!&quot;

<doc id="1094832" wikidata="Q3303572" url="?curid=1094832" title="Mbula language">
<text>Mbula (also known as Mangap-Mbula, Mangaaba, Mangaawa, Mangaava, Kaimanga) is an Austronesian language spoken by around 2,500 people on Umboi Island and Sakar Island in the Morobe Province of Papua New Guinea. Its basic word order is subject–verb–object; it has a nominative–accusative case-marking strategy.

==Name==
Mbula speakers generally display difficulty expressing a name for their language. Historically it has been referenced as &quot;Mangap&quot; or &quot;Kaimanga&quot; but &quot;Kaimanga&quot; is considered an offensive term along the lines of &quot;unsophisticated bush person&quot;. &quot;Mangap&quot; is not in known use; however, &quot;Mangaaba&quot; is the name given to Mbula speakers by Siassi Islanders. &quot;Mbula&quot; is the only name known to have been used by Mbula speakers themselves, though many of them are unfamiliar with this.

==Language family and origin==
Mbula is a member of the Oceanic group of Austronesian languages. It was originally proposed as a member of the Siassi language group which is a set of languages extending from Karkar Island in the Madang Province of Papua New Guinea, along the coast of Finschafen and across New Britain. However, more recent evidence suggests that it is a descendant of the Vitiaz Dialect Linkage. Its nearest genetic relations are the Kilenge and Maleu languages; its nearest geographic neighbour is the Papuan Kovai language.

==Location==
Mbula speakers are generally located in seven villages: Gaura, Yangla, Birik, Marile, Kampalap, Kabi and Sakar. These villages are located on Sakar Island and the eastern half of Umboi Island. Both islands are inactive volcanoes and both are rich in game, timber and fish. Location has influenced the language in that there are many specific vocabulary items for species of fish, shells, canoes, nets, spears and a pair of motion verbs &#x27;to go out, appear, happen&#x27; and &#x27;to enter&#x27; which specifically describe paths of motion which are radially outward toward the sea or radially inward from the sea.

==People and culture==
Colonialism has had a fair impact on the culture of Mbula speakers. Missionization began in 1884 and the vast majority of Mbula speakers now identify themselves as Christian. Some traditions are retained from tribal religions; foremost among them are those concerning sorcery, white magic and divination. Two general types of magic are identified among speakers, , a beneficial love magic used by many young men in their pursuit of young ladies and , a kind of mildly destructive magic used to curse and hurt others. A third kind, , is considered the most evil, used only to kill or disable people.

==Language contact==
The Mangap-Mbula are part of a previously extensive trading network with bordering language groups, especially those in the Ngero language group of the Siassi islands which formed the hub of the trading network. As a result, approximately 65% of Mbula speakers are at least somewhat bilingual in Tok Pisin and some 30% speak and understand some Ngero. Due to missionization and other factors, 35% can speak and write English.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The consonant phonemes of Mbula are as shown in the following table:

The consonant is realised as intervocalically. Prenasalised stops, while requiring two phonetic units, exist as a single phonemic unit. The palatal glide is treated as being underlyingly vocalic in morphophonemic analysis while the labio-velar glide is analysed consonantally. All voiceless plosives, , are optionally pronounced with a voiceless nasal release word finally. All velars are fronted or backed, depending on the vowel immediately contiguous to them within the same syllable. is palatalized to a voiceless, laminal, post-alveolar plosive when followed by a morpheme boundary and .

===Vowels===
Mbula has five vowel phonemes as shown in the following table. Phonetically front vowels are unrounded and back vowels are rounded. and can be lax or tense and can be half close tense and half open lax. All vowels can be short or long, though this is interpreted in the phonology as a sequence of two vowels rather than as the existence of long vowel phonemes. The two high vowels and are lowered slightly when followed by , , or .

Vowels are subject to two rules: penultimate lengthening, which means that external realisations may be long vowels while the underlying form is a short vowel, and epenthesis, which means the insertion of a vowel where the underlying form of the morpheme does not contain one. Epenthesis is regressive, which means that epenthetic vowels take on the quality of the first vowel in the rest of the form. Vowel length is contrastive as can be seen in the following examples:

===Suprasegmentals===
The placement of stress is predictable. In most words, primary stress falls on the penultimate syllable.

===Syllable patterns===
Syllable structure is generally (C)V(C). VV can sometimes form a syllable in the case of a diphthong or long vowel and syllable structure can be analysed as CCV when or is analysed as a C.

==Orthography==
As stated above, vowel length is contrastive. What would be written phonetically as a: is represented by aa. All long vowels are written this way. All alveolars () are dental-alveolars. They are represented in the orthography by t, d, n and nd. The sound is represented by y. The complete orthography of Mbula is as follows:

==Syntax and word classes==
In an ideal grammar each classificatory word type would belong only to one category and in Mbula that is mostly the case. However, in the following three areas, word forms exist which are hard to nail down as one or the other:

#verbs and prepositions
#verbs and adverbs
#verbs and instrumental nouns

The occurrence of a form in a wide range of conversational environments can result in the gradual loss of morphological features which are not appropriate to some particular conversational environments as well as the morphological gain of features which are appropriate to other conversational environments. This can mean ultimately either category shift of a word class or even just the general greying of the word classes as iron-clad categories.

===Verbs and prepositions===
Prototypical verbs and prototypical prepositions exist along a cline with verbs at the start, prepositions at the end, and multicategoried word types in the middle:

#forms inflected with the subject prefixes which function syntactically only as predicates in sentences
#forms not inflected with the subject prefixes which syntactically function only as predicates in sentences (the uninflected verbs discussed below in verbs)
#forms potentially exhibiting subject agreement inflection which function syntactically as both predicates in sentences and in serial constructions (the prepositional verbs discussed below)
#forms never exhibiting inflection and which function syntactically only as prepositions

===Verbs and adverbs===
Prototypical verbs and adverbs exist along a cline with verbs at the start, adverbs at the end and multicategoried word types in the middle:

#inflected verbs which never occur as modifiers within the predicate phrase and never occur in cosubordinate adverbial predications
#inflected verbs which never occur as modifiers within the predicate phrase, and can occur in either a preceding or following cosubordinate adverbial predication
#uninflected verbs which never occur as modifiers within the predicate phrase, but which can occur in either a preceding or following cosubordinate adverbial predication
#forms which can occur as modifiers in the predicate phrase after the object or occur as uninflected verbs in an adjacent cosubordinate adverbial predication
#forms which occur immediately after the object and never function as predicates in an adjacent cosubordinate adverbial construction
#forms which can occur immediately after the predicate and never function as a predicate in an adjacent cosubordinate adverbial construction

===Verbs and instrumental nouns===
Verbs and instrumental nouns crossover in that verbs theoretically derived from these nouns appear in an identical form. I.e., there is no overt morphological derivation which might indicate what direction the derivation has occurred in. Examples include:

* – &#x27;wall&#x27;
* – &#x27;to wall in&#x27;
* – &#x27;paddle&#x27;
* – &#x27;to paddle&#x27;
* – implement for sweeping
* – &#x27;to sweep up&#x27; using this implement
* – &#x27;a line&#x27;
* – &#x27;to draw a line&#x27;

===Nouns===
There is no syntactic distinction between nouns and adjectives in Mbula. Nouns are syntactically distinguished by the following three characteristics:

#They may function &#x27;in isolation&#x27; (i.e. without any further syntactic modification) as arguments in a predication, a property that distinguishes them from non-inflecting stative verbs.
#When functioning as the heads of noun phrases, nouns occur phrase initially with all modifiers following.
#A subclass of nouns is morphologically distinguished by being obligatorily inflected with a set of genitive suffixes.

There are eight semantic features of noun referents which are especially important for characterising the morphosyntactic behaviour of Mbula nouns:

#human referent
#animate referent
#potent (the referent of the noun can be viewed as the ultimate cause of some process which affects another entity)
#concrete (the noun can potentially refer to a physical location to which, at which, or from which an event takes place)
#temporal (the noun may be used to delineate the time at which an event takes place)
#potentially consumable (the referent of the noun can be eaten or drunk)
#individuated/count (the referent of the noun may be easily separated from its environment and may not be divided without changing its essential nature/character)
#inalienable genitive (the referent of the item is inherently associated with some other entity)

===Pronouns===
Pronouns make the following person/number distinctions.

*1 singular
*1 dual exclusive
*1 dual inclusive
*1 plural exclusive
*1 plural inclusive
*2 singular
*2 dual
*2 plural
*3 singular
*3 dual
*3 plural

Pronouns also inflect for nominative, accusative, referent and locative cases. Most pronouns are composed of an initial case marker plus a person-number marker. The nominative series of pronouns is generally used to encode animate participants which function as subjects. There are three demonstrative pronouns: (&#x27;this one, these ones&#x27;), (&#x27;that one, those ones&#x27;) and (&#x27;that one over there, those ones over there&#x27;). Accusative pronouns encode animate participants which function as objects. The referent pronouns encode virtually any animate oblique argument. Locative pronouns indicate an animate location toward which an action is taking place in dynamic predications, or at which an item is located. The locative form is also used to encode possession. Interrogative pronouns such as who, when, where, operate in a replacement fashion. That is, the interrogative pronoun is used in place of the normal syntactic position of the item being questioned.

===Verbs===
The characteristic syntactic function of verbs is to act as the heads of predications in which they occur. They are defined by a number of properties:

#They typically index the person and number of the subject of the sentence.
#They may contain transitivity-altering prefixes.
#They may not function as noun-phrase modifiers in certain frames.

====Uninflected verbs====
There are several categories of non-inflecting verbs in Mbula:

#stative experiential verbs
#stative verbs encoding properties
#verbs of manner
#aspectual verbs

All of these non-inflecting verbs function only as predicates in clauses. Thus they cannot function as heads of noun phrases and they cannot function as restrictive modifiers of nouns unless they are relativised or nominalised. Syntactically, they resemble inflected verbs. They are only distinguished from other verbs morphologically.

===Adverbials===
This class is called &quot;adverbials&quot; and not &quot;adverbs&quot; because Mbula contains a large collection of words which are defined as modifiers of constituents other than nouns. Semantically, such forms typically encode notions of time, aspect, manner and modality.

===Quantifiers===
Quantifiers are uninflected forms which always occur in noun phrases following nouns, locative/alienable genitive pronouns, and attributive stative nouns, but before determiners, locative/alienable genitive prepositional phrases, relative clauses and demonstratives. The Mbula counting system is based upon the notions of five and twenty.

===Prepositions===
Prepositions are generally uninflected forms which govern a single noun phrase complement and relate it to a head or predicate. Mbula employs five categories of prepositions:

#the referent preposition used for oblique arguments
#the locative preposition used for animate goals towards which some entity moves, sites at which some entity is located and body parts which perceive something
#the preposition used to express resemblance, similarity or approximate equality (i.e., like, as)
#the comitative and manner prepositions used for accompaniment and manner
#prepositional verbs discussed below

====Prepositional verbs====
These forms are a set of optionally inflected verbs which occur in serialisations functioning as case markers. As they may potentially contain inflection for third person singular in these serialisations, they depart from the typical uninflected preposition. However, they retain the prepositional function of relating a dependent noun phrase to a verbal head.

===Demonstratives===
====Historical demonstratives and deictic expressions====
Regarding the deictic term for &#x27;that, there&#x27;, there does not seem to be a major change in the pronunciation of the term in Mangap-Mbula () from Proto-Malayo Polynesian (PMP; ). However, the context in which is used has narrowed, as it is used anaphorically to mean &#x27;that&#x27;.

====Morpho-syntactic features====
&quot;Demonstrative pronouns and spatial deictic expressions&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Mangap-Mbula has three different free demonstrative pronouns which do not differentiate between singular and plural:

In Example 1, is a free demonstrative used situationally and functions as a modifier of a singular noun phrase, as it is introducing the &#x27;younger brother&#x27;. Additionally, also has two other functions. The first is as the modal adverb meaning &#x27;this is true now&#x27;, and the second as a morphological part of the demonstratives and .

 functions similarly to the third person pronouns and . It is frequently being used to refer to non-humans, and its main function is to reestablish a participant, who has already been introduced, as a topic or to single them out. In Example 2, is referring to two non-human, singular entities: the wallaby and the tree kangaroo. As the direct translation for each of these entities were not mentioned here, it can be inferred that they are both used anaphorically.

In Example 3, is a free demonstrative used situationally and conveys two pieces of information: (1) the entity to which it is referring to, and (2) its location in reference to the speaker (i.e. a place adverb).

&quot;Locative adverbial forms&quot;&lt;br&gt;
In Mangap-Mbula, there are no differences between deictic expressions that denote noun phrases and ones that denote location in sentences. Thus, they are considered as being a single form class.

In Examples 4 and 5, is used situationally as a place adverb for where a group of people work and where in relation to the speaker, is the house located, respectively.

&quot;Problems with prepositions&quot;



Examples 6, 7, and 8 demonstrate that the demonstrative and the adverbial are semantically and positionally similar to the preposition phrase . This resemblance suggests that both could potentially fall under the same category of prepositional phrases, which further suggests that prepositions could be split into a transitive (location adverbs and demonstratives) and intransitive (true prepositions) sub-category. However, viewing things this way could have two issues: (1) the adverbial would have to be left as being noun phrase modifiers, but this could be due to the semantics; (2) the noun phrase shows the demonstrative occurring after the &#x27;true&#x27; prepositiona&#x27; phrase with the noun phrase complement. But if both are deemed as coming from the syntactic group, why then would there be an ordering restriction? As a result of these problems, a demonstrative form class is recognised.

&quot;Noun phrases&quot;



In the examples given above, is used situationally as a determiner for either the chicken (Example 9), the woman (Example 10) or the tree (Example 11). refers to the specific entity (i.e. &#x27;that&#x27;), and refers to the entity that has already been revealed in the sentence. In Example 10 however, the woman is not present situationally, but is referred to hypothetically.

There are two functions of : (1) as a demonstrative, or (2) to convey reason-result sequences. They are homophones. The demonstrative denotes (1) entities that are accessible or nearby the speaker and (2) textually revealed participants.

&quot;Motion verbs&quot;

Similar to many other Oceanic languages, Mangap-Mbula makes a three-way distinction depending on relative space: near speaker, near hearer or near neither. This sense of deictic orientation can be conveyed in motion verbs through the use of suffixes. These verbs often compound the root (which states the spatial positioning of motion) and the deictic orientation of motion in regards to the speaker and listener. This is shown in Table 2.

These are some examples:



These are all examples of bound deictic morphemes.

====Aerial comparison====

Other Oceanic languages which share the same pronunciation for the term (meaning &#x27;that, there&#x27;) have a slightly different meaning, such as Suau and Motu, where means &#x27;this&#x27;, and Chuukese, where means &#x27;there it is (by you)&#x27;. There are also other Oceanic languages with a closer meaning to Mangap-Mbula&#x27;s , but have an additional sound at the beginning. They are Dobuan (where means &#x27;that&#x27;) and Nakanamanga (where means &#x27;that (distant)&#x27;).

Mangap-Mbula is a noun-demonstrative order language. This order is usual for neighbouring languages in the Morobe Province, such as Sio and Selepet, as well as in West New Britain, such as Maleu and Amara. Examples 9, 10 and 11 demonstrate this lexical ordering.

===Complementizers===
Complementisers are uninflected forms which only govern a following sentence. The combination of a complementiser and a following sentence becomes the constituent in a noun or predicate phrase. Mbula contains seven types of complementiser:

# – lest (I don&#x27;t want this to happen)
# ~ nothing – non-presupposition of factuality (I do not say this is something which has happened)
# – like (I think like this)
#nothing – asserted factuality (I say this is something which has happened or is happening)
# ~ nothing – presupposed factuality (I know that this is something which has happened and I think you know about it too)
# – presupposed non-factuality (I know that this is something which has not happened and I think you know about it)
# – habitual event (This is the kind of thing that is always happening)

===Conjunctions===
There are a great deal of conjunctions in Mbula that each encode their own subtly different meaning. However, all conjunctions fall broadly into four categories: temporal conjunctions, conditional conjunctions, causal conjunctions and disjunctions.

===Interjections===
There are a number of interjections in Mbula, all of which play no role in the grammar of the language, but which function to convey the speaker&#x27;s attitudes and intentions. They always occur sentence initially and include the following examples:

* – I want to say something
* – I want something
* – I hear something, I don&#x27;t know what it is
* – I don&#x27;t know
* – I want to ask you something
* – I do not agree with you
* – I say you did something good
* – I think you are bad

==Morphology==
Word structure in the Mbula language is not complex. There is little inflection of both nouns and verbs and few derivational processes. Most words in Mbula are mono-morphemic. Multi-morphemic words can be formed via the following processes:

*indexing on verbs for the person and number of the Subject
*inflection of inalienable nouns for the person and number of their genitives
*reduplication
*derivation of predicates to increase or decrease their transitivity
*compounding
*nominalisation

These processes will be discussed below.

===Inflectional morphology===
The only types of inflectional processes in the language are on verbs for the person and number of the subject, inflection of inalienable nouns for the person and number of their genitives as well as pronoun person/number distinctions.

====Verbal inflection====
Verbs typically index the person and number of the subject of the sentence with the following set of subject prefixes:

====Inflection of inalienable nouns====
Mbula contains a class of nouns which are obligatorily inflected with genitive suffixes. &quot;Inalienable&quot; describes the semantic nature of the nouns. That is, they are semantically considered in speakers’ minds to be inalienable or inseparable from something. Examples include body parts and family members – concepts which exist in relation to something else, just the way an edge cannot exist without being the edge of something. Following is a list of the genitive suffixes:

====Pronoun inflection====
Pronouns in Mbula inflect for first, second and third person as well as singular, dual and plural, as well as inclusive and exclusive in the first person. They also change depending on whether they are in the nominative, accusative, referent or locative case. The following table details the paradigm:

===Derivational morphology===
The following types of derivation occur in Mbula: compounding of nouns and verbs, creation of nouns by means other than compounding, derivational devices which alter the transitivity of verbs, reduplication and some other minor processes. Compounding is not a very productive process in Mbula though is far more common in verbs than in nouns. Verbs can compound with adverbs, nouns and other verbs to create verbs. Nouns are more likely to be derived by the nominalising suffix . When combined with adverbs it yields stative nouns; with nouns it can either signal an intensification of meaning or a slight change in meaning (with no intensification); it turns stative verbs into stative nouns and dynamic verbs into nouns. Semantically, derivations tend to convey the idea of generic, habitual or characteristic actions. A further nominalisation suffix exists but is far less productive than . Transitivity of predicates can be altered by the addition of one or more of the following prefixes: , , and , and these are extremely productive processes. Finally, reduplication can result in any one of the following meanings: plurality, distribution, intensification, diminution or habitual-durative action (action that is somehow extended).

<text>Plant Life Records was a record label that existed from 1977 until 1984. It was formed by Nigel Pegrum, at that time drummer for Steeleye Span. Maddy Prior recorded one album for the label, as did Wizz Jones in 1977. Its most successful recordings were by The Tannahill Weavers and Blowzabella. Most of the thirty or so albums were produced by Pegrum and seven were produced by Paul James. Late in its life, the label began issuing records under licence from other labels and was linked to the Burlington record label, which was also issued with the Plant Life logo on the later labels.

<doc id="1094838" wikidata="Q1028007" url="?curid=1094838" title="Grave (band)">
<text>Grave is a Swedish death metal band that was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Ola Lindgren who is their only constant member. The band had particular success in the early 1990s, and their first four albums, &quot;Into the Grave&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never See...&quot;, &quot;Soulless&quot; and &quot;Hating Life&quot;, cemented their reputation as one of Sweden&#x27;s foremost death metal bands. Grave went on hiatus in 1997, but got back together two years later. Since then, they have released seven more albums, making a total of eleven studio albums. Along with Dismember, Entombed and Unleashed, Grave is considered one of the &quot;big four&quot; of Swedish death metal.

== History ==
=== Early career (1986–1993) ===
The band started in 1986 under the name Corpse and changed it to Grave in 1988. They recorded various demos from 1986 to 1991, and recorded some singles and EPs as well. Their debut full-length album &quot;Into the Grave&quot; was released in 1991. The release led to a European and American tour.

In 1992, the band released their second album &quot;You&#x27;ll Never See...&quot;, which was a continuation of the style featured on their debut. However, bassist Jonas Torndal left the band as a result of his increasing dislike for touring. After unsuccessfully trying to find a replacement, the group made a decision to become a trio, with guitarist Jörgen Sandström switching to bass. A European tour followed with compatriots Dismember and headliner Morbid Angel.

=== Two more albums, hiatus and return (1994–2003) ===
The band&#x27;s third album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Soulless&quot;, showed a somewhat different style, blending more experimental and industrial tones into the death metal of the previous album. Sandström departed in 1996, and Lindgren took over the vocals on their fourth album &quot;Hating Life&quot;. This album progressed further into the style started on &quot;Soulless&quot;. Another European and American tour followed, which resulted in the live album &quot;Extremely Rotten Live&quot;. Thereafter, the band more or less split up.

1999 was the first year the members rejoined and started rehearsing; nevertheless the band took it slow. Ultimately this led to a warm-up European tour and a new album in 2002. &quot;Back from the Grave&quot; was a return to the style featured on their second album, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never See...&quot;, with minimal influence from &quot;Soulless&quot;. As a bonus, a CD containing three demo recordings was included with the album.

=== &quot;Fiendish Regression&quot; and &quot;As Rapture Comes&quot; (2004–2007) ===
The 2004 album &quot;Fiendish Regression&quot; saw the departure of drummer Paulsson, who was replaced by Coercion drummer Pelle Ekegren. This album showcased more aggressive and generally somewhat faster songs. Touring followed through Europe in conjunction with the Canadian band Cryptopsy.

Two years later in 2006, &quot;As Rapture Comes&quot; was released, further increasing the overall speed and aggression of the band&#x27;s musical style. Noteworthy is the inclusion of the Alice in Chains cover of &quot;Them Bones&quot;. In support of the album the band toured with Dismember, Vital Remains, Demiricous, and Withered through the US and Canada. In November 2006 they toured Europe as part of the Masters of Death tour, with Unleashed, Dismember, Entombed and Exterminator.
In September, Grave embarked on a European tour with Nile for their album &quot;Ithyphallic&quot;.

=== Recent years (2008–present) ===
In 2008 the band returned with their eighth full-length studio album &quot;Dominion VIII&quot;. Stylistically it stepped back to the band&#x27;s old-school death metal roots. The next album, &quot;Burial Ground&quot;, continued the same style. In 2010, Fredrik Isaksson left the lineup and was replaced by Dismember&#x27;s Tobias Cristiansson.

In July 2011, it was reported that Grave was expected to begin recording their tenth album that fall and have it out in 2012. Titled &quot;Endless Procession of Souls&quot;, it was released on 27 August 2012, in Europe and in North America on the next day.

Grave released their eleventh studio album &quot;Out of Respect for the Dead&quot; in October 2015. On 4 September the band revealed the cover artwork of the album, which was created by Costin Chioreanu.

On 1 December 2017, Grave announced their split with their drummer for eleven years Ronnie Bergerståhl; six months later, the band hired Tomas Lagrén as his replacement. Grave has been in the process of working on a new album.

In January 2024, both Tobias Cristiansson and Mika Lagrén parted ways with the band. Live shows were canceled indefinitely.

In August 2024, the original line-up of Jorgen Sandström, Jens Paulsson and Jonas Torndal returned to perform their first three albums at Party.San Metal Open Air 2025. Lindgren later stated that the reunited original line-up had no further plans to tour or record.

<doc id="1094840" wikidata="Q2058454" url="?curid=1094840" title="First Battle of Newbury">
<text>The First Battle of Newbury was a battle of the First English Civil War that was fought on 20 September 1643 between a Royalist army, under the personal command of King Charles, and a Parliamentarian force led by the Earl of Essex. Following a year of Royalist battlefield successes, in which they took Banbury, Oxford and Reading without conflict before storming Bristol, the Parliamentarians were left without an effective army in the west of England. When Charles laid siege to Gloucester, Parliament was forced to muster a force under Essex with which to beat Charles&#x27; forces off. After a long march, Essex surprised the Royalists and forced them away from Gloucester before beginning a retreat to London. Charles rallied his forces and pursued Essex, overtaking the Parliamentarian army at Newbury and forcing them to march past the Royalist force to continue their retreat.

Essex reacted by making a surprise attack on the Royalist lines at dawn, capturing several pieces of high ground and leaving Charles on the back foot. A series of Royalist attacks led to a large number of casualties and the slow retreat of Essex&#x27;s force, which was driven from the central hill and almost encircled; Essex succeeded in rallying his infantry, however, and pushed forward in a counter-attack. The slowing of this counter-attack in the face of the Royalist cavalry forced Essex to send for reinforcements, which, while marching to him, were attacked and forced to retreat. This left a hole in the Parliamentarian line, dividing the army into two wings through which the Royalists hoped to pass, splitting the Parliamentarians and allowing Charles&#x27;s troops to encircle and defeat them. In line with this, the Royalists moved forward to press the attack, but were forced to halt by the London Trained Bands. With night falling, the battle ended, and both exhausted armies disengaged. The next morning, low on ammunition, the Royalists were forced to allow Essex to pass and continue his retreat to London.

Reasons for the Royalist failure to defeat the Parliamentarians include shortage of ammunition, the relative lack of professionalism of their soldiers and the tactics of Essex, who compensated &quot;for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower&quot;, countering Prince Rupert&#x27;s cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations. Although the numbers of casualties were relatively small (1,300 Royalists and 1,200 Parliamentarians), historians who have studied the battle consider it to be one of the most crucial of the First English Civil War, marking the high point of the Royalist advance and leading to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant, which brought the Scottish Covenanters into the war on the side of Parliament and led to the eventual victory of the Parliamentarian cause.

==Background==
When the war started, both sides expected it to be settled by one battle; by the end of 1642, it soon became clear that that would not be the case. After the inconclusive Battle of Edgehill in October, the Royalists advanced on London; after they were halted at the Turnham Green in November, Charles established his capital at Oxford. The Earl of Essex, commander of the main Parliamentarian army, was ordered to take Oxford, and on 27 April, captured Reading. Here he remained until mid-May, claiming he was unable to advance further without additional supplies, and money.

Despite the stalemate outside Oxford, Royalist success elsewhere provided an opportunity for a decisive victory. In the south-west, Royalist commander Sir Ralph Hopton secured Cornwall with victory at Braddock Down in January, before inflicting a serious defeat on Waller&#x27;s &#x27;Army of the Western Association&#x27; at Roundway Down on 13 July. Arguably the most comprehensive Royalist victory of the war, it isolated Parliament&#x27;s garrisons in the west; reinforced by troops from Oxford under Prince Rupert, on 26 July they captured Bristol, gaining the second largest city in Britain.

===Bristol===
Despite this, Royalist forces were significantly depleted by the battle at Bristol. Suffering over 1,000 men dead, and having exhausted their supplies, the armies were forced to regroup. Even considering this, the capture of Bristol is considered the high-water mark for the Royalist cause during the First English Civil War. With the city captured, however, an immediate dispute occurred over who was to govern it, and this led to Charles travelling there on 1 August to take personal command of the Royalist forces. Upon arriving he summoned his council of war to discuss their next move, the primary questions at hand being &quot;first, whether the armies should be united, and march in one upon the next design. And then, what the design should be&quot;. The western army, although still strong, refused to advance further to the east due to the presence of Parliamentarian forces within Dorset and Cornwall; the army&#x27;s commanders felt that if they tried to push for such a move, their forces would either mutiny or simply desert.

Because of this unrest, it was quickly resolved that the western army would remain an independent fighting force and remain in Dorset and Cornwall to &quot;mop up&quot; the remaining Parliamentarians. Accordingly, the western army, commanded by Lord Carnarvon, remained in the region, capturing Dorchester in a bloodless victory on 2 August. Prince Maurice left 1,200 infantry and approximately 200 cavalry to garrison Bristol before marching to Dorchester and personally taking command. The greater issues were what to do with the Oxford army and what the &quot;next design&quot; of the Royalist campaign would be. Rupert&#x27;s strategy was to advance through the Severn Valley and capture Gloucester, which would allow Royalist forces in south Wales to reinforce Charles&#x27;s army and thus allow for an assault on London. Another faction, however, argued that London could be captured with the army as it was, and that Gloucester would serve as a distraction from the main goal of the campaign.

By 6 August, it was clear that Rupert&#x27;s strategy would be abandoned; instead, an alternate means of capturing the city was considered. During the early stages of the war, the loyalty of combatants on both sides, particularly that of professional soldiers, had been flexible. Gloucester was led by Edward Massie, a non-partisan mercenary who only took a job with the Parliamentarians after he was refused a significant Royalist command. At the same time, it was felt that there was &quot;a strong if so far silent party of Royalist sympathisers in the city&quot;, while the governor of Sudeley Castle was reporting that Gloucester&#x27;s soldiers had stated they would not resist a Royalist advance. Given this, the council of war decided to march on Gloucester – not to besiege it or capture it by force, but to capture it by having the governor betray the city beforehand. William Legge, who had served with Massie in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, contacted him and asked him to &quot;surrender Gloucester to his lawful sovereign&quot;. Although this message was rebuffed, Legge&#x27;s messenger reported that he had met Massie a second time in secret, and had been asked to tell Legge that Massie was willing to surrender the town to the King. As a result of this, on 7 August Charles and the Oxford army marched to Gloucester.

===Gloucester===

Charles&#x27;s main force began marching on 7 August and reached the village of Painswick a day later; however, Rupert&#x27;s cavalry screen had already advanced and taken the village. Charles himself did not accompany the force, but instead rode across the Cotswolds to Rendcomb, where he met reinforcements from Oxford on 9 August. On the morning of 10 August, the Royalist army marched to Gloucester itself and besieged the city with approximately 6,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry. With the force assembled, Charles sent a group of heralds, escorted by 1,000 musketeers, forward at approximately 2:00 pm, at which point they read out the King&#x27;s demands to a meeting of 26 local council and garrison officers, including Massie. The King&#x27;s announcement was that if the officers submitted, he would pardon all the officers, prohibit his army from causing any damage to the city, and leave only a small garrison behind. If they did not, he would take the city by force, and the inhabitants would be responsible &quot;for all the calamities and miseries that must befall them&quot;. Despite earlier claims that Massie would surrender, he did not; a short time later, a refusal of the offer was drawn up and unanimously signed by the officers. The reasons for Massie&#x27;s failure to surrender the city, despite the feelers he put out to Royalist contacts, are unknown.

At this point, Charles called another council of war to discuss the situation. It was resolved that it was crucial that Gloucester was still to be taken; if it was left in Parliamentarian hands, it would act as a break in lines of communication should the Royalists advance further east towards London. In addition, Charles&#x27;s personal reputation had been sullied – travelling so far and yet not taking Gloucester would affect the respect and prestige accorded to him, about which he was &quot;notoriously sensitive&quot;. Based on reconnaissance, Charles&#x27;s officers were confident that the garrison&#x27;s food and ammunition would not last long; they argued that the city could be taken in less than 10 days, with Parliament lacking an effective army to relieve the city. If Essex&#x27;s forces did not attack, the Royalists would take the city. If they did attack, they would be exhausted and, according to Royalist intelligence, far weaker than the Oxford army, allowing Charles to destroy Parliament&#x27;s one remaining significant force.

Under the direct command of the Earl of Forth, the Royalists laid siege to the city; Rupert had suggested a direct assault, but this proposal was not adopted due to fears of high casualties. By 11 August, the Royalist trenches were dug and the artillery prepared, despite Massie&#x27;s attempts to disrupt work with musket fire. With this work done, there was no way out for the Parliamentarians; the only hope was to delay the Royalists long enough for a relief army to arrive. To this end, Massie ordered raids under the cover of darkness, with James Harcus, his second-in-command, leading a raid on the artillery trenches. In revenge the Royalists attacked the east of the city, but were driven off by cannon fire. 12 August saw more raids, this time during the day, which cost the Royalists 10 men and a supply depot, with no Parliamentarian losses. Despite this, the assaults did not disrupt Royalist preparations and by the evening they were able to start bombarding the town.

By 24 August, the Royalists, suffering from shortfalls in their stocks of gunpowder and cannonballs, remained unable to breach the walls. Essex, in the meantime, had been urgently preparing his army, which thanks to disease, indiscipline and desertion numbered less than 6,000 infantry and 3,500 cavalry. This was not a force strong enough to defeat the Royalists, and so he demanded an extra 5,000 soldiers; Parliamentarians in London responded by mobilising a brigade of the London Trained Bands, which provided an additional 6,000 men. Taking into account additional problems and desertions, the eventual force was 9,000-foot soldiers and 5,000 cavalry. After being mustered on Hounslow Heath, the army began marching towards Aylesbury, arriving on 28 August. This force was formally mustered on 30 August, and after being reinforced by Lord Grey on 1 September at Brackley, marched to Gloucester. On 5 September, with heavy rain falling, the Parliamentarian army reached the town and camped on Prestbury Hill, immediately outside it; their presence forced the Royalists to abandon the siege given that neither army, wet and exhausted, was in a state to seek battle.

===Pursuit===
Charles&#x27;s cautious failure to directly assault the town, putting a higher priority on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex&#x27;s force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue was the lack of supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex had no choice but to try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles&#x27;s cavalry on open ground.

The first alternative was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross it, going through Newbury and returning to Reading&#x27;s fortifications, thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London. The disadvantage to this was the time it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex&#x27;s position and the Kennet. The second, and the option Essex initially took, was to go north, either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists. If Essex was able to cross to the west bank of the River Avon, he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army. His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September, with the rest of the soldiers quickly following. The Royalists were left wrong-footed; Charles did not discover Essex&#x27;s retreat for another 24 hours, during which the gap between the armies widened. The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September, with Rupert&#x27;s cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat.

By 18 September, Rupert&#x27;s force had caught up to the Parliamentarians outside Aldbourne, Wiltshire. Essex had lost his advantage; Parliamentarian intelligence reports had convinced him that Charles was heading towards Oxford and had given up the campaign. In fact Charles was barely away, but the complacency such reports induced meant that one contemporary source stated the Parliamentarians were marching barely a day, allowing the Royalists to quickly catch up. Suitably chastened by the discovery of his error, Essex increased the pace of his retreat, with the Royalists pursuing closely. Both sides were heading for Newbury, on roughly parallel routes; the Royalists&#x27; route took them through Faringdon and Wantage, increasing the distance they would have to travel to while the Parliamentarians had to travel only 20. Charles reacted by dispatching Rupert and 7,000 cavalry in a flying column to disrupt and harass the Parliamentary retreat. Encountering Essex&#x27;s forces at Aldbourne Chase, Rupert made battle; however, lacking enough troops to engage the Parliamentarians directly, he instead attacked a section of their army, causing chaos and crucially delaying Essex&#x27;s march just enough for Charles&#x27;s forces to close the gap.

The effect of Rupert&#x27;s actions, even after his forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded soldiers and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.

==Newbury==

===Landscape===

The landscape of the area around Newbury was a significant factor in the tactics of both sides during the resulting battle. Though the land was mostly open country, a crescent-shaped escarpment known as Biggs Hill sat between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces. To either side of Essex&#x27;s army lay open fields, while the battlefield was bracketed by the River Kennet on one side and the River Enborne on the other, which neither side attempted to cross on foot. Essex&#x27;s most obvious route of advance was to push past the Royalist forces, secure the bridge and return to London. Unfortunately, the open area approaching the bridge was a &quot;killing ground&quot;; soldiers would be entirely in the open and forced to march no more than six abreast, which would prevent Essex effectively deploying against a Royalist attack and leave the Parliamentarian&#x27;s forces bunched up and subject to artillery fire. Even if Essex managed to cross the bridge, the other side of the river featured several hundred metres of waterlogged ground, which would slow his soldiers and leave them open to attack while necessitating the abandonment of the Parliamentarian artillery, a &quot;major humiliation for a seventeenth-century army&quot;.

The only alternative to a bridge-based retreat would be to bypass Newbury completely by marching around the Royalists, but this would again involve moving through open fields and subjecting Essex&#x27;s soldiers to the attacks of Royalist cavalry, who were described as greatly outnumbering the Parliamentarian cavalry. Confronting the Royalists directly would involve moving into ground described as containing &quot;dense copses and innumerable banked hedges with ditches flanking fields and lining sunken lanes&quot;; while this would allow the troops to move in a concealed fashion, it would also make deployment difficult, and the numerous lanes would restrict movement in the heat of battle.

===Order of battle===
There are no definitive orders of battle for Newbury, as official contemporary evidence is thin; it is possible to glean some information from both later official reports and contemporary accounts, which allow for a reconstruction of the likely disposition of each force. The Royalists were led by Charles I personally, with William Vavasour commanding the right wing, Prince Rupert the left, and Sir John Byron the centre. Artillery support consisted of 20 cannons in total: 6 heavy, 6 medium and 8 light. Initial Royalist and Parliamentarian estimates were of a force of around 17,000 men; modern estimates are of around 7,500 infantry, and 7,000 cavalry. Essex led the Parliamentarians, commanding both the entire force and, separately, the right wing; the left wing was commanded by Philip Stapleton. Artillery support was provided by two heavy cannons and around 20 light cannons; most of the heavy artillery was left at Gloucester to help defend the city. Estimates as to the total number of men vary between 7,000 and 15,000; John Barratt, noting the losses at Gloucester, estimates that Essex&#x27;s force totalled around 14,000 men, with 6,000 cavalry and dragoons and 8,000 infantry.

==Battle==

===Essex attacks===
The battle began on 20 September; Essex&#x27;s army was roused before dawn, and initial reports stated he had gone &quot;from regiment to regiment...[putting] the question of a battle unto them&quot;. After consultation, the army advanced with &quot;most cheerful and courageous spirits&quot; at around 7 am. Divided into &quot;three bodies of Foot, both lined and flanked with bodies of Horse&quot;, with a reserve behind them, the army was preceded by Stapleton&#x27;s cavalry, which quickly cleared the Royalist pickets and allowed Essex&#x27;s advance to Wash Common, a patch of open ground between the two forces. This march took approximately an hour due to the heavy clay soil being soaked from the previous night&#x27;s rain; the open space before Biggs Hill, the objective of their march, allowed for a much welcome chance to regroup. Rupert had established a cavalry guard on Biggs Hill; while the size is unknown, it was large enough to attack the Parliamentarian horse head-on. Stapleton waited until the Royalists were close before firing, leading to the faltering of their charge and the advance of the Parliamentarian cavalry to drive them off with swords. The cavalry were unable to make further gains, having engaged only a small part of the Royalist horse and being unwilling to press their attack against the larger body.

Led by Philip Skippon, the Parliamentarian right flank attacked their main objective, nearby Round Hill; their account reported they &quot;charged so fiercely that [they] beat [the Royalists] from the hill&quot;, but makes no mention of casualties or what happened to the Royalist guns which were allegedly deployed on the hill. The Royalists claimed the hill was undefended; the facts suggest this was closer to the truth and &quot;the king and his generals had been caught napping&quot;. Its capture allowed Skippon to position 1,000 musketeers on top, who could fire down into any Royalist advance.

===Royalist counter-attack===
As a result of this quick advance, Charles found his army in chaos, with Skippon&#x27;s force organised and flanking them. The Royalist council of war reconvened to discuss the events, and accounts suggest the meeting was acrimonious, with the fall of Round Hill described as &quot;a most gross and absurd error&quot;. Rupert decided to try to contain both Essex and Skippon. Leaving two regiments of horse with Byron, he led the remainder of the cavalry to Essex&#x27;s position on the left flank. Byron, in the meantime, was commanded to support an attack by the Royalist musketeers on Skippon&#x27;s force, drawing his regiments up behind the infantry &quot;ready to second them in case the enemy&#x27;s horse should advance towards them&quot;. Rupert&#x27;s advance has been criticised by both Parliamentarian and Royalist sources; instead of a small engagement, the stubbornness of the Parliamentary resistance forced Rupert to commit more and more forces to the fray, eventually turning a series of small engagements into a full-scale battle, with reinforcements gradually being drawn in. The terrain limited the localised advantage Rupert&#x27;s forces had in numbers, but after three attacks Stapleton&#x27;s brigade crumbled, allowing Rupert to hook around Essex&#x27;s left flank, stop his advance and capture five pieces of artillery. This came at a cost; the Royalists took heavy casualties, and failed to completely break Essex&#x27;s infantry. The infantry instead stubbornly retreated, allowing the Parliamentary cavalry to reorganise behind them. Even though his advance had been stopped, Essex was not yet beaten.

Byron&#x27;s attack on Skippon&#x27;s musketeers in the centre also went poorly. Pushing three regiments of foot forward, the force suffered similarly high casualties in an attempt to take Round Hill; after the attack stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The attack eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot, which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on attack forced Skippon&#x27;s beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight turning into a bloody melee. Vavasour&#x27;s force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.

===Crisis and stalemate===
After heavy fighting, the Royalists had succeeded only in pushing Essex&#x27;s forces briefly back; they had given ground but not retreated from the battle, and his main force of infantry remained strong. In an attempt to proceed, Essex waved his infantry and light artillery forward. Rupert&#x27;s cavalry was too weak to defend against this advance due to its large firepower, and he instead ordered two regiments of foot commanded by John Belasyse to halt Essex. The Parliamentarian records report they were &quot;hotly charged by the enemies&#x27; horse and foot&quot;, who succeeded in forcing Essex slowly back, although the fight took four hours. In response, Essex called for Skippon to send him reinforcements; Skippon obliged by ordering a Mainwaring&#x27;s Regiment of infantry to remove themselves from his line and march to replace some of Essex&#x27;s exhausted soldiers. As soon as they arrived, they were charged by two bodies of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under John Byron, who forced the regiment to retreat; the Royalists hacked down the fleeing Parliamentarians and, according to Byron, his force &quot;had not left a man of them unkilled, but that the hedges were so high the horse could not pursue them&quot;. Although the Royalists failed to press this attack due to the difficulty of manoeuvring cavalry in the field, and Essex briefly retook the ground, the loss of this infantry regiment opened a gap in the Parliamentarian line. If Rupert was able to drive through this gap, he would break Essex&#x27;s army into two wings and be able to encircle them. Recognizing this possibility, he began redeploying the Royalist force: two regiments of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under his command would occupy Essex, while two regiments under Charles Gerard would push through the gap in the Parliamentarian line.

Luckily for the Parliamentarians, Skippon saw this opening and ordered the Red and Blue Regiments of the London Trained Bands to close the gap. Although they succeeded in bridging the gap between the two wings of Essex&#x27;s force, there was no cover, and a Royalist battery of eight heavy guns drawn up on high ground began firing on them. Unable to move because of the necessity of their position, they were left enduring close-range fire &quot;when men&#x27;s bowels and brains flew in [their] faces&quot;, resisting two attacks by Royalist cavalry and infantry led by Jacob Astley. Historian John Day notes that records show most Trained Band casualties were hit in the head, while a survivor boasted that the artillery &quot;did us no harm, only the shot broke our pikes&quot;; evidently, in the heat of battle, the Royalist artillery were firing too high. Despite this, the Royalist artillery fire had taken its toll, and the Trained Band regiments were forced to retreat. The Royalists pursued, and only close-quarters musket fire allowed the militia to regroup without substantial losses. After regrouping, the militia was again attacked by two regiments of foot and two of cavalry, who despite surrounding the Londoners and dragging away a cannon were unable to break them.

At this point, both armies began to draw apart; although sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex&#x27;s plan to force his way past the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loath to give up the ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.

==Aftermath==

The Parliamentarian force, now free of Charles&#x27;s army, retreated towards Aldermaston as quickly as possible and eventually made it to Reading and then London, where Essex received a hero&#x27;s welcome. The Royalists, on the other hand, were forced to spend the next day recovering their casualties, finding more than a thousand injured soldiers who were sent back to Oxford. After they finished recovering their dead and wounded men, the Royalists left 200 infantry, 25 cavalry and 4 guns in Donnington Castle to defend their rear and then marched to Oxford, having buried their dead senior officers in Newbury Guildhall. Casualties at Newbury eventually came to approximately 1,300 losses for the Royalists, and 1,200 for the Parliamentarians. The loss at Newbury was due to a multitude of factors; Day gives credit to the greater ability of Essex to conserve his force through the campaign, which put the Royalists at a numerical disadvantage by Newbury, and notes the Royalist over-reliance on cavalry, with Essex &quot;[compensating] for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower&quot;, countering Rupert&#x27;s cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations. The Royalists&#x27; infantry were also outperformed, Essex&#x27;s force retaining a high level of cohesiveness while the Royalists were described as relatively unprofessional; both Day and Blair Worden also give the paucity of ammunition and gunpowder as an important (and endemic) deciding factor in the success or failure of Charles&#x27; campaign.

Although the attention of historians is normally on the larger battles such as Edgehill and Marston Moor, several historians who have studied the period consider the First Battle of Newbury to be the defining moment of the First English Civil War, both as the high point of the Royalist advance and as the &quot;one bright period of [Essex&#x27;s] generalship&quot;. John Day writes that &quot;Militarily and politically, Parliament&#x27;s position at the beginning of October 1643 was demonstrably far stronger than in late July. With hindsight, the capture of Bristol was the high tide of King Charles&#x27; war, his best and only chance of ending the conflict on his own terms&quot;. John Barratt noted that the Royalists had failed in &quot;what might prove to have been their best chance to destroy the principle field army of their opponents, and hopes of a crushing victory which would bring down the Parliamentarian &#x27;war party&#x27; lay in ruins&quot;. The high Parliamentarian feelings after Newbury led to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant, bringing a powerful Scottish army down to assault the Royalists. &quot;Thanks to the failure...to win a decisive victory there, the English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish subjects of all of King Charles&#x27; Three Kingdoms would henceforth play a bloody price in a steadily widening and deepening war&quot;.

===Sources and historiography===
Malcolm Wanklyn has described the First Battle of Newbury as being &quot;both the longest battle of the English Civil War and the one that historians have found the greatest difficulty in describing&quot;, because there is no contemporary plan of the battlefield or record of the plans of each side while, conversely, there are diverse and contradictory accounts from both sides of the battle. An official Royalist account was written by Lord Digby on 22 September, which suffered from defects due to Digby&#x27;s position away from the main fighting, and because it was designed &quot;as a reflection on the battle&#x27;s outcome, not a blow-by-blow description of what happened&quot;. Conversely, those written by officers who actively fought in the main arenas of the battle are very narrow in focus, for example, the accounts of Joshua Moone and John Gwyn, commoners who fought on Wash Common, and an anonymous tract from the perspective of a soldier who assaulted Round Hill.

On the Parliamentarian side, an official source was published a month after the battle; due to the circumstances of its publication and the high Parliamentarian morale after Newbury, it made no attempt to gloss over errors and was designed to &quot;explain to a lay readership what had happened on the battlefield&quot;. A more narrow view was taken by Sergeant Henry Foster, who fought with the London Trained Band in their attempt to prevent the Royalists splitting Essex&#x27;s army. The diary of Walter Yonge of Colyton also contains two reports written for the House of Commons by Essex&#x27;s generals, including Stapleton, although the originals have been lost.

<text>Sun Ferry Services Company Limited, more widely known as Sun Ferry () and formerly New World First Ferry Services Limited (in short New World First Ferry, First Ferry or NWFF), is a ferry service company in Hong Kong. The company was established in November 1999, when it took over the eight licensed ferry routes transferred from Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in January 2000.

== Background ==
When the company commenced its service on 15 January 2000, it bought 14 ferries and rented seven hovercraft and catamarans from its predecessor. Since then it has introduced 10 fast vessels on Outlying Islands routes to phase out the rented vessels and to improve services.

It used to have a subsidiary, New World First Ferry Services (Macau) Limited (abbreviated New World First Ferry (Macau)), which operated a high-speed ferry service between Kowloon (China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui) and Macau (Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Pier). In 2011, it was sold to Shun Tak–China Travel Ship Management Limited, the owner of TurboJET. That subsidiary has now been renamed.

== Routes ==
It operates the following routes:
*Central to Cheung Chau and Mui Wo
*Circular between Peng Chau, Mui Wo, Chi Ma Wan, and Cheung Chau
*North Point to Hung Hom and Kowloon City
*North Point to Joss House Bay (大廟灣) (special service which only operates on Tin Hau-birthday-festival)

Ceased routes:
*Central to Peng Chau
*Tsim Sha Tsui to Mui Wo and Cheung Chau
*Tuen Mun to Tai O (via: Tung Chung and Sha Lo Wan)
*Tuen Mun to Chek Lap Kok / Tung Chung

Inter-cities
* Hong Kong to Macau (sold to TurboJET in 2011)

==Ownership==
New World First Ferry was owned by NWS Holdings via NWS Transport Services. In the past, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, parent company of NWS Holdings, owned 50% shares of NWS Transport Services until 2016.

New World First Ferry and NWS Holdings are named after New World Development, the flagship listed company of Chow Tai Fook group.

In May 2020, New World First Ferry was sold to Chinese government owned Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises. Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises is the parent company of Chu Kong Passenger Transport, which offers inter-cities passenger liner, for cities of the Pearl River Delta. Chu Kong is the alternative transliteration of Pearl River.

Following the sale, formal registration of the change of company name to Sun Ferry Services Company Limited took effect on 7 January 2021 in Hong Kong&#x27;s Companies Registry.

<text>Repressuring is a common method of increasing the pressure inside of a crude oil well in order to increase the output of the well. Pumping crude oil from a reservoir causes its pressure to drop, which further reduces pumpability. Returning the natural gas or other inert gases to the oil well increases the pumpability of the crude present inside the well by decreasing its viscosity and density. In one instance, slower rate of oil production and recycling of natural gas at 9.6 MPa enabled a net recovery of 70% of the oil originally present.

Although recovery can be increased even by repressuring with air, air is seldom used because it causes an inferior quality of product. Instead carbon dioxide or natural gas itself is used so as to not only increase the recovery from the oil well but also to maintain the high quality of the product.

<text>The China Motor Bus Company, Limited (), often abbreviated as CMB, is a property developer based in Hong Kong. Before its busfranchise lapsed in 1998, it was the first motor bus operator in Hong Kong, and was responsible for the introduction of the iconic double-decker buses to Hong Kong Island. Currently CMB does not run any transport services and has since shifted into property development as an alternative means of profit.

==History==


Ngan Shing-kwan and Wong Yiu Nam formed the China Motor Bus Company, Limited, in 1923 to provide transport services in the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. Prior to this, Ngan had operated a rickshaw business also within the Kowloon Peninsula. In 1933, the company received an exclusive bus franchise agreement from the Government of Hong Kong to operate routes on Hong Kong Island.

After World War II, the network of CMB&#x27;s routes expanded alongside exploding population on the island. New buses were purchased to increase ridership. In the mid-1970s, a livery of a buff upper body and a blue lower body was adopted. CMB adopted a policy of improving its service during the 1970s, by introducing a new type of rear-engined bus (Daimler Fleetline) and reforming the route number system. In 1976 CMB earned over $20 million HKD, the highest profit in the company&#x27;s history.

With the opening of the MTR Island line in 1985, and CMB&#x27;s growing reputation of poor services, CMB ridership began to decline. On 29–30 November 1989, CMB employees organised a strike, after negotiations on pension funds broke down. During the strike, all CMB services on Hong Kong island were halted. This forced the government to use police vehicles to replace services for commuters travelling to and from the Southern District of Hong Kong. After this incident, the relationship between CMB and the government worsened, leading to the government to adopt more directive policies in respect of CMB.

Meanwhile, competitors such as Citybus Limited had successfully lured passengers from CMB&#x27;s franchised routes to their own residential routes. Their services provided more comfortable seats, an air-conditioned fleet, and a more direct route (via the Aberdeen Tunnel) from Chi Fu Fa Yuen to Admiralty. Citybus were able to compete against CMB by only the fares on routes which paralleled the more uncomfortable and indirect CMB counterparts.

In 1993, the government redistributed 26 of CMB&#x27;s routes to Citybus, citing poor service levels. In 1995, a further 14 were transferred.

In February 1998, the government announced the franchise for all 140 routes operated by CMB would not be renewed when it expired on 31 August 1998. Eighty-eight of the routes were placed to open tender, 12 routes were transferred directly to Citybus, one cross-harbour route to Kowloon Motor Bus Company Limited (KMB), and the remaining routes were cancelled.

A joint venture named New World First Holdings (NWFH), later New World First Bus Company, (NWFB), was formed by the Hong Kong-based NWS Holdings and UK based FirstGroup plc. Despite being a dark horse candidate, and never having operated transport routes before, NWFH won the tender for the CMB routes and commenced operations with around 50 new buses and 710 former CMB buses. In 2020, NWFB was acquired by Bravo Transport, the current owner of CityBus. In 2023, Citybus and NWFB were merged with the NWFB brand being retired.

==Current status==
Since losing its franchising rights, CMB&#x27;s main business focus has shifted to real estate, by redeveloping its former bus depot properties. There was a free shuttle bus service operated by the company between Island Place (one of the CMB&#x27;s real estate developments) near the North Point MTR station and North Point Government Offices with a Volvo B6LE, acquired from Citybus, along with eight Marshall C37 bodied Dennis Darts. However, this service ceased on 30 June 2015 as the new environmental protection ordinance began to phase out pre Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles.

China Motor Bus has also sincepurchased some properties in London.

==Fleet==
Besides the eight Dennis Dart Coach Express retained to operate the free shuttle service, most of the fleet was transferred to New World First Bus in 1998 after the end of CMB&#x27;s franchise. Two Volvo Olympian air-conditioned buses were retained, being sold to Citybus in 2001 with a Volvo B6LE acquired in return.

Some of the buses transferred to New World First Bus were later sold to City Sightseeing in Australia and The Original Tour in London.

<text>The azimuthal equidistant projection is an azimuthal map projection. It has the useful properties that all points on the map are at proportionally correct distances from the center point, and that all points on the map are at the correct azimuth (direction) from the center point. A useful application for this type of projection is a polar projection which shows all meridians (lines of longitude) as straight, with distances from the pole represented correctly.

The flag of the United Nations contains an example of a polar azimuthal equidistant projection.

== History ==
While it may have been used by ancient Egyptians for star maps in some holy books, the earliest text describing the azimuthal equidistant projection is an 11th-century work by al-Biruni. The first use of the projection on a terrestrial map is the pair of hemispheres by Glareanus of about 1510. Another early example of this system is the world map by ‛Ali b. Ahmad al-Sharafi of Sfax in 1571.

The projection appears in many Renaissance maps, and Gerardus Mercator used it for an inset of the north polar regions in sheet 13 and legend 6 of his well-known 1569 map. In France and Russia this projection is named &quot;Postel projection&quot; after Guillaume Postel, who used it for a map in 1581. Many modern star chart planispheres use the polar azimuthal equidistant projection.


The polar azimuthal equidistant projection has also been adopted by 21st century Flat Earthers as a map of the Flat Earth, particularly due to its use in the UN flag and its depiction of Antarctica as a ring around the edge of the Earth.

== Mathematical definition ==

A point on the globe is chosen as &quot;the center&quot; in the sense that mapped distances and azimuth directions from that point to any other point will be correct. That point, (&quot;φ&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;), will project to the center of a circular projection, with &quot;φ&quot; referring to latitude and &quot;λ&quot; referring to longitude. All points along a given azimuth will project along a straight line from the center, and the angle &quot;θ&quot; that the line subtends from the vertical is the azimuth angle. The distance from the center point to another projected point &quot;ρ&quot; is the arc length along a great circle between them on the globe. By this description, then, the point on the plane specified by (&quot;θ&quot;,&quot;ρ&quot;) will be projected to Cartesian coordinates:
:formula_1

The relationship between the coordinates (&quot;θ&quot;,&quot;ρ&quot;) of the point on the globe, and its latitude and longitude coordinates (&quot;φ&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;) is given by the equations:

:formula_2

When the center point is the north pole, &quot;φ&quot;0 equals formula_3 and &quot;λ&quot; is arbitrary, so it is most convenient to assign it the value of 0. This assignment significantly simplifies the equations for &quot;ρ&quot;u and &quot;θ&quot; to:
:formula_4

== Limitation ==
With the circumference of the Earth being approximately , the maximum distance that can be displayed on an azimuthal equidistant projection map is half the circumference, or about . For distances less than distortions are minimal. For distances the distortions are moderate. Distances greater than are severely distorted.

If the azimuthal equidistant projection map is centered about a point whose antipodal point lies on land and the map is extended to the maximum distance of the antipode point smears into a large circle. This is shown in the example of two maps centered about Los Angeles, and Taipei. The antipode for Los Angeles is in the south Indian Ocean hence there is not much significant distortion of land masses for the Los Angeles centered map except for East Africa and Madagascar. On the other hand, Taipei&#x27;s antipode is near the Argentina–Paraguay border, causing the Taipei centered map to severely distort South America.

== Applications ==

Azimuthal equidistant projection maps can be useful in terrestrial point to point communication. This type of projection allows the operator to easily determine in which direction to point their directional antenna. The operator simply finds on the map the location of the target transmitter or receiver (i.e. the other antenna being communicated with) and uses the map to determine the azimuth angle needed to point the operator&#x27;s antenna. The operator would use an electric rotator to point the antenna. The map can also be used in one way communication. For example if the operator is looking to receive signals from a distant radio station, this type of projection could help identify the direction of the distant radio station. In order for the map to be useful, the map should be centered as close as possible about the location of the operator&#x27;s antenna.
Azimuthal equidistant projection maps can also be useful to show ranges of ballistic missiles, as demonstrated by the map centered on North Korea showing the country&#x27;s missile range.
